PRINTED SI R. v. WALDHE1M IN VIENNA.PREFACE sixteen years ago, „Heitzrn aim's Anatomischer Atlas" was first published. Since that time the work has been one of the princi- pal works on anatomy in use in German and Austrian universities, and more than 30.000 copies of it have been sold. As the work is now offered to the English reading medical public, it is by no means an exact translation from the German, and, especially in the second part, the text was often materially altered, in order to bring it more in unison with the leading English works, such as Gray and Q.uain. It will be noticed that a good many Latin words were allowed to remain in the figures, even where such words are not in general use in the English text books; wherever this was done, the corresponding English word was almost invariably added to the text, so that, even for those not well versed in Latin, there would be no difficulty in under- standing them. - With the exception only of those figures especially so men- tioned, the illustrations were all drawn on wood by the author, either from nature, or from preparations in the anatomical museum at Vienna, In its present, slightly altered form, it is hoped that the work will serve both as an aid to the medical student, and as a work of reference to the physician.

Occipital Boiie, Os OCClpitis, from before. The occipital bone is divided into 4 portions: 1. basilar portion; 2. occipital portion; 3- and 4- two condyloid portions. 1. Basilar portion. The upper surface presents a sulcus for the Medulla oblongata. The anterior surface borders on the body of the sphenoid bone; the lateral surfaces articulate with the petrous portions of the temporal bones. 2. Occipital portion. In the middle of the anterior surface is the internal occipital protuberance, Protuherantia occipitalis internet, which is in the center of the Erninentia cruciata interna; the lower half of the perpendicular crus is called the internal occipital crest, Crista occipitalis interna (for the Sinus occipitalis and the Falx cerebeMi); the upper half forms the longitudinal sulcus (for the longitudinal sinus); the two transverse crura contain the transverse sulcus (for the lateral sinus and attachment of the Tentorium cerebelli). In both upper fossae lie the occipital lobes of the cereb- rum ; in the lower the 2 hemispheres of the cerebellum. 1*Bones of the Cranium. 4 2. Occipital Bone, Os OCcipitis, from behind. 2. Occipital portion with the external occipital protuberance, Protuberantia occipitalis externa, from which runs the external occipital crest, Crista occipitalis externa, to the Foramen magnum; transversely run both Lineae semicirculares externae, i. e. the superior and inferior curved lines (for the insertion of muscles and ligaments). The borders are the superior, Margo lambdoideus, for articulation with both parietal bones, and the inferior, Margo mastoideus, for articulation with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone.Bones of the Cranium. 5 3. Occipital'Bone, Os occipitis, from below. 3. and 4- Condyloid portions. On the upper surface (Fig. l) the Processus anonymus; on the lower surface both condyloid processes for articulation with the atlas; behind these the flat condyloid fossae. In front of the condyloid process lies the anterior condyloid foramen (a short canal for the XII. pair of cranial nerves). The posterior condyloid foramen is not always present (for an Emissarium Santorim). The inner border of the condyloid portions forms the lateral border of the Foramen magnum; the outer border shows the jugular notch, Incisura jugularis, and at its posterior end the jugular process. The upper surface of the process presents a groove (for the lateral sinus of the Dura mater). The occipital bone articulates with G bones: with the 2 parietal bones, the 2 temporal bones, with the sphenoid bone and with the first cervical vertebra (atlas).Bones, of the Cranium. 4. Sphenoid Bone, Os sphenoideum, from above. The sphenoid bone is divided into: 1. the body, 2. the wings; the latter form 3 pairs: a) the lesser wings, Alae minor es; b) the greater wings, Alae rnagnae, and c) the wing like or pterygoid processes, Processus pterygoidei. Body. On the upper surface the pituitary fossa or Sella turcica (for the Hypophysis cerebri); its posterior wall, the Dorsum sellae or ephippii, with the posterior clinoid processes, Processus clinoidei postici. The posterior surface of the Dorsum sellae is continuous with the basilar groove of the occipital bone-Clivus. In front of the pituitary fossa the Tuberculum ephippii; on both sides of this the middle clinoid processes. On the lateral surfaces of the body the cavernous groove, Sulcus caroticus (for the Carotis) with the Lingula. Lesser wings; each arises from the body by 2 roots, between which is the optic foramen; the ends looking toward the Dorsum sellae. form the anterior clinoid processes, Processus clinoidei anteriores. Greater wings each with three surfaces and three borders. The cerebral surface, Svperfieies cerebralis, with the furrow for the middle meningeal artery and vein.

Sphenoid Bone, Os sphenoideum, from before. Body. On the anterior surface are two irregular openings, which lead into the sphenoidal sinuses, and are separated from each other by the Crista sphenoidalis; this becomes elongated in front, forming the Rostrum sphenoidale. The pterygoid processes are formed of two plates, the exter- nal and internal pterygoid plates, Lamina ptenjgoidea externa et interna, separated behind by an intervening notch, the Fossa ptenjgoidea; the inner plate ends in the hamular process, Hamulus pterygoideus. Between both plates is the Incisura pterygoidea (Fig. 6). At the base of the pterygoid process is the Vidian canal, running in a horizontal direction, and from whose anterior opening the pterygo-palatine groove, Sulcus pterygopala- tine, passes in a downward course. The Ossicula Bertini or sphenoidal turbinated bones are triangular bones, partially covering the openings of the sphenoidal sinuses, which latter are situated on the anterior wall of the body of the sphenoid bone.Bones of the Cranium. 8 pterygoid. 0.

Frontal Bone, Os front is, from behind. Frontal portion. The inner surface is divided by the frontal crest, Crista frontalis, into 2 halves; on both sides are Pacchionian depressions. The border of the frontal portion, Margo coronalis, commences behind the zygomatic process with a triangular, serrated surface. The two orbital portions are separated from each other by the ethmoidal notch, Incisurd ethmoidalis; on the inferior surface close to the zygomatic rjrocess is the lachrymal fossa, Fovea glandidae lacrymalis; toward the nasal portion a depression, Foveola troehlearis, sometimes the Hamulus trocldcaris (for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye). The inner border is broad and cellular, the compartments leading to the frontal sinuses, Sinus frontal.es; between the outer edge of the inner border and the contiguous Lamina papyrucea of the ethmoid bone are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, Foramen ethmoidale antcrius et For. ethm. posterius; the latter sometimes formed only by the frontal bone. On the nasal portion behind the superior nasal spine is the Foramen coecum (for a vein) ; , above it the Incisura nasalis.

The cribriform plate is divided into 2 halves by the Crista ethmoidalis, which, projecting upward, forms the Crista galli. The cribri- form plate is perforated by the Foramina cribrosa. From its under sur- face the perpendicular plate (Fig. 10), which forms the upper part of the bony Septum narium, decends. The labyrinth (Fig. ll) is divided into the ethmoidal cells, Cellulae ethmoidales (anterior, middle and posterior), which are closed externally by the Lamina ixqv/raeea (Os planum): internally they are limited by the superior and inferior ethmoidal turbinated bones, Concha ,ethmoidalis superior et inferior, between which lies the superior meatus of the nose, Meatus narium superior. From the anterior end of the inferior ethmoidal turbinated bone (middle turbinated bone), and from the lower walls of the anterior ethmoidal cells, there projects the thin, serrated unciform process, Processus uncinatus.

Of the latter the one along the upper border forms with the one on the bone of the other side, a channel for the superior longitudinal sinus, Sinus longitudinal is superior; the second, at the posterior inferior angle of the bone is for the transverse sinus. In the posterior superior angle of the figure a Wormian bone, Ossiculum suturarum, Wormianum, is represented. The parietal bone articulates with 5 bones, with the parietal bone of the other side, the occipital bone, the frontal bone, the temporal bone and the sphenoid bone.14 Bones of the Cranium. 14. Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from the outside. The temporal hone is divided into 3 parts: 1. tk squamous portion, Pais squamosa s. Squama, 2. the petrous portion, Pars pttrosa, and 3- the mastoid portion, Pars mastoidea. The squamous portion has on the outer surface in front and above the Meatus auditorius externus, the zygomatic process, Processus zygomaticus, formed by 2 roots; between the roots the glenoid fossa, Fossa glenoidalis (for the condyle of the inferior maxilla) ; in front of this, the Eminentia articidaris or Tuberculum articularc. The furrow for the temporal artery is not constant. The mastoid portion shows on the outer surface the mastoid process, Proc&ssxis mastoldeus, which is grooved from below by the Incisura mastoidea, and is limited at the posterior periphery of the external auditory meatus by the Fissura tympamo-mastoidta (in this the end orifice of the Canaliculus mastoidms). The borders are: the superior, strongly serrated, for articulation with the Angulus mastoidms of the parietal bone, and the posterior, slightly serrated for articulation with the inferior portion of the lateral border of the occipital bone.15 Bones of the Cranium. 15, Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from the inner side. The squamous p.ortion shows on its internal surface strong- eminences and depressions for the cerebral convolutions, Tmpressiones digitatae and Juga cerebralia, and 2 grooves (for the middle meningeal artery and vein). The petrous portion has 3 surfaces (posterior, superior and inferior) and 3 borders (superior, anterior and posterior). On the smallest posterior surface the oval orifice of the Meatus auditonus interims (Meatus acusticus interims), 3"' externally of this, that of the Aquaeductus vestibxdi: The largest superior surf a c e is separated from the squamous portion by the Sutura (Fissura) petroso-squamosa; it has an eminence for the superior semicircular canal, Eminentia canalis scmicircu- laris superioris. Near the summit of the pyramid the inner opening of the carotid canal, Canalis caroticus, from which a groove (Semicanalis Nervi Vidiami) leads externally -to a small foramen, the Hiatus (Apertura spuria) canalis Fallopiae. In this groove opens the small Canalicidus petrosus. The upper border of the petrous portion is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, Sulcus petrosus superior: the posterior border excavated by the Incisura jugularis. The mastoid portion shows on its inner surface a deep groove, Fossa sigmoidea (for 1 he Sinus transversus); a foramen, not always present, the Foramen mastoidcum (for an Emissarium Santorini), leads from this groove to the external surface of the bone.Bones of the Cranium. 16 10. Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from below. The inferior surface of the p etrous p o r t i o n forms at its external part a small plate of bone, Os tyinpanicum, which surrounds the Meatus auditorius extemus interiorly and anteriorly, and is separated from the glenoid fossa of the squamous portion by the Glaserian fissure, Fissura Glaseri (Fig. 14). Passing from within outward we have: the Foramen stylo-mastoidcum, below the external auditory meatus (termination of the Aquacductus Fallopii); the Processus Styloideus ; the Fossa jugular is with the small orifice of the Canali- culus mastoideus. — Near the jugular fossa the lower opening of the Canalis caroticus, and above this two small canals, CanaUeuli carotico-tympanici [to the tympanic carity); toward the posterior border the triangular orifice of the Aquacductus cochleae, Between the Incisura jugularis and the lower opening of the carotid canal lies the Fossula petrosa, with the origin of the Canaliculus tympanicus. At the shortest anterior border of the petrous portion (at its outer end), lies an opening divided into 2 halves by a thin plate of bone; the upper smaller one is the commencement of the Semi- canalis tmsoris tympani, the lower one the opening of the Tid>a Eustachu.Bones of the Cranium.

In the first year of life the temporal bone consists of three pieces: a) Squamous portion, Pars squamosa, b) Auditory process or Annulus tym- panicus, and c) Petroso-mastoid portion, Pars petroso-mastoidea. The Pars petrosa-inastoidea is separated from the Pars squamosa by the Sutura petroso- squamosa and the Mssura mastoideo-squamosa (Jos. G-ruber). The Annulus tympanicus contains the Membrana tympani; in the tympanic cavity, Cavum tympani (behind the Membrana tympani) the Foramen ovale and Foramen rotundum can be seen. The temporal bone articulates with 5 bones: with the occipital, the parietal, the sphenoid, the malar and the inferior maxillary bones. Heitzmann, Atlas. I.18 Bones of the Cranium. 19.

Right Superior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla superior, from* the outside. The superior maxillary bone is divided into the body and 4 processes, the nasal process, Processus nasalis seu frontalis, the malar or zygomatic process, Processus zygomaticus, the palatine process, Processus palatums, and the alveolar process, Processus alveolaris. The body has 3 surfaces: the external or facial surface, Superficies facialis, the superior or orbital surface, Superficies orbi- talis, and the internal or nasal surface, Superficies nasalis. The external surface is divided into an anterior or facial and a posterior or zygomatic portion; the anterior concave has at its upper border the infraorbital foramen, and below this the canine fossa, Fovea canina; the posterior convex is limited posteriorly by the maxillary tuberosity, Tuberositas maxillaris, on which are foramina, Foramina inaxillaria superiora, leading to vessel- and nerve canals (posterior dental canals). The orbital surface forms with its anterior border a part of the Margo infraorbitalis; the posterior border forms with the inferior border of the orbital surface of the great wing of the sphenoid the Fissura orbitalis inferior (spheno- maxillary fissure); from this a furrow, which changes in its course to a canal, the infraorbital canal, leads to the infraorbital foramen.22 Bones of the Face. 24. Right Superior Maxilla r)~ Bone, Maxilla superior, from the inner side. The nasal surface of the body shows the large opening of the antrum of Highmore; in front of this a semi-canal, the lachrymal groove, Sulcus lacrymalis. The outer surface of the nasal process of the superior maxilla (Fig. 23) is divided into an anterior and a posterior portion, by an elon- gation of the Margo infraorbital is; the posterior portion forms the Fossa sacci lacrymalis, which is continued into the Sulcus lacrymalis. The inner sur- face of the nasal process is transversely cut by a rough crest, the superior turbinated crest or Crista cthmoidalis (not constant); a thumb's breadth below this the inferior turbinated crest or Crista turbinalis, passes transversely across the surface, from the lower end of the Sulcus lacrymalis; between both crests lies the middle meatus, Meatus narium medius. The zygomatic process (Fig. 23) is a rough triangular eminence and serves for articulation with the malar bone.Bones of the Face. 23 25. Right Superior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla superior, from below. The palate process of the superior maxilla forms with that of the bone of the other side the anterior larger part of the h a r d palate; by the meeting of the inner borders of both palate processes the Crista nasalis (Fig. 24) is formed; this anteriorly passes into the anterior nasal spine, Spina nasalis anterior. Behind this lies the external orifice of the anterior or naso-palatine canal, Canalis naso-pala- tinus. Both naso-palatine canals converge and end at the under surface of the hard palate in the one Foramen incisivum seu palatinum anterius. The alveolar process contains 8 alveoli for the reception of the teeth; its outer' plate shows eminences, Juga alveolaria. The 8 teeth in these alveoli are: 2 incisor teeth, Denies incisivi; 1 canine tooth, Dens caninus; 2 bicuspid teeth (2 roots), Denies buccales; 3 molar teeth (3 roots) Denies molarcs, whose last is also called the wisdom tooth, Dens sapientiae.Bones of the Face. 24 26. Right Superior Maxillary 'Bone, Maxilla superior, from the outside, with the articulations of the bones and the insertion of the muscles. The inner and posterior border of the orbital surface of the body of the superior maxilla articulates with the lachrymal bone, the ethmoid bone (Lamina papyracea), and the palate bone. The nasal process articulates with the nasal portion of the frontal bone, its anterior border touches at its upper half the nasal bone, the lower concave half forms ,with the same border of the opposite superior maxilla the Apertura pyriformis narium; the posterior border articulates with the lachrymal bone. On the inner surface the crests serve for articu- lation with the middle and inferior turbinated bones. The malar process articulates with the malar bone.Bones of the Face. 25 27. Right Superior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla superior, from the inner side, with the articulations of the bones. The nasal or internal surface of the body of the superior maxilla shows the opening of the antrum of High more, which is partly closed by the ethmoid, the inferior turbinated and the palate bones; the outer border of the nasal surface articulates with the per- pendicular plate of the palate bone. The palatine process articulates at its inner border with the palatine process of the opposite superior maxilla; with the anterior half of the Crista nasalis the vomer articulates. The Processus alveolaris carries 8 teeth (Fig. 25). The superior maxilla therefore articulates with 9 bones: 2 cranial bones, the frontal and ethmoid, and 7 facial bones, the nasal, malar, lachrymal, palate, inferior turbinated, vomer and with the superior maxilla of the other side.

Body is that portion which articulates with the zygomatic process of the superior maxilla. (This part is also called maxillary process.) The surfaces are the facial (external), temporal (internal), and orbital. From the' orbital surface to the facial surface runs the Canalis zygomaticus facialis, with an accessory canal to the temporal surface. Behind this canal there is a second, leading from the orbital cavity into the tem- poral fossa, the Canalis zygomaticus temporalis, (These canals are also called temporo-malar canals.) The malar bone articulates with 4 bones: with 3 cranial bones, the frontal, sphenoid and temporal, and 1 bone of the face, the superior maxilla.27 Os nascrfe, from the outside.

The palate bone consists of 2 portions or plates placed at right angles to each other, the perpendicular plate, Pars perpendicular is, and the horizontal plate, Pars liorizontalis. The perpendicular plate shows on its inner surface 2 horizontal crests: the lower, the inferior turbinated crest, Crista turimalis, for articulation with the inferior turbinated bone; the upper, the superior turbinated crest, Crista ethmoidalis, for the Concha ethmoidalis inferior (middle turbinated bone). The p o s t e r i o r border shows the Sulcus pteri/go-pala- tinus, which forms with the similar sulcus on the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone and the groove at the posterior angle of the body of the superior maxilla the pterygo-palatine canal, Canalis pterygo-palatinus. The superior border has two processes, separated by an intervening notch, the Incisura spheno-palatina: the anterior process is the orbital pro- cess, Processus orbitalis (often containing some Cellula.e pahttinae); the posterior sphenoidal process, Processus sphenoidalis, when articulated with the sphenoid bone, forms the groove on the inferior surface of the body of the sjjhenoid into a canal, the Canalis splicno-palatiuus. The horizontal plate forms the back part of the hard palate, the inner border (articulated with the horizontal plate of the other palate bone) the Crista nasalis, which is extended posteriorly into the posterior nasal spine, Spina nasalis posterior. At the place where the perpendicular and horizontal plates blend, is the pterygoid or pyramidal process, Processus pyramidalis, which is inserted into the pterygoid notch of the sphenoid bone. The pterygo-palatine canal, formed together with the sphenoid and superior maxillary bones, divides inferiorly into 3 canals, which open into the 3 posterior palatine foramina in the hard palate.

Left Inferior Turbi- nated Bone, Concha inferior, from the inside. 37. Left Inferior Turbi- nated Bone, Concha inferior, from the outside. The inferior turbinated bone is situated at the inner wall of the body of the superior maxilla; its concave surface looks toward this wall, its convex surface toward the Sej)tnm narium. The lower mar- gin is rolled upon itself; at the upper margin arises the maxillary pro- cess, Processus maxillaris, which helps to make the opening of the antrum of Highmore smaller. In front of this process, the lachrymal process, Processus lacrymalis, is situated, partially forming the Canalis naso-lacrymalis. The ethmoidal process, Processus etltmotdalis, is not constant. The anterior and posterior ends of the bone come in contact with the inferior tur- binated crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The inferior turbinated bone articulates with 4 bones: 1 cranial bone, the ethmoid, and 3 of the face, the superior maxillary, palate and lachry- mal bones.31 Bones of the Face. 38. The Vomer, Os vomeris. The vomer serves for the formation of the inferior part of the bony Septum narium. The superior border is separated, forming 2 alae, the Alae vomeris, between which the rostrum of the sphenoid is received. The inferior border touches the Crista nasalis, formed by both superior maxillary and both palate bones. The anterior longest border articulates at its upper portion with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, at its lower with the quadrangular cartilage of the septum, Septum cartilagineum. The posterior shortest border is free and forms the septum of the posterior nares, which separates these from each other, forming the two choanae. The vomer articulates with 6 bones: 2 of the cranium, the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and 4 of the face, the 2 superior maxillary and the 2 palate hones; finally with the quadrangular cartilage of the septum, Cartilago quadrangu- laris s. Septum cartilagineum.32 Bones of the Face. 39. Inferior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla inferior, from the outside. The inferior maxilla is divided into the b o d y and 2 r a m i.

The Nasal Fossa, Cavum narium. The nasal fossa is divided into the nasal fossa proper, and the sinuses (Sinus frontalis, sphenoidalis, maxillaris). Superiorly the nasal fossa proper is bounded by the nasal bones and the Lamina cribrosa of the ethmoid bone; inferiorly by the palate process of the superior maxilla and the Partes horizontals of the palate bones. The lateral walls are formed above by the nasal process of the superior maxilla, the lachrymal bone, the Lamina papyracea of the ethmoid bone; further down by the internal or nasal surface of the superior maxilla (Superfic. nasal, max. svp.) the Pars perpendicular is of the palate bone, and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid (Proc. pterygoid, oss. sphenoid.). The anterior wall is formed by the nasal bones; a large part of it is lacking; in its place is the Aper- tura pyriformis. The posterior wall is formed partly by the anterior sur- face of the body of the sphenoid (Corpus oss. sphenoid.), below this are two openings, the Ghoanae (posterior nai-es). Each choana is limited above by the body of the sphenoid bone, externally by its pterygoid process (Proc. pteryg. oss. spjhenoid.), internally by the vomer and inferiorly by the Pars liorkontalis of the palate bone.43 Nasal Fossa. Sjiina nag. snj>. Spina lias, miter 53. The Nasal Fossa, Cavum narium. The nasal fossa is divided by the bony septum of the nose, Septum narium osseum, into two halves; this septum consists of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (Lamina perpendicular, oss. ethmoid.) and the vomer, and runs from the Lamina crihrosa and Spina nasalis superior to the Crista nasalis inferior. The bony parts of the ethmoidal labyrinth, the Concha ethmoidalis superior (superior turbinated bone), Concha cthmoidalis inferior (middle turbinated bone) and the inferior turbinated bone (Fig. 52) form bony prominences on the walls of the nasal fossa. Between the turbinated bones are the meatuses, Meatus narium, three on each side, viz: the superior, between the superior and middle tur- binated bones ; the m i d d 1 e, between the middle and inferior turbinated bones; the inferior, between the inferior turbinated bone and floor of the nasal fossa.

The Sacral Bone, Os sacrum, anterior view. The sacrum consists of 5 vertebrae united with each other; it has a base, an anterior and a posterior surface and 2 lateral borders. The base is articulated with the V. lumbar vertebra. The anterior surface is concave, and has 4 pairs of foramina, Foramina sacralia anteriora; each pair is connected by a horizontal ridge; external to these are the lateral masses, Massae laterales ossis sacri. The lateral borders which are articulated at their upper parts with the Ossa innominata, approach each other inferiorly, and form the apex below; this serves for articulation with the coccyx; near this apex the lateral borders present a semilunar notch, Incisura sacro-coccygea.54 Bones of the Trunk.

Behind the base is the triangular opening of the sacral canal, CandLis sacralis, which pierces the sacrum and is a continuation of the Canalis vertebralis; on both sides of it the superior articular processes of the first sacral vertebra project. The posterior surface is convex; along it runs the Crista sacralis media; on both sides are the Cristae sacral'es lateralcs. At the lower end of the Crista sacralis media is the inferior opening of the sacral canal, the Hiatus sacralis; at the sides of it are the Cornua sacralid, indistinct descending articular processes of the fifth sacral vertebra.

The Ligamentum longitudinale anterius is attached above to the basilar portion of the occipital bone, is at first narrow (Fig. 77), but soon becomes broader, runs along the anterior surface of the vertebral column, and is lost below in the periosteum of the sacrum. The weaker Ligamentum longitudinale posterius runs along the posterior surface of the vertebral bodies, within the spinal canal from the axis to the sacrum; it becomes somewhat broader at each intervertebral disc.57 Ligaments of the Spine. 74. The Intervertebral Substance, Fibro-cartilago intervertebral is. Each intervertebral disc consists of a broad fibrous ring, which contains in its center a softer substance rising up somewhat on section. With the fibrous ring the Ligamentum longitudindle anterius and posterim are closely connected. The Ligamenta subflaua consist of elastic fibres and are attached each between the laminae of 2 vertebrae, so that they run from the lower margin of the lamina above to the posterior surface of the lamina below. The ascending and descending articular processes of the vertebrae form articulations, Articulationes 2^'ocessuwn articularium, which are surroun- ded by capsular ligaments. 75.

The Ligaments between the Axis, Atlas and Occipital Bone, seen from the vertebral canal. The strong transverse ligament, Ligamentum transversum atlantis, presses the odontoid process of the axis toward the articular surface of the anterior arch of the atlas. From the upper border of this ligament .a ligamentous crus goes to the anterior border of the Foramen occipitale magnum, and a similar crus from its lower border to the body of the axis; the vertical crura form with the Ligamentum trans- versum the crucial ligament, Ligamentum cruciatum. The odontoid process is fixed at the anterior border of the Foramen magnum, by three ligaments, of which the middle is called Ligamentum susijensorium, the two lateral Ligamenta alaria. In the figure the capsular ligaments of the occipito-atloid articulations are also shown. The upper vertical crus of the crucial ligament is drawn somewhat aside, to show the Ligamentum suspensorium.Ligaments of the Spine. 62 SO. The Ligaments between the Atlas and Axis, superior view. By the Ligamentum transversum atlantis which arches across the odon- toid process (Dens) of the axis the opening of the atlas is divided into an anterior smaller and a posterior larger space; the former is for the odontoid process of the axis, the latter for the spinal cord. Between the anterior surface of the odontoid process and the articular facet of the anterior arch of the atlas, also between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and the Ligamentum transversum arching across it, are synovial capsules. SI. The Ligamentum sitspensorium dentis and the Liga- menta alaria, after opening of the anterior arch of the Atlas. The Ligamentum suspensorium dentis runs from the summit of the odon- toid process to the anterior border of the Foramen magnum; the Ligamenta alaria run from both sides of the summit of the odontoid process to the lateral bordeis of the Foramen magnum and to the inner surface of the condyloid processes.63 Ligaments of the Spine. 82. Ligaments between Axis, Atlas and Occipital Bone. The ligaments between the axis, atlas and occipital hone are covered in the Canalis medullar spinalis by a fibrous membrane, which arises above the anterior border of the Foramen occipitale magnum and ends at the lower border of the body of the axis, close to the commence- ment of the Ligamentum longitudinak posterius.

Between the apex of the sacrum and the first piece of the coccyx there is a disc of fibro-cartilage; also between the separate pieces of the coccyx. The strenghtening ligaments are the anterior, posterior and lateral Ligamenta sacro-coccygea. The Ligamentum sacro-coccygcum posttrius lies between the sacrum and cornua of the coccyx and closes the Hiatus sacro-coccygeus.84. The Vertebral Column, Columna vertebralis, side view. The vertebral column presents the fol- lowing curves: in the cervical portion a tolerably marked convexity anteriorly; in the dorsal region a well marked convexity posteriorly; in the lumbar region a well marked convexity anteriorly, and in the sacral and coccygeal portions a convexity posteriorly. The most marked, anterior convex curve, is at the place where the lumbar portion of the vertebral column joins with the sacrum, where the last lumbar vertebra forms the promontory, Promontorium.

The Sternum is divided into the Manubrium, Corpus or Gladiolus, and the e n s i f o r m or x ip h o i d a p p e n d i x , Processus xyplioideus. The superior border of the Manubrium presents in its center the interclavicular notch or Incisura semilunaris, on both sides of wich are the articular facets for the sternal end of the clavicle; the inferior border is articulated with the Gladiolus. The Gladiolus is three times as long as the Manubrium ; the xiphoid appendix appears either curved, pointed, bifid or perforated by a round hole.67 Bones of the Trunk 87. The Sternum in Articulation with the Costal Cartilages. The Sternum is in articulation at its lateral borders with seven costal cartilages. Only the first costal cartilage is continuous with the Sternum; the others are articulated with the Sternum in synovial cavities; the articular facets become shallower and shallower from the second to the seventh costal cartilage, and the seventh is placed in a very small concavity at the point of union of the Gladiolus and xiphoid appendix. The ribs whose cartilages articulate with the Sternum are called true, Cosfae verae; those ribs whose cartilages articulate with each other, or those which end free, without any articulation are called false, Costac spuriae. True ribs are the upper seven pairs; false ribs the lower five pairs. 9*V 68 Bones of the Trunk. 88. The Bony Portion of a True Rib. Each rib consists of a bony portion and a costal cartilage; the bony portion has an external convex and an internal concave surface, a superior rounded border, and an inferior border containing a groove, Sulcus costalis, which deepens especially toward the vertebral extremity of the rib; the part where the outer edge of the groove is highest, is called Crista costae.69 Bones of the Trunk. 89. The Vertebral Extremity of a Rib, Extremitas vertebralis. The vertebral extremity has a head, Capitulum, covered with carti- lage, which shows on those ribs articulated with two vertebral articular surfaces, two facets separated by a ridge, the Crista capituli. The flattened portion of the ten upper ribs behind the head is called the neck, (Solium.70 Bones of the Trunk. 00. The First Rib, superior view. The first rib shows an upper and an under surface, an outer and an inner border. It has a round head, Capttuhim, with a single articular facet, when the first dorsal vertebra alone forms the articular fossa; when the articular fossa is formed by the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, the articular facet of the head is also a double one. At the inner border there is a tubercle, the Tuberculwm IAsfrancii, which is not always very well developed.Bones of the Trunk. 71 Titltemilum. 91. The Second Rib, superior view. At the place where the neck, Collwm, is continued into the shaft, there is on every rib the tuberosity or tubercle, Tuberculum costae, covered with cartilage, for articulation with the articular surface of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae with which the rib is connected. At the back jDart of the external surface is a rough line, the angle, Angulus costae (Fig. 89); it is well developed only from the third to the tenth ribs, but coincides with the tubercle in the first and second ribs. The second rib has at its external surface a rough prominence for the attachment of the serratus magnus muscle, M. serratus aiiticus major.72 Bones of the Trunk 92. The Eleventh and Twelfth Ribs, Costae fiuctuantes. The eleventh and twelfth ribs end free and are of all the ribs the two most moveable; they have a round head with a single articular "facet.

AVhen the head of the rib has two articular facets (second to tenth ribs), the articular cavity is divided by the Ligamentum interartieidare (continuation of the intervertebral disc to the Crista eapituli) into two parts. The articular cavity of the eleventh and twelfth ribs is always single, that of the first rib usually single; sometimes, when the articular fossa is formed by the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, double, divided by a Ligamentum interartieidare.

Between the tubercles of the ribs and the transverse processes of the vertebrae are the costo-transverse articulations, Articulationes costo- transverscdes; they are not present on the eleventh and twelfth ribs. These articulations are surrounded by thin capsules and strengthened by the following ligaments: by the Ltgamentum costo-transversale posterius (posterior costo-transverse), passing from the rough portion of the Tuberculum costae to the summit of the transverse process of the vertebra; by the Ligamenhim colli costae anterius (anterior costo-transverse, Fig. 93) passing between the transverse process and upper border of the neck of the rib; and the Ligamentum colli costae posterius (middle costo-transverse), placed between the transverse process and the posterior surface of the neck of the rib.75 Articulations of the Ribs. 95. Articulations between the Anterior Ends of the Ribs and the Sternum, Articulationes costo-sternales, anterior view. The articulations between the anterior ends of the ribs and the sternum are found from the second to the seventh ribs; the cartilage of the first rib is united directly to the Manubrium stcrni (articulation here extremely rare). Each of these articulations consists of a synovial capsule, which is covered on the anterior surface by fibrous bands, Li'ga- menta sterno-costalia radiata. 10*76 Articulations of the Ribs. 96.

The scapula has: an anterior, a posterior surface, an internal, external and superior border, an inferior, superior external and superior internal angle, finally two processes. The bone covers the posterior surface of the 2. to the 7.-8. ribs. The anterior surface is somewhat concave, and is marked by 8 — 5 ridges, Costae scapulares (for insertions of muscles). The shortest superior border has at its outer end the deep supra-scapular notch, Incisvra scapulae. At the superior external, thickened angle is the glenoid cavity, Cavi- tas glenoidalis, for the head of the humerus; the slightly depressed surface which surrounds the head, is called the neck, Collum.Bones of the Upper Extremity. 83 104. The Left Shoulder-Blade, Scapula, from behind. The posterior surface of the scapula is divided by the spine, Spina scapulae, into the supra- and infraspinous fossae, Fossa supra- et, infra- spinata. The spine is continued into the broad acromion process, which over- hangs the glenoid cavity, and is connected by an articular facet with the clavicle. The second process is the coracoid process, Processus coracoideus, which arises between the Incisura scapulae and Cavitas glenoidalis, over which latter it curves forwards and outwards. The scapula articulates with the clavicle and the humerus. 11*Sternoclavicular Articulation 84 105. The Stemo-Clavicular Articulation, Articulatio sterno-clavicularis. The fibrous capsule of this articulation is especially strong on the anterior surface; the strengthening band is known as the Ligamentum stcrno-claviculare; the articular cavity has interposed an inter articular fibro-cartilage, whose circumference is closely connected with the fibrous capsule. As strengthening ligaments serve: the Ldgamentum inter- claviculare passing between both clavicles, and the Ligamentum costo-clavi- cularc passing from the cartilage of the first rib to the under rough sur- face of the sternal end of the clavicle.Acromioclavicular Articulation. 85 106. The Right Acromio-Clavicular Articulation, Articulatio acromio-clavicularis. The fibrous capsule of this articulation is strengthened by the Liga- mentum acromio - claviculare; in the articular cavity there is an inter- articular f i b r o - c a r t i 1 a g e developed in different degrees. The clavicle is articulated with the coracoid process by the strong coraco - clavicular ligament, whose internal triangular portion is called conoid ligament, Ligamentum conicum, and its external quadrilateral portion, trapezoid ligament, Ligamentum trapezoides. Between the acromion and coracoid processes there is a fibrous band, the strong coraco-acromial ligament. The Incisura semilunaris (supra- scapular notch) at the superior border of the scapula is converted by a transverse ligament, Ligamentum transversum, into a foramen (for the passage of the suprascapular nerve).86 Bones of the Upper Extremity, 107. The Right Humerus, Os humeri, from before. The humerus forms at its upper extremity the head, Caput humeri, covered with cartilage; the furrow below it is called the anatomi- cal neck, Colhtm anatomicum, while the surgical neck, Cottum ckirwrgicum,-lies at the place of insertion of the M. teres major (Fig. 109). Below the furrow the lesser tuberosity, Tuberculum minus, projects forwards, while the greater tuberosity, Tuherculum majus, projects outwards, being external to the lesser; between both runs the bicipital groove, Sulcus intcrtubercularis (for the tendon of the long head of the M. biceps). From the tuberosities the Spina tuberculi majoris and the Spina tuberculi minoris run downwards. At the external surface of the shaft or middle p i e c e, which has 3 surfaces, there is a rough triangu- lar impression, Tuberositas (place of insertion of the M. dcltoides); at the upper third of the inner border is the Foramen iiutritium. At the lower extremity of the humerus are: the trochlea, and the capitellum, Emincntia capitdta, the former for articulation with the ulna, the latter for articulation with the radius.13ones of the Upper Extremity. 108. The Right Hu- merus, Os humeri, from behind.

The s h o u 1 d e r - j o i n t is surrounded by a lax fibrous capsule, which is strengthened by the coraco-humeral or accessory and glenoid ligaments. The articulation is free on all sides, only at the superior circumference it is protected by the eoraco-acromial ligament which is spread like a bridge between the acromion and coracoid processes. The fibrous capsule, which stretches from the circumference of the glenoid cavity of the scapula to the anatomical neck of the humerus, covers the bicipital groove between both tuberosities, thereby changing it into a canal. Heitzmaun, Atlas. I. 1-2Shoulder-Joint 111. The Shoulder-Joint, Articulatio humeri, in section. The margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula is deepened by the Limbus cartilaginous. The fibrous and the synovial capsule lining it, bulge outwards as in all articulations, at different places, corresponding to the position of the bones which constitute the articulation. In the bicipital groove, or rather canal, the tendon of the long head of the M. biceps runs; the tendon is surrounded up to its origin at the highest point of the Limbus cartilaginous by a duplieature of the synovial capsule; this sheath stretches down to the place of insertion of the M. pectofalis major (Fig. 109).Bones of the Upper Extremity 91 The s up er i o r e x- tremity of the ulna shows a deep excavation, the grea- ter sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sigmoiclea major, which is bounded above by the ole- cranon process (also called Processus anconacus), and below by the coronoid process. On the outer side of the latter is the lesser sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sig- moiclea minor, for articulation with the head of the radius ; below this is the tuberosity, Tuberositas ulnae (for the in- sertion of the M. brachialis anticus). The shaft lias three surfaces and three bor- ders, of which latter the one turned toward the radius is called the Crista ulnae. The inferior ex- tremity is called head, Capitulum: this has an ar- ticular facet, part of which is turned downwards, and part outwards to be received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius. From the back part of the bead the sty- loid process, Processus styloidtus ulnae projects. The ulna articulates with the humerus and the radius. 112. The Right Ulna, Ulna, from before. 113.

The upper extremity of the radius forms the head, Capituhtm radii, which has a somewhat depressed ar- ticular surface; the constricted portion below the head is the neck. Below the latter is the tuberosity, Tuberositas radii (for the insertion of the M. biceps). The three sided shaft turns its most marked bor- der, the Crista radii, toward the same border of the ulna. The broad lower ex- tremity has an articular surface inferiorly, and a second smaller, semilunar ar- ticular surface, the sigmoid cavity of the radius or Inci- sure!, semilunaris radii, at the inner side, where it articulates with the Capitvlum tdnae. From the external surface, the one opposite the sigmoid cavity, the styloid process, Pro- cessus styloideus radii, projects. The radius articulates with four bones: the humerus, the ulna, the scaphoid and semi- lunar bones.Ulna, from before, with the insertions of the muscles, and muscle-furrows. 110.

The three articulations which form the elbow-joint have a common fibrous capsule, which is inserted superiorly a little above the trochlea and radial head of the humerus, and runs down to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna; it is not directly attached to the radius, but to the annular or orbicular ligament, Ligarmntum annulare, which surrounds the head of the radius, and is attached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Of the two lateral ligaments only the internal is attached directly to the ulna, while the external is attached to the annular ligament.Elbow-Joint. 97 121. The Articular Surfaces of the Humerus consti- tutiug the Elbow-Joiut, seen from above. The trochlea serves for articulation with the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna; the radial head, Eminentia capitata, for articulation with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius. 122. The Articular Surfaces of the Radius and Ulna constituting the Elbow-Joint, seen from above. The greater sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sigmoidea major ulnae, receives the trochlea of the humerus; the ridge dividing this cavity into two halves corresponds to the furrow on the trochlea. The cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius, Cavitas glenoidalis capituli radii, glides along the Eminentia capitata of the humerus, in flexion and extension, as well as in pronation and supination.

The innominate bone is divided into: the ilium, Os ilei, the ischium, Os iscldi, and the pubes, Os pubis. The ilium shows on its external surface the Linea arcuata externa. The superior border or crest of the ilium, Crista ossis ilei, has an external, middle and internal lip; (Labium); the anterior and posterior borders are notched and each has two projections, Spinae; below the posterior inferior spine is a deep notch, the great sacro-sciatic, Tncisura ischiadica major. The ischium has a body, a descending and an ascending- ramus; the spine of the ischium, Spina ossis ischii, limits the great sacro-sciatic notch interiorly. The descending ramus ends with the t ub er osit y, Tuberositas, ossis iscliii, between which and the spine of the ischium is the lesser sacro-sciatic notch, lncisura ischiadica minor. The ascending ramus ascends from the tuberosity upwards and inwards.110 Bones of the Lower Extremity. 151. The Right Hip Bone, Os innominatum, inner surface.

The upper e x t r e m i t y of the femur consists of a head, Caput femoris, which is connected to the shaft by means of a neck, and has a small depression, Foveola, for the insertion of the Lag. teres. At the place where the neck is continued into the shaft, are the two trochanters, the great external, Trochanter major, and the lesser inter- nal, Trochanter minor; these are connected by the two inter- trochanteric lines, the Linea im.tertrochante.rica anterior and pos- terior. At the internal surface of the great trochanter lies the digi- tal or trochanteric fossa, Fossa trochanterica (Fig. 166). The Linea asptra femoris ("Fig. 166) extends along the posterior surface of the shaft; it presents two lips, Labia. The lower extremity presents two condyles, Condy- lus externus and Conclylus interims, each of which has a tuberosity. The condyles are separated posteriorly by the intercondyloid notch or Fossa poplitca (Fig. 166). The femur articulates with three bones: the Os innominatum, tibia and patella.Hip-Joint. 121 108.

The convex thickened border of each semilunar cartilage is turned toward the capsule, the concave thinned border toward the Eminentia intercondyloidea of the tuberosities of the tibia. The internal semilunar fibro-cartilage is less curved, and at its convex border thicker than the external (Fig. 178); the anterior extremities of these carti- lages are connected by means of a transverse ligament; these extremities are inserted in front, the posterior behind the Eminentia intercondyloidea.128 Knee-joint. 178. The Crucial Ligaments, Ligamenta cruciata, of the Eight Knee-Joint. The crucial ligaments pass from the rough inner surfaces of the condyles of the femur to the spaces in front of and behind the spine of the tibia. The anterior or external crucial ligament, Lhjamentum cruciaivm antcrius, passes from the inner surface of the external condyle to the depression in front of the spine of the tibia; the posterior or internal crucial ligame n t, Ligamcntum cruciatum posterius, from the outer surface of the internal condyle to the dejjressioii behind the spine of the tibia.129 Knee-joint. 179. The External Lateral Ligament, Ligamentum laterale externum, of the Right Knee-Joint The rounded external lateral ligament passes from the tuberosity on the external condyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. It lies out- side of the thin fibrous capsule, which is strengthened by fibrous expansions on the posterior and external surface of the joint. The stronger band of fibres lying in the popliteal space is described as popliteal liga- ment, Ligamentum popliteum, those fibres lying externally as short external lateral ligament, IAgamentwm laterale externum breve. The relation of these fibres with the muscle insertions is seen in the drawing. Heitzmann, Atlas.

In the figure the fibrous capsule, which is very thin toward the inner side, its relation to the tendon of the quadriceps extensor muscle, its origin above the condyles of the femur, and its insertion at the rough margin of the condyles of the tibia, are represented.Knee-Joint. 131 181. The Alar Ligaments, Ligamenta alarm, of the Right Knee-Joint. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint sends off, on each side of the patella, two folds (Ligamenta alaria), which are well supplied with fat, and end in a thin ligamentous band, which runs from the place of insertion of the anterior crucial ligament to the intercondylar fossa of the femur — Ligamentum mucosum. The alar ligaments divide (after Hyrtl] the space in front of the crucial ligaments into three entirely separate ligamentous cavities.132 Knee-Joint. 182.

The articular surfaces of the cuboid bone are: a posterior for articulation with the Os calcis; an internal for the external cunei- form bone; two anterior for the bases of the fourth and fifth meta- tarsal bones. Sometimes a fifth very small articular facet is present on the internal surface of the bone, for articulation with the scaphoid bone.Ankle-joint. 192. The Right Ankle-Joint, Articulatio pedis, from before, after removal of the anterior capsular wall. 193. The Articular Surfaces of the Right Tibia and Fibula, constituting the Ankle-Joint, seen from above.. On account of the size of the articular surface on the body of the astra- galus , a part of the anterior and posterior articular surfaces of that bone is, even in the median position of the joint, between flexion and extension, free from contact with the articular surface of the tibia. The tibia and fibula are articulated below by means of the anterior and posterior tibio-fibular ligaments, IAgamentum tibio-fibular-e anterius and posterius; between these are sac-like diverticula of the synovial membrane of the ankle-joint.

For all sections the following will serve as an explanation: The sections were made with the saw on hard frozen cadavers, and the drawings taken in 2/3 the natural size, after the sawn surface was washed with water, and slightly thawed. For all horizontal sections the right extremity was chosen, and the drawings made from the lower cut surface; we therefore see the sections as if on a person standing with his right side towards us, in bird's eye view. By a horizontal section is meant one which falls vertically on the long axis of the body (the extremity); by a frontal section one which divides the body (the extremity) into an anterior and a posterior half; by a sagittal section one, which runs parallel with the median plane, therefore divides the body (the extremity) into a right and left, or external and internal half.

Below the nasal bones are the two t r i a n g u- lar cartilages, Cartilagines triangulares (upper lateral cartilages, Fig. 2 91), and in the upper half of the wings of the nose, the two alar carti- lages, Cartilagines alares (lower lateral cartilages, Fig. 291); between these and the margin of the Incisura pyriformis are the sesamoid cartilages, Cartilagines sesamoideae seu minores. The nasal cavity is lined by the pituitary or Schnei dorian membrane, Membrana pituitaria narium, which is continuous with the skin through the nostrils, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx through the posterior nares, Choanae. In the upper or olfactory region of the mucous membrane, Begio olfactoria, the filaments of the olfactory nerve are distributed, and in this portion the sense of smell is lodged. In the lower or respiratory region, Regio respiratorhi, the filaments of the nasal bran- ches of the Nervus trigeminus ramify, and in this part the sense of touch only is lodged (Fig. 293).289.

The Eye and the Muscles of the Eyelid. The eyelids, Palpebrae, are moveable portions of integument, whose free margins limit the JRima palpebrarum; this latter ends in an acute outer angle, Canthus externus, and a rounded inner angle, Canthus interims. The eyelashes, Cilia, are attached to the free edges of each eyelid. The tarsi, Tarsus superior and Tarsus inferior, are placed in the mucous membrane of the eyelids, and are attached to the upper and lower margins of the orbit by the strong Ligamenta tarsi superioris et inferioris; the thick Ligamentum canthi internum runs from the inner canthus to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and the broad Ligamentum canthi externum from the outer canthus to the frontal process of the malar bone. The ciliary muscle, M. ciliaris, lies upon the tarsus. Upon the posterior surface of the tarsal cartilages, or surrounded by them, are the sebaceous Meibomian glands (30—40 in the upper lid, 25—35 in the lower), whose ducts open on the posterior part of the free margin of the lids, and secrete the Sebum palpebrale seu Lema (Fig. 295, 296). The eyebrows, Supercilia, are the arched eminences of integu- ment, along the upper circumferences of the orbits, which support numerous short, thick hairs.Organ of Vision. 219 The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane, which, as continuation of the Integumentum commune covers the posterior surface of the eyelids, where it is called Conjunctiva palpebrarum, is reflec- ted from the lid ou to the globe of the eye, which portion is named Fornix conjunc- tivae, and then sur- rounds the anterior surface of the eyeball, being there called Con- iunctiva bulbi. Upon the sclerotic coat, the conjunctiva changes its character, becoming thinner and loosely connectedtothe globe; upon the cornea it is extremely thin and closely adherent. At the inner angle of the eyelid the con- junctiva forms a semi- lunar f old, Plica semi- Iwtoaris, at the anterior side of which is a small, reddish body, the Carun- cula lacrymalis. Mouths of t.

In each orbit are two compound racemose lachrymal glands, Glandulae lacrymales, not entirely distinct from each other; the larger, Glandula innominata Galeni, lies in the lachrymal fossa of the external angular process of the frontal bone; the smaller, Glandula lacrymalis accessoria Monroi, in front of and below it. The ten fine excretory ducts open at the Fornix conjunctivae. The tears, which, in the fornices are conveyed inwards, collect in the sinus between Plica semilunaris and Caruncula lacrymalis, in the Lacus lacrymarurn; from here they find their way into the Puncta lacry- malia, the minute orifices of the lachrymal canals; then into the Canaliculi lacrymales; thence into the lachrymal sac, Saccns lacrymalis s. Dacryocystis, which is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lachrymal and superior maxillary bones. The lachrymal sac leads into the membranous nasal d u c t, Ductus naso-lachrymalis, which opens into the inferior meatus, at the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, covered by the inferior turbinated bone (see Fig. 291). In the orbit are seven muscles; six move the eyeball, one the upper eyelid. M. levator palpcbrae svperioris arises from the upper surface of the sheath of the optic nerve, and is inserted below the upper border of the orbit into the superior tarsal cartilage.Organ of Vision. 221 298. The Muscles of the Eye, from the outside. M. rectus interims, M. rectus externus, M. rectus superior, M. rectus inferior arise in the vicinity of the sheath of the optic nerve, run forwards, and are inserted by tendinous expansions at a distance of from 2 to 3 lines from the margin of the cornea into the sclerotica. The M. rectus externus arises by two heads. M. obliquus superior s. M. trochlearis is placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit; its tendon passes through a fibro- cartilaginous ring or pulley, Trochlea, which is attached to the trochlear fossa, s. Hamulus trochlearis of the frontal bone, and passing outwards and backwards is inser- ted into the sclerotic coat. M. obliquus inferior arises at the inner end of the lower margin of the orbit; it passes outwards, upwards and backwards and is inserted into the sclerotic coat.222 Organ of Vision. 300. Horizontal Section through both Eyeballs. After Ferdinand Arlt sen. The eyeball, Bulbus oculi, consists of three concentric coats; these coats are: a) the white sclerotic coat, Sclerotica s. Sclera, and the transparent Cornea; b) the choroid, Chorioidea, and the Iris; c) the Retina. The cavity of the eyeball is filled out by the aqueous h u m o r, Humor aqueus, the crystaline lens, Lens crystallina, and the vitreous body, Corpus vitreum. The sclerotica is an opaque, fibrous coat, whose most anterior segment is joined with the cornea, and whose posterior part is pierced for the passage of the optic nerve; this perforation is not in the axis of the eye, but about a line internal to it. At the point where the optic nerve passes through the sclerotica, this membrane forms a thin, cribriform lamina, Lamina cribrosa. The inner surface of the sclerotic is covered with delicate pigmented bundles of connective tissue, the Lamina fusca. The cornea projects forwards beyond the sclerotic; it is nearly circular, but a little broader in the transverse direction; the anterior surface is encroached upon by the sclerotic. Near the junction of the sclerotic and cornea is a venous, cavernous sinus, the canal of Schlemm (see Fig. 302, 303). The substance of the cornea consists of transparent connective tissue bundles, which cross one another at right angles in the alternate layers; the epithelium which covers the front of the cornea, con- sists of several layers of epithelial cells; beneath this is the structure- less anterior elastic lamina of Bowman; the posterior surface consists of a single layer of epithelial cells, above which is the Membrana Dcscemctii,223 Organ of Vision. 301. Section of the Eyeball. Magn. = 4. After Ferdinand Arlt sen. The choroid and iris form the second layer of the eyeball. The former lies on the inner surface of the sclerotic; its outer pigmented connective tissue layer is similar to the Lamina fusca of the sclerotic; the middle layer of the choroid is formed by the bloodvessels, whose net- work of capillaries was called Lamina Buyschii; the inner surface, which is smooth, is covered by the hexagonal pigmented cells of the retina — Tapetum nigrum. At the anterior margin of the sclerotic, the choroid becomes thickened, forming the Corpus ciliare. The superficial layer of the ciliary body is the Musculus ciliaris s. Tensor chorioideae (see Fig. 303), (meridional and radiating fibres); the deep layer, the Corona ciliaris, a circle of from 70—85 folds, each of which is called ciliary process, Processus ciliaris. The indented border between the folded and smooth part of the choroid is the Ora serrata.224 Organ of Vision. 302. Diagram of the Bloodvessels of the Eyeball. Magh. = 4. After T li e o d o i- Leber. The iris consists of muscular and connective tissue, besides numerous vessels and nerves; its inner edge, Margo papillaris, forms the margin of the pupil, Piipilla; between it and the cornea is the anterior cham- ber of the eye, between it and the lense the posterior chamber; both chambers are filled with the aqueous humor. The outer margin of the iris, Margo ciliaris, is a direct continuation of the Corpus ciliare and is connected with the Membrana Dcscemetii hy means of the Ligamen- tum pectinatum (see Fig. 303). The structure of the iris is seen from Fig. 303; of its muscles the circular fibres, Sphincter pypittae, surround the margin of the pupil, while the radiating fibres, Dilatator pupillae, arise from the margin of the cornea.Organ of Vision 225 303.

The choroid is supplied with blood by three or four short ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliares posticae breves, the iris' and the ciliary muscle by the two long ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliares posti- cae longae and the anterior ciliary, Arteriae ciliares anticae, whose number differs (all are branches of the ophthal- mic artery). The veins, Yasa vorticosa, four or five in num- ber, developed from the capil- laries, pierce the sclerotic about half way between the cornea and jilace of entrance of the optic nerve. The blood also flows through the Venae ciliares anticae et posticae. The iris, choroid and ciliary muscle are supplied by the ciliary nerves, which, ten to sixteen in number, pierce the sclerotic at its pos- terior portion ; also by fibres from the Nervus sympathicus.

The retina, expansion of the optic nerve, is the innermost layer of the eye- ball, the real organ of vision. The place where the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats, is marked by an eminence, the Colli- culus sen Papilla nervi optici; here the bloodvessels, Art. and Vena centralis retinae, find their entrance and exit. At the point of entrance of the optic nerve the power of vision is absent (blind spot), and this part lies a little to the inner side of the point of most perfect vision. This latter point has a slight central depression, Fovea centralis; in the eye of the cadaver it is seen as a yellow spot, Macula hdea, and only there it is connec- ted by two eminences, Plicae centrales, with the papilla. The layers of the retina (see Fig. 307) are distinct up to the region of the Ora serrata; from here on only the struc- tureless Memhrana limitans, lying between the layer of rods and cones andinnermost layer of the choroid, remains. The vitreous body, Corpus vitreum, occupies the greater portion of the eyeball; it is covered by a thin glassy membrane, the Hyaloidea, which, in front, where it pas- ses forwards to the margin of the crystaline lens, is known as the Zonula Zinnii. Between the anterior and posterior fibres of the zonula is the Canalis Petit/' (see Fig. 301).227 29*Organ of Hearing. 228 308. The Auricle, Auricula. 309. The Muscles of the Auricle. Tbe pinna or auricle is formed by a layer of fibro-carti- lage; its external rim is called the helix, which commences as Spina helicis; to the inner side of the helix is the fossa of the helix or Fossa scaphoidea; inter- nal to that, the curved antihelix, the commencement of which is formed by two ridges, the Crura furcata. The deepest concavity of the pinna, surrounding the entrance to the external auditory meatus is called concha. In front of the concha, and projecting back- wards over the meatus is the t r a- gus; opposite it the an ti tra- gus; between both is a deep notch, the Incisura intertragica. Below the notch is the lobule, Lobulus auriculae, devoid of the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. The muscles of the auricle are: the M. attollens (levator) auri- culae, the M. attrahens auriculae and the MM. retrahentes auriculae. Between the projections of the car- tilage of the ear are: the M. helicis major, which arises from the Spina helicis, and is inserted into the an- terior border of the helix where it is about to curve backwards; the M. Jielicis minor at the commencement of the Spina helicis; the M. tragi- cus upon the anterior surface of the tragus; iheM. antitragicus from the lower end of the antihelix to the antitragus. The M. transversus auriculae lies at the convex posterior surface of the cartilage of the ear, between the tubercles of the concha and the fossa of the helix.Organ of Hearing. 229 The external au- ditory canal consists of a cartilaginous portion, Meatus audi- torium cartilagineus, which is a prolongation of the cartilage of the ear, and through which several shallow fissures, Incisu- rae Santorinianae, extend transversely; and of a bony portion, Meatus auditorius osscus, which is part of the temporal bone. At the inner end of the latter is a groove for the insertion of the Membrana tympani, Sul- cus pro membrana tympani. — The skin of the exter- nal meatus is continuous with that covering the pinna, and possesses fine hairs — Hirci; in the thick subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous por- tion of the meatus are small oval glands, similar to the sweat glands, Glandidae ceruminales, which secrete the ear w a x, Cerumen. 310.

The Membrana tympani is situated between the external meatus and cavity of the tympanum, and is directed ob- liquely inwards and downwards ; its external surface appears concave, its internal surface connex, and its form is oval. The most depressed part of the outer surface, corresponding to the end of the handle of the malleus, is called Umbo. At the upper and anterior part the short p r o c e s s of the mal- leus projects; the handle of the malleus is visible in its entire length; exceptionally also the long pro- cess of the incus. The Membrana tympani is composed of three layers: the external is derived from the integument lining the meatus; the middle consists of fibrous and elastic tissues; the internal is the mucous membrane. 313.

The tympanic cavity, Cavum tympani, lies to the inner side of the Membrana tympani, is lined by mucous membrane, and communicates by means of the Eustachian tube with the pharynx. At the inner wall of it are: the Fenestra ovalis, leading into the vestibule of the labyrinth; the Fenestra rotunda, into the cochlea (closed by a thin mem- brane, Membrana tympani secundaria); between both fenestrae, the pro- montory, Promontorium, marked by a groove, Sulcus Jacobsonii; behind the Fenestra ovalis the hollow pyramid, Eminentia pyrarnidalis, whose summit projects forwards towards the Fenestra ovalis; above the Fenestra ovalis the lower wall of the Canalis Fallopiae; above the promontory the Semi- canalis tensoris tympani, ending with the conical Rostrum cochleare.Organ of Hearing. 232 316.

The Eustachian tube, Tuba Eustachii, commences at the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, below the Semicanalis tensoris tympani with the Ostium tympanicum, runs obliquely forwards, inwards and downwards, and terminates at the side of the pharynx, with the Ostium pharyngeum. The tube consists of an osseous and a cartilaginous portion. The small bones of the ear, Ossicula auditus, are three in number : The Malleus, or hammer bone, is divided into a head, neck, handle, short and long process. The handle or Manubrium is connected with the Membrana tympani; the short process, Processus brevis, is situated at the root of the handle and projects outwards toward the Membrana tympani; the long process, Processus Folii seu gracilis lies in the Fissura Glaseri.233 Organ of Hearing. 317.

The short process is articulated with the posterior wall of the tympanum by means of ligamentous fibres; the long process is bent inwards at its extremity and terminates in a rounded projection, the lenti- cular process or Ossiculum lent/'cularc Sylvzi. With the latter the head of the stapes articulates. c) The stapes or stirrup consists of a head, from which diverge the two curved crura; these are connected at their extremities by the base, which fits into the Fenestra ovalis, and the space between them is filled out by a membrane, the Membrana propria stapedis. The muscles w h i c h move the Ossicula auditus are: the M. ten- sor tympani, which heightens the tension of the Membrana tympani, and arises from the Eustachian tube and under surface of the petrous bone; it lies in the Semicanalis, its tendon bends around the Rostrum coch- leare, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus. — M. laxator tympani, which relaxes the Membrana tympani, arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and, passing through the Glaserian fissure is inserted into the long process of the malleus. — M. stapedius, the muscle of the stirrup (Fig. 314) lies in the hollow of the Eminentia pyramidalis: its tendon emerges from the orifice at the apex of the pyramid, and is inserted into the head of the stapes.

Magn. = 3- The internal ear, the labyrinth, consists of the vestibule, Vestibulum, the three semicircular canals, Canales semicircu- lares, and the Cochlea. The vestibule is the central cavity of communi- cation between the semi- circular canals and the cochlea. Its boundaries are : Externally the tym- panic cavity (the Fene- stra ovalis, by means of which the tympanum and vestibule communciate, is closed by the base of the stapes); internally the internal auditory meatus; anteriorly the cochlea; posteriorly the semicir- cular canals; superi- orly the commencement of the Fallopian canal (Fig. 327). The anterior portion is called Recessus hemispluxericus; the posterior Recessus hemiellipticus; be- tween both is the Crista vesti- buli, which ends superiorly with the Pyramis vestibuli. The three semicircular ca- nals open into the Recessus hemiellipticus by five orifices, two canals at the inner wall of the vestibule having one common orifice; in front of the latter is the orifice of the Aquae- ductus vestibuli. The Scala vestibuli of the cochlea opens into the Recessus hcmisphaericus. The three Maculae cribrosae are seen in Fig. 321. ull/3 320. The Osseous Labyrinth laid open from before. Magn. = 3-Organ of Hearing. 235 The three semicircular canals are: a superior, an inferior or posterior and an external; each stands at right angles to the other two. There are three orifices at one extremity, which are dilated, the enlargement being known as ampulla, but only two orifices at the opposite extremity, the superior and posterior canals joining together and opening by a common aperture. The exter- nal canal is the shortest, the posterior thelongest. The cochlea consists of a canal wound spirally around a central axis for 2*/2 turns; this central axis is called, for the first turn, Modiolus, for the second Columella, and for the uppermost half turn Lamina modioli. The apex of the cochlea is directed for- wards towards the inner wall of the tympanum, its base is turned towards the internal auditory meatus. — The spiral canal terminates in a cul-de- sac, the Cupula; here the Scy- plius Vieussenii or infundibu- lum of the cochlea is formed (Fig. 320). 321.

The spiral canjil is divided by the bony spiral lamina, Lamina spiralis ossea, which projects into it from the modiolus, into two passages; of these, the lower, Scala tympani, communicates with the tymjianum by means of the Fenestra rotunda, while the u p p e r, Scala vestibuU, opens into the Heccssus licmispliaericus vestibuU (Fig. 320). In the Scala tympani, behind the Fenestra rotunda, is the orifice of a small canal, the Aquacductus ad cocMcam. The osseous spiral lamina ends at the last half turn in a hook- like process, Hamulus, turned towards the Scyphus (Fig. 320); it reaches only about half way towards the outer wall of the spiral canal; the two Scalac are closed by means of a membrane, the Lamina spiralis mcmbranacca. Between the two layers of this membrane is a canal, the Scala media s. canalis cochleae; upon that layer which lies in the plane of the osseous sj^iral lamina, usually called the Membrana basi/aris, the Organ of Corti lies. The Lamina spiralis mcmbranacca reaches in the cupola of the cochlea beyond the Hamulus and surrounds an opening, Helicotrema Brescheti, by means of which Scala vestibuU and Scala tympani communicate with each other.Organ of Hearing. 237 Otoliths *■ *oust! 325. The Membranous Labyrinth. (Diagrammatic.) The membranous laby- rinth consists of two mem- branous sacs, the Sacculus sphaeri- cus or saccule (lying in the Eeces- sus hemisphaericus vestibvli) and the Sacculus cllipticus or utricle (lying- in the Recessus hemiellipticus), in which latter, the m e m b r a nous semicircular canals, cor- responding to the bony, and also containing ampullae, open. Bet- ween the sacs, which do not com- municate with each other, and the inner surface of the bony labyrinth lined by a thin periosteal mem- brane, is a fluid, the Ptrilyrrvpha; the membranous semicircular ca- nals do not entirely fill out the bony, in which they are lodged, but lie only on the convex side of the latter. The sacs and mem- branous semicircular ca- nals also contain a fluid, the Eiidolymplia. Corresponding to the three Maculae cribrosae and the Pyramis vestibvii (places of entrance of the N. acusticus) are rounded bodies consisting of minute crystal- line grains of carbonate of lime (otoliths). The Nervus vestibuli pas- ses through the foramina of the three Maculae cribrosae, and its fibres are distributed to the wall of the membranous labyrinth, not to its cavity. The internal auditory meatus, commencing at the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, ends by a blind pouch, being- separated from the vestibule by a thin bony plate. The blind pouch is divided by a bony ridge into an upper and a lower fossa. The upper has two depressions, the anterior leading to the Canalis Fallopiae, the posterior to the Macula cribrosa superior; the lower has the Tractus spiralis foraminulentus, behind this the openings to the Macula cribrosa media and a larger opening to the Macula cribrosa inferior.

The oral cavity is divided by the closed rows of teeth into the Yestibulum oris and the Cavum oris proper. The anterior opening forms the Mima oris, bounded by the lips, Labia, which are connected at their inner surfaces to the gums, Gingivae, by folds of mucous membrane, the Fraenulum labii superior is et inferior is. The lips and inner part of the oral cavity are lined by mucous membrane, which becomes continuous with the tongue, on both sides, and on the under surface from the Fraenulum linguae, and which sepa- rates the mouth from the pharynx at the border of the hard palate, by means of a pendent fold, the soft palate, Palatum nolle. The soft palate (Velum pendulum palati) constitutes a moveable partition between the mouth and pharynx, directed obliquely downwards and backwards; hanging from the middle of its lower free border is the Uvvla, and arching outwards and downwards from the base of the uvula on each side are the arches or pillars of the soft palate, Arcus palatini, the anterior of which, running downwards, outwards and forwards to the tongue, is called Arcus palato-glossus, the posterior, downwards, out- wards and backwards to the sides of the pharynx, Arcus palato-pliaryngcus.Topography.

Amygdalae, which are conglomerates of follicular glands, lie in the triangular space between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. The space between the lower margin of the palatine arches, the base of the tongue and between both tonsils, leading from the mouth into the pharynx, is called isthmus of the fauces, Isthmus fauchim (see Fig. 330). The isthmus of the fauces changes in shajie; the muscles of the soft palate contract and expand, elevate and depress it; with each act of deglutition the soft palate is raised and made tense, the posterior pillars of the fauces brought together, thus forming a narrow slit, which is entirely closed by the uvula; this prevents the passage of food towards the upper part of the pharynx or the posterior nares.Soft Palate. 7 332, The Muscles of the Soft Palate; view from before. The M. azygos uvulae arises from the posterior nasal spine of the palate bone, Spina palatum, and descends in the middle line of the uvula to its apex. It consists of two slips, which lie close together. The MM. levatores veli palatini (M. petro-salpingo-staphylinus) arise from the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube on both sides; passing to the middle line of the uvula, they partly blend with the M. azygos, and partly with each other. The MM. tensores palati (M. spheno-salpingo-staphylinus) are flat muscles, which arise from the spine of the sphenoid and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and terminate in broad tendons which wind around the hamular process; they form together the broad aponeurosis of the soft palate.8 Soft Palate. 333. The Muscles of the Soft Palate; view from behind. The MM. palato-glossi occupy the anterior pillars of the fauces; they are narrow muscles, which, in the soft palate blend with each other, and by their contraction narrow the isthmus of the fauces; they are also called Constrictores isthmi faucium. The MM. palato-jpJia/ryngei occupy the posterior pillars of the fauces; they arise in the aponeurosis of the M. tensor pcdati, consisting of two layers and are inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and into the fibrous layer of the lower part of the pharynx, reaching as far as, or even crossing, the middle line behind.9 Teeth. 334. Incisor, Bicuspid and Molar Teeth, in section. That part of the teeth, Denies, which projects above the gums, is called body or crown, Corona; the part fixed in an alveolus of the upper or lower jaw, the root, Radix; between the crown and the root is the constricted portion, the neck, Collum, covered by the gums. Cor- responding to the crown and neck of the tooth, a hollow cavity, Cavum dentis, is found in its interior; this is continuous with a canal, Canalis radicis, which opens by a minute orifice at the extremity of the root. The cavity is occupied by a soft, highly vascular and sensitive substance, the dental pulp, Pulpa dentis. The tooth is composed of three substances: a) The enamel, Substantia adamantina s. vitrea, encrusts and pro- tects the crown; it is thickest on the grinding surface of the crown, and becoming gradually thinner, ends at the neck; it consists of hard and dense hexagonal fibres, which pursue a more or less wavy course. b) The ivory or dentine, Ebur s. Substantia propria, forms the body of the tooth; it consists of a structureless mass, which has numerous, very fine tubes, opening at their inner ends into the pulp cavity, and pursuing a wavy and undulating course towards the periphery. c) The cement, Crusta ostoides radicis, covers the external surface of the root, and has the structure of bone. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 2Teeth. 10 335. The Right Permanent Teeth, Denies permanentes. Each jaw has sixteen permanent teeth, namely: Four incisor teeth, Dentes incisivi, with chisel-shaped crowns and single conical roots. Two canine teeth, Denies angulares s. canini, with conical crowns, tapering to a blunted point or cusp (on the inner side of these are two facets) and single conical roots. Four bicuspid teeth, Dentes buccales; the crown is compressed antero-posteriorly, and surmounted by two pointed tubercles, an external and an internal; the roots bifid or single, compressed, and deeply grooved. Six molar teeth, Dentes molares; the grinding surfaces surmoun- ted by four or five tubercles; in the upper jaw the root consists of three fangs, of which two are external, and one internal; in the lower jaw it has two fangs, one placed in front, the other behind, each of which is grooved. The last molar or wisdom tooth, Dens serotinus, Dens sapientiae (so called on account of its late appearance, usually between 20 and 25 years), has a smaller crown, shorter and more converging- roots, which may also blend and form a single fang. The periods of eruption of the temporary and permanent teeth are evident from Fig. 338 a and 338b.11 Teeth. 336. The Rig lit Milk Teeth, Denies lactei s. caduci The eruption of the temporary or milk teeth commences in the sixth or seventh month after birth; at the end of the second year of life the child has twenty teeth, ten in each jaw, namely, four incisors, two canines, and four molars. In the seventh year the milk teeth begin to fall out and make room for the permanent set. 337. The Teeth of a Child with the Calcified Parts of the Permanent Teeth Exposed.

Welcker.Salivary Glands. 13 339. The Salivary Grands, Glandulae salivates. On each side there are three salivary glands, namely: The parotid gland, Glandula parotis, lying in front of and below the ear, fills out the angle between the ramus of the lower jaw, the mastoid process and the external auditory meatus, and extends over the anterior surface of the Masseter muscle. Its chief excretory duct, Stenson's duct, Ductus Stenonianus, runs forwards parallel to the zygomatic arch, pierces the buccinator muscle, and opens on the inner surface of the cheek, opposite the first or second upper molar tooth. Precpxently an iso- lated small Parotis accessoria lies upon Stenson's duct. The submaxillary gland, Glanclula submaxillar is, lies partly beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle in the triangular space between the lower border of the inferior maxilla and the digastric muscle (M. biventer maxillae). Its excretory duct, Wharton's duct, Ductus Wliartonianus, opens at the side of the Fraenulum linguae on the summit of a small papilla, Caruncula sublingualis.14 Salivary Glands. 340. Lobules of the Parotid Gland, natural size. After a specimen of 11 g. The sublingual gland, Glandula sublingualis, rests on the upper surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle; its excretory ducts (eight to twelve), Ductus Bivini, open behind the Caruncula sublingualis, or join to form a common duct, the Ductus Bartholin!, which blends with Wharton's duct, or opens separately at the caruncula. The salivary glands are compound racemose glands; a number of acini form a lobule, which has a very small excretory duct; the small ducts unite to form larger ones, these again form the chief excretory duct. The tongue, Lingua (Fig. 341), is a muscular organ situated in the floor of the mouth; it has an upper surface or dorsum, an under surface, two. lateral borders, an apex or tip, a body, and a base or root. The upper convex surface contains numerous gustatory papillae, which are found a3 far back as the region of the isthmus of the fauces; from here to the hyoid bone there are mucous and follicular glands. On the under surface, which has no papillae, the mucous membrane forms a fold, the Fraemdum linguae; at the sides the Arcus pcdato-glossi are attached. The base or root of the tongue is attached to the hyoid bone; from it a middle and two lateral folds of mucous membrane, the glosso-epiglottic folds, Ligamenta glosso-epiglottica medium ct lateralia, pass to the epiglottis. The tongue is divided into two halves, by a fibrous septum, the Septum medianum linguae (see Fig. 329); at the tip of the lingual muscle the acinous Glandula Nuhnii s. Blandini about the size of a bean (see Fig. 339) is imbedded; its excretory ducts open at the Crista fimbriata, a fold of mucous membrane, which runs obliquely backwards and outwards.15 Tongue. 341. Tlie Upper Surface of the Tongue. At the dorsum of the tongue are three kinds of papillae, Papillae gustatoriae (see Fig. 343): a) Conical or filiform papillae, Papillaefiliformes, are densely set over the greater part of the dorsum of the tongue, in parallel rows, which run obliquely from the middle line forwards and outwards; they have a thick epithelial covering, and contain a number of elastic fibres. b) Fungiform papillae, Papillae fungi formes, are scattered bet- ween the filiform as large, rounded eminences; their epithelial invest- ment is very thin and they are covered with secondary papillae. c) Circumvallate papillae, Papillae circumvallatae, eight to fifteen in number, are arranged in two rows, which run obliquely back- wards and inwards and meet in the middle line; each is surrounded by a layer of mucous membrane, and divided into several small papillae. At the point of junction of the two rows, is the Foramen coecum. Behind the circumvallate papillae are follicular glands, Glandulae lenticulares linguae.342. The Under Surface of the Tongue. 343.

II. 318 Muscles of the Pharynx. 346. The Muscles of the Pharynx, side view, after removal of the Vertebral Column. The cavity behind the mouth, nose and larynx is called pharynx; below, it is continuous with the oesophagus. The anterior wall of the pharynx communicates with the nasal cavity by means of the two posterior nares, Choanae, with the mouth by means of the isthmus of the fauces and with the larynx by means of the Aditvs ad laryngcm. On each side of the pharynx, at the back part of the inferior meatus, is the opening for the Eustachian tube, Ostium pharyngeum Tubae Eustachii; it is four lines long, directed obliquely from within and above, externally and inferiorly, and has irregular borders; between this opening and the posterior wall of the pharynx, the mucous membrane is deepened, forming R o s e n m u 11 e r's f o s s a. By means of the soft palate, when it comes in contact with the posterior pharyngeal wall, the pharynx is divided into two cavities, the Cavum pliaryngo-nasalc and Cavum phaTyngo-laryngewm.Muscles of the Pharynx. 19 347. The Muscles of the Pharynx, from behind, after removal of the Vertebral Column. The longitudinal muscles of the pharynx are: the two M. stylo- pharyngei, and the single M. azygos pharyngis, which latter is often wanting. The constrictor muscles of the pharynx, Constrictores pharyngis, form the lateral and posterior walls of the pharynx, and are all inserted into the fibrous raphe in the posterior median line. They form three pairs: The M. constrictor superior arises from the hamular process of the pterygoid plate of the sphenoid (Pterygo-pharyngeus), from the mylo- hyoidean line of the lower jaw (Mylo-pharyngeus), from the side of the tongue (Glosso-pharyngeus) and from the Fascia bucco-pharyngea (Bucco- pharyngeus). The M. constrictor medius arises from the greater cornu of the hyoid bone (Cerato-pharyngeus), and from the lesser cornu (Chondro-pharyngcus). The M. constrictor inferior arises from the outer surface of the thyroid cartilage (Thyreo-pharyngeus) and the cricoid cartilage (Crico-pharyngeus). The constrictors are so arranged, that the inferior partially covers the middle and the middle the superior. 3*H4S. Topography of the Abdominal Viscera,. L The Regions of the Abdomen.349.

View after removal of the Liver, the Stomach and the Small Intestines,Stomach. 24 352. The Stomach and the Duodenum, view from before. The oesophagus or gullet extends from the pharynx to the stomach. In the neck it lies behind and a little to the left of the trachea; it descends in the posterior mediastinum, opposite the place of bifurcation of the trachea, along the right side of the aorta, crosses the artery further down and passes through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm to the stomach. The stomach, Vcntricidus s. stomachus, lies in the epigastric region; above it is the diaphragm, below the transverse colon, behind the pancreas, and to the left side the spleen. It presents a cardiac orifice, Cardia (Ostium oesophaycum) a pyloric orifice, Pylorus (Ostium duodenalr), and an expanded part, the great cul-de-sac or fundus, Fundus ventriculi. This is the largest part of the stomach, and from there it gradually narrows towards the pylorus, in front of which is a prominence or bulging, called the small cul-de-sac or Antrum pyloricum Willisii. At the pylorus, between the stomach and duodenum is a distinctly visible, slight constriction.25 Stomach. 353. The Stomach and the Duodenum, after removal of the anterior wall. Between the cardiac and pyloric orifices the outline of the stomach is curved along its upper and lower borders; the upper con- cave border forms the lesser curvature, Curvatwra minor, and the lower convex, the greater curva tur e, Curvatwra major. The two sur- faces of the organ, the anterior, and the posterior, are limited by these two curvatures. If the stomach is filled, the anterior surface becomes an upper, and the posterior surface a lower. The peritoneal covering of the stomach is continued from it to the neighbouring organs by means of duplicatures; where the membrane passes from the cardia to the diaphragm, it forms the g a s t r o - p h r e n i c ligament, Ligamentum-phrenico-gastricum; where it passes from the fundus of the stomach to the spleen, it forms the g a s t r o - s p 1 e n i c ligament, Ligamentum gastro-lienale; from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the transverse fissure of the liver it forms the lesser omentum, Ligamentum hepato-gastricum, s. Omentum minus. The great omentum, Ligamentum gastro-colicum s. Omentum majus, passes down from the greater curvature of the stomach, covering the small intestines; it is a duplicature of the peritoneum, which then ascends to the trans- verse colon, and thence extends back to the pancreas (see Fig. 368 and 369)- The layers of the stomach from without inwards are: the peritoneum (serous coat), the muscular coat (longitudinal, circular and oblique fibres), and the mucous membrane rich in glands. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 4Small Intestine. 26 The d node n u m presents a curve, embracing the head of the pancreas; it is divided into a superior or superior transverse, a descending, and an oblique or inferior transverse portion. The superior portion is nearly completely invested by peritoneum; the inferior transverse portion lies between the two layers of the transverse mesocolon; the descending portion is covered by peritoneum only on its anterior surface. The jejunum and ilium form numerous convolutions in the abdominal and pelvic regions; they present no characteristic marks to distinguish the, termination of the one and the commencement of the other; they are attached to the mesentery, Mese.nte.rium, and by its root, Radix mesenterii, to the lumbar portion of the vertebral column. The layers of the small intestine are the same as those of the stomach: peritoneum (serous coat), muscular coat (consisting of external longitudinal and internal circular fibres), and the mucous mem- brane, which consists of a layer of muscular tissue, of folds called Valvular, conniventes, of villi and of glands.Small Intestine. 27 355.

Termination of the Ileum into the Coecum, in a Foetus of 7 months. Natural size of an inflated and dried in- testine, the posterior wall being partially removed. The mucous membrane of the small intestine contains transverse f(olds, Valvulae conniventes Kerkringii, which begin at the descending portion of the duodenum and are thence present throughout the rest of the small intestine; in the duodenum they are largest and most numerous, and from there they diminish gradually in size and number. In the descending portion of the duodenum, near the inner margin of the posterior wall, is a vertical projection, Plica longitudinalis, formed by tlie mucous membrane raised up by the united Ductus choledochus and pancreaticus, before they open into the intestine. Where the ileum opens into the coecum, the mucous membrane forms the ileo- coecal valve, Valvula coli, which consists of two folds. Throughout the whole extent of the mucous membrane of the small intestine there are numerous minute processes, Villi intestinalcs; each villus has abundant bloodvessels and one or more lymphatic vessels, being supported and held together by retiform lymphoid tissue. 4*Small Intestine. 28 357a. Segment of the In- 357b. Segment of tlie In- ner Surface of the Small ner Surface of the Small Intestine, natural size. Intestine, somewhat magnified. In the small intestine there are four kinds of glands: a) The crypts of Li e b erkiih n are minute tubular depressions, scattered between the villi. b) B runner's glands are acinous glands found only in the duodenum, especially numerous at its commencement. c) The solitary follicles are scattered throughout the mucous membrane of the small intestine; they are of different size and similar in structure to the lymphatic glands. d) The agminate d glands or glands of Peyer are aggre- gations of solitary glands, usually found only in the ileum; they are placed lengthwise in the intestine, at that part of the tube most distant from the mesentery. The large intestine commences at the coecum, to the lower part of which the vermiform appendix, Processus vermicular is, from 2 — 3 inches in length, is attached; the portion succeeding the coecum is the colon, divided into an ascending, Colon ascendens, transverse, Colon transversum, descending, Colon descendens, and sigmoid flexure, Flexura slgmoidca s. S romanum; the last portion is the rectum, Intestinum rectum. which ends at the anus. Only the coecum with the vermiform appen- dix, transverse colon and sigmoid flexure are completely invested by peritoneum, which is more or less wanting on the posterior surface of the other parts of the large intestine.29 Small Intestine. 358 a.

Henle. The longitudinal muscular fibres of the large intestine are in the coecum and colon collected into three flat bands, the Fasciae, Taeniae Valsalvae s. Ligamenta coli (see Fig. 351); these are the Fascia omentalis, mcsenterica and libera. In the sigmoid flexure and rectum they are spread out into a uniform layer of longitudinal muscular fibres; the circular fibres form at the end of the rectum the internal sphincter muscle, M. sphincter ani interims. The other muscles at the end of the rectum are the 3L sphincter ani extcmus and M. levator ani; the origin and connection of the latter with the M. recto-coccygeus is evident from the figure. In the mucous membrane of the large intestine there are certain permanent folds, Plicae sigmoickae (see Fig. 355), containing circular fibres, the last of which lies about 3 inches above the anus; this mucous membrane has no villi, but there are crypts of Lieber- kiihn and solitary follicles. Towards the end of the rectum the folds of the mucous membrane form the Sinus Morgagni.31 Liver, .300. The Liver, Hepar. View from above. The liver lies in the right hypochondrium and extends across into the left. Its anterior border, thin and sharp, is marked by a deep notch for the attachment of the Ligamentum suspensorium (broad, falciform ligament); its posterior rounded border is higher than the anterior; the right border is also rounded, the left, sharp, lies in front of the cardia of the stomach. The upper surface is convex and exactly moulded to the under surface of the diaphragm; it is marked off into a large right and a small left portion by the line of attachment of the suspensory ligament. The under surface of the liver (see Fig. 361) is divided by four fissures into five lobes; the fissures are: the fissure for the gall- bladder, the longitudinal fissure (divided into umbilical fissure and fissure for the Ductus venosus), the transverse fissure and the fissure for the inferior Vena cava. To the right of the fissure for the gall-bladder is the right lobe of the liver, to the left of the longitudinal fissure the left lobe; in front of the transverse fissure is the Lobulus quadratus, behind it the Lobulus Spigelii with the conical Tuberculum papillare, and with a process, the Tuberculum caudatum s. Lobulus caudatus) which extends to the under surface of the right lobe.Liver. 32 .361. The Liver, Hepar. View from below. The longitudinal fissure is divided by the transverse fissure (Porta Kepatis) into two parts; the anterior is called the umbilical fissure and lodges the round ligament, Ligammtwm teres, the posterior, called the fissure of the Ductus venosus, lodges the Ductus venosus Arantii. The fissure for the gall-bladder lodges the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the Vena cava, the inferior Vena cava, Vena cava ascendens. The vessels and nerves of the liver enter the transverse fissure, only the hepatic veins, Venae hepaticae, terminate in the inferior Vena cava. The peritoneal folds of the liver are: the suspensory liga- ment, Ligamentum suspensorium, attached by one margin to the under surface of the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall as far down as the umbilicus, and by its hepatic margin to the upper surface of the liver, and the coronary ligament, Ligamentum coronarium, attached to the posterior jjortion of the diaphragm and the posterior round border of the liver. The round ligament, Ligamentum teres, ascends from the umbilicus, enclosed in the longitudinal ligament, to the notch on the anterior border of the liver, and may be traced on the under surface of the liver, as far back as the inferior Vena cava.Liver. 33 362. The Peritoneal Ligaments of the Liver of a Child several weeks old. The peritoneal folds of the liver are further: a) between the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach the Ligamcntum licpato-gastricum s. Omentum minus; b) between the liver and duodenum the Ligamcntum hepato-duodenale; c) between the liver and upper part of the right kidney the Liga- mcntum licpato-renale; d) between the liver and colon the Ligamcntum hepato-colicum; the two latter ligaments are not always well developed. Between the Ligamcntum hepato-duodenale and Ligamcntum duodeno- renalc is the oval Foramen Winslowii, through which a finger or probe will pass into a space behind the stomach and lesser omentum, which space is called Saccus peritonei retroventricularis s. Bursa omcntalis. The round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein; the Ductus venosus Arantii, also obliterates after birth, is in the foetus a continuation of the umbilical vein, and joins the left hepatic vein at the point of junction of that vessel with the inferior Vena cava.

Cholecystis, is lodged in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver; it is pear- shaped; its fundus projects from the anterior border of the liver, its curved and constricted neck terminates in the cystic duct, Ductus cysticus. The mucous membrane is elevated into numerous small ridges; in the neck of the bladder and the cystic duct the mucous membrane is elevated into a series of folds, so as to present very much the appearance of a spiral valve, the Yalvula Hdsteri. The cystic duct unites with the hepatic duct which issues from the transverse fissure of the liver to form the common bile duct, Ductus communis choledochus; this is about the diameter of a goose-quill. The Ductus choledochus unites with the Ductus pancreaticus and runs along the posterior wall of the descending portion of the duodenum; it forms an elevation beneath the mucous membrane and opens on the inner surface of the intestine. The gall-bladder has an external fibrous coat, a middle muscular coat (longitudinal and transverse fibres) and the internal mucous membrane; it is lined by j^eritoneum only on its under surface and its fundus.35 Liver. 3(55. Diagram of the Structure of the Liver. Segment of an hepatic lobule. The liver is composed of a multitude of small lobules which are not completely insulated, being confluent in a part of their extent. The- interlobular branches of the hepatic artery and of the portal vein ramify between the lobules (the former probably transmit no blood directly to the capillary network of the lobules); these vessels collectively are called Vasa interlobularia. The hepatic veins commence in the center of each lobule as intralobular or central veins, Vasa intralobularia s. Venae centrales. The Vasa inter- and intralobularia are connected with each other by a capillary network, in the interstices of which are the hepatic cells. Between the hepatic cells are the commencements of the biliary vessels, which unite to form the biliary ducts, Ductus biliarii; these biliary ducts accompany the Vasa interlobularia. 5*36 Pancreas. .'S66. Pancreas, with Injected, Bifurcated Excretory Duct. View from behind, V, natural size. The pancreas lies behind the stomach, upon the lumbar portion of the diaphragm (see Fig. 351); the left extremity or tail, Cauda, is in contact with the spleen, while the right larger end, the head,' Caput, is embraced by the curvature of the duodenum. Its excretory duct, the Ductus pancreaticus s. Wirsungianus, about the size of a quill, extends trans- versely from left to right through the substance of the pancreas, unites with the Ductus communis clioledochus, and opens with it in the duo- denum ; rarely each duct has a separate opening. Often the pancreatic duct is bifurcated; then the lower branch unites with the common bile- duct, and the upper (Ductus Santorini) opens separately 1 inch or l'/2 inches above the lower. The spleen, Lien s. Splen (see Fig. 351 and 362) is a highly vascular gland, lying in the left hypochondrium, near the fundus of the stomach. The external and upper surface is in relation with the concave surface of the Pars costalis of the diaphragm, the inner surface, containing the hilus, Hilus lienis, is in relation in front with the stomach, behind with the left crus of the diaphragm; the anterior border is often slightly notched, the posterior, rounded. The peritoneal covering is con- nected with that of the stomach by means of the Lig. gastro-lienale, with that of the diaphragm by means of the Lig. phrenico-lienale; the spleen is also invested with a Tunica propria, which is reflected into the interior of the spleen in the form of large Trabeculac; in the interstices of the connective tissue frame work is the red pulp, Pidpa lienis.37 Peritoneum. 367. View of the Anterior Abdominal Wall, from inside. On the inner surface of the anterior abdominal wall are five folds of the peritoneum, which are caused by connective tissue bands running behind the peritoneum. The middle one of these folds is called Liga- mentum vesico-umbilicale medium, and contains the remains of the urachus, which forms a tubular communication between the urinary bladder and allantoic vesicle; the folds on both sides of it are called Ldgammta vesico- umbilicalia lateralia and these contain the obliterated remains of the hypo- gastric arteries; the folds on both sides of these are formed by the Vasa epigastrica. The fossae existing between these folds are called inguinal fossae: internal, middle, external. In the external inguinal fossa a small foveola, Foveola ingumalis, is seen, or in its place may be only a whitish cicatrix: place of the obliterated Processus vaginalis (abdominal opening of the inguinal canalj.38 Peritoneum.369. Diagram of the Reflections of the Peritoneum in the Female.40 Topography. 370. Horizontal Section through the Abdomen below the xiphoid appendix iu the pit of the stomach. From a one year old child in natural size. The peritoneum or serous membrane of the abdominal cavity, may be considered to form a shut sac, but in the female the two Fallopian tubes open at their free extremities into its cavity; it invests all the abdominal and pelvic viscera completely or partially, forming the visceral layer of the membrane, Peritoneum viscerale; then it is reflected upon the internal surface of the parietes of these cavities, forming the parietal layer, Peritoneum parietale. The reflections of the peritoneum are different in the pelvic organs of the male and female, but identical as regards the other organs. In the male the vesico-rectal fold or Excavatio vesico-rectalis is formed between the bladder and rectum; in the female between the bladder and uterus (with its appendages) the anterior Excavatio vesico-uterina and the posterior, deep Excavatio utero-rectalis. At the anterior abdominal wall the peritoneum forms the suspensory ligament of the liver, in the lower margin of which is the round ligament, the obliterated remains of the umbilical vein. Between liver and stomach the lesser omentum, Omentum minus, is attached; its right border contains the portal vein and is called Lig. liepato-duodenale. The great omentum, Omentum majus, descends from the stomach and in front of the small intestines as low down as the pelvis ; it then ascends again as far as the transverse colon, and aids in the formation of the transverse meso-colon; further back it covers the pancreas and forms the posterior wall of the Bursa omen- talis. The mesentery, Mesenterium, is the broad fold of peritoneum which connects the small intestines with the posterior wall of the abdomen.Coma ( suptr. 371. Tlie Cartilages the Larynx.

The larynx is composed of the following cartilages: a) The thyroid cartilage, C'artilago thyreoidea, consists of two muactLl- lateral lamellae, quadrilateral in form, united at an acute angle; the upper border is deeply notched in the middle line, imme- diately above the Pomum Adami (Prominentia laryngis), while on either side it is somewhat concave. The posterior border of each lamella terminates in the superior and inferior cornua, Comu super ius (longum) and Comu infer ius (breve). b) The cricoid cartilage, C'artilago cricoidea, lies below the thyroid cartilage, between its inferior cornua, with which it articulates; it is shaped like a signet ring and has a narrow anterior and a broad posterior portion. The upper border of the posterior portion has two oval facets for articulation with the bases of the arytenoid cartilages. c) The arytenoid cartilages, Cartilagines arytaenoideae (a right and a left), are pyramidal in form, and rest by their bases on the posterior and highest part of the cricoid cartilage; the apex of each cartilage is pointed and curved backwards and each has three surfaces, an inter- nal, external or anterior and a posterior, all covered by the laryngeal mucous membrane. The anterior angle of the base forms a horizontal projection, the vocal process, Processus vocalis, for the true vocal cord; the external, the muscular process, Processus muscularis, for the insertion of the posterior and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles.

Its anterior surface is curved forwards towards the tongue; its posterior surface concave from side to side, concavo-convex from above downwards; the convexity projecting backwards into the larynx is named the tubercle. The true ligaments (extrinsic and intrinsic) of the larynx are: a) Middle thyro-hyoid, Ligamentwm thyreo-hyoideum medium (also called Membrana obturatoria laryngis), between the hyoid bone and superior border of the thyroid cartilage, and the two lateral thyro- ll y o i d, Ligamcnta thyreo-Jiyoidea-lateralia, between the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage and the great cornua of the hyoid bone; the latter are two rounded yellowish cords and frequently enclose a fibro-cartilaginous nodule, Corpusculwm triticeum (cartilago-triticea).43 Larynx. 374.

The Laryngoscopic View in the Production View of the Posterior The vocal cords are situated one above the other, in the interior of the larynx, between the inner surfaces of the lamellae of the thyroid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages. The superior or false vocal cords, or Ligamenta glottidis spuria, are two folds of mucous membrane, enclosing a delicate fibrous band of elastic tissue, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament, attached to the anterior margin of the arytenoid cartilage and angle of the thyroid. The inferior or true vocal cords, or Ligamenta glottidis vera, are two fibrous bands of elastic tissue, the inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, covered by mucous membrane, and attached to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage and depression between the alae of the thyroid. The slit between the false vocal cords is called Glottis spuria, that between the true vocal cords Glottis vera; between the true and false vocal cords on each side is a depression, the Sinus s. Ventriculus Morgagni. The Mima glottidis between the true vocal cords has in quiet breathing a triangular shape, through which the anterior wall of the larynx (region of the thyroid cartilage, Lig. conicum, cricoid cartilage) and the trachea (tracheal cartilages) can be seen by means of the laryngo- scope ; by a corresponding position of the mirror, the posterior wall of the larynx (region between both arytenoid cartilages) and the trachea (Pars memhranacea) down to the place of bifurcation of the latter, can also be seen.

The trachea extends from the lower part of the larynx, on a level with the fifth cervical vertebra, to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi; in front and at the sides are a series of imperfect carti- laginous rings, Cartilagines tracheales, 16—20 in number, held together by a strong fibrous membrane; the posterior portion is membranous, and presents trans- verse muscular fibres of the unstriped variety. The right bronchus, Bronchus dexter, is more horizontal, shorter and wider than the left bronchus, Bronchus sinister; the former has 6—8, the latter 9—12 cartilages, similar to those of the trachea, The bronchi, upon entering the substance of the lungs, divide, the right into three, the left into two branches, these again into smaller branches, and so on; each of the smaller subdivisions enters a pulmonary lobule, and, again sub- dividing, ultimately terminates in the intercellular passages and air cells of which the lobule is composed.51 Lungs. 387. The Thoracic Viscera of a Child. View from before. Natural size. (The thymus gland pushed somewhat upwards; the lungs turned aside.) The lungs, Pulmones, are placed one in each of the lateral cavities of the chest; the concave base rests upon the diaphragm, the concave inner surface is in part adapted to the convex pericardium, and the external surface, which is convex, corresponds to the form of the cavity of the chest. The right lung is broader and shorter than the left, and divided into three lohes, Lohi pulmonum; the left is smaller, narrower and longer than the right, and has only two lobes. The base is of semilunar form, the anterior border thin and sharp, the posterior border rounded and broad. At the inner surface is a fissure, the Hilus s. Porta pulmonis; here the bronchus and pulmonary artery enter the lung, and the two pulmonary veins have their exit from the lung. These structures, the bronchus, pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, form together the root of the lung, Radix s. Peduncidus pulmonis. 7*52 Pleura, mammar. tnt raediust. ant- 388, Horizontal Section of the Thorax, showing- the relative Position of the Viscera, and the Reflections of the Pleurae. The parenchyma of the lung is composed of lobules, Lobuli s. Insulae pulmoncdes, which are quite distinct from each other. Each lobule is com- posed of one of the ramifications of the bronchial tube and its terminal air-cells, and of the ramifications of the pulmonary and bronchial vessels, lymphatics and nerves. The walls of each lobular bronchial tube are closely covered by numerous saccular dilatations, the air - c el 1 s, Cdlulae pulmonales. The air-cells are surrounded by the capillary network, placed between the pulmonary artery and vein; the artery conveys the venous blood to the lungs, the vein returns the purefied blood to the heart. In purely anatomical relation with the thoracic viscera are: The thyroid gland, Glandula thjreoidea; it is situated at the upper part of the trachea, and consists of two lateral lobes, Cornua laterdMa, connected together by a narrow transverse portion, the isthmus ; occasionally a third lobe, Cornu medium, arises from the isthmus. The glandular sub- stance consists of round vesicles, which are closed cavities. The thymus gland is developed only in the foetus and up t<> the second year of life, when it ceases to grow and gradually dwindles, until at puberty it has almost disappeared. It lies partly in the thorax and partly in the lower region of the neck, and is composed of two lateral lobes, which become elongated inferiorly into two lateral cornua. Its' structure is analogous to the lymphatic glands.53 Topography. 389. Topography of the Posterior Mediastinum. The left Lung and Heart are turned to the right. The two lungs and the inner surface of the thorax are invested by serous membranes, the two pleurae; the portion investing the sur- face of the lung is called the Pleura. pulmonalis, while that which lines the inner surface of the chest is called the Pleura costalis (Fig. 388); that part of the Pleura costalis which comes in contact with the upper surface of the diaphragm is called Pleura phrmica. The third serous membrane in the thorax covers the heart and commencement of the great vessels, and is called pericardium. The space left in the median line of the chest by the non-approximation of the two pleurae is called the mediastinal space, Cavum mediastini, or simply mediastinum. The part of this space in front of the pericardium is called the anterior mediastinum, Cavum mediastini anterius, and that behind the pericardium, the posterior mediastinum, Cavum mediastini posterius.54 Topography. 390. Topograph)' of the Thoracic Viscera. Owing to the oblique position of the heart, towards the left side, the anterior mediastinum is not parallel with the sternum, but directed obliquely from above downwards and to the left of the median line; its length corresponds to that of the sternum. The posterior mediastinum is an irregular triangular space, running parallel with the vertebral column; the organs contained in it are evident from Fig. 389, in which the left lung and the heart are lifted out of the thorax and laid to the right and the lateral wall of the posterior mediastinal space is dissected away. The arch of the aorta curves over the left bronchus; the oesophagus forms a spiral around the aorta; to the right of the descending aorta is the Vena azygps, to the left the Vena hemiazygos. Between the Vena azygos and aorta is the thoracic duct, Ductus tlioracicus (see Fig. 388), which ascends behind and to the left of the oesophagus, to terminate at the angle of junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins.55 Topography. 391.

The Urinary Organs of a Child, natural size. Heitzmann, Atlas. II.58 Kidneys. 395. The Right Kidney and Supra-renal Capsule. 2/3 natural size. The kidneys, Penes, are situated in the lumbar region at the back part of the abdomen; they have somewhat the shape of a bean; their anterior surfaces are covered by peritoneum, their posterior lie on the Musculi qua- drato-lumborum. The right kidney, placed somewhat lower than the left, is in relation anteriorly with the ascending colon, the left with the descending colon. The internal, concave border presents a fissure, the Hilus s. Porta rents, for the entrance and exit of the renal vessels. They are surrounded by loose areolar tissue containing much fat, C'apsula adiposa, and by a proper fibrous coat, Capsula fibrosa, which forms a thin, smooth investment, closely covering the organ. The surface of the kidney is in the adult entirely smooth, but in the new-born is divided into lobules, Penes lobati (see Fig. 394). On splitting open the kidney by a longitudinal section, it is found to consist of a medullary substance, Substantia mcduttaris s. tubidosa, around which is the reddish-brown cortical substance, Substantia corticalis s. vascidosa s. glomeridosa; the former consists of palish-red masses, the pyramids of Malpighi, 10—15 in number, whose apices, directed towards the hilus, are called Papillae renales. The prolongations of the cortical sub- stance between any two pyramids are called columns of Bertini.Kidneys. 59 Bertini 396. Longitudinal Section through the Kidney. The renal artery enters the hilus dividing'into four or five branches, which, penetrating' the substance of the organ, pass into the cortical substance between the pyramids, and continue to divide and subdivide; these branches have a con- voluted arrangement and finally form the Glomeruli venules, which are surrounded by a capsule. A vein smaller than the artery emerges from the glomerulus, and divides into branches, from which a network of capillaries arises. The Tubuli uviniferi commence at the capsule of the glomerulus opposite the place where the artery enters and leaves; they are at first convoluted (Tubuli contorti I. ordinis), but approaching the medullary portion become more or less spiral (spiral tubule of Schachowa); they then enter the pyramids and form loops (looped tubule of Henle, Ansae Hcnlei), pass back into the cortical substance to again become convoluted (Tubuli contorti II, ordinis) and are connected with the straight or collecting tubules. These straight tubules, Tubuli recti s. Belliniani, enter the pyramids and are arranged in groups; the tubes open at the papillae by fine orifices, the Cvibrum benedictum; the separate bundles of each tube form the pyramids of Ferrein, these together form a Pyramis Malpighii (see Fig. 399). The vascular loops in the pyramids come from the capillaries of the cortical substance. The Calices renales minores receive the Papillae venules into their wide mouths and unite (2—3) to form the Culices renales majoves (infundibula); these again, by their junction form the Pelvis renulis, which lies in the hilus behind the renal artery and vein and becomes continuous with the ureter, which carries the urine into the bladder, 8*Kidneys. 60399. Diagram of the Structure of the Kidney.Topograph}', 62 400. Sagittal Median Section through the Male Pelvis. From the frozen cadaver of a man of about twenty years. The urinary bladder, Vesica urinaria, is the reservoir for the urine; it is of oval form and lies behind the Symphisis ossium pubis, in front of the rectum in the male, of the uterus in the female. Its summit, Vertex, is connec- ted to the umbilius by means of the Ligamentum vesico-umbilicale medium (urachus) ; the body becomes enlarged posteriorly and interiorly into the base or Fundus vesicae; the sides are connected to the umbilicus by means of the Ligamenta vesico-umb'dkalia latcralia (obliterated hypogastric arteries). ■— The bladder has the following layers: peritoneum at the summit, the posterior wall and the sides; muscular layer composed of longitudinal and transverse fibres (Detrusor urinae) and of circular fibres (Sphincter vesicae); submucous connective tissue and finally the mucous membrane covered with stratefied epithelium. The ureters pass obliquely downwards and inwards, enter the coats of the bladder, and open into the fundus of the bladder by two narrow and oblique slit-like openings; at the line of union of these with the urethra is the trigone, Trigonum Lieutandii; the summit of this triangle is called Uvula vesicae (see f ig. 403); here the muscular layer of the bladder is more strongly developed.63 Topography.64 Organs'of Generation. erttoneu 3llj Si'fMusculari.

Sagittal Median Section through the Male Pelvis, the Penis being erect. (Construed out of Fig. 400-) The male urethra, 6—7 inches long, extends from the neck of the bladder (Orificium vesicale), to the Meatus urinarius (Orificium cutaneum); in the erect state of the penis it forms only a single curve, but in the flaccid state a double curve. It is divided into the prostatic portion, Pars prostatica, membranous portion, Pars memhranacea (Isthmus) and the spongy portion, Pars cavernosa. Along the floor of the prostatic portion is a narrow, longitudinal ridge, the Caput gallinaginis s. Colliculus seminalis, formed by an elevation of the mucous mem- brane; at the fore part of the Caput gallinaginis is the Vesicula prostatica, (Sinus pocularis), and upon or within its margins are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts; on each side of the caput are the orifices of the prostatic ducts. The membranous portion is the narrowest part of the urethra, surrounded neither by the prostate nor by the Corpus cavernosum. The spongy portion is surrounded by the Corpus spongiosum (Corpus caver- nosum urethrae), which is situated in the groove on the under surface of the Corpora cavernosa penis; at its commencement, the Corpus spongiosum forms a rounded enlargement, the bulb, Bulbus urethrae, therefore the part of the urethra contained within the bulb, which is somewhat dilated, is called Bulbous portion, Pars Lulbosa; here the excretory ducts of Cowper's glands open. The lining membrane of the urethra is beset with small glands and follicles, and larger recesses or Lacunae Morgagni, especially abundant in the bulbous portion, At the glans penis the urethra is again dilated, forming the Fossa navicular is. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 966 Male Organs of Generation. 405. The Right Testicle and Epididymis, natural size. The two testicles, Testiculi, the glands producing the semen, are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords. Each testis has an ovoid form; its upper end is directed forwards and outwards, its lower end backwards and inwards. The Tunica albuginea s. propria surrounds the glandular structure of the testicle, and, at its posterior and upper border is reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum called the Mediastinum testis s. Corpus Higlvmori. From this septum numerous slender fibrous cords are given off, which pass to be attached to the inner surface of the Tunica albuginea; they join with similar cords given off from the Tunica albuginea to form spaces which enclose the separate lobules of the testis. Each lobule consists of from 2—5 convoluted tubes, the Tubuli seminiferi; as these approach the Corpus Highmori they unite with one another and finally form the Eetc Halleri; from this rete, 12—19 stronger tubules, the Vasa efferentla, arise, which perforate the Tunica albuginea, beneath the Globus major of the epididymis, in the convoluted canal of which they ultimately terminate.67 Male Organs of Generation. 400. Testis and Epididymis, Injected with Mercury. The epididymis lies at the posterior border of the testis; it- has an upper enlarged extremity, the head, or Globus major, and a lower pointed extremity, the tail, or Globus minor, which is continued into the Vas deferens. The lobules, which are formed by the convolutions of the seminiferous tubules coming from the testis, are of pyramidal form and are called Coni vasculosi Holler i. By the union of these coni a single canal or duct is formed, the intervening and subsequent convolutions of which constitute the epididymis itself. This single canal gradually becomes thicker at the Globus minor of the epididymis, its windings become less and less tortuous, and now the Vas deferens is formed, which ascends from the lower end of the epididymis along the back of the testicle; it then passes in the spermatic cord to the inguinal canal, through this to the abdominal cavity and the posterior wall of the bladder, and finally opens at the base of the bladder, after union with the corresponding seminal vesicle, in the Caput gattinaginis. Attached to the upper end of the testis or to the epididymis are one or more small pedunculated bodies; these are termed Hydatis Mbrgagni (see Fig. 405). With the duct of the epididymis is often connected a small convoluted duct, the Yasculum aberrans Halleri. 9*68 Male Organs of Generation. 407. a. b. c. Diagrammatic View of tlie Descensus testiculi. The testis is developed in the embryo in the abdominal cavity, and is covered by peritoneum, with the exception of the posterior wall where the Vas deferens and the bloodvessels enter and leave; it is supported in its passage from the abdomen into the scrotum by a duplicature of the peritoneum, called the Mesorchivm. In the mesorchium a conical-shaped cord, the Gubcrnaculum testis s. Hunteri, is attached to the testicle and the bottom of the scrotum; it is surrounded by striped muscular fibres and is divided below into three processes. By a shortening of this cord the testicle gradually passes through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, a small pouch of peritoneum preceding the testis in its course through the canal; this pouch is called Processus vaginalis peritonei; the blood- vessels and Vas deferens are not contained in it. The cavity of the Processus vaginalis closes after birth from the inguinal canal towards the testicle, and only a thin connective tissue cord, called the Ligula, remains; at the testicle and a part of the epididymis the cavity remains pervious, and the serous covering, which entirely surrounds the testicle constitutes the Tunica vaginalis propria testis. The spermatic cord, Funiculus spermatious, is the bundle of vessels and nerves, which supports the testicle, and is invested, as is also the testis, by the Tunica vaginalis communis; this is a continuation of the Fascia transversa abdominis and is also called i n f u n d i b u 1 i f o r m fas c i a ; on its outer surface the bundles of the ere master muscle lie.Male Organs of Generation. 69 408. The Base of the Bladder and Upper Portion ol the Urethra, view from behind. After a dried specimen, natural size. The cutaneous pouch, which contains the testes and spermatic cords, is called scrotum; it is divided by a median external raphe into two lateral halves; the cavity of the scrotum is divided into two, by the Septum scroti. Beneath the integument is the Tunica dartos, formed of unstriped muscular fibres, which is continuous with the superficial fascia of the groin, perinaeum and inner side of the thighs. The seminal vesicles, Vesiculae seminales, are two lobulated membranous pouches at the base of the bladder behind the prostata, each having an upper obtuse and a lower pointed extremity, which latter unites with the corresponding Vas deferens, to form with it the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts, Ductus ejaculatorii, run between the prostate gland and posterior wall of the prostatic portion of the urethra forwards and downwards, and end in the urethra at the Caput gaUinaginis. The prostate gland, Prostata, has the form of a chestnut and encloses the first part of the urethra in such a manner, that the greater part of the gland lies behind the urethra. The posterior surface of the prostate is divided by two slight ridges into three lobes.Male Organs of Generation. 70 V. dors. peni Corp. A A. dors, pen t's Septum pen is Corp. cavern, uret/i r. 409. Transverse Section of the Penis in the Distended State. The muscular tissue constitutes the proper stroma of the prostate; it is arranged in several layers, between which, strong muscular bands, decussating freely, form meshes in which the glandular substance of the organ is imbedded; the excretory ducts of the glands open on both sides of the Caput gaUinaginis. Cowper's glands (see Fig. 410) are compound racemose glands, about the size of peas; they lie behind the bulb of the urethra at the lower wall of the membranous portion, surrounded by the fibres of the M. transversus perinei profundus. Their excretory ducts pass obliquely for- wards and open at the bulbous portion of the urethra (see Fig. 403)- The male organ, Penis, is composed of. erectile tissue, enclosed in three cylindrical fibrous compartments; of these, two, the Corpora cavernosa penis, form the principal part of the organ, while the third, Corpus cavernosum urethrae or Corpus spongiosum encloses the urethra. The Corpora cavernosa penis are cylindrical, erectile bodies, intimately connected along the median line for their anterior three-fourths, their posterior fourth being separated to form the two Crura penis, by which the penis is connected to the rami of the pubes; each crus presents a slight enlargement, the bulb of the Corpus cavernosum. The upper surface of the united cavernous bodies is marked by a slight groove containing the single Vena dorsalis and the two Arteriae dor-sales penis; the under surface presents a longitudinal groove, in which is lodged the Coipus spongiosum. Each Corpus cavernosum is enclosed in the fibrous Tunica albu- ginea, which sends off numerous fibrous bands, Trabecidae; these cross the cavity in all directions, subdividing it into a multitude of interstices. The fibrous septum between the Corpora cavernosa is incomplete in front, exhibiting numerous clefts. The erectile tissue consists of a venous plexus lodged in the interspaces between the trabecular The arteries of the Corpora cavernosa are the cavernous branches of the internal pudic (Art. profundac penis), and branches from the dorsal artery of the penis. Within the cavernous tissue, the numerous arterial branches are supported by the trabeculae, and terminate in branches of capillary minuteness which open into the intertrabccular spaces.Topography. 71 410. Lateral View of the Male Pelvic Organs at Birth. Natural size. The Corpus cavernosum urethrae (Corpus spongiosum) encloses the urethra; at its posterior extremity it forms a rounded enlargement, the Bulbus urethrae (see Fig. 408), and at its anterior extremity the Glans penis, which overlaps the anterior rounded extremity of the Corpora caver- nosa penis. The fibrous tunic of the Corpus spongiosum is much thinner and the meshes between the trabeculae much smaller than those of the Corpora cavernosa penis. The Glans penis has at its sum m i t, Apex glandis, a vertical fissure forming the external orifice of the urethra; its base is formed by the Corona glandis, behind which lies a depression, the Cervix or Sulcus retro-glandular is. The Glans penis is surrounded by a duplicature of the skin, the prepuce, Praeputium; the covering of the glans is very thin and at the Meatus urinarius is continuous with the mucous membrane of the urethra. The prepuce is connected with the Glans penis by means of a fold, the Fracnulum praeputii. The Fascia penis, a continuation of the superficial fascia of the abdomen surrounds the body of the penis up to the Corona glandis; near the root of the organ there is in front a dense band of fibro-elastic tissue, named the suspensory ligament, Ligamcntum suspjensorium penis.Topography. 72 411.

The urinary b 1 a d.d e r in the female rests posteriorly against the uterus; it is larger in the transverse than in the vertical diameter, and its capacity is greater than in the male. Between the bladder (which in the above figure is shown in an empty state) and uterus is the vesico- uterine fold, Excavatio vcsico-vtcrina, formed by the peritoneum, and between the uterus and rectum the recto-uterine; Excavatio utero-rectalfe; in both these spaces serum was contained in the above case. The female urethra is l'/2 inches long and much more dilatable than the male. It is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, is imbedded in the anterior wall of the vagina, and opens in the vulva above the entrance to the vagina, surrounded by a pouch of mucous membrane.Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 1074 Female Organs of Generation. Sections of vessels 413. Vertical Section through au Ovary with large Corpus luttum. The ovaries, Ovar/'a, lie in the plane of the superior pelvic aperture, enveloped in the posterior layer of the broad ligament of the uterus; they are of an oval form; each has an outer obtuse extremity, and an inner end, connected to the uterus by the proper ligament of the ovary, Ligamentum ovariiproprium, an upper and a lower surface, and an anterior and posterior border. Before menstruation has begun the surface of the ovary is smooth and even, but in later years, after repeated menstruations, it becomes more uneven and is marked by jiits and scars. The ovaries are not completely invested by peritoneum, the anterior borders remaining free, and here the bloodvessels enter and leave — Hilus ovarii. The proper fibrous covering is called the Tunica propria s, albuginta, which is perforated by the bloodvessels at the hilus. The Stroma ovarii is abundantly supplied with bloodvessels and consists of spindle-shaped cells with a small amount of ordinary connective tissue; in the stroma are a great number of closely set vesicles of various sizes, the Graafian follicles. Each larger follicle is surrounded by a dense connective tissue covering, the Theca folliculi; then follows a structurless layer with pavement epithelium, the so called Membrana granulosa. The cavity contains a light yellow fluid, the Liquor folliculi. In one part of the Graafian follicle the epithelial cells are collected into a mass, the Discus oqphorus s. proligcrus, in the center of which the ovum is imbedded.75 Female Organs of Generation. 414. Diagram of a Graafian Follicle. The ovum is a small spherical body of about i/l2- of an inch in diameter, barely visible to the naked eye; it consists of the vitelline membrane or Zona pdlucida, the j o\\t,Vitdlus, and the germinal vesicle, Vesicida germinativa. The Zona pdlucida forms a transparent layer around the opaque yolk substance, which is composed of granules consisting of protagon and fat; the germinal vesicle forms the nucleus of the ovum and consists of a transparent, structureless membrane, containing a watery fluid, and an opaque spot, the germinal spot, Macula ger- minativa. The largest Graafian follicles usually lie near the surface of the ovary, where they may be seen projecting somewhat. At the time of menstruation the mature follicles burst, and the Liquor folliculi and ovum are liberated and pass into the Fallopian tube; after the discharge of its contents, the empty and collapsed Graafian follicle is filled with blood-tinged fluid, and in a short time its circumference is occupied by a firm reddish-yellow substance, the Corpus luteum; the former, cicatrized opening in the follicle is called Cicatrix. With the number of the menses the number of the cicatrices is also increased. Those Corpora lutea which remain after a menstruation, are called false, spuria; those remaining after the libe- ration of an impregnated ovum and after pregnancy: true, Corpora lutea vera. The Parovarium or organ of Rose n m ii 11 e r consists of from 15—20 closed tubes, and is situated in the broad ligament, Ala vesper tilionis, between the ovary and Fallopian tube. 10*76 Female Organs of Generation. 415.

The womb, Uterus, is a hollow, muscular organ, situated between the rectum and urinary bladder; it is pear-shaped, flattened from before backwards. The fundus is the upper broad extremity of the organ; the body, Corpus, gradually narrows as it extends from the fundus to the neck, Cervix s. Collum; the junction of the body and neck is, especially in younger persons, marked by a constriction. The cervix projects into the upper end of the vagina, and this projecting portion is called the vaginal part, Porlio vaginalis uteri. The broad 1 i g a- m e n t s, IAgamenta lata, pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis; the round ligaments, Ligamenta rotunda, con- tinuations of the uterus substance, are enclosed in the anterior layer of the broad ligaments (see Fig. 412). The round ligaments pass through the inguinal canal to the fore part of the pubic symphisis, and become lost in the Labia majora. Besides the broad ligaments, the peritoneum forms ligaments between the bladder and uterus, the two anterior, liga- menta vesico-uterina, and between the rectum and uterus, the two posterior, Ligamenta recto-uterina.Female Organs of Generation. 77 416. The Specular View of the Portio vaginalis uteri in the virginal state. 417. The Specular View of the Portio vaginalis uteri after repeated confinements. The cavity of the uterus, Cavum uteri, is triangular; its base is directed upwards towards the Fundus uteri; in the two angles of the triangle are the openings of the two tubes; the inferior portion is prolonged into the cavity of the cervix, Canalis cervicis uteri. This canal is somewhat dilated in the middle, its upper extremity opening into the cavity of the uterus is called the internal orifice, Orificium uterinum, its lower end opening into the vagina is called the external orifice, Orificium vaginale. The external orifice presents, before a labor has taken place, a smooth, trans- verse aperture, with an anterior longer lip, Labium anterius, and a posterior shorter lip, Labium posterius; after parturition, the external orifice becomes irregular, and sometimes fissured or cleft. The uterus is composed of three coats: a) an external, derived from the peritoneum, only present at the anterior and posterior surfaces and fundus of the uterus; b) an internal mucous membrane, which, on the anterior and posterior walls of the cavity of the cervix, forms rugae, the Palmae plicatae s. Arbor vitae (see Fig. 415). Between the rugae are closed follicles, the Ovula Nabotlu; in the cavity of the uterus, the mucous membrane has numerous tubular glands, the Glandulae utrioulares. c) The middle, very dense coat of the uterus consists of smooth muscular fibres, which are disposed in bundles and cross each other in different directions; between the bundles are blood-vessels and areolar tissue. In the pregnant uterus the muscle fibres are increased by new formations both in thickness and length.Female Organs of Generation. 78 418. Section through a Virginal Vagina. View from behind; the Vagina dilated, to show the Columnae, and Rugae on its inner surface. The Fallopian tubes or oviducts, Tubae Fallopianae s. Ovi- ductus (see Fig. 412 and 415), commence at the superior angles of the uterus and pursue an modulatory course; they are inclosed in the free margin of the broad ligaments. The inner half is narrow and cord like, Isthmus, the outer half is enlarged and called Ampulla. The opening of the Fallopian tube into the uterus is called Ostium tubae uterinum. The external orifice, Ostium tubae abdominale, which lies in front of and below the ovary, and com- municates with the peritoneal cavity, is wide and trumpet-shaped, and its margins are surrounded by a series of fringelike processes, termed Fimbriae; to this part of the tube the term fimbriated extremity or Morsus diaboli is applied. One of these jjrocesses, Fimbria ovarica, is connected with the outer end of the ovary, and probably effects (by means of ciliated epithelium) the passage of the ovum from the ovary into the tube. The Fallopian tubes have three coats similar to the uterus. The vagina is a membranous canal, about 3 inches in length, which commences at the vulva with the Ostium vaginae, and ends above at the Fornix. The vaginal portion of the uterus extends into the fornix, thereby dividing it into an anterior, shallow, and a posterior, deeper part.79 Female Organs of Generation.

The Labia majora and minora pressed apart. The anterior and posterior walls of the vagina are in contact with each other; the uppermost part of the posterior wall is invested hy peritoneum. The walls of the vagina are composed of connective tissue, which contains a dense layer of smooth muscle fibres and a venous net- work. The mucous membrane of the vagina is provided with numerous papillae; its inner surface presents anteriorly and posteriorly a slightly elevated ridge, forming the columns of the vagina, Columna plicartim anterior et posterior, which gradually become less marked at its upper end (see Fig. 418). At the orifice of the vagina the mucous membrane forms, in the virginal state, a duplicative, the hymen, which usually appears semi- lunar, with an upper opening, but sometimes circular, perforated at the upper margin (Hymen annularis) or pierced with several small apertures (Hymen cribriformis), or (rarely) may be fimbriated (Hymen fimbriatus), (see Fig. 412)- After rupture of the hymen, Defloratio, small rounded elevations, the Carunculae myrtiformes, remain.Female Organs of Generation. 80 The vulva or pudendum includes all the parts perceptible externally, viz: the Mons Veneris, Labia majora, Labia minora s. Nymphae, the Hymen and the Clitoris. The Labia majora extend from the Mons Veneris, which is covered with hair, downwards to the perinaeum, where they are connected by a transverse fold, the FraenvZum labiorum; the two points where they are united are called the anterior and posterior commissures; the elliptical interval between the Ljabia majora is called Bima pudendi. The space between the fracnulum and posterior commissure is named the Fossa navicularis. The Labia minora are situated within the Ljabia majora and extend from the clitoris down- wards to become lost one on each side of the orifice of the vagina; at the sides of the clitoris each labium divides into two folds, which surround the Glans clitoridis, the inferior folds forming the Fraenidum clitoridis, the superior uniting to form the Praeputium clitoridis. The space between the Labia minora from the clitoris to the entrance of the vagina, is called the vestibule, Vestibidum vaginae; along either side of the vesti- bule are two large oblong masses, consisting of a plexus of veins, the Bulbi vestibvM. The clitoris is a small elongated body corresponding to a diminutive penis, but differing in having no corpus spongiosum nor urethra connected with it below; it has two Corpora cavernosa, a Glaus which is imperforate, a double Fraenulum, a Praepvtiiun and two MM. ischio- cavcr'nosis, called MAI. crectorcs clitoridis. The female urethra does not perforate the clitoris, but opens in the vestibule, above the entrance of the vagina, with a rounded orifice, surrounded by a fold of mucous membrane. On each side of the commencement of the vagina the glands o f B a r t h 0- line open; these are analogous to Cowper's glands in the male.Female Organs of Generation. 81 421. The Right Mammary Gland during Lactation. 2/3 natural size. The mammary glands or Mammae, lie upon the Pcctorcdis major muscle, between the third and sixth ribs; they are separated from each other by the bosom, Sinus. They are hemispherical eminences, presenting just below the center a small conical prominence, the n i p p 1 e, Papilla s. Mamilla. The nipple is surrounded by the areola, which has a colored tint and is covered with numerous tubercles; at the tip of the nipple the excretory ducts of the mammae open, at the surface of the areola, the Glandulae lactiferae dberrantes. — The mamma is formed of from 16—24 lobes held together by fibrous or areolar tissue, and having adi- pose tissue penetrating between them; each lobe is composed of a number of smaller lobes, and these again of smaller and smaller lobules; the smallest lobules consist of a cluster of rounded vesicles, which open into the smal- lest branches of the lactiferous ducts. The excretory ducts of the lobules unite to form a larger Ductus lactiferus s. galactopliorus, of which each corresponds to one of the lobes. These ducts converge towards the areola, beneath which they become considerably dilated, especially during lactation, so as to form sinuses, Sinus lactei; then they again become reduced in size, and proceed without communicating with each other, to the summit of the nipple, where they open by separate orifices.

The perinaeum is the space between the anus and scrotum in the male and between the anus and posterior commissure in the female. The male perinaeum is longer than the female. The muscles of the perinaeum are: a) M. ischio-cavernosus s. erector penis (see Fig. 425 and 426) covers the unattached part of the crus penis; it arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, behind the crus penis, whence its fibres are directed forwards to an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides and under surface of the crus penis; sometimes it joins its fellow on the other side in a median aponeurosis. b) M. buibo-cavernosus s. accelerator urinae (see Fig. 425 and 426) lies upon the Bulbus urethrae, and is connected with the M. sphincter ani externus and the M. transversus perinei superficialis; it consists of two sym- metrical halves, which arise from the Raphe bulbi. Its fibres encircle the bulb, and are inserted into the fibrous covering of the Corpora caver- nosa penis. 11*Topography. 85 427. Topography of the Male Perinaeum. VI. View after removal of the M. levator ani. c) The MM. transversa perinei (see Fig. 425 and 426). The M. trans- versns perinei superficialis arises from the ascending ramus of the ischium, runs forwards and inwards, and unites with the corresponding muscle of the other side, as well as with the Sphincter ani extemus, the Accelerator urinae and the Levator ani. — The M. transversus perinei profundus (usually described as the hindmost fibres of the Compressor urethrae) lies above the superficial, arises from the ascending ramus of the ischium and the descending ramus of the pubes, and is united with the muscle of the other side and the following. In it Cowper's glands are imbedded. d) The M. constrictor s. compressor urethrae is a single muscle, which arises from the descending ramus of the pubes together with the M. trans- versus perinei profundus; it surrounds the membranous portion of the urethra, some of the fibres being in front of and others behind that portion. The M. transversus perinei profundus and the M. constrictor urethrae form together a broad, muscular plate, whose fibres cross each other in the median line, the Centrum carneo-tendinenm perinei s. Diaphragma urogenital.Topography. 86 428. Topography of the Female Perinaeum. In the female the M. ischio-cavernosus s. erector clitoridis lies upon the clitoris, on the back of which the muscles of the two sides unite in a common tendon. The M. bulbo-cavernosus is wanting; it is replaced by the M. constrictor cumii s. sphincter vaginae. This muscle is to be looked at as a continuation of the M. sphincter ani externus, whose right half passes to the left wall of the orifice of the vagina, whose left half to the right wall of the orifice, and it is inserted partly into the back of the clitoris, partly runs to the Fascia superficialis. Sphincter ani externus and Sphincter vaginae therefore form one common muscle, which has the figure of an 8; both are voluntary muscles. The lower bundles of the M. trans- versus perinei run to the median line, the upper bundles to the vagina. If the coccygeal origin of the M. sphincter ani externus is removed, a fibrous layer is reached, which unites the MM. levatores ani; between this layer and the apex of the coccyx the coccygeal gland of L u s c h k a, Glandula coccygea, lies; it is about the size of a hemp seed, sometimes single, sometimes formed of several lobes, and consists in great measure of dilated arterial vessels (see Fig. 426).87 Fascia pelvis. 429. The Ligaments of the Visceral Layer of the Fascia pelvis. View of the Symphisis from behind, the Bladder being turned back. The fasciae of the perinaeum are: a) Fascia perinei supcrficialis; b) Fascia perinei profunda; c) Fascia pelvis. — The pelvic fascia consists of two parts, which are known as the obturator fascia and the recto-vesical fascia; the latter forms the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia. The obturator fascia covers the inner surface of the M. obturator interims; it is attached above to the iliac portion of the ilio-pectineal line; in front, to the body of the pubis along an oblique line extending from the obturator foramen to below the symphisis; behind, to the great sciatic notch, and below it joins the falciform process of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, by means of which it is connected to the rami of the ischium and pubes. At the upper end of the obturator foramen the fascia joins the upper edge of the obturator membrane, for- ming an arch over the border of the muscle, and bounding below the short canal by which the obturator vessels and nerves issue.88 Fascia pelvis. 430. The Ligaments of the Visceral Layer of the Fascia pelvis. View of the Rami of the Ischium and the Bladder from behind. The visceral layer of the pelvic fascia (recto-vesical fascia), is attached anteriorly to the back of the pubis, from which it is separated by the origin of the M. levator ani; laterally it springs from the obturator fascia along a curved line passing from the upper part of the obturator foramen to the ischial spine. Lying upon the upper surface of the Levator ani, the visceral layer, which forms a fibrous partition comjjletely separating the pelvic cavity above from the perineal space below, passes in front to the jirostata and anterior surface of the bladder, as Ligamenta pubo-prostatica (better pubo-vesicalia) lateralia; in the middle portion it passes to the prostate, as Ligamenta ischio-prostatica, then it enters between the base of the bladder and rectum as Fascia recto- vesicalis; finally in the posterior portion it reaches the outer surface of the rectum as a thin layer.89 Fascia pelvis. 431. Anterior Surface of the Symphisis, after removal of the Corpora cavernosa penis. The deep perineal fascia, Fascia periiiei profunda, is stretched across the subpubic arch on the deep surface of the crura of the penis and bull) of the urethra. It consists of two layers, an anterior and a p o s t e r i o r; the anterior is attached on each side to the rami of the pubis and ischium, while posteriorly it becomes connected with the posterior layer. This layer is perforated by the urethra about an inch below the symphisis. The posterior layer consists of right and left lateral halves, which are separated in the middle line by the urethra close to the neck of the prostate. The layer is superficial to the anterior fibres of the Levator am muscle, which lie between it and the recto-vesical fascia, and is connected with a thin web of areolar tissue, which extends back- wards on the surface of the M. Levator ami, and is distinguished as the anal fascia. Heitzma nn, Atlas. II. 1290 Topography. 432. Frontal Section through the Pelvis of a Child.

The superficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains much adipose tissue in its meshes; it is continuous with the Tunica dartos of the scrotum; the deep layer is a thin layer, free from fat, which covers the M. ischio- and bulbo-cavernosus and the M. transversus perinei superficialis; it is attached to the crus penis and becomes the Fascia penis (see Fig. 424). The covering of the two MM. levatores ani by the Fascia pelvis and Fascia perinei profunda, their direction, as well as their relation to the Cavum iscliio-rcctalc, which is rich in fat, is demonstrated in the above figure.Heitzmann, Atlas II. 13 V. NERVOUS SYSTEM.Membranes of the Brain and Spinal Cord. 93 433. The Processes of the Dura mater. The brain and spinal cord are covered by three membranes: the Dura mater (Meninx fibrosa), the Arachnoidea (Meninx serosa) and the Pia mater (Meninx vasculosa). The Dura ' mater forms the external covering; it is a thick and dense inelastic fibrous membrane, whose outer surface adheres closely to the inner surface of the boues, forming their internal periosteum. It sends numerous processes inwards, into the cavity of the skull, and is prolonged to the outer surface of the skull through the various foramina which exist at the base; its fibrous layer forms sheaths for the nerves which pass through these apertures. In certain situations in the skull, the fibrous layers of this membrane separate, to form sinuses for the passages of venous blood, Sinus durae matris. The Dura mater also sends inwards into the cavity of the skull three strong membranous processes, the Falx cerebri s. Processus falciformis 'major, the Falx cerebclli s. Processus falciformis minor, and the Tentorium cerebclli. 13*Membranes of the Brain and Spinal Cord. 94 434. The Brain and its Membranes. View from above. The Falx cerebri descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain; it is narrow in front, where it is attached to the Crista galli, broader behind, where it is connected with the tentorium. Along its upper convex border, which is attached to the inner surface of the skull as far back as the internal occipital protuberance, runs the superior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falci- formis superior; its free concave margin is turned towards the Corpus caMoswm, but does not touch it. The Falx cerebelli descends from the back part of the tentorium, with which it is connected, along the internal occipital crest, towards the Foramen magnum, bifurcating there into two smaller folds; its sinus is not constant. The Tentorium cerebelli is placed between the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and the hemispheres of the cerebellum; its anterior free border presents a large oval opening for the transmission of the Crura cerebri. The pituitary fossa of the body of the sphenoid bone is partially closed by a fourth process, the Opcrcullum sellae turcicae.435. Diagram of the Membranes of the Spinal Cord. Transverse Section. Magn. = 2. The Dura mater of the cord, Pars spinalis durae matris, con- tinuous with that which invests the brain, extends, below, as far as the top of the sacrum; beyond this point it is impervious, being continued, in the form of a slender cord, to the back of the coccyx, where it blends with the periosteum. It is not adherent to the bones of the spinal canal, which have an independent periosteum, and the intervening space is occupied by a plexus of veins, Plexus venosi spindles. The Dura mater of the cord accompanies each of the spinal nerves into its vertebral foramen, and sends off from its inner surface to each side of the cord, from 20—23 slen- der processes in the form of denticuli, which serve to support the cord, and are collectively called the Ligamentum denticulatum. The Arachnoidca is a delicate membrane, situated between the dura mater externally and pia mater internally. The space between the dura mater and arachnoid is called subdural space or Cavum arachnoideale; that between the arachnoid and pia mater, sub-arach- noid space, Cavum subarachnoidealc; the latter contains a considerable quantity of fluid, the cerebro-spinal fluid, but the former also contains some fluid. The arachnoid passes over the various eminences and depressions on the cerebrum and cerebellum, without dipping down into the sulci and smaller grooves. It invests the brain (Arachnoidea cerebralis) and spinal cord (Arachnoidea spinalis) much less closely than the pia mater. From the posterior median fissure, Sulcus longitudinalis posterior, of the cord, a septum passes to the inner surface of the Arach- noidea, which is only complete in the cervical region. Upon the external sur- face of the dura mater, in the vicinity of the longitudinal sinus, the Oranula (wrongly Glandidae) Pacchioni lie; they are also found in other situations. The Pia mater, the innermost membrane, dips down into all the sulci of the brain and into the fissures of the cord, and is intimately adherent to their surfaces. It is a highly vascular membrane; at the transverse fissure of the cerebrum it is invaginated into the lateral ventricles and over the third ventricle, and there forms the Velum interposituru or Tela choroidca superior; it is also prolonged over the posterior wall of the fourth ventricle, where it forms the Tela choroidea inferior and choroid plexuses of that ventricle. At the point where the cord terminates, the Pia mater is con- tinued down as a long, slender filament, Filum terminate.Cerebral Convolutions. 96 436, Left Hemisphere, from the outside. After Eberstaller. The brain, Encephalon, is divided into four principal parts, the cerebrum, cerebellum, Pons Varolii and Medulla oblongata. The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres, right and left. Each hemi- sphere has a dorsal or outer, convex surface, in contact with the vault of the cranium, an inner, flat surface, which forms one side of the longi- tudinal fissure, and an irregular under surface, in which is a deep cleft, the fissure of Sylvius. The anterior extremity is called frontal pole, the posterior, occipital pole. The entire surface of the hemispheres presents a number of convoluted emi- nences, the convolutions or Gyri, separated from each other by fissures or Sulci. At certain places, several, otherwise separate sulci may blend together, and this is the chief cause for the great variety in the convolutions found in different brains; if this is the case, a concealed convolution will always be found beneath the union of the fissures; the places where these deep gyri are most frequent, are marked by points in the diagram. The deepest of all the fissures is the Fissure of Sylvius, Fissura Sylvii; it commences as Fossa Sylvii, at the under surface of the brain, turns outwards and backwards (Ramus posterior fissurae Sylvii) and ends by divi- ding into a Ramus ascendens and a short Ramus descendens. At the place where it curves around, the Ramus anterior ascendens branches off, often also a Ramus anterior horizontalis. The fissure of Sylvius divides the frontal lobe and partly also the parietal lobe from the temporal lobe; the central lobe or island of Reil, Insula Reilii, lies deeply within its commencement, being rarely visible except when the lips of the fissure are separated; the parts of the hemi- sphere covering it, are called Operculum. The central fissure or fissure of Rolando, Sidcus centralis s. Rolandi, is situated about the middle of the outer surface of the hemisphere; it commences near the lougitudinal fissure and runs downwards and forwards to terminate a little above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius; the parallel convolutions which bound it, are named the ascending frontal, or Gyrus centralis anterior and the ascending parietal, or Gyrus centralis posterior. That portion of the brain, situated in front of the fissure of Rolando, and above and in front of the fissure of Sylvius is called the frontal lobe, Lohus frontalis.97 Cerebral Convolutions. 437. Cerebrum, from above. After Eb erstaller. The anterior central or ascending frontal convolution is limited in front by the transverse frontal fissure or Sulcus praecentralis, which is usually divided into two parts, the S. praecentralis superior and inferior. The portion of the frontal surface anterior to this convolution is occupied by three gyri, the superior, middle and inferior frontal convolutions, or Cfyri frontalis I, II and III; the fissures separating them are the superior and inferior frontal, S. frontalis superior and inferior. The middle frontal convolution is the broadest; it is divided anteriorly by the S. frontalis medius into two portions. At the Gyrus frontalis inferior a Pars ascendens s. operculavis, a Pars triangularis and a Pars orbitalis are distinguished. The posterior central or ascending parietal convolution is limited posteriorly by the intra-parietal fissure or <S'. retrocentralis ; from it, two convolutions, the superior and inferior parietal lobules, Lobulus parietalis superior and inferior, run backwards; the sulcus separating them is the *S'. interparietals. The fissures of the temporal lobe divide the inferior parietal lobule into three portions: G. supraniarginalis, G. angularis and G. parietalis posterior. About midway between the posterior extremity of the brain and the fissure of Rolando is the deep parieto-occipital fissure, Fissura parieto-occipitalis; it is only seen to a slight extent on the outer surface, the greater part of it being on the internal surface of the hemisphere; a little behind it, the S. inter- parietal'^ ends with a transverse portion: S. occipitalis anterior s. perpendicidaris externus. That portion of the external surface, which is bounded in front by the sulcus of Rolando and behind by the parieto-occipital fissure and the S. occipi- talis anterior, is called parietal lobe, Lobus parietalis; it comprises the ascending parietal convolution, the superior and the inferior parietal lobules.Cerebral Convolutions. 98 438. Right Hemisphere, from the inside. After Eberstaller. The occipital lobe, Lohus occipitalis, is situated at the posterior extremity of the brain; it is bounded in front by the *S. occipitalis anterior, and below by the S. occipitalis lateralis; the convolutions separating this lobe from the parietal lobe, have been named Plis de passage sup. and inf. (Fig. 436). The temporal or teinporo-splicnoidal lobe, Lobus temporalis, is bounded in front and above by the fissure of Sylvius. Three transverse sulci, whose posterior ends are turned upwards (Pars ascendens), divide it into three convolutions. The uppermost of these sulci is always the best developed; it is called the first or superior temporal (temporo-sphenoidal) or parallel sulcus, Sulcus temporalis primus s. parallelus; the second or middle temporal sulcus, S. temporalis secundus, is generally interrupted by a vertical gyrus; the third or inferior, S. temporalis tertius, lies on the under surface of the lobe. Between them, the first, second and third temporal convolutions, Gyrus temporalis I. s. superior, G. temporalis II. s. medius, G. temporalis III. s. inferior, lie. Posteriorly, the I. and II. are continuous with the inferior parietal lobule, the III. with the inferior occipital convolution (Fig. 436 and 437). On the internal surface of the hemisphere the Gyrus fornicatus or con- volution of the Corpus callosum is seen; it turns around the anterior extre- mity of the Corpus callosum, and is interrupted anteriorly by the Fossa Sylvii; its lower half is the Gyrus hippocampi or uncinate convolution, also called Subiculum cornu Ammonis, which ends with the uncus. Above the G. hippocampi is the Fissura hippocamp>i; concealed in it are the gray Fascia dentata Tarini and the white Fimbria. Superiorly, the Gyrus fornicatus is bounded by the calloso- marginal sulcus, which commences somewhat below the Genu corporis callosi and ends a short distance behind the upper extremity of the sulcus of Eolaudo. Somewhat behind and below the Splenium corporis callosi a deep fissure, which posteriorly divides into two rami, commences in the G. fornicatus; one ramus extends upwards and is called parieto-occipital fissure, Fissura parieto-occipitalis s. perpendicularis interna; the other extending pretty horizontally backwards, is called calcarine fissure, Fissura calcarina, and ends at the pole in the S. extremus.99 Cerebral Con volutions. 439. Cerebrum, from below. After E b erst all er. The cuneate lobule, Cuneus, is a wedge-shaped area lying between the calcarine and parieto-occipital fissures; the quadrate lobule, Prae- cuneus, is a four-sided area lying between the parieto-occipital and cal- loso-marginal fissures; the latter is imperfectly separated from the Gyrus fornicatus by the Sulcus subparietalis. The prolongation of the anterior cen- tral convolution on the median surface of the hemisphere, forms part of the paracentral lobule, Lobulus paracentralts. From the summit of the cuneus a deep convolution runs through the lower end of the parieto- occipital fissure to the Gyr. fornicatus (Fig. 438). On the under surface of the frontal lobe are only two fissures: 1. the olfactory fissure, Sulcus olfactorivs, in which the olfactory tract and bulb lie, 2. to the side of this is the orbital fissure, Sulcus orbitcdis, which varies a great deal. The orbital portion of the superior frontal convolution, Gyr. frontalis superior, is called the Gyr. rectus; the part between the orbital sulcus and Fossa Sylvii is the orbi- tal portion of the inferior frontal convolution (Fig. 436). On the under surface of the united temporal and occipital lobes a deep antero posterior sulcus, the occipitotemporal sulcus, separates a lateral from a median portion; the former lies between this sulcus and the third or inferior temporal sulcus and is called Gyr. occipito-temporalis lateralis s. fusiformis; the latter, Gyr. occipito-temporalis mcdialis, whose anterior portion is called Gyr. hippocampi, the posterior, Lobulus lingualis.

The examination of the cerebrum is made in the following manner: The skull-cap is removed after a circular incision has been made with the saw, between the superciliary ridges and frontal eminences and above the external occipital protuberance. The Dura mater is cut open lengthwise on both sides of the longitudinal sinuses, and from the middle of these sections, a transverse cut is made; it is then folded back. The Falx cerebri is to be separated at the Crista gatti and laid back, and the veins opening into the longitudinal sinus must be divided. In this manner both hemispheres of the cerebrum and the great longi- tudinal fissure are brought into view. — The two hemispheres can be removed by horizontal sections down to the upper surface of the Corpus cattosum.101 Cerebrum. 441. Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum, with partly evened Lateral Ventricles. 2/3 natural size. The Corpus callosum s. Commissural maxima, connects the two hemi- spheres of the cerehrum, its white substance being continuous with the internal medullary matter of both hemispheres; this large white medul- lary mass, surrounded by the margin of grey matter, is known as the Tegmentum ventriculorum s. Centrum semiovale Vieussenii. Along the middle of the upper surface of the Corpus callosum is a longitudinal furrow, Raphe superior corporis callosi, which is bounded by two, slightly elevated bands, the Striae lonc/itudinales Lancisii, and crossed by transverse furrows, .Chordae transversales Willisii. Its anterior border curves downwards and backwards to the Tuber cincreum and Corpora mamillaria at the base of the brain; in its course, it forms a distinct bend, the Genu corporis callosi; posteriorly, the Corpus callosum forms a thick rounded fold, the Splenium s.

The Corpus callosum roofs in the body and anterior cornu of the lateral ventricles, Ventriculi laterales, which are brought into view after removal of their covering. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity or body, Cclla media, and three c o r n u a, an anterior, a posterior and an inferior or descending, which extend from it in different directions. In the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle are found: a) The Corpus striatum, with a broad extremity directed forwards, and a narrow end directed outwards and backwards. On the outer side of the Corpus striatum is the lenticular or lentiform nucleus, Nucleus lentiformis, a biconvex grey mass, surrounded by white substance. In front and below the lenticular nucleus a rounded mass of yellowish grey matter, the Nucleus amygdalae, is situated, and on the outer side of the lenticular nucleus is a thin lamina of grey matter, the Claustrum. The white substance between the lentiform nucleus and Corpus striatum forms the internal capsule, Capsula interna, that between the lentiform nucleus and claustrum, the external c a p s u 1 e, Capsula externa. b) The Thalamus opticus, situated behind the Corpus striatum, is composed of white substance intermixed with grey matter.

The Corpus callosum and Fornix tricuspidalis, which lies below it, form the roof of the third ventricle. Upon lifting up of the Corpus callosum, the triangular Septum luciclum is found between its anterior half and the fornix ; it is a thin, semi-transparent septum, placed between the anterior cornua of the two lateral ventricles; it is composed of two lamina having an interval between them, the fifth ventricle or Ventriculus scptipellucidi. The posterior half of the Corpus callosum is in immediate contact with the fornix. The Fornix is an arched longitudinal white commissure lying between the two optic thalami; it consists of two lateral halves, which are separated from each other in front and behind, forming the anterior and posterior pillars or crura. The anterior pillars, Crura anteriora (Columnac) fornicis, cylindrical in form, can be traced downwards in front of the optic thalami, curve backwards to the Corpora albicantia s. Corpora mammillaria, and from there they can be traced upwards again into the substance of the optic tha- lami. The interval between the anterior pillar of the fornix and the anterior part of the optic thalamus on each side, is called the Foramen Monroi.Cerebrum. 105 445.

Between the two posterior pillars of the fornix, Crura posteriora fornicis, is a triangular portion, which is covered by the under surface of the Corpus callosum; this part of the Corpus caMosum is marked by transverse, longitudinal and oblique lines and is called Lyra Davidis or Psalterium. The posterior pillars of the fornix are continued on into the fimbria. The Tela choroidea superior or Velum interpositum is a prolongation of the pia mater; it is a vascular membrane and can be exposed to view after dividing the fornix and turning aside its two halves; it has small branches of the Art. profunda cerebri, and in its center two venous trunks, which flow backwards to the single Vena cerebri magna. In it are further found two vascular fringes, the choroid plexuses, Plexus choroidei, which at first lie together (Plexus choroideus medius), and then pass through the foramen of Monro into the lateral ventricles, Plexus choroidei laterales.106 Cerebrum. 447.

The Third Ventricle, laid open. View from above, natural size. After removing the Tela ehoroidea superior (s. Velum interpositum), and pushing apart the inner surfaces of both optic thalami, the third ventricle, Ventriculus medius s. tcrtius is laid open to view. It is bounded by six walls: an upper, the Tela ehoroidea superior; two lateral, the inner surfaces of both optic thalami; a lower, corresponding to the middle of the base of the brain; an anterior, formed by the anterior pillars of the fornix, and a posterior, formed by the Corpus quadri- geminum. The lateral walls are connected by three commissures; the anterior commissure, Commissura anterior, in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, the posterior commissure, Commissura poste- rior, in front of the Corpus quadrigeminum, and the middle com- missure, Commissura media s. mollis, which connects the grey portions of the inner surfaces of both optic thalami (sometimes wanting). Beneath the anterior commissure is the Iter s. Aditus ad infundibidum, and beneath the posterior commissure, the Aditus ad aquaeductum Sylvii, which latter, situated below the Corpus quadrigeminum, connects the third and fourth ventricles. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 15108 Cerebrum. 449. Lateral View of the Pons Varolii and the Medulla Oblongata. Natural size. The Corpora quadrigemina are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and posterior commissure; they are two pairs of rounded emi- nences, the anterior, larger, being called the nates, the posterior, smaller, the testes. Laterally the eminences are prolonged into prominent white tracts, the Braclua corporis quadrigcmini, of which the Brachia anteriora on both sides are connected with the Corpus gcniculatum anticum, and enter the optic thai ami, and the Brachia postcriora with the Corpus genicidatum posticum, and partly reach the optic thalami, partly the tegmentum. The pineal gland, Glandula pinealis s. Penis cerebri s. Conariurn, consisting mostly of grey matter, lies upon the anterior eminences of the Corpus quadrigcminum, the nates; it sometimes contains the Ventriculus conarii. The peduncles, Pedunculi conarii, arise from the anterior extremity of the pineal gland; they pass forwards and downwards upon the inner margin of the optic thalami, to the anterior pillars of the fornix, as Taeniae medullares (see Fig. 448). Above the Corpora quadrigemina is the Splenium corporis callosi (see Fig. 447), and between the two, the transverse fissure of the cerebrum; through this fissure the pia mater passes inwards into the third ventricle, as Tela clioroidea media; the fissure is prolonged along the Pes hippocampi major (Comu ammonis) to the base of the lower cornu and contains a continuation of the pia mater to the Plexus choroidals lateralis.Cerebrum. 109 450. Base of the Brain, view from below. 2/3 natural size. After separation of the tentorium from the pyramids of the petrous bones, and cutting through the origins of the cranial nerves, the Medulla oblongata and the vertebral arteries, the whole brain is taken out of the cranial cavity and turned about, and thereby the base of the brain is brought to view. Here are seen: a) The anterior perforated space, Substantia perforata anterior, which consists chiefly of grey matter; it is divided into a middle and two lateral spaces, which serve for the transmission of bloodvessels. In front of the lateral portions a pyramidal grey eminence, the Trigonium olfactorium lies; it is prolonged into the Nervus olfactorius. b) The optic commissure or Chiasma nervorum opticorum, is formed by the two optic tracts, Tractus optici, which wind across the under surface of the Pedunculi s. Crura cerebri; from the chiasma, the round optic nerves, Nervi optici, arise. 15*Cerebellum. 110 451. The Cerebellum, view from below. Natural size. At the base of the brain (Fig. 450) there are further seen: c) The Tuber cinereum and the Infundibulum. The Tuber cinereum is situated behind the chiasma and forms part of the floor of the third ventricle. From the middle of its under surface a hollow conical process, the Infundibuhim, is continued downwards and forwards. d) The pituitary body or Hypophysis cerebri, situated in the Sella turcica. It is a small vascular mass, consisting of an anterior and a posterior lobe, which are separated from one another by a fibrous lamina. e) The Corpora albicantia or inammillaria s. Globuli mcdullares, two small, round, white masses, each about the size of a pea. f) The posterior perforated space, Substantia perforata posterior, placed in the angle between both Crura cerebri, composed of grey matter, is continued anteriorly into the Tuber cinereum. g) The Crura cerebri s. Pedunculi cerebri, two thick, cylindrical bundles of white matter, which emerge from the anterior border of the pons, and diverge as they pass forwards and outwards to enter the under part of either hemisphere. In a transverse section, each Crus cerebri is seen to consist of a lower, flat bundle of fibres, the proper Pedunculus s. Caudex, which is hollowed out for the upper, larger bundle, the Tegmentum caudicis; between both is a mass of dark grey matter, the Substantia nigra pedunculi. The two hemispheres of the cerebellum are connected with each other by the Pons Varolii, and behind the pons, between the two hemi- spheres of the cerebellum is the Medulla oblongata. The Pons Varolii or Tuber annulare presents an under (anterior) and an upper (posterior) surface, an anterior and a posterior border. On the middle of its under surface is seen a longitudinal groove, Sulcus basilaris, which lodges the basilar artery. At the anterior border the Crura cerebri'diverge; at the sides are the middle peduncles of the cerebellum or Processus ccrcbelli ad pontem, which connect the pons with the hemi- spheres of the cerebellum. The posterior border of the pons is in relation with the Medulla oblongata.Ill Medulla Oblongata. 452, Pons Varolii and Medulla Oblongata, view from below. Natural size. The Medulla oblongata s. Bulbus medullae spinalis, is continuous below with the spinal cord, on a level with the lower margin of the Foramen magnum; on each side, separated by fissures, are three columns. In the middle line, separated by the anterior longitudinal fissure, Sulcus longitudinalis anterior, are the two pyramids, Pyramides; external to these, are the olivary bodies, Olivae, at their sides, the resti- f or ni bodies, Corpora restiformia, which, because they enter the hemi- spheres of the cerebellum, are also called the inferior peduncles of the cerebellum. In the anterior longitudinal fissure the decussation of both pyramids, Decussatio pyramidum, is visible. In the substance of the olive is a white Nucleus s. Corpus dentatum olivae, surrounded by a grey, serrated lamina (see Fig. 462). After removal of the Medulla oblongata (separation of the restiform bodies and loosening from the Pons Varolii) a complete view of the under surface of the cerebellum is obtained. The two hemispheres of the cerebellum are separated from each other by a deep fossa, the val- ley, Vallecula Reilii. In this fossa, the Medulla oblongata, just removed, was contained; the fossa ends posteriorly in the Incisura marginalis posterior.Cerebellum. 112 453. The Cerebellum, view from before. The Tonsils completely, the Cuneiform Lobes partially removed. Natural size. Upon the under surface of each hemisphere of the cerebellum are four lobes (see Fig. 451): a) The inferior posterior lobe, Lobus inferior posterior s. semilunaris; b) The cuneiform lobe, Lobus cuneiformis (this comprises the two lobes usually called digastric and slender lobes); c) The amygdala or tonsil, Tonsilla, projecting into the fourth ventricle; finally d) The Flocculus s. Lobulus, with the Pedunculus flocculi, which latter reaches down to the inferior vermiform process as posterior medul- lary v e 1 u m, Velum cerebelli posterius. The middle portion of the cerebellum lying in the valley, is called inferior vermiform process, Vermis inferior: the parts entering into the composition of this body are: a) The Tuber valvulae or Commisswa brevis, uniting the inferior posterior lobes of the two sides; b) The pyramid, connecting the digastric lobes; c) The uvula, placed between both tonsils, and d) The nodule, Modulus Malacami, the anterior pointed termination of the inferior vermiform process, which is connected to the peduncles of the flocculus by means of the posterior medullary velum. This velum is of a semilunar form on each side, its anterior margin being free and concave, its posterior convex margin continuous with the central white substance of the inferior vermiform process; between it and the nodule and uvula behind, is a deep fossa, called the swallow's nest.Cerebellum. 113 454, The Cerebellum, view from above. Natural size. The superior peduncles of the cerebellum, Processus e cerebello ad testes (Processus cerebelli ad corpora quadrigcmina), pass from the hemispheres of the cerebellum to the Corpora quadrigemina; they form part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. Between the con- verging crura of the superior peduncles, the anterior medullary velum or valve of Vieussens, Velum medullare anterius s. Valvula cerebelli, is stretched, covering the canal leading from the third to the fourth ventricle (see Fig. 453). At the upper surface, the two hemispheres of the cerebellum are connected by the superior vermiform process, Vermis superior, corresponding to whose anterior and posterior extremities are two notches, the Incisura marginalis anterior and posterior. The upper surface is separated from the lower by the deep Sulcus magnus Tiorizontalis. In each hemisphere there are: a) The antero-superior or square lobe, Lobus superior anterior s. quadrangular is, then b) The p o s t e r o - s u p e r i o r or semilunar lobe, Lobus supe- rior posterior s. semilunaris. The parallel gyri of the Vermis superior separate the following three structures: a) The central lobe, Lobulus centralis, which has a central portion and tWo alae; b) The Monticulus, whose highest point, Cacumcn, is continued posteriorly into the Declive; a) and b) as connections of the gyri of the anterior lobe ; c) The Folium cacuminis, situated in the Incisura marginalis posterior, connecting the posterior lobes.114 Cerebellum. fentr.

Below the central lobes are found the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum which run upwards and forwards towards the base of the Corpora quadrigemina. The anterior medullary velum is stretched between the two peduncles; its upper surface is marked by four or five transverse, grey laminae, with intervening sulci, which together constitute the Lingida, connected posteriorly with the central lobe. A slightly ele- vated ridge, the Fraenulum veli medullaris, descends upon the anterior part of the velum, from the median raphe of the posterior Corpora quadri- gemina; on both sides of it may be seen the fibres of origin of the fourth nerve. Behind the Brachium posterius of the testes, at the side of the anterior end of the Processus cerebelli ad corpus quadrigerninum is found the fillet, Lemniscus s. Laqueus (see Fig. 45G)- Sections both of the vermiform process and of the hemispheres of the cerebellum present a beautifully foliated or arborescent appearance, the Arbor vitae vermis and Arbor vitae cerebelli. After removal of the vermiform process the upper (posterior) sur- face of the Medulla oblongata, which forms the floor of the fourth v e n- tricle, Vcntricidus quartus, is brought to view.Cerebellum. 115 Pedunc conarii Gland.pineal.

The two posterior columns of the cord, which bound the posterior median fissure, are continued upwards and forwards, to reach the hemi- spheres of the cerebellum as rest iform bodies, Corpora restiformia; where they'enter the hemispheres, they show in section a grey nucleus, the Tuberculum cine.re.um. The posterior median fissure, Sulcus longitudinal posterior, diverges on each side to an angle, which is open in front, and forms with the angle of the Processus cercbelli ad corpus quadrige- minurn, the boundary line of the Fovea s. Fossa rhomboidea, the floor of the fourth ventricle. The grey basal surface of the Fovea rhomboidea is called Lamina cinerea foveae rhomboideae; it is divided by a median fur- row into two halves. Where the restiform bodies begin to diverge, two narrow white cords, the Funiculi gracilcs are placed between them; these broaden out at the posterior angle of the Fovea rhomboidea into an expansion, the Clava. That part of the restiform bodies lying just outside to the Funiculi graciles, is called the Funiculus cuneatus. At both sides of the median raphe of the Fovea rhomboidea are the Funiculi teretes; these are covered posteriorly by the grey Alae cinereae. Heitzmann, Atlas.

In the Lamina cinerea white, transverse fibres, Chordae acustlcae, are seen (see Fig. 456), and along the clavae two bands, Taeniae fossae rhomboideae. The posterior angle of the Fovea rhomboidea is called Calamus scriptorius; the anterior angle (covered by the anterior medullary velum) communicates through the Aquaedudus Sylvii with the third ventricle. The lateral angles of the Fossa rhomboidea form the lateral recesses, Pecessus laterales (see Fig. 456). The Lamina cinerea of the Fovea rhom- boidea presents at the place of exit of the Processus cercbcUi ad Corpus quadrigeminum an intensely dark color — Locus caeruleus. The fourth ventricle is closed jiosteriorly by the pia mater as Tela choroidea inferior, which, being fixed at the Taeniae fossae rhomboideae, the peduncles of the flocculus and the posterior medullary velum, forms the Plexus choroidals ventriculi quarti. In transverse section of the hemispheres of the cerebellum the Nucleus dentatus s. Corpus rhomboideum is seen in front; it is a white nucleus with dentated borders.Brain of an Embryo, 117 Cerebrum quudng. Cerebellum 'Med- oblong. Cerebrum Fossa Sylvii L N. OLFACTOR. n. N. OPTIC.

Transverse Sections of the Medulla Oblongata and Spinal Cord. After Fr. Arnold. The spinal cord is not uniformly cylindrical, but marked by two enlargements, an upper or cervical, and a lower or lumbar, corres- ponding to the points of exit of the largest nerves. It is divided into two symmetrical halves, each of which consists of an external white cortex, and an internal grey jiucleus; the fissures which so divide it, are on the anterior surface, along the middle line, the anterior median fissure, Sulcus longitudinalis anterior, and on the posterior surface, the posterior median fissure, Sulcus longitudinalis posterior; the anterior median fissure is marked along the whole length of the cord, the posterior, well marked only at the cervical portion and Corns terminalis. The two parts of the central grey nucleus are united by the middle grey commissure, in front of it the two halves of the external white substance by the anterior white commissure; between these two commissures the small central canal of the spinal cord extends through the whole length of the cord. The relation of the grey nucleus to the white cortex varies in different situations; the shape of the former corresponds in general to an x with narrower posterior cornua and broader anterior cornua; the white matter increases in quantity from below upwards. The grey nucleus consists principally of multi- polar ganglion cells; the white matter chiefly of longitudinal nerve fibres, with the transverse fibres of the roots of the spinal nerves. The longitudinal fibres form six columns, separated by shallow fissures ; they are: Two anterior columns, on both sides of the anterior median fissure ; Two lateral columns, between the origins of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves; Two posterior columns, on both sides of the posterior median fissure; Opposite the uppermost cervical vertebrae, the pyramidal columns, which take part in the decussation, are found between the anterior columns; between the piosterior columns are found the Funiculi graciles, which form with the cuneate funiculi the restiform bodies.119 Nerve Fibres in the Spinal Cord.Fibres of the Brain. 120 (Jniva ant fomic.

Natural size. The grey substance of the brain and spinal cord consists principally of ganglion cells. In the spinal cord it forms the nucleus, is continued along the floor of the III. and IV. ventricles up to the Tuber ciuereum and Infundilndum, forms a layer on the convolutions of the cerebrum and cerebellum, finally separate grey masses so-called nuclei; such nuclei are the grey masses of the olivary bodies, of the hemispheres of the cerebellum, the Corpora quadrigemina, the optic thalami and Corpora striata, the Pons Varolii, then the Tuber cinereum of the restiform bodies, the lenticular nucleus, the claustrum and amygdalae of the cerebrum. The three pairs of columns of the cord are continued into the Medulla oblongata as pyramids, olivary bodies and restiform bodies, the lateral columns becoming the pyramids, the anterior the olivary bodies, and the posterior the restiform bodies. The pyramids arc continued upwards into the Pednnculi cerebri, the olivary bodies run to the Corpus quadrigeminum and the restiform bodies form the Pechvnculi cerebclli. ■See note, page 122.Fibres of the Brain. 121 * See note, page 122. 465. The Fibres of the Tr uncus Cerebri,*' View from below. Natural size. The fibres of the posterior column of the cord are con- tinued partly into the restiform bodies, partly into the tegmentum; those of the lateral column are grouped into three bundles, of which the posterior helps to form the restiform body, while the middle forms the Funiculus teres, and together with the Cvus cerebelli ad cerebrum (ad Corpus quadrigemiiium) the base of the tegmentum, and the anterior becomes the pyramid. The anterior column is continued to form the olivary body, and, forming the Lemniscus, runs to the Corpus quadrigemiiium. Some of the diverging fibres end in the cerebral ganglia, while others pass through and receive additional fibres from them, and, as they emerge, radiate into the anterior, middle and posterior lobes of the hemi- spheres; these fibres are called Corona radiata. The commissural fibres or commissures connect the hemispheres with each other, different parts of the same hemisphere and the cerebellum with the cerebrum. Such commis- sures are: between the cerebral hemispheres the Corpus cattosum, the anterior and posterior commissures in the third ventricle; between the hemispheres of the cerebellum the Pons Varolii, and vermiform pro- cess; between cerebrum and cerebellum the Crura cerebelli ad Corpora quadri- gemina; between Corpus quadrigemiiium, tegmentum and optic thalamus the Brachium anticum et posticum of the Corpus quadrigemiiium.122 Fibres of the Brain. 400. The Fibres of the Pallium Cerebri* 2/3 natural size. From the Corpus ccdlosum the fibres pass outwards on both sides into the cerebral hemispheres; the fibres which curve backwards into the posterior lobes are called the Forceps posterior, those which curve forwards and inwards to the anterior lobe, Forceps anterior, finally those which help to form the covering of the posterior and inferior horn of the lateral ventricles, the Tapetum. The upper surface of the pallium contains the convolutions enume- rated above, and is covered by a layer of grey matter up to 2 lines in thickness. On the anterior and median portions of the hemispheres is a deep note h, the Incisura pallii, whose floor is formed by the Corpus ccdlosum, and its lateral walls by the inner surfaces of the anterior and upper lobes. Another deep notch is the Sylvian fissure, which divides the inferior lobe from the anterior and upper lobes; in it most of the arterial branches are found. Fig. 464, 465 and 466 are drawn from alcohol specimens and with the aid of Fr. A niol d's figures. * By some German anatomists, the brain is divided into two parts: „Hirnstamm", Truncus cerebri, and ,,Hi rnmantel", Pallium cerebri, i. e. the cerebral hemispheres. The former comprises the peduncles of the cerebrum and cerebellum and the tegmentum, the latter, the Corona radiata, commissures and convolutions.123 Cranial Nerves. •407. The Cranial Nerves at the Base of the Skull. 2/3 natural size. The first of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves is the olfactory, Nervus olfactorius. It arises at the under surface of the anterior lobe from the Trigonum olfactorium as a flat, prismoid band, Tractus olfactorius, passes forwards in a deep groove on the under surface of the anterior lobe, converging- with that of the opposite side; on reaching the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone it expands into a mass of greyish-white substance, the olfactory bulb, Bulbus olfactorius. From the under part of this bulb are given off two rows of filaments, about 20 in number, which pass through the cribriform foramina to the upper part of the mucous membrane of the nose. Here they form a network at the Septum narium and inner surfaces of the ethmoidal tur- binated bones, from which very small filaments ascend to the mucous membrane. This network reaches clown furthest at the Septum narium (see Fig. 293), at the ethmoidal labyrinth only down to the lower border of the middle turbinated bone. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 1<Cranial Nerves. 124 V N. TRIGEMIK. 468. The Olfactory and Optic Nerves. View from above. The second pair of cranial nerves is the optic nerve, Nervus opticus; under the name of optic tract, Tractus opticus, it winds obliquely across the under surface of the Crus cerebri, from without inwards and downwards, converging with the nerve of the opposite side, to form with it in front of the Tuber cinereum the chiasm a or optic commis- sure. The greater number of the fibres of the two nerves decussate in the commissure, but some are continued from the tract to the nerve of the same side. The optic nerves, as they arise from the chiasma, are rounded cords, diverging from each other; each passes through the cor- responding optic foramen of the sphenoid bone to the orbit, and continues its oblique course, inclining at the same time somewhat downwards, to the eyeball, which it enters on its posterior aspect somewhat internal to its center. Here the nerve perforates the sclerotic and choroid coats and terminates by expanding in the retina. The fibrous layer of the retina is formed by the fibres of the optic nerve (see Fig. 307). The optic nerve is surrounded by a sheath from the dura mater, which finally becomes blended with the texture of the sclerotic.125 Cranial Nerves. 469. The Oculomotor, Trochlear and Abducent Nerves. View from above. The third pair of cranial nerves, the oculomoto r, Nervus oculo- motorius, emerges from the Crus cerebri close to the Pons Varolii, runs obliquely forwards and outwards, and becomes imbedded in the upper wall of the cavernous sinus (here it receives some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nerve). It then divides into two branches which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. The smaller superior division, Ramus superior, supplies the M. levator palpebrae saperioris and the M. rectus superior; the larger inferior, Ramus inferior, divides into three branches for the M. rectus interims, M. rectus inferior and M. obliquus inferior. From the latter, the longest branch, a short thick twig is given off to the ciliary ganglion, forming its inferior root, Radix brevis s. motoria. The fourth, trochlear or pathetic nerve, Nervus trochlearis s. patheticus, is the smallest of the cranial nerves. It arises immediately behind the Corpus quadrigeminum, winds around the Processus cerebelli ad corpus quadrigeminum and the Pcdunculus cerebri, pierces the dura mater behind the posterior clinoid process and is here united with the ophthal- mic division of the fifth nerve. It then enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and passes inwards to the M. obliquus superior. 17*Cranial Nerves. 126 470. The Oculomotor, Trochlear and Abducent Ne rves. View from the outside. The sixth nerve, the abducent, Nervusabducens, makes its appearance at the posterior border of the Pons Varolii, passes forwards through the cavernous sinus, in which it lies on the outer side of the internal carotid artery (Carotis cerebralis), and is joined by several filaments from the sympathetic. It then enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and passes between the two heads of the M. rectus externus, to be distri- buted to the muscle, which it pierces on its ocular surface. The fifth, trifacial or trigeminal nerve, Nervus trigeminus, the largest of the cranial nerves, arises by two separate roots. The larger, sensory, posterior root makes its appearance at the anterior surface of the Crus cerebelli ad pontem; the much smaller, motor, anterior root, between the anterior transverse fibres of the Pons Varolii. The two roots of the nerve pass forwards through an oval opening in the dura mater, Cavum Meckeln, at the superior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where the fibres of the sensory root form a large s e m i- lunar ganglion, the Ganglion Gasseri s. scmilunare. From the convex border of this ganglion the three large branches of the trifacial nerve pro- ceed : the I. ophthalmic branch, Bamus ophthalmicus, the II. s u p e- r i o r maxillary branch, Ramus supramaxillaris, and the III. inferior maxillary, Ramus inframaxillaris.Cranial Nerves. 127 471. The First Division (Ramus ophthalmicus) of the Trigeminal Nerve. The I. ophthalmic branch, the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth nerve, is a sensory nerve; it passes forwards and upwards along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, communicates with the sympathetic nerve and Nervus trochharis, and' gives off a recurrent filament, Ramus recurrens Arnold!, to the dura mater. Before its entrance into the sphenoidal fissure (Fissuva orhi- talis superior) it is divided into three branches; these are: a) The lachrymal, N. lacrymalis, which runs along the upper border of the external rectus muscle, gives off a twig to the orbital nerve and passes to the lachrymal gland, conjunctiva and skin at the outer canthus of the eye. b) The frontal, N. frontalis, situated below the roof of the orbit, divides into: the supratrochlear branch, which, running above the M. obliquus superior, leaves the orbit above the Trochlea to be distributed to the skin of the upper eyelid and the forehead; the supraorbital branch, which, usually divided into two twigs, passes through the supraorbital notch to the forehead, being distributed to the skin of the fore and upper parts of the scalp. c) The nasal or naso-ciliary, N. naso-ciliaris, lies at first on the outer side of the optic nerve, passes through the origin of the external rectus muscle with the abducens nerve, forms the long root of the ciliary gang- lion, Radix longa s. sensitiva Ganglii ciliaris (see Fig. 469), reaches the inner side of the optic nerve, giving off 1 — 2 ciliary nerves, and is finally divided into the ethmoidal nerve, which at first passes through the anterior ethmoidal foramen into the cranial cavity and then through the cribriform plate into the nasal cavity, supplying the Septum narium, external wall of nasal cavity, and finally the integument of the nose; and the infratrochlear nerve, passing below the Trochlea to the structures at the inner angle of the eye.128 Cranial Nerves. 472, The Second Division (Ramus supramaxillarisj of the Trigeminal Nerve. The II. superior maxillary branch, also sensory, leaves the skull through the Foramen rotunclum of the sphenoid bone, crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa and gives off the following branches: a) The orbital nerve, also called Nervus zijgomaticus s. sub- cutaneus malae, which enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure and divides into two branches: the temporal, Ramus temporalis; this receives a branch of communication from the lachrymal, and passing through the Canalis zijgomaticus temporalis enters the temporal fossa; at the anterior border of the temporal muscle it pierces the temporal fascia, and is distributed to the skin of the temple and side of the forehead; and the malar, Ramus malaris, which passes through the Canalis zijgomaticus facialis to the skin of the cheek; both communicate with the N. facialis. b) The superior dent a 1 or alveolar nerve, N. alueolaris superior. At the Tuber maxillare it divides into two branches, the first of which pierces the M. buccinator to be distributed to the mucous mem- brane of the mouth; the second passes through a Foramen maxillare superius into the upper dental canal, and runs forwards as posterior superior dental nerve to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum of Highmore and the pulp of the molar teeth. Finally it commu- nicates with the anterior superior dental nerve. c) The pterygo- or sp he no-palatine nerves, short nerves passing to the pterygo- or spheno-palatine ganglion. d) The infraorbital, Nervus infraorbitalis, is the direct con- tinuation of the superior maxillary nerve; it passes through the infra- orbital canal to the face and forms the Pes anserinus minor, whose twigs supply the skin of the lower eyelid, the cheek, nose and upper lip, and inosculate freely with the N facialis. One branch, the anterior superior dental nerve, forms the Ansa supramaxillaris and the Plexus dentalis.129 Cranial Nerves. 473. The Third Division (Ramus inframaxillarisj of the Trigeminal Nerve. The III. inferior maxillary branch, both sensory and motor, leaves the skull through the Foramen ovale of the sphenoid bone and divides immediately after, into two groups. The first, chiefly motor group divides into the following branches : a) The masseteric, Nervus massetericus, passes outwards through the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, enters the masseter and supplies it and the articulation of the jaw; b) The deep temporal, Nervi temporalis profundi, to the M. temporalis; c) The buccal or Nervus buccinatorius, to the M. buccinator ; d) The two pterygoid, Nervi ptcryrjoidci, an internal and an external for the two MM. pterygoidei. The second, chiefly sensory group, gives off thefollowingbranches: a) The auriculo-temporal, N. auriculo-temporalis s. temporalis super- ficial is; this arises by two roots, between which the middle meningeal artery (Art. mcningea media) (see Fig. 477) passes, and divides behind the condyle of the lower jaw into two branches, the posterior for the M. attrahens auriculae, the skin of the auricle and partly the external auditory meatus, and the anterior for the integument of the temporal region.Cranial Nerves. 130 474. The Lingual Nerve and the Submaxillary Ganglion. h) The gustatory or lingual nerve, Nervus lingualis, unites with the Chorda tympani and passes with it along the outer side of the M. styloglossus and M. hyo-glossus obliquely forwards and downwards; it sends branches to the Arcus palato-glossus, to the mucous membrane at the floor of the mouth, to the submaxillary ganglion and to the sub- lingual gland. Finally it is divided into from eight to ten lingual or terminal branches, which perforate the muscular structure of the tongue and terminate in the papillae (with the exception of the Papillae va/latac and many P. filiformes). c) The inferior dental nerve s. Nervus mandibular is, situated behind the N. lingualis, and connected with it by one or two filaments, passes along the outer side of the M. pterygoideus intemus to the inner opening of the inferior dental canal; its branches are: the m y 1 o - h y o i d, N. mylo-hyoideus, for the mylo-hyoid muscle and anterior belly of the digastric; the dental branches which supply the molar and bicuspid teeth together with the adjoining part of the gum; the incisor branch, which supplies filaments to the canine and incisor teeth; finally the mental branch, N. mentalis, which emerges from the bone by the mental foramen, and supplies the integument, mucous membrane and muscles of the lower lip.131 Cranial Nerves. 475. The Spheno-Palatine Ganglion, The largest ganglion of the trigeminal nerve is the Gasserian or semilunar g a n g 1 i o n, Ganglion Gasseri (see Fig. 47 l), somewhat crescentie in shape and formed only by the posterior sensory root of the fifth nerve. The ophthalmic, lenticular or ciliary ganglion, Gang- lion ciliare (see Fig. 469 and 470), about the size of a pin's head, is situated in the orbit between the external rectus muscle and the optic- nerve. Its roots are: the short root, Radix hrevis (motor) derived from the oculomotor nerve; the long root, Radix longa (sensory) derived from the nasal nerve, and the sympathetic root, Radix sympathica, from the carotid plexus. From the ciliary ganglion 10—1(3 ciliary nerves arise; they are disposed in two bundles, which pierce the sclerotic, pass between the latter and the choroid to the ciliary muscle, and supply this muscle, the iris and cornea. The s p h en o - p a 1 a t i n e or Meckel's ganglion, Ganglion xplicno-palatinum s. pterygo-palatinum (Meckelii), is deeply placed in the spheuo-maxillary fossa close to the spheno-palatine foramen, and is connected by a few short filaments (Nervi sphcno-palatini) with the II. division of the trigeminus. Its branches are: a) The ascending or orbital branches, Ramidi orbitales, which enter the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and supply the periosteum. H e i t z id a n ii, Atlas. II. ISCranial Nerves. 132 476. The Vidian Nerve after E. Bischoff. b) The Vidian nerve, Nervus Vidianus, consists of two bundles, composed of grey and white nerve fibres; it passes through the Vidian canal from before backwards, and divides at its posterior extremity into two. The grey bundle goes to or rather comes from the Plexus caroticus of the sympathetic, and is called the deep petrosal nerve, N. petrosus profundus; the white bundle forms the great superficial petrosal, N. petrosus superficialis major; this latter passes through the Fibrocartilago basilaris into the cranium, enters the Hiatus canalis Fallopiae and joins the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. c) The pharyngeal branches, Rami pharyngei, to the mucous membrane of the upper portion of the pharynx. d) The Ncrvi scptti narium to the upper wall of the posterior nares and Septum narium; the longest of these is called naso-palatine n e r v e, Nervus naso-palatinus Scarpae, and runs along the Septum narium to the Canalis naso-palatinus and through it to the hard palate and gums of the incisor teeth. e) The posterior nasal nerves, Ncrvi nasales posteriores, to the ethmoidal turbinated bones and the posterior parts of the outer wall of the nares. f) The descending palatine nerves, N. ijalatini dcscen- dentes, emerge through the posterior palatine foramina, and supply the hard and soft palate, the uvula, the M. levator palati and M. azygos uvulae. The largest of them, the anterior palatine, Nervus pal at inn* anterior, emerges upon the mucous membrane of the hard palate, and finally communicates with the N. naso-palatinus Scarpae.Cranial Nerves 133 V.

The supramaxillary ganglion, Ganglion swpramaxittare (Bochdalekii), is illustrated in Fig. 472; it is doubtful whether this really is a ganglion. The otic ganglion, Ganglion oticum (Arnoldi), lies below the Foramen ovale on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, con- nected with the nerve by a few filaments; it is pierced by the internal pterygoid nerve and its branch, which passes to the M. tensor palati mollis. Its branches are: a) Nerve to the tensor tympani, N. ad tensorem tympani; b) Small superficial petrosal nerve, N. petrosus super- ficialis minor; this nerve runs through a small canal in the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and with the great superficial petrosal nerve to the genu of the N. facialis, where it gives off a twig to the geniculate ganglion, and sends a second down to the tympanic cavity; this latter connects it with the N. Jaeobsonii (see Fig. 482) ; c) A small branch to the N. ad tensorem veli palatini; d) A small twig to the auricular branch of the auriculotem- poral nerve; e) A small branch from the Plexus sympathicus of the middle meningeal artery. The submaxillary or lingual ganglion, Ganglion sub- maxillare s. Unguale (see Fig. 474), is placed above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, near the lingual nerve, with which it is con- nected by several filaments. Its branches supply the submaxillar}' gland, and accompany the lingual nerve to the mucous membrane of the tongue. 18*134 Cranial Nerves. portio -—y INTERMED. -' WRISBERGII 478. The Portio intermedia Wrisbergii after E. Bischoff. The seventh or facial nerve, Nervus facialis, is the great motor nerve of the face. It arises from the lateral tract of the Medulla oblongata by two roots; the anterior root from the restiform body, the posterior as Portio intermedia of Wrisberg from the floor of the fourth ventricle. Both trunks lie in a groove of the auditory nerve, with which the Portio intermedia is connected. At the bottom of the internal auditory meatus the facial nerve leaves the auditory; it enters the Aquaeductus FaEopii and follows the windings of that canal; after having passed at first horizontally outwards, it bends sharply backwards, forming the genu; here it presents a reddish enlargement, the geniculate ganglion, Ganglion geniculi. This ganglion receives the great superficial petrosal nerve, and a twig of the small superficial petrosal, also filaments from the sympathetic plexus accompanying the middle meningeal artery. From the genu in the Aquaeductus Fallopii, the direction of the canal and the facial nerve lying in it, is backwards and finally downwards to the stylo- mastoid foramen. Behind the genu, two branches are given off from the facial nerve; the smaller, tympanic branch, leaves the facial trunk opposite the pyramid of the tympanic cavity, to supply the stapedius muscle (see Fig. 482 ); the larger, the Chorda tympani, leaves the trunk above the stylo- mastoid foramen, passes through a small canal, the Canalicidus chordae, into the tympanic cavity, then between the handle of the malleus and long- process of the incus to the Glaserian fissure, and finally unites with the lingual nerve, to which it supplies motor fibres.Cranial Nerves. 135 479. The Facial Nerve within the Petrous Bone. After the facial nerve has left the stylomastoid foramen, it gives off the following branches: a) The posterior auricular nerve, Nervus auricularis poste- rior profundus, which, inosculating with the auricular branch of the pneumogastiic and the small occipital nerve, supplies the M. retrahens auriculae, the M. occipitalis, and the posterior part of the occipito-frontalis muscle; b) The stylo- hyoid, N. stylo-Jiyoideus, and the posterior digastric, N. digastricus posterior; c) Communicating branches to the auriculotemporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The facial nerve then pierces the parotid gland, which, at the same time it supplies with very small filaments. Behind the ramus of the lower jaw it terminates by dividing into two parts, temp oro- facial and cervico-facial; these give off 8—10 branches, which, by communication, form the Pes anserinus major. The following groups are then formed: a) Temporal branches, Rami temporo-frontales; these commu- nicate with the auriculo-temporal nerve, the deep temporal nerves, the frontal and the lachrymal nerves, and supply the MM. attrahens and levator auriculae, the M. temporalis, the M. orbicularis palpebrarum and the M. cor- rugator supercilii. b) Malar branches, Rami zygomatics; these join with the N. zygomaticus malae, the lachrymal and supraorbital nerves, and supply the M. zygomaticus, M. orbicularis and M. levator labii superioris et alae nasi.Cranial Nerves. 136 480.

Both nerves enter the internal auditory meatus 5 the facial nerve passes to the Aquaeductus Fallopiac; the auditory nerve divides into two branches, the larger cochlear branch, N. cochleae, and the smaller vestibular branch, N. vcstibuli. The former passes forwards through the foramina of the Tractus foraminulentus to the Lamina spiralis, and ends in the organ of Corti; the latter divides into several branches, which pass to the Sacculus sphaericus, Sacculus ellipticiis and the three ampullae of the semicircular canals (see Fig. 325).138 Cranial Nerves. 482. The Nerve of Jacobson in the Tympanic Cavity. (Enlarged.) JRnmi ad Tub. Eustachii 482a. The Tympanic Plexus. After E. Bischoff. The ninth cranial nerve is the glosso - pharyngeal nerve, Nervtis glosso-pharyngeus. It passes through the jugular foramen in a separate sheath of the dura mater and forms here the jugular ganglion, Ganglion jugulare,' which is not constant; in the Fossii/a petvosa of the petrous bone is the petrous ganglion, Ganglion petroswn, always present, which communicates with the sympathetic nerve and the auricular branch of the pneumogastric. From this petrous ganglion, Jacobson's nerve, the tympanic branch of the ninth nerve, arises; this nerve runs forwards in the tympanic cavity, in a groove of the promontory, sends twigs to the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity and to the Eustachian tube, is united by means of the Nervi carotico-tympanid with the carotid plexus, and finally passes into the small superficial petrosal nerve. In the neck the glosso-pharyngeal nerve sends branches of communi- cation to the pneumogastric nerve, to the carotid plexus, and the digastric and stylo- hyoid branches of the facial nerve; also pharyn- geal branches to the muscles of the pharynx (see Fig. 486). Finally the nerve gives off lingual branches, which pass to the tongue and supply tbc Arcus glosso-palatinus, the tonsils, the anterior surface of the epiglottis and the root of the tongue, and finally end in the Papillae vallatae.139 Cranial Nerves. 483. Diagram of the Origin of the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Pairs of Cranial Nerves. The tenth pair of cranial nerves are the two pneumo- gastric nerves, Nervi vagi. Arising from the Medulla oblongata, the vagus passes out of the cranium through the jugular foramen, in com- pany with the glosso-pharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves. 1. The cervical portion presents in the jugular foramen the Ganglion jugulare, or ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric, which is connected with the first cervical ganglion, Ganglion cervic. primum (superius) of the sympathetic nerve; below the jugular ganglion the Vagus communicates freely with neighbouring nerves, and thereby the lower ganglion or ga-nglion of the trunk or Plexus nodosus about */2 inch in length, is formed; then the nerve descends between the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, into and through the thorax. Its branches are: a) Auricular b r a n c h, Ramus auricularis vagi, A r n o 1 d's n e r v e, which arises from the jugular ganglion; it receives a branch from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, passes outwards behind the jugular vein, reaches the Aquaeductus Fallopii, crosses the facial nerve, with which it is connected by two filaments, and passes through the Canaliculus mastoideus behind the pinna, where it partially communicates with the deep auricular branch of the facial nerve, partly supplies the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus.

The internal ramus always inosculates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the vagus. f) Filaments of communication to the descending ramus of the hypoglossal and the internal carotid plexus. g) Two to six cardiac branches to the cardiac plexus. 19*142 Cranial Nerves. 486.

Tlie thoracic portion of the vagus lies at first to the outer side of the common carotid artery; on the right side it crosses over the right sub- clavian artery, on the left side over the arch of the aorta; each nerve then passes behind the root of each lung, the right vagus passing behind the oeso- phagus, the left in front of it. The branches are: a) Inferior or recurrent laryngeal, Nervas laryngeus recurrens. The right (shorter) winds around the right subclavian artery, the left (longer) around the arch of the aorta; both nerves ascend in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus to the larynx, and supply its muscles. b) Anterior and posterior pulmonary or bronchial, Nervi broncliiales anteriores et posteriore.s. The former form with the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic the anterior pulmonary plexus, Plexus hronchialis anterior, the latter with branches of the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic the posterior pulmonary plexus, Plexus hronchialis posterior; they are distributed to the anterior and posterior aspects of the root of the lung. c) Oesophageal plexus, Plexus oesophagcus, at the anterior and posterior aspects of the oesophagus. 3. The abdominal portion of the vagus is formed by the twigs leaving the oesophageal plexus, which, by their communication, form the anterior and posterior gastric plexus, Plexus gastricus anterior et posterior, at the anterior and posterior aspects of the stomach; the former communicates with the hepatic plexus, the latter with the coeliac plexus, it sending filaments •to the spleen, pancreas, small intestines and kidney.143 Cranial Nerves.

It arises from the lateral tract of the spinal cord as low down as the sixth or seventh cervical vertebra by a number of filaments, passes through the Foramen magnum into the skull, leaves it with the pneumo- gastric by the jugular foramen and is divided into an anterior or accessory portion for the Plexus nodosus, and a posterior or spinal portion, which pierces the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle and terminates in the trapezius (M. cu- cullaris). The twelfth cranial or hypoglossal nerve, N. hypoglossal (motor) arises from the Medulla ohlongata, and leaves the skull by the anterior condyloid foramen. In the neck, where the nerve lies at first behind the vagus, internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, it curves forwards, then at the M. hyo- glossus upwards, and divides into branches at the posterior margin of the M. mylo- hjoideus, which supply all the muscles of the tongue. Beneath the anterior condyloid foramen it sends communicating branches to the first cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, to the Plexus nodosus of the vagus and to the upper cervical nerves, and somewhat lower the descendens noni branch, R. cervicales descendens, arises, which forms with branches of the second and third cervical nerves, the Ansa hy-poglossi.Spinal Nerves. 144 OommtesuTa media 488. Diagram of the Origins of the Spinal Nerves. The spinal nerves, Nervi spinales, are 31 pairs, and these are: 8 cervical, 12 dorsal, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 (very rarely 2) coccy- geal pairs. Each spinal nerve has two roots, an anterior, smaller, and a posterior, larger; they appear as flat fibrous bundles at the anterior and posterior margins of the lateral tract, pass through the interverte- bral foramen and unite to form a single rounded cord. The posterior root only, is marked by a ganglion, the Ganglion intervertebrale, formed in the intervertebral foramen. This root is sensory, the anterio r, motor. The single cord formed by the two roots divides again, into an anterior and a posterior division or branch, both of which receive motor, as well as sensory fibres. The anterior larger division communicates with the neighbouring sympathetic ganglion, and the neigh- bouring anterior divisions of the spinal nerves, whereby loops, Ansae, are formed, which are present everywhere except at the dorsal nerves, where they are not constant. These ansae unite to form plexuses, Plexus cervlcalis, lumbalis and sacralis. The posterior divisions, irregularly united with the neighbouring branches, pass backwards to the muscles and skin of the back ; they, however, supply only the long- muscles of the back, the broad muscles being supplied by nerves from the plexus of the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves.145 Spinal Nerves. 489. The Cervical Portion of the Spinal Cord with its Membranes. View from behind. The spinal cord extends only to the first or second lumbar vertebra. The length of the roots of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerves therefore, increases rapidly from nerve to nerve, and may be estimated by the distance of the foramen of exit from the extremity of the cord; owing to their length and the appearance they present in connection with the spinal cord, the aggregation of the roots of these nerves has been named horse's tail, Cauda equina. At the Conus terminalis of the spinal cord the pia mater is continued as FUwm tcrminale, down to the lower end of the impervious sheath of the dura mater, which runs down to the end of the sacral canal. The intervertebral ganglia of the cervical, dorsal and lumbar nerves lie within the intervertebral foramina; those of the sacral nerves in the spinal canal external to the dura mater; those of the coccygeal nerve within the latter. The largest nervous divisions of the spinal cord are the sacral nerves, which form the sacral ple- xus, Plexus sacrah's.Spinal Nerves. 146 Co 71 US XXX N SACR 5 Fit. termirt 490.

The first cervical nerve emerges be- tween the occipital bone and atlas as sub- occipital nerve; the eighth through the intervertebral foramen between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebra. The anterior divisions of the cervical nerves pass in front of or between the bundles of the M. scalenus medius and M. levator scapulae, forwards and outwards; the four upper form the cervical plexus, Plexus cervicalis, the four lower with the greater portion of the first, dorsal, the brachial plexus, Plexus brachialis. — The poste- rior division of the first cervical nerve, the infraoccipital nerve, supplies the posterior straight and oblique muscles of the head, the M. biventer cervicis and M, complexus. The posterior division of the second cervical nerve supplies the muscles of the neck (with the exception of the trapezius), and passes as great occi- pital nerve, N. occipitalis magnus, to the skin at the back of the head. The branches of the cervical plexus are: 1. Three or four filaments to the upper cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nerve. 2.

Diagram of the Supra- and Infraclavicular Portions of the Brachial Plexus. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four lower cervical nerves and the greater part of the first dorsal. The manner iu which the nerves are disposed in the plexus, is liable to a great deal of variation, the more frequent arrangement, however, is the following: the fifth and sixth cervical nerves join together to form an upper trunk, the eighth cervical and first dorsal unite to form a lower trunk, while the seventh cervical forms by itself a middle trunk. Soon after passing the outer border of the scaleni muscles, each trunk divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branches of the upper and middle trunks unite together to form the upper or outer cord of the plexus; the anterior branch of the lower trunk forms by itself the lower or inner cord, and the posterior branches of all three trunks unite to form the middle or posterior cord. Sometimes the nerves blend so as to form only two principal trunks, from which the three cords are given off. The brachial plexus is divided into a supraclavicular and an infra- clavicular portion, Pars supra- et Pars infraclavicularis. The former lies in the Fossa supraclavicularis, and its branches, besides those for the MM. scaleni and M. longus colli, are the following:Spinal Nerves. 149 493.

Lesser internal cu- taneous, N. cutaneus bracliii in- terims, arises from the inner cord, passes down behind the axillary vein, communicates with a branch of the second dorsal nerve, the inter c osto - humeral, pierces the fascia of the upper arm at the inner surface, and is distributed to the integument of the arm down to the elbow-joint. 2. Internal cutaneous, N. cutaneus brachii medius arises from the inner cord, runs on the in- ner side of the axillary, then the ba- silic vein, pierces with the latter the fascia of the upper arm, and divides into two branches, an an- terior, i?. cutaneus palmaris, and a posterior, E. cutaneus ulnar is. The anterior descends on the an- terior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm, distributing filaments to the integument as far as the wrist, the posterior passes down- wards on the inner side of the basilic vein at the ulnar side of the forearm and communicates with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve; it distributes fila- ments to the integument on the inner and posterior surfaces of the forearm.Spinal Nerves. 151 3. External or musculo- cutaneous, N. cutaneus bracliii cxternus s. musculo-cutaneus arises from the outer cord of the bra- chial plexus. It perforates the M. coraco-braclrialis, passes ob- liquely between M. biceps and M. brachialis anticus to the elbow, where it pierces the fascia of the upper arm, accompanies the cephalic vein to the back of the hand and communicates with the dorsal branch of the radial nerve. It supplies the MM. coraco-bra- chialis, biceps and brachialis anticus, and the integument on the radial side of the forearm. 4. Circumflex, N. circum- flexus s. axillaris, arises from the posterior cord of the plexus, and winds around the neck of the humerus in company with the posterior circumflex artery; it supplies the capsule of the shoul- der-joint; with a cutaneous branch the posterior region of the shoul- der and upper arm; with muscu- lar branches the M. teres minor and M. dcltoides (see Fig. 499). 5. Median nerve, N. me- dianus, arises by two roots, one from the outer and one from the inner cord of the brachial ple- xus ; these embrace the lower part of the axillary artery (see Fig- 493). It descends in the Sulcus bicipitalis interims, lying at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, then crosses the vessel above the elbow and lies to its inner side, and beneath the M. pronator radii teres and M. flexor carpi radialis, to within two inches above the annular liga- ment, where it becomes more super - 495.

The first supplies the small muscles of the thumb and the skin on its radial side; the other three supply the first three MM. lumbricales, and the inte- gument on the contiguous sides of the thumb, and the second, third and fourth fingers. One branch communicates with the volar branch of the ulnar nerve. In the upper arm the median nerve has no branches; in the forearm: muscular branches for the superficial flexor muscles (except M. flexor carpi ulnaris); a communicating branch for the external cutaneous nerve; also the anterior or internal interosseous, N. mterosseus interims, which passes down to the M. pronator quadratics; finally a palmar cutaneous branch, N. cutaneus antibrachii palmaris (see Fig. 494).Spinal Nerves. 153 407. The Nerves at tlie Palmar Side of the Hand. 6. Ulnar nerve, jV. ulnaris, arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, lies at first to the inner side of the axillary artery and vein, pierces the internal intermuscular septum, passes down between the inner condyle of the humerus and olecranon, then between the two heads of the M. flexor carpi ulnaris, runs between it and 21. flexor digitorum profundus, and passes on the inner side of the ulnar artery to the wrist. It supplies the 21. flexor carpi ulnaris and inner half of the 21. flexor profundus digitorum and with a cutaneous branch, the ulnar side of the forearm. Above the wrist it divides into a dorsal and palmar branch, JR. dorsalis and R. volaris. The dorsal branch passes to the back of the hand, pierces the fascia and divides into five digital branches, Nervi digitorum dorsales, which supply both sides of the little and ring fingers and the ulnar side of the middle finger, down to the second phalanges. The palmar branch passes by the side of the pisiform bone above the annular ligament into the palm of the hand and divides into a superficial and a deep branch, R. superficialis and B. profundus. The former sends branches to the ulnar side of the little finger, and adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers; the latter supplies the muscles of the little finger, the 2121. inlerossei, the 21. lum- bricalis IV, Adductor pollicis and inner head of the 21. flexor brevis pollicis.Spinal Nerves. 154 498.

At first it lies behind the axillary artery, winds round the back of the humerus, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, between the external and internal heads of the M. triceps; it pierces the external intermuscular septum and descends between the M. brachialis anticus and M. supinator longus to the front of the external condyle; its muscular branches supply the MM. triceps, anconaeus, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brachialis anticus. It sends cutaneous branches to the inner and extensor surfaces of the upper- and forearm. It ends by dividing into two branches: a) The radial nerve lies a little to the outer side of the radial artery, concealed beneath the M. supinator longus; a few inches above the wrist it pierces the deep fascia and divides into two branches, an external, smaller, sup- plying the integument of the radial side and ball of the thumb, and an inter- nal, larger, whose branches supply the adjoining sides of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and, with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve, the contiguous sides of the middle and ring fingers. b) The posterior interosseous nerve, passes through the fibres of the M. supinator brews to the outer side of the forearm; its muscular branches supply the MM. extensor carpi radialis brevior, supinator brevis, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the 3 extensors of the thumb and the extensor indicis. It also sends the R. interosseous externus down to the capsule of the wrist-joint. * This nerve is sometimes known as the radial nerve; its terminal branches are then called the superficial (radial) and the deep (posterior interosseous).155 Spinal Nerves. I N- SUPRA- SCAPULAR. N. AXILLAR. Of the twelve dorsal nerves, Nervi dor sales s. thoracici, the first passes out of the intervertebral fora- men between the first and second dorsal vertebrae, the twelfth between the last dorsal and first lum- bar. Immediately after their exit they divide into lar- ger, anterior, and smaller, posterior divisions. The posterior divisions di- vide into internal and exter- nal branches; both supply the muscles and skin of the back. The anterior di- visions, the intercostal nerves, Nervi intercostales, pass forwards in the inter- costal spaces, each giving off a lateral cutaneous b r a n c h, N. cutaneus pecto- ralis lateralis. The upper six lateral cutaneous branches divide again into anterior and posterior, Nervi cu- tanei laterales pectoris ante- riores et posteriores, the for- mer to the integument of the chest and mamma, the latter to the integument of the back. Afterhavinggiven off the lateral cutaneous branches, the intercostal nerves con- tinue their course forwards, supply the intercostal muscles, pierce the M. pectoralis major near the sternum, and are lost as anterior cuta- neous nerves of the chest, Nervi cutanei pectoris anterio- res, in the integument of the mamma and front of the chest. The anterior bran- ches of the six lower lateral cutaneous nerves pass to the anterior abdominal wall, the posterior to the skin of the back as Nervi cutanei laterales abdominis anteriores et posteriores.

The p o s t e r i o r, smaller branches supply the fol- lowing muscles: Erector spinae, Inter transver sales, Mvltifidus spi- nae and Inter spinalcs, and the skin of the lumbar and gluteal regions. The anterior, larger branches form the lumbar plexus, Plexus lumbalis, which gives off the following branches: 1. Ileo-hypogastric, N. ileo - hypogastrics, mixed nerve, arises from the first lumbar nerve, and supplies the MM. transversus abdominis and obliquus interims. Between trans- versalis and internal oblique muscles it divides into two branches, the iliac, R. iliacus, to the integument of the glu- teal region, and the hypo- gastric, i?. hypogastrics, to the hypogastric region. 2. Ileo-inguinal, N. ileo- inguinalis, sensory, also arises from the first lumbar nerve, per- forates the M. transversus ab- dominis above Poupart's liga- ment, passes into the inguinal canal and terminates in the in- tegument of the scrotum and upper and inner part of the thigh in the male, and in the labium in the female, with the Nervi scrotales et labiales ante- mi.

External cutaneous, N. cutaneus femoris anterior externus, from the second and third lum- bar nerves, pierces the Fascia lata beneath the anterior superior spine of the ilium and sends branches to the outer side of the thigh as far down as the knee. 5. Obturator, N. obtura- torius, from the second, third and fourth lumbar nerves, passes through the obturator foramen, supplies the M. obturator externus, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch goes to the M. obturator externus and M. adductor magnus; the ante- rior branch to the M. gracilis, M. adductor longus and brevis, pier- ces the Fascia lata, and sends filaments along the inner surface of the thigh, as far down as the knee-joint. 4503. The Anterior Crural Nerve. 6. Anterior era r a 1, N. cruralis (ftmoralis), arises from the loop between the second, third and fourth lumbar nerves, and is the largest nerve of the lum- bar plexus. It passes be- tween the M. psoas and M. iliacus interims through the Lacuna muscularis to the thigh and divides into cu- taneous and muscular branches. The former are : a) The middle cu- taneous, N. cufaneus fe- moris medius, perforates the M. sartorius and passes to the middle of the anterior surface of the thigh. b) The internal c ut a- neous, N. cutaneus femoris interims, pierces the Fascia lata in the middle of the thigh, communicates with the anterior branch of the ob- turator nerve, and passes to the inner side of the thigh. c) The long or inter- nal saphenous, N. saphe- nous major, passes down with the femoral artery to the opening in the adductor tendon, and runs between M. vastus interims and M. adductor magnus to the in- ner side of the knee-joint. Behind the tendon of the sartorius it passes through the Fascia lata and accom- panies the internal saphe- nous vein down to the foot. It gives off the N. cutaneus surae internns to the calf of the leg, passes to the inner border of the foot, where it supplies the inte- gument and communicates with the internal branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve.

The Great Sciatic Nerve The museularbran- ches of the anterior cru- ral nerve supply the muscles on the front of the thigh, with the excep- tion of the adductors and gracilis. The five sacral nerves, Kervi sacral'es, are the largest of the spinal nerves, the coccy- geal nerve, however, the small est. The posterior divisions of these nerves pass through the posterior sacral foramina and Hiatus sacro-coccygeus, and unite to form the Plexus sacratis posterior, which supplies cutaneous branches to the sacral and coccygeal regions. The large, anterior di- visions pass through the anterior sacral foramina and the Foramen sacro- coccygeum, and form the Plexus sacro-coccygeus. The Plexus sacro-coc- cygeus divides into the Ple- xus ischiadicus, pudenda-Ms and coccygeus. The Plexus ischiadicus and pudendalis are usually classified un- der the name of the s a- cral plexus. The bran- ches of the Plexus ischia- dicus (of the sacral plexus with the exception of the pudic nerve and its bran- ches) within the pelvis, are muscular filaments supplying the M. pyri- formis and M. obturator interims. Outside of the pelvis the branches are following:161 Spinal Nerves. 1. The superior gluteal, N. glutaeus superior, which pas- ses through the great sacro- sciatic foramen above the pyri- formis muscle and sends fila- ments to the M. glutaeus me- dius, minimus and M. tensor vaginae femoris. 2. The inferior glu- teal, N. glutaeus inferior, passes through the great saero- sciatic foramen below the pyri- formis muscles and supplies the M. glutaeus maximus. 3. The small sciatic s. N. cutaneus femoris posterior, also passes below the pyri- formis to the buttock, and sends branches partly above the lower border of the M. glu- taeus maximus to the skin of the buttock, partly to the pos- terior side of the thigh. 4. The great sciatic s. JV. ischiadicus, passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle to the gluteal region, supplies the MM. gemelli, obturator inter- ims and quadratics femoris, and passes between the great tro- chanter and tuberosity of the ischium to the back of the thigh.

The great sciatic nerve divides at a varying point into two branches, which, in the pop- liteal space are known as the external and internal popliteal, further down are called the peroneal and posterior tibial nerves. 1. The external pop- liteal or peroneal nerve descends to the fibula, and sends off articular branches to the knee-joint and cuta- neous branches, the N. cuta- nens surae externus et medius to the skin. It then divides into two branches, a superficial, the musculo-cutaneous, and a deep, the anterior tibial, a) The musculo-cuta- neous branch, (N. peroneus superficialis) passes forwards be- tween the MM.peronei and exten- sor longus digitorum, pierces the deep fascia and is finally divided into an external branch, N. cutaneus pedis dorsalis medius, communicating with the short saphenous nerve, and an inter- nal, N. cutaneus pedis dorsalis interims, communicating with the great saphenous nerve. They form the seven dor- sal nerves of the toes (Fig. 507). b) The anterior tibial branch (N. peroneus profundus) passes forwards to the fore part of the interosseous membrane, and gives off muscular branches for the MM. tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, peroneus tertius and -M. peron.

It divides into an external branch for the M. extensor digitorum hrevis and an internal branch, which, communicating with the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, supplies the adjacent sides of the large and second toe. 2. The internal popliteal, N. poplitem internus, descends along the back of the thigh through the middle of the popliteal space, to the lower part of the M. popliteus, where it passes with the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial. Its branches are the external or short saphenous nerve, N. suralis or N. com- municans poplitei which receives a communicating branch from the exter- nal popliteal nerve and is distributed to the integument along the outer Heitzmann, Atlas.

The two Plantar Nerves. side of the foot and little toe, and at the dorsum of the foot is called JV. cutaneus pedis dorsalls extemus, and muscular branches to the MM. gastrocnemius, plantaris, soleus and popliteus. The posterior tibial nerve, JV. tibialis posticus, lies at first to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery, which it soon crosses and then lies to its outer side as far as the ankle. In the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, it divides into the external and internal plantar nerves. Its muscular branches supply the MM. tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. a) The internal plantar, JV. plantaris interims, lies between M. ab- ductor pollicis and M. flexor digitorum brcvis; it divides into seven plantar digital nerves, Nervi digitales plantares, distributed to both sides of the three inner toes and to the inner side of the fourth toe.165 Spinal Nerves. 509. The Deep Branch of the External Plantar Nerve. b) The external plantar, JV. plantaris extemus, lies between MM. flexor brevis digitorum and flexor accessorius, and is divided into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial separates into three digital branches, which supply the little and outer side of the fourth toes; this branch communicates with the internal plantar nerve. The deep or muscular branch accompanies the external plantar artery and supplies all the interossei (except those in the fourth meta- tarsal space), the two outer lumbricales, the Adductor potticis and the Transversus pedis muscles. 22*166 Spinal Nerves. 510. The Branches of the Plexus pudendalis. The Plexus pudendalis, lying at the lower border of the M. pyri- formis, gives off the following branches: 1. The middle and inferior h a e m o r r h o i d a 1 nerves, N. haemorrhoidalis medius et inferior, which, communicating with each other and the pelvic plexuses of the sympathetic, supply the base of the bladder, the vagina, the M. levator and sp>liincter ani ext. et int. 2. The pudic nerve, N. pudendus, leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen and reenters it through the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen; it gives off two terminal branches: a) The perineal nerve, N. perinealis, which passes to the peri- naeum and supplies the integument, the MM. transversi perin., accelerator urinae (bulbo-cavernosus) and spliinctcr ani ext., and the scrotum (Nervi scrotales posteriores); in the female it supplies the labia and Yestibulum vaginae (Nervi labiales posteriores). b) The dorsal nerve of the penis, N. penis dorsalis, which passes between MM. accelerator urinae and erector penis beneath the pubic symphisis, from there to the penis; in the female to the clitoris. The Plexus coccygeus ends in the M. sphincter ani ext., levator ani and in the skin of the anus.511. The Right Sympathetic Nerve.168 Sympathetic Nerves. V N. TR1GEM1M. 512. The Communication of the Carotid Plexus with some of the Cranial Nerves. After Eiidinger. The sympathetic nerve, N. sympatheticus, consists of a series of ganglia, connected together by intervening cords, and of a number of plexuses. The cervical portion of the sympathetic, Pars cermcalis N. sympathici, consists of three ganglia on each side. The superior is the largest, the middle is sometimes absent, the inferior is fre- quently joined with the first thoracic ganglion. The latter gives off the inferior cardiac nerve, N. cardiacus inferior, to the deep cardiac plexus, the middle gives off the middle cardiac, N. cardiacus medius. The thoracic portion of the sympathetic, Pars thoracica N. sympathici, consists of eleven thoracic ganglia, which communicate with each other and with the intercostal nerves; they strengthen the thoracic plexuses. The first thoracic ganglion gives off the N. cardiacus imus to the cardiac plexus. The two splanchnic nerves, Nervi splanchnici, pass to the plexuses of the abdomen. The lumbo-sacral portion of the sympathetic, Pars lumbo-sacralis N. sympathici has four or five lumbar ganglia, Ganglia lumbalia, and the same number of sacral ganglia, Ganglia sacralia, which are connected with the lumbar nerves. They supply the plexuses of the abdomen, the Ganglia sacrcdia also the Plexus hypogastrics inferior. At the coccyx, the two gangliated cords converge, and are connected by means of a loop, in which a single ganglion, Ganglion coccygeum impar, is found. The plexuses of the sympathetic nerve are formed not only by the sympathetic, but also by the cranial and spinal nerves. The cranial plexuses are: the Plexus caroticus interims (called in the cavernous sinus: Plexus cavernosus) and the Plexus caroticus externus.169 Sympathetic Nerves. 513. The Pelvic Plexuses of the Sympathetic Nerve in the female. The cervical plexuses surround the arteries of the neck and are called Plexus laryngeus, tliyreoideus inferior and vertebralis. The thoracic plexuses belong partly to the vascular system: Plexus cardiacus and aorticus, partly to the lungs and oesophagus: Plexus puhnonalis and oesopliageus. The abdominal and pelvic plexuses are: Solar plexus, Plexus epigastricus s. Solaris, the largest plexus, which supplies all the viscera in the abdominal cavity, situated behind the stomach and in front of the aorta and crura of the diaphragm; it receives both splanchnic nerves coming out of the thorax; the phrenic, suprarenal, renal, superior mesenteric, spermatic and inferior mesenteric plexuses; then the aortic, abdominal and inferior hypo- gastric plexuses out of which latter the uterine, vesical and cavernous plexuses are given off in the female.

The heart is contained in a conical, membranous sac, the Peri- cardium, the apex of which is directed upwards and surrounds the great ves- sels, the base of which is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm. The pericardium consists of an external and an internal layer; the former has the structure of fibrous, the latter of serous membranes. The serous layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium • it consists, therefore, of a visceral and a parietal portion. The fibrous layer is continued above for some distance along the large blood-vessels in the form of tubular prolongations, which become gradually lost upon their external coats.Topography. 175 517. Topography of the Thoracic Viscera. The pericardium is covered in front by the pleurae and the mar- gins of the lungs, behind it rests upon the bronchi, oesophagus and descending aorta. After opening of the pericardium a part of the large vessels is found enclosed in its cavity. The aorta, the superior vena cava, the four pulmonary veins and the right and left divisions of the pulmonary artery, receive each an investment from the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The space between heart and pericardium contains a small quantity of Liquor Pericardii.518. The Heart and Large Vessels. View from before, */2 natural size. The heart, Cor, is a hollow, muscular organ of a conical form, which projects further into the left than into the right half of the chest, and lies between the concave surfaces of the lungs. It consists of a base, directed upwards, backwards and to the right, and of an apex, directed downwards, forwards and to the left; also of a convex anterior surface, a flattened posterior surface and two lateral bor- ders. Two longitudinal sulci, situated one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface, divide the heart into a right and a left half; these sulci are continuous one with the other a little to the right of the apex; the anterior is nearer to the left and the posterior nearer to the right side of the heart. Both halves are again divided by a deep transverse groove, which is plainly visible only at the posterior surface of the heart.177 Heart. Carotissin. 519. The Heart and Large Vessels. View from behind, */2 natural size. Up to the fourth month of embryonic life the position of the heart is a vertical one; in the adult it is placed obliquely, the long axis of the heart forming with that of the body an angle of about 50°. The base of the heart is situated between the second and third left ribs and extends to the interspace between fourth and fifth right costal cartilages; its apex lies behind the anterior extremities of the left fifth and sixth ribs. The long axis of the heart is therefore placed obliquely from right to left from above downwards, and the base is further posterior than the apex.178 Heart. Vcoronaria 520, Horizontal Section through the Heart (Vertically to the long axis of the body.) The heart is divided by a muscular septum into two halves, each of which is again subdivided into an upper cavity, the auricle*, Auri- cula, and a lower cavity, the ventricle, Ventriculus. The partition between the ventricles is called Septum ventriculorum, that between the auricles, Septum auriculorum. Each ventricle is triangular in form, the walls of the left considerably thicker than those of the right. The mus- cular columns which project from nearly the whole of the inner surfaces of the ventricles, are called Columnae cameae; those which run across the inner surface of the Appendix auriculae, and adjoining portion of the wall of the sinus, Musculi pectinati. Into the right auricle the Venae cavae and coronary sinus open, into the left the four pulmonary veins. Each auricle communicates with the corresponding ventricle by means of the auriculo-ventricular orifice, Ostium auriculo-ventriculare s. venosum; the ventricles open into the arteries which arise from them, each by means of an Ostium arteriosum, the right into the pulmonary artery by means of the opening for the pul- monary artery, the left into the aorta, by means of the aortic opening. All openings have valves; between auricles and ventricles are the Valvulae auri- culo-ventricular es, between ventricles and arteries the Valvulae semicircular es. * The principal cavity or sinus of the auricle is often known as the atrium, to dis- tinguish it from the auricular appendix, which is called auricle proper, Auricula.Heart. 179 521. The Right Heart, laid open. The right auriculo-ventricular orifice is guarded by the tricus- pid valve, Talvula tricuspidalis; the left by the mitral or b i c u s- pid valve, Yalvula hicuspidalis. One- set of the Cohimnae cameae are the MuscuM papillaris, which are connected at their base with the ven- tricular wall, and by the other end are attached to small tendinous c o r d s, Chordae tcndineac, through which they are connected with the segments of the auriculo-ventricular valve. The semilunar valves, Valvulae semilunares, three in number on each side, guard the orifices of the aorta and pulmonary artery; they are attached by their convex margins, to the wall of each artery, at its junction with the ventricle, the straight border being free. The free margin of each presents at its middle, a small projecting fibro- cartilaginous nodule, Kodidus s. Corpus Arantii, which is especially marked at the semilunar valve of the aorta. The internal surfaces of all the cavities of the heart are lined by the Endocardium, which is a thin, connective tissue membrane covered with endothelium. Heitzmanu, Atlas.

The r i g h t auricl e, Auricula dextra, occupies the right and anterior portion of the base of the organ. Its right or outer wall is the smallest, the left wall is formed by the Septum auricularum. At the posterior half of the septum is the Fossa ovalis, whose floor is thin and translucent; it is bounded above and at the sides by a prominent border, deficient below, the Annulus ovalis s. Ldmbus foraminis ovalis s. Isthmus Vieussenii (see Fig. 521). In the heart of the embryo, the Fossa ovalis is a foramen, Foramen ovale; the blood flowing from the inferior Vena cava into the right auricle, mostly arterial, is guided by a semilunar projection, the Eustachian valve, to the Foramen ovale, through which the greater part passes to the left auricle. The inferior Vena cava opens at the posterior wall of the right auricle, the superior Vena cava at the upper wall. The right Appendix auriculae projects forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the aorta. The under part of the right auricle is occupied by the auricular-ventricular orifice, which leads into the right ventricle.181 Heart. 523. The Opening of the Coronary Vein into the Right Auricle. View from behind. After a dried specimen, natural size. In the right auricle there is also the coronary valve or Valvula Thebesii, a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, protecting the orifice of the coronary sinus. The Foramina Thebcsii are numerous minute apertures, the mouths of small veins, which open on various parts of the inner surface of the auricle. The Eustachian valve is a crescentic fold of the lining membrane, which is an important structure in the foetal heart, serving the purpose of directing the stream of blood from the inferior Vena cava through the Foramen ovale into the left auricle. Its convex margin is attached to the wall of the Vena cava, its free concave margin terminates in two cornua, of which the left is attached to the anterior edge of the Anaulus ovalis. The Tuberculum Loweri is not visible in the hearts of adults; it is a small projection on the right wall of the auricle between the two Venae cavae. Both the coronary valve and the Eustachian valve may be found fenestrated. 24*182 Heart. 524. The Left Heart, laid open. The left auricle, Auricula sinistra, has opening into it tbe four pulmonary veins, two into the right and two into the left side.

The right ventricle, Ventriculus dexter, is separated from the left by the Septum ventriculorum. The auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the tricuspid valve, Valvula tricuspidalis, which consists of three seg- ments or flaps, an anterior, a posterior and an internal, of which the anterior is the largest. These segments are connected by their bases to the auriculo- ventricular orifice, and by their sides with one another, their free margins and ventricular surfaces giving attachment to a number of Chordae tendineae. The arterial opening is at the left side of the base of the ventricle, and leads into the pulmonary artery; the conical prolongation from which it is given off is called Ccmus arteriosus (see Fig. 52l). The three semi- lunar valves at the orifice of the pulmonary artery are divided into an anterior, a right and a left; their Noduli Arantii are often very small.183 Heart. 525, The Left Ostium auriculo-ventriculare s. venosum and arteriosus, from above.

Its auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the bicuspid or mitral valve, Valvula bicns- pidalis s. mitralis, which consists of an anterior and a posterior segment. Of the semilunar valves surrounding the orifice of the aorta, one is placed to the right, one to the left and one posteriorly; they are stronger and thicker than those of the pulmonary artery, and the Noduli Arantii are larger and more prominent. During the diastole the auricles and ventricles of the heart are filled with blood, which, during the systole is again driven out. The systole of both auricles is, as well as that of the ventricles, synchronous, and the latter follows the former after a very short interval. During the diastole the right heart is filled by the venous blood from the Venae cavae and coronary veins, and during the systole it drives the blood into the pulmonary artery. The left heart is filled during the diastole with the arterial blood from the four pulmonary veins, and during the systole drives the blood into the aorta.184 Arteria pulmonalis.

The pulmonary artery, Arteria pulmonalis, arises from the right ventricle; at the concavity of the aortic arch it divides into a right and a left branch. The right, longer branch passes behind the ascending aorta and superior Vena cava to the root of the right lung. The left, smaller branch passes in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung; it is connected with the concave portion of the aortic arch by means of a short, fibrous cord, which corresponds to the obsolete Ductus arteriosus Botalli of the embryo. In the root of the lung, the right and left pulmonary arteries, both lie in front of the bronchus and behind the veins. On the right side the bronchus is highest and the veins lowest, while on the left side the bronchus sinks to a level between the artery and veins.Aorta. 185 A.coronar. \ ) \^ dextra. rA.coronar.sin,. V.dextra Valu.post The aorta, the main trunk of the arterial system, arises from the upper part of the left ven- tricle of the heart, with an en- largement, the Bidbus Aortac. It is divided into the arch of the aorta, thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta. The arch of the aorta extends from the origin of the vessel to the lower border of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra ; it at first ascends obliquely upwards and to the right side as ascending aorta, then passes transversely from right to left, and from before back- wards as transverse aorta, and then descends upon the left side of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra, being there called descending aorta. The two coronary arte- ries arise from the ascending por- tion of the arch of the aorta, in the upper parts of two of the sinuses of Valsalva, on a level with the margins of the semilunar valves. The left, Arteria coronaria sinistra, is usually larger than the right; it passes behind and then to the left side of the pulmonary artery and divides into two branches; of these one passes transversely outwards in the left auriculo-ventricular groove and anastomoses with the superior branch of the right coronary, the other descends to the apex of the heart, where it anastomoses with the descen- ding branch of the right coronary. The right, Arteria coronaria dextra, passes forwards to the right side in the right auriculo-ventricular groove, curves backwards and divides into two branches, one of which descends c. along the posterior interventricular furrow to the apex of the heart. From the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta (often simply called Amis Aortae) three large vessels arise; they are: the innominate artery, Art. anonyma, the left common caro- t i d, Carotis sinistra, and the left subclavian, Art. subclavia sinistra. The innominate artery passes obliquely upwards and to the right in front of the trachea, and divides behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation into the right subclavian and right common carotid arteries. The left carotid and left subclavian arteries are therefore longer and placed more deeply in the thorax, than 527.

Diagram of the Varieties of the Branches arising from the Transverse Arch by Abnormal Ramification. The variations in the origins of the vessels arising from the trans- verse arch of the aorta can take place in three different ways: the number of branches either diminishing, or increasing, or there being the normal number but an abnormal ramification. The diminution can take place in the following ways: a) two innominate arteries; b) the left carotid is a branch of the innominate; c) all the branches are united to form a single anterior aorta. The augmentation consists in the following varieties: a) the left vertebral artery arises between carotid and left subclavian; b) an Art. thyreoidca ima arises between innominate and left carotid; c) an internal mammary artery or Art. thymica arises from the anterior wall of the transverse arch; d) the innominate is not pre- sent and all branches arise separately. The abnormal ramification may take place in two ways: a) both carotids unite to form one innominate; b) the left caro- tid arises from the innominate, and the left vertebral artery arises alone.Carotis externa. 189 R.post R.ant.

The external carotid is covered by the Platysma myoides, by the superficial layer of the cervical fascia and the facial vein, passes ^ into the substance of the parotid gland and behind the condyle of the lower jaw, and divides into two terminal branches: the temporal, Art. temporalis superficialis, and i n t e I'- ll a 1 maxillary, Art. maxillaris interna. From the anterior portion of the external carotid arise: a) The superior thyroid, Art. tliyreoidea superior, which curves downwards and forwards in an arched and tortuous manner to the thyroid gland. It gives off the superior laryngeal, Art. laryngea superior, which pierces the thyro-hyoid mem- brane and supplies the muscles, mucous membrane and glands of the larynx and epiglottis; also mus- cular branches. (See Fig. 532, 533. In Fig. 533 — the original was a dried specimen — the superior laryngeal artery appears as if pushed out of its position; it must be imagined as running in the Swims piriformis.) b) The lingual artery, Art. lingualis, arises opposite the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and passing between the M. hyo-glossus and M. constrictor pharyngis medius, reaches the tongue. Its branches are the hyoid, Ramus liyoideus; the Art. dorsalis linguae to the mucous mem- brane of the dorsum of the tongue; the sublingual, Art. sublingualis, to the floor of the mouth. The continuation of the lingual artery is called r a nine artery, Art. ranina or Art. profunda linguae (see Fig. 541). It communicates with the artery of the other side only by means of capillaries. 25* 531. Diagram of the Rami- fications of the External Carotid.190 Carotis externa. 532.

Its branches are: the submental, Art. suhmentaHs; the ascending palatine, Art. palatina ascendens s. pharyngo- palatina, which lies at the side of the pharynx and supplies the MM. stylo- glossus and stylo-pharyngeus, the soft palate and the mucous membrane of the pharynx; the tonsillar artery, Art. tonsillaris, to the side of the pharynx and the tonsil ; the submaxillary; muscular branches to the internal pterygoid, masseter and buccinator muscles; the inferior labial; the superior and inferior coronary, Art. coronaria labii superioris et inferioris, which, run along the edges of the lips and anastomose with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side. From the upper arch arises the Art. septi mohilis nasi.192 Carotis externa. 535. The Arteries of the Face and Pericranium. From the inner side of the external carotid arises: d) The ascending pharyngeal artery, Art. pharyngea ascendens, which ascends at the side of the pharynx, and, dividing into two branches, supplies the posterior wall of the pharynx (see Fig. 542). From the posterior portion of the external carotid arise: e) The occipital artery, Art. occipitalis. At its origin it is covered by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, then passes beneath the M. sterno- deido-mastoideus to the occiput, where it divides into two terminal branches and supplies the soft parts up'to the vertex. It gives off the mastoid artery, Art. mastoidea, which passes through the mastoid foramen to the dura mater, and the Art. cervicalis descendens to the muscles at the back of the neck.193 Carotis externa. 536. Diagram of the Ramification of the Internal Maxillary Artery. f) The posterior auricular artery, Art. auricularis posterior, ascends at the anterior border of the mastoid process, and gives off the stylo-mastoid branch, Art. stylo-mastoidea, through the stylo-mastoid foramen to the Canalis Fattopiac. The anterior branch of the posterior auricular artery supplies the auricle, the posterior the soft parts behind the ear. The terminal branches of the external carotid are: 1. The superficial temporal artery, Arteria temporalis super- ficialis, which is divided upon the temporal fascia into an anterior and a posterior branch. The former supplies the integument of the temporal and frontal regions, the latter passes to the vertex. The super- ficial temporal artery gives off the following branches: the trans- verse facial, Art. transversa faciei, which passes transversely up to the region of the infraorbital foramen; the middle temporal, Art. temporalis media, which, perforating the temporal fascia, supplies the tem- poral muscle; the anterior auricular, Art. auriculares antcriores (2—3 inferior and 1 superior), to the external auditory meatus and to the anterior surface of the pinna; the orbital, or Art. zygomatico-orhi- talis, which passes obliquely forwards to the margin of the orbit. 2. The internal maxillary artery, Art. maxillaris interna, which supplies all the cavities of the head with branches, can be divided into three portions, in the first part of its course it lies behind the con- dyle of the lower jaw, in the second part it runs obliquely forwards and upwards upon the outer surface of the external pterygoid muscle, in the third part it enters the spheno-maxillary fossa.194 Carotis externa. 537. Course and Ramification of the Internal Maxil- lary Artery. View from outside. The branches arising from the first or maxillary portion of the internal maxillary artery are: a) The deep auricular, Art. auricularis profunda, to the external auditory meatus; b) The tympanic, Art. tympanica, through the Glaserian fissure to the tympanum; c) The inferior dental, Art. alveolaris inferior, to the posterior opening of the dental canal. While it runs through this canal it gives off the dental twigs, JRamidi dentales, to the roots of the teeth, escapes by the mental foramen, where it is called mental artery, and anastomoses with the inferior labial, inferior coronary and submental branches. Before it enters the dental canal, it gives off the mylo-hyoid artery, for the mylo-hyoid muscle (see Fig. 538 and 539). d) The middle meningeal, Art. meningea media, which passes directly upwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle and enters the skull by the Foramen spinosum; within the cranium it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, which supply the dura mater and diploe of the vault of the cranium (see Fig. 540). It sends the Art. pe.trosa to the tympanic cavity.195 Carotis externa. 538. Course and Ramification of the Internal Maxillary Artery. View from inside. The branches of tlie second or pterygoid portion of the internal maxillary artery are the following: a) The masseteric, Ramus massetericus, for the M. masscter, which passes through the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw; b) The buccal, Ramus buccinatorius, for the M. buccinator, whose twigs anastomose with those of the infraorbital, transverse facial and facial arteries; c) The pterygoid, Rami pterygoidei, for both MM. pterygoidei; d) The deep temporal, Art. temporales profundae, which are two in number, an anterior and a posterior, for the temporal muscle. The anterior Art. temporalis profunda, sends a branch through the Canalis zygomaticus temporalis into the orbit, where it anastomoses with the lachrymal artery (see Fig. 543). Heitzmann, Atlas.

The branches arising from the third or s p h e n o - rn a x i 11 a r y portion of the internal maxillary artery are: a) The superior alveolar, Art. alveolaris superior. Its branches run through the foramina of the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone to the back teeth of the upper jaw and to the mucous membrane of the antrum of Highmore. b) The infra-orbital, Art. infraorhitalis, runs along the infraorbital canal, supplies the Periorbita, the MM. rectus and obtiquus inferior, the anterior teeth of the upper jaw, passes through the infraorbital foramen to the face, and finally anastomoses with the other arteries of the face. c) The descending palatine, Art. palatina descendens s. pterygo- palatina, sends the Vidian artery, Art. Vidiana, in the Vidian canal to the upper portion of the pharynx, and divides into three branches, which pass through the descending palatine canals to the soft palate and the tonsils. Its largest branch, the anterior palatine, passes along the hard palate to the gums of the incisor teeth and gives off the Art. incisiva to the nasal cavity. d) The spheno-palatine, Art. splieno-palatina, passes through the spheno-palatine foramen into the nasal cavity and supplies the posterior portions of the mucous membrane and the Septum narium, and finally anastomoses with the anterior palatine and the Art. septi mobilis nasi. 26*198 Carotis interna. 542. Course and Ramification of the Internal Carotid and the Vertebral Artery. The internal carotid artery, Carotis interna, which lies at first to the outer side of the external carotid, is separated from the latter by the MM. stylo- glossus and s'tylo-pharyngeus. It is remarkable for the number of curvatures that it presents; in its cervical portion it occasionally presents one or two flexures near the base of the skull, whilst through the rest of its extent it describes a double curvature which resembles the italic s placed horizontally. During its course in the carotid canal and cavernous sinus, it sends small branches to the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity (JRamulus carotico-tympanicus), to the Gasserian ganglion, to the dura mater and to the Tentorium cerebelli.Carotis interna. 199 A., •palpebr, i-rvt. 543. Ramification of the Ophthalmic Artery in the Orbit. Natural size. After the internal carotid has emerged from the cavernous sinus, it gives off: 1. The ophthalmic artery, Art. ophthalmica, which passes through the optic foramen into the orbit and divides below the trochlea into two terminal branches, the nasal, Art. dorsalis nasi, and the frontal, Art. frontalis. Its branches are: a) The small Arteria centralis retinae, which pierces the sheath and substance of the optic nerve, and runs forwards within it to the retina; b) The lachrymal artery, Art. lacrymalis, which passes for- wards along the upper border of the external rectus muscle to the lachry- mal gland and gives off 1 or 2 posterior ciliary arteries, sends malar branches into the Canalis zygomaticus facialis and temporalis, and divides atthe external angle of the eye into the Art. palpebralis externa superior et inferior; c) Muscular branches for the muscles of the eye-ball; d) 2 long and 3 or 4 short posterior ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliarcs jiosticac longae and breves, the former to the iris and ciliary muscle, the latter to the choroid; e) The supraorbital, Art. supraorbital, through the supraorbital foramen to the forehead; f) The anterior and posterior ethmoidal, Art. cthnoidalis anterior etposterior, the former to the cranium where it gives off a meningeal branch, the^ri. meningea anterior, and a nasal branch, which passes through the an- terior foramen in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid to the nasal cavity; the latter through the posterior ethmoidal foramen to the posterior ethmoidal cells.200 Arteria subclavia. 544. Diagram of the Ramification of the Subcla- vian Artery. Further branches of the ophthalmic artery are: g) The palpebral, Art. pal2)ebi'alis interna superior et inferior, which supply the lachrymal sac, caruncle and conjunctiva, and pass into the eyelids; h) The frontal, Art. frontalis, passes around the Margo infraorbitalis to the forehead; i) The nasal, Art. dorsalis nasi, perforates the M. orbicularis and finally unites with the angular artery, the termination of the facial. Other branches of the internal carotid are: 2. The posterior communicating, Art. communicans posterior, which, passing backwards, anastomoses with the posterior cerebral, and helps to form the circle of Willis, Circulus arteriosus Willisii. 3. The choroid, Art. choroidea to the Plexus clioroideus lateralis. 4. The anterior cerebral or Art. corporis callosi, passes for- wards, is connected by means of the anterior communicating artery with the corresponding artery of the other side, and ascends to the Corpus callosum, to supply the hemispheres of the brain. 5. The middle cerebral or Art. fossae Sylvii divides in the fossa of Sylvius into a number of branches for the anterior and inferior cerebral lobes.Arteria subclavia. 201 545. Course and Ramification of the Right Sub- clavian Artery. The subclavian artery, Art. subclavia, arises on the right side from the innominate artery, on the left from the arch of the aorta, passes a short way up into the neck, arches outwards over the pleura and lung, and rests between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles on the first rib. At the outer border of the first rib it assumes the name of axillary artery. Its five branches are the following: 1. The vertebral artery, Art. vertebralis, enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the vertebrae above this. Above the upper border of the axis it inclines outwards and upwards to the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, through which it passes; then it winds backwards and finally enters the skull through the Foramen magnum. At the lower border of the Pons Varolii it unites with the vessel of the opposite side to form the single basilar artery. — Up to its entrance into the cranium it gives off muscular branches, spinal br an c h e s and the posterior meningeal artery. After its entrance it gives off: the anterior and posterior spinal, the two anterior of which unite to form a common trunk; then the posterior inferior cerebellar to the posterior portion of the cerebellum; finally the anterior inferior cerebellar to the anterior portion of the inferior cerebellar region. The basilar artery, Art. basilaris, formed by the junction of the two vertebral arteries, extends from the posterior to the anterior border of the Pons Varolii, where it divides into two branches, the right and left posterior cerebral or Art. profunda cerebri dextra et sinistra.Arteria subclavia. 202 j£A.communicnntcs posteriores 546. Course of the Vertebral Arteries. View from behind, the vertebral canal being laid open. The branches arising from the basilar artery on each side are: the internal auditory, Art. auditiva interna, passing through the internal auditory meatus to the labyrinth, and the superior cerebellar, Art. cerebelli superior, to the upper surface of the cerebellum. The posterior cerebral (Arteriae profundae cerebri), unite with the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid, pass backwards and upwards and supply the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. By the anastomosis which exists between the branches of the internal carotid and ver- tebral arteries at the base of the brain, the circle of Willis, Cir cuius arteriosus Willisii, is formed. The parts of the brain included within this circle are: the Chiasma, Lamina cinerea, Infundibtdum, Tuber cinereum, Corpora albicantia and posterior perforated space. 2. The internal mammary artery, Art. mammaria interna, arises from the subclavian opposite the thyroid axis, and descends behind the clavicle to the inner surface of the anterior wall of the chest. Its branches are: mediastinal, thymic, anterior bronchial, pericardiaco-phrenic to the diaphragm, the anterior intercostal, two for each intercostal space, an upper, larger, and a lower, smaller, perforating branches, Hami per for antes, to the skin and muscles of the thorax, and in the female the external mammary artery to the mamma. Between the sixth costal cartilage and xiphoid appendix, the inter- nal mammary artery divides into the musculo-phrenic and superior epi- gastric, which latter anastomoses with the inferior epigastric and crural arteries (see Fig. 548).203 Arteria subclavia. 547. The Basilary Artery and its Branches at the Base of the Brain. 3. The thyroid axis, Truncus thyreo-cervicalis ; this trunk soon divides into three branches: a) the inferior thyroid, which passes upwards, and after a short course bends inwards and downwards, and is distributed to the under surface of the thyroid gland; its branches are the inferior laryngeal to the larynx, tracheal to the trachea, oesophageal to the oesophagus and ascen- ding cervical; b) the superficial cervical, which, in the supraclavicular fossa passes to the M. trapezius, MM. spleniis and rhomboideis; c) the trans- verse scapular, or suprascapular, which passes behind the clavicle through the scapular notch to the supra- and infraspinous fossae, and supplies the muscles in those regions (see Fig. 550). 4. The superior intercostal, Art. intercostalis supremo, for the first and second intercostal space, which, with the deep cervical for the deep cervical muscles, forms the Truncus costo-cervicalis. 5. The transversalis colli artery, arises between or beyond the scaleni. It pierces the brachial plexus, passes to the upper border of the scapula, where it gives off the Ramus supraspinatus for the MM. trapezius, deltoides, levator scapulae and to the acromion, and then courses along the inner border of the scapula as Art. dorsalis scapulae (see Fig. 550). Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 27Arteria axillaris. 205 549. Course and Ramification of the Right Axillary Artery.

Its branches are: a) The superior thoracic, Art. ihoracica swprema, which passes between the M. pectoralis major and minor to the side of the chest. b) The acromial thoracic, Art. acromialis s. tlioraco-acromialis, passes in front of the acromial process outwards and upwards to the acromion, supplies the capsule of the shoulder joint, and sends acromial branches to the shoulder, which, by anastomosing with the acromial branch of the transverse scapular artery, form the Meteacromiale (see Fig. 550). c) The long thoracic, Art. ihoracica longa, passes downwards upon the M. serratus magnus and supplies it and the outer portion of the mammary gland. 27*550. The Arteries of the Shoulder. Further branches of the axillary artery are: d) The alar thoracic, Art. thoracica alaris, to the glands and areolar tissue of the axilla; not constant. e) The subscapular, Art. subscapular is, which distributes two or three upper, smaller, and one lower, larger branch, to the muscles in its neighbourhood. The lower gives off the Ramus thoracico-dor salts, which runs parallel to the outer border of the scapula and passes to the lower dentations of the M. serratus magnus and to the costal origins of the M. latis- simus dorsi and the Art. circumflexa scapulae, which passes between the M. subscapulars and teres major to the posterior surface of the scapula; it supplies the muscles in the infraspinous fossa. f) The anterior circumflex, Art. circumflexa humeri anterior, passes in front of the surgical neck of the humerus. g) The posterior circumflex, Art. circumflexa humeri posterior, much the larger, passes behind the surgical neck close to the bone. Both supply the soft parts at the shoulder joint and anastomose with each other.Arteria brachialis. 207 The brachial artery. Art. brachialis, extends from the lower border of the teres major muscle to about half an inch below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar. It lies in the Sulcus bicipitalis interims, the median nerve at its outer, the ulnar nerve at its inner side in the upper third of the humerus; further clown the two Venae brachiales are in close con- tact with it. At the bend of the elbow it passes below the Lacertus fibrosus of the tendon of the M. biceps. Besides its muscular branches which are given off from it at different parts of its course, its branches are: a) The profunda or supe- rior profunda, Art. profunda brachii, passes between the internal and long heads of the triceps, in connection with the musculo-spiral (radial) nerve, to the outer side of the upper arm, supplies the M. tri- ceps, then the humerus by means of a nutrient artery, pierces the external intermuscular septum, and descends to the elbow where it is called Art. collatcralis radialis. One terminal branch anastomoses with the recurrent branch of the radial, the other with the Art. anastomotica magna. b) The inferior profunda, also called Art. collatcralis ulnaris superior, arises about the middle of the arm and descends in company with the ulnar nerve; it supplies the M. brachialis anticus and M. triceps and anastomoses with the posterior recur- rent branch of the ulnar. c) The Anastomotica magna or Art. collcderalis ulnaris inferior, passes to- wards the internal condyle, supplies the superficial muscles arising from it, and anastomoses with the anterior recurrent branch of the ulnar, and, after passing behind the humerus, with the superior profunda artery. 551.

At the bend of the elbow the b r a- chial artery lies upon the M. brachialis antieus s. interims, to the inner side of the tendon of the M. biceps, and to the outer side of the M. pronator radii teres. Here it gives off the Art. plicae cubiti superficialis and divides below the bend of the elbow into the radial and ulnar arteries. a) The radial artery, Art. radia- lis, passes along the radial side of the fore- arm to the wrist; in the upper half of the forearm it lies between M. supinator longus and M. pronator radii teres, in the lower half between M. supinator longus and M. flexor carpi radialis. At the wrist it passes between the styloid process of the radius and the scaphoid to the back of the hand, where it is covered by the tendons of the M. extensor ossis mcta- carpii pollicis and M. extensor primi inter- nodii pollicis; it then passes into the palm of the baud between the bases of the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index finger, and arches across the palm to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, where it inosculates with the deep branch of the ulnar artery, forming the deep palmar arch, Arcus volaris pro- fundus. Its branches are: The radial recurrent, which anastomoses with the anterior terminal branch of the superior profunda artery; The muscular branches to the neighbouring muscles; The. superficialis volae, to the muscles of the ball of the thumb; it usually helps to form the superficial palmar arch. At the back of the hand the radial artery gives off (see Fig. 559): The posterior or dorso-carpal branch, Ramus carpi dorsalis, which, with the branches of the external interosseous artery helps to form the Bete carpi dorsale (posterior carpal arch); The first dorsal interosseous artery, Art. intcrossea dor salis prima, which supplies both sides of the thumb and the radial side of the index finger. Having returned to the palm of the hand, the radial artery gives off the Art. digitalis volaris communis, from which the Art. volaris indicis radialis arises, and which finally divides into two Arteriae volares pollicis.

It crosses the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone and passes into the palm of the hand where it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial branch forms, usually with the superficialis volae of the radial artery, the superficial palmar arch, Arcus volaris sublimis, the deep branch forms with the ter- mination of the radial artery the deep palmar arch, Arcus volaris profundus. The branches of the ulnar artery are: 1. The anterior ulnar recurrent, which passes back to the internal condyle of the humerus and anastomoses with Art. anastomotica magna ; 2. The posterior ulnar recurrent, the larger, which anasto- moses behind the internal condyle of the humerus with the inferior profunda artery; 3. Several muscular branches for the neighbouring muscles, one of which supplies the ulna by means of a nutrient artery. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 28Arteria radkdis et ulnavis. 212 558.

The posterior interosseous artery passes through the interosseous membrane, sends the interosseous recurrent branch to the posterior region of the elbow, lies upon the MM. extensor ossis metacarpi, and extensor secundi internodii p>ollicis, gives off a number of muscular branches and finally anastomoses with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery so as to form the posterior carpal arch, Mete carpi dorsale. The anterior interosseous artery passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane to the M. pronator qua- dratics, behind which it passes, gives off a branch to the Rcte carpi volarc, and, piercing the interosseous membrane as Art. p>erforans inferior, descends to the back of the wrist, where it joins the posterior carpal arch. 5. The last branch of the ulnar artery before it divides, is the posterior carpal, for the posterior carpal arch.213 Arteria radialis et ulnaris. 559. The Arteries at the Back of the Hand. The superficial palmar arch, Arcus volaris sublimis (see Fig. 557) has its convexity directed towards the fingers ; it is the continuation of the ulnar artery, and is sometimes completed by inosculating with the superficialis volae branch of the radial. From its convexity three digi- tal branches, Arteriae digitales volares communes, are given off, each of which divides into two, the Arteriae digitales volares propriae, to supply the contiguous surfaces of the second, third, fourth and fifth fingers, down to the tip; a fourth branch supplies the ulnar side of the little finger. The deep palmar arch, Arcus volaris profundus (see Fig. 558), the smaller and less convex, is formed principally by the radial artery. It gives off three palmar interosseous branches, Arteriae inter- osseac volares, which lie in front of the interosseous spaces of the four fingers, send off perforating branches, Rami interossei perforantes, to the dorsum of the hand and inosculate with the digital branches from the superficial arch. From the posterior carpal arch, Bete carpi dorsah, only three interosseous arteries, Arteriae interosseae dorsales, are given off, the first arising directly from the radial artery; this latter divides into three branches, the others only into two; these are called d 0 r- sal digital arteries, Arteriae digitales dorsales, and pass down as far as the second phalanges. 28*214 Aorta thoracica. 560. Segment of the Thoracic Aorta with Injected Vasavasorum. View from behind. Natural size. The descending thoracic aorta, Aorta thoracica descendens, gives off numerous, but mostly small branches. These are: a) The posterior bronchial, Arteriae bronchioles posteriores, to the posterior wall of the bronchial tubes, the right frequently arises from the third or fourth right intercostal artery. The anterior bronchial, Arteriae bron- chioles anteriores, arise from the internal mam- mary artery. b) The oesophageal, Arteriae oeso- phageae, 2 — 4 in number. c) The mediastinal, Arteriae media- stinicae, to the structures in the posterior media- stinum. These, as well as the previous, supply also the posterior wall of the pericardium by means of the posterior pericardiac arteries. d) The intercostal, Arteriae intercostales, for the nine inferior intercostal spaces and for the lower border of the twelfth rib, the two upper intercostal spaces being supplied by the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery. The left are shorter than the right. Each of these arteries divides into a posterior or dorsal and an anterior or intercostal branch. The dorsal branches pass each between the transverse processes of two vertebrae to the muscles of the back, and also supply the spinal cord and its membranes with branches, which enter through the intervertebral foramina. Each intercostal branch passes forwards to the sternum in the Sulcus costae of the rib above it, sends the supracostal branch to the upper border of the rib below and finally unites with the anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary artery. The intercostal branches supply the intercostal muscles, the M. pectoralis major, M. ser- ratus macjnus and the costal origins of the abdominal muscles, in the female also the mammary gland.Aorta thoracica. 215 561. Course and Ramification of the Descending Thoracic Aorta. The origins from the posterior part of the aorta of each two of the intercostal arteries, are nearer to each other, the lower these arteries are placed. Several intercostal arteries may arise from a common trunk, which descends in front of the heads of the ribs. The artery which runs at the lower border of the twelfth rib, should, according to Haller, be more correctly called the first lumbar, Art. lumbalis prima. The upper intercostal arteries frequently arise lower than the position of the intercostal spaces to which they belong.216 Aorta abdominalis. 562. Course and Ramification of the Abdominal Aorta. The abdominal aorta, Aorta abdominalis, gives off a large number of branches. From its anterior aspect three single arteries arise, the others arise from its lateral aspect. The single arteries are: 1. The coeliac artery or axis, Art. codiaca; it is a short thick trunk, which arises from the aorta opposite the margin of the diaphragm; it passes above the upper border of the pancreas, a little to the left, and immediately gives off two phrenic arteries. These ramify in the suprarenal capsules, and in the lumbar and costal portions of the diaphragm, and anastomose with each other, as well as with the intercostal arteries (from the thoracic aorta) and the musculo-phrenic (from the internal mammary).Aorta abdominalls. 217 563. The Branches of the Coeliac Axis. View after removal of the Lesser Omentum. To the right of the cardia, the coeliac axis divides into three branches: a) The gastric, Art. coronaria ventriculi superior sinistra, which runs in the lesser curvature of the stomach from left to right; its branches anastomose at the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach with the Art. coronaria superior dextra, the Art. coronariae inferiores and the Vasa brevia. b) The hepatic, Art. hepatica, which runs in the Lig. hepato- duodenal?, sends off the Art. coronaria superior dextra to the lesser curvature of the stomach (a branch of this is the pyloric artery) and then divides into an ascending and a descending branch. — The ascen- ding branch is the Art. hepatica propria, which, dividing into two bran- ches, enters the porta of the liver; its right branch gives off the cystic artery, supplying the gall-bladder, and passes into the right lobe of the liver; the left branch passes to the left lobe.Aorta abdominalis. 218 504. The Branches of the Coeliac Artery. The stomach being turned upwards. The descending ramus of the hepatic artery is called the gastro-duodenal artery; behind the pylorus this artery divides again into two branches: Art. panereatico-duodenalis for the head of the pancreas and the duo- denum ; Art. gastro-epiploica dextra (Art. coronaria ventriculi inferior dextra) run- ning from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach. Its branches pass to the stomach and great omentum, and it anastomoses with the Art. gastro-epiploica sinistra. c) The splenic, Art. splenica, passes to the left to the spleen and gives off: The Art. gastro-epiploica sinistra (coronaria ventriculi inferior sinistra) and 4—6 Vasa brevia to the fundus of the stomach. By the anastomosis of these branches two arches are formed: the Arcus arteriosus ventriculi superior, at the lesser curvature of the stomach, and the Arcus arteriosus ventriculi inferior at the great curvature.Aorta abdominalis. 219 rnl/ileum. 565. The Ramification of the Superior Mesenteric Artery. 2. The superior mesenteric artery, Art. mesenterica (mesaraica) superior, arises immediately below the coeliac axis, passes behind the head of the pancreas to the root of the mesentery and supplies the greatest part of the intestines by means of about twenty branches. It forms: a) The inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery, Art. cluo- deinalis inferior, for the descending portion of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas; b) The intestinal branches, Arteriae jejunales et ileae, for the small intestine; c) The i 1 e o - c o 1 i c for the termination of the small and com- mencement of the large intestine; d) The Art. colica dextra for the ascending colon; e) The Art. colica media for the transverse colon. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 29Aorta ahdominaJis. 220 560. The Vasa intestini tenuis. The 16—18 intestinal arteries, Vasa intestini tenuis, pass between the two layers of the mesentery to the jejunum and ilium. Each vessel divides into two branches, which unite with a similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches. From these arches smaller bran- ches arise, which again unite with similar branches from either side, and thus a second series of arches is formed; from these latter, a third and even fourth or fifth series of arches are constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intestine. From the terminal arches, numerous small vessels, the Hamuli intestinales arise, which encircle the intestine, upon which they are distri- buted, ramifying thickly between its coats. The Art. ileo-colica, colica dextra and colica media also form a number of arches with each other, espe- cially at the angles between the ascending and transverse colon, and two or three between the transverse and descending colon. 3. The inferior mesenteric artery, Art. mesenterica inferior, divides soon after its origin into two branches: the Colica sinistra to the descending colon, and the superior haemorrhoidal artery to the sigmoid flexure and rectum. These branches too, anastomose with each other, forming arterial arches.221 Aorta abdominalis. 567. The Ramification of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. The other branches of the abdominal aorta, one on each side, are: 1. The suprarenal arteries, Arteriae suprarenales, 2. The renal arteries, Arteriae renales, which arise below the superior mesenteric artery, give oft' capsular branches to the connective tissue and fat around the kidney, also -smaller branches to the pelvis of the kidney and the ureter, and then enter the substance of the kidney. 3. The internal spermatic arteries, Arteriae spermaticae internae; the one on the left side arises from the aorta below the renal artery, while the right usually arises from the right reual artery. In the male they are directed outwards, to the internal abdominal ring, and accompany the other consti- tuents of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal to the testis; in the female they pass to the ovaries and along the Fallopian tubes to the uterus, and anastomose with a branch of the uterine arteries (see Fig. 575). 29*222Aorta ahdominalis. 223 569. Course and Ramification of the Abdominal Aorta. Specimen from a child. Natural size. 4. The lumbar arteries, Arteriae lumbales, are five in number on each side and arise from the back part of the aorta; they pass out- wards behind the psoas muscle. Each artery divides into a posterior or dorsal branch, which, with its spinal branch is distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes, and an anterior branch for the broad abdominal muscles. If the artery which runs along the lower border of the twelfth rib is counted as an intercostal artery, there are only four lumbar arteries. In front of the fourth lumbar vertebra the abdominal aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries, Arteriae iliacae communes. These pass downwards towards the sacro-iliac symphisis and divide opposite the promontory into the external iliac or crural and the inter- nal iliac or hypogastric arteries. Between both common iliac arteries the Art. sacralis media, which passes down to the coccyx, arises; it gives off lateral branches, and partly supplies the M. psoas magnus, the M. iliacus interims and the rectum.224 Artefia ilidca interna. 570. Course and Ramification of the Arteries of the Pelvis. The internal iliac artery, Art. iliaca interna s. hypogastrica, extends from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery downwards towards the great sacro-sciatic foramen, where it divides into two large trunks, an anterior and a posterior, which supply the pelvic viscera, gluteal region and the external genital organs. The posterior branches of the internal iliac artery are: a) The ileo-lumbar, Art. ileo-lumbalis, which ascends beneath the psoas muscle, and gives off the iliac branch for the M. iliacus, and the lumbar branch for the MM', psoas and quad/ratus lumborum. b) The lateral sacral, Arteriae sacrales laterales, a superior larger and an inferior smaller for the MM. pyriformis, levator aid and coccygexis. Some of its branches pass through the anterior sacral foramina to the termination of the spinal cord, others through the posterior sacral foramina to the long muscles of the back.225 Avteria iliaca interna. 571. Course and Ramification of the Arteries of the Pelvis. View from behind, after removal of the posterior pelvic wall. c) The superior gluteal artery, Art. glutaea superior, the largest branch of the internal iliac artery, passes above the upper border of the pyriformis muscle through the great sacro-sciatic notch, to the gluteal muscles; one of its branches passes forwards between M. glutaeus maximus and medius, the other, larger, passes between M. glu- taeus medius and minimus. Both divide into a number of branches. The anterior branches of the internal iliac artery are: a) The obturator, Art. obturatoria; it passes through the obtu- rator canal in company with the obturator nerve and divides at the upper border of the M. obturatorius into an anterior or internal and a posterior or external branch. The internal ramifies in the MM. adductor femoris longus et brevis, pectineus and gracilis; the exter- nal sends the Art. acetabxdi to the IAg. teres of the hip-joint and finally distributes branches to the external rotator muscles.Arteria iliaca interna. 226 1. ileo-lum bet I.

Specimen from a child. Within the pelvis the obturator artery supplies the MM. iliacus, obturator interims and levator ani and sends the Ramus anastomoticus to the Symphisis pubis (see Fig. 570). The two most important anomalies in the origin and communi- cation of the obturator and inferior epigastric arteries are shown in Fig. 573 and 574. b) The sciatic artery, Art. ischiadica s. glutaea inferior, leaves the pelvis below the M. piriformis in company with the sciatic nerve; it supplies the external rotators of the thigh and the flexors of the leg which arise from the Tuber ischii. A small branch, the Art. comes N. ischiadici, accompanies the sciatic nerve. c) The vesical arteries, Arteriae vesicates, a superior and an i n f e r i o r, very often also a middle. The superior supplies the posterior wall and fundus of the bladder; the inferior the base of the bladder, the Vesiculae seminales, the prostate gland and, in the female, the vagina (see Fig. 575). In the male it also sends off the artery of the Fas deferens, which passes down as far as the epididymis.Arteria iliaca interna. 227 573.

After a specimen of Hyrtl. 2/3 natural size. cl) The uterine artery, Art. uterina, passes downwards to the neck of the uterus, ascends in a tortuous course on the side of the organ to its fundus, supplies branches to the vagina and Portio vaginalis uteri and finally anastomoses with the ovarian (spermatic) artery. One branch, which runs in the round ligament, reaches the inguinal canal and communicates with the inferior epigastric artery. e) The internal or common p u d i c a r t e r y, Art. pudenda communis, leaves the pelvis by the great sacro-sciatic foramen and reenters it by the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. It passes downwards on the inner surface of the ischium, curves forwards and upwards towards the pubic arch and divides here into the artery of the Corpus cavernosum and the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris. The branches of the internal p u d i c are: 1. The middle h a e m o r r h o i d a 1, while still within the pelvis; 2. The inferior haemorrhoidal, two or three in number, pass through the ischio-rectal space to the M. levator ani and the anus; 3. The perineal or superficial perineal, which passes for- wards through the M. transversus perinei and gives off the posterior scrotal arteries in the male, the posterior 1 a b i a 1 in the female.Arteria iliaca interna. 229 576. The Ramification of the Internal Pudic Artery. 4. The transverse perineal, for the region between anus and Bulbus urethrae, is either a branch of the superficial perineal or the internal pudic; 5. The artery of the bulb of the urethra for the Bulbus urethrae and Cowper's glands; 6. The artery of the Corpus cavernosum, (Art. profunda penis) passes to the anterior extremity of the Corpus cavernosum. 7. The dorsal artery of the penis (or clitoris) ascends between the crus and pubic symphisis, runs forwards on the dorsum of the penis to the glans, and accompanies with the corresponding artery of the opposite side the dorsal vein of the penis. In the foetus the internal iliac artery is called the hypogastric; from it arises the umbilical artery, which, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side, passes to the umbilicus and from there to the umbilical cord, and ramifies in the placenta. After birth the umbilical arteries become imper- vious and form the Ligamenta vesico-umbilicalia lateralia. The obliteration continues up to the origin of the superior vesical artery. 30*230 Arteria cruralis. ilei A. circumfl. A. ejpigastr. '"J- A.A ext. 577. C ourse and Ramification of the Crural Artery. The crural artery, Art. cruralis, has received the names of external iliac, femoral and popliteal in different parts of its course. The external iliac ar- tery passes obliquely down- wards and outwards along the inner border of the M. j)soas, from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery to Poupart's ligament, where it enters the thigh, and be- comes the femoral artery. The femoral artery com- mences immediately behind Poupart's ligament, and pas- sing down the fore part and inner side of the thigh, ter- minates at the opening in the M. adductor magnus at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh, where it becomes the p o p- 1 i t e a 1. The popliteal a r t e r y, commencing at the opening in the M. adduc- tor- magnus, passes obliquely downwards and outwards behind the knee-joint to the lower border of the M. pop- Kteus, and there divides into the anterior and poste- rior tibial arteries. The branches of the external iliac are: a) The inferior epi- gastric, Art. epigastriea inferior. It at first descends to reach Poupart's ligament, and then ascends obliquely inwards to the outer mar- gin of the M. rectus abdo- minis, and anastomoses above the umbilicus with the supe- rior epigastric artery from the internal mammary (see Fig. 548 and 570). From it arise the p u b i c, Bamus ana- stomoticus pubicus; the ex- ternal spermatic to the spermatic cord and sheaths of the scrotum; and numerous m u s c u 1 a r b ranches.231 Arteria cruralis. b) The circumflex iliac artery, Art. cir- cumflexa ilei (see Fig. 569) runs obliquely upwards and outwards along the crest of the ilium. It supplies the muscles which arise from the crest of the ilium. The femoral ar- tery gives off the fol- lowing branches: 1. Inguinal, Hamuli inguinales. 2. Superficial epi- gastric, Art. epigastrica superficialis, frequently also a superficial circum- flex iliac, Art. circum- flexa ilei superficialis, both for the integument. 3. External pudic, Arteriae pudendae externae, a superficial and a deep, pass transversely inwards; the deep gives off the anterior scro- tal or labial arteries. 4. Deep femoral, Arteria profunda femoris, nearly equal in size to the superficial femoral, sup- plies all the nruscles of the thigh. It arises 1—14/2 in- ches below Poup art's ligament, passes inwards and backwards between the MM. adductor longus and brevis, and finally perforates the M. adductor magnus. It gives off t w o circumflex arteries: the internal, Art. cir- cumfte.va femoris interna, and the external, Art. circumflexa femoris externa. The internal winds back- wards around the lesser trochanter and after ha- ving supplied the muscles at the inner side of the thigh, divides into an ascending and a des- cending branch. Branches oi A. ileo-lumbal.^ 578. The Arteries at the Outer Side of the Hip and Posterior Side of the Thigh.232 Topography. The external cir- cumflex artery passes outwards, behind the AT. rec- tus femoris, supplies the muscles in front and on the outer side of the thigh, sends the Ramus musculo- articularis down to the knee and finally perforates the M. vastus externus. The p e r- f orating arteries of the profunda femoris, Arteriae perforantes (see Fig. 578), pass through the tendons of the adductors to the posterior side of the thigh; they are three in number, the termination of the pro- funda femoris being the fourth. 5. Muscular bran- ches, Rami muscidares, for the muscles of the thigh. 6. Art. superficialis genu (anastomotica magna) passes to the internal condyle of the femur and anastomoses with the superior internal articular branch of the popli- teal artery. The popliteal artery gives off muscular and articular branches. The latter, which form the Rete articulare genu, are the following: The superior articular, Arteriae articulares genu supe.riores, a larger external and a smaller internal; The inferior articular, Arteriae articulares genu inferiores, also an external and an internal; The middle or a z y g o s articular, Art. articulationis genu media, for the internal ligaments of the knee-joint. The two superior and two inferior lie close to the bone, the middle pierces the popliteal ligament and the posterior capsular wall, and passes into the cavity of the knee-joint.Arteria tibialis antica. 233 580. Course of the Ante- rior Tibial Artery. The popliteal artery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries: 1. The anterior tibial, Art. tibialis antica, passes through the upper interosseous space to the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane and lies at first between the M. tibialis anticus and M. exten- sor longus digitorum, further down be- tween M. tibialis anticus and M. exten- sor pollicis longus. At the ankle-joint it lies upon the capsule and, under the name of dorsal artery of the f o o t, Art. dorsalis pedis, passes to the dorsum of the foot. Its bran- ches are: a) The recurrent tibial, Arteriae recurrentes tibiales, to the Rete articulare genu; b) Muscular branches, Rami musculares, 10—20 in number, for the muscles at the front of the leg; c) Two anterior malleo- 1 a r, Arteriae malleolares anteriores, an external and an internal, which help to form the Rete mattcolare. From the Art. dorsalis pedis arise (see Fig. 581): a) The tarsal, Art. tarsea, to the outer border of the foot, where it anastomoses with the external anterior malleolar and the metatarsal arteries; b) The metatarsal, Art. meta- tarsca, arises further down either alone or together with the tarsal artery, and forms with it, at the outer border of the foot, an arch, the Arcus pedis dor- salis. It gives off three dorsal inter- osseous arteries, which divide into dorsal digital branches, Arteriae digitales pedis dorsales, and an exter- nal digital, Art. digitalis dorsalis externa, for the little toe.234 Arteria tibialis antica and postica.

The * dorscdis pedis then passes between the bases of I. and II. metatarsal bones into the Planta p& and there forms, with the external plantar arte the plantar arch, Arcus plantar is. 2. The posterior tibial artery, J tibialis postica, descends upon the M. tibialis posti i and M. flexor digitorum longus to the ankle-joi, behind the internal malleolus; it then passes i* the Planta pedis and divides into the external f 1 internal plantar arteries.235 Arteria tibialis antica and postica. 583.

It passes along the posterior side of the fibula between M. flexor longns pollicis and M. tibialis posticus, supplies the deep muscles in this region, and divides above the outer malleolus into the anterior and posterior peroneal. Other branches of the posterior tibial artery are: the nutrient artery, Art. nutritia tibiae; 10 —15 muscular branches; one com- municating branch to the peroneal; the posterior malleolar branches, an external and an internal; finally internal cal- canean branches.

The terminal branches of the posterial tibial artery are the inter- nal and external plantar, Art. plantar is interna and Art. plantaris externa. The internal, smaller, lies between the M. abductor pollic is and M. flexor brevis digitorum, and sends off superficial and deep branches for the skin and muscles at the inner border of the sole of the foot. The external plantar artery passes outwards above the M. flexor brevis digitorum, and gives off branches for the integument and muscles, and the external digital, Art. digitalis plantaris externa, for the outer side of the little toe. Running inwards from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone to the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones, it joins the dorsal artery of the foot, thereby forming the plantar arch, Arcus plantaris. From the arch arise four interosseous arteries, Arteriae interosseae plantares, which send perforating branches to the dorsum of the foot, and then divide each into two plantar digital branches, for the contiguous borders of the toes. The first plantar interosseous artery however, gives off three branches, supplying also the inner side of the great toe with an internal plantar artery.237 Veins.Vein; 238 587. The Sinuses of the Dura Mater. Lateral view. The venous blood is returned to the right auricle by two prin- cipal trunks, the superior or descending and the inferior or ascending Venae cavae. The superior Vena cava descends to the right auricle of the heart at the right side of the ascending arch of the aorta and in front of the right pulmonary vessels. It is formed by the union of the right and left innominate veins s. Venae anonymae and receives the V. azygos. Each V. innominata is formed by the union of the subclavian, internal (common) jugular and external jugular veins ; each is joined by the following veins: the vertebral, internal mammary, superior inter- costal, thymic, pericardiac, superior phrenic and anterior mediastinal; the left also by the V. thyreoidca ima. The common jugular, V. jugularis communis, passes up as far as the superior triangle of the neck on the outer side of the common carotid, where it is formed by the union of the internal jugular and common facial veins.239 Veins. 588. The Sinuses of the Dura Mater. Seen from above. The internal jugular vein passes out by the jugular foramen, where it forms a dilatation, the sinus or Bulbus superior; it receives the pharyngeal veins, often a lingual vein. In the jugular foramen it is connected with the transverse sinus. Of the sinuses of the dura mate r some are double, one on each side, some single. 1. The largest single sinus is called the Confluens sinuum s. Torcular HeropMli; it lies in front of the internal occipital protuberance and is the point of meeting of all the sinuses. 2. The transverse sinus is double. 3. The superior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falciformismajor, occupies the attached margin of the Falx cerebri. 4. The inferior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falci- formis minor, is contained in the posterior part of the free margin of the Falx cerebri. 5. The straight sinus (rectus) passes obliquely backwards. 6. The two cavernous sinuses at the sides of the Sella turcica,- their continuations are the Sinus alae parvae, both of which are connected by means of the circular sinus, Sinus circularis Bidlei. 7.

The meningeal veins open in the neighbouring sinuses. The veins of the Diploe empty partly into the sinuses of the dura mater, partly into the veins of the pericranium. The internal auditory veins are very small. The ophthalmic vein commences at the inner angle of the eye, passes backwards at the inner wall of the orbit to the sphenoidal fissure, and empties into the cavernous sinus.

Sesemann. i/2 natural size. b) The anterior jugular vein commences near the hyoid bone from the convergence of several superficial branches from the submaxillary region; it passes down between the median line and the anterior border of the M. sterno-cleido-mastoideus, is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by means of the Arcus venosus juguli and passes horizontally outwards, to open into the common jugular. c) The V. mcdiana colli passes down in the median line, and opens into the Arcus venosus juguli, or into the anterior or common jugular veins. It is often entirely absent.Veins. 243 592. The Veins of the Face and Neck. The deep veins of the neck besides the pharyngeal, lin- gual and superior thyroid are the following: a) The vertebral runs in the canal of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and receives the veins from the spinal canal and the cer- vical veins; finally it terminates in the innominate or subclavian veins. b) The inferior thyroid receives veins from the pharynx and larynx and unites with the corresponding vein of the opposite side, thereby forming the Plexus thyreoideus imus, and then the V. thyrcoidea impar, which opens into the left innominate vein.

Vertical Section of Two Dorsal Vertebrae, showing the Spinal Veins. After Breschet (Gray).The subclavian vein, V. sub- clavia, receives the veins of the arm and shoulder. These are: 1. Deep brachial veins, Venae profundae braclui, for the bra- chial artery and its branches, which they accompany on both sides. They arise as palmar digital veins, form the superficial and deep venous arches, then radial and ulnar veins, finally two brachial veins which unite to form the single axillary vein, whose direct con- tinuation is the subclavian vein. 2. Superficial brachial veins, Venae snhcutaneae braclui, between skin and fascia, which, freely anastomosing with each other, arise from an arch, the Bete venosum manus dorsale. a) The cephalic vein com- mences at the dorsum of the thumb, passes along the inner side of the forearm, above the elbow in the Sul- cus bicipitalis externus, then between M. pectoralis major and M. deltoides, and terminates between these muscles in the axillary vein just below the clavicle. b) The basilic vein passes along the ulnar side of the forearm, at first usually double, then becoming single, ascends in the Sulcus bicipitalis internus, pierces the fascia in the middle of the upper arm and opens into the internal brachial vein. c) The median vein is either single or double, and divides into the median cephalic and the median basilic; the latter is usually the larger. An anastomosing branch for the deep radial or brachial veins is always present. 245 595. The Superficial Veins of the Upper Extremity. 32*Veins. 246 596. The Vena azygos and Vena hemiazygos. (Semi-diagrammatic.) The veins of the wall of the thorax unite to form the V. azygos. The right azy- gos vein commences oppo- site the I. or II. lumbar vertebra from the Plexus venosus lumbalis, enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the diaphragm and passes along the right side of the vertebral column to the III. dorsal vertebra, where it arches forwards over the root of the right lung and terminates in the superior V. cava. It receives 9 or 10 lower intercostal veins, several oesopha- geal, mediastinal and vertebral veins. The left, small azygos vein or F. hemiazygos ascends only as far as the VII. or VIII. dorsal vertebra, and then passes back to the right azygos vein behind the aorta. The upper left inter- costal veins usually unite to form theV. hemiazygos superior, which opens into theF. hemi- azygos, but is also connected with the left innominate vein. The V. azygos and hemiazygos vary a great deal as regards their origin and course.Veins. 597. The Venous Plexus of the Spermatic Cord, Plexus pampini- formis. The inferior Vena cava is formed by the junction of the right and left common iliac veins. It perforates the central tendon of the diaphragm, enters the pericardium, and ter- minates in the lower and back part of the right auricle of the heart. — Each common iliac vein is formed by the union of the external (V. cruralis) and internal (V. liypogastrica) iliac veins. The left common iliac vein is longer than the right, and receives the two Venae sacrales mediae. The V. cava inferior receives: a) The lumbar veins, which freely anastomose with each other and form the Plexus venosus lumbalis; b) The internal spermatic veins arise from the pampiniform plexus of the sper- matic cord, and ascend, the one on the right side directly to the V. cava inferior, the one on the left side to the renal vein; c) The renal veins, the left longer than the right; d) The suprarenal veins, the left of which usually opens into the left renal vein ; e) The hepatic veins, two or three larger and several smaller; f) The phrenic veins. In the foetus the umbilical vein also opens into the inferior Vena cava, whereby this vein receives arterial blood (see Fig. 607).248 Veins. 598. The Veins of the Male Pelvis. The common iliac vein is formed by the union of the i n t e r- nal iliac vein, V. hypogastric®, and the external iliac, s. V. cruralis. The internal iliac vein is formed by the double superior and inferior gluteal veins, the i 1 e o -1 u m b a r , obturator, lateral sacral, the veins of the bladder, of the rectum and of the genital organs. The latter form the following plexuses: The haemorrhoidal plexus communicating with the portal system; The vesical plexus, communicating with the haemorrhoidal and pudendal plexuses; The pudendal plexus, surrounding the prostate in the male, formed by the prostatic veins, those of the Vesiculae seminalcs, the Venae profundae penis and the V. dorsalis penis.Veins. 249 599. The Injected Arteries and Veins of a Preg- *| nant Uterus. View from before. 2/3 natural size. After Hyrtl. In the female the pudendal plexus is called utero-vagi.nal plexus. It surrounds the vagina and both sides of the uterus up to its fundus; it anastomoses with the other plexuses of the pelvis and opens by means of the short uterine veins into the internal iliac. In the preg- nant state of the uterus, its venous plexus is especially well developed.Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 33 w41IBBi N.TIBIALIS Veins. 251 C02. The Superficial Veins of the Lower Extremity. The veins of the lower extremity are superficial and deep. The deep accompany the arteries; those above the knee are usually single, those below, double. The external iliac or crural vein lies along the inner side of the external iliac artery; the femoral vein accompanies the femoral artery through the upper two thirds of the thigh; in the lower part of its course it lies external to the artery, higher up, it is behind it. The popliteal vein is formed by the junction of the venae comities of the anterior and posterior tibial vessels; in the lower part of its course it lies internal to the artery, but above the knee-joint is close to its outer side. The superficial veins arc formed from an arch, the Rete venosum pedis dorsale, and are the following: a) The internal or long saphenous vein, principally from the inner portion of the Retc dorsale, ascends in front of the internal malleolus to the leg and behind the internal condyle of the femur to the thigh. It passes through the .saphenous opening in the Fascia lata (Fovea oralis) and terminates in the femoral vein. In it the superficial veins of the inner and partly of the posterior sides of the lower extremity empty, also the exter- nal pudic, superficial epigastric and inguinal veins. Sometimes it is double throughout its entire course. b) The external (posterior) or short saphenous vein ascends from the outer border of the foot behind the external malleolus close to the Tench Achilles, then between both heads of the M. gastro- cnemius to the popliteal space, where it pierces the popliteal fascia and opens into the popliteal vein.Portal Vein. 253 605. The Brandies of Origin of the Vena portae. The portal vein, Vena portae, receives its branches or roots of origin from the digestive organs and carries their blood to the liver. These roots unite to form the Truncus venae portae, which ramifies in the liver. The branches of origin of the V. portae are: a) The superior gastric vein, which runs along the upper curvature of the stomach from left to right, and receives the blood from the upper portion of the stomach and superior transverse portion of the duodenum. b) The s u p e r i o r or g r e a t mesenteric vein, which receives the blood from those portions of the intestine, which are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and the pancreatico-duodenal branch of the hepatic artery. 33*254 Portal Vein. 606. The Ramifications in the Liver of the Portal Vein of a Child. After a specimen of Hyrtl. 4/, natural size. c) The inferior mesenteric vein, whose branches correspond to those of the inferior mesenteric artery, and which usually empties into the splenic vein (s. Fig. 605). d) The splenic vein, which runs along the upper border of the pancreas, and opens into the portal vein. The branches of origin of the portal vein unite behind the head of the pancreas to form the Truncus venae, portae, which receives the V. gastro-epiploica and the V. cystidis felleae. The ramifications of the portal vein in the liver arise from two branches and, in the lobes of the liver, pass on into the capillaries. The circulation of the foetal system is shown in Fig. 607- In it, the arterial blood (V. umbilicalis) is marked by transverse lines, the venous blood — system of the two Venae cavae — by longitudinal lines, the mixed blood, which circulates everywhere in the foetus, by lines crossing each other. The direction of the current of the blood is shown by the arrows.Portal Vein, 255 007. Diagram of the Foetal Circulation.256 Portal Vein. 608. Placenta.

It commences at the anterior surface of the II. or III. lumbar vertebra to the right and behind the aorta, by three roots, Radices ductus thoracici, the right and left of which are called Trunci lym/phatici lumbales, while the middle is called the Truncus lymphaticus mtestinalzs. The former commence from the lumbar plexuses, which collect the lymphatics of the pelvis and lower extremities; the latter forms the union of the lacteals of the alimentary canal. The place of union of these three roots is called Cisterna s. Receptaculum chyli. The thoracic duct ascends into the thorax with the aorta, and there lies between the aorta and V. azygos. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra it pas- ses to the left and behind the oesophagus, and at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra it turns outwards, at the same time arching downwards and forwards, to terminate at the angle of junction of the left common jugular and left subclavian veins. It receives the lym- phatics from the left and lower part of the right half of the thorax, also those from the left side of the head and neck and the left upper extremity, by means of the Truncus jugular is sinister and Truncus subclavius sinister. The lymphatics of the upper part of the right half of the thorax, as well as those from the right side of the head and neck and the right upper extremity, form the right lymphatic or thoracic duct, Ductus ihoracicus dexter, Avhieh opens into the right V. innominata.259 Lymphatics. 612..

The Superficial Lymphatics and Glands of the Head and Neck. The lymphatics of the head and neck converge to the superficial and deep lymphatic glands, finally to the Plexus jugularis situated around the common jugular vein, whose Vas efferens ojtens into the thoracic duct of the corresponding side, as Truncus jugularis. The glands are the following: a) Anterior and posterior auricular glands; the ante- rior in the parotid gland, the posterior behind the ear. b) Deep facial glands, in the spheno-maxillary fossa and at the side of the pharynx.Lymphatics. 261 014. The Deep Lymphatics and Glands of the Neck and Axilla. c) Submaxillary glands at the lower border of the lower jaw ; d) Superficial cervical glands at the upper lateral portion of the neck in front of and upon the M. stemo-clcido-mastoideus. The lymphatics leaving these glands converge to the: e) Superior jugular glands in the superior triangle of the nock, and to the f) Supraclavicular or inferior jugular glands in the clavicular fossa, which, 15—20 in number, communicate with each other and form the Plexus lyrnphaticus jugularis, which passes up as far as the jugular foramen. 34*262 615. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity. The lymphatics of the uppei\ex- tremity, the thorax and shoulder, col- lect in the Plexus lymphaticus axillaris, with 8—12 axillary glands. This plexus forms the Truncus lymphaticus subclavius,which opens into the thora- cic duct of the corresponding side. The lymphatics of the upper extremity are partly superficial and partly deep. a) The superficial lym- ph a t i c s commence at the fingers; those from the palmar side ascend on the inner side of the forearm, those from the dorsal side at first on the outer side, then across the border of the ulna to the inner sur- face of the forearm. In the bend of the elbow are one or two Glan- dulae cubitales. The lymphatics pass some directly into the axilla, others with the cephalic vein to the space between M. ddtoides and M. pectoralis major. b) The deep lymphatics accompany the veins of the arm, but are less numerous than the superficial; they form a few cubital glands, Glandulae cubitales, and deep bra- chial glands, Glandulae brachiales profundae.263 Lymphatics. 616. The Deep Lymphatics of the Axilla. After a specimen of Patruban. The lymphatics of the wall of the thorax are also both superficial and deep. a) The superficial pass to the space between M. deltoides and M. pectoralis major and at the lower border of the M. pectoralis major to the axilla. b) The deep accompany the bloodvessels of the thorax, receive the lymphatics of the mamma and are connected by branches with the internal lymphatics of the thorax. The lymphatics of the shoulder pass out from the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions, and ascend at the border of the M. latissimus clorsi, partly with the branches of the axillary artery.264 Lymphatics. 617. The Lymphatics of the Thorax. The lymphatics of the thoracic cavity are the folio wing: a) The intercostal lymphatics, which accompany the Vasa intercostalia. They pass out. from the lateral wall of the thorax and abdomen, from the diaphragm, the pleura, the muscles of the back and the vertebral column and pass through 16—20 intercostal glands. b) The mediastinal lymphatics emerge from the pericardium, the oesophagus and the posterior mediastinum and pass through 8—12 posterior mediastinal glands. c) The internal thoracic lymphatics pass through 10—14 anterior mediastinal glands, also 6—8 sternal glands. They form the internal mammary plexus, which empties into the two Ductus thoracici by means of the Trunci mammarii. d) The lymphatics of the lungs, partly superficial, partly deep, pass through the bronchial glands; on the left side they run to the thoracic duct, on the right side through the Truncus broncho-mediasttnicus to the right lymphatic duct.Lymphatics. 265 618. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lower Extremity. The lymphatics of the lower extremity converge to the ingui- nal glands, which are partly superficial and partly deep, and form the inguinal plexus by a number of anastomoses. The former lie between Poupart's ligaments and the Fovea ovalis, the latter upon the vessels of the thigh. The lymphatics are the following: a) Lymphatics of the thigh. They pass partly above the Fascia lata, partly below it. The superficial ascend from the foot, pass with the great saphenous vein, partly also below the integument of the leg. The deep accompany the deep blood vessels and in the popli- teal space pass through 1 — 4 deep popliteal glands. b) The lymphatics of the hypogastric region pass down above Poupart's liga- ment, and enter the uppermost inguinal glands. c) The lymphatics of the external genitals pass from the penis or the clitoris to the adipose tissue of the Mom Veneris, from there to the superficial inguinal glands. The lymphatics of the scrotum and Labia majora pass transversely outwards to the inguinal glands. Fasa lymph, plant.Lymphatics; 266 619. The Deep Lymphatics of the Pelvis and Groin. From the inguinal glands the lymphatic trunks pass with the vessels into the pelvis, receive lymphatics from the anterior and lateral walls of the abdomen and form the external iliac plexus, which empties into the inferior lumbar glands. The hypogastric and middle sacral plexuses also empty into these glands. The hypo- gastric plexus is formed by branches, which accompany those of the hypogastric artery; the middle sacral plexus receives the lym- phatics of the posterior pelvic wall, of the sacral canal and the rectum.267 Lymphatics. 020. The Lymphatics of the Testis and Epididymis. The lymphatics of the lumbar region and the viscera form the double 1 u m b a r plexus and the single mesenteric plexus; from these the two Trunci h/m- phatici lumbales and the single Truncus lymphaticus intcstinalis are formed. a) The lumbar plexuses lie upon the muscles of the lumbar region and the lumbar portion of the spinal column and form 20—30 lumbar glands, partlj7 superior and partly inferior. Besides these plexuses the glands receive the following lymphatics: The lymphatics of the testicle from the testis and its coverings, in the female from the ovary; in the latter, the lymphatics of the fundus of the uterus and the Fallopian tubes also open; The lymphatics o f t h e k i d - n e y and suprarenal capsule; The lumbar lymphatics from the lateral abdominal wall; The lymphatics of the sig- moid flexure and r e c t u m on the left side. b) The mesenteric or coeliac plexus is single, surrounds the aorta and its upper branches, also the portal vein and forms 16— 20 coeliac g 1 a n d s. Heitzmann, Atlas II. 35268 Lymphatics. 021. The Vasa chylifera in the Mesentery. The lymphatics which form the coeliac plexus are the fol- lowing : Lymphatics of the stomach, which again form three plexuses a left, an upper and a lower; Lymphatics of the small intestine, really called lac- teals, Vasa lactea s. chylifera, run between the layers of the mesentery and pass through a triple row of mesenteric glands, Glandulae mesaraicae; Lymphatics of the rectum; they form only 1—2 rows of small glands; Lymphatics of the spleen and pancreas, running along the splenic vein; Lymphatics of the liver, superficial and deep. The super- ficial pass with the suspensory ligament of the liver from the convex sur- face of the liver to the diaphragm into the mammary and anterior mediastinal plexuses, partly also to the plexuses of the stomach and spleen, and to the posterior mediastinal glands. The deep lymphatics leave the Porta liepatis, receive the superficial lymphatics of the concave surface of the liver and form, before they open into the coeliac plexus, several hepatic gland s.269270INDEX FOR BOTH PARTS.

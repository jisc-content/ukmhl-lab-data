DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 474 diaphragm, and is then reflected on to the posterior surface of the liver, where it covers the part called the Spigelian lobe, and passes into the hinder layer of the small omentum, mesentery; The descending layer immediately passes off along the superior mesenteric vessels to the Fig. 145* iD pelvis ; Small and large bags ; small intestine (jejunum and ileum), forming the mesentery (m) as before explained in tracing the horizontal circle. From the root of the mesentery, this layer de- scends over the lower end of the aorta and the pro- montory of the sacrum to the pelvis, where it partly invests the viscera of that cavity. Thus, it sur- rounds the upper part of the rectum, and attaches that to the front of the sacrum by the meso-rec- tum ; from the rectum it is reflected forwards to the bladder in the male, or the uterus in the female, forming a pouch between the two ; and after cover- ing the upper part of the bladder, it passes off at the front and sides to the abdominal wall, forming the fossa? before noticed in the inguinal region (p. 462). Lastly, the membrane is continued upwards, lining the anterior wall of the abdomen, and the under surface of the diaphragm nearly to the spine ; there it is reflected over the upper surface of the liver, and then turning round to the under surface it joins the anterior layer of the small omentum. In the foregoing account it will be seen that two vertical circles have been traced, which surround distinct cavities in the figure. The portion of the membrane which forms the circle behind the * Diagram showing the arrangement of the peritoneum in a median section of the abdomen. I. Liver, st. Stomach, c. Transverse colon, p.

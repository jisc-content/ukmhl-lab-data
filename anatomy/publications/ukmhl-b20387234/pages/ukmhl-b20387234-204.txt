DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 188 nerve, to the opposite eye, and vice versa. And the most internal are continued through the tract of the other side back to the brain without entering the eye. Trunk of The optic nerve extends from the commissure to the eyeball, and is about one inch and a half in length. It leaves the skull by the optic foramen, where it receives its sheaths from the dura mater and arachnoid. Its course in the orbit is described on p. 46. In the eyeball it ends in the retina.

LARGE INTESTINE. 501 Compared with .small gut, larger, not coiled, sacculated with bands, In length this portion of the alimentary canal measures about length five or six feet,—one-fifth of the length of the intestinal tube. The diameter of the colon is largest at the commencement of the caecum, size, and gradually decreases as far as the upper part of the rectum : in the lower part of the rectum there is a dilatation above the anus. When compared with the small intestine, the colon is distinguished by the following characters :—It is generally of greater capacity, being in some places as large again, and is more fixed in its position ; it is also free from convolution, except in the left iliac fossa, where it forms the sigmoid flexure. Instead of being a smooth cylindrical tube, the colon is sacculated, and is marked by three longitudinal muscular bands, which alternate with as many rows of dilatations ; but in the Fig. 156.* longitudinal bands disappear. Attached to the surface, especially along the transverse colon, are small processes of peritoneum containing fat—the appen- dices epiploicae. Dissection. For the purpose of examin- ing the large intestine, the student should cut off and blow np the caecum, with part of the ileum entering it ; and he should prepare in a similar way a piece of the transverse colon, and a piece of the sigmoid flexure (about four inches of each). The areolar tissue and the fat are to be removed with care from each, after it has been inflated. The cmecum, or the head of the colon (fig. 156, a), is the rounded end of the large intestine which projects, in the form of a pouch, below the junction of the ileum with it. It measures about two inches and a half in length, and rather more in width, though gra- dually narrowing below: it is the widest part of the colon. At its inner side it is joined by the small intestine (b) ; and still lower there is a small worm-like projection (c)—the vermiform appendix. Appendix vermiformis (fig. 156, c). This little convoluted tube is attached to the lower and hinder part of the caecum, of which it was a continuation at one period in the embryo. From three to six inches in length, the appendix is rather larger than a goose-quill, and is connected to the inner side of the caecum by a fold of peri- ennitioii of caecum ; ileum and appendix.

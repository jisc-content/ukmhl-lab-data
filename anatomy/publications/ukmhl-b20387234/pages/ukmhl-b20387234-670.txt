The capsule differs much in strength, and in the arrangement of the fibres at the fore and hinder parts. On the front it is strengthened by a broad and thick layer of longitudinal fibres—the ilio-femoral ligament (fig. 200, a, c). This is fixed above, where it is about an inch broad, to the lower part of the anterior inferior iliac spine and to a rough mark continued backwards therefrom on the outer surface of the ilium immediately Fig. 2 00.* above the acetabulum. Becoming wider below, it is inserted into the whole length of the anterior intertrochanteric line ; and its fibres division : generally form two stronger bands, which are attached at the upper and lower ends respectively of the intertrochanteric line, with a thinner part in the middle : from this arrangement the name of the Y liga- and use. ment has also been given to it. From its position, the ilio-femoral ligament will arrest extension of the joint; and when the femur is fixed in standing it will support the pelvis.

396 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. Outer * The external branches increase in size from above downwards, erector6* t0 and pass beneath the longissimus dorsi to the interval between that spinse: muscle and the ilio-costalis, distributing offsets to the several divisions of the erector spinse. The branches of the upper six or seven nerves end in these muscles; but the lower five or six, after lower ones reaching the interval between the longissimus and ilio-costalis, are cutaneous continued to the surface through the serratus and latissimus muscles, nearly in a line with the angles of the ribs. Inner * The internal branches are larger above than below, and supply transCversoÂ° ^e transverso-spinales muscles. The upper six or seven are directed spiuaies: inwards between the semispinalis and multifidus spinae, and become * Deep dissection of the back of the neck. (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles: A. Rectus posticus major. B. Rectus posticus minor, c. Obliquus inferior. r>. Obliquus superior. b. Sterno-mastoid. f. Complexus, cut across, g. Semispinalis colli. Arteries : a. Occipital, and b. Its cervical branch, c. Vertebral artery, and d. Its cervical branch, e. Deep ceryical. Nerves : 1. Posterior branch of the suboccipital. 2 to 7. Inner branches of the posterior primary divisions of the respective cervical nerves.

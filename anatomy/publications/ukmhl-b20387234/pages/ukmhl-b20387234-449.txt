The description of this fascia in the male will Superficial serve for the like part in the female, with these modifications :â€”that in the female it is interrupted in the middle line, and is of less extent, in consequence of the aperture of the vulva ; and that it is continued forwards through the labia majora to the inguinal region. In the labia the superficial fascia contains involuntary muscular fibres, like Dartoid the dartos tunic of the scrotum, as well as fat. tissue.

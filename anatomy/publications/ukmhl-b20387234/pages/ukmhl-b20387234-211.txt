195 FIBRES OF MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Pyramid and anterior column. The fibres of the pyramid form a Fibres of the well-defined and independent bundle (fig. 58, a) through the whole Pyramid> extent of the medulla oblongata, and are continued below partly into the anterior column of the same side, and partly into the lateral column of the opposite half of the cord. The set of fibres keeping to the same side forms the outer portion of the pyramid, but in the anterior column of the cord, where it is known as the direct pyramidal direct, tract, it is placed close to the anterior median fissure. The decus- sating fibres are usually the more numerous, and pass obliquely and crossed, backwards, across the median fissure and behind the opposite Fig. 57.* anterior column, to enter the lateral column, where they constitute the crossed pyramidal tract. Upwards, the fibres of the pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the crusta of the cerebral peduncle (fig. 56, c, d). The fibres of the anterior column of the cord which Rest of are not continued into the pyramid incline backwards, and enter the column* reticular formation of the medulla oblongata. The decussation of the pyramids (fig. 56, 6) occupies the anterior Decussation fissure of the medulla oblongata at a distance of three-quarters of an of Pyramids- inch from the pons. It is about a quarter of an inch in length, and is generally constructed by the crossing of three or four bundles of * Deep dissection of the medulla oblongata, pons, and crus cerebri, a.

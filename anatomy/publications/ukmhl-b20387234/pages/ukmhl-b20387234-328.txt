DISSECTION OF BACK OF FOREARM. 312 insertion: and use. Dissection origin; part of the interosseous membrane. Near the wrist the tendon becomes free from muscular fibres, and passing beneath the annular ligament with the common extensor of the fingers, is applied to, and blends with the external tendon of that muscle in the expan- sion on the first phalanx of the fore finger. Until this muscle has passed the ligament it is covered by the superficial layer, but it is afterwards subaponeurotic. Action. The muscle can point the fore finger even when the three inner fingers are bent; and it will help the common extensor of the digits in drawing back the hand. Dissection. To lay bare the supinator brevis, it will be necessary bre\isinat0r to detach the anconeus from the external condyle of the humerus, and to cut through the supinator longus and the radial extensors of the wrist. After those muscles have been divided, the fleshy fibres of the supinator are to be followed forwards to their insertion into the radius ; and that part of the origin of the flexor profundus digitorum, which lies on the outer side of the insertion of the brachial is anticus, is to be removed. The supinator brevis (d) surrounds the upper part of the radius, except at the tuberosity and the front of the bone below it. It arises from the external margin of the ulna for a distance of two inches, as well as from a depression below the small sigmoid cavity ; also from the orbicular ligament of the radius and the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. The fibres pass outwards and forwards, and are inserted into the upper third or more of the radius, except at the fore and inner parts, reaching downwards to the insertion of the pronator teres, and forwards to the oblique line of the bone. The supinator brevis is concealed altogether at the posterior and external aspects of the limb by the muscles of the superficial layer; and anteriorly the radial vessels and nerve lie over it. The lower border is contiguous to the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, only the pos- terior interosseous vessels (a) intervening. Through the substance of the muscle the posterior interosseous nerve (3) winds to the back of the limb. Use. Action. "When the radius has been moved over the ulna in pronation, the short supinator comes into play to bring that bone again to the outer side of the ulna. Posterior The posterior interosseous artery (fig. 92, a)is an offset from arterySS60US ^e common interosseous trunk (p. 291), and reaches the back of the forearm above the membrane between the bones. Appearing between the contiguous borders of the supinator brevis and extensor between the ossis metacarpi pollicis, the artery descends at first between the muscles, superficial and deep layers of muscles ; and afterwards, with a and super- superficial position in the lower third of the forearm, along the ficiai: tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris as far as the wrist, where it Origin of short supi nator; and inser- tion.

DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 572 THE URETHRA AND PENIS. Urethra: extent and length ; division into parts. How to open the urethra. Urethra (fig. 178). The tube of the urethra extends from the neck of the bladder to the end of the penis, and has an average length of about eight inches ; but it is shorter by one inch during life (Thompson). It is supported by the prostate, the triangular ligament, and the spongy structure of the penis. The tube is divided, as before said (p. 550), into a prostatic, a membranous, and a spongy part. Dissection. To open the urethra, let the incision through the prostate Fig. 177.* be continued onwards to the extremity of the penis along the line of union of the urethral canal with the corpus cavernosum. Prostatic The prostatic part (fig. 177) is nearer the anterior than the part: posterior surface of the muscular mass surrounding it. It is one dimensions inch and a quarter in length, and is the widest portion of the ancl urethral canal. Its form is spindle-shaped, for it is larger in the shape; middle than at either end. Its transverse measurement at the neck diameter. of the bladder is nearly a third of an inch ; at its centre a line or two more ; and at the lower end rather less than at the beginning. On the floor Separating this part of the passage from the bladder is the emi- rs a crest: nence 0f ^he uvula vesicae. Beginning half an inch below this is a central longitudinal eminence of the mucous lining (fig. 178 d), about three-quarters of an inch in length, and larger above than below, which is prolonged towards the membranous part of the canal, and is named crest of the urethra (verumontanum, caput * Section through the bladder, prostate, and urethra, to show the vesicula prostatica and the common seminal duct. a.

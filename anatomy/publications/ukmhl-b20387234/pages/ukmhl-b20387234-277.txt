SCAPULAR MUSCLES. 261 Section II. SCAPULAE, MUSCLES, VESSELS, NERVES, AND LIGAMENTS. After the limb lias "been separated from the trunk it is to be placed with the subscapularis uppermost. Dissection. The different muscles that have been traced to the scapula in the dissection of the front of the chest and of the back are now to be followed to their insertion into the bone. A small part of each, about an inch in length, should be left for the purpose of showing the attachment. Between the larger rhomboid muscle and the serratus magnus, at the base of the scapula, run the posterior scapular artery and vein, the ramifications of which are to be traced. Fig. 77.* To the borders and the angles of the scapula the following muscles are connected :â€” From the upper mar- gin of the scapula arises one muscle, the omo- hyoid (fig. 77, e). About half an inch wide at its origin, the muscle is attached to the edge of the bone behind the notch, and sometimes to the ligament which bridges over the notch. Along the axillary margin arise the long head of the triceps (fig. 83, a), and the teres minor (h) and major (g) muscles ; these attach- ments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The vertebral border of the bone has four muscles inserted into it. Between the superior angle and the spine is the levator anguli scapulas (fig. 78, h) ; opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor (j) is attached ; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major (k) is inserted : the upper fibres of the last Position.

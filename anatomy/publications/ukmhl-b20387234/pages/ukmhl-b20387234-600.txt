584 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. The internal fibres describe circles round the openings of the Fallopian tubes, and spread from these apertures till they meet at the middle line. At the neck of the uterus they are arranged in a transverse direction. The middle or intervening set of fibres are more indistinct than the others, and have a less determinate direction. The mucous lining of the uterus is continued into the vagina at one end, and into the Fallopian tubes at the other. In the body it is thin and soft, of a reddish-white colour, smooth, and closely Fig. 183.* adherent. In the cervix it is stronger, and presents the folds before referred to. Vessels are The blood-vessels of the uterus are large and tortuous, and occupy canals in the uterine substance, in which they communicate freely Arteries. together. The arteries are furnished from the uterine and ovarian branches (p. 560). Veins. The veins correspond with the arteries ; they are of large size, and form plexuses in the uterus (p. 560). Nerves. The nerves are derived from the sympathetic (p. 565), and are very small in proportion to the size of the uterus. Lympha- Lymphatics. One set accompanies the uterine vessels to the glands two sets on ^ac artery- Another set issues from the fundus, enters the broad ligament, and accompanies the ovarian artery to the glands on the aorta : the last are joined by lymphatics of the ovary and Fallopian tube.

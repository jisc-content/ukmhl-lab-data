ACTION OF ERECTOR SPINiE. 393 splenitis and levator anguli scapulae on the outer side, and the com- plexus on the inner side, the trachelo-mastoid being next to the complexus. The cervicalis ascendens is attached to the transverse processes in a line with the splenius colli, and immediately behind the middle and posterior scalene muscles. * Action of erector spina?. These powerful muscles draw backwards Use of both or extend the spine, and come into play in bringing the column eiect01s> Fig. 121.* into, and in maintaining the erect position. The parts inserted into the dorsal vertebrae will be to some extent inspiratory muscles, since the dilatation of the thorax is aided by extension of the verte- bral column ; but the slips inserted into the ribs will draw down- wards these bones, and may thus act in forced expiration. The muscle of one side acting alone will incline the spine laterally, ^scie and The cervical prolongations have a similar action upon the neck and of portions , , in neck, head. * Dissection of the muscles beneath the splenius. A. Longissimus dorsi. B. Transversalis colli, c. Trachelo-mastoid. d. Complexus. F. Splenius capitis, cut. G. Splenius colli, cut. n. Semispinalis dorsi. a. Occipital artery. 1. Great occipital nerve. 2. External branch, of the second nerve. 3. Outer branch of the third nerve.

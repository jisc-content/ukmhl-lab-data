701 LIGAMENTS OF ANKLE-JOINT. and at the lower end, between the membrane and the inferior articulation, is another small opening for the anterior peroneal vessels. Movement. Very little movement is allowed in the tibio-peroneal ^P^" articulations, as the chief use of the fibula is to give strength and elasticity to the ankle-joint, and attachment to muscles of the leg. In the upper joint there is a slight gliding chiefly from within in upper, out. In the lower articulation the ligaments permit some yielding of the fibula to the pressure of the astragalus, as when the weight avtiCula- of the body is thrown on the inner side of the foot; but if the force tion- is violent, that bone will be fractured about the junction of the third and lowest fourths sooner than the ligaments give way. Fig. 217.* Articulation of the Ankle (fig. 217). The ankle is a hinge or Bones in ginglymoid joint, in which the upper part of the astragalus is received j^t"11^" into an arch formed by the lower ends of the tibia and fibula ; and the four ligaments belonging to this kind of articulation connect together the bones. Dissection. To make the dissection required for the ligaments of Dissection the ankle-joint, the muscles, and the fibrous tissue and vessels must ank1' be removed from the front and back of the articulation. For the purpose of defining the lateral iigaments, the limb must be placed first on one side and then on the other. The internal liga- ment is wide and strong, and lies beneath the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The external is divided into three separate pieces ; and to show these, the peronei muscles, and the remains of the annular ligament below the outer malleolus, should be taken away. * Internal lateral ligament of the ankle (altered from Bourgery). 1.

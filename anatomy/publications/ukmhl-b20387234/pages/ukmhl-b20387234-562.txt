546 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. The peri- toneum covers partly tli rectum ; with care the remains of the sheath of the vesicula seminalis, defining at the same time the vas deferens internal to the latter. The peritoneum does not envelop the viscera in the pelvis so completely as in the upper part of the abdomen. After surround- ing the upper portion of the rectum, and forming a fold (meso- rectum) behind it, the membrane covers the upper surface of the bladder, and projects for some way between the two viscera, thus giving rise to the recto-vesical pouch (fig. 145, rvp) : on eacli Fig. 170. and partly the bladder, leaving front and lower part free.

From the summit and sides of the bladder it is reflected to the wall of the pelvis and abdomen. All the front and lower part of the bladder are therefore uncovered by peritoneum ; and when the bladder is distended it rises above the pubic bones, so as to allow of its being opened in front without injury to the serous membrane. The recto-vesical pouch is wide above, where it corresponds with the interval between the iliac arteries, and is narrow below between the rectum and bladder. It descends slightly into the interval between the vesiculse seminales, and ends usualty at a line joining the spots where the ureters enter the wall of the bladder. The extent downwards of the pouch varies greatly with the condition of * Side view of the dissected male pelvis, a. Urinary bladder, h. Prostate. c. Membranous part of the urethra, d.

Extending along the upper part of each lateral region is the and lateral, obliterated hypogastric artery, which marks the extent of the peri- toneal covering at the side. The surface below this is connected with the pelvic fascia by very loose areolar tissue. The neck (cervix) is the part of the bladder near the urethra, and Neck, is surrounded by the prostate gland. This is the lowest part of the organ. When the bladder is empty, the upper wall falls upon the lower; condition the apex lies at the upper end of the pubic symphysis ; and the base bladder.7 is of very small extent and looks downwards. In a vertical section the cavity then appears as a slit, which is continued backwards for a short distance beyond the beginning of the urethra. The ureter (fig. 170, h) crosses the common or the external iliac ureter in artery, and inclines forwards below the level of the obliterated hypo- Pelvis> gastric artery, being covered by the peritoneum constituting the posterior false ligament of the bladder. It enters the bladder at the upper and outer part of the base, at the distance of one inch and a bladder, half or two inches from the prostate gland. The PROSTATE GLAND (fig. 170, 1) Surrounds the neck of the Prostate : bladder. Its shape is conical with the base turned upwards, and position; its size about equals that of a large chestnut. In the present form; position of the pelvis, a line from the apex through the middle of axis; the gland would be directed obliquely backwards and slightly down- wards towards the sacrum ; but in the erect state of the body the axis is nearly vertical. The anterior surface is about three-quarters of an inch from the relations of symphysis pubis, to which it is attached by the anterior true liga- surface1 ments of the bladder. On this surface the dorsal vein of the penis divides to enter the prostatic plexus. The 'posterior surface has the posterior greatest extent, and is close to the rectum ; this is the part that is surface> felt by the finger introduced into the bowel through the anus.

Through the gland the urethra takes its course to the perineum; and the common seminal ducts pierce it obliquely to open into the urethra (fig. 177,/).

The vesicuLjE seminales (fig. 170, g) are two small sacculated Seminal 1 >odies, each about two inches long, between the base of the bladder vesicles ; and the rectum.

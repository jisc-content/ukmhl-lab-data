By their overlapping, the articular processes also help in giving security to the spine ; and in dislocation of the vertebrae they are generally broken off. Yellow Ligaments of the arches. The ligamenta subflava are small the^nSnsef rhomboidal sheets of yellow elastic tissue, which close the intervals between the neural arches at the back of the spinal canal from the Fig. 117.* Fig. 118.+ attach- ments ; thickness.

In each interval there are two ligaments, a right and a left, which meet in the middle line, and extend from the root of the spine to the articular processes. They are attached above to the anterior or deep surface of the laminse of one vertebra, and below to the upper border and posterior surface of the laminae of the next. They are thin in the neck, and strongest in the loins. Ligaments of the spines. Along the tips of the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebra? is a longitudinal band of fibres (fig. 118, *)â€”the supraspinous ligament. It is thickest in the lumbar region ; and it consists of superficial fibres which pass over three or more spines, and deep fibres which unite adjoining bones. Many of the back muscles arise from it on each side. In the same regions there are also membranous interspinous ligaments (fig. Ill, 5) reaching from the root to the tip of the spinous processes. They are thicker and broader in the lumbar than in the dorsal part of the column. * An inner view of the neural arches of the vertebrae, with their interposed ligaments. (Bourgery.) 1 and 2.

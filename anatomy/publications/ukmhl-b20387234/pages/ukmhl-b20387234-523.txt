LOBES OF THE LIVER. 507 surface before alluded to, and the other is over the large end of the gall-bladder. Extremities. The right extremity is thick and rounded ; and the left is thin and flattened. Lobes. On the under and posterior surfaces the liver is divided primarily into two lobes, a right and a left, by the antero-posterior or longitudinal fissure ; and occupying part of the right lobe are three others, viz., the quadrate, Spigelian, and caudate lobes. The left lobe is smaller and thinner than the right ; on its posterior aspect is a groove (oesophageal groove; fig. 158, oz g) which lodges Lobes art- five, two large, and three small. Left lobe impressed by oesopha- gus and stomach. the lower end of the oesophagus, and widens out below into a hollow for the stomach (gastric impression; g i) occupying the greater part of the under surface of the lobe ; but next to the longitudinal fissure is a considerable elevation (omental tuberosity, His ; o t), which lies against the small omentum and the lesser curvature of the stomach. The right lobe forms the greater part of the liver, and is separated Right lobe from the left by the longitudinal fissure below and behind, and by P1"6861118 the suspensory ligament above.

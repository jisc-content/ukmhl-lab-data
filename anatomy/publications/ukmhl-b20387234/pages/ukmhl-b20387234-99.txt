For the display of the pterygoid muscles (fig. 19), p^y^f' it will be necessary to remove a piece of the ramus of the jaw. muscles, But the greater part of the temporal muscle is to be first de- tached from the subjacent bone with the handle of the scalpel, and the deep temporal vessels and nerves are to be sought in its fibres. A piece of the ramus is next to be taken away by sawing across saw through the bone below the condyle, and again close above the dental the jaw; foramen ; and to protect the dental vessels and nerve in contact Fig. 19.* with its inner surface while doing this, the handle of the scalpel may be inserted between them and the bone, and carried downwards to their entrance into the foramen.

In removing the fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin internal lateral ligament, which lies on the internal pterygoid muscle beneath the ramus. * Superficial view of the pterygoid region (Quain's "Arteries "). 1.

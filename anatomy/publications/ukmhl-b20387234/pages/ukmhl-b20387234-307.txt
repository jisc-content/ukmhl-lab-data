291 BRANCHES OF ULNAE ARTERY. Its brandies are muscular. anterior and On the annular ligament the artery has passed through the fascia* ^jjjjjyjj and lies close to the pisiform bone. The nlnar nerve, with its palmar uglSt.** branch, still accompanies the vessel on the inner side. Branches. The greater number of the offsets of 85 the artery are distributed to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- ing :â€” a. The anterior ulnar recurrent branch frequently arises in common with the next, and ascends on the brachialis anticus muscle, to join the branch of the anastomotic artery beneath the pronator teres. It gives offsets to the conti- guous muscles. b. The posterior ulnar recurrent branch (d), of larger size than the ante- rior, is directed beneath the flexor sublimis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. There it passes with the ulnar nerve be- tween the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the ramifica- tions of the inferior pro- funda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow-joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve. c. The interosseous artery is a short thick trunk, which is directed back- wards towards the inter- osseous membrane, and divides into anterior and posterior be afterwards followed. interos- seous, branches : the two divisions will * Dissection of the deep muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two groups of muscles.

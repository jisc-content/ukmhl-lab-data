Throughout the arm the brachial artery is superficial, being Relations covered only by the integuments and the deep fascia ; but at the.with fasci8e bend of the elbow it becomes deeper, and Fig. 81. * is crossed by the pro- /- , longation from the tendon of the biceps. Posteriorly the artery has the following mus- cular connections (fig. 82) :â€”While it is in- side the humerus it is placed over the long head of the triceps (f) for two inches, but separated partly by the musculo-spiral nerve and profunda vessels ; and over the inner head (g) of the same muscle for about an inch and a half. But when the vessel passes to the front of the bone, it lies on the insertion of the coraco- brachialis (c) and on the brachialis antic us (h). To the outer side are the coraco-brachia- lis and biceps muscles (c and b), the latter overlapping it. Veins. Yenae comites lie along the sides of the artery (fig. 82, d), encircling it with cross branches, and the me- dian-basilic vein crosses over it at the elbow. The basilic vein is near the artery, on the inner side, above ; but it is superficial to the fascia in the lower half of the arm. * Axillary and brachial arteries. (Quain's "Arteries.") 1.'

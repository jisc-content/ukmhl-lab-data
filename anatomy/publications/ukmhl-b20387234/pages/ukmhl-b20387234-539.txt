In contact with it on the right side are Sunder** the liver and the kidney ; and on the opposite side, the stomach, surface, the spleen, and the left kidney : in contact also with the pillars are the pancreas and the solar plexus with the semilunar ganglia. The thoracic surface is covered by the pleura of each side and the peri- and with cardium (p. 371). At the circumference of the midriff the fleshy At^Chment processes of origin alternate with like parts of the transversal]s of border, muscle ; but a slight interval separates the slips from the ensiform Intervals in process and seventh cartilage, and a second space exists sometimes 16 musc e' between the fibres from the last rib and the arch over the quadratus Fig. 165.* lumborum muscle. In it are certain apertures for the transmission Apertures.; of things from the thorax to the abdomen. The muscle is convex towards the chest, and concave to the Vault: abdomen. Its vault reaches higher on the right than the left side, and is constantly varying during life in respiration. In the condition of rest, as met with after death (state of expiration), extent up- the central portion is about opposite the xiphi-sternal articulation ; ^tlf.aft6r on the right side it rises to the level of the fifth, and on the left side to the sixth chondro-sternal articulation.

DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 178 Fibrous capsule. Inter- clavicular, The capsular ligament (fig. 51,1) is a stout membrane surrounding the articular portions of the bones and the fibro-cartilage. Its fibres run obliquely from the clavicle downwards and inwards to the sternum. The stronger parts in front and behind are described as the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaments. The interclavicular ligament (fig. 51,3) extends above the sternum, between the ends of the clavicles. The fibres dip into the hollow between the collar-bones, and are connected with the upper edge of the sternum. and costo- clavicular ligament. Fibro- cartilage. Attach- ments. The costoclavicular or rhomboid ligament (fig. 51,2) is a short strong band of oblique fibres, passing from the upper surface of the cartilage of the first rib to a rough mark on the under surface of the clavicle near the sternal end. In front of the ligament is the origin of the subclavius muscle. Sometimes the ligament is hollow, and contains a synovial bursa. The interarticular fibro-cartilage (fig. 51,7) will come into view by cutting the ligaments before described, and raising the clavicle. It is ovalish in form and flattened, and is thicker at the circumference than in the centre. Its upper margin is firmly united to the inner end of the clavicle ; and below, it is similarly fixed to the cartilage of the first rib. At its circumference it unites with the capsule of * Ligaments of the inner end of the clavicle, and of the cartilage of the second rib. 1. Capsule. 2. Costoclavicular ligament. 3.

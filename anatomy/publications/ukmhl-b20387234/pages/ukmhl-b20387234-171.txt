155 EXTERNAL MUSCLES OF LARYNX. an inch from the middle line ; as well as for a short distance into the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the crico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid muscle. Action. It draws the cricoid cartilage upwards and backwards, so Use. as to increase the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, and thus tightens the vocal cords. Fig. 39.* Fig. 40.t The POSTERIOR CRICO-ARYTENOID MUSCLE (fig. 40, c) arises from Posterio the depression by the side of the vertical ridge at the back of the arytenoid i cricoid cartilage. From this origin the fibres are directed out- on. back of cricoid wards and upwards, converging to their insertion into the mus- cartilage, cular process at the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Action. It draws the arytenoid cartilage downwards and outwards Use. to a slight extent, separating this from the one of the opposite side ; but its principal action is to rotate the cartilage, turning outwards the vocal process, and thus dilating the glottis. Kerato-cricoid muscle (Merkel). This is a small fleshy slip which Kerato- is occasionally seen at the lower border of the preceding muscle. cricoid" It arises from the cricoid cartilage, and is inserted into the back of the lower cornu of the thyroid cartilage. * Side view of the larynx. 1.

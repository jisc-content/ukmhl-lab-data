Above, it arises origin ; from the lower border of the annular ligament and the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis, from the trapezium and os magnum, and from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones. Below, its two insertion by heads are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of two pieces ; Fig. 88.* the thumb, the inner one being united with the adductor pollicis. A sesamoid bone is connected with each head close to its insertion. The tendon of the long flexor lies on this muscle, occupying the interval between the heads near the insertion ; and the deep palmar arch of the radial artery issues beneath the inner head. Action.

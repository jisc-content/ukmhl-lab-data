It decreases rapidly in size from above down, and is closed below. The aperture by which the space com- municates with the cavity of the abdomen is named the crural ring. parts In front of the canal are Poupart's ligament and the upper end around it. q£ fa|cjform margin of the saphenous opening; while behind it is the pectineus muscle. On the outer side of the canal, but in the sheath, is the femoral vein. Through this channel the intestine passes from the abdomen in femoral hernia. Crural ring: The crural ring is the upper opening of the crural canal. It is on a level with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 143, d), and situation is larger in the female than in the male.

The structures around the ring, outside the crural sheath, are similar to those bounding the canal, viz., in front, the superficial and the deep crural arch, and behind, the pubis covered by the * Dissection of the crural sheath (Illustrations of Dissections), a.

LIGAMENTS OF HIP-JOINT. 655 ing, through which the bursa under the ilio-psoas communicates with the joint-cavity. At the back of the capsule is a band of transverse fibres circular (fig. 201, 6), about half an inch wide, which arches like a collar Jj^ul Fig. 201.* over the neck of the femur. By its lower edge it is united to the bone by a thin layer (c) of fibrous tissue and synovial membrane ; at the upper edge it is joined by the longitudinal capsular fibres (a). It gives insertion to the longitudinal fibres of the capsule, and pre- use. vents that restriction of the swinging movement which would result from their insertion into the hinder part of the neck. Posteriorly the joint is covered by the obturator internus and Muscles gemelli muscles ; and anteriorly by the rectus femoris and ilio- around- psoas. Above is the gluteus minimus, the tendon of which is united to the capsule ; and below is the obturator externus. Dissection (fig. 202). The capsular ligament is now to be divided Cut open over the prominence of the head of the femur, and this bone being the caPsule- disarticulated but not detached, the cotyloid and interarticular liga- ments inside it will appear. The interarticular or round ligament is attached to the acetabulum Define round by two pieces ; and to bring these into view, the synovial membrane ^s3'111611*- and areolar tissue must be removed. The transverse ligament over the notch is also to be defined. * Hinder part of the capsule of the hip-joint, a. Longitudinal fibres, b. Transverse band. c.

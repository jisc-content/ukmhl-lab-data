205 FISSURE OF SYLVIUS. volutions, known as the lobes of the cerebrum, by means of some of the most constant sulci, aided by lines prolonged from these. The interlobar sulci are three in number, viz :â€” The fissure of Sylvius (fig. 60, s) begins at the vallecula Sylvii, Sylvian whence it extends transversely outwards across the under surface of SbUre the hemisphere, separating the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes (fig. 59). As soon as it reaches the outer surface, it gives off one has three small branch forwards (anterior; fig. 60, s'), and another upwards l3ranches- (ascending; s"), with project into the inferior frontal convolution, Fig. 60.* and is then continued backwards as the posterior branch (s'") through about the middle third of the hemisphere. The posterior branch separates the temporo-sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes ; it ascends somewhat as it runs backwards ; and at its termination it is bent upwards for a short distance and projects into the parietal lobe. When the brain is in the skull, the place of division of the fissure Position in of Sylvius is opposite the articulation of the great wing of the bones of sphenoid with the parietal bone. head- * Sulci and convolutions of the outer surface of the hemisphere.

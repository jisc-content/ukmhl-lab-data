The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that in the male organ (p. 576). The blood-vessels of the corpus cavernosum are like those of the penis; and the glans receives the ending of the dorsal artery (p. 440). The bulb of the vestibule (semi-bulb, Taylor; fig. 182, a) is an elongated and flattened mass of cavernous or erectile tissue, which is enclosed in a thin fibrous coat.

INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE. 265 The infraspinatus MUSCLE (fig. 78, b) occupies the infraspinous infraspina- fossa of the scapula, and extends to the upper end of the humerus, j^1*868 The muscle arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula, ^ ^ from the dorsal surface of the bone below that process, except at the name; neck and the narrow area along the axillary border where the teres muscles are attached, and from a special fascia covering it. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the middle insertion; impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and joins the Fig. 78.* tendons of the supraspinatus and teres minor. The fleshy fibres arising from the spine overlay the tendon of the muscle. A part of the muscle is subcutaneous ; but the upper portion is relations; concealed by the deltoid, and the lower angle by the latissimus dorsi. The lower border is in contact with the teres minor, with which it is often united. The muscle lies on the scapula and the scapulo-humeral articulation; and there is sometimes a small bursa between it and the capsule of the joint. Action. With the humerus hanging it acts as a rotator outwards ; and use and when the bone is raised it will move the arm backwards in concert with the hinder part of the deltoid. * View of the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and of the circumflex vessels and nerve.

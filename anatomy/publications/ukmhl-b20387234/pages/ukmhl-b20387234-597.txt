Each is about an inch and a half long, and is larger at its hinder end, where it measures size; about half an inch in depth. By their narrow anterior ends the two bulbs are united in front of the urethra; and they are joined by a venous plexus to the gggg. small glans of the clitoris. These bodies answer to the divided bulb of the corpus spongiosum urethrae in the male. GENERATIVE ORGANS. The generative or- gans, or internal organs of generation, are the uterus and vagina, and the ovaries with the Fallopian tubes. Dissection. The vis- cera are now to be separated, so that the bladder and the urethra may be together, and the vagina and the uterus remain united. The bladder is to clean be set aside for subsequent use. The surface of the vagina and vagma* the lower part of the uterus should be cleaned ; but the peritoneal investment of the latter is to be left untouched for the present. THE VAGINA The tube of the vagina (fig. 171, i) is connected with the uterus Vagina: at one end, and with the vulva at the other. It has a slightly ex en curved course between the two points mentioned ; and the anterior aud curved , . ; . , . „ . . course; and posterior walls are not equal m length, for the former measures about two inches, and the latter three. In the body the vagina is flattened from before back, so that the form opposite surfaces are in contact; and the upper part of the posterior wall is applied to the lower end of the uterus. Its size varies at and size, different spots ;—thus the external orifice, which is surrounded by the constrictor vaginae muscle, is the narrowest part; the middle portion is the largest; and the upper end is intermediate in dimen- sions between the other two.

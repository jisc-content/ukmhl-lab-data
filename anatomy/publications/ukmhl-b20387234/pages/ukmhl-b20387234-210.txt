194 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Superficial On the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata there may be fibres™1 seen, more or less distinctly in different subjects, a set of fibres crossing transversely over the upper half of the pyramid and the olivary body. These are the superficial arciform fibres, and they pass externally into the restiform body, internal Structure. The fibres of the several columns of the spinal liieciHiia6 °f corc^ eirter the medulla oblongata below, where they undergo a partial re-arrangement, and are partly continued onwards to the cerebrum and cerebellum, being joined by other fibres which take their origin in the medulla, and partly end in the grey substance of the medulla. The course of the fibres can only be shown to a very small extent by dissection, and for the complete study of the medulla oblongata 56. arrangement of the fibres, as well as of the grey matter, it is necessary to examine sections of different parts of the medulla oblongata. Dissection Dissection. To expose the connection of the pyramid with the pyramid sPmal cord, let the student turn outwards on the left side, as in fig. 56, the small part of the anterior column of the cord that remains below the decussation (for the cord has been cut through near this), and the pyramid of the right side will then be seen to divide below into two parts, one passing directly into the anterior column, and the other crossing the median fissure and disappearing in the oppo- site half of the cord. * Superficial dissection of the medulla oblongata and pons. a.

SCARPA'S TRIANGULAR. SPACE. 611 iliacus (b) ; and internally "by the pectineus and adductor longus muscles (e and f) ; and between and beneath these, near the large vessels, is a small piece of the adductor brevis. The femoral artery runs through the deepest part of the hollow, Position of lying slightly outside the centre of the space, and supplies small arterjr cutaneous offsets, as well as a large deep branch, the profunda : a small offset (external pudic) is directed from it to the scrotum across the inner boundary. On the inner side of the artery and close to it Fig. 190.* is placed the femoral vein, which is here joined by the saphenous of vein; and profunda branches. About a third of an inch external to the of anterior vessel is situate the large anterior crural nerve, which lies deeply at crurallierv * Dissection of Scarpa's triangular space (Illustrations of Dissections).

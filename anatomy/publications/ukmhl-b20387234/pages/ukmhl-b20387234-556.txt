DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 540 ami the pelvis ; and, should the perineum be undissected, the fat must be perineum; ^ken from the ischio-rectal fossa. The lower part of the pelvic fascia will now appear on the outer side of that fossa, as it covers the obturator muscle. frÂ°m outev To see the outer surface of the fascia (fig. 168), the obturator externus muscle and the obturator membrane should be removed, Fig. 168.* with the exception of a small portion of the latter at the upper end of the thyroid foramen, where it bounds the aperture through which the vessels and nerve issue. A portion of the bone is then to be cut out behind the foramen, and extending into the small sciatic * Dissection of the pelvic fascia (from a drawing by C. F. Beadles), ac. Acetabulum, o c.

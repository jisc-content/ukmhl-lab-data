389 SERRATI POSTICI MUSCLES. * The serrati muscles are very thin, and receive their name from their toothed attachment to the ribs. They are two in number, superior and inferior, and have aponeurotic origins from the spines of the vertebra. * The serratus posticus superior (fig. 120, a) arises from the liga- nientum nuchas, and from the spinous processes of the last cervical, and upper two or three dorsal vertebrae, with the supraspinous liga- ment. The fleshy fibres are inclined down and out, and are inserted hy slips into four ribs, from the second to the Fig. 120.* fifth, external to their angles. The muscle rests on the splenius, and is co- vered by the rhomboidei except at its upper border. * The serratus posticus inferior (fig. 119, G-) is wider than the preceding- muscle. Its aponeurosis of origin is inseparably united with that of the latissimus dorsi, and with the fascia lumborum, and is connected to the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and upper two or three lumbar vertebras. The fleshy fibres ascend somewhat to be inserted into the last four ribs outside their angles, each successive piece extending farther forwards than the â€¢one below. This muscle lies on the mass of the erector spinas; and with the upper border of its tendon the vertebral aponeurosis is united. Action. Both serrati are inspiratory muscles. The upper one raises the ribs into which it is inserted ; while the lower one draws backwards the lower ribs, and prevents their being carried upwards by the contraction of the diaphragm. The vertebral aponeurosis is a thin fascia which covers the fourth layer of muscles in the thoracic region. Internally it is attached to the spinous processes of the vertebras. Externally it is fixed to the angles of the ribs ; and in the intervals between the bones it joins the layer of connective tissue covering the intercostal * Part of the third and fourth layers of the muscles of the back. a.

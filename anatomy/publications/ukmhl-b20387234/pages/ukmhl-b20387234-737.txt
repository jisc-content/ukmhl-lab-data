The muscle forms a circular band, of a greyish white colour, and position; about one-tenth of an inch wide, on the surface of the choroid -pig. 225.* coat, close to the outer margin of the iris. It consists of un- striated fibres, which are in two sets, radiating and circular :— The radiating fibres (fig. 226, e) arise in front from the sclerotic coat close to the junction with the cornea (beneath r), and are directed backwards, spreading out, to be inserted into the choroid coat opposite to, and a little behind, the ciliary pro- cesses. Some of the deeper fibres become transverse, and pass gradually into the following set. The circular fibres are beneath the radiating, and form a narrow and circular bundle (fig. 226, m) surrounding the edge of the iris, opposite the fibres ; inner part of the ciliary processes. Action. The ciliary muscle draws forwards the fore part of the use. choroid coat and the ciliary processes, and relaxes the suspensory ligament of the lens, thereby allowing the lens to become more con- vex, as required for vision at near distances. The ciliary muscle is therefore the muscle of accommodation. The iris (fig. 224, c) is a vascular and muscular structure, about iris is vas- half an inch in diameter, the vessels of which are continuous with muscular • those of the choroid coat.

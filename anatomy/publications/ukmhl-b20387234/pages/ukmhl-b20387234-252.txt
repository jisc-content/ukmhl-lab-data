DISSECTION OF THE CEREBELLUM. 236 u^er half ^n nillc^er Part °^ tne Pons? an(l beneath the upper half of the arefive1'1 floor of the ventricle, are nuclei of the fifth (two), sixth, seventh and nuclei, viz., eighth nerves, but only that of the sixth is indicated by a superficial of sixth, prominence. The nucleus of the sixth (VI) lies beneath the elevation .seventh, of the fasciculus teres above the auditory strise. The facial nucleus two of fifth, (VII) is placed external to and deeper than the last ; and the motor nucleus of the fifth nerve (Vm) is above that of the facial. The sensory nucleus of the fifth (Vs) lies external to the foregoing, and just beyond the lateral margin of the ventricle, and outer The outer auditory nucleus (VIIIo) is situate at the lateral angle of eighth. o£ tjie verL^ricle, close above the auditory strise. in mid-brain Above the fourth ventricle, in the grey matter surrounding the viz?,eofUClei' aqueduct of Sylvius, are the nuclei of the fourth (IV) and third (III) fourth and nerves ^n tne fl°or5 an^ the nucleus of the descending root of the fifth fifth nerves.

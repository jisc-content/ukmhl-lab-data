DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 482 c. The superior hcemorrhoidal artery (e) crosses over the left com- mon iliac vessels, and enters between the layers of the meso-rectum, to be distributed to the lower end of the large intestine : it will be described in the dissection of the pelvis. The inferior mesenteric vein (fig. 150, d) begins in the part of the large intestine to which its companion artery is distributed, and ascends over the psoas muscle higher than the origin of the artery. Passing beneath the pancreas, the vein inclines to the right, and Fig. 148.* opens into the superior mesenteric trunk at its junction with the termination, splenic, or sometimes into the splenic vein. No valves Both mesenteric veins are without valves, and may be injected m vems. from trunk to the branches, like an artery. Lymphatic Lymphatic glands are ranged along the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure. The absorbents of the intestine, after passing through these glands, enter the left lumbar lymphatic glands.

135 SPONGY BONES AND MEATUSES. pterygoid plate of the sphenoid ; of these, the nasal, lachrymal, and formed of ethmoid reach only about half way from roof to floor, and the many ones' inferior turbinate is confined to the lower half, while the others extend the whole depth. In front of the bones, the lateral cartilages complete this boundary. From this wall three slightly convoluted osseous plates, named is irregular turbinate or spongy bones (fig. 32), project into the cavity :â€”the presents06' upPer (J) and middle (2) are processes of the ethmoid, but the lower spongy one (3) is a separate bone. The turbinate bones are confined to that bones portion of the outer wall which is situate above the hard palate. hollows Between each turbinate bone and the wall of the nose is a longitudinal hollow or meatus; and into these hollows the nasal duct and the sinuses of the surrounding bones open. The meatuses are the spaces arched over by the spongy bones ; and Meatuses, as the bones are limited to a certain part of the outer wall, so are the spaces beneath them. The upper meatus (fig. 32,6) is the smallest and straightest of the Upper three, and is limited to the posterior half of the space above the meatus- hard palate. Into its fore part the posterior ethmoidal cells open ; and at its posterior end, in the dried skull, is the spheno-palatine foramen by which nerves and vessels enter the nose. The middle meatus (fig. 32,7) is longer than the upper, reaching Middle from the posterior opening of the nasal fossa, nearly as far forwards meatus- * Outer wall of the nasal cavity. 1.

Lastly, the fibres of the muscle are to be detached at their origin ; remove and the inner piece may be removed entirely by cutting through onÂ§in' Fig. 195. the vessels and nerves that enter it. In doing this the sacral nerves JjfjJjjJJf!1 are to be dissected out of the fleshy fibres, and to be followed to the nerves, surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they will be after- wards seen. * Second view of the dissection of the buttock (Illustrations of Dissections).

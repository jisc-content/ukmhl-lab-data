Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of communication from the supratrochlear nerve. Nasal nerve In the nose (fig. 34). While in the nasal cavity the nerve fur- in the nose, joshes branches to the lining membrane of the septum and outer Fig. 11.* wall; these will be subsequently referred to with the nerves of the nose (p. 142). and in the Termination of the nasal nerve (fig. 9). After the nerve becomes face. cutaneous on the side of the nose, as seen in the dissection of the facial nerve (p. 36), it descends beneath the compressor naris muscle, and ends in the integuments of the tip of the nose.

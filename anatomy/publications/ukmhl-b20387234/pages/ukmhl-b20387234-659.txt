643 INTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. Dissection (fig. 197). The qnadratus and the gemelli muscles may ^dr|tus be now cut across, in order that their small nerve and artery, the and gemelli. ending of the internal circumflex artery, and the obturator externus may be dissected out.

One (ascending ; g) artery runs beneath the quadratus (in this position of the body) to the pit * Third view of the dissection of the buttock (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: A.

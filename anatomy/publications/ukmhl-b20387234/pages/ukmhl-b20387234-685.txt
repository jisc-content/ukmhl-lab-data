INTERNAL ANNULAR LIGAMENT. 669 artery; but its position to the vessel changes, for it lies on the inner side above the origin of the peroneal offset, but thence to the termination, on the outer side. Its branches are muscular and branches cutaneous. Muscular branches are furnished to the two long flexors, the tibi- to muscles, alis posticus, and the soleus. There is an offset for each of the muscles ; and they may arise either separately along the trunk, or together from the upper end of the nerve. The branch to the tibialis is the largest; and that to the flexor hallucis lies on the peroneal artery. A cutaneous nerve of the sole of the foot (calcaneo-plantar ; fig. 205,4) skin begins above the ankle, and piercing the internal annular ligament and sole, as two or more pieces, ends in the integuments of the inner and under parts of the heel : this nerve will be followed to its termina- tion in the dissection of the foot (fig. 206). The internal annular ligament stretches between the heel and internal the inner ankle, and serves to confine the tendons of the deep layer of lament: muscles of the foot and toes. Attached by a narrow part to the internal malleolus, the fibres diverge, and are inserted into the os calcis. One border (upper) is continuous with the fascia of the attach- leg; and the opposite gives attachment to the abductor hallucis ments- muscle of the foot. Beneath it are sheaths for the tendons. The innermost encloses Sheaths: the tibialis posticus, lodged in a groove on the back of the malleolus, their Immediately outside this is another space for the flexor digitorum.

Between the tendons of the two flexors of the digits are placed the tibial vessels and nerve. Section V. SOLE OF THE FOOT. Position.

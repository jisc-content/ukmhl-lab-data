592 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. borum is attached ; and its posterior surface is covered by the quad- rat us lumborum. Use. This ligament supports the upright moveable portion of the spinal column, and resists the tendency of the last lumbar vertebra to slip forwards over the inclined base of the sacrum. Pubic Articulation (symphysis pubis; fig. 186, a). The two pubic bones are united by an interpubic disc, by ligamentous fibres in front and above, and by a strong subpubic ligament. The anterior pubic ligament is composed of interlacing fibres Fig. 186.* which are mixed with fibres of the tendon of the external oblique muscle. There is not any definite posterior band ; but the periosteum is thickened by a few scattered fibres. The superior ligamentous fibres fill the interval between the bones above the disc. The subpubic ligament (ligamentum arcuatum; fig. 186, d) is a strong triangular band occupying the angular interval between the pubic rami at the lower part of the symphysis. Its apex is con- tinuous with the fibrous portion of the interpubic disc ; its base is free and concave, and forms the summit of the subpubic arch. * Ligaments of the symphysis pubis, thyroid hole, and acetabulum, a.

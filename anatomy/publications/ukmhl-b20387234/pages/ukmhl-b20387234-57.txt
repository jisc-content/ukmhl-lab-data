OPHTHALMIC NERVE. 41 separate canal of the dura mater, is directed forwards in the outer part of the cavity, and beneath the lachrymal gland to the upper eyelid, where it pierces the palpebral fascia, and is distributed ends in to the structures of the lid. eyelid: The nerve furnishes branches to the lachrymal gland : and near offset joins superior maxillary. the gland it sends downwards one or two small filaments (6) to join the temporo-malar branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The nasal nerve is not fully seen at this stage of the dissection, Nasal, after- and will be noticed later (p. 43). wards- Dissection. Divide the frontal nerve about its middle, and throw Dissection, the ends forwards and backwards : by raising the posterior piece of the nerve, the separate origin of the nasal branch from the ophthalmic trunk will appear. The lachrymal nerve may remain uncut. The LEVATOR PALPEBR^E SUPERIORIS (fig. 10, B) is the most Elevator superficial muscle, and is attached posteriorly to the roof of the gy^id,61 orbit in front of the optic foramen. The muscle widens in front, * First view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:—A. Su- perior oblique. b. Levator palpebral o. External rectus. d. Superior rectus, f. Lachrymal gland.

MOVEMENTS IN ANKLE-JOINT. 703 Movements. Only the movements of flexion and extension are per- Kinds of mitted in the ankle; in the former state the toes are raised towards motlon- the fore part of the leg; and in the latter, they are pointed towards the ground. Inflexion the astragalus moves backwards so as to project behind; Flexion: and the motion is arrested by the wide part of the astragalus being m0VinT wedged in between the malleoli. hone; The posterior ligament is stretched over the projecting astragalus, state of and the posterior and middle pieces of the external lateral, and the kg*111611*3- posterior part of the internal lateral ligament, are made tense.

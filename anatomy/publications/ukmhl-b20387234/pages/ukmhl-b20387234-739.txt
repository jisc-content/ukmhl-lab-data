CILIARY VESSELS AND NERVES. 723 The arteries of the iris (fig. 227, b) have a looped arrangement: Arteries they are derived chiefly from the long and the anterior ciliary c<irdesW branches (d), but some come from the vessels of the ciliary processes. On arriving at the ciliary muscle, the long and anterior ciliary arteries form a circle (e) round the margin of the iris ; from this ring other anastomotic branches are directed towards the pupil, near which they join in a second arterial circle (/). From the last circle capillaries run to the edge of the pupil, and end in veins. Fie. 227. The veins resemble the arteries Veins, in their arrangement in the iris, and terminate in the veins of the choroid coat. The nerves of the iris are the terminal branches of the ciliary nerves : they divide into branches which accompany the blood-vessels, and communicate with one another so as to form a plexus which gets gradually finer towards the pupil (fig. 227, a). Ciliary vessels and nerves (fig. 224). The ciliary arteries are offsets of the ophthalmic (p. 45), and supply the choroid, the ciliary processes, and the iris. They are classed into posterior and anterior, and two of the first set are named long ciliary; but they will not be seen without a special injection of the vessels of the eye. The posterior ciliary arteries (g) pierce the sclerotic coat around posterior and close to the optic nerve, and running forwards on the choroid, Clliary' divide into branches which enter its substance at different points. Two of this set (long ciliary) are directed forwards between the two of them sclerotic and choroid, one on each side of the eyeball, and form a cmary,l0nS circle round the iris in the ciliary muscle, as before explained. In the ball the outer one lies rather above, and the inner, rather below the middle. The anterior ciliary arteries, five or six in number, are smaller anterior ciiicirv than the posterior, and arise at the front of the orbit from muscular branches (p. 46) ; they pierce the sclerotic coat about a line behind the cornea, supply the ciliary processes, and join the circle of the long ciliary vessels. In inflammation of the iris these vessels are enlarged, and offsets of them form a ring round the cornea. The posterior ciliary veins have a different arrangement from the Veins are arteries.

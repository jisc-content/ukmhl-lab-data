OSSEOUS LABYEINTH. 741 which is pierced by minute apertures for nerves and vessels, and corresponds with the bottom of the internal auditory meatus. Be- hind the crest of bone, near the common opening of two of the ^ndta^ ^' semicircular canals, is the aperture of the aqueduct of the vestibule (c), a narrow canal which ends on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it contains a process of the membra- nous labyrinth called the ductus endolymphaticus, and a small vein. Fig. 236.* The roof is occupied by a slight transversely oval depression, fossa in roof. fovea hemielliptica; this is separated from the fovea hemispherica by a prolongation of the crest (b) on the inner wall. The semicircular canals (fig. 237) are three osseous tubes, J^^?â„¢1* which are situate behind the vestibule, and are named from their canals: form. Dissection. These small canals will be easily brought into view preparation by the removal of the surrounding bone by means of a file or bone of them' forceps. Two may be seen opening near the aperture made in the vestibule, and may be followed thence ; but the third is altogether towards the posterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canals are unequal in length, and each forms more than half length; an ellipse. They communicate at each end with the vestibule, but termination the contiguous ends of two are blended together so as to give only J^fTe open" five openings into that cavity. Each is marked by one dilated one end extremity which is called the ampulla.

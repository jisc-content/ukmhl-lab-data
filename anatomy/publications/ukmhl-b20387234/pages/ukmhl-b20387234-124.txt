(p. 113) ; but its large ganglion near the skull (upper cervical) should be cleaned, and the branches from it to the pharyngeal plexus should be pursued beneath the carotid artery. Ninth, tenth The ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves (glosso-pharyngeal, nervedV6nth Pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory) leave the cranium together by the jugular foramen (p. 19), from which circumstance they were formerly grouped together as one nerve—the eighth nerve of Willis. Outside the skull the nerves take different directions to their destination ; thus the glosso-pharyngeal is inclined forwards to the tongue and pharynx ; the spinal accessory backwards to the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles ; and the pneumo-gastric nerve descends to the viscera of the thorax and abdomen. Giosso-pha- The glosso-pharyngeal NERVE (fig. 27,1) is the smallest of the nerve'11 three trunks. In the jugular foramen it is placed somewhat in front of the other two, and lies in a groove in the hinder border of has two the petrous part of the temporal bone. In the aperture of exit the nerve is marked by two ganglionic swellings, the upper one being the jugular, and the lower the petrous ganglion. Its upper The jugular ganglion (4) is very small, and is situate at the upper end of the osseous groove containing the nerve. It includes only the outer fibres of the nerve, and is not always to be recognised, and lower The petrous ganglion (5) is much larger, and encloses all the fibrils of the nerve. Ovalish in form, it is placed in a hollow in the posterior border of the temporal bone ; and from it spring the branches that unite the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves. In the neck After the nerve has quitted the foramen, it comes forwards between the jugular vein and the carotid artery (fig. 26,1), and descends over the artery until it reaches the hinder border of the courses to stylo-pharyngeus muscle. Then curving forwards, it becomes almost the tongue, transverse in direction, crosses the stylo-pharyngeus, and finally passes beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, where it ends in branches to the tongue. Branches to The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal may be classed into those connecting it with other nerves at the base of the skull, and those distributed in the neck, with others, The connecting branches arise from the petrous ganglion ; and in this set is the tympanic nerve.

Sometimes there is an offset from the ganglion to the auricular branch of the vagus, and another to the upper ganglion of this nerve, facial and * The tympanic branch (nerve of Jacobson—fig. 27,6) enters the aperture in the ridge of bone between the jugular and the carotid foramina, and ascends by a special canal to the inner wall of the tympanum : its distribution is given with the anatomy of the middle ear (Chapter XI).

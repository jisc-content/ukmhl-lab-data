SCLEROTIC COAT. 717 Fibrous Coat of the Eyeball. The outer casing of the eye consists of an opaque hinder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior transparent portion, the cornea. The sclerotic is the firm, whitish, opaque portion of the outer coat of the eyeball, which supports the more delicate structures within. Dissection. To examine the inner and outer surfaces of this layer, Fig. 223.* Fibrous coat. Sclerotic part. Dissection to see the interior. it will he necessary to cut circularly with a scissors through the cornea close to the sclerotic, and to remove the cornea from the front of the eyeball; on piercing the cornea the aqueous fluid escapes from the containing chamber. The other structures may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 223, a) extends from the Extent of entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming sclerotlc > about five-sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one-tenth apertures of an inch), the optic nerve (I) is transmitted through an aperture behmd' in it : this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cribriform when the nerve is drawn out,â€”the lattice-like condition being due to the bundles of fibrous tissue between the funiculi of * Diagram of a horizontal section of the eyeball, a.

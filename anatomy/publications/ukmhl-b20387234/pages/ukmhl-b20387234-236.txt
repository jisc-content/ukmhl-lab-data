220 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. in front °^ ^e sPace are the anterior commissure (c) and the lamina cinerea. and beh'ind. Behind are the posterior commissure (e) and the pineal body (y). Crossing the centre of the ventricle, from one optic thalamus to the other, is a band of grey matter—the soft commissure (rf). This space communicates with the other ventricles of the brain in the following way :—In front it joins each lateral ventricle * View of the third and fourth ventricles ; the former being exposed by the removal of the velum interpositum ; and the latter by dividing vertically the worm of the cerebellum. (From a model in the Museum of University College.) The third ventricle is the interval in the middle line between the optic thalami, b. a. Caudate nucleus. b. Optic thalamus. c Anterior commissure, seen between the anterior crura of the fornix, d. Middle or soft commissure. c. Posterior commissure. /. Pineal stria, g. Pineal body. It and i.

207 INSULA AND FRONTAL LOBE. margins of the Sylvian fissure "be drawn asunder, it will be seen to have a triangular form, with the apex directed downwards towards the anterior perforated space, and to be bounded by three furrows, the sulci of Reil (ar, er, and pr), the hinder of which is continuous with the posterior branch surrounded by three sulci of Reil. Fig. 61.* Operculum of the insula. of the fissure of Sylvius. The central lobe is placed opposite the corpus stria- tum in the interior of the hemisphere. To the portions of the frontal and parietal lobes which are placed between the ascending and posterior branches of the fissure of Sylvius (fig. 60, between s" and s"), and cover the upper part of the central lobe, the name operculum of the insula is given (fig. 61). Sulci and convolu- tions OF THE FRONTAL lobe. On the outer surface of the frontal lobe there are four convolutions, separated by three sulci. The prcecentral sulcus Frontal (fig. 60, pr c) is placed in \ \ £™ front of, and nearly parallel ' fongiW° to, the lower half of the tudinal. furrow of Rolando. From it the inferior frontal sulcus (if) runs forwards and downwards, towards the orbital surface of the lobe. Above this, the superior frontal sulcus (sf), which is often inter- rupted once or twice by cross gyri, takes a similar course. The ascending frontal convolution (af) is simple, and forms the Frontal con- hindmost part of the frontal lobe, extending from the upper margin transverse- of the hemisphere to the Sylvian fissure, along the front of the fur- row of Rolando. From its fore part the three longitudinal convolu- tions of this lobe take their origin. The superior frontal convolution (sf) is longer and broader than the superior, others, and is commonly much subdivided into secondary gyri. It lies between the margin of the hemisphere and the upper frontal sulcus. * Orbital lobule and central lobe. orb. Orbital sulcus. ol. Olfactory sulcus. ar. Anterior, er. External, and pr.

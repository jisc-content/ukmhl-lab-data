INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 305 The interosseous muscles, so named from their position between Seven inter- osseous the metacarpal bones, are seven in number. Two muscles occupy muscles, each space, except the first, where there is only one. They arise from the metacarpal bones, and are inserted into the first phalanges of the fingers. They are divided into palmar and dorsal ; but all are seen divided into in the palm of the hand, though the former project more than the dorsal™" others. The palmar muscles (fig. 89), three in number, are smaller than the dorsal, and have each a single origin from the side of the ring aud' little fingers. Fig. 89.* Fig. 90. t metacarpal bone of the finger to which it belongs. The first is placed on the ulnar side of the index finger, the second and third on the radial side of the ring and little fingers respectively. The dorsal muscles (fig. 90), one in each space, arise by two heads Dorsal: two from the lateral surfaces of the metacarpal bones between which they ^"er^one lie. The first (abductor indicis) is inserted on the radial side of each ' the index finger, the second on the radial, and the third on the and rmrr ulnar side of the middle finger, and the fourth on the ulnar side of fingers, the ring finger. Both sets of muscles have a similar termination (fig. 86, b) :— Common The fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted into the side of the first ™0ste1[tsle"sof or metacarpal phalanx, and sends an expansion to join the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the bone.

They bend the metacarpophalangeal joints by their Action as attachment to the first phalanx, and extend the two interphalangeal extensorsd joints through their union with the extensor tendon. * The three palmar interosseous muscles, a.

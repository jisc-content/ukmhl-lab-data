The part in front of the genu is named the anterior limb (ica), and the longer part behind is the posterior limb (icp) of the Fig. 66.* capsule, The internal capsule is formed in large part by the fibres of the crusta of the cms cerebri coursing upwards to the medullary centre of the hemisphere, but many fibres are added from the nuclei on each side. The pyramidal fibres, which have been traced from the medulla oblongata through the pons (p. 199), and crusta (p. 202), occupy the anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb.

DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 640 largest are furnished to parts beyond the gluteal region, but some are distributed to the muscles at the back of the pelvis. Inferior The inferior gluteal nerve is larger than the superior, and gluteust0 arises from the upper part of the sacral plexus (fig. 196, ig). The maximus. short trunk is directed backwards below the pyriformis, and divides- Fig. 196.* into numerous branches which radiate upwards and downwards, and enter the gluteus maximus midway between its origin and insertion. Small sciatic The small sciatic (fig. 195,3) is a cutaneous nerve of the back cms nerve*" °f tne thigh. It springs from the second and third sacral nerves (fig. 196, ss), and takes the course of the sciatic artery as far as the lower border of the great gluteus, where it gives many cutaneous branches. Much diminished in size at that spot, the nerve is con- tinued along the back of the thigh beneath the fascia, and ends * Diagram of the sacral plexus from behind. LSC.

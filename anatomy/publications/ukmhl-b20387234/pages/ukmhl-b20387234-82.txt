66 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. of brachial The outer part of the subclavian artery having been already plexus, prepared, let the dissector remove more completely the fibrous tissue from the nerves of the brachial plexus. From the plexus trace the small branch to the subclavius muscle, and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles, which pierce the middle scalenus. Fig. 16.* If it is thought necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied, of cervical Clean the cervical plexus, and seek its muscular branches, the plexus. small twigs to join the descendens noni, and the roots of the phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the middle scalenus muscle be defined, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. * Aview of the common carotid and subclavian arteries (Quain's" Arteries"). 1.

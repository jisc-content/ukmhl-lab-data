Lastly, in front of this ridge, and close to the roof in the fore part of the cavity, is the ending of the canal and canal for the tensor tympani muscle (ctt). The canal is separated from tympani. Eustachian tube (et) below it by a thin plate of bone named the cochleariform process ; this becomes expanded on reaching the Fig. 231.* tympanic cavity, and being bent upwards, prolongs the canal beyond the end of the Eustachian tube. In most cases the outer wall of the tympanic portion of the canal is partly formed by fibrous tissue. The aperture by which the tendon of the muscle escapes is placed a little above and in front of the fenestra ovalis. On outer The outer boundary of the cavity is formed by the membrana membrana tylnPan^ (%• ^30, c), and the surrounding bone. Above and in tympani front of the membrane, is the upper opening of the Glaserian fissure, rian fissure wni°h is occupied in the fresh condition by the long process of one * Inner wall of the left tympanum : three times the natural size. pr.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 456 boundaries in front, being placed above, and nearly parallel to, the inner half of Pou- part's ligament. Towards the surface of the body the canal is bounded by the integuments and the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle (a) for its whole extent, and by the internal oblique (b) in addition for and behind ; the outer third. Towards the cavity of the abdomen its wall is similarly formed by the peritoneum, subperitoneal tissue and trans- versalis fascia (g) throughout its whole length, and by the Fig. 142. floor, and roof.

Along the lower part, or the floor, the canal is limited by the meeting of the transversalis fascia with Poupart's ligament, and by the fibres of the ligament inserted into the pectineal line (Gim- bernat's ligament) ; while along the upper part its extent is determined only by the apposition of the muscles, and by the arched borders of the internal oblique and transversalis. In the female, the canal has the same boundaries, but is usually * Dissection for inguinal hernia (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles, fyc. ; A. External oblique tendon, thrown down. B.

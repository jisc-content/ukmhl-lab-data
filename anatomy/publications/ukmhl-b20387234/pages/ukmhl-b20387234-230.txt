The cavities of the two sides approach one another in front, where they are only separated Fig. 63.* by the thin septum lucidum ; and below the hinder part of that partition, each communicates with the third ventricle by an aperture known as the foramen of Monro. At the back there is a wider interval between them. The roof of the space is formed in its whole extent by the fibres of the corpus callosum passing outwards to the convolutions; in the floor are numerous objects which will be enumerated in connection with the several parts of the ventricle. Subdivision. The ventricle consists of a central part or body, and three processes or cornua, anterior, posterior, and middle or inferior. * View of the lateral ventricles : on the left side the descending cornu is laid open.

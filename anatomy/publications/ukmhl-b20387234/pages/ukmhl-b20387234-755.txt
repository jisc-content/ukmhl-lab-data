NERVES OF TYMPANUM. 739 The TYMPANIC BRANCH OF THE GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE J^f""0 (fig. 235,2 ; nerve of Jacobson, p. 108) enters a special aperture in the temporal bone (fig. 230, ct), to reach the inner wall of the tym- supplies panum. In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining membrane, membrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Fig. 235.* Eustachian tube ; and it terminates in the three undermentioned and other branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and e ' connect this nerve with others. Branches. One branch is arched forwards and downwards, and one to sym- enters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (3) Pathetic> on the artery (p. 114). > The second (5) is the small deep petrosal nerve, which is directed small deep forwards through a canal beneath the cochleariform process, to join uerve!^ the carotid plexus of the sympathetic (sometimes also the large superficial petrosal nerve) in the foramen lacerum. And the third (4) has the following course :â€”It ascends in front and small of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on the petrol?*1 facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments (fig. 35). Be- yond the union with the facial, the nerve is named small superficial * Jacobson's nerve in the tympanum (Breschet). a. Carotid artery, b. Tensor tympani muscle, c.

In this edition of the Demonstrations of Anatomy, the plan and arrangement of the work, as explained in former editions, have not been altered; but the description of the minute structure of the viscera and sense-organs has been omitted, in view of the increased facilities which exist at the present day for the study of microscopic Anatomy. The figures illustrating the text have been added to by the introduction of thirteen new woodcuts. In carrying out the revision of the text, I have endeavoured to maintain the efficiency of the work as a guide to the acquisition of knowledge by practical study. September, 1887. G. D.

CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTEENAL PAKTS OF THE HEAD. Directions. In the dissection of the head and neck, the student Parts to he should endeavour to learn the parts described in the first fifty- the^ody'i's seven pages, before the position of the body is changed ; but if want turned, of time necessitates the omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 35) can be best deferred till a subsecpient stage. The exterior and the interior of the head, the orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck should be examined while the body lies in its first position on the back. The student begins with the dissection of the muscles of the scalp and ear. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Position. The body lying on the back, raise the head to a suitable Position of height, and turn the face to the right side. Extrinsic Muscles of the Ear. Three muscles pass to the Muscles of auricle from the side of the head. Two are above it,—one eleva- the ear' ting, the other drawing it forwards ; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards noticed (p. 34). Dissection. When the auricle has been drawn down by hooks, Dissection the position of the upper muscle will be indicated by a slight muflofesj prominence between it and the head. A horizontal incision, about three inches in length, is to be made through the skin close above the ear, and from the centre of this another cut is to'be carried up- above mentioned for a similar flaps of skin between these cuts wards along the cutaneous ridge distance. By carefully raising the from below upwards, and removing a little areolar tissue, a thin fan-shaped layer of pale muscular fibres will come into view, the-DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 2 of posterior muscle.

On drawing forwards the ear, a ridge marks the situation of the posterior muscle. To remove the integuments, let the scalpel lie carried downwards about an inch behind the ear, from the trans- verse cut above as far as to a level with the lobule of the ear, and then forwards below the lobule. After the piece of skin included by those cuts has been reflected towards the ear, the retrahent muscle must be sought beneath the subcutaneous tissue ; it consists of rounded bundles of fibres, and is stronger and deeper than the others. The attrahens aurem (fig. 1, 10) is a small fan-shaped muscle, and arises from the fore part of the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis. Its fibres are directed downwards and backwards, and are inserted into a projection on the front of the rim of the ear. Beneath it are the superficial temporal vessels and nerve. The attollens aurem (fig. 1, 15) has the same form as the preceding, though its fibres are longer and better marked. Arising also from the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the fibres converge to their insertion into the inner or cranial surface of the pinna of the ear,—into an eminence corresponding with a fossa (that of the antihelix) on the opposite aspect. The retrahens AUREM (fig. 1, '') consists of two or three roundish but separate bundles of fibres, which are stronger than those of the other muscles. The bundles arise from the root of the mastoid process, and pass almost horizontally forwards to be inserted by tendinous fibres into the lower part of the ear (concha) at its cranial aspect. The auricular branches of the posterior auricular artery and nerve are in contact with this muscle. Action. The three preceding muscles will move the outer ear" slightly in the directions indicated by their names : the anterior drawing it upwards and forwards, the middle one upwards, and the posterior backwards. The occipito-frontalis muscle (fig. 1, l\4), covers the greater part of the vault of the skull, and consists of anterior and posterior fleshy parts with an intervening aponeurotic tendon. Dissection. To expose the occipito-frontalis, the transverse incision already made on the side of the head is to be prolonged above the eyebrow to the root of the nose, and from the latter spot a cut is to be carried backwards along the middle line of the head to the ex- ternal occipital protuberance. The flap of skin, thus marked out, is to be raised from before back with the subjacent fat; while doing this the dissector will meet first with the anterior fleshy part of the muscle, next with a white shining thin aponeurosis, and lastly with the posterior fleshy belly towards the lateral aspect of the cranium. The aponeurosis of the muscle is easily taken away with the granular fat superficial to it; and if the under surface of the flap presents a white instead of a yellow appearance, the student may suspect he is removing that, membrane. The posterior or occipital part (4) arises from the outer half or two-3 OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS MUSCLE. thirds of the upper curved line of the occipital bone, and from the Ocetpitjl. mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The fibres are about one inch ^ 'eSdmg. and a half in length, and ascend to the aponeurosis. The anterior or frontal part (') forms a thin layer which covers Frontal about the lower two-thirds of the frontal bone. Its fibres are paler ^ at_ than those of the occipital part, and spring from the aponeurosis tacho.,1. Fig. 1:* some distance belbWthe line of the coronal suture. They descend to the eyebrow and root of the nose, where they interlace with the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, comvgator supercilii and pyramidal is nasi muscles, and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue. Some fasciculi are frequently attached to the nasal bone internally, - and to the external angular process of the frontal bone on 'the outer- side. The right and left muscular portions meet at the lower part of the forehead. ) . i. '■ ' " • - " l.:-.::t i",M A The tendon or epicranial aponeurosis covers the upper pact of the Aponcu- cranium, and is continuous across the middle line with the like ,08IS structure of tin- opposite half of the head.

Its deep surface is connected to the pericranium only by a loose areolar tissue devoid of fat, so that the scalp moves freely over the skull. By making a transverse incision through the aponeurosis above the ear and separating it from the pericranium towards the side of the head, it will be seen to be joined by a thin membrane, which springs from the skull above the temporal line, and descends, closely united to the deep surface of the attollens aurem muscle, over the temporal fascia to be attached to the pinna of the ear. Action. When the anterior belly contracts it raises the eyebrow, smootliing the skin at the root of the nose, and wrinkling transversely that of the forehead ; and continuing to contract, it draws forward the scalp. The posterior belly will move back the scalp ; and the bellies acting in succession can carry the hairy scalp forwards and backwards. Dissection. After the removal of the upper auricular muscles and the temporal vessels, together with the epicranial aponeurosis and its lateral prolongation, the attachment of the temporal fascia on the side of the head may be seen. The temporal fascia is a white shining membrane, which is stronger than the epicranial aponeurosis, and gives attachment to the subjacent temporal muscle. Superiorly it is inserted into the curved line that limits the temporal fossa on the side of the skull; and inferiorly, where it is narrower and thicker, it is fixed to the zygomatic arch. By its cutaneous surface the fascia is in contact with the muscles already examined, and with the superficial temporal Aressels and nerves. An incision in the fascia, a little above the 2ygoma, will show it to consist there of two layers, which are fixed to the edges of the upper border of the zygomatic arch. Between the layers is some fatty tissue, with a small branch of the superficial temporal artery, and a slender twig of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve with an accompanying artery. Dissection. The temporal fascia is now to be detached from the skull, and to be thrown clown to the zygomatic arch,, in order that the origin of the underlying temporal muscle may be examined. A soft areolar tissue which lies beneath it near the zygoma is to be taken away. The difference in thickness of parts of the fascia will be evident. The temporal muscle is laid bare only in part. Wide and thin above, it becomes narrower and thicker at the lower end. The muscle arises from the temporal fascia, and from the surface of the impression on the side of the skull, which is named the temporal fossa. From this origin the fibres descend, converging to a tendon, which is inserted into the margins and inner surface of the coronoid process of the lower jaw (p. 82). On the cutaneous surface is the temporal fascia, with the parts superficial to that membrane ; and concealed by the muscle are the deep temporal vessels and nerves which ramify in it. The insertion5 CUTANEOUS AETEJRIES. of the muscle will be seen, and its action explained, in the dissection of the pterygoid region. Dissection. For the dissection of the vessels and nerves, let How to the face he now turned to the left side, and let an incision be bright"" carried along the eyebrow and the zygomatic arch to a little behind skle- the ear, so as to allow the skin on the right half of the head to be reflected. The flap of the skin is to be raised from before backwards, but the subcutaneous fat should be left till the nerves are found. Behind the ear the skin should be raised as on the other side, to uncover the posterior auricular vessels and nerve. Along the eyebrow seek the branches of vessels and nerves seek nerves which come from the orbit (fig. 2), viz., the supraorbital vessels ^dt^|ssels and nerve about the middle, and the supratrochlear nerve and forehead, frontal vessels near the inner angle of the orbit; they lie at first beneath the muscular fibres of the frontalis, which must be cut through to find them. On the side of the head, in front of the ear, the superficial on the side temporal vessels and nerve are to be traced upwards ; and above the of 116 eat' zygomatic arch the branches of the facial which join an offset (10) of the superior maxillary nerve are to be sought. Behind the ear the posterior auricular vessels and nerve, and behind ear, below it branches from the great auricular nerve to the tip and back of the pinna are to be found ; one or more offsets of the last should be followed to the junction with the posterior auricular nerve. At the back of the head the ramifications of the occipital vessels, at the back and the large and small occipital nerves should be denuded ; the of lhe lieaJ" former nerve lies by the side of the artery, and the latter about midway between this vessel and the ear. Cotaneous Arteries. The arteries of the scalp (fig. 2) are vessels of furnished by the internal and external carotid trunks, and anasto-tl,e scalr' mose freely over the side of the head. Only two small branches, the supraorbital and frontal, come from the former; while three, viz., the temporal, occipital, and posterior auricular, are derived from the latter. The supraorbital artery (c) leaves the orbit through the notch Supraorbi- in the margin of the orbit, and is distributed on the forehead. Some ta 13' of its branches are superficial to the frontalis and supply the skin ; while others lie beneath the muscle, and supply it, the pericranium, and the bone. The frontal artery (b) is close to the inner angle of the orbit, Frontal and is much smaller than the preceding. It ends in branches for ni'tei'y- the supply of the muscles, integuments, and pericranium. The SUPERFICIAL TEMPORAL ARTERY (fZ) is One of the terminal Superficial branches of the external carotid. After crossing the zygortta j^poral immediately in front of the ear, the vessel divides on the temporal fascia into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch runs forwards with a serpentine course to anterior and the forehead, supplying muscular, cutaneous, and pericranial offsets, and anastomoses with the supraorbital artery ; this is the branch that is opened when blood is taken from the temporal artery.6 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. branches Poster^or branch is larger than the other, and ascends to the top of the head, over which it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. Its offsets are similar to those of the anterior division, and communicate behind with the occipital and posterior auricular arteries. artery*"1 Occipital artert (a). The terminal part of this artery, appear- ing between the trapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles, divides into large and tortuous branches, which spread over the back of the head. Communications take place with the artery of the opposite side, with the posterior part of the temporal, and with the following artery. Some offsets pass deeply to supply the occipitalis muscle, the pericranium, and the bone, ruricui'u- posterior auricclar artery (/) appears in front of the artery mastoid process, and divides into two branches. One (mastoid) is directed backwards to supply the occipitalis, and anastomose with the occipital artery. The other (auricular) supplies the retrahent muscle, the back of the pinna, and the superficial structures above the ear : offsets from this also pierce the pinna to be distributed on the opposite surface. Veins of the The veins of the exterior of the head generally correspond to the arteries in their course, and communicate freely together, as well as with the sinuses in the interior of the skull by means of small branches named emissary, and with the veins of the diploe of the cranial bones. The frontal vein is of large size, and descends to the inner end of the eyebrow, beneath which it is joined by the smaller supraorbital vein: the resulting vessel is known as the angular vein, and forms the commencement of the facial trunk. The temjooral vein descends to the temporo-maxillary trunk ; the posterior auricular vein to the external jugular; and the occipital veins join the deep veins of the back of the neck. Nerves of Cutaneous Nerves (fig. 2). The nerves of the scalp are fur- the scalp, noshed from cutaneous offsets of both cranial and spinal nerves. The half of the head in front of the ear receives branches from the three trunks of the fifth cranial nerve, and a few twigs from the facial nerve. The hinder part of the head is supplied by spinal nerves (anterior and posterior primary branches), except close behind the ear, where there is an offset of the facial or seventh cranial nerve. Supraorbital The supraorbital nerve (fig. 2,6) comes from the first trunk of nerve; ^ nerve) anci escapes from the orbit with its companion artery. It is placed at first beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum and frontalis muscles, and here gives offsets to these as well as to the pericranium. In the orbicidaris a communication is established between this and the facial nerve. Finally the nerve ends in two cutaneous branches, itstwoenia The inner of these soon pierces the frontalis, and reaches upwards neous ana as lligll ag t]ie parietai bone.

The TEMPORAL BRANCH OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE (second trunk of the fifth) is a slender twig (fig. 2, 10), which perforates the temporal aponeurosis about a finger's breadth above the zygomatic arch. When cutaneouVthe nerve is distributed on the fore part of the temple, and communicates with the facial nerve, also sometimes with the next. The auriculotemporal nerve (fig. 2, (/), a branch of the inferior maxillary (third trunk of the fifth), makes its appearance with the temporal artery in front of the ear. As soon as it emerges from beneath the parotid gland, it divides into two terminal branches. The posterior is the smaller of the two, and supplies the integument above the ear. The anterior branch ascends vertically to supply the skin as far as the upper limit of the temporal fossa. The nerve also furnishes an auricular branch (upper) to the fore part of the ear above the auditory meatus. The temporal branches of the facial nerve are directed up- wards over the zjrgomatic arch and the temporal aponeurosis to the orbicularis palpebrarum and frontalis muscles: they will be described with the dissection of the facial nerve. The posterior auricular nerve (fig. 2, 4) lies behind the ear with the artery of the same name. It arises from the facial nerve close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends in front of the mastoid process. Soon after the nerve becomes superficial it communicates with the great auricular nerve, and divides into occipital and auricular branches. The occipital branch is long and slender, and ends in the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle. It lies close to the bone, enveloped in dense fibrous structure. The auricular branch ascends to the back of the ear, supplying the retrahent muscle and the posterior surface of the pinna. The great auricular nerve of the cervical plexus (fig. 2, l) is seen to some extent at the lower part of the ear, but its anatomy will be afterwards given with the description of the cervical plexus. The great occipital (fig. 2, 3) is the largest cutaneous nerve at the back of the head, and is recognised by its proximity to the occipital artery. Springing from the posterior primary branch of the second cervical nerve, it perforates the muscles of the back of the neck, and divides on the occiput into numerous large offsets; these spread over the posterior part of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and terminate in the integument. As soon as the nerve pierces the trapezius, it is joined by an offset from the third cervical nerve ; and on the back of the head it communicates with the small occipital nerve. The small occipital nerve of the cervical plexus (fig. 2, s) lies midway between the ear and the preceding nerve, and is continued upwards in the integuments higher than the level of the ear. It communicates with the nerve on each side, viz., the posterior auricular and the great occipital. Usually this nerve furnishes an auricular branch to the upper part of the pinna on its cranial aspect.9 DUE A MATER. Section II. INTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Dissection. The skull is now to be opened, but before sawing Dissection the bone the dissector should detach, on the right side, the temporal *^ °gfn thG muscle nearly down to the zygoma, without separating the over- lying fascia; and all the remaining soft parts are to be divided by an incision carried around the skull, about one inch above the margin of the orbit at the forehead, and as low as the protuberance of the occipital bone behind. The cranium is to be sawn in the same line as the incision Precautions through the soft parts, but the saw is to cut only through the iSi^ugr^tne outer table of the bone. The inner table is to be broken through with bone, a chisel, in order that the subjacent membrane of the brain (dura mater) may not be injured. The skullcap is next to be forcibly detached by inserting the fingers between the cut surfaces in front, and the dura mater will then come into view. The dura mater is the most external of the membranes in- Dura mater, vesting the brain. It is a strong, fibrous structure, which serves as an internal periosteum to the bones, and supports the cerebral mass. Its outer surface is rough, and presents, now the bone is Appearance separated from it, numerous small fibrous and vascular processes ; °urface.r but these are most marked along the line of the sutures, where the attachment of the dura mater to the bone is more intimate. Kami- fying on the exposed part of the membrane are branches of the large meningeal vessels. Small granular masses, Pacchionian bodies, are also seen close to Pacchionian the middle line. The number of these bodies is very variable ;bodies- they are but seldom found before the third year, but generally after the seventh, and they increase with age. The surface of the skull is frequently indented by these bodies. Dissection. For the purpose of seeing the interior of the dura Cut through mater, divide this membrane with scissors close to the margin of dura mater- the skull, except in the middle bine before and behind, where the superior longitudinal sinus lies. The cut membrane is then to be raised on the right side towards the top of the head ; and the veins connecting it with the brain may be broken through. The inner surface of the dura mater is free and smooth, being inner separated from the arachnoid, the second of the coverings of the surfaee' brain, by the cavity known as the subdural space, although the two membranes are in the natural condition closely applied to one another. The fibrous tissue of which the dura mater is composed is and struc- so arranged as to give rise to two strata, an external which adheres ture' to the bones, and an internal wliich is lined by an epithelium similar to that on serous membranes. At certain spots these layers are slightly separated, and form thereby the spaces or sinuses for10 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD Processes. Falx. Form and attach- ments. Borders. Sinuses in it.

The falx cerebri (fig. 3) is the median sickle-shaped process of the dura mater, which dips in betM'een the hemispheres of the large brain. Its form and extent will be evident if the right half of the brain is gently separated from it. Narrow and pointed in front, where it is attached to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, it widens posteriorly, and joins a horizontal piece of the dura mater named the tentorium cerebelli. Its upper border is convex, and is fixed to the middle line of the skull as far backwards as the internal occipital protuberance ; and the lower or free border, concave, is turned towards the central portion of the brain (corpus callosuni), with which it is in contact posteriorly. In this fold of the dura mater are contained the following sinuses :—the superior longitudinal along the convex border, the inferior longitudinal in the hinder part of the lower edge, and the straight sinus at the line of junction between it and the tentorium. The superior longitudinal sinus (fig. 3, b) extends from the ethmoid bone to the internal occipital protuberance. Its position in the convex border of the falx will be made manifest by the escape of blood through numerous small veins, when pressure is made from before back with the finger along the middle line of the dura mater. When the sinus is opened it is seen to be narrow in front, and to widen behind, where it ends in a dilatation termed the torcular Herophili on one side (more frecpiently the right) of the internal occipital protuberance. Its cavity is triangular in form, with the apex of the space turned to the falx ; and across it are stretched small tendinous cords—chordas Willisii—near the openings of some of the cerebral veins. Occasionally small Pacchionian bodies pro- ject into the sinus. The sinus receives small veins from the substance of the skidl and dura mater, and larger ones from the brain; and the blood flows backwards in it. The cerebral veins open chiefly at the posterior part of the canal, and they lie for some distance against the wall of the sinus before they perforate the dura mater ; their course is directed from behind forwards, so that the current of the blood in them is evidently opposed to that in the sinus : this dis- position of the veins may be seen on the left side of the brain, where the parts are undisturbed. Directions. Before the rest of the dura mater can be examined, the brain must be taken from the head. To facilitate its removal, let the head incline backwards, while the shoulders are raised on a block, so that the brain may be separated somewhat from the base of the skull. For the division of the cranial nerves a sharp scalpel will be necessary ; and the nerves are to be cut longer on the one side than the other. Removal of the Brain. As a first step cut across the anterior part of the falx cerebri, and the different cerebral veins entering theREMOVAL OF THE BEAIN. 11 longitudinal sinus; raise and throw backwards the falx, but leave it uncut behind. Gently lift up the frontal lobes and the olfactory bulbs of the Lmre brain. Next cut through the internal carotid Anterior vssscls mid artery and the second and third nerves, which then appear, together nerves, with some veins descending from the brain ; the large second nerve is placed on the inner, and the round third nerve on the outer side of the artery. The brain is now to be supported in the left hand, and the pituitary body to be dislodged with the knife from the hollow in the centre of the sphenoid bone. A strong horizontal process of next the the dura mater (tentorium cerebelli) comes into view at the back tcnt' of the cranium. Along its free margin lies the small fourth nerve, which is to be cut at this stage of the proceeding. Make an incision through the tentorium on each side, close to its attachment to the temporal bone, without injuring the parts underneath : the following nerves, which will be then visible, are to be divided in succession. Near the inner margin of the tentorium is the fifth posterior nerve, consisting of a large and small root ; while nearer the nerves aiKl middle line of the skull is the slender sixth nerve. Below the fifth, and somewhat external to it, are the seventh and eighth nerves entering the internal auditory meatus, the former being anterior and the smaller of the two. Directly below the foregoing are the ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves in one line :—of these the upper small piece is the ninth or the glosso-pharyngeal; the flat band next below, the tenth or pneumo-gastric ; and the long round nerve ascending from the spinal canal, the eleventh or spinal acces- sory. The remaining nerve nearer the middle line is the twelfth, which consists of two small pieces. After dividing the nerves, cut through the vertebral arteries as vessels, and they wind round the medulla oblongata. Lastly, cut across the spinal cord as low as possible, as well as the roots of the spinal lastly, the nerves that are attached on each side. Then on placing the first spiual oord* two fingers of the right hand in the spinal canal, the cord may be raised, and the whole brain may be taken readily from the skull in the left hand. In doing this some large veins, passing from the hinder part of the cerebral hemisphere to the attached margin of the tentorium, will be broken through, as well as small ones from the portions of the brain in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull. Preservation of the brain. After removing some of the mem- How to pre- branes from the upper part, and making a few apertures through them on the under surface, the brain may be immersed in spirit to harden it. Wrap the brain up in a piece of calico, and then place it upside down in a suitable vessel, on the bottom of which some cotton-wool or tow has been spread, and let it be quite covered with spirit. Examination of (lie brain. At the end of two or three days the Bxamina- dissector should examine the other membranes and the vessels'. As Uon °f it- soon as the vessels have been learnt, the membranes are to be carefully removed from the surface of the brain, without detaching the different cranial nerves at the under surface. The brain may12 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. Directions. Dura mater in base of skull; its prolonga- tions, and connec- tions to bone.

The description of the brain and its vessels will be found after that of the head and neck. Directions. After setting aside the brain, the anatomy of the dura mater, and the vessels and nerves in the base of the skull should be proceeded with. For this purpose raise the head to a convenient height, and fasten the tentorium in its natural position with a few stitches. The dissector should be furnished with the base of a skull while studying the following parts. Dura mater. At the base of the cranium the dura mater is much more closely united to the bones than it is at the top of the skull. Here it follows the different inequalities of the osseous surfaces; and it sends processes through the several foramina, which join for the most part the pericranium, and furnish sheaths to the nerves. Beginning the examination in front, the membrane will be found to send a prolongation into the foramen caecum, as well as a series of tubes through the apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Through the sphenoidal fissure it joins the peri- osteum of the orbit ; and through the optic foramen a sheath is continued on the optic nerve to the eyeball. In the sella turcica the dura mater forms a recess which lodges the pituitary body, and behind the dorsum sella? it adheres closely to the basilar process of the occipital bone. From the latter part it may be traced into the spinal canal through the foramen magnum, to the margin of which it is very firmly united. The tentorium cerebelli is the process of the dura mater which is interposed in a somewhat horizontal position between the small brain (cerebellum) and the posterior part of the large brain (cere- brum). Its upper surface is raised along the middle, where it is joined by the falx cerebri, and is sloped laterally for the support of the back part of the cerebral hemispheres. Its under surface touches the small brain, and is joined by the falx cerebelli. The anterior concave margin is free, except at the ends where it is fixed by a narrow slip to each anterior clinoid process. The posterior or convex edge is connected to the following bones:— occipital (transverse groove), posterior inferior angle of the parietal, petrous portion of the temporal (upper border), and posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid. Along the centre of the tentorium is the straight sinus : and hi the attached edge are the lateral and superior petrosal sinuses on each side. The falx cerebelli has a corresponding position below the tentorium to the falx cerebri above that fold. It is much smaller than the falx of the cerebrum, and will appear on detaching the tentorium. Triangular in form, this fold is adherent to the internal occipital crest, and projects between the henuspheres of the small brain. Its13 VENOUS SINUSES OF CRANIUM. base is directed to the tentorium ; and the apex reaches the foramen magnum, on each side of which it gives a small slip. In it is contained the occipital sinus. The Sinuses are channels for venous blood between the layers of the dura mater. They are arranged in two groups, the one com- prising the sinuses that converge towards the internal occipital protuberance, while the other is formed by the cavernous sinuses on the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone and the canals opening into these. A. The superior longitudinal sinus has been described at p. 10. The inferior longitudinal sinus (fig. 3, c) resembles a small vein, and is contained in the lower border of the falx cerebri at the contains occipital sinus. Sinuses of the skull. Superior and inferior lon- gitudinal. Fig. 3.1 posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and- the large brain, and ends in the straight sinus (d) at the edge of the tentorium. The straight sinus (fig. 3, d) lies along the junction of the falx straight with the tentorium, extending from the termination of the preceding sinus to the internal occipital protuberance, where it is continued into one of the lateral sinuses, generally the left. Its form is triangular, like the superior longitudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of the large brain, and some small veins from the upper surface of the cerebellum. The occipital sinus (fig. 3T g) is a small canal in the falx cere- occipital belli, which reaches from the torcular Herophili to the foramen smus- magnum, and collects the blood from the occipital fossaa. This sinus may be double. The lateral sinuses, right and left, are the channels by which Lateral most of the blood passes from the skull.

Cavernous sinus lias nerves in outer wall; contains carotid artery and sixth nerve tributaries and com- munica- tions. occipital protuberance, along the winding groove on the occipital, parietal and temporal bones, to the jugular foramen, where it ends in the internal jugular vein. The sinus of the right side is generally larger than the left, and begins at the torcular Herophili (p. 10), forming the continuation of the superior longitudinal sinus. The left lateral sinus is mainly prolonged from the ending of the straight sinus, but it is also joined by a branch from the lower end of the superior longitudinal sinus, which crosses obliquely in front of the occipital protuberance. .In some cases this arrangement is reversed, so that the torcular Herophili and the larger lateral sinus are placed on the left side ; and occasionally the torcular Herophili forms a common place of meeting (confluence) of the superior longitudinal, the straight ami the tAvo lateral sinuses. The lateral sinus is joined by some cerebral and cerebellar veins, and, opposite the upper edge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, by the superior petrosal sinus. It communicates with the occipital veins through the mastoid foramen, and often with the deep veins of the neck through the posterior condylar foramen. The jugular foramen is divided into three compartments by fibrous bands. Through the posterior opening the lateral sinus passes ; through the anterior the inferior petrosal sinus; and through the central one the ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves. Dissection. To examine the cavernous sinus on the left side, cut through the dura mater by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone from the anterior to the posterior clinoid process, and internal to the position of the third nerve; behind the clinoid process, let the knife be directed inwards for about half the width of the basilar part of the occipital bone. By placing the handle of the scalpel in the opening thus made, the extent of the space will be defined. A probe or a blow-pipe will be required, in order that it may be passed into the different sinuses joining the cavernous centre. B. The cavernous sinus, which has been so named from the reticulate structure in its interior, is situate on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. This space, resulting from the separation of the two layers of the dura mater, is of an irregular shape, and extends from the sphenoidal fissure to the tip of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The layer of dura mater bounding the sinus externally is of some thickness, and contains in its substance the third and fourth nerves, with the ophthalmic trunk of the fifth nerve; these lie in their numerical order from above clown. The cavity of the sinus is larger behind than before, and is traversed by a network of slender fibrous cords. Through the space winds the trunk of the internal carotid artery surrounded by the sympathetic, with the sixth nerve on the outer side of the vessel; but all these are separated from the blood in the space by a thin lining membrane. The cavernous sinus receives the ophthalmic veins from the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and some inferior cerebral veins. It communicates with its fellow of the opposite side by the inter--f \ MENINGEAL AKTERIES. 15 cavernous sinuses, and with the pterygoid plexus outside the skull through the foramen ovale and the foramen lacerum. The blood leaves the cavity by the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The intercavernous sinuses are two vessels which pass trans- iutereavern- versely in the sella turcica between the right and left cavernous circular sinuses, being placed one in front of, and the other behind the sinus- pituitary body. To the venous ring thus formed around the pituitary body the name of circular sinus has been given. The superior petrosal sinus (fig. 3, f) lies in a groove in the Superior upper edge of the petrous part of the temporal bone, and extends 11etlosal- between the cavernous and lateral sinuses. Small veins from the cerebellum are received into it. The inferior petrosal sinus (fig. 3, h) is larger than the superior, inferior and lies in a groove along the line of junction of the petrous part pe osaL of the temporal with the basilar process of the occipital bone ; it is joined by small veins from the cerebellum, and one from the internal ear. This sinus passes through the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, and ends in the internal jugular vein. The transverse sinus or basilar plexus is a venous network Transverse in the substance of the dura mater over the basilar process of the g[nJ^, occipital bone, uniting the inferior petrosal sinuses. Meningeal Arteries. These arteries supplying the cranium Arteries of and the dura mater come through the base of the skull; they have ^l™_^latcr been named from their situation in the three fossas, anterior, middle, and posterior meningeal. The anterior meningeal are small branches of the anterior interior ethmoidal artery (p. 46), which enters the skull by the anterior meninseal- internal orbital canal: they are distributed to the dura mater over and near the ethmoid bone. The middle meningeal arteries are three in number: Middle two, named large and small, are derived from the internal maxillary memnseal- trunk ; and the third is an offset of the ascending pharyngeal artery. a. The large meningeal branch of the internal maxillary artery Large from appears through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone, and "Jaxniary divides into two principal branches. The larger of these enters the deep groove on the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and ends in ramifications which extend upwards to the top of the head and forwards over the frontal bone. The posterior branch is dis- tributed over the hinder part of the parietal and the upper part of the occipital bones. Two veins accompany this artery. As soon as the artery comes into the cranial cavity, it furnishes Rives launches to the dura mater and to the ganglion of the fifth nerve, duramater One small offset, petrosal, enters the hiatus Fallopii, and supplies the surrounding bone (Hyrtl). One or two branches pass through and bone, the sphenoidal fissure into the orbit, and anastomose with the ophthalmic artery. b. The small meningeal branch is an offset of the large one Small outside the skull, and is transmitted through the foramen ovale to muni,,ecal- the memjb^aae lining the middle cranial fossa. c. Another meningeal branch from the ascending pharyngeal One fromDISSECTION OF THE HEAD 1G ascending pharyngeal. Posterior meningeal. Nerves of dnra mater.

Third'nerve. artery comes througli the foramen lacerum (basis cranii). This is seldom injected, and is not often visible. The posterior meningeal arteries are small twigs of the ascend- ing pharyngeal which enter the skull by the anterior condylar and jugular foramina, and supply the dura mater in the neighbourhood, and a branch of the vertebral artery which is distributed over the lower part of the occipital bone. The branch coming through the jugular foramen is sometimes derived from the occipital artery. Meningeal Nerves. Offsets to the dura mater are said to be derived from the fourth, fifth, ninth and tenth cranial nerves; and from the sympathetic nerve. Cranial Nerves (fig. 4). As the cranial nerves pass through their apertures in the base of the skull they are invested by processes of the membranes of the brain, which are thus disposed : —those of the dura mater and pia mater are continued into the sheath of the nerve ; while that of the arachnoid, except in the case of the second nerve, terminates as the nerve enters the dura mater. Some of the nerves, those in the middle fossa of the skull for instance, receive sheaths of the dura mater before they reach the foramina of transmission. The nerves are arranged in twelve pairs, which are enumerated from before backwards in the order in which they perforate the dura mater. Only pirrt of the intracranial course of each nerve will be seen at this stage, the rest will be learnt in the dissection of the base of the brain. The first or olfactory nerves are about twenty small filaments which arise from the olfactory bulb of the brain (fig. 33) as it lies in the groove at the side of the crista galli, and descend to the nose through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The second or optic nerve (fig. 4, 2), diverging to the eyeball from its commissure, enters the orbit through the optic foramen : accompanying the nerve is the ophthalmic artery. Dissection. The third and fourth nerves, and the ophthalmic trunk of the fifth nerve, lie in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus ; and to see them, it will be necessary to trace them through the dura mater towards the orbit. Afterwards the student should follow outwards the roots of the fifth nerve into the middle fossa of the skull, as in fig. 4, taking away the dura mater from them, and from the surface of the large Gasserian ganglion which lies on the fore part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. "From the front of the ganglion arise two other large trunks besides the ophthalmic, viz., superior and inferior maxillary, and these should also be traced to their apertures of exit from the skull. If the dura mater is removed entirely from the bone near the nerves a better view will be obtained. The third or oculomotor nerve (fig. 4, 3) is destined for the muscles of the orbit. It enters the wall of the cavernous sinus uear the anterior clinoid process, and is placed at first above the other nerves ; but when it is about to enter the orbit through theNERVES IN BASE OF SKULL. 17 sphenoidal fissure, it sinks below the fourth and a part of the fifth, and divides into two branohes. Near the orbit the nerve is joined by one or two delicate fila- pass™ to ments from the cavernous plexus (p. 20). The fourth or trochlear nerve (fig. 4,4) courses forwards to one Fourth muscle in the orbit. It is the smallest of the cranial nerves, and ncrvy Fig. 4.* pierces the dura mater at the free edge of the tentorium, close behind the posterior clinoid process. In the wall of the sinus it in the wall lies below the third; but as it is about to pass through the 0 smus- sphenoidal fissure it rises higher than all the other nerves. While in the wall of the sinus the fourth nerve is joined by twigs of the sympathetic ; and it is sometimes connected with the ophthalmic trunk of the fifth. Fifth or trifacial nerve (fig. 4, 5). This nerve is distributed Fifth nerve to the face and head, and consists of two parts or roots—a large or roots!™ sensory, and a small or motor.

Seventh and eighth nerves leave skull to- gether. dura mater into the middle fossa of the hase of the skull, where it immediately enters the Gasserian ganglion. The Gasserian ganglion, placed in a depression close to the point of the petrous part of the temporal Lone, is flattened, and about half an inch wide. The upper surface of the ganglion is closely united to the dura mater, and presents a semdunar elevation, the convexity of which looks forwards. Some filaments from the plexus of the sympathetic on the carotid artery join its inner side. Branches. From the front of the ganglion proceed the three following trunks :—The ophthalmic nerve, the first and highest, is destined for the orbit and forehead. Next in order is the superior maxillary nerve, which leaves the skull by the foramen rotundum, and ends in the face below the orbit. And the last, or the inferior maxillary nerve, passes through the foramen ovale to reach the lower jaw, the lower part of the face, and the tongue. The small root, lying in the same tube of the dura mater as the large one, passes beneath the ganglion without communicating with it, and joins only one of the three trunks derived from the ganglion : if the ganglion be raised, this root will be seen to enter the inferior maxillary nerve. Those branches of the ganglion which are unconnected with the .small or motor root, viz., the ophthalmic and superior maxillary, are solely nerves of sensibility ; but the inferior maxillary, which is compounded of both roots, is a nerve of sensibility and motion. It will moreover be subsequently seen that the fibres of the motor root are almost entirely confined to the part of the inferior maxillary nerve supplying the muscles of the lower jaw, and that the larger branches of the nerve are wholly sensory in function. The ophthalmic nerve is the only one of the three trunks which needs a more special notice in this stage of the dissection. It is continued through the sphenoidal fissure and the orbit to the fore- head. In form it is a flat band, and is contained in the wall of the cavernous sinus below the third and fourth nerves. Near the orbit it divides into three branches (p. 40). In this situation it is joined by filaments of the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, and gives a small recurrent filament (fig. 4,f) to the tentorium cerebelli. The sixth or abducent nerve (fig. 4, 6) enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and supplies one of the orbital muscles. It pierces the dura mater behind the body of the sphenoid bone, and crosses the space of the cavernous sinus, instead of lying in the outer wall with the other nerves. In the sinus the nerve is placed close against the outer side of the carotid artery; and it is joined by one or two large branches of the sympathetic nerve surrounding that vessel. The seventh or facial and the eighth or auditory nerves (fig. 4,7) pass together into the internal auditory meatus, the facial being the smaller and higher of the two. At the bottom of the meatus they separate; the facial nerve courses through the aqueduct of Fallopius to the face, and the auditory nerve is distributed to the internal ear.19 INTERNAL CAEOTID ARTERY. The NINTH Or GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL, the TENTH, PNEUMO-GASTRIC Ninth, or VAGUS, and the ELEVENTH or SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVES (fig. 4, 8) eleventh*1 pass through the middle compartment of the jugular foramen. The {^ou^-h aS* glosso-pharyngeal is external to the other two, and has a distinct jugular opening in the dura mater. The spinal accessory nerve ascends foramen- through the foramen magnum and, together with the vagus, enters an aperture in the dura mater close to the occipital bone. The TWELFTH or HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE (fig. 4, 9) is the motor Twelfth nerve of the tongue, and consists of two small pieces, which pierce neive- the dura mater separately opposite the anterior condylar foramen ; these unite at the outer part of that aperture. Dissection. The dissector may now return to the examination of Dissection the trunk of the carotid artery as it winds through the cavernous 0 carotld- sinus. On the opposite side of the head, on which the nerves in the ofsympa- wall of the cavernous sinus are untouched, an attempt may be made uses'? plex" to find two small plexuses of the sympathetic on the carotid artery, though in an injected body this dissection is scarcely possible. One of these (cavernous) is near the root of the anterior clinoid cavernous, process ; and to bring it into view it will be necessary to cut off that piece of bone, and to dissect out with care the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth nerves, looking for filaments between them and the plexus. Another plexus (carotid), joining the fifth and sixth and carotid, nerves, surrounds the artery as it enters the sinus. The internal carotid artery appears in the cranium at the J11^'™1 apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone. In this part of its artery course the vessel lies between the layers of the dura mater bound- ing the cavernous sinus along the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, and makes two bends so as to have the form of the letter S reclined. It first ascends in the inner part of the foramen lacerum, winds and then runs forwards to the root of the anterior clinoid process ; cavernous finally it turns upwards in the groove on the inner side of this pro-sinus- cess, perforates the dura mater forming the roof of the sinus, and divides into cerebral arteries at the base of the brain. In this course the artery is enveloped by nerves derived from the sympa- thetic in the neck (p. 114). The branches of the artery here are few. In the sinus there are Branches, some small arteries (arterise receptaculi) for the supply of the dura mater and the bone, the nerves, and, the pituitary body ; and oppo- site the anterior clinoid process the ophthalmic branch arises. The terminal branches of the carotid will be seen in the dissec- tion of the base of the brain (p. 184). Sympathetic Nerve. Accompanying the carotid arteiy is a pro- Sympathetic iongation of the sympathetic nerve of the neck, which 'forms the forms following plexuses :— The carotid plexus is situate on the outer side of the vessel, at ™rotM its entrance into the cavernous sinus, and communicates with the P 6XUS' sixth nerve and the Gasserian ganglion.

Filaments from the plexus unite with the third, fourth, and ophthalmic nerves. One filament is also famished to the lenticular ganglion in the orbit, either sepa- rately from, or in conjunction with the nasal nerve. After forming these plexuses, the nerves surround the trunk of the carotid, and are continued on the cerebral and ophthalmic branches of that vessel: one offset enters the eyeball with the central artery of the retina. Petrosal nerves. Beneath the Gasserian ganglion is the large superficial petrosal nerve (fig. 35, 2) entering the hiatus Fallopii to join the facial nerve. External to this is sometimes seen the small superficial petrosal nerve (fig. 35, 3), but this is frequently concealed in the substance of the temporal bone. The source, and the destination of these small nerves will be afterwards learnt. It will sitffice now for the student to notice their position, and to see that they are kept moist and fit for examination at a future time. Directions. Now that the study of the base of the skull has been completed a preservative fluid or salt should be applied, and the flaps of skin should be stitched together over all. Section III. DISSECTION OF THE FACE. Directions. Position of head. Dissection. How tn raise the skin from muscle of eyelids, from the race, Directions. The muscles and vessels are to be dissected together on the left side of the face, and the right side is to be kept for the nerves. Position. The head is to be lowered from the position in which it was placed for the examination of the base of the skull, and turned so that the side of the face to be dissected is upwards : fix it in this position with hooks. Dissection. As a preparatory step, the muscular fibres of the apertures may be made slightly tense by inserting a small quantity of tow or cotton wool between the eyelids and the eyeball, and between the lips and the teeth. First lay bare the sphincter muscle of the eyelids by making a skin-deep incision over the margin of the orbit, and raising the skin of the lids towards the aperture of the eye. Much care must be taken in detaching the skin from the thin and pale fibres of the orbicular muscle in the lids, else they will be cut away in conse- quence of the little areolar tissue between the two. Next the integument is to be removed from the side of the face by one incision in front of the ear from above the zygomatic arch to the angle of the jaw, and another along the base of the jaw to the chin : a cut should also be made along the free margin of each lip from the centre to the angle of the mouth, and another roundMUSCLES OF THE NOSE. 21 the edge of the nostril. The flap of skin is to be raised from behind forwards, and left adherent along the middle line. On the side of the nose the skin is closely united to the subjacent a»d from parts, and must be detached with caution. Around the mouth is aido of nose the orbicular muscle of the lips, and from this many fleshy slips extend both upwards and downwards, but they are all marked so t0 ciea„ distinctly as to escape injury, with the exception of the small "J"^* risorius muscle which goes from the corner of the mouth towards mouth, the ramus of the lower jaw. While removing the fat from the muscles, each fleshy slip may be tightened with hooks. The facial vessels aud their branches will come into view as Facial the muscles are cleaned; but the nerves may be disregarded on this vessols> side. In front of the ear is the parotid gland, the duct of which is to and parotid be preserved ; this is on a level with the meatus auditorius, and aland, pierces the middle of the cheek. Muscles of the Face (fig. 6). The superficial muscles of the iu the face face are disposed in three groups : one of the nose, another of the fo^^rcc eyelids and eyebrow, and a third of the aperture of the mouth. One groups, of the muscles of mastication, viz., the masseter, is partly displayed at the hinder part of the face, covering the ramus of the lower jaw. Muscles of the Nose (fig. 5). These muscles are the following : Muscles of pyramidalis nasi, compressor naris, levator labii superioris alaeque uose- nasi, dilatator naris, and depressor alas nasi. The pyramidalis nasi (fig. 5,l) is a small fleshy slip that covers Pyramidalis the nasal bone, and appears to be a continuation of the innermost nasi" part of the frontalis muscle. Its fibres are attached above to the skin of the forehead ; below, they end in the aponeurosis of the compressor muscles over the cartilaginous part of the nose. Its inner border meets the muscle of the opposite side. Action. This muscle draws down the skin of the centre of the Use. forehead, and produces transverse wrinkles at the root of the nose. Compressor naris. This muscle (rig. 5,3) is not well seen till Compressor after the examination of the following one, by which it is partly nom concealed. Triangular in shape, it arises by its apex from the upper maxillary bone near the anterior nasal aperture.

In the dense tissue on the outer side of the nostril arc a few muscular fibres, both at the fore and back part of that aperture (fig. 5, 4 and '"'), to which the above name has been given by Theile : they are seldom visible without a lens. The anterior slip (4) passes from the cartilage of the aperture to the integument of the margin of the nostril; and the posterior (5) arising from the upper jawbone and the small sesamoid cartilages, ends also in the integuments of the nostril. Action. The fibres enlarge the nasal opening by raising and everting the outer- edge. The DEPRESSOR ALM NASI (fig. 5, G) will be seen if the upper bp is everted, and the mucous membrane is removed by the side of the framum of the lip. It arises below the nose from the incisor fossa of the superior maxilla, and ascends to be inserted, into the septum narium and the posterior part of the ala of the nose. Action. By drawing down and turning in the edge of the dilated nostril, it restores the aperture to its usual size. Muscles op the Eyelids. The muscles of the eyelids and eye- brow are lour in number, viz., orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, levator palpebral superioris, and tensor tarsi t: the two latter are dissected in the orbit, and will be described with it. The orbicularis palpebrarum (fig. 6,2) is the sphincter muscle closing the opening between the eyelids. It is a flat and thin layer, which extends from the margin of the lids beyond the circumfer- ence of the orbit. From a difference in the characters of the fibres, a division has been made of them into two parts—outer and inner. The external fibres (orbital part), the best marked, are fixed only at the inner side of the orbit. This attachment (origin) is connected with the borders of the internal tarsal ligament; above the ligament with the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and the internal angular process of the frontal bone ; and below the ligament with the orbital margin of the superior maxillary bone. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, giving rise to ovals, which lie side by side, and increase in size towards the outer edge of the muscle, where they project beyond the margin of the orbit. Some of the peripheral fibres spread upwards to the skin of the forehead, and others downwards to that of the check'. * Muscles of the nose. 1. Pyramidalis nasi. 2.

Close to the cilia or eyelashes the fibres form Ciliary a small pale bundle, which is sometimes called ciliary. The muscle is subcutaneous; and its circumference is blended Relations, above with the frontalis. Beneath the upper half of the orbicularis, as it lies on the margin of the orbit, is the corrugator supercilii muscle with the supraorbital vessels and nerve ; and beneath the lower half is part of the elevator of the upper lip. The outer fibres are joined occasionally by slips to other contiguous muscles below the orbit. Action. The inner fibres cause the lids to approach each other, Use of inner shutting the eye; and in forced contraction the outer commissure is ail(i drawn inwards. In closing the eye the lids move unequally—the upper being much depressed, and the lower slightly elevated and moved horizontally inwards. When the outer fibres contract, the eyebrow is depressed, and the outer libies. skin over the edge of the orbit is raised around the eye, so as to protect the ball. Elevation of the upper lip accompanies contrac- tion of the outer part of the orbicularis, owing to the associated action of the levator labii superioris and zygomatic muscles. The corrugator supercilii is beneath the orbicularis, near the Corrugator inner angle of the orbit. Its fibres arise from the inner part of the suPerciln superciliary ridge of the frontal bone, and are directed outwards between the bundles of the orbicularis to be inserted into the skin inserted into above the inner half of the eyebrow. It is a short muscle, and is skin- distinguished by the closeness of its fibres. Action.

The muscles of the aperture of the Muscles of mouth consist of a sphincter; an elevator of the upper lip and angle the mouth' of the mouth ; an elevator and depressor of the lower lip and angle of the mouth ; and retractors of the corner. Lastly, a wide muscle of the cheek closes the space between the jaws. The orbicularis oris muscle (fig. 6, ") surrounds the opening Sphincter of of the mouth, and is united with the several muscles converging to the mouth that aperture. It consists of two parts, inner and outer, which consists of differ in the appearance and arrangement of the fibres, like the tw0 parts: sphincter muscle of the eyelids. The inner part, the fibres of which are pale in colour and fine inner or in texture, forms a rounded thick fasciculus, which corresponds labia1' with the red margin of the lip.

The levator labii sdpekioris (fig. 6,G) extends vertically from Elevator of the lower margin of the orbit to the orbicularis oris. It arises from uPPerllP- the upper maxillary and malar bones above the infraorbital fora- men, and blends inferiorly with the orbicularis oris. Near the orbit the muscle is overlapped by the orbicularis palpebrarum, but below that spot it is subcutaneous. By its inner side it joins the common Relations, elevator of the ala of the nose and upper lip ; and to its outer side he the zygomatic muscles, the small one joining it. Beneath it are the infraorbital vessels and nerve. Action. By the action of this muscle the upper lip is raised, and Use. the skin of the cheek is bulged below the eye. The DEPRESSOR LABII INFERIORIS (fig. 6, 12) is opposite the Depressor of elevator of the upper Up, and has much yellow fat mixed with its lower hp- fibres. The muscle has a wide origin from a depression on the front of the lower jaw, reaching outwards from near the symphysis to a little beyond the mental foramen ; ascending thence it is united with the orbicularis in the lower lip. Its inner border joins in the lip the muscle of the opposite side; and its outer is overlapped by the depressor anguli oris. Action. If one muscle contracts, the half of the lip of the same Use. side is depressed and everted; but by the use of both muscles, the whole hp is lowered and turned outwards, and rendered tense at the centre. The levator menti (levator labii inferioris) is a small muscle e evator of on the side of the frcenum of the lower lip, which is opposite the clun- depressor of the ala of the nose in the upper lip. When the lip has been everted and the mucous membrane removed, the muscle will be seen to arise from the incisor fossa of the lower jaw, and to descend to its insertion into the integument of the chin.

Buccinator muscle. Origin. Insertion at corner of the mouth. Parts in con- tact with it. Use on aperture, on cheek, iu expelling air. Action. The angle of the month is drawn downwards and back- wards by it, as is exemplified in a sorrowful countenance. The zygomatic muscles (fig. 6, 7 and 8) are directed obliquely from the malar hone towards the angle of the mouth and the upper lip. One is longer and larger than the other; they are therefore named major and minor. The zygomaticus major (8) arises from the outer part of the malar bone, and is inserted into the angle of the mouth. The zygomaticus minor (7) is attached to the malar bone in front of the other, and blends with the fibres of the special elevator of the upper Up. Action. The large muscle draws upwards and backwards the corner of the mouth, as in laughing ; and the small one assists the levator labii superioris in raising the upper lip. The risorius muscle (Santorini) (fig. 6, ,J) is a thin and narrow bundle of fibres, sometimes divided into two or more parts, which arises externally from the fascia over the masseter muscle, and is connected internally with the apex of the depressor anguli oris. Action. The use of this muscle is indicated by its name, as it retracts the corner of the mouth in smiling. The buccinator (fig. 6, u) is the flat and thin muscle of the cheek, and occupies the interval between the jaws. The muscle arises from the outer surface of the alveolar borders of the upper and lower maxillae, as far forwards in each as the first molar tooth ; and in the interval between the jaws behind it is attached to a tendinous band known as the pterygo-maxillary ligament. From this origin the fibres are directed forwards to the angle of the mouth, where they mix with the other muscles and with both parts of the orbicu- laris ; and as some of the central fibres descend to the lower lip while others ascend to the upper lip, a decussation takes place at the corner of the mouth. On the cutaneous surface of the buccinator are the different muscles converging to the angle of the mouth ; and crossing the upper part is the duct of the parotid gland, which perforates the muscle opposite the second upper molar tooth. Internally the muscle is lined by the mucous membrane of the mouth, and ex- ternally it is covered by a fascia (bucco-pharyngeal) that is con- tinued to the pharynx. By its intermaxillary origin the buccinator corresponds with the attachment of the superior constrictor of the pharynx. Action. By one muscle the corner of the mouth is retracted, and by the action of both the aperture of the mouth is widened trans- versely. In mastication the cheek is pressed by the muscular contraction against the dental arches, while the corner of the mouth is fixed by the orbicularis. In the expulsion of air from the mouth, as in whistling, the muscle is'contracted so as to prevent bulging of the cheek ; but in the use of a blow-pipe it is distended over the volume of air contained in the mouth, and drives out a continuous stream by its contraction.VESSELS OE THE FACE. 27 The principal Vessels op the Face (fig. 18) are the facial and Arteries of transverse facial arteries with their accompanying veins. The the faoe- arteries are hranches of the external carotid ; and the facial vein is received into the internal jugular trunk. The facial artery (fig. 18, </), a branch of the carotid, emerges Facial from the neck, and crosses the base of the lower jaw immediately in !irt(;|'y ; front of the masseter muscle. From this point the artery ascends in a tortuous maimer, near the angle of the mouth and the side of the nose, to the inner margin of the orbit, where it anastomoses with the ophthalmic artery. The course of the vessel is comparatively course superficial in the mass of fat of the inner part of the cheek. At first it is concealed by the platysma while crossing the jaw, but an(1 rel.,. this thin muscle does not prevent pulsation being recognised during tions- life; and near the mouth the large zygomatic muscle is superficial to it. The vessel rests successively on the lower jaw, buccinator muscle, elevator of the angle of the mouth, and elevator of the upper lip. Accompanying the artery is the facial vein, which takes nearly a straight course, and lies to its outer side. Brandies. From the outer side of the vessel unnamed branches Plan of tin- are furnished to the muscles and integuments, some of which anas- "ranches- tomose with the transverse facial artery. From the inner side are given the following branches :— The inferior labial branch (t) runs inwards beneath the depressor inferior anguli oris muscle, and is distributed between the lower bp and lat,ial- chin ; it communicates with the inferior coronary, and with the mental branch of the inferior dental artery. Coronary branches (r and s).

From the arterial arches thus formed offsets are supplied to the lips and labial glands. From the arch in the upper bp a branch is given to each side of the septum Branch to narium,—artery of Hie septum. .septum. The lateral nasal branch (p) arises opposite the ala nasi, and Lateral passes beneath the levator labii superioris alaxjue nasi to the side of j^J,,, the nose, where it anastomoses with the nasal branch of the oph- thalmic artery. The angular branch (o) is the terminal twig of the facial artery at Angular the inner angle of the orbit, and joins the nasal branch of the oph-1;ranch- thalmic artery. The facial vein commences at the root of the nose in a vein named Facial vein angular (p. 6). It then crosses over the elevator of the upper lip, and, separating from the artery, courses beneath the large zygomatic away nun. muscle to the side of the jaw. Afterwards it has a short course in artcry: the neck to join the internal jugular vein. Brandies. At the mner side of the orbit the angular vein receives joined by veins from the upper eyelid (superior palpebral) and from the side l,ra,,oh(,;- of the nose. Below the orbit the facial trunk is joined by veins from the lower eyelid (inferior palpebral), as well as by a largeDISSECTION OE THE FACE. branch, anterior internal maxillary or deep facial vein, that comes from the plexus in the pterygoid region (p. 89) ; and thence to its termination by veins corresponding with the branches of the artery in the face and neck. The transverse FACIAL artery (fig. 18) is a branch of the super- ficial temporal, and appears in the face at the anterior border of the parotid gland. It lies by the side of the parotid duct, with branches of the facial nerve, and distributes offsets to the muscles and in- teguments ; some branches anastomose with the facial artery. Dissection. The parotid gland in front of the ear may be next displayed. To see the gland, raise the skin from the surface towards the ear by means of a cut from the base of the jaw to the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; this cut may be united with that made for the dissection of the posterior muscle of the ear. A strong fascia covers the gland, and is connected above and behind to the zygomatic arch and the cartilage of the ear, but is continued in front over the face ; this is to be removed, so that the gland may be detached slightly from the parts around. The great auri- cular nerve will be seen ascending to the lobule of the ear; and three or four small lymphatic glands rest on the surface of the parotid. The parotid (fig. 16,10) is the largest of the salivary glands. It occupies the space between the ear and the lower jaw, and is named from its position. Its excretory duct enters the mouth through the middle of the cheek. The shape of the gland is irregular, and is determined by the surrounding parts. Thus inferiorly, where there is not any resisting structure, the parotid projects into the neck, and comes into close proximity with the submaxillary gland, though separated from it by a process of the cervical fascia ; a line from the angle of the jaw to the sterno-mastoid muscle marks usually the extent of the gland in this direction. Above, the parotid is limited by the zygomatic arch and the temporal bone. Along the posterior part the sterno- mastoid muscle extends ; but anteriorly, the gland projects some- what into the face over the masseter muscle, and has connected with it in this situation a small accessory part, known as the soda parotid/is. Issuing from the anterior border is the excretory duct—dud of Stenson (ductus Stenonis, fig. 17), which crosses the masseter below the socia parotidis, and perforates the buccinator and the mucous membrane of the cheek obliquely opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The duct lies between the transverse facial artery and some branches of the facial nerve, the latter being below it. A line drawn from the meatus auditorius to a little below the nostril would mark the level of the duct in the face ; and the central point of the line would be opposite the opening into the mouth. The length of the duct is about two inches and a half ; and its capacity is large enough to allow a small probe to pass, but the opening into the mouth is much less. The cutaneous surface of the parotid is smooth, and three or fourPAROTID GLAND. 29 lymphatic glands are seated on it; but from the deep part processes are sent into the inequalities of the space between the jaw and the mastoid process. Dissection. By removing with caution the parotid gland, the ^issseeec^1 hollows that it fills will come into view : at the same time the dis- parts, sector will see the vessels and nerves that pass through it. An ex- amination of the processes of the gland, and of the number of important vessels and nerves in relation with it, will demonstrate the dangers attending any operation on it. The duct may be opened, and a pin may be passed along it to the mouth, to show the position and the diminished size of the aperture. Two large processes of the gland extend deeply into the neck. Deep part One dips behind the styloid process, and projects beneath the ?'nvksbehmd mastoid process and sterno-mastoid muscle, where it reaches also the deep vessels and nerves of the neck. The other piece is situate in front of the styloid process ; it passes into the glenoid hollow behind the articulation of the lower jaw, and sinks beneath the ramus of that bone along the internal maxillary artery. Coursing through the middle of the gland is the external carotid Vessels and artery, which ascends behind the ramus of the jaw, and furnishes the posterior auricular, superficial temporal, and internal maxillary branches. Superficially to the artery lies the trunk formed by the junction of the temporal and internal maxillary veins ; and this common trunk, receiving some veins from the parotid, divides near the angle of the jaw into two branches, the anterior of which passes downwards to join the facial vein, while the posterior inclines back- wards over the border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and is continued into the external jugular vein (fig. 15). Crossing the vessels in nerves in ? . the eland the gland from behind forwards is the trunk of the facial nerve, which divides here into its primary branches. The superficial temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve lies above the upper part of the glandular mass ; and offsets of the great auricular nerve pierce the gland at the lower part, and join the facial. In dissecting out the gland it has been seen to consist of a Obvious number of lobules separated by connective tissue septa. From the g^ud!1"* °f lobules small ducts arise, and these join together so as to give rise to two large tubes, which are placed superficially to the branches of the facial nerve in the gland, and by their union opposite the hinder margin of the ramus of the jaw form the beginning of Stenson's duct. As it crosses the masseter the main duct receives one or more small branches from the socia parotidis. The parotid receives its arteries from the external carotid ; and Vessels and its nerves from the sympathetic, auriculotemporal of the fifth, nerves facial, and great auricular. Its lymphatics join those of the neck. Two or three small molar glands lie on the surface of the Molar buccinator, and open into the mouth near the last molar teeth by glands- separate ducts.

The lower and posterior part of each lateral surface is convex and marked off by a curved groove, constituting the ala. The base presents the oval apertures of the nostrils or anterior nares, separated by a short thick partition, the scptwm narivm or columna nasi. The shape of the nose is maintained by a framework consisting of the nasal bones and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones above, and of the cartilages of the nose below, in the part corresponding to the anterior nasal aperture of the skull. Cartilages of the Nose (fig. 7). These are five in number, one in the centre, the cartilage of the septum, and two on each side, the lateral cartilage and the cartilage of the aperture. They are all hyaline cartilage, but do not show any tendency to become ossified. Only the lateral cartilages are learnt in this stage of the dissection. Dissection. The lateral cartilages will be seen when the muscular and fibrous structures of the left side of the nose, have been taken away. By l nming aside the lateral cartilages the septal one will appear in the middle line. The lateral cartilage (upper lat. cart., fig. 7, 2) is flattened, and triangular in form. Posteriorly it is attached to the nasal and upper maxillary bones; and anteriorly it joins the cartilage of the septum above, but is separated from it by a narrow cleft below. Inferiorly, the lateral cartilage is con- tiguous to the cartilage of the aperture, and is connected to it by fibrous tissue. The cartilage of the aperture (lower lat. cart., fig. 7) forms a ring around the opening of the nose except behind. It has not any attachment directly to bone ; but it is united above to the lateral cartilage by fibrous tissue, and below with the dense teguments forming the ala of the nose and the margin of the nostril. The part of the cartilage (3) which bounds the opening externally is narrow and pointed behind, where it forms two or three vertical folds, and sometimes becomes divided into as many small pieces— cartilagines minores vel sesamoidea; but it swells out in front where it touches its fellow, and forms the apex of the nose. The inner part (') is shorter and narrower. It projects backwards in the columna nasi below the level of the anterior end of the septal cartilage, being attached to this and to its fellow of the opposite side by fibrous tissue, and reaches nearly to the superior maxillary bone. The Appendages of the Eye include the eyebrow, the eyelid, and the lachrymal apparatus. Some of these can be examined now on the opposite side of the face.

It consists of thickened integuments, and its prominence is in part due to the subjacent orbicularis palpebrarum and corrugator supercilii . muscles. It is furnished with long coarse hairs, which are directed outwards, and towards one another. The eyelids (palpebral) are two moveable semilunar folds in front Eyelids of the eye, which can be approached or separated over the eyeball. The upper lid is the larger and more moveable, and descends below upper the middle of the eyeball when the two meet; it is also provided with a special muscle to raise it. The interval between the open lids is named the palpebral fissure. Externally and internally they are united by a commissure or canthus. The free border of each lid is somewhat thickened, and presents Shape of a narrow surface which meets the opposite lid when the aperture is marsm- closed, and is bounded towards the eyeball by a sharp smooth edge; but at the inner end, for about a quarter of an inch from the commissure, it is somewhat thinner and more rounded. At the spot where the two parts join is a small white eminence (fig. 13, x), Papilla, the papilla lachrymalis; and in tliis is the punctum lachrymale, or the Punctum. opening of the canal for the tears. This margin is provided anteriorly with the eyelashes, and near Hairs and the posterior edge with a row of small openings of the Meibomian al,ertures- glands : but both the cilia and the glands are absent from the part of the lid which is internal to the opening of the punctum lachrymale. The eyelashes (cilia) are two or more rows of curved hairs, which Eyelashes, are fixed into the anterior edge of the free border of the lid; they are largest in the upper lid, and diminish in length from the centre to the sides. The cilia of the two lids are convex towards one another, and cross when the lids are shut. Structure op the Eyelids. Each lid consists fundamentally Different of a fibrous plate attached to the bone by ligaments. Superficial eylnds" to this framework are the integuments with a layer of fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and beneath it the mucous lining of the conjunctiva. The upper lid includes also the tendon of the levator palpebral. "Vessels and nerves are contained in the lids. Dissection.

At the inner part of the orbit theDISSECTION OF THE FACE. 32 ligament is thin and loose, but at the outer part it is somewhat thicker and stronger. A fibrous The fibrous plates (tarsi), one for each eyelid, are elongated piartCof°theS transversely, and give strength to the lids. Each is fixed internally fid: and externally by fibrous bands—the tarsal ligaments, to the margin of the orbit. The border corresponding with the edge of the lid is free, and thicker than the rest of the plate. On the deep surface each tarsus is lined by the mucous membrane or conjunctiva, difference in The tarsi are not alike in the two lids. In the upper eyelid, ie wo i s. wkere t]ie f[Drous plate is larger, it is crescentic in shape, and is nearly half an inch wide in the centre; and to its fore part the tendon of the levator palpebrae is attached. In the lower lid the tarsus is a narrow band, about two lines broad, with nearly straight borders. Ligaments The internal tarsal ligament (tendo palpebrarum) is a small fibrous attach tarsi, band at the inner side of the orbit, which serves to fix the lids, and is attached to the anterior margin of the lachrymal groove in the upper jaw. It is about a quarter of an inch long, and divides into two processes, which are united with the tarsal plates, one to each. This ligament crosses the lachrymal sac, behind which it sends a fibrous expansion ; and the fleshy fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum arise from it. The external tarsal ligament is a much weaker band uniting the tarsi to the malar bone. Sebaceous ^ The Meibomian or tarsal glands are embedded in the substance of ' the tarsal plates, and can be readily seen through the conjunctiva on the posterior surface of the lids. They extend, parallel to one another, from the free towards the opposite margin of the tarsus; and their number is about thirty in the upper, and twenty in the lower lid. The apertures of the glands open in a line at the free border of the lid near the posterior edge. their Each gland is a small yellowish tube, closed at one end, and structure, haying minute lateral caecal appendages connected with it. The secretion is similar to that of the sebaceous glands of the skin.

The line of reflection is known as the fornix conjunctiva;, and is placed, above and below, some distance beyond the convex margin of the tarsus. Inside the lids the conjunctiva is inseparably united to the tarsi, and has numerous fine papillae. At the free margin of the lids it joins the skin, and through the lachrymal canals and nasal duct it is continuous with the pituitary membrane of the nose. Caruncle Between the eyeball and the inner commissure of the lids is seen a prominent and fleshy-looking body—caruncula lachrymalis (fig. 13, 4), which contains a group of glands, and has a few minute hairs and con- on its surface.

The arteries of the eyelids are Arteries of furnished by the palpebral and lachrymal branches of the oph- 8' thalinic artery :— The palpebral arteries, one for each eyelid, run outwards from Palpebral the inner canthus, lying between the tarsus and the orbicular muscle; and they anastomose externally with the lachrymal artery. From each arch branches are distributed to the structures of the lid. The terminal portion of the lachrymal artery perforates the and lachry- palpebral ligament at the outer part of the orbit, and, after having given small offsets to the upper eyelid, divides into two branches which complete the palpebral arches. The veins of the bids open into the angular, facial and temporal Veins, veins. The nerves of the eyelids are supplied from the ophthalmic and Nerves of superior maxillary divisions of the fifth and the facial nerves. The branches of the ophthalmic nerve which give offsets to the from fifth, upper lid are the following : lachrymal, near the outer part; supra- orbital, about the middle; and supratrochlear and infratrochlear at the inner side. In the lower eyelid there are usually two palpebral branches, inner and outer, of the superior maxillary nerve. Branches of the facial nerve enter both lids at the outer side, and and seventh supply the orbicularis muscle ; they communicate with the offsets of nerve- the fifth nerve. External Ear. The outer ear consists of a broad, projecting Parts of part, named pinna or auricle, and of a tube—meatus auditorius externalear- externus, leading inwards to the middle ear, from which it is separated by the tympanic membrane. The pinna may be now examined on the left side of the head; but the meatus will be described with the anatomy of the ear. The pinna or auricle is an uneven piece of yellow fibro-cartilage, Texture and which is covered with integument, and is fixed to the margin of the p^nna? meatus auditorius externus. It is of a somewhat oval form, with the margin folded and the upper end larger than the lower. The surface next the head is generally convex; and the opposite Surface excavated, but presenting the following elevations and depressions, fossa and7 In the centre is a deep hollow named concha, which is wide above emiaeilce3- but narrow below ; it conducts to the meatus auditorius. In front of the narrowed part of the hollow is a projection of a triangular shape—the tragus, which has some hairs on the inner surface ; and on the opposite side of the same narrow end, rather below the level of the tragus, is placed another projection—the antitragus. The prominent rim-like margin of the ear, which extends into the Margin, concha, is called the helix; and the depression internal to it is the groove or fossa of the Mix. Within the helix, forming the hinder and upper boundary of the concha, is the large eminence of the antihelix, which presents at its upper part a triangular depression, the fossa of the antihelix. .

Occasionally the dissector will not find one or more of the number described below. The muscle of the tragus (fig. 8,!) is always found on the external aspect of the process from which it takes its name. The fibres are short, oblique, or transverse, and extend from the outer to the inner part of the tragus. The muscle of the antitragus (fig. 8, 2) is the best marked of all. It arises from the outer part of the antitragus, and the fibres are directed upwards to be inserted into the pointed extremity of the antihelix. The small muscle of the helix (fig. 8, 4) is often indistinct or absent. It is placed on the part of the rim of the ear that extends into the concha. The large muscle of the helix (fig. 8, 3) arises above the small muscle of the same part, and is inserted into the front of the helix, where this is about to curve backwards. It is usually present. The transverse muscle of the auricle (fig. 8, 6) forms a wide layer, Avhich is situate at the back of the ear in the depression between the helix and the convexity of the concha. It arises from the con- vexity of the cartilage forming the concha, and is inserted into the back of the helix. The muscle is mixed with much fibrous tissue, but it is well seen when that tissue is removed. Actions. .

The cartilage of the pinna (fig. 8) resembles much the external Cartilage ear in form, and presents nearly the same parts. The rim of the ^external helix subsides posteriorly about the middle of the pinna; while ear- anteriorly a small process projects from it, and there is a fissure near the projection. The part of the cartilage forming the fossa of the helix ends on a level with the lowest part of the concha in a Deficient pointed process which is separated from the antitragus by a deep ' notch. The antihelix is continued below into the antitragus. On the posterior aspect of the concha is a strong vertical ridge of cartilage. Interiorly the cartilage is fixed to the margin of the external and at upper auditory aperture in the temporal bone, and forms a portion of the ^atus. meatus auditorius ; but it does not give rise to a complete tube, for at the upper and hinder part that canal is closed by fibrous tissue. In the piece of cartilage forming the outer end of the meatus Its fissures, are two fissures (of Santoiini) : one is directed vertically beneath the base of the tragus : the other passes from before backwards in the floor of the meatus. Some ligaments connect the pinna with the head, and others pass Ligaments; from one point to another of the cartilage. The external ligaments are two bands of fibrous tissue, anterior extrinsic; and posterior. The anterior fixes the fore part of the helix to the root of the zygoma. The posterior passes from the back of the concha to the mastoid process. The chief special ligament crosses intrinsic, the interval between the tragus and the helix, and completes the opening of the auditory meatus. Vessels and nerves of the auricle. The arteries of the auricle are derived from the superficial temporal {ant. auricular branches) and the posterior auricular branches of the external carotid. The veins have a corresponding termination. The skin of the pinna is supplied on the outer surface mainly by the auriculotemporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, on the inner surface in the upper part by the small occipital, and in the lower part, together with the outer aspect of the lobule, by the great auricular ner ve. The auricular branch of tlie vagus also reaches the back of the concha. The muscles are supplied by the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. The facial nerve (fig. 9), or the seventh cranial nerve, is the Outline of motor nerve of the superficial muscles of the head and face. faoial nerva Numerous communications take place between it and the fifth nerve; the chief of these are found above and below the orbit, and over the side of the lower jaw.

Division into two. of the nerve is concealed by the parotid gland, but its ramifications are mostly in front of the glandular mass. To expose the branches of the nerve beyond the parotid gland, raise the skin from the face in the same manner as on the left side. The different branches are then to be sought as they escape from beneath the anterior border of the gland, and are to be followed forwards to their termination. The highest branches to the temple have already been partly dissected above the zygomatic arch; and their junction with the temporal branch of the superior maxillary, and with the supraorbital nerve has been seen. Some still smaller branches are to be traced to the outer part of the orbit, where they enter the eyelids and communicate with the other palpebral nerves ; as these cross the malar bone, a junction is to be found with the subcutaneous malar branch of the fifth nerve. With the duct of the parotid are two or more large branches, which are to be followed below the orbit to their junction with the infraorbital, nasal, and infratrochlear nerves. The remaining branches to the lower part of the face are smaller in size. One joins with the buccal nerve over the lower part of the buccinator muscle ; and one or two others are to be traced forwards to the lower lip, and to the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve. To follow backwards the trunk of the nerve through the gland, the integuments should be taken from the surface of the parotid as on the other side, and the gland should be removed piece by piece. In this proceeding its small branches of comnmnication with the great auricular nerve, and the deep branches joining it from the auriculo-temporal nerve (of the fifth) are to be sought. Lastly, the first small branches of the facial to the ear and to the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles are to be looked for close to the base of the skull before the nerve enters the parotid. The Facial Nerve outside the Skull (fig. 9,15). The nerve issues from the stylo-mastoid foramen, after traversing the aqueduct of Fallopius, and furnishes immediately the three following small branches :— The posterior auricular branch (fig. 9,4) turns upwards in front of the mastoid process, where it communicates with an offset of the great auricular, and is also joined by a branch to the ear from the pneumo-gastric nerve; it ends in auricular and mastoid offsets (p. 8). The branch to the digastric muscle arises generally in common with the next. It is distributed by several offsets to the posterior belly of the muscle near the skull. The branch to the stxjlo-hyoid is a long slender nerve, which is directed inwards, and enters its muscle about the middle. This branch communicates with the sympathetic nerve on the external carotid artery. As soon as the facial nerve has given off these branches, it is directed forwards through the gland, and divides near the ramus of the jaw into two large trunks—temporo-facial and cervico-facial.37 FACIAL NERVE.

Infra- maxillary to neck. orbital nerve (6). The attrahens and attollens aureni muscles are supplied from this set; and a junction takes place above the zygoma with the temporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve (10). The malar branches are directed to the outer side of the orbit, and are distributed to the orbicularis muscle. Communications take place in the eyelids with the palpebral filaments of the fifth nerve, and over the malar bone with the small subcutaneous malar branch of the superior maxillary nerve (9). The infraorbital branches are larger than the rest, and are furnished to the muscles between the eye and mouth. Close to the orbit, and beneath the elevator of the upper lip, a remarkable communication—infraorbital plexus, is formed between these nerves and the infraorbital branches of the superior maxillary (u). After crossing the branches of the fifth nerve, some small offsets of the facial nerve pass inwards to the side of the nose, and others upwards to the inner angle of the orbit, to supply the muscles, and to join the nasal (7) and infratrochlear (8) branches of the ophthalmic nerve. The cervicofacial is smaller than the upper trunk, and distri- butes nerves to the lower part of the face and the upper part of the neck. Its highest branches join the lowest offsets of the temporo- facial division, and thus complete the network on the face. This trunk, while in the parotid, gives twigs to the gland, and is united with the great auricular nerve. The terminal branches distributed from it are buccal, supramaxillary, and inframaxillary. The buccal branches pass forwards towards the angle of the mouth, giving offsets to the buccinator muscle, and terminate in the orbicularis oris. On the buccinator they join the buccal branch (I2) of the inferior maxillary nerve. The supramaxillary brandies course forwards over the lower jaw to the middle line, and supply the muscles of the lower lip and chin. Beneath the depressor ariguli oris these branches of the facial join the offsets of the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve (13). The inframaxillary branch lies below the jaw, and is dis- tributed to the upper part of the neck. The anatomy of this nerve will be given with the dissection of the anterior triangle of the neck (p. 59). Section IV. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Directions.

The cotton wool beneath the eyelids should be taken How to open away, and the bone forming the roof of the orbit may be removed ^h saw in the following manner. Two vertical cuts are to be made with a saw through the frontal bone opposite the inner and outer edges respectively of the anterior opening of the orbit; and then with a chisel these are to be continued backwards along the roof of the chisel, orbit, so as to meet near the optic foramen. The piece of bone in- cluded between the incisions is now to be tilted forwards, but is not to be taken away. Afterwards the rest of the roof of the orbit, which is formed by and boue torccDS the small wing of the sphenoid bone, is to be cut away with the bone forceps, except a narrow ring around the optic foramen ; and any overhanging bone on the outer side, which may interfere with the dissection, should be likewise removed. During the examination of the cavity the eye is to be pulled gently forwards. The periosteum of the orbit is now seen where it has been Periosteum detached from the bone in the dissection. This membrane forms a of orln sac around the contents of the orbit, which is continuous posteriorly with the dura mater through the sphenoidal fissure and the optic foramen, and is closed in front by the palpebral fascia passing from it to the lids (p. 31). It adheres but loosely to the bones, and is perforated behind by apertures for the passage of the vessels and nerves entering the orbit. On the sides, prolongations of the mem- brane accompany the vessels and nerves leaving the cavity. Dissection. The periosteum is next to be divided along the middle Open of the orbit, and to be taken away. After the removal of a little Periosteum- fat, the following nerves, vessels, and muscles come into view ; but it is not needful to remove much of the fat at this stage of the dissection. The frontal nerve and the supraorbital artery are placed in the Position of centre ; the lachrymal nerve and vessels close to the outer wall; e^sed. and the small fourth nerve at the back of the orbit: all these nerves are above the muscles in the cavity. The superior oblique muscle lies on the inner side, and is recognised by the fourth nerve enter- ing it; the levator palpebrse and superior rectus are beneath the frontal nerve ; and the external rectus is partly seen below the lachrymal nerve. At the outer part of the orbit, near the front, is the lachrymal gland. The frontal and lachrymal nerves should be followed forwards Trace supor- to their exit from the orbit, and backwards, with the fourth nerve, floial nerves, through the sphenoidal fissure, to the wall of the cavernous sinus. In tracing them back, it will be expedient to remove the projecting anterior clinoid process, should this still remain ; and some care will be required to follow the lachrymal nerve to its commence- ment. Contents of the orbit. The eyeball and the lachrymal gland, and Orbit has a great quantity of granular fat, are lodged in the orbit.

Lachrymal nerve The nerves in the cavity are numerous, viz., the second, third, fourth, ophthalmic of the fifth, and the sixth, together with the small temporo-malar branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and offsets of the sympathetic ; their general distribution is as follows :— The second nerve enters the eyeball; the third supplies all the muscles of the cavity but two ; the fourth enters the superior oblique ; and the sixth is spent in the external rectus muscle. The fifth nerve supplies some filaments to the eyeball with the sym- pathetic, but the greater number of its branches pass through the orbital cavity to the face. The ophthalmic vessels are also contained in the orbit. The lachrymal gland (fig. 10, p) secretes the tears, and is situate in the hollow on the inner side of the external angular process of the frontal bone. It is of an oval form, something like a small almond, and measures about three-quarters of an inch in its longest diameter, which is directed transversely. From its fore part a thin accessory piece projects beneath the upper eyelid. The upper surface is convex, and in contact with the periosteum, to which it is connected by fibrous bands that constitute a ligament for the gland; the lower surface rests on the eyeball and the external rectus muscle. The gland has from eight to twelve very fine ducts, which open on the surface of the conjunctiva in a curved line above the outer part of the upper eyelid, and a little in front of the fornix. The fourth nerve (fig. 10,') is the most internal of the three nerves entering the orbit above the muscles. In the cavity, it is directed inwards above the levator palpebral to the superior oblique muscle, which it pierces on the orbital surface. The ophthalmic trunk of the fifth nerve (fig. 10), as it approaches the sphenoidal fissure, furnishes from its inner side the nasal branch, and then divides into the frontal and lachrymal branches; the first passes into the orbit between the heads of the external rectus, but the other two lie, as before said, above the muscles. The frontal nerve (fig. 10, 2) is close to the outer side of the fourth as it enters the orbit, and is much larger than the lachrymal branch. In its course to the forehead the nerve lies along the middle of the orbit; and after giving off from its inner side the supratrochlear branch (4), it leaves the cavity by the supraorbital notch. Taking the name supraorbital, it ascends on the forehead, where it is distributed. This nerve frequently divides into its two main branches (p. 6) while still within the orbit. While in the notch the supraorbital nerve gives one or two -palpe- bral filaments to the upper lid. The supratrochlear nerve (') passes inwards above the pulley of the upper oblique muscle, and leaves the orbit to end in the eyelid and forehead (p. 7). Before the nerve turns round the margin of the frontal bone, it sends downwards a twig of communication to the infratrochlear branch of the nasal nerve. The lachrymal nerve (fig. 10, 3) after entering the orbit in aOPHTHALMIC NEEVE. 41 separate canal of the dura mater, is directed forwards in the outer part of the cavity, and beneath the lachrymal gland to the upper eyelid, where it pierces the palpebral fascia, and is distributed ends m to the structures of the lid.

By one surface the muscle is in contact with the frontal nerve and the periosteum ; and by the other with the superior rectus muscle.

The lid is made to glide upwards over the ball by this muscle, so that the upper edge is directed back and the lower forwards, the skin above the lid being folded inwards at the same time. If the eyeball is directed down, the movement of the lid is less free, because the conjunctiva is put on the stretch. The superior rectus (fig. 10, d) is the upper of four muscles that lie around the globe of the eye. It arises from the upper part of the optic foramen, and is connected with the other recti muscles around the optic nerve. In front the fleshy fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted, like the other recti, into the sclerotic coat of the eyeball about a quarter of an inch behind the trans- parent cornea. The under surface of the muscle is in contact with the globe of the eye, and with some vessels and nerves to be afterwards seen; the upper surface is covered by the preceding muscle. The action of the muscle will be given with the other recti (p. 47). The superior oblique muscle (fig. 10, a) is thin and narrow, and passes through a fibrous loop at the inner angle of the orbit before reaching the eyeball. The muscle arises behind from the inner part of the optic foramen, and ends anteriorly in a rounded, tendon, which, after passing through the loop referred to (fig. 11), is reflected backwards and outwards between the superior rectus Use. Dissection. and the globe of the and is inserted into the sclerotic coat behind the middle of the ball. The fourth nerve is supplied to the orbital surface of the muscle and the nasal nerve lies below it. The thin insertion of the mustlie lies between the superior and the external recti, and near the tendon of the inferior oblique. The pulley, or trochlea (fig. 11), is a fibro-cartilaginous ring nearly a quarter of an inch wide, which is attached by fibrous tissue to the depression of the frontal bone at the inner angle of the orbit. A fibrous layer is prolonged from the margins of the pulley on the tendon; and a synovial sheath lines the ring, to facilitate the movement of the tendon through it. To see the synovial sheath and the free motion of the tendon, this prolonga- tion may be cut away. For the use of the muscle, see the description of the inferior oblique (p. 49). Dissection. The superior rectus muscle is next to be divided about the middle and turned backwards (fig. 11), when a branch of the third nerve to its under surface will be found. At the same time the nasal nerve and the ophthalmic vessels will come into view as they cross inwards above the optic nerve : these should be tracedTHIRD AND NASAL NERVES. ■13 forwards to the inner angle, and backwards to the posterior part of the orbit. By taking away the fat between the optic nerve and the external ^j,^1™" rectus, at the back of the orbit, the student will find easily fine ganglion, nerves (ciliary) with small arteries lying along the side of the optic nerve ; and by tracing these ciliary nerves backwards, he will be guided to the small lenticular ganglion (the size of a pin's ■ head). The dissector should find then two branches from the nasal and and roots, third nerves to the ganglion : the nasal branch is slender, and enters the ganglion behind; while that of the third nerve, short and thick, joins the lower part. The eyeball is to be fully exposed by dissecting off its investing clean fascia (capsule of Tenon), which -will be seen to send, processes eveba11- around the several muscles inserted into the sclerotic. Lastly, the student should separate from one another the nasal, Separate third, and sixth nerves, as they pass between the heads of the nerve8- external rectus muscle into the orbit. The third nerve is placed highest in the wall of the cavernous Third nerv sinus (fig. 4, 3); but at the sphenoidal fissure it descends below the fourth, and the two superficial branches (frontal and lachry- mal) of the ophthalmic nerve. It comes into the orbit between as it enters the heads of the outer rectus, having previously divided into two ort>it> parts. The upper division (fig. 11, 8) is the smaller, and ends in its upper the under surface of the levator palpebrse and superior rectus t)rancl1' muscles. The lower division supplies three other muscles, and will be lower dissected afterwards (p. 47). branoh' The NASAL BRANCH OF THE OPHTHALMIC NERVE (fig. 11, ') Nasal nerve, enters the orbit between the heads of the external rectus, lying between the two parts of the third nerve, and is then directed obliquely inwards to reach the anterior of the two internal orbital canals. Passing through this aperture with the anterior ethmoidal Generat (nasal) artery, the nerve appears in the cranium at the outer margin theface." of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Finally, it enters the nasal cavity by an aperture at the front of the cribriform plate; and after passing behind the nasal bone, it issues between that bone and the cartilage, to end on the outer side of the nose. In the orbit the nasal crosses over the optic nerve, but beneath Iu the orbit, the superior rectus and levator palpebrae muscles, and lies afterwards below the superior oblique ; in this part of its course it furnishes the following branches:— The branch to the lenticular ganglion (5) is about half an inch long Branches, and very slender, and arises as soon as the nerve comes into the Lor>g r0°t of orbit: this is the long root of the lenticular ganglion.

By its posterior part the ganglion has Connec- hranches of communication with other nerves (its roots); and from tlons' the anterior part proceed ciliary branches to the eyeball. The gang- lion receives roots from sensory, motor, and sympathetic nerves. The branches of communication are three in number. One, the Three roots: long root (5), is the branch of the nasal nerve before noticed, which long, joins the superior angle. A second branch of considerable thickness, the short root (4), passes to the inferior angle from the branch of the short, third nerve that supplies the inferior oblique muscle. And the sympatlietic root is derived from the cavernous plexus, either in p"^^™" union with the long root, or as a distinct branch to the posterior horder of the ganglion. Branches. The short ciliary nerves (fig. 11) are ten or twelve in Ciliary number, and are collected into two bundles, which leave the upper toeyebaU. and lower angles at the front of the gauglion. In the upper bundle are four or five, and in the lower, six or seven nerves. In their course to the eyeball they lie along the outer and under parts of the optic nerve, and communicate with the long ciliary branches of the nasal nerve. The ophthalmic artert, a branch of the internal carotid, enters Ophthalmic the orbit through the optic foramen. At first the vessel is outside artery' the optic nerve, but it then courses inwards over (or occasionally in the orbit under) the nerve to the inner side of the orbit, and finally perforates the palpebral fascia above the internal tarsal ligament to end by dividing into frontal and nasal branches. The branches of the artery are numerous, though inconsiderable Branches, in size, and may be arranged in three sets :—one arising outside the optic nerve, another above it, and a third set on the inner side. The lachrymal artery accompanies the nerve of the same name Lachrymal to the upper eyelid, where it ends by supplying that part, and ian° joining in the palpebral arches (p. 33). It supplies branches, like the nerve, to the lachrymal gland and the conjunctiva ; and it anas- to gland and tomoses with the large meningeal artery by an offset through the eyelids: sphenoidal fissure. The lachrymal artery also sends a small branch with each of the ?,ffsets, divisions of the temporo-malar nerve ; and these join the temporal maSrgbone and transverse facial arteries. The central artery of the retina is a very small branch which Branch to pierces the optic nerve about half an inch behind the eyeball. &" The sitpraorbital branch arises beneath the levator palpebixe and Bupraprbi- superior rectus muscles; it then takes the course of the nerve of the tal braudu same name through the notch in the margin of the orbit, and ends in branches on the forehead (p. 5). The ciliary branches are uncertain in their place of origin and Ciliary enter the eyeball at the front and back :— arteries are The posterior ciliary, four or five in number, run to the eyeball posterior— around the optic nerve, and divide into a number of branches (from fifteen to twenty), which perforate the sclerotic coat at the posteriorDISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 40 two named long ciliary, and an- terior.

Two of this set (one on each side of the optic nerve), named long ciliary, pierce the sclerotic farther out than the others, and lie along the middle of the eyeball. The anterior ciliary arteries arise from muscular branches of the ophthalmic, and perforate the sclerotic coat near the cornea : in the eyeball they anastomose with the long ciliary. For the ending of these vessels, see the dissection of the eyeball. The muscular branches are uncertain in their place of origin; and those to the lower muscles often arise together as one trunk. The ethmoidal branches are two, anterior and posterior, and are directed through the canals in the inner wall of the orbit :— The posterior is the smaller of the two, and ends in offsets to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the nose and the ethmoidal cells. The anterior branch (internal nasal) accompanies the nasal nerve to the cavity of the nose (Section XIV.), and gives meningeal offsets to the fore part of the falx cerebri and the dura mater of the anterior fossa of the skull The palpebral branches, one for each eyelid, generally arise together opposite the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and then separate from one another. The arches they form have been dissected with the eyelids (p. 33). The frontal branch turns round the margin of the orbit, and is distributed on the forehead (p. 5). The nasal branch (external) supplies the skin and muscles of the upper part of the nose, and anastomoses with the angidar and lateral nasal branches of the facial artery. The ophtlialmic veins are two in number, superior and inferior, and leave the orbit by the spbenoidal fissure, between the heads of the external rectus, to end in the cavernous sinus. The superior vein is the larger and accompanies the artery: it begins in front by a wide communication with the angidar vein, and on its way back- wards it receives tributaries corresponding to most of the offsets of the artery. The inferior vein lies below the optic nerve, and is formed by the lower ciliary and muscular branches ; it communi- cates through the spheno-maxillary fissure with the pterygoid plexus. The supraorbital, frontal and palpebral veins do not join the ophthalmic, but pass to the veins of the face (pp. 6 and 33). The optic nerve in the orbit extends from the optic foramen to the back of the eyeball. As the nerve leaves the foramen it is sur- rounded by the recti, muscles ; and beyond that spot the ciliary arteries and nerves entwine around it. It terminates in the retinal expansion of the eye. Dissection (fig. 12). Take away the ophthalmic vessels, and divide the optic nerve about its middle, together with the small ciliary vessels and nerves. Turn forwards the eyeball, and fasten it iu that position with hooks. On removing some fat the three recti muscles—inner, inferior, and outer, will appear ; and lying on the first two are the offsets of the lower division of the third nerve.EECTI MUSCLES. 17 The LOWER DIVISION OF THE THIRD NERVE (fig. 12) Supplies Lower three muscles in the orbit. As it enters this space, between the heads third'nerve of the external rectus, it lies below the nasal, and rather above the sixth nerve. Almost immediately the nerve divides into three branches. One (5) passes to the internal, another (4) to the inferior ^yM&> rectus, both entering the muscles on their ocular surfaces ; the ' third (8), the longest and most external, is continued forwards to the inferior oblique muscle, which it pierces at the hinder border. Soon after its origin the last branch communicates with the and joins lenticular ganglion, forming the short root (fig. II,4) of that ° body; and it furnishes two or more filaments to the inferior rectus muscle. The sixth nerve (fig. 12, 2) lies below the other nerves, and Sixth nerve, above the ophthalmic veins, in the interval between the heads of the external rectus. In the orbit it first lies against, and then penetrates the inner surface of the external rectus muscle. Eecti Muscles. The internal (fig. 12, d), inferior (c), and Straight external recti (b), are placed with reference to the eyeball as their ^eball ° names express. They arise posteriorly from the circumference of origin, the optic foramen by a common attachment, which partly surrounds the optic nerve. The external rectus differs from the others in having two heads: the upper one joins the superior rectus in the common origin : the lower and larger head blends on the one side with the inferior rectus in the common origin, and on the other side is attached to a bony point on the lower border of the sphenoidal fissure, near the inner end, while some of its muscular fibres are also connected with a tendinous band between the heads. All the Insertion, muscles are directed forwards, the lower also obliquely outwards, and have a tendinous insertion into the ball of the eye about a cpiarter of an inch from the cornea, and in front of the greatest transverse diameter of the ball. Between the heads of origin of the external rectus, the different Between nerves before mentioned are transmitted into the orbit, viz., the outer rectus, third, the nasal branch of the fifth, and the sixth, together with the ophthalmic veins. Action. The four recti muscles, attached to the eyeball at oppo- Use of all. site sides in front of the greatest transverse diameter, are able to turn the pupil in opposite directions. The inner and the outer muscles move the ball horizontally Inner and around a vertical axis, the former directing the pupil towards the °uter' nose and the latter towards the temple. The upper and lower recti elevate and depress the fore part of upper and the ball around a transverse axis ; but as the muscles are directed lowu''' obliquely outwards, the upper muscle turns the pupil up and in, and the lower muscle turns it down and in. By the simultaneous action of two contiguous recti, the ball will and two be moved to a point intermediate to that to which it woidd be contiguous- directed by either muscle singly. Dissection. By opening the optic foramen, the attachment of Dissect infe- the recti muscles will be more fully laid bare.

The inferior oblique muscle (fig. 12, h) is placed near the anterior margin of the orbit, and differs from the other muscles in being directed across, instead of parallel to the axis of the orbit. Fig. 12. It arises from the superior maxillary bone immediately outside the opening of the nasal duct. From this spot the muscle passes out- wards between the inferior rectus and the bone, then between the eyeball and the external rectus, to be inserted into the sclerotic coat between the outer and upper recti. The borders of the muscle look forwards and backwards, and the posterior receives its branch of the third nerve. The insertion of the tendon is near that of the superior oblique muscle, but rather closer to the optic nerve. * Third view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:—a.

The inferior oblique would similarly turn the eye up- wards and outwards. In consequence of their transverse direction, these muscles would also tend to rotate the eyeball around its antero-posterior axis, the superior oblique depressing, and the inferior oblique elevating the inner end of the horizontal meridian of the eye, but movements of this nature take place only to a very limited extent during life. The oblique muscles are believed to act mainly in controlling the and with tendency of the superior, and inferior recti to rotate the eyeball and and^nferior turn it inwards. Thus, to move the eye directly upwards, the recti- superior rectus and the inferior oblique are used, while the inferior rectus and superior oblique co-operate in directing the eye down- wards. Dissection. To expose the small tensor tarsi muscle, the remain- Seek tensor ing portion of the palpebral fascia is to be separated from the margin tarS1, of the orbit; but the lids must be left attached at the inner side by means of the internal tarsal ligament. On clearing away a little areolar tissue in the neighbourhood of the inner commissure, after the lids have been placed across the nose, the pale fibres of the tensor tarsi will be seen. The tensor tarsi muscle arises from the crest of the lachrymal Tensor tarsi bone, and slightly from the bone behind the crest. Its fibres are uu,scle- pale, and form a very small flat band, behind the internal tarsal ligament, which divides like that structure into a slip for each eye- lid.

A small nerve, the orbital branch of the superior Trace offset maxillary trunk, lies along the lower part of the outer wall of the ^^^?yr orbit, and may be brought into view after the removal of the eye- nerve, ball and its muscles. This nerve is very soft and easily broken, and is covered, as it enters the orbit through the spheno-rnaxillary fissure, by pale fleshy fibres (orbitalis muscle). Two branches, temporal and malar, are to be traced forwards from it; and the junction of a filament of the lachrymal nerve with the former is to be sought close to the bone. The outer wall of the orbit may be cut away bit by bit, to follow the temporal branch to the surface of the head.

Orbitalis muscle. At the lower and outer angle of the orbit this thin layer of unstriped muscle is sometimes well seen. The fibres cross the spheno-maxillary fissure, being attached to the edges, aud are pierced by the temporo-malar nerve. Lachrymal Apparatus (fig. 13). The lachrymal gland, puncta, canals, and sac, with the nasal duct, constitute the apparatus by which the tears are formed and conveyed to the nose. The gland has been already described (p. 40). Dissection. A bristle or blunted pin should be introduced into each lachrymal canal through the punctum of the eyelid. The lachrymal sac will appear on removing the tensor tarsi and the areolar tissue from its surface, as it lies on the lachrymal bone. The prolongation from the internal tarsal ligament over the sac should be defined. The puncta lachrijmalia ('), one in each lid, are the openings of the lachrymal canals. Each is situate on the free margin of the lid, about a quarter of an inch from Fig. 13.* the inner can thus, and at the summit of the papilla lachrymalis. The lachrymal canals (canali- culi, fig. 13,2 and3) lead from the puncta, and convey the tears to the lachrymal sac. From the margin of the lid, each canal is directed vertically for about half a line, and then bends inwards, following the course of the inter- nal tarsal ligament. Internally the two canals converge, and they open into the lachrymal sac, rather above its middle, either sepa- rately or by a common orifice. The lachrymal sac and nasal duct extend from the inner side of the orbit to the nose, and convey the tears into the latter cavity. They form one tube, of which the upper dilated end is the sac, and the lower part the duct. The sac (5) is placed in the hollow formed by the nasal process of the superior maxillary and the lachrymal bones. In front, it is crossed by the ligament of the eyelids; and behind, it is covered by * The eyelids and lachrymal apparatus. 1. Puucta lachrymalia. 2. Upper, and 3, lower lachrymal canal. 4.

If the aponeurotic covering be removed, the mucous lining ■will appear. Into the outer side of the sac the lachrymal canals open. The duct (6) is the narrower part of the tube, and is about half an Canal load- inch long. It is entirely surrounded by bone, and inclines slightly no^e°the outwards and backwards as it descends. In the nasal cavity it opens into the fore part of the inferior meatus, where its opening is Its opening, guarded by a small fold of the mucous membrane.

Directions. The examination of the eyeball may be omitted with fp^^-y more advantage till the dissection of the head and neck has been afterwards, completed. The description of the eye will be found in Chapter X. Section V. DISSECTION OP THE NECK. Position. For the dissection of the right side of the neck let the Position of head be supported on a block of a moderate height, and let the tbe part" face be turned to the left side and fastened in that position with hooks. To obtain a good view of the region, the right arm may be drawn tightly under the body, with the object of depressing the point of the shoulder, and putting the neck on the stretch. In some bodies, owing to a difference in the form of the neck, the best position will be obtained by placing the upper limb over, instead of under the chest. Surface-marking. The side of the neck has a somewhat irregularly Boundaries' quadrilateral outline, and is limited in the following way :—Below °[;tjieskle . . „ . . ot Uie neck, is the prominence 01 the clavicle ; and above is the base of the lower jaw with the skull. In front, the boundary is the middle line of the neck between the cliin and sternum ; and behind, a line from the occiput to the acromial end of the clavicle. The part thus included is divided into two triangular spaces (anterior Division and posterior) by the diagonal prominence of the sterno-mastoid tri^ng7ea muscle. And in consequence of the position of that muscle the l,y sterno- base of the anterior space is at the jaw, and the apex at the '"aS °'d' sternum ; while the base of the posterior one is at the clavicle, and the apex at the head. The surface in front of the sterno-mastoid is depressed at the Hollows, upper part of the neck, near the position of the carotid vessels ; and behind the muscle, just above the clavicle, is another hollow which indicates the situation of the subclavian artery. Along the front of the neck the following parts can be recognised Objects in through the skin :—About two inches and a half from the chin, in |rf22?klto8 the retiring angle formed by the outline of the front of the neck, e 2DISSECTION OF THE NECK. the body of the hyoid bone may be felt, with its large comu extending backwards on each side. Below this is the prominence of the thyroid cartilage, called pomum Adami, which is more marked in the male sex ; and between the cartilage and the hyoid bone is a slight interval, corresponding with the thyro-hyoid membrane. Below the thyroid is the narrow prominent ring of the cricoid cartilage ; and between the two the finger may distinguish another interval, which is opposite the crico-thyroid membrane. Immediately above the sternum, and boimded on each side by the prominent sterno-mastoid muscle, is a narrow depression, the depth of which is much increased in emaciated persons, and in which the tube of the trachea can be recognised. In some bodies, especially in women, the swelling of the thyroid gland may be felt by the Bide of the air tube. Directions. As the time for turning the body will not allow the examination of the whole side of the neck, the student should lay bare now only the part behind the sterno-mastoid muscle. Dissection. To raise the skin from the posterior triangle of the neck, make an incision along the sterno-mastoid muscle from the tip of the mastoid process to the clavicle one inch external to its articulation with the sternum; from the upper end of this carry a cut backwards two-thirds of the distance to the external occipital protuberance, and from the lower end another cut outwards along the clavicle as far as the acromion. The skin is to be reflected from before back towards the trapezius muscle. The superficial fascia, which will then be brought into view, contains the platysina ; and to see that muscle, it will be necessary to take the subcutaneous layer from the surface of the fibres. The PLATYSHA myoides is a thin subcutaneous muscular layer, which is now seen only in its posterior half. The muscle is placed across the side of the neck, and extends from the top of the shoulder to the face. Its fleshy fibres take origin from the snbcntaneous tissue over the clavicle and acromion, as well as from that covering the highest parts of the pectoral and deltoid muscles ; ascending through the neck, the fibres are inserted into the jaw and the angle of the mouth. The lower part of the muscle is more closely united to the skin than the upper, and covers the external jugular vein as well as the lower part of the posterior triangle. At first the fibres of the^ muscle are thin and scattered, but they increase in strength as they ascend. The oblique direction of the fibres should be noted, because in venesection in the external jugular vein the incision is to be so made as to divide them transversely. The action will be found with the description of the remainder of the muscle (p. 58). Dissection. The platysma is to be cut across near the clavicle, and to be reflected forwards as far as the incision over the sterno- mastoid muscle, but it is to be left attached at that spot. In raising the muscle the student must be careful of the deep fascia of the neck; and he should dissect out the external jugular vein, with thePOSTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. 63 superficial descending branclies of the cervical plexus, which are close beneath the platysma. The EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN (fig. 14, 8) begins just behind the External angle of the jaw by the union of the posterior division of the tern- vein ^ poro-maxillary with the posterior auricular vein (fig. 15). Descend- ing beneath the platysma to the lower part of the neck, it there pierces the deep cervical fascia to open into the subclavian vein. Its course ^IJj.8^16 down the neck will be marked by a line from the angle of the jaw subclavian, to the middle of the clavicle. Beyond the stemo-mastoid muscle the vein is dilated, and the swollen part (sinus) is limited by two pairs of valves,—one being situate below at the mouth of the vein, and the other near the muscle. Small superficial branches join the vein, and an offset connects it with the anterior jugular vein. Its size and the height at which it crosses the sterno-mastoid muscle, are very uncertain. The deep cervical fascia, like the aponeuroses in other regions Cervical of the body, consists of a superficial layer which surrounds the neck fasoia- continuously, and of processes that are prolonged inwards between the muscles. In some bodies this fascia is thin and indistinct. In its extent round the neck the membrane encases the sterno- mastoid, and has a different disposition before and behind that muscle. As now seen passing backwards from the muscle, the ^^^nd fascia continues over the posterior triangular space, and encloses the toid muscle trapezius in its progress to the spines of the vertebrae. At the lower part of the neck it is attached to the clavicle, and is perforated by the external jugular vein and the cutaneous nerves. After the superficial layer has been removed near the clavicle, a sends a pro- deep process may be observed surrounding the omo-hyoid muscle, omo-hyoUL1 and passing downwards behind the clavicle, to be fixed to the back of that bone, and the anterior end of the first rib. posterior triangular space. This space (fig. 14), having the form and position before noted, Posterior is about eight inches in length. It contains the cervical and brachial space5 of"1 plexuses, with the portion of the subclavian artery on which a tne neck- ligature is usually placed, and some offsets of the vessel and the nerves. Dissection. By the removal of the cervical fascia and the fat Dissection between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles, the posterior of the space< triangle of the neck will be displayed. In the execution of this somewhat difficult task the student should proceed cautiously, to avoid injuring the numerous nerves and vessels in the space. Seek first the small omo-hyoid muscle (fig. 14, 3), which crosses Find omo- the space obliquely about an inch above the clavicle, and divides it hyoid" into two. Close to or beneath the upper border of the muscle lie the slender nerve and vessels to it: the nerve is derived from the descendens noni, and the artery from the suprascapular.

Branches of vessels. cervical plexus, together with the spinal accessory nerve ; the latter will he recognised hy its piercing the sterno-mastoid muscle. The greater numher of the branches of the cervical plexus descend to the shoidder ; hut the small occipital and great auricular nerves ascend to the head, and the superficial cervical branch is directed forwards over the sterno-mastoid muscle. Below the omo-hyoid find the large subclavian artery and the brachial plexus, which have a deep position, and run downwards and outwards. Also the following vessels and nerve are to be sought, viz., the suprascapular vessels behind the clavicle ; the trans- verse cervical vessels, which are higher in the neck, taking an out- ward direction beneath the omo-hyoid muscle; and, lastly, the small branch of nerve to the subclavius muscle, which lies about the middle of the space between the clavicle and the omo-hyoid. Underneath the trapezius, where it is attached to the clavicle, define the serratus magnus muscle ; and behind the brachial plexus, towards the lower part of the space, the middle scalenus muscle appears. Through the scalenus issue two muscular nerves ; one, formed by two or three roots, for the serratus magnus ; the other smaller, and higher up, for the rhomboidei. Lim its of the space. The space is bounded in front by the sterno- mastoid muscle (') ; and behind by the trapezius (2). Its base corre- sponds with the middle third of the clavicle, and its apex is at the skull. In its area are several muscles, which are placed in the following order from above down, viz., splenius capitis, levator anguk' scapulae (G), and middle scalenus (5) ; and at the lower and outer angle, somewhat beneath the trapezius, lies the upper part of the serratus magnus. Covering the space are the structures already examined, viz., the skin and superficial fascia, the platysma over the lower half or two-thirds, and the 'deep fascia. The small omo-hyoid muscle (3) crosses the space near the clavicle, so as to divide it into two, a lower or clavicular, and an upper or occipital part. The clavicular part is the smaller, and contains the subclavian artery. It is triangular in form, with its base directed forwards, and is hounded in front by the sterno-mastoid ('), above by the omo-hyoid (3), and below by the clavicle. This space measures commonly about two inches from before backwards, and about one inch from above down at its base. Crossing the area of this space, rather above the level of the clavicle, is the trunk of the subclavian artery (7), which issues from beneath the anterior scalenus muscle, and is directed over the first rib to the axilla. In the ordinary condition of the vessel the com- panion subclavian vein is seldom seen, owing to its being placed lower down behind the clavicle. Above the artery are the large cords of the brachial plexus (9), which accompany the vessel, and become closely applied to it beneath the clavicle. Behind the artery and the nerves is the middle scalenus muscle (s). And below the vessel is the first rib. Along the lower boundary of the space, and rather beneath theCLAVICULAR PAET OF POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. clavicle He the suprascapular vessels ; and crossing the upper angle, at'the meeting of the onio-hyoid and sterno-mastoid muscles, are the transverse" cervical vessels. Entering the space from above is the external jugular vein (8), which descends over (seldom under) the omo-hyoid, and opens into the subclavian vein; in this region Fig. 14.* the vein receives the suprascapular and transverse cervical branches, and sometimes a small vein over the clavicle, from the cephalic vein of the arm. * Part of the posterior triangle of the neck is here displayed, but the student should carry the dissection as high as the head, so as to lay bare the whole of that space. 1.

Occipital part of space contains nerves and lymphatics; also spinal accessory nerve. Nerves of the cervical plexus that asceud, viz.— Small occipital. The length of the clavicular part of the space depends mainly upon the extent of the attachment of the trapezius and sterno- mastoid muscles to the clavicle : in some hodies these muscles occupy nearly the whole length of that hone, leaving but a small interval between them ; and occasionally they meet, so as to cover the subclavian arteiy altogether. The space also varies in height according to the position of the omo-hyoid, for this muscle some- times lies close to, or even arises from the clavicle, while on the other hand, it may be distant one inch and a half from that bone. In depth the space varies naturally ; and in a short thick neck with a prominent clavicle, the artery is farther from the surface than in the opposite condition of the parts. But the depth may be altered much more by change in the position of the clavicle, as the shoulder is carried forwards or backwards. And lastly, the artery may be concealed entirely in its usual position by forcing upwards the arm and shoulder, as the collar bone can be raised above the level of the omo-hyoid muscle. The position of the subclavian artery itself is also subject to variation, for the vessel may be one inch and a half above the clavicle, or at any point intermediate between this and the bone. In the typical condition there is not any branch arising from the trunk in this part of its course; but the posterior scapular artery (fig. 14) is frequently given off beyond the scalenus, and sometimes there is more than one branch. The subclavian vein occasionally rises upwards as high as the artery ; or in some rare instances, it even lies with the artery beneath the anterior scalenus. The position of the external jugular vein with regard to the subclavian artery is very uncertain; and the branches connected with its lower end often form a kind of plexus over the arterial trunk. The occipital part of the posterior triangle is larger than the other. Its boundaries in front and behind are the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius; and it is separated from the clavicular portion by the omo-hyoid muscle. In it are contained chiefly the ramifications of the cervical plexus ; and a chain of lymphatic glands lies along the sterno- mastoid muscle. The spinal accessory nerve (10) is directed obliquely across this interval from the sterno-mastoid muscle, which it pierces, to the imder surface of the trapezius ; and a communica- tion takes place between it and the spinal nerves in the space. Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus. These nerves emerge from beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle about the middle of its hinder border, and are thence directed both upwards and downwards. The ascending set (fig. 14) are three in number, viz., small occipital, great auricular, and superficial cervical. The small occipital branch (fig. 2, 2) comes from the second, and in most cases also from the third cervical nerves, and is directed upwards to the head along the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid muscle. It perforates the fascia near the skull, and is dis-BEANCHES OF CEEVICAL PLEXCTS. •r<7 tributed between the ear and the great occipital nerve (p. 8). Occasionally there is a second cutaneous nerve to the back of the head. The great auricular nerve (fig. 2, ') is derived from the second Great auri- and third cervical nerves. Perforating the deep fascia at the pos- terior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the nerve is directed upwards beneath the platysma towards the lobule of the ear, and ends in the following branches :— The facial branches are sent forwards to the integuments over the ^Pjies parotid, and a few slender filaments pass into the gland to join the am ' facial nerve. The auricular branches ascend to the external ear, and are chiefly auricular, distributed on its cranial aspect, but one or more reach the lower part of the outer surface. On the ear they communicate with branches furnished from the facial and pneumo-gastric nerves. The mastoid branch is directed backwards to the skin over the b^1^fstoid mastoid process, where it joins the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve (p. 36). The superficial cervical nerve (fig. 2, 14) arises from the cervical Superficial plexus in common with the preceding, and turns forwards round uervef" the sterno-mastoid muscle about the middle. Afterwards it pierces the fascia, and ramifies over the anterior triangular space (seep. 59). There may be more than one branch to represent this nerve. The descending set of branches (fig. 2) are derived from the Nerves that third and fourth nerves of the plexus, and are directed towards the tes em 0X0 clavicle over the lower part of the triangular space; Their number is somewhat micertain, but usually there are about three near the clavicle. The most internal branch (sternal) crosses the clavicle near its supraclavi- inner end ; the middle branch (clavicular) lies about the middle of cular" that bone ; and the external (acromial) turns over the clavicular attachment of the trapezius to the acromion. All are distributed to the skin of the chest and shoulder. Derived from the descending set are one or two 'posterior cutaneous Posterior nerves of the neck, which ramify in the integument covering the cutaneous trapezius above the scapula. The lymphatic glands lying along the sterno-mastoid (glandulse Lymphatic concatenatae) are some of the deep cervical glands, and are continuous nifck!" "f through the lower part of the posterior triangular space with the glands of the axilla. A chain of superficial cervical glands accom- panies the external jugular vein ; and close to the skull, over the apex of the posterior triangular space, are one or two small sub- occipital glands; while farther forwards, resting on the insertion of the sterno-mastoid, there are two or three small mastoid glands. Directions. The dissection of the posterior triangle should be re- Directions, peated on the left side of the neck, in order that the difference in the vessels may be observed. Afterwards, the reflected parts are to be replaced and carefully fastened in their natural position with a few stitches, preservative fluid or salt having been previously applied. The body is now to be turned for the examination of the back ; The back toDISSECTION OF THE NECK. oS be examined and during tte time allotted for this position the Jjssector of fllfe head is to learn the posterior part of the neck. (See the dissec- tion OF THE BACK.) Remove After the completion of the back, the student should take out the spinal cord. spiQal ^ retum to tlie dissection of the front of the neck, which is described below. FRONT OF THE NECK. Detach the head. Examine right side of neck. Position of part. Dissection to raise skin, to show platysma. Anterior part of platysma. Insertion into jaw. Crossing of the fibres. Dse on mouth, in swallow- ing. Dissection. Directions. After the thorax and back are finished, the head and neck may be detached from the trunk by dividing the spinal column between the second and third dorsal vertebra?, and cutting through the arch of the aorta beyond its large branches (if this is not done), so as to take that piece of the vessel with the head. The dissector con- tinues his work on the remainder of the right side of the neck ; but if the facial nerve lias been omitted, it should be first learnt (p. 35). Position. Supposing the facial nerve completed, a small narrow block is to be placed beneath the left side of the neck, and the face is to be turned from the dissector. Farther, the neck is to be made tense by means of hooks, the chin being well raised at the same time. Dissection. An incision along the base of the jaw on the right side (if it has not been made already) will allow the piece of integument in front of the sterno-mastoid to be raised towards the middle line. Beneath the skin is the superficial fat, containing very fine offsets of the superficial cervical nerve. To define the platysma muscle, remove the fat which covers it, carrying the knife down and back in the direction of the fleshy fibres. Platysma mtoides. The anterior part of the platysma, viz., from the stemo-mastoid muscle to the lower jaw, covers the greater por- tion of the anterior triangular space. At the base of the jaw it is inserted between the symphysis and the masseter muscle ; while other and more posterior fibres are continued over the face, joining the depressor anguli oris and risorius, as far as the fascia covering the parotid gland, or even to the cheek-bone. The fibres have the same appearance in this as in the posterior half of the muscle (p. 52), but they are rather stronger. Below the chin the inner fibres of opposite muscles cross for about an inch, but those which are superficial do not always belong to the same side in different bodies. Action. The binder part of this muscle draws the corner of the mouth downwards and outwards ; the fore part is used in swallow- ing, and carries forwards the skin of the upper part of the neck, thus facilitating the upward movement of the larynx. When the muscle contracts forcibly, the skin of the upper part of the chest and shoulder is also raised. Dissection. Kaise the platysma to the base of the jaw, and dissect out beneath it the branches of the superficial cervical nerve, and the cervical branch of the facial nerve. Clean also the deep69 FEONT OF NECK. fascia of the neck, and the anterior jugular vein which is placed near the middle line. The superficial cervical nerve has heen traced from its origin Superficial in the cervical plexus to its position on the deep fascia of the neck nervej (p. 57). Beneath the platysma it divides into an upper and a lower branch :— The upper branch perforates the platysma, and ends in the skin ascending, over the anterior triangle, extending about half way down the neck. While beneath the platysma this branch joins the facial nerve. The lower branch likewise passes through the platysma, and is descending distributed to the integuments below the preceding, reaching as bKmoli- low as the sternum. The INFRAM AXILLARY BRANCH OF THE FACIAL NERVE (p. 38) branch »f pierces the deep cervical fascia, and divides into slender offsets which tc0 tL neck, pass forwards beneath the platysma, and form arches across the side of the neck (fig. 9), reaching as low as the hyoid bone. Most of the branches end in the platysma, but a few filaments perforate it, and reach the integuments. Beneath the muscle there is a communica- tion between this branch of the facial and the upper division of the superficial cervical nerve. Dissection. Cut across the external jugular vein about the middle, Dissection, and throw the ends up and down. Afterwards the superficial nerves of the front of the neck may be divided in a line with the angle of the jaw, the anterior ends being removed, and the posterior reflected. The great auricular nerve may be cut through and the ends reflected. The part of the deep cervical fascia in front of the sterno- Cervical mastoid is stronger than that over the posterior triangle (p. 53), and front of has the following arrangement. Above, it is fixed to the base of the ste™°- n . . ° i i mastoid, lower jaw, and is continued over the parotid gland to the zygoma. A thickened band jmsses backwards from the angle of the jaw to the sheath of the sterno-ihastoid, and holds forwards the anterior border of that muscle. Above this, a deep process is sent inwards from the hinder margin of the ramus of the jaw, between the parotid and submaxillary glands, to the styloid process, giving rise to the stylo- maxillary ligament. In front, the fascia is attached to the body of the hyoid bone ; and below, to the sternum. Its lower part forms a dense white membrane, which near the manubrium becomes divided into two layers, one in front and the other behind, so as to enclose a small space containing a little fat and the transverse branch of comimmication between the anterior jugular veins. Layers of the membrane are prolonged between the muscles ; and Intermua- that beneath the sterno-mastoid is continuous with the sheath of oular strata- the cervical vessels. One of these, beneath the sterno-thyroid muscles, descends in front of the great vessels at the root of the neck to the arch of the aorta and the pericardium.60 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR BrACE. Anterior triangular space. Dissection of anterior triangle. Trace arteries. Seek longi- tudinal and trans- verse nerves. Spinal accessory. Laryngeal nerves. Clean gland, seek nerve to mylo- hyoid. This space (fig. 15) contains the carotid vessels and their branches, with many nerves ; and it corresponds with the hollow on the surface of the neck in front of the sterno-niastoid muscle. Dissection. To define the anterior triangular space and its contents, take away the deep fascia of the neck and the subjacent fat, but without injuring or displacing the several parts. First clean the surface of the muscles below the hyoid bone, leaving untouched the anterior jugular vein. The trunks into which the large carotid artery bifurcates are to be followed upwards, especially the more superficial one (external carotid), the branches of which are to be traced as far as they lie in the space. In removing the sheath from the vessels, as these appear from beneath the muscles at the lower part of the neck, the dissector should be careful of the small descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve on the surface of the artery. In the sheath between the vessels (carotid artery and jugular vein) will be found the pi: eumo-gastric nerve, and behind the sheath lies the sympathetic nerve. Clean the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, which cross the space in the direction of a line from the mastoid process to the hyoid bone, and beneath them look for several nerves. Thus, crossing the carotid arteries just below the digastric is the hypoglossal nerve, which gives one branch (descendens noni) in front of the artery, and another smaller one to the thyro-hyoid muscle. Under cover of the muscles, and taking a similar direction between the two carotid arteries, are the glossopharyngeal nerve and the stylo- pharyngeus muscle. Directed downwards and backwards from beneath the same muscles to the sterno-mastoid is the spinal accessory nerve. Boundaries. On the inner side of the vessels, between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage, the dissector will find the superior laryngeal nerve ; and by the side of the larynx, with the descending part of the superior thyroid artery, the small external laryngeal branch. Clean then the submaxillary gland close to the base of the jaw ; and on partly displacing it from the surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, the student will expose the small branch of nerve to that muscle with the submental artery. The interval between the jaw and the mastoid process has been already cleaned by the removal of the parotid gland in the dissec- tion of the facial nerve. Limits of the space. Behind, is the stemo-mastoid muscle (') ; and in front, the boundary is formed by a line from the cbin to the sternum, along the middle of the neck. Above, at the base of the space, are the lower jaw, the skull, and the ear; and below, at the apex, is the sternum. Over this space are placed the skin, the superficial fascia with the platsyma, the deep fascia, and the ramifi- cations of the facial and superficial cervical nerves, together with the anterior jugular vein.61 ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. Muscles in the space. In the area of the triangular interval, as it Contents of is above defined, are seen the larynx and pharynx in part, and the space- many muscles converging towards the hyoid hone, some being above and some below it. Below are the depressors of that bone, viz., omo-hyoid, stemo-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid, (2 to 4); and above are the elevator muscles, viz., mylo-hyoid, digastric, and stylo-hyoid. Fig. 15.* Connected with the back of the hyoid bone and the larynx are some of the constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Vessels in the triangular space. The carotid blood vessels (6 and ") ^g™1],, occupy the hinder and deeper part of the space along the side of space, the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and their course would be marked on Course.' the surface by a line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. As high as the level of the cricoid cartilage they are buried beneath Coverings. * Anterior triangular space of the neck (Quain's "Arteries"). 1. Sterno- mastoid. 2. Stemo-hyoid. 3.

For a short distance after its exit from heneath the depressor muscles of the hyoid hone, the common carotid artery remains a single trunk j hut opposite the upper horder of the thyroid cart i- lage it divides into two large vessels, external and internal carotid. From the place of division these arteries are continued onwards heneath the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles to the interval hetween the jaw and the mastoid process. At first the trunks lie side hy side, the vessel destined for the internal parts of the head (internal carotid) heing the posterior of the two ; hut ahove the digastric muscle it becomes deeper than the other. The more superficial artery (external carotid) furnishes many branches to the neck and the outer part of the head, viz., some forwards to the larynx, tongue, and face ; others backwards to the occiput and the ear ; and others upwards to the head. But the common carotid does not always clivide as here said. For the point of branching of the vessel may be moved from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, either upwards or down- wards, so that the trunk may remain undivided till it is beyond the hyoid bone, or end in branches opposite the cricoid cartilage. The division bejTond the usual place is more frequent than the branching short of that spot. It may ascend as an undivided trunk (though very rarely) furnishing offsets to the neck and head. In close contact with the outer side of both the common and the internal carotid artery, and encased in a sheath of fascia with them, is the large internal jugular vein, which receives branches in the neck corresponding to some of the branches of the superficial artery. In some bodies the vein covers the artery ; and the branches joining it above may form a kind of plexus over the upper end of the common carotid. Nerves in tlie space. In connection with the large vessels are the following nerves with a longitudinal direction :—On the surface of the common carotid artery, and most frecjuently within the sheath, lies the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve; between the artery and jugular vein is the pnemno-gastric nerve; and behind the sheath is the sympathetic nerve. Along the outer side of the vessels the spinal accessory nerve extends for a short distance, until it pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle. Several nerves are placed across the vessels:—thus, directed transversely over the two carotids, so as to form an arch below the digastric muscle, is the hypoglossal nerve giving off its descending branch (descendens noni). Appearing on the inner side of the carotid arteries, close to the base of the space, is the glosso-pharyn- geal nerve, which courses forwards between them. To the inner side of the internal carotid artery, opposite the hyoid bone, (lie superior laryngeal nerve comes into sight ; while a little lower down, with the descending branches of the thyroid artery, is the externa] laryngeal branch of that nerve.63 STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID. Glands in the space. Two large glandular bodies, the sub-maxil- Glands; lary (fig. 16,") and thyroid (12), have their seat in this triangular space ^"iaxil~ of the neck. The submaxillary gland is placed altogether in front of the vessels, and is partly concealed by the jaw : beneath it, on the surface of the mylo-hyoid, is the small nerve to that muscle, with the submental artery. By the side of the thyroid cartilage, and thyroid between it and the common carotid artery, lies the thyroid body body- beneath the sternothyroid muscle : in the female this body is more largely developed than in the male. At the base of the space, if the parts were not disturbed, would Parotid be the parotid gland, which is wedged into the hollow between the gland* jaw and the mastoid process, and projects somewhat below the level of the jaw. Its relations have been noticed at p. 28. Several lymphatic glands, belonging to the deep cervical group, Lymphatic lie along the internal jugular vein, under cover of the sterno-glands- mastoid muscle ; and another set of smaller glands (submaxillary lymphatic glands) is placed below the base of the jaw. Directions. The student has to proceed next with the examination of the individual parts that have been referred to in the triangular spaces. Anterior jugular vein. This vein lies near the middle line Anterior of the neck, and its size is dependent upon the degree of develop- •'usular vcin ment of the external jugidar. Beginning in some small branches below the chin, the vein descends to the sternum, and then bends outwards beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, to open into the external jugular, or into the subclavian vein. In the neck the anterior and joins exter- external iujmlar veins communicate. There are two anterior veins, ""'jugular vein one for each side, though one is usually larger than the other ; and at the bottom of the neck they are joined by a transverse branch. In many subjects the lower part of the anterior jugular vein is joined by a considerable branch which runs downwards, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, from the facial vein. The STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID MUSCLE (fig. 15, ') foriUS the Super- Sterno-mas- ficial prominence of the side of the neck. It is narrower in the *old muscle centre than at the ends, and arises below by two heads of origin which are separated by an elongated interval. The inner has its head is fixed by a narrow tendon to the anterior surface of the °fisin at first piece 01 the sternum ; and the outer head has a wide fleshy and clavicle, attachment to the sternal third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are directed upwards, the internal passing backwards, and the external almost vertically, and join about the middle of the neck in a flattened belly. Near the skull the muscle ends in a and inser- broad tendon, which is inserted into the mastoid process at the outer tionatsk,lU- aspect from tip to base, and by a thin aponeurosis into a rough surface behind that process, and into the outer part of the upper curved line of the occipital bone. The muscle divides the lateral surface of the neck into two Position to triangular spaces. On its cutaneous aspect the sterno-mastoid is otll6r parts- covered by the integuments, the platysma and the deep fascia, and is crossed by the external jugular vein, and by the great auricular and superficial cervical nerves. If the muscle be cut throughDISSECTION OF THE NECK. below and raised, it will be seen to lie on the following parts : The clavicular origin is superficial to the anterior scalenus and omo- hyoid, muscles ; and the sternal head conceals the depressors of the hyoid bone, and the common carotid artery with its vein and nerves. After the union of the heads, the muscle is placed over the cervical plexus, the middle scalenus, and the elevator of the angle of the scapula ; and near the skull on the digastric and splenius muscles, the occipital artery, and part of the parotid gland. The spinal accessory nerve perforates the muscular fibres about the junction of the upper and middle thirds. Action. Both muscles acting bend the cervical part of the spine, carrying the head forwards ; but one muscle will turn the face to the opposite side. In conjunction with other muscles attached to the mastoid process, one sterno-mastoid will incline the head, towards the shoulder of the same side. In laborious respiration the two muscles will assist in elevatmg the sternum. The omohyoid muscle crosses beneath the sterno-mastoid, and consists of two fleshy bellies united by a small intermediate tendon (fig. 14, 3). The origin of the muscle from the scapula, and the relations of the posterior belly are to be studied in the dissection of the back. From the intervening tendon the anterior Meshy belly (fig. 15, 3) is directed upwards along the outer border of the sterno-hyoid muscle, and is inserted into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone, close to the great cornu. The anterior belly is in contact with the fascia, after escaping from beneath the sterno-mastoid, and rests on the s'erno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid. This part of the muscle crosses the carotid vessels on a level with the cricoid cartilage. Action. The omo-hyoid muscle depresses and tends to draw back- wards the hyoid bone. The sterxo-hyoid muscle (fig. 15,2) is a flat thin band nearer the middle line than the preceding. It arises from the inner end of the clavicle at its posterior aspect, from the back of the manubrium and the cartilage of the first rib. From this origin it ascends to be inserted into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone, internal to the preceding muscle. Its fibres are often interrupted near the clavicle by a tendinous intersection. One surface is covered by the sterno-mastoid and the fascia. When the muscle is divided and turned aside, the deep surface will be found to touch the sterno-thyroid, the thyro-hyoid, and the thyroid cartilage. The right and left muscles are separated by an interval which is wider below. Action. It draws the hyoid bone downwards after swallowing; and in laborious respiration it will aid in raising the sternum. The sterno-thyroid muscle is broader and shorter than the sterno-hyoid, beneath which it lies. It arises from the posterior surface of the sternum and cartilage of the first rib below the sterno- hyoid, and is inserted into the oblique line on the side of the thyroid cartilage, where it meets the thyro-hyoid muscle.65 THYRO-HYOID MUSCLE. The inner border touches its fellow below, while the outer Relations, reaches over the carotid artery. The superficial surface is for the most part covered by the preceding hyoid muscles; and the opposite surface is in contact with the lower part of the common carotid artery, the trachea, the larynx, and the thyroid body. A transverse tendinous line frequently crosses the muscle near the sternum. Action. Its chief use is to draw downwards the larynx after Use. deglutition, but in conjunction with the following muscle it can also act on the hyoid bone. Like the sterno-hyoid it participates in the movement of the chest in laborious breathing. The thyrohyoid muscle (fig. 15, 4) forms a continuation of ThyTo-hyoid the sterno-thyroid. Arising from the oblique line of the thyroid musclei cartilage, the fibres ascend to the anterior half of the great eornu, and to the outer part of the body of the hyoid bone. On the muscle lie the omo-hyoid and the sterno-hyoid; and beneath it are the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels. Action. It draws up the larynx towards the hyoid bone, as in Use. swallowing. The sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid together fix the thyroid cartilage for the action of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. Directions. The remaining parts included in this section are the scaleni muscles and the subclavian blood-vessels, with the cervical nerves and the carotid blood-vessels. The student may examine them in the order here given. Dissection (fig. 16). Supposing the sterno-mastoid cut, the fat Dissection and fascia are to be taken away from the lower part of the neck, so as to prepare the scaleni muscles with the subclavian vessels and their branches. By means of a little dissection the anterior scalenus muscle will be seen ascending from the first rib to the lower cervical vertebrae, having the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein in front of it, the latter crossing it near the rib. The part of the subclavian artery on the inner side of the of the sui> scalenus is then to be cleaned, care being taken not only of its artery" branches, but of the branches of the sympathetic nerve which course over and along it from the neck to the chest. This dissec- tion will be facilitated by the removal of the remaining part of the clavicle. All the branches of the artery are in general easily found, except and its the superior intercostal, which is to be sought in the thorax in front branclies; of the neck of the first rib. On the branch (inferior thyroid) ascending to the thyroid body, or near it, is the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and the dissector should follow down- wards from it a small cardiac nerve to the thorax. Only the origin . and first part of the arterial branches can be now seen; their termination is met with in other stages of this dissection, or in the dissection of other parts of the body. Next the student should seek the small right lymphatic duct of right lym- that opens into the subclavian vein at its junction with the internal PUati(;duct; jugular. A notice of it will be given with the lymphatics of the thorax.DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 66 of brachial plexus; The outer part of the subclavian artery having been already prepared, let the dissector remove more completely the fibrous tissue from the nerves of the brachial plexus. From the plexus trace the small branch to the subclavius muscle, and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles, which pierce the middle scalenus. Fig. 16.* of cervicul plexus. If it is thought necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied. Clean the cervical plexus, and seek its muscular branches, the small twigs to join the descendens noni, and the roots of the phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the middle scalenus muscle be defined, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. * A view of the common carotid and subclavian arteries(Quain's" Arteries"). 1.

G7 The scaleni muscles are usually described as three in number, Number of and are named from their relative position, anterior, middle, and ^Uscius. posterior ; they extend from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae to the first and second ribs. The scalenus anticus (fig. 16,') is somewhat conical in shape, Scalenus and arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of antl<;us- the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebra. It is inserted 0rigin • insertion into the upper surface and inner border of the first rib, surrounding the rough mark or projection on this part of the bone known as the scalene tubercle. More deeply seated below than above, the muscle is concealed by Relations, the clavicle and the clavicular part of the stemo-mastoid: the phrenic nerve lies along its anterior surface, and the subclavian vein with vessels, crosses over it near the rib. Along the inner border is the internal jugular vein. Beneath it are the pleura, the subclavian artery, and and nerves, the nerves of the brachial plexus. The attachment to the vertebra corresponds with the origin of the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Action. The anterior muscle raises strongly the first rib, in conse- Use- quence of its forward attachment. If the rib is fixed, it bends forwards the lower part of the neck. The scalenus medius muscle (fig. 16, 2) is larger than the Scalenus anterior, and extends highest of all on the vertebrae. Its origin is mediUs- from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of all the 0ngin • cervical vertebra (fig. 45, d) ; and it is inserted into an impression insertion, on the upper surface of the first rib, extending from the tuberosity behind to the groove for the subclavian artery in front. In contact with the anterior surface are the subclavian artery Parts in and the cervical nerves, together with the sterno-mastoid muscle ; withTt the posterior surface touches the posterior scalenus, and the deep lateral muscles of the back of the neck. The fibres are perforated by the nerves of the rhomboid and serratus muscles. Action. Usually it elevates the first rib. With the rib fixed, the tJse. cervical part of the spine can be inclined laterally by one muscle. The scalenus posticus (fig. 45, f) is inconsiderable in size, and Scalenus appears to be part of the preceding muscle. Arising from two or postl0US- three of the lower cervical transverse processes, it is inserted below, ^"uts!" by a thin tendon about half an inch wide, into the second rib in front of the serratus posticus superior. Action. It acts as an elevator of the second rib ; and its fibres Use. having the same direction as those of the medius, it will help to incline the neck in the same way. The subclavian artery (fig. 16) is the first portion of the large Subclavian trunk supplying the upper limb with blood, and is thus desig-artery nated from its position beneath the clavicle. On the right side, extends to this vessel (8) is derived from the bifurcation of the innominate um'ur Vlmh> artery behind the sterno-clavicular articulation, and the part of it named subclavian extends as far as the outer border of the first rib. To reach the limb the artery crosses the lower part of the neck, taking an arched course over the top of the lung and the first rib, F 268 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. is divided into three parts.

Position of vein; of nerves to the artery. Third part is super- ficial. Parts cover- ing it; and beneath, and between the scaleni muscles. For the purpose of describing its numerous connections the vessel is divided into three parts ; the first extending from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the inner border of the anterior scalenus ; the second, beneath the scalenus ; and the third, from the outer border of that muscle to the outer edge of the first rib. First part. Internal to the anterior scalenus the artery lies deeply in the neck, and ascends somewhat from its origin. Between the vessel and the surface will be found the common tegumentary coverings with the platysma and the deep fascia; the sterno- mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles ; and a strong deep process of fascia from the inner border of the scalenus muscle. Behind and below, it rests against the pleura, which ascends into the arch formed by the vessel; and the apex of the lung separates the artery from the vertebrae and the first and second ribs. Veins. The innominate vein lies below and rather in front of this part of the artery. The internal jugular vein crosses the arterial trunk close to the scalenus : and underneath this vein, with the same direction, lies the vertebral vein. Much more superficial, and separated from the artery by muscles, is the deep part of the anterior jugular vein. Nerves. In front of the arteiy lies the pneumo-gastric nerve, near to the internal jugular vein ; and inside this, the lower cardiac branch of the same nerve trunk. Beneath the subclavian artery winds the recurrent branch of the pneumo-gastric; and one or two branches of the sympathetic nerve form loops around the vessel. Second jwrt. Beneath the scalenus the vessel is not so deep as in the first part of its course, and at this spot it rises highest above the clavicle. It is covered by the integuments, platysma, and deep fascia ; then by the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid ; and lastly by the anterior scalenus. Behind and below the artery are the pleura and lung. Veins. Below the level of the artery, and separated from it by the anterior scalenus muscle, lies the arch of the subclavian vein. Nerves. In front of the scalenus descends the phrenic nerve. Above the vessel, in the interval between the scaleni, are placed the large cervical nerves ; and the trunk formed by the last cervical and first dorsal nerves is behind the arteiy. Tliird -part. Beyond the scalenus the artery traverses the clavicular part of the posterior triangular space (fig. 14), and is nearer the surface than in the rest of its course : this part of the vessel is enclosed in a sheath of the deep cervical fascia, which it receives as it passes from between the scaleni. It is comparatively superficial while in the space before mentioned, for it is covered only by the integuments, the platysma, and deep fascia; but near its termination the vessel gets under cover of the clavicle and sub- clavius muscle, and the suprascapular vessels cross in front of it. In this part of its course the artery rests on the surface of the first rib, which is interposed between it and the pleura ; and the inser- tion of the scalenus medius is behind it.09 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Veins. The subclavian vein approaches the artery, not being Position of separated by muscle, but lies commonly at a lower level. The vems; external jugular vein crosses it near the scalenus muscle ; and the suprascapular and transverse cervical branches, which enter the jugular, sometimes form a plexus over this part of the artery. Nerves. The large nerves of the brachial plexus are mostly above of nerves to the artery, but the lowest trunk is still behind and close to the artery- vessel; and the small nerve to the subclavius crosses it about the middle. Superficial to the cervical fascia lie the descending cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus. Peculiarities. The artery may spring as a separate trunk from Peculiarities the arch of the aorta, in which case it takes a deeper course than of onsm> usual to reach the interval between the scaleni muscles. The level of the arch formed by the subclavian artery in the neck level and varies in different subjects (see p. 56) ; and occasionally the vessel course- pierces, or even passes in front of the scalenus anticus muscle. Branches. The chief branches of the subclavian artery are four in Branches of number. Three of these arise from the first part of the arterialsubclavian- trunk :—one (vertebral) ascends to the head ; another (internal Prom first, mammary) descends to the chest; and the remaining one (thyroid axis) is a short thick trunk, which furnishes branches inwards and outwards to the thyroid body and the shoulder. These arise commonly near the scalenus muscle, so as to leave an interval at the beginning of the trunk free from offsets. This interval varies in length from half an inch to an inch in the greater number of cases ; and its extremes range from less than a quarter of an inch to an inch and three quarters. In some instances the branches are scattered over the first part of the artery.* The fourth branch (superior intercostal) arises beneath the an- second, terior scalenus from the second part of the artery, and gives off the deep cervical branch : a small spinal artery frequently comes from this part of the trunk. If there is a branch present on the third part of the artery, it is and third commonly the posterior scapular : if more than one, the internal part' mammary, the suprascapular, or the thyroid axis may be added. The vertebral artery is generally the first and largest branch of Vertebral the subclavian, and arises from the upper and posterior part of the m he trunk. Ascending between the contiguous borders of the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles, this branch enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and is continued upwards to the skull through the foramina in the other cervical vertebrae. Before the artery enters its aperture it lies behind the internal jugular vein, and is crossed by the inferior thyroid artery ; it is accompanied by branches of the sympathetic nerve, and supplies small muscular offsets. Its farther course and distribution will be Small given afterwards. branches. * The student is referred for fuller information respecting the peculiarities of the vessels, and the practical applications to be deduced from them, to the original and valuable work on the Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body by Richard Quain, F.R.S.70 DISSECTION OF THE NECK.

The vertebral vein issues with its accompanying artery, to which it is here superficial, and descends over the subclavian artery to join the innominate vein ; it receives the dee}} cervical vein, and the branch (anterior vertebral vein) that accompanies the ascending cervical artery. The internal mammary branch leaves the lower part of the sub- clavian artery, and coursing downwards beneath the clavicle, and on the outer side of the innominate vein, enters the thorax between the cartilage of the first rib and the pleura. As the artery dis- appears in the chest, it is crossed superficially by the phrenic nerve. The vessel is distributed to the walls of the chest and abdomen; and its anatomy will be learnt with the dissection of those parts. Thyroid axis. This is a short thick trunk (fig. 16) which arises from the front of the subclavian artery near the anterior scalenus muscle, and soon divides into three branches—one to the thyroid body, and two to the back of the shoulder. The suprascapular branch courses outwards across the lower part of the neck, behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle, to the superior border of the scapida, and entering the supraspinous fossa is distributed on the dorsum of that bone. The connections of this artery are more fully seen in the dissection of the back. The transverse cervical branch, usually larger than the preceding, takes a similar direction, though higher in the neck, and ends beneath the border of the trapezius muscle in the superficial cervical and posterior scapular arteries. (See the dissection of the back.) In its course outwards through the posterior triangular space, this branch crosses in front of the anterior scalenus, the phrenic nerve, and the brachial plexus, but usually behind the omo-hyoid. Some small offsets are supplied by it to the parts in the posterior triangle. In many bodies the transverse branch arising from the thyroid axis is of small size, and ends as the superficial cervical artery, while the posterior scapular branch arises separately from the third, or even the second part of the siibclavian trunk (fig. 16). The inferior thyroid, branch is the largest offset of the thyroid axis. Directed inwards with a flexuous course to the thyroid body, this branch passes beneath the common carotid artery and the accom- panying vein and nerves, and in front of the longus colli muscle and the recurrent nerve. Behind the lower part of the thyroid body it divides into branches which ramify in that organ, and communicate with the superior thyroid and its fellow. Near the larynx an inferior laryngeal branch is directed upwards with the nerve of the same name, and other offsets are furnished to the trachea and the neighbouring muscles. The ascending cervical branch of the thyroid is directed upwards between the scalenus anticus and rectus capitis anticus major, and ends in branches to those muscles and the posterior triangle of the neck. Some small spinal offsets are conveyed along the spinal nerves to the cord and its membranes. The veins corresponding with the branches of the thyroid axis have the following destination :—those with the suprascapular andSUBCLAVIAN . VEIN. 71 transverse cervical arteries open into the external jugular vein. But the inferior thyroid vein, beginning in the thyroid body, descends on the front of the trachea to the innominate vein. The superior intercostal artery arises from the posterior part of the Superior I subclavian, and arching over the apex of the lung, passes downwards ^n™!*al in front of the neck of the first rib : its distribution to the first two intercostal spaces will be seen in the thorax. Arising in common with this branch is the deep cervical artery, Deep cervi- which passes backwards between the transverse process of the last ca cervical vertebra and the first rib, lying internal to the two hinder scaleni muscles and the fleshy slips continued upwards from the erector spinse, to end beneath the complexus muscle at the posterior part of the neck. A spinal branch is frequently given from the second part of the Spinal artery; its offsets are continued into the spinal canal through the ran intervertebral foramina. The subclavian vein is much shorter than the companion artery, Subclavian reaching only from the outer edge of the first rib to the inner border vem" of the anterior scalenus. It is a continuation of the axillary vein, and ends by joining the internal jugular in the innominate trunk. Its course is arched below the level of the artery, from which it is separated by the scalenus anticus. Branches. The subclavian vein is joined at the outer edge of the Its anterior scalenus by the external jugular vein, and sometimes also t>rano es • by the anterior jugular. Into the angle of union of the subclavian and internal jugular veins the right lymphatic duct opens (fig. 28,9) ; opening of and at the like spot on the left side, the large lymphatic or thoracic JSctsmtl° duct ends (fig. 28, 8). The highest pair of valves in the subclavian Valves, trunk is placed outside the opening of the external jugular vein.* It should be borne in mind that occasionally the vein is as high Position in the neck as the third part of its companion artery ; and that it may vary' has been seen in a few instances with the artery beneath the anterior scalenus. The ANTERIOR PRIMARY BRANCHES OP THE CERVICAL NERVES Spring Cervical from the common trunks in the intervertebral foramina, and appear nerves- on the side of the neck between the intertransverse muscles. These Position and nerves are eight in number, and are equally divided between the nmuBer- cervical and brachial plexuses ; the upper four being combined in the former, and the remaining nerves in the latter plexus. Close to their origin they are joined by offsets of communication from the sympathetic cord. To this general statement some addition is needed for the first First two two nerves, the peculiarities of which are noticed in Section XVIII. bom Brachial plexus (fig. 17).

Near the outer border of the middle scalenus these three trunks bifurcate, each giving off an anterior and a posterior division. As they pass beneath the clavicle the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks join to form the outer cord of the plexus ; the posterior divisions of the three trunks by their union give rise to the posterior cord; while the large anterior division of the lower trunk is continued as the inner cord. The three cords accompany the subclavian artery, lying to its acromial side, and are continued to the axilla where the nerves of the limb arise. Branches. The branches of the plexus may be classed into those Branches above the clavicle, and those below that bone. Those of the upper set end mostly in muscles of the lower part of the neck and of the in the neck scapula; while the lower set consists of the branches to the upper aie :— limb, with which they will be described. Branches above the clavicle. Brandies for the scaleni and Nerves of 1*1 longus colli muscles. These small twigs arise from the nerves close longus* colli to the intervertebral foramina, and are seen when the anterior scalenus is divided. The branch for the rhomboid muscles springs from the fifth nerve, Nerve of and perforates the fibres of the scalenus medius ; it is directed rnomlMids. backwards beneath the levator anguli scapulas to its destination. Branches are given usually from this nerve to the levator anguli scapulas. The nerve of the serratus (posterior thoracic nerve) arises from the Nerve of fifth, sixth, and generally also the seventh, nerves near the inter- serratus- vertebral foramina. Piercing the fibres of the scalenus lower than the preceding branch, the nerve is continued downwards behind the brachial plexus, and enters the serratus magnus muscle on its axillary surface. The branch for the subclavius muscle is a slender twig, which arises Nerve of from the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth nerves, and is directed subclavius- downwards over the subclavian artery to the deep surface of the muscle ; it is often united with the phrenic nerve at the lower part of the neck.

Each nerve entering the plexus, except the first, divides into an ascending and Arrange- a descending branch, and these unite with corresponding parts of mentof thc the adjacent nerves, so as to give rise to a series of arches. From nerves' these arches or loops the different branches arise:—DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Its offsets are super- ficial ; and deep, ■which are: Phrenic nerve. Nerves to join descen- dens noni.

Those of the superficial set are again subdivided into ascending and descending, and have been described with the posterior triangular space of the neck (p. 56). The ascending branches may be now seen to spring from the union of the second and third nerves ; and the descending, to take origin from the loop between the third and fourth nerves. The deep set of branches remains to be examined: they are muscular and communicating, and may be arranged in an internal and an external series. Internal series. The phrenic or muscular nerve of the dia- phragm (fig. 16) is derived from the fourth, or third and fourth nerves of the plexus; and it may be joined by a fasciculus from the fifth cervical nerve. Descending obliquely on the surface of the anterior scalenus from the outer to the inner edge, it enters the chest in front of the internal mammary artery, but behind the sub- clavian vein, and traverses that cavity to reach the diaphragm. At the lower part of the neck the phrenic nerve is joined by a filament of the sympathetic, and sometimes by an offset of the nerve to the subclavius muscle. On the left side the nerve crosses over the first part of the sub* clavian arteiy. The branches communicating xoith the descendens noni are two in number. One arises from the second, and the other from the third cervical nerve ; they are directed inwards over or under the internal jugular vein to join the descending muscular branch (descendens noni) of the hypoglossal nerve in front of the common carotid artery. Muscular branches are furnished to the anterior recti muscles ; they arise from the loop between the first two nerves, and from the trunks of the other nerves close to the intervertebral foramina. Some connecting branches pass from the loop between the first two nerves to the vagus, hypoglossal and sympathetic nerves near the skull: these will be afterwards seen. External series. Muscular branches are supplied from the second nerve to the sterno-mastoid; from the third and fourth nerves to the levator anguli scapulas and middle scalenus; and from the loop between the same nerves to the trapezius. Connecting branches with the spinal accessory nerve exist in three places. First, in the sterno-mastoid muscle ; next, in the posterior triangular space ; and lastly, beneath the trapezius. The union with the branches distributed to the trapezius has the appearance of a plexus. The common carotid artery is the chief vessel for the supply of blood to the neck and head (fig. 16, 6). The origin of the vessel differs on the two sides, beiDg at the lower part of the neck on the right side, and in the thorax on the left side. The right vessel commences opposite the stemo-clavicular articu- lation at the bifurcation of the innominate artery, and ends at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage by dividing into external and internal carotids. .The course of the artery is along the side of theCOMMON CAEOTID AETEKY. 7r, trachea and larynx, gradually diverging from the vessel on the opposite side in consequence of the increasing size of the larynx; and its position will he marked hy a line from the stern o-clavicular Situation. articidation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. Contained in a sheath of cervical fascia with the internal jugular vein and the pneunio-gastric nerve, the carotid artery has the follow- ing connections with the surrounding parts :—As high as the cricoid Parts cover- cartilage the vessel is deeply placed, and is concealed by the common m^1 ' coverings of the skin, platysma, and fasciae ; and hy the muscles at the lower part of the neck, viz., sterno-mastoid (sternal origin), sterno-hyoid, omo-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid. But from the cricoid cartilage to its termination the artery is more superficial, being covered only by the sterno-mastoid with the common investments of the neck. The vessel rests mostly on the longus colli and scalenus beneath it, anticus muscles, but close to its ending on the rectus capitis anticus major. To the inner side of the carotid lie the trachea and larynx, and on its the oesophagus and pharynx, and the thyroid body, the last over-sides' lapping the vessel by the side of the larynx. Along the outer side of the carotid sheath is a chain of lymphatic glands. Veins. The large internal jugular vein lies on the outer side of Position of - the artery, being closely applied to it in the upper part of its course, vems' but separated from it below by an interval about half an inch wide : on the left side the vein is nearer to the artery below, as will be afterwards seen. One or two superior thyroid veins cross the upper end of the arterial trunk; and opposite the thyroid body another small vein (middle thyroid) is directed backwards over the vessel. Near the clavicle the anterior jugular vein passes outwards in front of the artery, but is separated from it by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. Arteries. Offsets of the superior thyroid artery descend over the of arteries, upper part of the sheath ; and the inferior thyroid crosses behind it near the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. Nerves. The descendens noni lies in front of the artery, crossing of nerves to from the outer to the inner side, and is joined there by the com- carotid- mivnicating branches from the cervical plexus. The pnemno-gastric lies within the sheath, behind and between the artery and the vein. The sympathetic cord and branches rest on the spine behind the sheath. All the nerves above mentioned have a longitudinal direc- tion ; but the inferior laryngeal or recurrent crosses obliquely inwards beneath the sheath, towards the lower end of the artery. Branches of carotid. As a rule, the common carotid artery does Branehes not furnish any collateral branch, though it is very common for the none' superior thyroid to spring from its upper end. At the terminal bifurcation into the two carotids the artery is slightly bulged. The internal jugdlar veln extends upwards to the base of the Internal skull, but only the part of it that accompanies the common carotid ->usular vohl artery is now seen. Placed on the outer side of the artery, the vein ends below by uniting with the subclavian to form the innominate trunk. . .

Near its ending it becomes contracted, and is provided with a single or double valve. In this part of its course the vein receives the superior and middle thyroid branches. Peculiarities of the carotid. The origin of the artery on the riglit side may be above or below the point stated. Mention has been made of the difference in the place of bifurcation, and of the fact that the common carotid may not be divided into two (p. 62). As a veiy rare occurrence, 'instead of one there may be two trunks issuing from beneath the lryoid muscles. Dissection. The dissector may next trace out completely the trunk of the external carotid (fig. 18), and follow its branches until they disappear beneath different parts. Afterwards he may separate from one another the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, which cross the carotid, and define their origin and insertion. The digastric muscle (fig. 16, b) consists of two fleshy bellies, united by an intervening tendon. The posterior, the larger of the two, arises from the digastric fossa on the inner side of the mastoid process ; while the anterior belly is fixed to the depression by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw. From these attachments the fibres are directed to the intervening tendon, which is sur- rounded by fibres of the stylo-hyoid, and is united by an aponeurotic expansion to its fellow, and to the body and part of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. The arch formed by the digastric is superficial, except at the posterior end, where it is beneath the sterno-mastoid and splenius muscles. The posterior belly covers the carotid vessels and the accompanying veins and nerves ; and is placed across the anterior triangular space of the neck in the position of a line from the mastoid process to the fore part of the hyoid bone. Along its lower border lie the occipital artery and the hypoglossal nerve, the former passing backwards, the latter forwards. The anterior belly rests on the mylo-hyoid muscle. The muscle forms the lower boundary of a space between it, the jaw, and the base of the skull, which is subdivided into two by the stylo-maxillary ligament. In the posterior portion are contained the parotid gland (10), and the vessels and nerves in connection with it (p. 29); in the anterior, are the submaxillary gland (u), with the facial and submental vessels, and deeper still, the muscles between the chin and the hyoid bone. Action. The lower jaw being moveable, the muscle depresses that bone and opens the mouth. If the jaw is fixed, the two bellies acting will elevate the hyoid bone. The stylohyoid muscle is thin and slender, and lies imme- diately above the posterior belly of the digastric. It arises fromEXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. the posterior surface of the styloid process near the base, and inserted into the outer part of the body of the hyoid bone. The muscle has the same relations as the posterior belly the digastric ; and its fleshy fibres are usually perforated by tt tendon of that muscle. In some bodies the stylo-hyoid is absent. Action. This muscle elevates the hyoid bone in swallowing, and Use. with the posterior belly of the digastric, prevents the bone being carried forwards by the other elevators. The hypoglossal nerve (twelfth cranial) arjpears in the anterior ^elfth triangle at the lower edge of the digastric muscle, where it hooks anterior round the occipital artery; it is then directed forwards to the triangle. tongue beneath the tendon of that muscle, and disappears in front under the mylo-hyoid. In this course the nerve passes over the two carotids ; and near the great cornu of the hyoid bone it also crosses the lingual artery. From this part arise the descending Branches: branch, and a small muscular offset to the thyro-hyoid. The descendinq branch (ram. descendens noni) leaves the trunk one to hyoid muscles of the hypoglossal as it turns round the occipital artery, and descends on the front of, or more frequently within, the carotid sheath to below the middle of the neck, where it is joined by the is joined communicating branches of the cervical nerves so as to form a single cai nerves, or double loop (ansa hypoc/lossi) with the concavity turned upwards. The descending branch gives an offset to the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and from the loop branches proceed to the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, to the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles : sometimes another offset is continued to the thorax, where it joins the phrenic and cardiac nerves. The EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY (fig. 18, d) Springs from the External bifurcation of the common carotid at the upper border of the ^ery! thyroid cartilage, and furnishes branches to the neck, the face, and the outer part of the head. From the place of origin it ascends in front of the mastoid pro- Extent, cess, and ends opposite the neck of the lower jaw in the internal maxillary and temporal branches. The artery lies at first in front Course and of the internal carotid, but it afterwards inclines somewhat back- directlon- wards and becomes superficial to that vessel. Its position would be marked with sufficient accuracy by a line from the front of the meatus of the ear to the cricoid cartilage. At first the external carotid is overlaid by the sterno-mastoid, Parts roper- and by the common coverings of the anterior triangular space, viz., flcialtoit> the skin, and the superficial and deep fasciae with the platysma. But above the level of a line from the mastoid process to the hyoid bone, the artery is crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles ; and higher stdl it is concealed by the parotid gland. At its beginning the artery rests against the pharynx ; but above the angle of the beneath it, jaw it is placed over the styloid process and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, which separate it from the internal carotid. In front of the and in front, upper part of the vessel are the ramus of the jaw and the stylo- maxillary Ugament. Veins.

The anterior set comprises branches to the thyroid body, the tongue, and the face, viz., superior thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries. In the posterior posterior, set are the occipital and posterior auricular brandies. And the and ascend- ascending set includes the ascending pharyngeal, temporal, and lug: internal rnaxillary arteries. Besides these, the external carotid gives other branches to the neighbouring muscles and the parotid gland. The arrangement of the branches of the carotid may be altered by change in their closer aggregation on the trunk. The usual number may be diminished by two or more uniting into one ; or it may be in- number creased by some of the secondary "offsets being transferred to the parent trunk. Directions. All the branches, except the ascending pharyngeal, Branches lingual and internal maxillary, may be now examined ; but those "re—Se6U three will be described afterwards with the regions they occupy. The superior thyroid artery (e) arises near the great cornu of the Superior hyoid bone, and passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid and thyi0ld stemo-thyroid muscles to the thyroid body, to which it is dis- tributed on the anterior aspect. This artery is superficial in the ,ias these anterior triangle, and furnishes offsets to the lowest constrictor and the muscles beneath which it lies, in addition to the following named branches :— a. The hyoid branch is very small, and runs inwards below the b1^nhy:oid hyoid bone : it supplies the muscles attached to that bone, and ' anastomoses with the vessel of the opposite side. b. A sterno-mctstoid branch descends in front of the sheath of the to sterno- common carotid artery, and is distributed chiefly to the muscle from muscle which it takes its name. c. The superior laryngeal artery pierces the membrane between the to larynx, hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage, with the superior laryngeal nerve, and ends in the interior of the larynx. d. A small crico-thyroid branch is placed on the membrane be- to crico- tween the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and communicates with the Membrane, corresponding artery of the opposite side, forming an arch. The superior thyroid vein commences in the larynx and the thyroid Accompany- body, and crosses the end of the common carotid artery to open into ing vein- the internal jugular vein. The facial artery (g) arises above the lingual, and is directed Facial upwards over the lower jaw to the face. In the neck the artery artery passes under the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and then beneath the submaxillary gland, under cover of which it makes a sigmoid turn. Its anatomy in the face has been referred to (p. 27). From supplies the cervical part branches are given to the pharynx, and to the structures below the jaw, viz. :— a. The inferior or ascending palatine branch ascends to the pharynx to the beneath the jaw, passing between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyn- pa,ate gens muscles, and is distributed to the soft palate, which' it reaches by turning over the upper border of the superior constrictor muscle. Its place in the palate is frequently supplied by an offset of the ascending pharyngeal artery.DISSECTION OF THE NECK. so tonsil, submaxil- lary gland, and mylo- hyoid muscle. Facial vein. Occipital artery- ends on occiput; a sterno- mastoid branch; sometimes a posterior meningeal. b. The tonsillar branch is smaller than the preceding, and passes between the internal pterygoid and styloglossus muscles. Opposite the tonsil it perforates the constrictor muscle, and ends in offsets to that body. c. Glandular branches are supplied to the submaxillary gland from the part of the artery in contact with it. d. The submental branch arises near the inferior maxilla, and courses forwards on the mylo-hyoid muscle to the anterior belly of the digastric, where it ends in offsets : some of these turn over the jaw to the chin and lower lip ; and the rest supply the muscles between the jaw and the hyoid bone, one or two perforating the mylo-hyoid and anastomosing with the sublingual artery. The facial vein (p. 27) joins the internal jugular. In the cervical part of its course it receives branches corresponding to the offsets of the artery; and it frequently sends a considerable branch downwards to join the anterior jugular vein (p. 63). The occipital artery springs from the carotid opposite the facial branch, near the lower border of the digastric muscle, and ascends to the inner side of the mastoid process. Here it turns backwards in the occipital grove of the temporal bone, passing above the trans- verse process of the atlas, and then runs between the muscles attached to the occipital bone, to become cutaneous and ramify over the back of the head (p. 6). In the part of its course now exposed the artery lies beneath the digastric muscle and the parotid gland, and crosses over the internal carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves. The occipital artery gives small branches to the surrounding muscles, and one larger branch to the sterno-mastoid, which bends downwards over the hypoglossal and enters the muscle in company with the spinal accessory nerve: this branch frequently arises directly from the external carotid. In some bodies there is also a small meningeal branch entering the skull by the jugular foramen. The offsets at the back of the neck are seen in the dissection of that Occipital veins.

The posterior auricular artery is smaller than the preceding branch, and takes origin above the digastric muscle. Between the ear and the mastoid process, it divides into two branches for the ear and occiput (p. 6). A small branch, stylo-mastoid, enters the foramen of the same name, and suppbes the middle ear. The posterior auricular vein is of considerable size, and descends over the upper end of the sterno-mastoid muscle to join the beginning of the external jugular.

In this region are included the muscles superficial to and beneath Contents of the ramus of the lower jaw, together with the temporo-maxillary tho ruK'°"- articulation. In contact with the muscles (pterygoid) beneath the jaw, are the internal maxillary blood-vessels, and the inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve. Direction. The masseter muscle, which is superficial to the Dissection, bone, has been partly laid bare in the dissection of the facial nerve.

It is inserted into the outer surface of the coronoid process and ramus of the lower jaw, extending from the angle behind to the level of the second molar tooth in front. The superficial fibres are inclined downwards and backwards, and form a layer that can be readily separated from the deeper portion of the muscle, in which the fibres run nearly vertically. The lower part of the masseter is covered only by the integu- ments, with the platysma and fascia ; but the upper is partly con- cealed by the parotid gland, and is crossed by Stenson's duct, and by the transverse facial vessels and branches of the facial nerve. The anterior border projects over the buccinator muscle, and a quantity of loose fat resembling that in the orbit is found beneath it. The muscle covers the ramus of the jaw, and the masseteric branches of nerve and artery entering its deep surface. Action. It raises the lower jaw with the internal pterygoid in the mastication of the food. Dissection. To lay bare the temporal muscle to its insertion, the following dissection may be made :—The temporal fascia is to be detached from the upper border of the zygomatic arch and removed from the surface of the muscle. Next, the arch is to be sawn through in front and behind, so as to include all its length ; and is to be thrown down (without being cut off) with the masseter still attached to it, by separating the fibres of that muscle from the ramus of the jaw. In detaching the masseter its nerve and vessels, which pass through the sigmoid notch, will come into view, and should be dissected out of the muscle. The surface of the temporal muscle may be then cleaned. And to expose its termination, let the coronoid process be sawn off by a cut passing from the centre of the sigmoid notch to the last molar tooth, so as to include the whole insertion of the muscle. Before sawing the bone let the student find and separate from the muscle the buccal vessels and nerve issuing from beneath it. Lastly, the coronoid process should be raised and the fat removed, in order that the lower fibres of the temporal muscle, and their contiguity to the external pterygoid beneath them, may be seen. The temporal muscle (fig. 19,:) arises from the fascia covering it, and from the bones forming the temporal fossa (p. 4), reaching upwards to the semicircular line on the side of the skull, and down- wards to the infratemporal crest on the great wing of the sphenoid bone. From this extensive origin the fibres converge to a tendon, which appears on the outer surface of the muscle, and is inserted into the borders and inner surface of the coronoid process, as well as into a groove on the front of the ramus of the lower jaw, extending down- wards nearly to the last molar tooth. Behind the posterior border of the tendon are the masseteric vessels and nerve, and in front of it the buccal vessels and nerve : the last nerve occasionally perforates some of the fibres of the muscle. Action. All the fibres contracting, the muscle will raise theREMOVAL OP PART OF JAW. 83, mandible and press it forcibly against the upper jaw.

For the display of the pterygoid muscles (ng. 19), pterygoid it will be necessary to remove a piece of the ramus of the jaw. muscles, But the greater part of the temporal muscle is to be first de- tached from the subjacent bone with the handle of the scalpel, and the deep temporal vessels and nerves are to be sought in its fibres.

After the loose piece of bone has been removed, and the sub- Jj^e jt^awjiy jacent parts freed from much fat, the pterygoid muscles will appear,—the external (2) being directed backwards and outwards to the condyle, while the internal (3), which is parallel in direction to the rnasseter, descends to the angle of the jaw. In removing the fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin internal lateral ligament, which lies on the internal pterygoid muscle beneath the ramus. * Superficial view of the pterygoid region (Quain's "Arteries"). 1.

Internal maxillary artery (bcneatb the pterygoid instead of over it).—The nerves are omitted in this woodcut. o 2DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. Position of vessels. Running forwards over the external pterygoid muscle is the internal maxillary artery, which distributes offsets upwards and downwards : sometimes the artery is placed beneath the muscle. The veins, which form a large plexus between the muscles, may be taken away. Position of nerves. Most of the branches of the inferior maxillary nerve are seen in this dissection. Thus, the masseteric and deep temporal nerves appear between the upper border of the external pterygoid and the skull, while the buccal nerve perforates the fore part of the muscle. Issuing from beneath the lower border of the same muscle are the large inferior dental and lingual nerves, the latter being the anterior of the two ; and coming out behind the condyle of the jaw is the auriculo-temporal nerve. The small posterior dental branch of the superior maxillary nerve is also to be found, lying with the artery of the same name on the hinder part of the upper jaw. The external PTERYGOID muscle (fig. 19,2) is triangular in shape, and arises by two heads, which are separated hy an interval opposite the spheno-maxillary fossa. The upper head is the smaller, and is attached to the fore part of the zygomatic surface of the great wing of the sphenoid bone ; the lower head springs from the outer sur- face of the external pterygoid plate. From this origin the muscle runs backwards and outwards to be inserted into the hollow in front of the neck of the lower jaw-bone, and into the interarticular fibro- cartilage of the joint. Externally the pterygoid is concealed by the temporal muscle and the lower jaw ; and the internal maxillary artery usually lies on it. Its deep surface is in coutact with the internal pterygoid, the inferior maxillary nerve, and with the internal lateral ligament of the jaw. Through the interval between the head? pass the buccal nerve and the internal maxillary artery, when the latter is placed beneath the muscle. The parts in contact with the borders nl' ilie external pterygoid have been enumerated above. Action. If both muscles contract, the jaw is moved directly for- wards, so that the lower dental arch is placed in front of the upper ; but if one muscle act alone (say the right), the condyle of the same side is drawn forwards, and the grinding teeth of the. lower jaw are moved obliquely to the left across those of the upper. By the alternate action of the two muscles the trituration of the food ia mainly effected. The internal pterygoid MDSCLE (fig. 19, 3) crosses the direc- tion of the external, and is nearly parallel to the ramus of the jaw. It arises in the pterygoid fossa, mainly from the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate, and by a small slip from the outer surface of the tuberosity of the palate bone and the superior maxilla in front of the pterygoid process. The fibres descend to be inserted into a rough mark on the inner side of the ramus of the lower jaw, extending from the inferior dental foramen to the angle. On the muscle are placed the dental and lingual nerves, the dental veseels, and the internal lateral ligament of the jaw. Its deep85 TEMP0R0-MAXILLA11Y ARTICULATION. surface is in relation with the superior constrictor below, and the tensor palati above.

This Joint of^ articulation is a compound joint, being formed by the condyle of the owerJaw- lower jaw and the fore part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, with an interposed disc of fibro-cartilage. The bones are united by the following ligaments :— The capsule is a thin membranous tube which is attached above Capsular to the temporal bone around the articular surface, and below to the iejf"n ' condyle of the lower jaw, reaching farther down behind than in front. The cavity in the interior is divided into two parts, upper Fig. 20.* Fig. 21.f and lower, by the fibro-cartilage ; and the upper portion of the capsule is wider and looser than the lower. The external lateral ligament is a thickened band of the capsule, External composed of fibres passing from the tubercle at the root of the latera1' zygoma and the adjoining part of the outer surface of that process to the outer and posterior part of the neck of the lower jaw. The internal lateral ligament (fig. 20, *) is a long, thin, mem- and internal branous band, which is not in contact with the joint. Superiorly it ^^lliga" is connected to a ridge on the inner side of the glenoid fossa, formed by the spinous process of the sphenoid and the vaginal process of the temporal bone ; and inferiorly it is inserted into the inner margin of the dental foramen in the lower jaw. The ligament lies between the jaw and the internal pterygoid ; and its origin is con- cealed by the external pterygoid muscle. The internal maxillary vessels, with the auriculo-temporal and inferior dental nerves, pass between the band and the ramus of the jaw. Dissection.

The interarticular fibro-cartilage (fig. 21, 4) is an oval plate, elongated transversely, and thinner in the centre, where it is some- times perforated, than at the margins. The upper surface fits the articular hollow and eminence of the temporal bone, being convex behind and concave in front; and the lower is moulded to the convexity of the condyle of the jaw. By the circumference it is connected with the capsule ; and in front the external pterygoid muscle is attached to it. This interarticular disc allows a double movement to take place in the articulation, the condyle of the jaw revolving in the socket formed by the fibro-cartilage, while the latter glides forwards and backwards over the temporal articular surface. Two synovial sacs are present in the articulation—a larger one above, and a smaller one below the fibro-cartilage. Another structure—the stylo-maxillary ligament (fig. 21, 3) is described as a uniting band to the articulation. This is a process of the deep cervical fascia, which extends from the styloid process to the hinder border of the ramus of the jaw ; it gives attachment to the stylo-glossus muscle, and separates the parotid and submaxillary glands. Articular surfaces of the bones. The condyle of the jaw has a form resembling that of a part of a cylinder, with its axis directed obliquely from without inwards and somewhat backwards. The upper articular surface is placed on the squamous part of the temporal bone, and is larger than that on the jaw. It includes the deep oval hollow formed by the part of the glenoid fossa in front of the Glaserian fissure, and the convex surface, known as the articular eminence, which forms the anterior boundary of the hollow. Movements of the joint. The lower jaw has up and down, forward and backward, and oblique movements. In depressing the jaw, as in opening the mouth, the condyle moves forwards till it is placed under the convexity of the articular eminence ; but the interposed concave fibro-cartilage gives security to the joint. Even with this provision, a slight degree more of sudden motion may throw the condyle off the prominence of the temporal bone into the zygomatic fossa, and give rise to dislocation. In this movement the fore and lateral parts of the capsule are tightened; and the fibro-cartilage is drawn forwards with the condyle by the external pterygoid muscle. When the jaw is elevated and the mouth closed, the condyle and the fibro-cartilage glide back into the glenoid fossa ; and the posterior part of the capsule is stretched. During the horizontal movements fonvards and backwards of the jaw the condyle is placed successively opposite the front and back of the temporal articular surface ; and the fibro-cartilage always follows the condyle of the jaw, even in dislocation. Excessive motion forwards would be prevented by the coronoid process of the jaw striking against the zygomatic arch ; and the87 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. backward movement is checked by the external lateral ligament and by the meeting of the condyle with the postglenoid process of the temporal bone. The oblique movement is produced by the condyle of one side Oblique advancing on the articular eminence, while the other remains in the ho0™^"1* glenoid fossa. If the right condyle advances, the chin moves to the duced. left side, and the grinding teeth of the lower jaw are carried obliquely to the left and forwards across the upper set.

The condyle of the jaw is next to be disarticulated ^j^jJJJ) and drawn forwards with the attached external pterygoid muscle, so maxillary as to allow the inferior maxillary nerve to be seen (fig. 22). While "erve< cutting through the joint-capsule, the dissector must be careful of the auriculo-temporal nerve close beneath. On turning forwards the pterygoid muscle, and removing some its trunk fat, the dissector will find the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve. The masseteric, temporal, and buccal branches of the nerve should and be traced to a common origin close below the foramen ovale of the branolies '< sphenoid bone. The dental and lingual nerves should be cleaned beneath the muscle ; and the auriculo-temporal nerve followed for- wards with care from the back of the articulation to its origin from the trunk. The small chorda tympani is to be found joining the of chorda back of the lingual nerve near the skull. tympani, The large meningeal artery and its offsets are to be sought beneath and arteries, the external pterygoid. Sometimes the trunk of the internal maxillary artery lies beneath that muscle, and in that case, it and its branches are now to be cleaned. The internal maxillary artery (fig. 19, 8) is one of the ter- Internal minal branches of the external carotid, and takes a winding course ™eryaiy beneath the lower jaw and the temporal muscle to the spheno- maxillary fossa, where it ends in branches for the face, the interior of the nose, and the palate and pharynx. At first the artery is directed forwards between the ramus of the course and jaw and the internal lateral ligament of the joint, and crosses the rektions' dental nerve; it then ascends over the lower portion of the external pterygoid, being placed between it and the temporal muscle j and finally, it turns inwards opposite the interval between the heads of the external pterygoid to gain the spheno-maxillary fossa. The course of the artery is sometimes beneath, instead of over the exter- varies in its nal pterygoid ; and when that is the case, the artery reaches the l'ositiou- spheno-maxillary fossa by passing between the heads of the muscle, as in the figure. The branches of this artery are numerous, and are classed in three Branches sets : the first set arises beneath the jaw ; the second between the *Hj*three muscles ; and the third in the spheno-maxillary fossa. Two chief branches, viz., the inferior dental and the great Those be- meningeal, leave the internal maxillary artery while it is in contact neathjaw- with the ramus of the jaw. The inferior dental artery descends between the internal lateral Inferior ligament and the jaw, and enters the foramen on the inner surface dentalDISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. 88 has a branch to mylohyoid muscle. Great meningeal artery ends in skull, but gives branch to tympanum, to meatus, to dura mater. Branch with lingual nerve. Branches of second part are— to the temporal muscle : to the masseter; to the cheek ; to pterygoid muscles. Branches of third part: of the ramus, along with the dental nerve ; it supplies the teeth, and ends in the lower part of the face (p. 91). As the artery is ahout to enter the foramen it furnishes a small mylo-hyoid branch to the muscle of that name ; this is conducted by a groove on the inner surface of the bone, in company with a branch from the dental nerve, to the superficial surface of its muscle, where it anastomoses with the submental artery. The great meningeal artery is the largest branch of the internal maxillary, and arises opposite the preceding. It ascends beneath the external pterygoid muscle, and between the roots of the auriculo- temporal nerve to the foramen Bpinosum of the sphenoid bone, through which it passes into the skull. Its course and distribution within the cranial cavity have been already seen (p. 15). Before the artery reaches the foramen, it usually furnishes the following small branches; but one or more of them may arise directly from the internal maxillary trunk :— a. The tympanic branch passes into the tympanum through the Glaserian fissure, and is distributed to the tympanic membrane and parts within the cavity. b. A deep auricular branch arises with the former or separately, enters the" meatus through the cartilage, or between this and the bone, and ramifies in the meatus and on the tympanic membrane. c. The small meningeal branch begins near the skull, and courses through the foramen ovale with the inferior rnaxillary nerve ; it ramifies in the dura mater in the middle fossa of the skull. Another small branch springs from the dental artery or the internal maxillary trunk, and accompanying the lingual nerve, ends in the cheek and the mucous membrane of the mouth. The branches from the second part of the artery (between the temporal and external pterygoid) are distributed to the temporal, masseter, buccinator, and pterygoid muscles. The deep temporal arteries are two in number, anterior and pos- terior, and ascend on the side of the skull beneath the temporal muscle. The posterior anastomoses with the middle temporal branch of the superficial temporal artery; the anterior communi- cates, through the malar bone, with branches of the lachrymal artery (p. 45). The masseteric artery is directed outwards with the nerve of the same name behind the tendon of the temporal muscle, and passing through the sigmoid notch, enters the deep surface of the masseter muscle. Its branches anastomose with the other offsets to the muscle from the external carotid trunk. The buccal branch quits the artery near the upper jaw, and descends beneath the insertion of the temporal muscle with its com- panion nerve : it is distributed to the buccinator muscle and other structures of the cheek, joining branches of the facial artery. The pterygoid branches are uncertain in their position and number; whether derived from the trunk or some of the branches of the internal maxillary, they enter the two pterygoid muscles. Of the branches that arise from the artery in the spheno-maxillaryINFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. S9 fossa, only one, the posterior dental, will be now described. The only one remainder will be examined with the superior maxillary nerve and now seeu Meckel's ganglion ; they are infraorbital (p. 101), superior palatine, naso-palatine, vidian, and pterygopalatine (Section XIV). The posterior dented branch arises as the artery enters the spheno- posterior maxillary fossa, and descends with a tortuous course on thedentttl- zygomatic surface of the upper jaw, along with a small branch of the superior maxillary nerve. Its branches mostly enter the canals of the bone and supply the upper molar and bicuspid teeth, as well as the lining membrane of the antrum; but some external onsets are furnished to the gum. The INTERNAL MAXILLARY VETN is a short trunk, often double, which Internal leaves the hinder part of the pterygoid plexus, and runs backwards "etu'arises beneath the jaw with the first part of the internal maxillary artery, from to join the temporal vein in the parotid gland. The pterygoid plexus is an extensive network of veins surrounding pterygoid the internal maxillary artery and the pterygoid muscles. Into itljlexus • the veins corresponding to the branches of the artery empty them- selves, and it communicates with the cavernous sinus in the interior tributaries of the skull through the foramen ovale and foramen lacerum. From the plexus the large internal maxillary vein leads backwards, and another considerable branch, the anterior internal maxillary or and outlets deep facial vein, descends to the face to join the facial vein. A prolongation of the plexus into the spheno-maxillary fossa is often distinguished as the alveolar plexus. The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE (fig. 22) is the largest of the Inferior three trunks arising from the Gasserian ganglion (p. 18). It leaves ™ery'ellaiy the skull by the foramen ovale in the sphenoid bone, and divides immediately below that opening into two principal pieces, viz., an anterior smaller part, which is distributed mainly to muscles, and a larger posterior part, ending in branches which are, with one exception, altogether sensory. In addition to these, the nerve ol the internal pterygoid muscle arises from the inner side of the primary trunk. Directions. Should the internal maxillary artery obstruct the view of the nerve, it may be cut through. The smaller part receives nearly all the fibres of the motor Anterior root of the nerve, and furnishes branches to three of the muscles of paH the jaw, viz., temporal, masseter, and external pterygoid, and the buccal branch to the cheek. The deep temporal branches (3) are three in number, aud enter the supplies deep surface of the temporal muscle; the middle, which is the brScs largest and supplies the greater part of the muscle, leaves the middlc anterior division of the trunk and ascends close to the bone, above the upper border of the external pterygoid ; the posterior is usually posterior, conjoined with the masseteric nerve, and enters the hinder part of the muscle ; and the anterior is given off from the buccal nerve in and front of the external pterygoid. anterior.

As this branch passes by the articula- tion of the jaw it gives one or more twigs to that joint. The nerve to the external 'pterygoid generally arises in common with the buccal nerve, and enters the deep surface of its muscle : it is often represented by two or three branches. The buccal branch ('), longer and larger than the others, is mainly a sensory nerve to the cheek. It is first directed forwards between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and then descends beneath the coronoid process and insertion of the temporal muscle towards the angle of the mouth.

The larger part of the inferior maxillary nerve divides into three branches—auriculo-temporal, inferior dental, and lingual. A few of the fibres of the motor root join the dental nerve, and are conveyed to the mylo-hyoid and digastric muscles. The auriculotemporal nerve (4) arises from the trunk near the base, of the skull, usually by two roots which embrace the middle meningeal artery. In its course to the surface of the head, it is first directed backwards beneath the external pterygoid muscle * Deep view of the pterygoid region (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: A.

The inferior dental (7) is the largest of the branches of the £*™j0r inferior maxillary nerve. In its course to the canal in the lower jaw, the dental nerve is placed behind and external to the lingual, is between and lies at first beneath the external pterygoid muscle ; it after- ^^fe°ld wards rests on the internal pterygoid, and near the dental foramen on the internal lateral ligament. After the nerve enters the bone, it is continued forwards beneath the teeth to the foramen in the then in the side of the jaw, and ends at that spot by dividing into an incisorJaw' and a mental branch. Only one offset (to the mylo-hyoid muscle) leaves the dental nerve before it enters the bone. Its branches and supplies are : — a. The mylo-hyoid nerve arises near the dental foramen, and is branch continued along a groove on the inner aspect of the ramus of the hyoTd,10" jaw to the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoid, and to the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. b. The dental branches arise in the bone, and supply the molar dental and bicuspid teeth. If the bone is soft, the canal containing the g^nn$ng to nerve may be laid open so as to expose these branches. c. The incisor branch is small and continues the direction of the and cutting nerve onwards to the middle line, furnishing offsets to the canine teeth' and incisor teeth, below which it lies. d. The mental or labial branch (fig. 9, 13) is in size the continua- branch to tion of the dental trunk, and issues on the face beneath the depressor lower Up- of the angle of the mouth. It gives one offset downwards to the integument of the chin ; but the greater part of the nerve is directed upwards beneath the depressor labii inferioris, to be distributed on the inner and outer surfaces of the lower lip.

The incisor branch is continued to the symphysis of the jaw, where it ends in the bone ; it furnishes twigs to the canine and incisor teeth. The mental branch, issuing by the mental foramen, ramifies in the structures covering the lower jaw, and anastomoses with the branches of the facial artery. The lingual or gustatory nerve (8) is concealed at first, like the others, by the external pterygoid muscle. It is then inclined forwards with a small artery over the internal pterygoid, and under cover of the side of the jaw to the tongue. The remainder of the nerve will be seen in the dissection of the submaxillary region (p. 97). In its course beneath the jaw the nerve does not give off any branches, but the following communicating nerve is received by it. The chorda tympani (c) is a branch of the facial nerve, and leaves the tympanum by a special aperture close to the inner end of the (ilaserian fissure. Appearing from beneath the upper attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the jaw, this small nerve joins the lingual at an acute angle, about three-quarters of an inch below the skull. At the point of meeting a communication takes place with the lingual, but the greater part of the chorda tympani i* merely conducted along that nerve to the tongue. The origin of this nerve, and its course across the tympanum, are described in Section XIV. The nerve to the internal pterygoid can now be seen as it passes beneath the hinder border to the inner surface of its muscle, but it will be more fully shown in the dissection of the otic ganglion (Section XIV). Section VII. SUBMAXILLARY REGION. Parts in it. The submaxillary region is situate between the lower jaw and the hyoid bone.

In structure the submaxillary resembles the parotid gland (p. 29); structure, and its duct—duct of Wharton—issuing from the deep process, extends beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle to the mouth. Dissection, To see the mylo-hyoid muscle, detach the anterior Dissection belly of the digastric from the jaw, and dislodge without injury the submaxillary gland from beneath the bone. The mylo-hyoid muscle is triangular in shape, with the base at Mylo-hyoid the jaw and the apex at the hyoid bone, and unites along the middle line with its fellow of the opposite side. It arises from the Fises f'1'0"1 mylo-hyoid ridge on the inner surface of the lower jaw as far back Jaw as the last molar tooth ; and its fibres are inserted partly into the !II^rjjedlid front of the body of the hyoid bone, but the greater number end, i,one and with those of the muscle of the opposite side, in a median raphe' raP'16- between that bone and the jaw. On the cutaneous surface lie the anterior belly of the digastric it and the submaxillary gland, the facial artery with its submental offset, and the mylo-hyoid nerve and artery. The fibres of the muscle are frequently deficient near the jaw, and allow the genio- hyoid to be seen. Only the posterior border is unattached, and round it a piece of the submaxillary gland winds. The parts in contact with the deep surface of the muscle will be shown after the undermentioned dissection has been made. Action. The mylo-hyoid assists the digastric and genio-hyoid in Use. depressing the lower jaw or elevating the hyoid bone ; but its principal action is to raise the floor of the mouth and press the tongue against the palate, as in the first stage of deglutition. Dissection. To bring into view the muscles beneath the mylo- Dissection hyoid, and to trace the vessels and nerves to the substance of the mylo-hyoid. tongue, the student should first divide the facial vessels on the jaw, and remove them with the superficial part of the submaxillary gland; but he should be careful to leave the deep part of the gland which turns beneath the mylo-hyoid, because the small submaxillary ganglion is in contact with it. Next he should cut through the small branches of vessels and nerve on the surface of the mylo- hyoid ; and detaching that muscle from the jaw, should turn it down (as in fig. 24), but without injuring the genio-hyoid muscle beneath it. Afterwards the bone is to be sawn through on the right of, but To see deep close to the muscles attached to the symphysis, the soft parts theTnw*S™ covering the jaw having been first cut. The loose side of the jaw (for the ramus of the bone has been sawn before) is to be raised to see the parts beneath, and it may be fastened up with a stitch ; but it should not be detached from the mucous membrane of the mouth.DISSECTION OF THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 94 fasten tongue, and cut mucous membrane. Define nerves, vessels, and sublingual gland. Parts be- neath mylo- hyoid ; above hyoid bone, in front of hyo-glossus. The apex of the tongue is to be now pulled well out of the mouth over the upper teeth, and • fastened with a stitch to the septum of the nose, while the left half of the jaw is to be drawn down forcibly with hooks. The scalpel should be then passed from below upwards between the sawn surfaces of the bone, for the purpose of dividing a strong band of the mucous membrane of the mouth ; and it should be carried onwards along the middle line of the tongue to the tip. By means of a stitch the hyoid bone may be fastened down, to make tight the muscular fibres. All the fat and areolar tissue are to be removed, and in doing this the student is to take care of the Whartonian duct, of the hypoglossal nerve and its branches, which lie on the hyo-glossus muscle, and especially of its small offset ascending to the stylo-glossus muscle; also of the lingual nerve nearer the jaw. Between the lingual nerve and the deep part of the submaxillary gland the dissector should seek the small submaxillary ganglion with its offsets ; and he should endeavour to separate from the trunk of the lingual the small chorda tympani nerve (p. 92), and to define the offset from it to the submaxillary ganglion. At the hinder border of the hyo-glossus clean the lingual vessels, the stylo-hyoid ligament, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, all passing beneath that muscle; and at the anterior border find the issuing ranine artery, which, with the companion vein and lingual nerve, is to be traced on the under surface of the tongue to the tip. ■ Adhering to the mucous membrane of the mouth is the sublingual gland, and this is to be defined, together with the sublingual artery which supplies it. Parts beneath the mylo-hyoid (fig. 24). The relative position of the objects covered by the mylo-hyoid is now apparent:—Extending from the hyoid bone to the side of the tongue is the hyo-glossus muscle, the fibres of which are crossed superiorly by those of the stylo- glossus. On the hyo-glossus are placed, from below upwards, the hypoglossal nerve, Wharton's duct, and the lingual nerve, the latter crossing the duct; and near the anterior border of the muscle the two nerves are united by branches. Beneath the same muscle lie, from below upwards, the lingual artery, the stylo-hyoid ligament, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Above the hyo-glossus is the mucous membrane of the mouth, with the sublingual gland attached to it in front, and some fibres of the superior constrictor muscle covering it behind near the jaw. Between the chin and the hyoid bone, close to the middle line, is situate the genio-hyoid muscle; above this is a larger fan-shaped muscle, the genio-glossus. Along the outer side of the last muscle lie the ranine vessels ; and a sublingual branch for the gland of the same name springs from the lingual artery at the anterior border of the hyo-glossus. On the under surface of the tongue, near the margin, lies the lingual nerve ; and the hypoglossal nerve enters the fibres of the genio-glossus.STYLO-GLOSSUS MUSCLE. 95 Hyo- glossus, in contact with many parts. Use. Stylo- glossus comes to side of tongue. The hyo-glossus muscle (fig. 23,') is thin and somewhat square in shape. It arises from the lateral part of the body, and from all the great cornu, of the hyoid bone. The fibres ascend and enter the side of the tongue ; they will be seen afterwards to mingle with those of the palato- and stylo-glossus.* The parts lying on the outer surface of the hyo-glossus, as well as those passing beneath its anterior and posterior borders, have already been enumerated ; and under the muscle there are also portions of the genio-glossus and middle constrictor. Action. This muscle depresses the tongue, drawing down the sides and giving a rounded form to the dorsum ; and if the tongue is protruded from the mouth, the fibres will draw it backwards into that cavity. The stylo-glossus (fig. 23, 3) is a slender muscle, which arises from the styloid process near the apex, and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and is directed downwards and forwards to' Fig. 23. t the hinder part of the lateral margin of the tongue. Here it gives some fibres to the dorsum, but the greater part of the muscle turns to the under surface, and is con- tinued forwards to the tip of the tongue. Beneath the jaw this muscle is crossed by the lingual nerve. Action. Both muscles will raise the back of the tongue against the roof of the mouth; and if the tongue is protruded they will restore it to the cavity. One muscle can direct the ( ^~n„ / of one. point of the tongue towards its own side of the mouth. The geniohyoid muscle (fig. 23, 4) arises from the lower of the mental spines on the inner aspect of the symphysis of the jaw, and is inserted into the front of the body of the hyoid bone. The lower surface of this muscle is covered by the mylo-hyoid, Relations, and the upper is in contact with the genio-glossus (3). The inner border touches the muscle of the opposite side, and the two are often united. Action. The genio-hyoid either depresses the lower jaw or Use Use of both Genio- hyoid. * A distinct muscular slip (chondro-glossus), arising from the small cornu of the hyoid bone, is sometimes regarded as a part of the hyo-glossus.

The genio-glossus (genio-hyo-glossus, fig. 23, 3) is a thick, fan- shaped muscle, having its apex at the jaw, and its base at the tongue. It takes origin from the upper of the mental spines behind the symphysis of the jaw. From this spot the fibres radiate, tin- posterior passing backwards to their insertion into the body of the hyoid bone, the anterior forwards to the tip of the tongue, and the intermediate ones to the tongue from base to point. Lying close to the median plane, the inner surface of the muscle is in contact with its fellow. Its lower border corresponds to the genio-hyoid, and the upper to the frsenum linguae. On ite outer side are the ranine vessels, and the hyo-glossns muscle ; and the hypoglossal nerve perforates the hinder fibres. Action. By the simultaneous action of the whole muscle the tongue is depressed, and hollowed along the middle. The hinder fibres acting alone raise the hyoid bone and protrude the tongue ; while the anterior retract the tip of the tongue. The lingual ARTERY (fig. 18, /) arises from the external carotid opposite the great cornu of the hyoid bone. At first il is directed forwards above the hyoid bone, and then up-\vards beneath the hyo- glossus to the under part of the tongue (fig. 24) ; it ends at the anterior border of that muscle in the sublingual and ranine branches. Before it reaches the hyo-glossus, the artery forms a small loop, with its convexity upwards, which is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve ; and the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles also lie over the vessel, but are separated from it by the hyo-glossus. The trunk rests on the middle constrictor and genio-glossus muscles. Its branches are:— a. A small hyoid brtmch is distributed to the muscles at the upper border of the hyoid bone ; it anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the hyoid branch of the superior thyroid artery of the same side. b. A branch to the dorsum of the tongue arises beneath the hyo- glossus muscle, and ascends to supply the substance of the tongue and the tonsil. The fibres of the hyo-glossus must be divided to see it. c. The sublingual branch springs from the final division of the artery at the edge of the hyo-glossus, and is directed outwards 1<> the gland of the same name. Some offsets supply the gums an I the contiguous muscles, and one continues behind the incisor teeth to join a similar artery from the other side. d. The ranine branch (fig. 24, 9) is the terminal part of the lingual artery, and extends forwards along the outer side of the genio- glossus to the tip of the tongue where it ends. Muscidar offsets are furnished to the substance of the tongue of the same side This artery is very tortuous, and is embedded in the muscular fibres of the tongue. The lingual artery is accompanied by two small vena comites, but the largest vein of the tongue is the ranine, which lies external to'J 7 LINGUAL NERVE. the artery of the same name, and, after being joined by sublingual branches, passes backwards over the hyo-glossus muscle -with the hypoglossal nerve. These veins end in the internal jugular. The lingual nerve (fig. 24,1) has been followed in the pterygo- Lingual maxillary region to its passage between the ramus of the lower jaw uerve and the internal pterygoid muscle (p. 92). In the submaxillary region the nerve is inclined inwards to the side of the tongue, across along side the mucous membrane of the mouth and the origin of the superior of tonsue constrictor muscle, and above the deep part of the submaxillary Fig. 24.* gland. Lastly, it is directed forwards below the Whartonian duct, and along the side of the tongue to the apex. Branches are fur- nished to the surrounding parts, thus :— Two or more offsets connect it with the submaxillary ganglion, near the gland of that name. Farther forwards one or more branches descend on the hyo- glossus to unite in a loop with twigs of the hypoglossal nerve. Other filaments are supplied to the mucous membrane of the mouth, the gums, and the sublingual gland. Lastly, the branches for the tongue ascend through the muscular substance, and are distributed to the conical and fungiform papilkc. The submaxillary ganglion (fig. 24,2) resembles the other ganglia connected with the three trunks of the fifth nerve, and communicates with motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves.

Connections with nerves—roots. The fibres of the sensory root are derived from the lingual, and of the motor root from the chorda tympani nerves, both joining the upper part of the ganglion. The sympathetic root comes from the plexus on the facial artery. Branches. From the lower part of the ganglion five or six small offsets descend to the submaxillary gland ; and from the fore part other filaments are given to the mucous membrane of the mouth and Wharton's duct. Chorda tympani. Joining the lingual nerve close below its origin (p. 92), the chorda tympani accompanies that trunk, but can be easily separated from it nearly as far as the tongue. Beyond that point its fibres are mixed with those of the lingual nerve. Near the submaxillary gland an offset is sent to the submaxillary ganglion. The hypoglossal or twelfth nerve in the submaxillary region is directed forwards across the lower part of the hyo-glossus muscle and under cover of the mylo-hyoid. At the anterior border of the hyo-glossus it enters the fibres of the genio-glossus, spreading out and dividing into numerous branches as it disappears. Branches. While resting on the hyo-glossus, the twelfth nerve furnishes offsets to the stylo-glossus, hyo-glossus and genio-hyoid muscles, as well as one or two communicating filaments to the lingual nerve. Its terminal branches, within the genio-glossus, supply that muscle and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. The lingual branches are long and slender, and some of them may be traced forwards to the tip of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve (fig. 24,4), appearing between the two carotid arteries, courses forwards over the stylo-pharyngeus, and ends under the hyo-glossus in branches for the tongue. (See the DISSECTION CP THE TONGUE.) The duct of the submaxillary gland (fig. 24,3), Wharton's duct, issues from the deep part of the glandular mass turning round the border of the mylo-hyoid muscle. About two inches in length, it is directed upwards and forwards on the hyo-glossus muscle, and over the lingual nerve, to open on the centre of an eminence by the side of the frsenum lingusB : the opening in the mouth will be seen if a bristle be passed along the duct. The deep part of the sub- maxillary gland extends along the side of the duct, reaching, in some instances, the sublingual gland. The sublingual gland (fig. 24, n) is an almond-shaped body with its longest diameter, which measures about an inch and a half, directed from before backwards. It lies beneath the fore part of the tongue, between the genio-glossus muscle and the lower jaw, and resting on the mylo-hyoid. Its upper border is covered by the mucous membrane, which is raised into a fold along the floor of the mouth over the gland ; and its inner end touches the one of the opposite side behind the symphysis of the jaw.99 DISSECTION OF EIGHT ORBIT. The "land consists of from ten to twenty small masses, each of a™1.' which has a separate duct. The ducts (ducts of Rivinus) open for ture. the most part on the sublingual mucous fold, but some of them join the submaxillary duct, and one larger tube (duct of Bartholin), which is however frequently wanting, springs from the deeper part of the gland and runs forwards to end either in common with, or close to the duct of Wharton. Section VIII. EIGHT OEBIT AND SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. Directions. The student may examine next the right orbit, and Directions, the remaining trunk, superior maxillary, of the fifth nerve. Supposing the right orbit to be untouched, the student may vary Learn right the dissection by exposing it from the outer side. Dissection. For this purpose, first detach the eyelids from the Open orbit outer half of the orbital margin, and with the handle of the scalpel outer side, separate the periosteum from the corresponding part of the wall of the cavity. Then saw vertically through the centre of the upper margin of the orbit, and continue the cut backwards with a chisel to the sphenoidal fissure. Make a farther cut, also with a chisel, (from the inside) along the middle fossa of the base of the skull from the sphenoidal fissure in front to the foramen spinosum behind, and outside the line of the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale. The side of the skull is next to be sawn transversely in front of the petrous part of the temporal bone, so that the incision shall end at the posterior extremity of the cut made in the base. Afterwards the malar bone is to be sawn through into the spheno- maxillary fissure. The piece of the skull, including parts of the frontal, malar, sphenoid, and temporal bones, is now loose, and can be removed with the temporal muscle. If the portion of the roof of the orbit which is left should interfere with the view of the contents of the cavity in the later stages of the dissection, let it be taken away with the bone-forceps. The desciiption that has been given of the contents of the left orbit (pp. 39, et seq.) may be used also for the right side. The following will serve as a guide to the steps of the dissection :— On removing the periosteum, the external rectus muscle will be Order of the at once seen, and its two heads should be defined, with the nerves dissection- entering the cavity above and between them. Along the upper border of the muscle the lachrymal nerve and artery are to be followed to the lachrymal gland, and beyond these the levator palpebrse superioris and superior rectus muscles are exposed, as well as the frontal and fourth nerves. When these have been studied, tin- external rectus, with the lachrymal vessels and nerve, are to be divided in the middle, and the parts thrown forwards and back- wards. Then take away the fat from the lenticular ganglion, the n 2100 DISSECTION OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. Superior maxillary nerve. Dissection in spheno- maxillary fossa; in floor of orbit. Infraorbital vessels. Upper max- illary nerve passes to face through infraorbital canal. Its branches are—to orbit; to the nose and palate ; "to the hinder teeth and cheek ; to fore teeth; nasal, third and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic artery at the hack of the orhit, and clean the inferior oblique muscle in front as it arches round the eyeball. To see fully the remaining muscles, the course of the ophthalmic artery and nasal nerve, and the lower division of the third nerve, it will be necessary to divide the frontal nerve, the levator palpebral and superior rectus muscles, and the optic nerve. The superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, in its course to the face, is placed successively in the skull, the spheno-maxillary fossa, and the infraorbital canal. The beginning of the nerve in the cranium has been already demonstrated (p. 18). Dissection. In the spheno-maxillary fossa the nerve can be partly seen by the dissection already made for the orbit, and its exposure here will be completed by removing the fat, and cutting away more of the great wing of the sphenoid bone, so as to leave only an osseous ring round the nerve at its exit from the skull. In the fossa the student seeks the following offsets,—the orbital branch entering the cavity of the orbit, branches to Meckel's ganglion which descend in the fossa, and the posterior dental branch along the back of the upper jaw. To follow onwards the nerve in the floor of the orbit, the con- tents of the cavity having been taken away, the bony canal in which it lies must be opened to its termination on the face. From the infraorbital canal the anterior and middle dental brandies are to be traced downwards for some distance in the bone. The infra- orbital vessels are prepared with the nerve. The superior maxillary nerve (fig. 25) commences at the Gasserian ganglion (p. 18), and leaves the cranium by the foramen rotundum. The course of the nerve is almost straight to the face, across the spheno-maxillary fossa, and along the orbital plate of the upper maxilla through the infraorbital canal. Issuing from the canal by the infraorbital foramen, where it is concealed hy the elevator of the upper hp, it ends in infraorhital or facial branches which radiate to the eyelid, nose, and upper hp. Branches.—a. The orbited or temporo-malar branch (4) has already been described (p. 49). Its two divisions have been destroyed on the right side in opening the orbit. b. The sphenopalatine branches (3) descend from the nerve in the fossa, and supply the nose and the palate ; they are connected with Meckel's ganglion, and will be dissected with it (Section XIV). c. The posterior dental branch (5) leaves the nerve near the upper jaw. It enters a canal in the maxilla, and supplies branches to the molar teeth and the lining membrane of the antrum ; near the teeth it joins the middle dental branch. Before entering the canal it furnishes one or more offsets to the gum and the mucous mem- brane of the cheek. d and e. The middle and anterior dental branches arise together or separately from the trunk in the floor of the orbit, and descend in special canals in the wall of the antrum to end in branches to101 INFRAORBITAL ARTERY. the teeth, after forming loops of conmiunication with one another, and with the posterior dental nerve. From the middle branch filaments are given to the bicuspid teeth ; and froni the anterior to the canine and incisors, as well as a twig or two to the inferior meatus of the nose. /. The palpebral branches are usually two small twigs which turn to lower upwards round the margin of the infraorbital foramen to reach the e>ei ' lower lid. a. The lateral nasal branches are directed inwards, and supply to side of the skin of the side of the nose. h. The labial branches, three or four in number, are larger than and to upper the others, and descend to the lip, supplying the skin of the face Up' Fig. 25.* between the orbit and the mouth, as well as the mucous membrane of the upper lip. Their ramifications are crossed by, and com- joining municate with the infraorbital branches of the facial nerve, the facial- whole forming the infraorbital plexus (p. 38). The infraorbital artery is a branch of the internal maxillary infraorbital (p. 89). Taking the course of the nerve through the infraorbital artery canal, the vessel appears on the face beneath the elevator muscle of the upper lip; and it ends in branches which are distributed, like those of the nerve, between the eye and mouth. On the face ends in its branches anastomose with onsets of the facial and buccalface: arteries. In the canal in the maxilla the artery furnishes small o^|t°lies twigs to the orbit, and a larger anterior dental branch which rims and one t" with the nerve of the same name to the incisor and canine teeth : teeth"" the dental branch also gives offsets to the antrum, and near the teeth it anastomoses with the posterior dental artery.

To see the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the posterior rhaiyngeus, belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle should be de- tached from their origin and thrown down. The trunk of the external carotid artery is to be removed by cutting it through where the hypoglossal nerve crosses it, and by dividing those branches of it that have been already examined ; any veins accom- panying the arteries are to be taken away.

It raises the pharynx, and tends to dilate the part of the cavity above the hyoid bone. From its attachment to the thyroid cartilage it will assist in elevating and drawing backwards the larynx.

Sometimes a slip of fleshy fibres is continued along it. Internal The internal carotid artery supplies the deep parts of the carotid ^ad, viz., the brain, the contents of the orbit, and the nose; and takes a circuitous course through and along the base of the skull before it ends in branches to the cerebrum.

The terminal branches of the carotid are examined with the brain. Dissection. For the display of the cervical part of the artery Dissection (fig. 26) there is now but little dissection required. By detaching theneck^ the styloid process at the root, and throwing it forwards with its muscles, the internal carotid artery and the jugular vein may be followed upwards to the skull. Only a dense fascia conceals them ; and this is to be taken away carefully, so that the branches of the nerves may not be injured. In the fascia, and directed forwards over the artery, seek the a"a crania ' nerves ■ glosso-pharyngeal nerve and its branches near the skull, and the small pharyngeal branch of the vagus lower down ; still lower, the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus, with its external laryngeal offset, crossing beneath the carotid. Between the vein and artery, close to the skull, will be found the vagus, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves ; and crossing backwards, over or under the vein, the spinal accessory nerve. External to the vessels the loop of the first and second cervical nerves over the transverse process of the atlas is to be defined; and from it branches of communication are to be traced to the large ganglion of the sympathetic beneath the artery, and to the vagus and hypoglossal nerves. Ascending to the cranium, on the inner side of the carotid, the ascending pharyn- geal artery will be met with. To open the carotid canal in the temporal bone, and to follow in the tem- the contained artery into the cranium, make a cut along the side; of poral boue- the skull in the following manner:—the saw being placed behind the mastoid process, cut forwards to the foramen spinosmn in the ■wing of the sphenoid bone (to which spot the side of the skull has been already taken away), and let the instrument be directed through the stylo-mastoid foramen and the root of the styloid process, but rather external to the jugular foramen and the carotid canal. When the piece of bone has been detached, the carotid canal may be opened with the bone forceps. In cleaning the artery in the canal, large and rather red branches Nerves on it. of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic will be found on it; and in a fresh part two'small filaments may be recognised with care,—one from Jacobson's nerve, joining the sjanpathetic at the posterior part of the canal; the other from the Vidian nerve, at the front of the canal.

Its lower dilatation and its valve have been before referred to (p. 76). The following branches open into the internal jugular, viz., the inferior petrosal sinus close below the skull, the pharyngeal, lingual, facial and superior thyroid veins near the hyoid bone, and tlie middle thyroid vein opposite the lower part of the larynx. The ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY (fig. 26, (j) is a long slender branch of the external carotid, which arises near the begin- ning of that vessel. It runs upwards between the internal carotid artery and the pharynx to near the base of the skull, where it ends in pharyngeal and meningeal branches. Its offsets are numerous, but small :— a. One or more prevertebral branches pass to the longus colli and recti antici muscles, supplying also the nerves and lymphatic glands of this region. 6. Pharyngeal brandies supply the wall of the pharynx, the soft palate and the tonsil. The highest of these, one of the terminal branches of the artery, ramifies in the superior constrictor, the Eusta- chian tube, and the levator and tensor palati muscles: this branch is sometimes large and furnishes the inferior palatine artery instead of the facial (p. 79). c. The meningeal branches enter the skull through the foramen lacerum, the jugular foramen and the anterior condylar foramen (p. 16). These arteries are seldom injected. The pharyngeal veins form a plexus which empties itself into the internal jugular trunk. Dissection of the cranial nerves in the neck. By the time this stage of the dissection has been arrived at, the condition of the parts will not permit the tracing of the very minute filaments of the cranial nerves in the jugular foramen, and all the paragraphs marked with an asterisk are therefore to be omitted for the present. Afterwards, if a fresh piece of the skull can be obtained, in which the bone has been softened by acid and the nerves hardened in spirit, the exami- nation of the branches now passed over may be made. * In the jugular foramen. Supposing the dissection of the internal carotid to be earned out as it is described at page 103, let the student cut across with care the jugular vein near the skull. Let him then remove bit by bit with the bone forceps, or with a scalpel if the part has been softened, the ring of bone which bounds exter- nally the jugular foramen, proceeding as far forwards as the osseous crest between that foramen and the carotid canal. Between the bone and the coat of the jugular vein, the small auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric nerve is to be found; it is directed backwards to an aperture near the styloid process. * Trace then the spinal accessory and pneumo-gastric nerves through the aperture, by opening the fibrous sheath around them. Two parts, large and small, of the spinal accessory nerve shouldDISSECTION OF NEEVES. 107 be defined; the latter is to be shown joining a ganglion on the vagus, and applying itself to the trunk of that nerve. A commu- nication between the two pieces of the spinal accessory is to be found. On the pneiuno-gastric is a small well-marked ganglion, from which the auricular branch before referred to takes origin ; and from the ganglion filaments are to be sought passing to the smaller portion of the spinal accessory nerve, and to the ascending branch of the upper cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. * Next follow the glosso-pharyngeal nerve through the fore part afterwards of the foramen, and take away any bone that overhangs it. This ^yngeal*8'" nerve presents two ganglia as it passes from the skull (fig. 2 7) : one jugular), which is scarcely to be perceived, near the upper part of the tube of membrane containing it; the other, much larger (petrous), is situate at the hinder border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. From the lower one, seek the small nerve of and its Jacobson, which enters an aperture in the crest of bone between the bl'anc]ies- jugular foramen and the carotid canal, and another filament of communication with the ganglion of the sympathetic. Sometimes the dissector will be able to find a filament from the lower ganglion to join the auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric, and another to end in the upper ganglion of the pneumo-gastric nerve. Below the foramen of exit from the skull, the cranial nerves have Dissection been for the most part denuded by the dissection of the internal °„ the "neck* carotid ; but the intercommunications of the vagus, hypoglossal, sympathetic, and first two spinal nerves, near the skull, are to be traced out more completely.

The chief part of the glosso-pharyngeal has also been dissected ; of giosso- but the offsets on the carotid, and others to the pharynx in front of ijharyi,8eal: the artery are to be defined. On the pneumo-gastric trunk the student will find an enlarge- of vagus; ment close to the skvdl (ganglion of the trunk), to which the hypo- glossal nerve is intimately united. From the ganglion proceed two pharyngeal branches (pharyngeal and laryngeal), which are to be traced to the plexus> parts indicated by their names, especially the first which enters the pharyngeal plexus. The task of exposing the ramifications of the branch of the vagus, and those of the glosso-pharyngeal and sympa- thetic in the plexus, is by no means easy, in consequence of the dense tissue in which they are contained. Two or more cardiac cardiac offsets of the vagus, one at the upper and another at the lower part °asets' of the neck, may be recognised readily. Lastly, the dissector may prepare more fully the recurrent branch coursing up beneath the and recur- lower end of the common carotid : by removing the fat around it, rent' offsets may be seen passing to the chest and the windpipe.

Distributed to pharynx, (p. 113) ; but its large ganglion near the skull (upper cervical) should he cleaned, and the branches from it to the pharyngeal plexus should be pursued beneath the carotid artery. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves (glossopharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory) leave the cranium together by the jugular foramen (p. 19), from which circumstance they were formerly grouped together as one nerve—the eighth nerve of Willis. Outside the skull the nerves take different directions to their destination ; thus the glosso-pharyngeal is inclined forwards to the tongue and pharynx ; the spinal accessory backwards to the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles ; and the pneumo-gastric nerve descends to the viscera of the thorax and abdomen. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve (fig. 27,:) is the smallest of the three trunks. In the jugular foramen it is placed somewhat in front of the other two, and hies in a groove in the hinder border of the petrous part of the temporal bone. In the aperture of exit the nerve is marked by two ganglionic swellings, the upper one being the j ugular, and the lower the petrous ganglion. The jugular ganglion (4) is very small, and is situate at the upper end of the osseous groove containing the nerve. It includes only the outer fibres of the nerve, and is not always to be recognised. The petrous ganglion (5) is much larger, and encloses all the fibrds of the nerve. Ovalish in form, it is placed in a hollow in the posterior border of the temporal bone ; and from it spring the branches that unite the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves. After the nerve has quitted the foramen, it comes forwards between the jugular vein and the carotid artery (fig. 26,]), and descends over the artery until it reaches the hinder border of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. Then curving forwards, it becomes almost transverse in direction, crosses the stylo-pharyngeus, and finally passes beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, where it ends in branches to the tongue. The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal may be classed into those connecting it with other nerves at the base of the skull, and those distributed in the neck. The connecting branches arise from the petrous ganglion; and in this set is the tympanic nerve. * A filament ascends from the sympathetic nerve in the neck to join the petrous ganglion. Sometimes there is an offset from the ganglion to the auricular branch of the vagus, and another to the upper ganglion of this nerve. * The tympanic branch (nerve of Jacobson—fig. 27,°) enters the aperture in the ridge of bone between the jugular and the carotid foramina, and ascends by a special canal to the inner wall of the tympanum : its distribution is given with the anatomy of the middle ear (Chapter XI). Branches for distribution. In the neck the branches are fur- nished chiefly to the pharynx and the tongue. a. Pharyngeal branches.

The terminal branches of the nerve supply and tongue, the binder part of the tongue, in connection with which they are described (Section XV). The pneumo-gastric or vagus nerve (fig. 27,2) is the largest Vagus nerve of the cranial nerves in the neck, and escapes through the jugular foramen in the same sheath of dura mater as the spinal accessory. In the foramen it has a distinct gang- lion (gang, of the root), to which the smaller part of the spinal acces- sory nerve is connected. When the nerve has left the fora- men, it receives the small part of the spinal accessory, and swells into a ganglion nearly an inch long (gang, of the trunk). This ganglion lies between the internal carotid artery and jugular vein, and communicates with several nerves. To reach the thorax, the vagus descends almost vertically (fig. 26,3) between the in- ternal jugular vein and the internal and common carotid arteries ; and it enters that cavity, on the right side, by crossing over the subclavian artery, but beneath the innominate vein. * The ganglion of the root (fig. 27,b) is of a greyish colour, and in texture is like the ganglion on the large root of the fifth nerve. Small branches in the jugular foramen come from this ganglion. The ganglion of the trunk (9) is cylindrical in form, reddish in colour, and nearly an inch in length ; it communicates with the hypoglossal, spinal, and sympathetic nerves.

The auricular branch (Arnold's nerve,7) is the chief offset, and crosses the jugular fossa to enter an aperture near the root of the styloid process : it traverses the substance of the temporal bone, and is distributed to the outer ear. Its farther course will be described with the anatomy of the ear. * One or two short filaments unite this ganglion with the small part of the spinal accessory nerve ; and a branch from the upper ganglion of the sympathetic enters it. Occasionally there is an offset (10) to join the petrous ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve. From the ganglion of the trunk Communicating filaments pass between it and the hypoglossal nerve. Other branches connect it to the upper ganglion of the sympathetic and the loop of the first two cervical nerves. Branches for distribution. The cervical branches arise from the lower ganglion and the trunk of the nerve, and are directed inwards, to supply the pharynx, tlie larynx, and the heart. a. The pharyngeal branch (fig. 27,ia) springs from the upper part of the ganglion of the trunk, and is directed inwards over the internal carotid artery to the side of the pharynx, being joined in its course by the descending pharyngeal branches of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve. On the surface of the middle constrictor, the ramifications of the united nerves communicate freely together, and with the pharyngeal branches of the sympathetic, to form the pharyngeal plexus. The offsets of the plexus enter the wall of the pharynx and supply the constrictor muscles, the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus, and the mucous membrane between the mouth and the larynx. According to Luschka, Henle, and others, a branch ascends from the plexus to the levator palati and azygos u'vuLb muscles. 6. The superior laryngeal nerve (fig. 27,14) is much larger than the preceding branch, and comes from the middle of the ganglion of the trunk. It runs obliquely downwards and forwards, passing on the inner side of the internal and external carotids (fig. 26,6), to the interval between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage. Here it perforates the thyro-hyoid membrane, and divides into branches for the supply of the mucous membrane of the larynx (Section XVI). While beneath the internal carotid artery it furnishes the following offset :— The external laryngeal Irranch (fig. 26,"') descends on the inferior constrictor muscle to the side of the larynx, and then beneath the stemo-thyroid to the crico-thyroid muscle in which it ends.

It gives distinct off- sets to join the pharyngeal and upper laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric ; and other fibres are continued into the cardiac and inferior laryngeal branches.

Sympathetic anterior condylar foramen, is at first deeply placed between the internal carotid artery and the jugular vein (fig. 26 4). It next comes forwards between the vein and artery, turning round the outer side of the vagus to which it is closely united. The nerve now descends La the neck, and becomes superficial below the digastric muscle in the anterior triangular space (p. 77) ; from this spot it is directed forwards to the tongue and its muscles (p. 98). Connecting branches. Near the skull the hypoglossal is united to the lower ganglion of the vagus by filaments crossing between the two nerves as tln-y are in contact. A little lower down the nerve is joined by offsets from the sympathetic and the loop of the first two spinal nerves. The branches for distribution have been met with in the foregoing dissections. Thus, in the neck it supplies, in common with the spinal nerves, the depressors of the hyoid bone. In the sub- maxillary region it furnishes branches to one elevator (genio-hyoid) of the hyoid bone, to the extrinsic muscles of the tongue except the palato-glossus, and to all the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Dissection. The small rectus capitis lateralis muscle, between the transverse process of the atlas and the base of the skull, is now to be cleaned and learnt. At its inner border the anterior branch of the first cervical nerve, which forms a loop in front of the atlas, i s to be found. The rectus capitis lateralis (fig. 26) is very short, and repre- sents a posterior intertransverse muscle. It arises from the fore and upper part of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the jugular process of the occipital bone. On the anterior surface rests the jugular vein ; and in contact with the posterior are the obliquus superior and the vertebral artery. To the inner side lie the anterior primary branch of the first cervical nerve and the rectus anticus minor muscle. Action. It assists the muscles attached to the mastoid process in inclining the head laterally. Dissection. For the purpose of tracing backwards the anterior branch of the first cervical nerve, divide the rectus lateralis muscle, observing the offset to it; then cut off the end of the transverse process of the atlas, and remove the vertebral artery, so as to bring into view the nerve as it lies on the first vertebra. The anterior primary branch of the first cervical or sub- occipital nerve is rather smaller than the posterior, and arises from the common trunk on the neural arch of the atlas. From that spot it is directed forwards above the transverse process, and on the inner side of the vertebral artery, to the interval between the rectus lateralis and rectus anticus minor muscles. Emerging here it bends down in front of the transverse process of the atlas and forms a loop with the second cervical nerve. As the nerve passes forwards it supplies the rectus lateralis and anticus minor muscles, and branches connect the loop with the vagus, hypoglossal, and sympa- thetic nerves. Sympathetic Nerve.

On this neok portion of the nerve are three ganglia—the superior near the skull, has three the middle towards the lower part of the neck, and the inferior ganglia close to the first rib. From the ganglia proceed connecting branches to the spinal and most of the cranial nerves in the neck, and branches for distribution to viscera and blood-vessels. Besides the ganglia above mentioned,, there are other ganglia in other gang- the head and neck, where the sympathetic enters iuto connection nerve. with the three divisions of the fifth nerve. Dissection. To display the branches of the sympathetic nerve Dissection requires greater care than is necessary in tracing the white-fibred gangikm; nerves, for they are softer, more easily torn, and generally of smaller size. In the neck the ganglia and their branches have been partly prepared, and only the following additional dissection, will be required to bring them into view :—The jugular vein having been cut through, the upper ganglion will be seen by raising the carotid artery, and the trunks of the vagus and hypo- glossal nerves, and by cutting through the branches that unite these two to the loop between the first and second spinal nerves. The several branches of the ganglion are to be traced upwards on the carotid artery, inwards to the pharynx, down along the neck, and outwards to other nerves. The dissector has already seen the middle ganglion on or near of middle; the inferior thyroid artery ; and its branches to spinal nerves, and along the neck, are now to be traced. To obtain a view of the inferior ganglion the greater part of the and inferior first rib is to be taken away, and the subclavian artery is to be cut °ansllon' through, internal to the scalenus, and drawn aside, without however destroying the line nerves that pass over it. It is supposed that the clavicle has been removed. The ganglion is placed close above the neck of the first rib ; its branches are large, and are easily followed outwards to the vertebral artery and the spinal nerves, and down- wards to the thorax. The superior cervical ganglion is the largest of the three, and superior is of a reddish-grey colour. Fusiform in shape, it is as long as ^p'sJjEu' the second and third cervical vertebrae, and is placed on the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, beneath the internal carotid artery and beneath the contiguous cranial nerves. Branches connect the ganglion with oarotid' other nerves ; and some are distributed to the blood-vessels, the pharynx, and the heart.

Communications are formed with several other cranial nerves by means of the ascending offset from the ganglion into the carotid canal (p. 19). Branches for distribution. The branches of this set are more numerous than the preceding, and the nerves are generally of larger size. The ascending branch, prolonged from the upper part of the ganglion, accompanies the internal carotid artery and its branches. X^ar the skull it divides into two pieces, which enter the canal for the carotid, one on each side of that vessel, and are continued to the eyeball and the pia mater of the brain, forming secondary idexuses on the ophthalmic and cerebral arteries. In the carotid canal communications are formed with the tympanic nerve (p. 108), and with the spheno-palatine ganglion (p. 142) ; with the former near the lower end, and with the latter near the upper opening of the canal. The communications and plexuses which these nerves form in their course to the brain are described at p. 19. Branches for blood-vessels (nervi molles). These nerves surround the external carotid trunk, and ramify on its branches so as to form plexuses on the arteries with the same names as the vessels : some small ganglia are occasionally found on these slender nerves. By means of the plexus on the facial artery the submaxillary ganglion com- municates with tin; sympathetic; and through the plexus on the internal maxillary artery the otic ganglion obtains a similar communication. The pharyngeal nerves pass inwards to the side of the pharynx, where they join with the branches of the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumo-gastric nerves in the pharyngeal plexus (p. 110). Cardiac nerves enter the thorax to join in the plexuses of the heart. There are three cardiac nerves on each side, viz., superior, middle, and inferior, each taking its name from the ganglion of which it is an offset. The superior or superficial cardiac nerve of the right side courses behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, and enters the thorax along the innominate artery. In the neck the nerve is connected with the cardiac branch of the vagus, with the external laryngeal, and with the recurrent nerve. In some bodies it ends by joining one of the other cardiac nerves. The middle cervical or thyroid ganglion is of small size, and is situate beneath the great vessels, usually opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, on or near the inferior thyroid artery. Its branches are the following :— Connecting brandies with the spinal nerves sink between the borders of the longus colli and anterior scalenus, to join the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. A considerable branch passes between the middle and inferior cervical ganglia, forming a loop (ansa Vieussenii) over the front of the subclavian artery, and supplying it with filaments.LEFT SIDE OF NECK. 11$ Branches for distribution.

On this side the clavicle is to remain articulated, in order that the joint may afterwards be studied. The left subclavian artery arises from the arch of the aorta, instead of from an innominate trunk, and ascends thence over the first rib in its course to the upper limb. With this difference on the two sides in the origin of the subclavian—the one vessel beginning opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation, the other in the thorax—it is evident that the length and relations of the part of the artery on the inner side of the scalenus anticus must also differ on the two sides. First part. The part of the artery internal to the anterior scalenus is much longer on the left than the right side. It ascends nearly vertically from its origin to the level of the first rib, and then bends somewhat abruptly outwards over the top of the lung. On leaving the chest it is deeply placed in the neck, near the spine and the (.esophagus, and does not rise usually so high above the first rib as the right subclavian. Between the artery and the surface are structures like those on the right side, viz., the integuments with the platysma and deep fascia, and the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid muscles. To the inner side are the oesophagus and the thoracic duct ; and the pleura is in contact with the outer and posterior surfaces. Its rela- tions lower in the chest are described in the dissection of the thorax. Veins. The internal jugular and vertebral veins, as well as the beginning of the innomhiate, are in front of this part of the artery. Nerves. The pneumo-gastric nerve lies parallel to the vessel instead of across it as on the right side; and the phrenic nerve crosses over it close to the scalenus. Accompanying the artery are the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, which course along its inner side to the chest. The second and third parts of the artery, viz., beneath and beyond the scalenus, are essentially the same as on the right side (p. 68). The brandies of this artery resemble so closely those of the right trunk, that one description will serve for both (pp. 69 to 71). It may be remarked that the superior intercostal of the left side is usually internal to, instead of beneath the scalenus as on the right, side ; in other words, this branch arises sooner. The thoracic duct (fig. 28,8) conveys the chyle and lymph of the <rreater part of the body into the venous circulation. Escaping from the thorax on the left side of the oesophagus, the duct ascends in the neck as high as the seventh cervical vertebra. At the spot mentioned it issues from beneath the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, arching outwards and downwards above or over the subclavian artery, and in front of the anterior scalenus muscle and phrenic nerve, to open into the angle of junction of the subclavianCOMMON CAROTID ARTERY.

Weight and size. No duct Arteries, superior, position of the several parts entering or leaving the thorax by the upper opening may be now observed. In the middle line lie the remains of the thymus gland, and the trachea and oesophagus. In front of the trachea are the lower ends of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles with layers of the cervical fascia, and the inferior thyroid veins ; and behind the gullet and windpipe are the longi colli muscles. Between the two tubes is the recurrent nerve on the left side. On each side the dome of the pleura and the apex of the lung project into the neck ; and in the interval between the pleura and the trachea and oesophagus, are placed the vessels and nerves passing between the thorax and the neck. Most anteriorly on both sides lie the innominate vein, the phrenic nerve, and the internal mam- mary artery ; but the vessels and nerves next met with are different on the two sides :—On the right side come the innominate artery, with the vagus, the cardiac nerves, and the right lymphatic duct. On the left side are the left vagus, the left common carotid artery, the thoracic duct, and the left subclavian artery with the cardiac nerves. Lastly, altogether behind on each side are part of the first dorsal nerve, the cord of the sympathetic, and the superior inter- costal artery. The thyroid body (fig. 16,12) is a soft reddish mass, which embraces the upper part of the trachea. It consists of two lateral lobes, united by a narrow piece across the front of the windpipe. The connecting piece, from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch in depth, is named the isthmus, and is placed over the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea. Each lobe is somewhat conical in shape, with the smaller end upwards, and is about two inches in length. It is interposed between the windpipe with the larynx and the sheath of the common carotid artery, and is covered by the sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, and omo-hyoid muscles. The extent of the lobe varies ; but usually it reaches as high as the middle of the thyroid cartilage, and as low- as the sixth ring of the trachea. From the upper border of the thyroid body, a conical process, known as the pyramid, often ascends towards the hyoid bone, to which it is attached by a fibrous band. The pyramid generally springs from the inner part of one of the lateral lobes, seldom from the isthmus ; and it is sometimes connected to the hyoid bone by a slip of muscle, the levator glandulai thyroidece of Scemmerring. Detached portions of glandular substance, or accessory thyroid glands, are not unfrequently found between the main body and the hyoid bone. The thyroid body is of a brownish red or purple hue, is granular in texture, and weighs from one to two ounces. It is larger in the woman than in the man. On cutting into the gland a viscid yellowish fluid escapes. It has not any excretory tube or duct. The arteries of the thyroid body are two on each side—superior and inferior thyroid. The branches of the external carotids (superior thyroid) ramify chiefly on the anterior aspect: while those from119 TRACHEA AND (ESOPHAGUS. the subclavians (inferior thyroid) pierce the deep surface of the inferior, mass. Occasionally there is a third branch (art. thyroidea ima) which a»d somo- arises from the innominate artery in the thorax, and ascending in tnyroidT front of the trachea assists in supplying the thyroid body. The veins are large and numerous ; they are superior, middle, Veins, and inferior thyroid on each side. The first two enter the internal jugular vein (p. 76). The inferior thyroid veins issue from the Inferior, lower part of the thyroid body, and descend on the trachea, forming jj'exus on a plexus on that tube beneath the sterno-thyroid muscles ; they trachea, enter finally the innominate veins. The trachea, or windpipe, is continued from the larynx to the Trachea thorax, and ends by dividing into two tubes (bronchi), one for each lung. It occupies the middle line of the body, and extends com- lies in neck monly from the lower part of the sixth cervical to the lower border ancl fllonix- of the fourth dorsal vertebra, measuring about four inches and a Size, half in length, and nearly one in breadth. The front and sides of the trachea are rounded in consequence of the existence of firm cartilaginous bands in those parts of the wall; but at the posterior Form, aspect the cartilages are absent, and the wall is flat and mem- branous. The cervical part of the trachea is very moveable, and has the Cervical following relative position to the surrounding parts. Covering it in a"ongSt front are the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, with the deep muscles cervical fascia : beneath those muscles is the inferior thyroid plexus of veins; and near the larynx is the isthmus of the thyroid body. Behind the tube is the oesophagus, with the recurrent nerves. On and vessels, each side are the common carotid artery and the thyroid body. The structure of the trachea is described in Section XVII. The oesophagus, or gullet, reaches from the phaiynx to the (Esophagus stomach. It commences, like the trachea, opposite the lower part occupies of the sixth cervical vertebra, and ends opposite the tenth dorsal thorax!' vertebra. The tube reaches through part of the neck, and through the whole of the thorax. Its length is about nine inches. Length.

Behind the oesophagus are the and rela- longi colli muscles.

The structure of the oesophagus will be examined in the dissection of the thorax. Directions.

For the display of the two lower ganglia of the .sym- pathetic and their branches, it will be necessary to take away the great blood-vessels by cutting them across at the lower part of the neck, and near the digastric muscle. In removing the vessels, care must be taken of the sympathetic beneath them. The middle ganglion must be sought in the fat and areolar tissue near the inferior thyroid artery ; and the inferior one will be seen above the neck of the first rib, after the subclavian artery has been divided. The upper cardiac nerve may be found descending beneath the carotid sheath. The upper end of the sternum with the attached clavicle is to be taken away next, by cutting through the middle of the first rib ; and the piece of bone is to be put aside for the subsequent exami- nation of the sterno-clavicular articulation. The middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic nerve are so similar to the corresponding ganglia of the right side, that the same description will suffice (p. 114). The cardiac nerves are three in number on the left as on the right side, viz., superior, middle, and inferior, but they present some dil Terences. The superior cardiac nerve has a similar course in the neck on both sides ; but the left in entering the chest lies between and parallel to the carotid and subclavian arteries, and it ends in the superficial cardiac plexus. The middle cardiac nerve unites frequently with the next, and passes beneath the subclavian artery to the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerve is generally a small branch, which enters the thorax conjoined with the preceding, to end in the deep cardiac plexus. Section XI. DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. Directions. The pharynx can be examined only when it has been separated from the back of the head and the spinal column ; and it will therefore be necessary to cut through the base of the skull in the manner indicated below, so as to have the anterior half, with the pharynx connected to it, detached from the posterior half.

Next the trachea and oesophagus, together with the vagus and sympathetic nerves, are to be cut near the first rib, and all are to be separated from the spine as high as the basilar process of the occipital bone, but without injuring, on the left side, the vessels and nerves near the skull. For the division of the skull turn upwards the inner surface of121 PREPARATION OF PHARYNX. the base, and make the following incisions in the posterior fossa. On the right side a cut, with the chisel, is to be carried along the cut bnsc of line of union of the petrous part of the temporal with the occipital ft.om £sia| bone. On the left side another cut with the chisel is to be made in the same direction, but through the occipital bone internal to the jugular foramen and the inferior petrosal sinus ; this is to begin lather behind that foramen, and to end opposite the one on the other side. The skull is then to be sawn through vertically on the saw left side L i t side close behind the mastoid process, so that the incision shall of sku"' meet the posterior end of the cut made with the chisel. Finally, placing the skull again upside down, let the student cut awl chisel through the basilar process of the occipital bone between the attach- basilar1 e nients of the pharynx and the muscles of the spinal colivmn, the Process: chisel being directed backwards. The base of the skull is now then cut divided into two parts (one having the pharynx attached to it, the so 1>ai s' other articulating with the spine), which can be readily separated with a scalpel. The spinal column with the piece of the occipital bone connected Preserve with it should be set aside, and kept for after examination. spine.0 Dissection of the pharynx (fig. 29). Let the student take the Fasten anterior part of the divided skull, and, after moderately filling pIiary,lx' the pharynx with tow, fasten it with hooks on a block, so that the oesophagus may be pendent and towards him. On the left side of the pharynx a different view from that of the Dissect right side may be obtained of the cranial and sympathetic nerves feft^sWe"1 near the skull (p. 108), when some loose areolar tissue and the styloid process with its mirscles have been removed : if the lower ends of the nerves are fixed with pieces of thread, they can be more easily displayed. Afterwards the dissector may proceed to remove the fascia from then the constrictor muscles of the right side (fig. 29), in the direction n^scIes' of the fibres,—these radiating from the side to the middle line. The margins of the two lower constrictor muscles (middle and in- lower and ferior) are to be defined. Beneath the lower one, near the larynx, ^di^rcon" will be found the recurrent nerve with vessels ; between the inferior and middle are the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels ; and the stylo-pharyngeus muscle disappears beneath the upper border of the middle constrictor. To see the attachment of the superior constrictor to the lower upper con- jaw and the pterygo-maxillary ligament, it will be necessary to cutstrictor- through the internal pterygoid muscle of the right side. Above the upper fibres of this constrictor, and near the base of the skull, arc two small muscles of the palate (f and h) entering the pharynx: one, tensor palati, lies close inside the internal pterygoid muscle ; and the other, levator palati, is deeper and larger. The Pharynx is a portion of the alimentary canal which gives Pharynx passage to both food and air. It is placed behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and extends from the base of the skull to the lower Extcut border of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, where it ends in the oesophagus, on a level with the lower part of the sixth cervicalDISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. 122 form, Length.

In form it is somewhat conical, with the dilated part upwards ; and its length averages about four and a half inches, but varies according to the position of the head and the degree of eleva- tion of the larynx. The tube of the pharynx is incomplete in front, where it com- municates with the cavities above mentioned, but is quite closed above, behind, and at the sides. Below, it opens into the gullet. On each side of it are placed the trunks of the carotid arteries, with the internal jugular vein, and the accompanying cranial and sym- pathetic nerves. Behind it is the spinal column, covered by muscles, viz., longi colli and recti capitis antici. In front, the pharynx is united to the larynx, the hyoid bone, the tongue, and the bony framework of the nasal fossa?, which form the boundaries of its cavity in this direction. Behind and at the sides, it lias a special muscular wall, and is only muted by very loose connective tissue to surrounding parts. At the upper end the bag is completed by a fibrous aponeurosis which fixes it to the base of the skull; and the whole is lined by mucous membrane. The aponeurosis of attachment is seen at the upper part of the pharynx, where the muscular fibres are absent, to connect the tube to the base of the skull, and to complete the posterior boundary. Superiorly it is fixed to the basilar process of the occipital, and the petrous part of tin- temporal bone; but inferiorly it becomes thin, ami is lost in the layer of connective tissue between the muscular and mucous strata. On this membrane some of the fibres of the superior constrictor muscle terminate. The Muscles of the pharyngeal wall are arranged in two layers— an outer comprising the three constrictors, the fibres of which run more or less transversely to the direction of the tube, and an inner of longitudinal fibres derived from the stylo-pharyngeus and palato- pharyugeus. Externally the constrictor muscles are covered by a fascia, which is continued forwards above* beneath the internal pterygoid muscle, to the surface of the buccinator (bucco-pharvngeal fascia, p. 26). The inferior constrictor (fig. 29,a), the most superficial, arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage, and from the inferior cornu, oblique line, and upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The origin is small when compared with the insertion, for the fibres radiate as they pass backwards, to be inserted along the middle line, where the muscles of opposite sides join. The outer surface of the muscle is in contact with the sheath of the carotid vessels, and with the muscles covering the spinal column. The lower border is nearly horizontal, and beneath it the inferior laryngeal nerve and vessels (5) pass ; while the upper border ascends very obliquely and overlaps the middle constrictor. A few of the lowest fibres of the muscle turn downwards, and are continued into the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus. The middle constrictor (fig. 29,b) has a similar shape to the preceding, that is to say, it is narrowed in front and expanded behind. Its fibres arise from the great and small comua of the hyoid bone,MIDDLE CONSTRICTOR MUSCLE. and from the stylohyoid ligament. From this origin the fibres radiate, and are blended along the middle line with those of the opposite muscle. The posterior surface of this muscle is to a great extent concealed Relation by the inferior constrictor. Laterally, it touches the carotid sheath; Fig. 29.* and its origin is beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual artery passing between the two.

The superior constrictor is thinner than the others, and of a ] quadrilateral form. It has a broad origin from the following parts in succession, commencing above,—the lower end of the internal pterygoid plate and the hamular process, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, the hinder part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and the side of the tongue. The fibres pass backwards, and are inserted by joining those of the fellow muscle along the middle bine, where a tendinous raphe" is formed between the two for the upper half of their depth. Some of the highest fibres end on the aponeiu'osis of the pharynx. The parts in contact with this muscle externally are the deep vessels and nerves of the neck at the side, the middle constrictor and prevertebral muscles behind : internally are the aponeurosis of the pharynx and the palato-pharyngeus muscle. The upper border forms an arch with the concavity upwards extending from the pterygoid plate to the basilar process ; and the space between it and the base of the skull is occupied by the aponeurosis of the pharynx, which projects outwards above the muscle, and by the levator palati, Eustachian tube and inferior palatine artery. The attachment to the pterygo-maxillary ligament corresponds with the origin of the buccinator muscle (i). Action of constrictors. The muscles of both sides contracting at' the same time will diminish the size of the pharynx ; and as the anterior attachments of the lower muscles are nearer together than those of the upper, the tube will be contracted more behind the larynx than near the head. In swallowing, the object is first seized by the lower part of the upper constrictor, and then forced on to the oesophagus by the sue-' cessive action of the middle and inferior constrictors. Since the back of the pharynx is closely applied to the prevertebral muscles, from which it cannot be separated in the natural condition of the parts, the effect of the contraction of these muscles is to draw the tongue, hyoid bone and larynx backwards, as well as somewhat upwards owing to the oblique direction of the greater number of the fibres of the middle and lower constrictors ; and the cavity, when empty, is compressed from before backwards. The upper part of the superior constrictor narrows the space- above the mouth, and assists in bringing together the posterior pillars of the soft palate. (See the action of the palato-pharyn- geus.) Dissectim. By dividing the middle and inferior constrictor* midway between their origin and insertion, and reflecting the parts forwards and backwards, the longitudinal fibres of the pharyngeal wall will be exposed. The longitudinal or elevator muscles of the pharynx are the stylo-pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus. The styloyharyngcus has already been described, but it may now be followed to its insertion (p. 102).

The INTERIOR OP THE PHARYNX (fig. 30) is wider from side to side Interior of ,han from before back, and its greatest width is opposite the hyoid Pharvnx )one; from that spot it diminishes both upwards and downwards, jut much more rapidly in the latter direction. In it the following jbjects are to be noticed. At the top are situate the posterior apertures (g) of the nasal objects to 'ossse, which are separated by the septum nasi. Below them hangs ;he soft palate, partly closing the opening into the mouth ; and from ts free margin a prominent fold of the mucous membrane, the posterior pillar of the soft palate (l), is continued downwards and backwards on the side of the pharynx. Immediately behind each oasal aperture is the trumpet-shaped end of the Eustachian tube; and Prom the anterior extremity of the prominence formed by the tube, i ridge descends to join the posterior pillar of the palate. Behind the opening of the Eustachian tube the mucous membrane is prolonged into a deep recess, which corresponds to the projection of the aponeurosis of the pharynx seen externally (p. 124). On raising the soft palate, the opening into the mouth—isthmus faucium (h), is exposed, bounded laterally by a mucous fold which descends to the tongue and is named the anterior pillar of the soft palate; while between the anterior and posterior pillars on each side is a hollow containing the tonsil (k). Next in order, below the mouth, comes the aperture of the larynx (n) with the epiglottis, the valve which closes the opening during deglutition, projecting above it. Lowest of all is the opening (o) from the pharynx into the oesophagus. The apertures into the pharynx are seven in number, and have Seven aper- the following position and boundaries :— tures' V1Z"~ The posterior openings of the nasal fossa; (g) are oval in form, and Posterior measure about an inch from above down, but only half an inch nares" across. Each is constructed in the dried skull by the sphenoid, with the vomer and palate bones above, and by the palate below ; by the vomer internally, and by the internal pterygoid plate on the outer side. The Eustachian tube (f) is a canal, partly osseous, partly cartila- Eustachian :ginous, by which the tympanic cavity of the ear communicates with tube; the external air. If thft mucous membrane be removed from the tube on the right Xw^ni't side, the cartilaginous part is seen to be nearly an inch long.

It is bounded above by t1'"fauces" the soft palate, below by the tongue, and on the sides by the anterior pillars of the soft palate. Its size varies with the move- ments of these parts, and it can be closed by the meeting of the soft palate and the tongue. The aperture of the larynx (n) is wide in front, where it is Upper bounded by the epiglottis, and pointed behind between the aryte- ^yn"" ° noid cartilages. The sides are sloped from before back, and are formed by folds (aryteno-epiglottidean) of the mucous membrane extending between the arytenoid cartilages and the epiglottis. Behind it is limited by the cornicula laryngis, and by the aryte- noid muscle covered by mucous membrane. During respiration this aperture is unobstructed, but in the act of deglutition it is closed by the epiglottis. The opening into the oesophagus (o) is the narrowest part of the Beginning of pharynx, and is opposite the cricoid cartilage and the sixth cervical ces°1'iasu°" vertebra. At this spot the mucous membrane in the cesophagus becomes paler than in the pharynx; and the point at which the pharynx ends is marked externally by a slight contraction, and by a change in the direction of the muscular fibres. The cavity of the pharynx is divided into three parts, which Subdivision differ in their function with regard to the transmission of the food pharynx7 °' and air. The upper or nasal portion is limited below by the softiuto nasa'> palate and its posterior pillars ; it gives passage only to air, and is always open. The middle or oral portion extends downwards to oral, the aperture of the larynx, and is traversed by both food and air ; it is open when breathing through the mouth, but closed when breathing solely through the nose, the aperture of the larynx then corresponding to the interval between the posterior pillars. The third part being behind the larynx is termed laryngeal, and only and laryn- transmits food; its walls are naturally in contact, except during films1'0'' the act of deglutition. The soft palate (velum pendulum palati, q) is a moveable Soft palate structure between the mouth and the pharynx, which can either mouthV ' close the opening of the mouth, or cut off the communication with the nose, according as it is depressed or elevated. In the usual surfaces, position of the soft palate (the state of relaxation) its anterior surface is concave, and is continuous with the roof of the mouth ; while the opposite surface is convex and turned to the pharynx.

The anterior pillar (i) springs from the anterior surface of the soft palate near the base of the uvula, and reaches to the side of the tongue rather behind the middle ; and the posterior (l), longer than the other, is continued from the lower border of the velum to the side of the pharynx. As they diverge from their origin to their"termination, they limit a triangular space in which the tonsil lies. The soft palate consists of an aponeurosis, with muscles, vessels, nerves, and mucous glands; and the whole is enveloped by the mucous membrane. Dissection. Some of the muscles of the palate are readily dis- played* but others require care in their dissection. On the right side the two principal muscles of the soft palate— the elevator and tensor, are very plain. These have already been partly dissected ; but to follow them to their tennination, let the itpper attachment of the pharynx on the right side, and the part of the superior constrictor which arises from the internal ptery- goid plate be cut through. The levator will be fully laid bare by the removal of the mucous membrane and a few muscular fibres covering its lower end. The tendon of the tensor palati should be followed round the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate ; and its situation in the palate beneath the levator should be made evident. The position of the Eustachian tube with respect to those muscles should also be ascertained. On the left side, the mucous membrane is to be raised with great care from the posterior siuface of the soft palate, to obtain a view of the superficial muscular fibres. Immediately beneath the mucous covering are some fine transverse fibres of the palato-pharyngeus muscle ; and beneath them, close to the middle line, are the longi- tudinal fibres of the azygos uvula;. A slender muscular bundle contained in the ridge of mucous membrane descending from the extremity of the Eustachian tube is to be exposed and traced to its junction with the palato-pharyngeus. On the right side, a deeper set of fibres of the palato-pharyngeus is to be followed beneath the levator and azygos muscles. The student shoidd remove next the mucous membrane from the muscular fibres contained in the arches of the palate, and should follow these upwards and downwards. In order to see those in the anterior fold, it will be necessary to take the membrane from the anterior surface of the palate. If the part is not tolerably fresh, some of the paler fibres may not be visible. Aponeurosis of the soft palate. Giving strength to the velum is a thin but firm aponeurosis, which is attached to'the hard palate. This membrane becomes thinner as it descends in the velum ; and it is joined by the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. The muscles OF the soft palate are, on each side, an elevator and tensor, which descend from the skull, with the palatoglossus129 MUSCLES OP PALATE. and palato-pharyngeus, which act as depressors, and a small median azygos muscle. The levator palati (fig. 30, A; 31,3) is a thick roundish Elevator muscle which is partly situate outside the pharynx. It arises from arises'6 the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone outside close in front of the carotid foramen, and from the lower border of the adjacent cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube. Enter- and is lost ing the pharynx above the superior constrictor, the fibres of the m velum- muscle spread out in the soft palate, where they join along the middle line with those of the muscle of the opposite side.

It raises the soft palate from the tongue, so as to Fig. 31. enlarge the fauces ; and by bringing the hinder part of the velum into contact with the posterior wall of the pharynx, it can shut off the upper part of that cavity, as in vocalization, when the air is prevented from passing through the nose. The tensor or circcmflexus palati (fig. 30, b ; 31,2) is a thin Tensor flattened muscle, lying immediately behind the internal pterygoid muscle plate. About an inch wide at its origin, it is attached to the JJ™^ scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, to the pharynx, outer side of the Eustachian tube, and to the spinous process of the sphenoid. The fleshy fibres end below in a tendon, which turns round the hamular process, and is inserted into a ridge close inserted into to the posterior border of the hard palate, and blends inferiorly of soft10"'8 with the aponeurosis of the velum. palate.

Use ; in swallow- ing; palati internally. The tendon enters the pharynx between the attachments of the buccinator muscle, and is thrown into folds as it winds round the hamular process, a bursa being placed between the two. In the soft palate it lies between the palato-pharyngeus and palato-glossus. Action. Acting from the skull the muscle will fix and make tense the soft palate ; but its movements will be very limited, seeing that the tendon is inserted partly into the palate bone. The soft palate being fixed by its depressor muscles, the tensor, taking its fixed point below, opens the Eustachian tube in swallowing. The palato-glossus muscle (constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small, pale band of fibres, which is contained in the anterior pillar (fig. 30, i) of the soft palate. It is connected below with the side of the tongue ; from this spot the fibres ascend in front of the tonsil to the anterior aspect of the soft palate, where they form a thin muscular stratum, and join those of the fellow muscle along the middle line. At its origin the muscle is blended with the glossal muscles, and at its insertion it is placed beneath the tensor palati. Action. The palato-glossus closes the isthmus of the fauces, bringing the soft palate into contact with the tongue, and approxi- mating the anterior pillars, thus shutting off the mouth from the pharynx. The palato-phaeyngeus (fig. 30, q ; 31, 4) is much larger than the preceding muscle, and gives rise to the eminence of the pos- terior pillar (l) of the soft palate. It begins in the soft palate in two layers, which enclose between them the levator palati and azygos uvulae muscles. The superficial, very thin, and situate immediately beneath the nmcous membrane, meets in the middle line the corresponding part of the opposite muscle ; it is also joined by a slender fasciculus, which descends from the anterior extremity of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube (salpingo-pharyn- geus—Santorini, fig. 30, c). The deep or anterior layer is much stronger, and lies between the levator and tensor palati muscles ; its upper fibres spring from the hinder margin of the hard palate and the aponeurosis of the velum, while the lower ones join those of the opposite side. The two layers meet at the outer part of the soft palate, and the muscle descends behind the tonsil on the side wall of the pharynx. Spreading out below, the anterior fibres are inserted into the hinder border of the thyroid cartilage, but the greater number end in the submucous tissue of the pharynx beneath the inferior constrictor, the hinder ones meeting the fellow muscle in the middle line. Action. The palato-pharyngeus depresses and tightens the soft palate, raises the larynx and lower part of the pharynx, and at the same time brings together the posterior pillars of the fauces, thus acting as a sphincter by which the nasal portion is separated from the oral portion of the pharynx. In swallowing, the hinder pillars of the soft palate, being approximated by the action of this muscle, form,THE TONSIL. 131 together with the uvula, an inclined plane, beneath which the food is directed downwards. The contraction of the salpingo-pharyngeus of salpingo- at the same time assists in opening the Eustachian tube, by drawing Pnarynseus- inwards and backwards the cartilage bounding its orifice. The aztgos uvuLffi (fig. 30, d ; 31,1) is situate along the middle ^s0|.. line of the velum near the posterior surface. The muscle consists two slips, of two narrow slips of pale fibres, which arise from the spine at the posterior border of the hard palate, or from the contiguous aponeu- rosis, and end below in the base of the uvula. Behind this muscle, separating it from the mucous membrane, is the thin stratum of the palato-pharyngeus. Action. Its fibres shorten the mid-part of the soft palate, and Use. elevate the uvula, directing that process backwards. The tonsil is an oval prominent body, of variable size, placed £°"silens above the root of the tongue, in a recess between the anterior and pilars of posterior pillars of the soft palate. Externally it is covered by the fauces> superior constrictor muscle, and is opposite the angle of the lower angiePoPf°Slte jaw. When enlarged it may extend backwards and press against jaw. the internal carotid artery. The surface of the tonsil is marked by apertures, which lead into structure, recesses lined by mucous membrane. Its substance consists mainly of lymphoid tissue, partly diffused, and partly collected into follicles set round the walls of these recesses. A similar collection of lym- pharyngeal phoid tissue stretches across the 'posterior wall of the pharynx, tonsi1- between the openings of the Eustachian tubes, and is known as the pharyngeal tonsil (Luschka). The arteries of the tonsil are numerous, and are derived from the Vessels, facial, lingual, ascending pharyngeal and internal maxillary branches of the external carotid. Its veins have a plexiform arrangement on the outer side. Nerves are furnished to it from the fifth and glosso- and nerves, pharyngeal. Its lymphatics join the deep cervical glands. The mucous membrane of the pluirynx is continuous in front with Mucous the lining of the nose, mouth and larynx. A fold encloses the JSynx.ie°f muscles and glands of the soft palate, from which the membrane descends on each side over the tonsil to the tongue. It is also pro- longed by the Eustachian tube to the tympanum ; and below, it is continued into the oesophagus. It is provided with numerous Glands, mucous glands in the upper part of the pharynx, and on both sur- faces, but especially the upper, of the soft palate. Another collec- tion of glands (arytenoid) is enclosed in the fold of mucous mem- brane bounding the opening of the larynx on each side. The Epithelium, epithelium is columnar and ciliated above the soft palate, but scaly and stratified below that part. Beginning of the oesophagus.

Section XII. Mouth. Form, and bounda- ries. Vestibule. Lining of the mouth differs in parts: on roof, floor, cheek, and lips. CAVITY OF THE MOUTH. The cheeks, the lips, and the teeth are to be examined with the mouth, as all may be considered accessory parts. Mouth. The cavity of the mouth extends from the lips in front to the anterior pillars of the fauces behind. Its boundaries are partly osseous and partly muscular, and its size depends upon the position of the lower jaw-bone. When the lower jaw is mode- rately removed from the upper, the mouth is an oval cavity with the following boundaries. The roof, concave, is constituted by the hard and soft palate, and is limited in front and on the sides by the arch of the teeth. In the floor is the tongue, surrounded by the arch of the lower teeth ; and beneath that body is the sublingual gland on each side. Each lateral boundary consists of the cheek and the ramus of the lower jaw ; and in it, near the second molar tooth in the upper jaw, is the opening of the parotid duct. The anterior opening of the mouth is bounded by the lips ; and the posterior is the isthmus faucium (p. 127), leading into the pharynx. The space between the lips and the teeth is often distinguished from the rest of the cavity as the vestibule of the mouth. The mucous membrane is less sensitive on the hard than tbe soft boundaries of the mouth ; it lines the interior of the cavity, and is reflected over the tongue. In front it is continuous with the skin, and behind with the lining of the pharynx. The epithelium cover- ing the membrane is scaly and stratified. Between each lip and the front of the corresponding jaw the membrane forms a small fold.—frsenidum. Over the bony part of the roof it blends with the dense tissue enclosing the vessels and nerves; on the soft palate it is smooth, and thinner. Along the middle of the roof is a slightly raised raphe", which ends in front opposite the anterior palatine fossa in a small papilla ; and on each side of this, at the fore part of the hard palate, there are two or three irregular transverse ridges. In the floor of the mouth the membrane forms the fraenum linguae beneath the tip of the tongue, and on each side of the fraenum it is raised into a ridge by the sub- lingual gland, at the fore part of which is a small papilla, perforated by the opening of Wharton's duct. On the interior of the cheek and Hps the mucous lining is smooth, and is separated from the muscles by small buccal and labial glands.THE CHEEK AND LIPS. 133 Over the whole cavity, but especially on the lips and tongue, are Papilla, papillas for the purpose of toiich.

The chief constituent of the and struc- cheek is the fleshy buccinator muscle : on the inner surface of this is ture" the mucous membrane ; and on the outer the integuments, with some muscles, vessels, and nerves. The parotid duct perforates the cheek obliquely near the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The lips surround the opening of the mouth; they are formed Lips, mainly by the orbicularis oris muscle, covered externally by integu- formed by ment, and internally by mucous membrane. The lower lip is the ocularis, larger and more • moveable of the two. Between the muscular structure and the mucous covering lie the labial glands ; and in the substance of each lip, internal to the muscular structure, and at the Line of junction of the two portions of the orbicularis, is placed the contain arch of the coronary arteries. arteries. Teeth. In the adidt there are sixteen teeth in each jaw, which Teeth, are set in the alveolar borders in the form of an arch, and are sur- arrangement rounded by the gums. Each dental arch has its convexity turned in jaw. forwards; and, commonly, the arch in the maxilla overhangs that in the mandible when the jaws are in contact. The teeth are similar in the half of each jaw, and have received the following names :—the most anterior two are incisors, and the one next behind is the canine tooth; two, still farther back, are the bicuspids ; and the last three are molar teeth. For details as to the form and structure of the teeth reference must be made to a work on syste- matic or general anatomy. Section XIII. DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. To obtain a view of the interior of the nose, it will be necessary Directions, to make a vertical longitudinal section through the nasal cavity. While the student is examining the boundaries of the nose he will derive advantage from the use of a vertical section of a macerated skull. Dissection. Before sawing the bone, the loose part of the lower Dissection, jaw on the right side shoidd be taken away, and the tongue, hyoid bone, and larynx, all rmited, are to be detached from the opposite half of the lower jaw, and laid aside till the dissector is ready to use them.

Then hy sawing through the hard palate and the alveolar process of the upper jaw along the same line, the piece of the skull will he separated into two parts, right and left; the right half will serve for the examination of the meatuses, and the left will show the septum nasi, after the mucous membrane has been removed. The cavity of the nose is placed in the centre of the bones of the face, being situate above the mouth, below the cranium, and between the orbits. This space is divided into two nasal fossa? by a vertical partition. Each fossa . is larger below than above, and is compressed laterally, so that its diameter from before back or from above down much exceeds that from within out. It communicates with both the face and the pharynx by openings named nares ; and it has also apertures of communication with the sinuses in the surrounding bones, viz., frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and superior maxillary. Each fossa presents for examination a roof and floor, an inner and outer wall, and an anterior and posterior opening. The roof is strongly arched from before back, and is formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone in the centre ; by the frontal and nasal bones, and the cartilages in front ; and by the body of the sphenoid, with the sphenoidal spongy bone, and the palate bone, at the posterior part. In the dried skull many apertures exist in it; most are in the ethmoid bone for the branches of the olfactory nerve with vessels, and one for the nasal nerve and vessels ; on the front of the body of the sphenoid is the opening of its sinus. The floor is slightly hollowed from side to side, and is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones. Near the front in the dry skull is the incisor foramen leading to the anterior palatine fossa. The inner wall (septum nasi) is partly osseous and partly cartila- ginous. The osseous part is constructed by the vomer, by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and by those parts of the frontal and nasal with which this last bone articulates. The angidar space in front in the prepared skull is filled in the recent state by the cartilage of the septum, which forms part of the parti- tion between the nostrils, and supports the lateral cartilages. Fixed between the vomer, the ethmoid, and the nasal bones, this cartilage rests in front on the incisor crest of the superior maxilla?, and projects between the cartilages of the nostrils. The septum nasi is commonly bent to one side. The outer wall has the greatest extent and the most irregular surface. Seven bones enter into its formation, and they come in the following order from before backwards :—the nasal and superior maxillary ; the small lachrymal bone and the lateral mass of the ethmoid, with the inferior turbinate bone below these ; and posteriorly the ascending part of the palate bone, with the internalSPONGY BONES AND MEATUSES. 135 pterygoid plate of the sphenoid ; of these, the nasal, lachrymal, and formed of ethmoid reach only about half way from roof to floor, and the mauy °nes' inferior turbinate is confined to the lower half, while the others extend the whole depth. In front of the bones, the lateral cartilages complete this boundary. Prom this wall three slightly convoluted osseous plates, named is irregular turbinate or spongy bones (fig. 32), project into the cavity :—the °"es^.oe' upper (') and middle (2) are processes of the ethmoid, but the lower spongy one (3) is a separate bone. The turbinate bones are confined to that bones portion of the outer wall which is situate above the hard palate. ,a^d hollows Between each turbinate bone and the wall of the nose is a longitudinal hollow or meatus; and into these hollows the nasal duct and the sinuses of the surrounding bones open. The meatuses are the spaces arched over by the spongy bones ; and Meatuses, as the bones are limited to a certain part of the outer wall, so are the spaces beneath them. The upper meatus (fig. 32,6) is the smallest and straightest of the Upper three, and is limited to the posterior half of the space above the meatus- hard palate. Into its fore part the posterior ethmoidal cells open ; and at its posterior end, in the dried skull, is the spheno-palatine foramen by which nerves and vessels enter the nose. The middle meatus (fig. 32,') is longer than the upper, reaching Middle from the posterior opening of the nasal fossa, nearly as far forwards meatus- Outer wall of the nasal cavity. 1.

The free border of the middle turbinate bone being curved upwards anteriorly, this meatus is open in front as well as below. On raising the overhanging turbinate bone, a deep groove will be seen in the fore part of the lateral wall of the meatus, bounded below by the uncinate process of the ethmoid, and leading upwards through the infundibulum of the latter bone to the frontal sinus. Into the groove lower down the anterior ethmoidal cells open, and at its hindmost part is a small aperture leading into the antrum of the superior maxilla. In some cases there is a second opening into the antrum close above the lower turbinate bone. The inferior meatus (fig. 32,8) is wider than the middle one, and extends the whole length of the hard palate. Near its anterior extremity is the opening of the nasal duct. Occasionally there is a small rudimentary or fourth meatus above the superior turbinate bone (fig. 32,3), which communicates with a posterior ethmoidal cell. The nam. In the recent condition of the nose each fossa has a distinct anterior opening on the face, and another in the pharynx ; but in the skeleton there is only one common opening in front for both sides. These apertures and their boundaries have been before described (pp. 30 and 125). The mucous lining of the nasal fossa is called the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane, and is blended with the subjacent perios- teum or perichondrium. It is continuous with the skin at the nostril, with the membrane lining the pharynx through the posterior naris, and with the conjunctiva through the nasal duct; and it sends prolongations to line the different sinuses, viz., frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary. The apertures in the dry bone winch transmit nerves and vessels, viz., the incisor and spheno-palatine foramina, the holes in the cribriform plate, and the foramen for the nasal nerve and vessels, are entirely closed by the membrane ; and the openings leading to the sinuses are reduced in size by the prolongations passing through them. At the termination of the nasal duct the mucous mem- brane forms a single or double fold, which is sometimes sufficient to close the opening and prevent air entering the canal from the nose. Over the middle and lower turbinate bones, and to a greater extent on the latter, the mucous membrane is thickened and pro- jected beyond the edges of the bones by the large submucous vessels, so that the meatuses are deeper and longer in the recent state than in the dried skull. The. appearance and structure of the Hning membrane differ in the upper and lower parts of the nasal fossa, and near the anterior opening, whence a division of the cavity is made into three portions, which are termed respectively the olfactory region, the respiratory region, and the vestibule. The vestibule (fig. 32,10) is the slightly dilated portion of the cavity immediately within the nostril. It is bounded by the cartilage of the aperture and the ala of the nose ; and its wall isOLFACTORY REGION AND NERVES. 137 more flexible than that of the part above. The lining membrane of the vestibule has the characters of the outer skin, being furnished with papilla? and hairs (vibrissas), and lined by a stratified scaly epithelium. The respiratory region is the part below the level of the middle Respiratory turbinate bone. Its mucous membrane is thick, of a red colour, res;ion- very vascular, and has numerous mucous glands, the openings of which are readily seen on the surface. The glands are largest and most abundant on the inferior turbinate bone, and at the lower and back part of the cavity. The epithelium of this region is columnar and ciliated. The olfactory region is the narrowed upper part of the nasal fossa, olfactory which is enclosed by the ethmoid bone. It comprises the part of region, the roof formed by the cribriform plate, the part of the septum (about one-third) formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and, on the outer wall, the upper and middle turbinate bones, together with the flat surface of the lateral mass of the ethmoid in front of the former. Over this region the olfactory nerves are dis- tributed, and it is, therefore, the seat of the sense of smell. The olfactory mucous membrane is thinner, softer, and less vascular than that in the respiratory region, and it has in the fresh state a yellowish colour. Its epithelium is columnar, but not ciliated ; and it is thickly beset with simple tubular glands. In the sinuses the mucous lining is thin and pale, and its glands Mucous are few and small. membrane Dissection. At this stage of the dissection, but little will be dissection seen of the distribution of the olfactory nerves. If the septum be of nerves removed, so as to leave entire the membrane covering it on the left side, the nervous filaments will appear on the surface, near the cribriform plate. In the membrane, near the front of the septum, an offset of the nasal nerve is to be found. The naso-palatine nerve and artery (fig. 33,3) are to be sought lower down, as they are directed from behind forwards, towards the anterior palatine fossa ; the artery is readily seen, especially if it is injected, but the fine nerve is embedded in the membrane, and will be found by scraping with the point of the scalpel. By cutting through the fore and upper part of the membrane detached from the septum nasi, other branches of the olfactory nerve may be traced on the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The olfactory nerves spring from the under surface of the olfactory olfactory bulb as it lies on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone nerves, (fig. 33,1), and descend to the olfactory region of the nose through the apertures in this part of the roof. They are about twenty in number, and are divided into two sets. Those of the inner set are inner set, the larger, and run downwards in the grooves on the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, to be distributed over the upper third of the septum. The outer set (fig. 34) ramifies over the upper turbinate outer sot. bone, the flat surface of the ethmoid in front of this, and the fore part of the middle turbinate bone. As the nerves leave the skull, they receive sheaths from the dura mater and pia mater, which areDISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 138 continued as far as their terminal ramifications, and then hecome lost in the surrounding tissue.

The branches are first to be sought, and these are then to be followed to the ganglion and main trunk. Dissection. The left half of the head is to be used for the dis- Dissection play of the ganglion and its branches ; but the student will derive advantage from first attempting the dissection on the remains of the right side. To lay bare the branches to the palate, detach the soft parts in of palatine the roof of the mouth from the bone, until the nerves and vessels and escaping from the posterior palatine canals are arrived at. Cut off, with the bone forceps, the posterior part of the hard palate to a level with the vessels and nerves ; and cleaning these, trace offsets behind into the soft palate, and follow the main pieces forwards to the front of the mouth. Take away, without injury to the naso-palatine nerve and vessels j^£ci,es. (already found), the hinder portion of the loose piece of mucous membrane detached from the septum nasi; and separate the mucous membrane from the outer wall of the nasal fossa, behind the spongy bones, as high as the spheno-palatine foramen. In reflecting for- wards the membrane many branches of vessels and nerves will be seen entering it through the foramen ; but these may be left for the present, and directions for their dissection will be subsequently given. When the lining membrane of the nose has been removed behind the spongy bones, the palatine nerves and vessels will appear through the thin translucent palate bone, and may be readily reached by breaking carefully through the latter with a chisel. Afterwards, the tube of membrane containing the palatine vessels and nerves being opened, these are to be followed down to the soft palate and the roof of the mouth, and upwards to the ganglion which is close to the body of the sphenoid bone. To bring the ganglion fully into view, it will be necessary to saw botly .of through the overhanging body of the sphenoid bone, to cut away gang' ' pieces of the bones surrounding the hollow in which it lies, and to remove with care the enveloping fat and the periosteum. The ganglion then appears as a flattened reddish-looking body, from which the Vidian and pharyngeal nerves pass backwards. Besides the branches referred to, the student should seek two large nerves from the top of the ganglion to join the superior maxillary trunk, and smaller offsets to the floor of the orbit. To trace backwards the Vidian branch to the carotid plexus and Vidian the facial nerve, the student must lay open the canal which contains nerve' it and its artery in the root of the pterygoid process ; and in doing this he must define the small pharyngeal branches of nerve and artery which are superficial to the Vidian, and lie in the pterygo- palatine canal. At the back of the Vidian canal, a small branch from the nerve to the plexus on the internal carotid artery is to be looked for. Lastly, the prolongation of the Vidian nerve (large superficial petrosal) is to be followed into the skull through the dense tissue in the foramen lacerum, after cutting away the point ofDISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 140 Seek branches to the nose.

The branches of the internal maxillary artery with the nerves are to be cleaned at the same time. The spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion (fig. 34,') lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa, close to the spheno-palatine foramen, and is connected with the branches of the superior maxillary nerve to the palate. The ganglionic mass is somewhat triangular in form, and of a reddish grey colour. It is situate, for the most part, behind the branches (spheno-palatine) of the superior maxillary nerve, so as to surround only some of their fibres; and it is pro- longed posteriorly into the Vidian nerve. Meckel's ganglion re- sembles the other ganglia in connection with the fifth nerve in having sensory, motor, and sympathetic offsets or roots connected with it. The branches of the ganglion are distributed chiefly to the nose and palate, but small offsets are given to the pharynx and the orbit. Other oft'sets or roots connect it with siu-rounding nerves. Branches to the nose. The nasal branches, from three to five in number, are very small and soft, and pass inwards through the spheno-palatine foramen; they are distributed in the nose and the roof of the mouth. The superior nasal branches ramify in the mucous membrane on the two upper spongy bones, and a few filaments reach the back part of the septum nasi. The naso-palatine nerve (nerve of Cotunnius—fig. 33,3) crosses the roof of the nasal fossa to reach the septum, on which it descends to near the front of that partition. In the floor of the nose it enters a special canal by the side of the septum, the left being anterior to the right, and is conveyed to the roof of the mouth, where it lies in the centre of the anterior palatine fossa. Finally, the nerves of opposite sides are distributed in the mucous membrane behind the incisor teeth, and communicate with one another. On the septum nasi filaments are supplied by the naso-palatine nerve to the mucous membrane. To follow the nerve to its termination, the canal in the roof of the mouth must he opened. Branches to the palate. The nerves of the palate, though con- nected in part with the ganglionic mass, are the continuation of the spheno-palatine branches of the superior maxillary nerve (p. 100). Below the ganglion they are divided into three—large, small, and external. The large or anterior palatine nerve (fig. 34,°) reaches the roof ofHI SPHENOPALATINE GANGLION. the mouth through the largest palatine canal, and courses forwards £0as2™chos nearly to the incisor teeth, where it joins the naso-palatine nerve. While in the canal, the nerve furnishes two or more filaments (inferior nasalj) to the membrane on the middle and lower spongy- bones ; in the roof of the mouth it supplies the mucous membrane and glands, and gives an offset to the soft palate. The small or posterior palatine nerve (10) lies in the smaller canal, small; and and ends inferiorly in the soft palate, the uvula, and the tonsil. It is said to supply the levator palati and azygos uvulae muscles. The external palatine nerve is smaller than the other two, and external descends in the canal of the same name to be distributed to the pa a me- velum palati and the tonsil. The pharyngeal branch is very small, and is directed through the pharyngeal Fig. 34.* pterygopalatine canal to supply the mucous membrane of the pharynx near the Eustachian tube. Branches to the orbit. Two or three in number, these ascend Orbital through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and end in the periosteum and orbital muscle (p. 50). It will be necessary to cut through the sphenoid bone to follow these nerves to their termination. Connecting branches. The ganglion is united, as before said, with Uniting the spheno-palatine branches of the fifth nerve (fig. 34,'), receiving braucnes' sensory fibres through them; and through the medium of the ' Vidian, which is described below, it communicates with a motor nerve (facial), and with the sympathetic nerve. * Nerves of the outer wall of the nose and of the palate. 1.

Seek other nerves and vessels of nose. Nasal nerve lies beneath nasal bone ; gives branch to septum and to outer wall. Branches of internal maxillary artery are palatine branch; The Vidian nerve (8) passes backwards through the Vidian canal, and sends some small filaments through the bone to the membrane at the hack of the roof of the nose (upper posterior nasal branches). At its exit from the canal, the nerve receives a soft reddish offset (large deep petrosal nerve) from the sympathetic on the outer side of the carotid artery. The continuation of the nerve enters the craniivm through the foramen lacerum, and is directed backwards in a groove on the surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone, where it takes the name of large superficial petrosal nerve (fig. 35,2). Lastly it is continued through the hiatus Fallopii, to join the gangli- form enlargement on the facial nerve (p. 145). While in the tem- poral bone, the large superficial petrosal receives a twig froni the tympanic nerve. The Vidian nerve is supposed to consist of motor and sym- pathetic fibres in the same sheath, as in the connecting branches between the sympathetic and spinal nerves. Directions. The student may now give his attention to the remaining nerves in the nasal cavity. Dissection. The nasal nerve is to be sought behind the nasal bone (fig. 34) by gently detaching the lining membrane, after having cut off the projecting bone. A branch is given from the nerve to the septum, but probably this, and the trunk of the nerve, will be seen but imperfectly in the present condition of the part. The terminal branches of the internal maxillary arteiy in the spheno-maxillary fossa have been laid bare in the dissection of Meckel's ganglion, but they may be now completely traced out. The nasal nerve (of the ophthalmic) (fig. 34/') has been already seen in the skull and orbit. Entering the nasal fossa by an aperture at the front of the ethmoid bone, the nerve gives a branch to the membrane of the septum, and then descends in a groove on the back of the nasal bone. At the lower margin of the latter it escapes between the bone and the upper lateral cartilage to the surface of the nose (p. 44). Branches. The branch to the septum (fig. 33) divides into fila- ments that ramify on the anterior part of that partition, and reach nearly to the lower border. One or two filaments are likewise furnished by the nerve to the mucous membrane on the outer wall of the nasal fossa; these extend as low as the inferior spongy bone. Terminal branches op the internal maxillary artery. The branches of the artery in the spheno-maxillary fossa, which have not been examined, are the superior palatine, nasal, pterygo- palatine, and Vidian. The superior or descending palatine is the largest branch, and accompanies the large palatine nerve through the canal, and along the roof of the mouth ; it anastomoses behind the incisor teeth with its fellow, and with the naso-palatine branch through the incisor foramen. This artery supplies offsets to the soft palate and tonsil through the other palatine canals, and some twigs are furnished to the lining membrane of the nose. In the roof of the mouth143 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. the mucous membrane, glands and gums receive their vessels from it. The nasal or sphenopalatine artery enters the nose through the Indies spheno-palatine foramen, and divides into branches. Some of these are distributed on the spongy bones, and the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and supply offsets to the posterior ethmoidal cells. One long branch, naso-palatine or artery of the septumnasi, runs on the partition one to sep- between the nasal fossae to the incisor foramen, through which ittum nasl' anastomoses with the superior palatine in the roof of the mouth ; this branch accompanies the naso-palatine nerve, and covers,the septum with numerous ramifications. The pterygopalatine is a very small branch which, passing back- pterygo- wards through the canal of the same name, is distributed to the branch"; lining membrane of the pharynx. The Vidian or pterygoid branch is contained in tbe Vidian canal Vidian with the nerve of the same name, and ends on the mucous mem- brancn< brane of the Eustachian tube and the upper part of the pharynx. Some small nasal arteries are furnished to the roof of the nasal other nasal fossa by the posterior ethmoidal branch of the ophthalmic (p. 46). arteries- Also the anteror ethmoidal (internal nasal, p. 46) enters the cavity with the nasal nerve, and ramifies in the lining membrane of the fore part of the nasal chamber as low as the vestibule ; a branch passes to the face between the nasal bone and the cartilage with the nerve. Other offsets from the facial artery supply the nose near the nostril. Veins. The veins accompanying the terminal branches of the in- Veins to ternal maxillary artery enter the alveolar plexus in the spheno- plexus^ maxillary fossa (p. 89). Beneath the mucous membrane of the nose the veins have a plexiform arrangement, as before said. Facial nerve in the temporal bone (fig. 35). This nerve Faciainerve. winds through the petrous part of the temporal bone ; and it is fol- lowed with difficulty in consequence of the extreme density of the bone, and the absence of marks on the sivrface to indicate its position. To render this dissection easier, the student should be provided with a temporal bone, in which the course of the facial nerve and the cavity of the tympanum are displayed. Dissection. The trunk of the nerve is to be found as it leaves the Dissection stylo-mastoid foramen, and from this point it is to be foUowed up- ^"bole wards through the temporal bone. With this view, the side of the skull should be sawn through vertically between the meatus audi- torius externus and the anterior border of the mastoid process, so as to open the lower part of the aqueduct of Fallopius from behind. The nerve will be then seen entering deeply into the substance of the temporal bone ; and it can be followed forwards by cutting away with the bone-forceps all the bone projecting above it. In this last step the cavity of the tympanum will be opened, and the chain of bones in it exposed. The nerve is to be traced onwards along the inner side of the and its tympanum, until it becomes enlarged, and bends suddenly inwards B°nu;DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 144 of chorda tympani; and other branches.

The surrounding bone is to be removed from the enlargement, so as to allow of the petrosal nerves and the internal meatus is to be laid open, to being traced from it see the facial and auditory nerves in that canal. The course of the chorda tympani nerve (branch of the facial) across the tympanum will be brought into sight by the removal of the central ear bone, the incus. This nerve may be also followed to the facial through the wall of the cavity behind, as well as out of the cavity in front. The remaining branches of the facial nerve in the bone are very minute, and are not to be seen except on a fresh piece of the skull which has been softened in Fig. 35.* acid. The student may, therefore, omit the para- graphs marked with an aste- risk, until he is able to obtain a part on which a careful examination can be made. The facial nerve (fig. 35,1) traverses the internal auditory meatus, and entering the aqueduct of Fallopius at the bottom of that hollow, is conducted through the tem- poral bone to the stylo- mastoid foramen and the face (p. 36). In its serpentine course through the bone, the nerve is first directed out- wards to the inner wall of the tympanum; at that spot it bends backwards, and is marked by a ganglionic swelling—geniculate ganglion, with which several small nerves are united. From this swelling the nerve is continued at first backwards and then downwards through the arched aqueduct, to the aperture of exit from the bone. The branches of the nerve in the bone serve chiefly to connect it with other nerves; but one supplies the tongue, and another the stapedius muscle. * Connecting brandies unite the facial with the auditory and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, with Meckel's ganglion, and with the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. * Union with the auditory nerve.

This long but slender branch of the facial chorda nerve crosses the tympanum, and ends in the tongue. Arising to Ungual, about a quarter of an inch from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it enters the tympanum below the pyramid. In the cavity (fig. 35,*) the nerve is directed forwards across the handle of the malleus and the membrana tympani to an aperture on the inner side of the Glaserian fissure, through which it leaves the tympanum. Outside the skull the chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve, and continues along it to the submaxillary ganglion and the tongue (p. 98). The auditory nerve will be learnt with the ear. Entering the Auditory nerve internal auditory meatus with the facial nerve, it divides into an upper smaller, and a lower larger part, which are distributed to the membranous labyrinth. Otic ganglion. At this stage of the dissection there is little to Otic be seen of the ganglion, but the student should keep in mind that it is one of the things to be examined in a fresh part. Its situation is on the inner aspect of the inferior maxillary nerve, immediately below the foramen ovale, and it adheres closely to the trunk of the nerve. Dissection (fig. 36). Putting the part in the same position as for Dissection, the examination of Meckel's ganglion, the dissector should define the Eustachian tube and the muscles of the palate, and then take away the levator palati and the cartilaginous portion of the tube, using much care in removing the latter. When some loose areolar tissue has been cleared away, the internal pterygoid muscle (6) comes into view, with the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve above it; and a branch (internal pterygoid,5) descending from that nerve to the muscle. If the nerve to the pterygoid be taken as a guide, it will lead to the ganglion. To complete the dissection, saw vertically through the petrous to define part of the temporal bone near the inner wall of the tympanum, Snaps'" the bone being supported while it is divided. Taking off some branches, membrane which covers the ganglion, the student may follow back- wards a small branch to the tensor tympani muscle ; but he should open the small tube that contains the muscle, by entering it below through the carotid canal. Above this small branch there is another minute nerve (small superficial petrosal), which issues from the skull, and joins the back of the ganglion. A small twig is to be sought from the front of the ganglion to the tensor palatiDISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 146 muscle ; and other minute filaments to join the sympathetic nerve on the large meningeal artery and the chorda tympani. Oticgan- The otic ganglion (Arnold's ganglion, fig. 36) is a small reddish side of kody, which is situate on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve close to the skull, and surrounds the origin of the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle. By its inner surface the ganglion is in contact with the Eustachian tube, and at a little distance hehind lies the large meningeal artery. In this ganglion, as in the others connected with the fifth nerve, filaments from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves are blended. Some twigs are furnished hy it to muscles.

Dissection. The ends of the extrinsic lingual muscles that have Dissection, been detached on the right side may be shortened, but enough of each should be left to trace it afterwards into the substance of the tongue. The tongue is an ovoidal, somewhat flattened body, with the Tongue, larger end turned backwards, which occupies the floor of the mouth, Form and and forms a part of the anterior wall of the pharynx. It is free Sltuati0n- over the greater part of its surface ; but at the back, and at the posterior two-thirds of the under surface, it is attached by muscles and mucous membrane to the parts around. The tip of the tongue (apex) touches the incisor teeth. The base Relations of is attached to the hyoid bone, and is connected likewise with the and epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane—a central and two lateral. The upper surface or dorsum is convex, and in the anterior two- Upper thirds of its extent is marked by a median longitudinal groove or a e' raphe, which terminates behind in a depression of variable depth, named the foramen cacum. From the depression a slight lateral groove is directed outwards and forwards on each side for a short distance. The part of the tongue in front of the lateral grooves is Body, distinguished as the body, and is received into the hollow of the roof of the mouth : its surface is covered with papillae. The posterior third or root of the organ looks into the pharynx ; and its Boot, surface is smoother, although rendered somewhat irregular by projecting mucous glands and groups of lymphoid follicles, and by small apertures leading into recesses of the mucous membrane. Lo The under surface, free only in part, gives attachment to the mucous surface.148 DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. Borders. Kinds of papilla: : conical and liliform : fungiform : circumval- late. Parts found in tongue. Define septum, membrane and to the different lingual muscles connected with the hyoid bone and the jaw. In front of the muscles the mucous membrane forms a fold in the middle line, termed the frcenum linguce; and on each side an irregular ridge—plica fimbriuta (better seen in infants), runs forwards and inwards about midway between the fraenum and the margin of the tongue towards the tip. Each border of the tongue is joined opposite the lateral groove above mentioned bv the fold of mucous membrane descending from the soft palate, and known as the anterior pillar of the fauces. Behind this fold, the root of the tongue is attached on each side to the wall of the pharynx ; but in front, the margin of the body is free. The free border is thick and rounded in its hinder part, where it is marked by vertical ridges and furrows, and becomes gradually thinner towards the tip. Papilla. On the dorsum of the tongue are the following kinds of papillae ; the conical and filiform, the fungiform, and the circirmvallate. The conical and filiform papillce are the numerous small projec- tions which cover the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum of the tongue. They taper from the base towards the free extremity, where they are provided with smaller secondary papillae ; and many of them, especially towards the sides of the organ, have their epithelial covering produced into long hair-like processes, whence the name filiform is given to them. Towards their limit behind they are arranged in lines parallel to the lateral grooves, and on the sides they form vertical rows. The fungiform papilla! are less numerous but larger than the preceding set, amongst which they are scattered, especially at the tip and sides of the tongue. They are wider at the free end than at the part fixed to the tongue, and project beyond the conical papillae. Their surface is covered with small simple papillae. The circumvallate papilla! are much larger than the foregoing, and are placed at the junction of the middle and posterior thirds of the tongue. Their number varies from seven to twelve. One, larger than the rest, is situate immediately in front of the foramen caecum, and the others are disposed in two rows (one on each side) parallel to the lateral groove, so as to form a figure like a widely- spread letter V. Each papilla is attached by a constricted stem, which is surrounded by a groove : its wider end or base projects beyond the surface of the tongue, and is covered with small simple papillae. Around the groove the mucous membrane forms a slightly prominent fold, which is also beset with secondary papillae. Structure. The tongue consists of two symmetrical halves separated by a fibrous layer in the median plane. Each half is made up of muscular fibres with interspersed fat; and entering it are the lingual vessels and nerves. The tongue is enveloped by mucous membrane ; and a special fibrous layer attaches it to the hyoid bone. Dissection.

On the outer side of the genio-glossus muscle is the longitudinal *na inferior bundle of the inferior lingualis, which will be hetter seen suhse- cpaently. Fibrous tissue. Along the middle line of the tongue is placed a Fibrous st rue tuxes thin lamina of this tissue, forming a septum ; the root of the tongue 0f tongue, is attached by another fibrous structure, the hyo-glossal memhrane ; and covering the greater part of the organ in a submucous layer of the same tissue. Septum. This structure forms a vertical partition between the two Septum, halves of the tongue (fig. 38, b), and extends from the base to the apex, hut does not reach to the dorsum. It is thicker behind than in front, and is connected posteriorly with the hyo-glossal memhrane. To each side the transverse muscle is attached. Its disposition may he better seen subsequently on a vertical section. The hyo-glossal membrane is a thin but strong fibrous lamina, Hyo-glossal which attaches the root of the tongue to the upper border of the mem rane* body of the hyoid bone. On its under or anterior surface some of the hinder fibres of the genio-glossi are inserted, as if this was their aponeurosis to attach them to the hyoid bone. The submucous fibrous stratum of the tongue invests the organ, Submucous and is continued into the sheaths of the muscles. Over the yer" posterior third of the dorsum its strength is greater than elsewhere ; and in front of the epiglottis it forms hands in the folds of the mucous membrane in that situation. Into it are inserted the mus- cular fibres which end on the surface of the tongue. Muscles. Each half of the tongue is made up of extrinsic and Muscles in intrinsic muscles.

The piece of the constrictor muscle (g) which is attached to the tongue, and the ending of the genio-glossus will come into view on the division of the hyo-glossus. To lay bare the chondro-glossus (f), which is a small muscular slip attached to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, turn upwards the dorsum of the tongue, and feel for the small cornu of the hyoid through the mucous membrane. Then remove the mucous membrane in front of this, and the fibres of the muscle radiating forwards will be visible. The palatoglossus reaches the side of the tongue at the jimetion of the posterior and middle thirds. Its fibres are directed inwards, in part on the surface, and in part deeply with the transverse muscle to the septum. The stylo-glossus joins the body of the tongue below the foregoing, and is continued forwards as a gradually tapering bundle beneath the lateral margin to the tip of the organ, where it becomes united with the inferior lingualis, and meets the muscle of the opposite side. From its upper border fibres are directed inwards over the dorsum of the tongue to the middle line ; and other bundles pass inwards from its lower edge between the fasciculi of the hyo-glossus. The hyo-glossus enters the under surface of the tongue in its middle third, between the stylo-glossus and the inferior lingualis. Its fibres are collected into bundles which turn round the margin and form, with those of the preceding muscles, a layer on the dor- sum of the tongue, the hinder fibres passing almost transversely inwards, the anterior inclining forwards to the tip. The chondro-glossus is a small fan-shaped muscle, which arises from the lesser cornu and the adjacent part of the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres are directed forwards, spreading out beneath the mucous membrane of the posterior third of the tongue, and are inserted into the submucous layer. Cortex of the tongue.

To complete the preparation of the inferior lingualis f^^j0W on the right side, the fibres of the stylo-glossus covering it in front, and those of the hyo-glossus over it behind are to be cut through.

The muscle arises behind from the fascia at the root of the tongue ; and the fibres are collected into a roundish bundle : from its attached surface fasciculi are continued upwards through the transverse fibres to the dorsum ; and at the anterior third of the tongue, where the muscle is overlaid by the styloglossus, some of the fibres are applied to that muscle and distributed with it. Action. This muscle shortens the tongue, and bends the apex downwards. The intrinsic perpendicular fibres are found near the border of the fore part of the tongue, and can be seen only in transverse sections. They pass from the submucous tissue of the dorsum downwards and somewhat outwards, decussating with the cortical and transverse fibres, to the under surface. Action. By their contraction these fibres flatten and render broader the part of the tongue in which they occur. Medullary portion of the tongue. The central part of the tongue, which is thus named, is paler in colour and softer than the cortex. It is composed mainly of the bundles of the transverse muscle crossing the lamina? of the genio-glossus internally and the j)erpen- dicular fibres externally, together with interspersed fat. The mucous membrane of the tongue is a continuation of that lining the mouth, and is provided with a stratified scaly epithelium. It invests the greater part of the tongue, and is reflected off at different points in the form of folds (p. 148). At the epiglottis are three small glosso-epiglottidean folds, connecting this body to the root of the tongue ; the central one of these is called the frcenum of the epiglottis. It is furnished with numerous glands, and lymphoid crypts and follicles. The crypts are depressions of the mucous membrane, which are surrounded by lymphoid follicles in the submucous tissue, like the arrangement in the tonsil; they occupy the dorsum of the tongue between the circurnvallate papilla? and the epiglottis, where they form a stratum close beneath the mucous membrane. The lingual glands are racemose, similar to those of the lips and > cheek, and are placed beneath the mucous membrane on the dorsum of the tongue behind the circurnvallate papillae. A few are foundNERVES OF THE TONGUE. 153 iii front of the circunivallate papillae, where they project into the muscular substance. Some of their ducts open on the surface; others in the hollows around the circumvallate papillae, or into the foramen caecum and the depressions of the crypts. Opposite the circumvallate papillae, at the margin of the tongue, ^^g* is a small cluster of mucous glands. Under the tip of the tongue, ^a"-^'^ on each side of the fraenum, is another elongated collection of the tip. same kind of glands imbedded in the muscular fibres, from which several ducts issue. Nerves. There are three nerves on the under surface of each ^J^et3hree half of the tongue, viz., the lingual of the fifth, the hypoglossal, and sources, the glossopharyngeal (fig. 24). The lingual nerve sends upwards filaments through the muscular jj^ual of substance to the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and supplies the conical and fungiform papillae. Accompanying this nerve are the lingual fibres of the chorda tympani (p. 98). The hypoglossal nerve is spent in long slender offsets to the mus- twelfth, cular substance of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve divides under the hyo-glossus into two and ninth, branches. One turns to the dorsum, and ramifies in the mucous membrane behind the foramen caecum, supplying also the circum- vallate papillae. The other passes to the side of the tongue, and ends in branches for the mucous membrane, extending forwards to about the middle of the border. Vessels. The arteries are derived from the lingual of each side : Aer^Jieas^li the veins pass to the internal jugular trunk (p. 96). The lymphatics lymphatics, of the tongue for the most part pass backwards to the upper deep cervical glands, and have connected with them two or three small Ungual glands on the outer surface of the hyo-glossus muscle; but some descend to the submaxillary lymphatic glands. Section XVI. DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. The larynx is the upper dilated part of the airtube, in which the voice is produced. It is constructed of several cartilages united General together by ligamentous bands ; of muscles for the movement of of la^x.'011 the cartilages ; and of vessels and nerves. The whole is lined by mucous membrane. Dissection. The tongue may be removed from the larynx by Dissection, cutting through its root, but this is to be done without injuring the epiglottis.

Their description is given at p. 163. The larynx is placed in the middle of the neck, in front of the pharynx, and in the resting condition opposite the fourth, fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. It is however very moveable, its con- nections permitting especially a considerable degree of elevation, which comes into play in the act of swallowing. Its form is pyramidal, the base being turned upwards and attached to the hyoid bone, while the apex joins the trachea. In length it measures, in the male, about an inch and three-quarters ; in width, at the top nearly as much, and at the lower end one inch ; while the greatest depth from before backwards is about an inch and a half. In the female, the average length is an inch and a half, and the depth one inch. Before the age of puberty the larynx is relatively very small. On each side the larynx is covered by the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, the carotid vessels, and the lateral lobes of the thyroid body. The front projects beneath the skin in the middle line of the neck ; and the posterior surface is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Muscles. The sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles, which, together with the stylo-pharyngeus and inferior constrictor of the pharynx, move the larynx as a whole, are frequently called the extrinsic muscles of the larynx. The intrinsic muscles are six pairs and one single muscle. Of these, one paired muscle is exposed on the side of the larynx ; two pairs and the single muscle are seen at the back; and the rest are concealed by the thyroid cartilage. Directions. On one side of the larynx, say the right, the muscles may be dissected, and on the opposite side the nerves and vessels ; and the superficial muscles are to be first learnt, which do not require the cartilages to be cut. Dissection. The larynx being extended and fastened with pins, the dissector may clear away from the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage the following muscles, viz., omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and inferior constrictor. Along the side, between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, the crico-thyroid muscle (fig. 39) will be recognised. To denude the posterior muscles (fig. 40), it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane covering it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle, and above this, on the back of the arytenoid cartilages, the arytenoid muscle will appear, with the crossing fasciculi of the aryteno-epiglottidean muscles on its surface. The crico-thyroid muscle (fig. 39,') is fan-shaped, and is separated by a triangular interval from the one on the opposite side. It arises from the front and the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage ; and its fibres radiate to be inserted into the lower comu, and the lower border of the thyroid cartilage as far forwards as a quarter of155 EXTERNAL MUSCLES OF LARYNX. an inch from the middle line ; as well as for a short distance into the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the crico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid muscle. Action. It draws the cricoid cartilage upwards and backwards, so Use. as to increase the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, and thus tightens the vocal cords.

Dissection Of internal muscles. Remove half of thyroid cartilage. Position of muscles. Lateral crico-aryte- noid mus- cle. Use. The arytenoid muscle is single, and extends across the middle line, closing the interval between the arytenoid cartilages behind. Its transverse fibres are attached on each side to the outer part of the posterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. On its hinder surface lie the aryteno-epiglottidean muscles; and the laryngeal mucous membrane covers it in front in the space between the cartilages. Action. It draws together the arytenoid cartilages, rendering narrower the opening of the glottis. The aryteno-epiglottidean muscles are two small bundles which cross obliquely from one side to the other on the back of the arytenoid muscle. Each arises from the outer and lower part of the posterior surface of one arytenoid cartilage, and passes to the upper part of the outer border of the cartilage of the opposite side, where a few of the fibres are inserted, but the greater number turn round this border and end in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of the mucous membrane, some reaching the margin of the epiglottis. A slip is also prolonged into the thyro-arytenoid muscle. The ending of the muscle will be seen later when the ala of the thyroid carti- lage has been removed. Action. These muscles bring together the tips of the arytenoid cartilages, and depress the epiglottis, thus assisting to close the upper aperture of the larynx in swallowing. Dissection. The remaining muscles and the vocal apparatus would be learnt better on a fresh larynx, if this can be obtained. To bring into view the deep muscles (fig. 41), it will be necessary to remove the greater part of the right ala of the thyroid cartilage, by cutting through it a quarter of an inch from the middle line, after its lower eomu has been detached from the cricoid, and the crico- thyroid muscle taken away. By dividing next the thyro- hyoid membrane attached to the upper margin, the loose piece will come away on separating the subjacent areolar tissue from it. By the removal of some areolar tissue, the dissector will define inferioiiy the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle ; above it, the thyro- arytenoid muscle ; and still higher, the pale fibres of the aryteno- epiglottidean and thyro-epiglottidean muscles in the fold of mucous membrane between the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilage. On cleaning the fibres of the thyro-arytenoid near the front of the larynx, the top of the sacculus laryngis with its small glands will appear above the fleshy fibres. The lateral crico-arytenoid muscle (fig. 41,3) arises from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage at the side, and is directed back- wards to be inserted into the fore part of the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. It is concealed by the cricothyroid muscle and the thyroid cartilage ; and its upper border is contiguous to the succeeding muscle. Action. It rotates inwards the arytenoid cartilage, opposing the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle, and approaching the one vocal cord to the other, so as to narrow the glottis.INTEENAL MUSCLES OF LAEYNX. 157 outer and inner parts. | Some fibres from aryte- noid carti- lage to vocal cord. Relations. The thyroarytenoid muscle (fig. 41) extends from the thyroid ^n^°"ary" to the arytenoid cartilage ; it is thick below, but thin and expanded muscle above. The muscle arises from the thyroid cartilage near the middle line, for about the lower half of its depth, and from the crico-thyroid membrane. The fibres are directed backwards with consists of different inclinations :—The external (4) ascend somewhat and are inserted into the outer border of the arytenoid car- tilage. The internal fibres (s) are horizontal, and form a thick bundle which is inserted into the margins of the vocal process and the lower part of the outer surface of that car- tilage. A few of the deepest fibres of the muscle pass from the outer surface of the vocal process of the arytenoid carti- lage to be inserted into the true vocal cord. The outer surface of the muscleis coveredbythe thyroid cartilage ; and the inner sur- face rests on the vocal cords, and on the ventricle and pouch of the larynx. Action. Thethyro-arytenoid draws forwards the arytenoid cartilage, and causes the cricoid to move forwards and downwards, thus opposing the crico-thyroid muscle, and shortening the vocal cords. It also moves inwards the fore part of the arytenoid cartilage with the true vocal cord, so as to place the latter in the position necessary for vocalization. The short fibres passing from the arytenoid cartilage to the vocal cord will tighten the fore part, and relax the Joinder part of the ■ cord. The thyro-epiglottidean muscle is a thin layer which varies Thyro- much in its development in different bodies. Its fibres arise from j^^)iiiji3C]e the thyroid cartilage in conjunction with the outer part of the thyro- arytenoid, and are directed upwards, covering the outer surface of the saccule of the larynx, to be inserted into the margin of the Use. * Internal muscles of the larynx. 1.

The whole of the muscular fibres passing from the arytenoid and thyroid cartilages to the epiglottis are sometimes described together as the depressor of the epiglottis. Use. Action, This muscle draws downwards the epiglottis and aryteno- epiglottidean fold, and assists in closing the upper aperture of the larynx. Interior of CAVITY OF THE LARYNX AND PARTS INSIDE. On looking into the Thecavitvis cavity °^ tne l^y11* horn above, the tube will be seen to become constricted narrower from above downwards, owing to the projection inwards of m middle. prominent folds on each side termed the vocal cords. The lower or true vocal cords are placed on a level with the bases of the ary- tenoid cartilages, and the slit-like interval between them is called the glottis. Below this the cavity enlarges again to the lower aperture of the larynx, where it is continued into the trachea. Upper open- Upper aperture of the larynx (fig. 30, n). This is the orifice by which the larynx communicates with the pharynx. It is tri- form and angular in shape, with the base, which is formed by the epiglottis, boundaries, turned forwards and upwards. The sides, which are sloped from before downwards and backwards, are formed by the aryteno-epi- glottidean folds of the mucous membrane ; and at the apex is the arytenoid muscle, with the upper ends of the arytenoid cartilages, covered by the mucous membrane. This aperture is closed by the epiglottis during deglutition. Lower open- The lower aperture of the larynx, bounded by the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, is nearly circular in form, and of the same size as the interior of the cartilage. Dissection. Dissection. To see the parts within the larynx, the tube is to be divided by a median incision along the back ; but in cutting through the arytenoid muscle, let the knife be carried a little to the right of the middle line, so as to avoid the nerves entering it. Parts inside On the side wall of the larynx (fig. 42) there will now be seen the projecting bands of the vocal cords separated by a depression called the ventricle of the larynx. If a probe be passed into this hollow, it will enter a small pouch—sacculus laryngis, by an aperture at the upper and fore part, under cover of the superior vocal cord. Glottis, The glottis or rima glottidis is the narrowest part of the laryngeal cavity, and is placed on a level with the bases of the arytenoid position, cartilages. If the cut surfaces of the back of the larynx be placed form, together, it will be seen to have the form of an elongated triangle, boundaries, with the base turned backwards. It is bounded on the sides by the true vocal cords (fig. 42, b) in the anterior two-thirds of its extent, and by the arytenoid cartilages (e) in the posterior third. In front, the right and left vocal cords meet at their attachment to the thyroid cartilage ; and behind, the base is formed by the arytenoid muscle. The portion of the slit between the vocal cords, being Subdivision. alone concerneci in the production of the voice, is distinguished as the vocal glottis, while the part between the arytenoid cartilages is +ermed the respiratory glottis.GLOTTIS AND LARYNGEAL POUCH. 159 The size of the glottis differs in the two sexes; and its form |j^an^. undergoes frequent changes during life, caused by the movements of ormvaiy- the arytenoid cartilages and the vocal cords. In the male, the Lengthi interval measures nearly an inch (eleven lines) from before back- wards ; in the female, from eight to nine lines. Its breadth at the and breadth, base is about one-third of the length. The length of the glottis is increased by the stretching, and shortened by the relaxation of the vocal cords. In quiet breathing the glottis has the triangular form seen after Form death, the space being slightly widened in inspiration, and narrowed j,^^^^. in expiration. In forcible inspiration it becomes widely dilated, ration; the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages being directed out- j^^ation • wards, and the aperture accpoiring the form of a lozenge with the posterior angle truncated. The widest part is then opposite the junction of the vocal cords with the arytenoid cartilages, and its transverse measurement is about one half of the length. During in produc- vocalization the cords and the vocal processes of the arytenoid voice, cartilages are brought together, and the vocal glottis is reduced to a narrow chink, while the hinder part of the space is closed by the meeting of the anterior borders of the arytenoid cartilages. The glottis is rendered longer, and the vocal cords are tightened Muscles pro- by the crico-tbyroid muscles ; the opposite effect is produced by the changes in elasticity of the cords and the contraction of the thyro-arytenoid slottis- muscles. Widening of the glottis is effected by the posterior crico- arytenoid muscles ; and the cords and arytenoid cartilages are approximated by the thyro-arytenoid, lateral crico-arytenoid, and arytenoid muscles. The ventricle of the larynx (fig. 42, a) is best seen on the left Ventricle, side. It is the boat-shaped hollow between the vocal cords, the upper margin being concave, and the lower nearly straight. It is Situation, lined by the mucous membrane, and on the outer surface are the fibres of the thyro-arytenoid muscle. In its roof, towards the front, is the aperture of the laryngeal pouch. The laryngeal pouch or sacculus laryngis (fig. 42, d), has been Pouch of laid bare partly on the right side, by the removal of the ala of the thyroid cartilage (p. 156), but it will be opened in the subsecpient dissection for the vocal cords. It is a small membranous sac, about half an inch long and rather Form and conical in form, which projects upwards between the false vocal positlon- cord and the ala of the thyroid cartilage, reaching as high as the upper border of the latter. Its cavity communicates with the fore part of the ventricle by a somewhat narrow aperture. On the deep Surrounding surface of the mucous lining are numerous small glands, the ducts parts" of which open on the inside. Its outer side is covered by the thyro-epiglottidean muscle. The size and extent of the pouch vary greatly in different subjects. Dissection. The general shape and position of the vocal cords are Dissection evident on the left half of the larynx, but to show more fully ll^al the nature of the lower cord, put the cut surfaces in contact, and C°' detach on the right side the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle from its160 DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. cartilages. Take away in like manner the thyroarytenoid, raising it from before back. By the removal of the last muscle an elastic and crico- membrane, crico-thyroid (fig. 44, 6), comes into view ; and it will be membrane, seen to ^e continued upwards into, and give rise to the prominence of the inferior or true vocal cord. Lastly, dissect off the mucous membrane from the vocal cords on the right side, and in doing this the wall of the ventricle and saccule, which are formed mainly by this membrane, will disappear. The vocal cords (fig. 42) are two bands on each side, which extend from the angle of the thyroid to the aryte- noid cartilage, one forming the upper, the other the lower margin of the ven- tricle of the larynx. Each consists of a fold of the mucous membrane supported by a ligamentous structure —the superior and inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments re- spectively. The superior or false vocal cord (c) is arched with its concavity downwards, and is mucli softer and looser than the lower. Its free border is thick and rounded. The con- tained superior thyro-arytenoid ligament consists mostly of white fibrous tissue, and is fixed in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage near the attach- ment of the epiglottis, behind to the middle portion of the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. It is continuous above with scattered fibrous bundles in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. Inferior The inferior or true vocal cord (b) is attached in front to the angle oord» of the thyroid cartilage about half way down below the notch, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Between these points, its free margin, by the vibration of which the voice is produced, is straight, sharp and smooth. The cord projects upwards and inwards into the cavity of the larynx, and forms the boundary of the vocal portion of the glottis. It is about seven lines long in * Vocal apparatus, on a vertical section of the larynx, a. Ventricle of the larynx. B. True vocal cord. c. False vocal cord. D. Sacculus laryngis. E.

The mucous membrane of the true vocal cord is very thin, and intimately united to the inferior thyro-arytenoid ligament. The latter structure is the upper and liga- edge of the lateral portion of the crico-thyroid membrane, and men consists of fine elastic tissue, which shows a slight thickening close to its attachment to the thyroid cartilage. On the outer surface of the ligament is the deep part of the thyro-arytenoid muscle, some of the fibres of which are inserted into the band ; and a thin sub- mucous layer of elastic tissue is continued outwards from it to line the ventricle of the larynx. The mucous membrane of the larynx is continued from that lining Mucous the pharnyx, and is prolonged downwards into the trachea. At the "n"1,.^"6 superior aperture of the larynx it forms the aryteno-epiglottidean fold on each side, between the margin of the epiglottis and the tip of the arytenoid cartilage : here it is very loose, and the submucous tissue abundant. In the larynx the membrane lines the wall of the cavity closely, sinks into the ventricle, and sends a prolongation upwards into the laryngeal pouch. On the lower thyro-arytenoid ligaments it is very thin and closely adherent, allowing these to be visible through it. In the small part of the larynx above the superior vocal cords, Epithelium the epithelium is of the stratified squamous kind, and free from cilia. But a columnar ciliated epithelium covers the edges of the differs in superior cords and the surface below these, though it becomes flattened without cilia on the lower cords : on the epiglottis the epitheliivm is ciliated in the lower half. Numerous racemose glands are connected with the mucous mem- Glands, braue of the larynx ; and the orifices will be seen on the surface, especially at the posterior aspect of the epiglottis. In the edge of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold there is a little swelling occasioned by a mass of subjacent glands (arytenoid) ; and along the upper vocal cord lies another set. None exist over the true vocal cords, but close to those bands is the collection of the sacculus laryngis, which moistens the ventricle and the lower vocal cord. Dissection of nerves and vessels. .The termination of the laryngeal Dissection nerves may be dissected on the untouched side of the larynx. For ofnen'es; this purpose the other half of the thyroid is to be disarticulated from the cricoid cartilage, care being taken of the recurrent nerve, which lies close behind the joint between the two. The trachea and larynx shoidd be fastened down with pins ; and after the thyroid has been drawn away from the cricoid cartilage, the inferior inferior, laryngeal nerve can be traced over the side of the latter cartilage to the muscles of the larynx and the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Afterwards the superior laryngeal nerve is to be found as it pierces superior the thyro-hyoid membrane, and branches of it are to be followed to lary"eeal the mucous membrane of the larynx and pharynx. Two communica- tions are to be looked for between the laryngeal nerves ; one is beneath the thyroid cartilage, the other in the mucous membrane of the pharynx.DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 162 of vessels.

Arteries: superior laryngeal from superior thyroid; inferior laryngeal from inferior thyroid; from crico- thyroid artery. Veins. Lymphatics. An artery accompanies each nerve, and its offsets are to be dissected at the same time as the nerve. Nerves. The nerves of the larynx are the superior and inferior laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric (p. 110) ; the former is distributed to the mucous membrane, and the latter mostly to the muscles. The inferior laryngeal nerve (recurrent), when about to enter the larynx, furnishes backwards an offset to the mucous membrane of the pharynx ; this joins filaments of the upper laryngeal. The nerve passes finally beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and ends in branches for all the special muscles of the larynx, except the crico-thyroid. Its small muscular branches are mostly superfi- cial, but that to the arytenoid muscle lies beneath the posterior crico-arytenoid. Beneath the thyroid cartilage the inferior is joined by a long offset of the upper laryngeal nerve. The superior laryngeal nerve pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane, and gives offsets to the mucous membrane of the pharynx ; it fur- nishes also a long branch beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage to communicate with the recurrent nerve. The trunk terminates in many brandies for the supply of the mucous membrane :—Some of these ascend in the afyteno-epiglottidean fold to the epiglottis, and the root of the tongue. The others, which are the largest, descend on the inner side of the sacculus, and supply the lining membrane of the larynx as low as the true vocal cords. One branch of this set pierces the arytenoid muscle, and ends in the mucous membrane. Vessels. The arteries of the larynx are furnished from the supe- rior and inferior thyroid branches (pp. 79 and 70). The laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery enters the larynx with the superior laryngeal nerve, and divides into ascending and descending branches ; some of these enter the muscles, but the rest supply the epiglottis, and the mucous membrane from the root of the tongue to the vocal cord. Like the nerves, the two laryngeal arteries communicate both beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and in the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The laryngeal branch of the inferior thyroid artery ascends on the back of the cricoid cartilage, and ends in the mucous membrane of the pharynx and the posterior muscles of the larynx. Some other twigs from the crico-thyroid branch of the superior, thyroid artery perforate the crico-thyroid membrane, and minify in the mucous lining of the interior of the larynx at the lower part. Laryngeal veins. The vein accompanying the branch of the supe- rior thyroid artery joins the internal jugular or the superior thyroid vein (p. 79) ; and the vein with the artery from the inferior thyroid opens into the plexus of the inferior thyroid veins (p. 119). The lymphatics of the larynx pass to the deep cervical glands.163 HYOID BONE. Section XVII. HYOID BONE, CAETILAGES AND LIGAMENTS OF THE LARYNX, AND STRUCTURE OF THE TRACHEA. Dissection. All the muscles and the mucous membrane are to be Dissection, taken away so as to denude the hyoid bone, the cartilages of the larynx, and the epiglottis ; but the membrane joining the hyoid bone to the thyroid cartilage, and the ligaments uniting one cartilage to another on the left side, shoidd not be destroyed. In the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, a small cartilaginous body (cuneiforni) may be recognised; an oblique whitish projection indicates its position. The hyoid bone (fig. 43) is situate between the larynx and the Hyoid bone, root of the tongue. Kesembling the letter U placed horizontally, Form, and with the legs turned backwards, it offers for examination a central part or body, and two lateral pieces or coniua on each side. The body (g) is elongated transversely, in which direction it Body measures about an inch, and flattened from before back. The anterior surface is convex, and marked in the centre by a tubercle, on each side of which is an impression for muscular attachment. The posterior surface is concave and smooth. To the upper border the hyo-glossal membrane, fixing the tongue, is attached. The cornua are two in number on each side—large and small. Cornua, The large cornu (h) continues the bone backwards, and is joined to 18,1,56 the body by an intervening piece of cartilage, or in old persons by continuous bony union. The surfaces of this cornu look rather upwards and down wards ; and the size decreases from before back- wards. It ends posteriorly in a tubercle. The small cornu (j) is and small, directed upwards from the point of union of the great cornu with the body, and is joined by the stylo-hyoid ligament: it is seldom wholly ossified. It is united to the body of the bone by a synovial joint, with a surrounding capside. Cartilages of the Larynx (fig. 43). There are four large in larynx cartilages in the larynx, by which the vocal cords are supported, fom-'iarge viz., the thyroid, the cricoid, and the two arytenoid. In ad- dition there are some yellow fibro-cartilaginous structures, viz., and some the epiglottis, a capitulum to each arytenoid cartilage, and a small 1™"" carti" ovalish piece (crmeiform) in each aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane. The thyroid cartilage (b) is the largest of all: it forms the Thyroid front of the larynx, and protects the vocal apparatus as with a shield. cai'tilaae The upper part of the cartilage is considerably wider than the lower, and in consecpience of this form the larynx is somewhat funnel-shaped. The fore part is prominent in the. middle line in is convex in front, forming the subcutaneous swelling named pomum Adairri, and front' concave behind, where it gives attachment to the epiglottis, and to concave behind.

Posteriorly each ala has a I hick border, which is continued upwards and downwards in a rounded process or cornu (e and p). Both cornua are bent slightly inwards : of the two, the upper (e) is the longer; but the Fig- lower one (f) is the thicker, and articulates with the cricoid cartilage. The inner surface of the ala is smooth ; the outer is marked by an oblique line for the attachment of muscles, which extends from a tubercle near the root of the upper comu, to a projection at the middle of the lower border. The CRICOID CARTILAGE (d) is stronger though smaller than the thyroid, aud surrounds the lower part of the cavity of the larynx ; it is partly con- cealed by the thyroid cartilage, below which it is placed. It is very unequal in depth before and behind,—the posterior part being nearly four times as deep as the anterior, something like a signet ring. Its contained space is about as large as the fore finger. At the back of the cartilage there is a flat and rather square portion, which is marked on its posterior surface by a median ridge, between two oval depressions occupied by the posterior crico-arytenoid muscles. On each side, immediately in front of the square jiart, is a slightly raised articular facet, which receives the lower cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The inner surface is smooth, and is covered by mucous membrane. The lower border is horizontal, somewhat undulating, and is united to the trachea by fibrous membrane. The upper border of the broad part of the cartilage is slightly excavated in the middle, and is limited on each, side by a convex articular facet for the ary- tenoid cartilage, which slopes downwards and outwards. In front of that spot, the border descends rapidly as it passes forwards to the middle line. * Hyoid bone and laryngeal cartilages : o. Body of hyoid bone. h. Large cornu. J. Small cornu. a.

The base has the form of an elongated triangle, with one of the Base, angles (the postero-internal) rounded off. Its anterior extremity is thin and tapering, and gives attachment to the inferior thyro- arytenoid ligament, whence it is named the vocal process. The external angle is thick, and projects backwards and outwards, form- ing the muscular process, into which the crico-arytenoid muscles are inserted. On the under aspect of the muscular process is an oval, concave articular facet, sloped downwards and outwards, for the cricoid cartilage. The apex of the cartilage is directed backwards, Apex, and is surmounted by the capitulum of Santorini. The inner surface is narrow, especially above, and flat; it is Surfaces: covered by the mucous membrane. The anterior or outer surface is internal, the largest and irregular, being convex above and concave below, anterior or " 6Xu6IU&l It is marked near the upper end by a tubercle, and lower down, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds, by an oblique ridge. This surface gives attachment to the superior thyro-arytenoid liga- ment and the thyro-arytenoid muscle. At its posterior aspect the and cartilage is concave and smooth, being covered by tlie arytenoid muscle. l)0steno1- Cartilages of Santorini, cornicula or capitula laryngis. At- Fibro-carti- tached to the apex of each arytenoid cartilage is the small, conical ^ts0"uli fibro-cartilage of Santorini, which is inclined backwards and inwards. The aryteno-epiglottidean fold is connected with it. Cuneiform cartilages. Two other small fibro-cartilaginous Fibro-carti- bodies, one on each side, which are contained in the aryteno- wrteber<\ epiglottidean folds, have received this name. Each is somewhat elongated in form, like a grain of rice ; it is situate obliquely in front of the capitulum of the arytenoid cartilage, and its place in the fold of the mucous membrane is marked by a slight whitish projection. These cartdages are often absent. The epiglottis (fig. 43, a) is single, and is the largest of the Epiglottis pieces of yellow fibro-cartilage. In form it resembles an obovate Form and leaf, with the stalk below and' the blade above. Its position is P°sitio"- behind the tongue, and in front of the orifice of the larynx. During respiration it is placed vertically ; but during deglutition it takes a horizontal direction so as to close the opening of the larynx. The anterior surface is covered in its upper part by mucous Surfaces: membrane, which forms the three glosso-epiglottidean folds (p. 152) auterior' between it and the tongue; its lower part is attached to the hyo.id bone by fatty tissue containing glands, and by the hyo-epiglottidean ligament. The posterior surface is entirely covered by closely and adherent mucous membrane, and is for the most part concave ; but po3terior- at the lower end there is an elevation known as the tubercle or ousMon of the epiglottis. To the sides the aryteno-epiglottidean Sides, folds of mucous membrane are united. After the mucous membrane Glands in it. has been removed from the cartilage, its substance will be seen to be excavated by numerous pits, which lodge mucous glands.DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 166 Ossification of laryngeal cartilages.

Between cricoid and thyroid cartilages. Crico- thyroid membrane : median part, and lateral parts. Relations. In the adult the hyaline cartilages of the larynx are commonly to a greater or less extent (in old persons sometimes completely) converted into hone. The ossification begins in the thyroid and cricoid cartilages at about twenty years of age, the deposition of osseous matter in the former taking place first in the neighbourhood of the inferior cornu, and thence extending along the inferior and posterior borders; while in the cricoid two or three bony spots appear near the arytenoid articular surface on each side, and spread through the upper part of the cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages ossify later, from below upwards. The tendency to ossification is more marked in the male than in the female. Ligaments of the Larynx. The larynx is connected by extrinsic ligaments with the hyoid bone above and the trachea below. Other ligaments unite together the cartilages, sometimes with joints. Union of the larynx with the hyoid bone and the trachea. A loose elastic membrane (thyro-hyoid) extends from the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone ; and a second membrane connects the cricoid cartilage with the trachea. The thyro-hyoid membrane (fig. 42, l) is attached on the one hand to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage ; and on the other, to the upper border of the hyoid bone. Its central part, extending from the body of the hyoid bone to the margins of the notch in the thyroid cartilage, is of some thickness, but its lateral parts are thin and ill-defined. It ends behind in a rounded elastic cord on each side (lateral thyro-hyoid ligament), uniting the extremity of the great comu of the hyoid bone to the superior cornu of the thyroid eartdage : this band frecpiently contains a small cartilaginous or osseous nodule (cartilago triticea). The superior laryngeal nerve and vessels perforate the lateral part of the membrane ; and a synovial bursa is placed between its central part and the posterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone. The membrane joining the lower border of the cricoid cartilage to the first ring of the trachea—crico-tracheal ligament, resembles the fibrous layer joining the rings of the trachea to each other. Union of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. These cartilages are united by a membrane in front, and a synovial joint on each side. The crico-thyroid membrane (fig. 44, fi) occupies the space between the thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid cartilages ; and its right half is now visible. It is of a yellow colour and is formed niamly of elastic tissue. By its lower border the membrane is fixed to the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage, reaching back to the articulation with the arytenoid. Its central part is thick and strong, and is attached above to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. The lateral part is thinner, and is continued upwards beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, to end in a thickened border, which is attached behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage, constituting the inferior thyro-arytenoid ligament in the true vocal cord (p. 161). The central part of the membrane is partly exposed between the crico-thyroid muscles, and small apertures exist in it for the passage of vessels into the larynx. The lateral part is separated from theARTICULATIONS OF THE LARYNX. 167 Fig. 44.* movements.

The crico-thyroid articulation is formed between the inferior cornu Crico- of the thyroid and the lateral articular facet of the cricoid cartilage. jomt°ld A capsular ligament, which is thickest behind, and lined by syno- vial membrane, surrounds the articulation. This joint allows of a slight degree of slidin" movement backwards and for- wards, and of a rotatory movement around a transverse axis, by which the front of the cricoid cartilage is raised or de- pressed. (See the action of the crico- thyroid and thyro-arytenoid muscles.) Crico-arytenoid articulation. Between the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages there is a synovial joint surrounded by a loose cap- side. To the inner side of the joint there is a well marked crico-arytenoid ligament, Avhich passes from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage near the middle line to the adjacent part of the base of the ary- tenoid, and prevents the latter cartilage being drawn forwards over the cricoid. The arytenoid cartilage glides upwards and inwards, or downwards and out- wards, to a slight extent on the oblicpie articular facet of the cricoid; but its principal movement is one of rotation, by which the vocal process is carried inwards and somewhat downwards, approximating the vocal cords and narrowing the glottis, or outwards and upwards, enlarging the glottis. Between the apex of the arytenoid cartilage and the capitulum Arytenoid there is sometimes a synovial joint, but the two cartdages are most capitulum. frequently united by connective or fibro-cartdaginous tissue. The thyro-arytenoid ligaments have been examined with the vocal cords (p. 160). Ligaments of the epiglottis.

The windpipe consists of a series of pieces of cartilage (fig. 40), which are deficient behind, and con- nected together by fibrous tissue. The interval between the carti- lages at the back of the tube is closed by fibrous membrane and muscular fibres; and the interior is lined by mucous membrane with subjacent elastic tissue. Cartilages. The pieces of cartilage vary in number from sixteen to twenty. Each forms about three-fourths of a ring, extending round the front and sides of the airtube. Their arrangement is not quite regular throughout, for some of them are often bifurcated at one end, or sometimes two adjacent pieces are partly fused together. The highest is commonly broader than the others, and may be joined to the cricoid cartilage. The lowest piece is triradiate, or V-shaped, a median process being sent downwards and backwards in the angle between the two bronchi. The fibrous membrane ensheaths the cartilages and, being con- tinued across the intervening spaces, binds them together. It also extends across the posterior part of the trachea. Dissection. On removing for about two inches the fibrous mem- brane and the mucous glands from the interval between the carti- lages at the back of the trachea, the muscular fibres will appear. After the muscular fibres have been examined the membranous part of the tube may be divided, to see the elastic tissue and the mucous membrane. Muscular fibres. Between the ends of the cartilages is a continuous layer of transverse bundles of imstriated muscle, which is attached to the truncated ends and the adjacent part of the inner surface of the cartilaginous hoops. By the one surface the fleshy fibres are in contact with the fibrous membrane and glands, and by the other with the elastic tissue. Some longitudinal fibres are superficial to the transverse; they are arranged in scattered bundles, and are attached to the fibrous tissue. The elastic tissue forms a complete lining to the trachea beneath the mucous membrane ; and at the posterior part, where the carti- lages are wanting, it is gathered into strong longitudinal bundles. This layer is closely connected with the mucous membrane co- vering it. The mucous membrane of the trachea lines the tube, and resembles that of the larynx in being furnished with a columnar ciliated epi- thelium. Connected with this membrane are numerous branched mucous glands of variable size. The largest are found at the back of the trachea, in the membranous part of the wall, where some are placed outside the fibrous layer, and others between that membrane and the muscular fibres. Smaller glands lie beneath the mucous mem- brane.

Dissection. The prevertebral muscles will be prepared by removing Dissection, the fascia and areolar tissue. They are three in number on each side (fig. 45), and are easily distinguished. Nearest the middle line, and the longest, is the longus colli ; the muscle external to it, which reaches to the head, is the rectus capitis anticus major; and the small muscle close to the skull, which is external to the last and partly concealed by it, is the rectus capitis anticus minor. The smaller rectus muscle is often injured in cutting through the basilar process of the occipital bone. The longus colli muscle (fig. 45, a) is situate on the bodies of the cervical and upper dorsal vertebra, and is pointed above and below. It consists of three parts—one internal and two external, ^j"8?8^ which differ in the direction of their fibres, but are closely united parts: together. The internal part is vertical, and arises by fleshy and internal or tendinous processes from the bodies of the upper two dorsal and straisht> lower two cervical vertebra. It is inserted by similar slips into the bodies of the second, third and fourth cervical vertebrae. The upper superior external part is inclined obliquely inwards. It arises from the oWitiue> anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the side of the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. It is generally joined by a slip from the upper end of the vertical part of the muscle. The lower external part, also oblique, but in the opposite direc- and inferior tion to the last, arises in common with the inner part from the obli(lue- upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebras. In contact with the anterior surface of the longus colli are the Parts in pharynx and oesophagus. The inner border is at some distance from the muscle of the opposite side below, but above only the pointed anterior common ligament of the vertebrae separates the two.

The vessel is accompanied by a vein, and by a plexus of nerves of the same name. In the neck the artery furnishes small twigs to the surrounding muscles, the spinal canal, and the spinal cord. The vertebral vein begins on the neural arch of the alias by tin- union of a considerable offset from the intraspinal venous plexuses with other branches proceeding from a network between the muscles in the suboccipital region. It is also joined by the emissary vein leaving the skull through the posterior condylar foramen when that aperture is present. Accompanying its artery in the neck, the vein descends through the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebra?, and terminates by emptying itself into the innominate trunk. In this course it is joined by branches from the internal and external spinal veins ; its other tributaries are noticed at p. 70. The vertebral plexus of nerves is derived from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic (p. ] 15). It surrounds the artery, and communicates with the spinal nerves which it crosses.

Special ligaments unite the first two cervical vertebra to each Special other and to the occipital bone : some of these are external to, and ll°ai!ie"t!5 others within the spinal canal. The ligaments outside the spinal canal are fibrous membranes, between which connect the axis to the atlas, aud the latter to the occipital vertebra bone in front aud behind. Capsular ligaments also surround the ^l'bone'1"" articulations formed by these bones on each side, but they will be , examined more conveniently after the spinal canal has been opened. The anterior atlaato-axial ligament (fig. 46, 3) consists of a mem- ^mlnt branous layer attached to the anterior arch of the atlas and the body between of the axis, and a superficial thickened band in the centre, prolonged atlas and from the upper end of the anterior common ligament, and connect- axis' ing the ridge on the front of the axis to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. The anterior occipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 46) resembles the and between foregoing, and passes from the basilar process of the occipital bone, occipital immediately in front of the foramen magnum, to the anterior arch of the atlas. Its central part is also thickened, and is fixed to the tubercle on the front of the atlas. The posterior occipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 47, l) is a thin broad Posterior membrane, the deep surface of which is intimately united to the ten dura mater. It is attached above to the hinder maroin of the occipital foramen magnum of the occipital bone, and below to the posterior atbsmi arch of the atlas.

Next, the ring of the occipital bone bounding posteriorly the foramen magnum is to be taken away. Lastly, the student should detach the tube of dura mater from the interior of the spinal canal; and, by following upwards the posterior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebrae, its continuation, the long occipito-axial Hgament, will be exposed. The long ox posterior occipito-axial ligament (l) is a strong flat band Long which continues upwards the i?osterior common ligament of the axial vertebra?. Its ivpper end is broad, and is attached to the upper ligament, surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, reaching outwards Fig. 49.* on each side as far as the insertion of the check ligaments. De- scending thence through the foramen magnum, and over the odon- toid process, it becomes somewhat narrower, and is inserted mainly into the back of the body of the axis, but many of the superficial fibres are prolonged into the posterior common ligament. Occasion- ally a bursa is found between it and the transverse ligament. Dissection (fig. 49). After the removal of the long occipito-axial Dissection ligament, by cutting through it transversely above, and reflecting yj™as~ it downwards, the student should define a strong band, the trans° V61Se verse ligament, which crosses the neck of the odontoid process, and sends upwards and downwards a slip to the occipital bone, and the axis. The upper offset from the transverse ligament may be cut through afterwards for the purpose of seeing the odontoid ligaments, and odontoid which radiate from the process, the central one being a slender band ligaments, in the middle line, and the lateral, much stronger, passing nearly horizontally outwards. * Internal ligaments between the occipital bone, atlas, and axis, second view (tfourgery.) 1.

The ligament is rounded at each end, but flattened and wider in the middle ; and at this spot it has a band of longitudinal fibres connected with its upper and lower margins (fig. 49, 2) so as to produce a cruciform figure : the upper band is inserted into the basilar process, and the lower into the body of the axis. Towards the spinal canal it is concealed by the long occipito-axial ligament. Fig. 50.* Socket for odontoid process. Check ligaments. Suspensory ligament. Articular surfaces of odontoid process, and two synovial sacs. Occipito- atlantal articula- tions are condyloid joints. This ligament forms, with the anterior arch of the atlas, a ring (fig. 50, ^ which surrounds the neck of the odontoid process of the axis, and prevents separation of the bones. The lateral odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 49, ') are two strong bundles of fibres, attached by one end to a flat impression on each side of the head of the odontoid process, and by the other to a rough mark on the inner surface of the condyle of the occipital bone. These ligaments are covered by the long occipito-axial band: their upper fibres are short and nearly horizontal; the lower are longer and oblique. The central odontoid ligament is a small median cord, which passes from the tip of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. When the transverse and odontoid ligaments have been cut through, the odontoid process will be seen to have two cartilage- covered surfaces, which correspond to as many synovial sacs. One surface is on the front of the process, and articulates with the anterior arch of the atlas ; the other is the floor of the groove behind the neck of the process, and is in contact with the transverse ligament. The posterior synovial sac is larger than the anterior. Occipito-atlantal articulations.

The lateral articulations are formed on each side by the gliding inferior articular process of the atlas and the upper articular j°mts- surface of the axis. These are united by a loose capsule (fig. 46,1), which is thickened so as to give rise to an accessory ligament at the inner and posterior aspect of the joint. The articular surface of the Articular axis is somewhat convex, and is sloped downwards and outwards ; latter. while that of the atlas presents a slight transverse ridge in the middle, so that the opposed surfaces are more extensively in contact when the atlas is turned to one side, than when it is placed symmetrically over the axis.

Its fibres run obliquely from the clavicle downwards and inwards to the sternum. The stronger parts in front and behind are described as the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaments. The interclavicular ligament (fig. 51,3) extends above the sternum, between the ends of the clavicles. The fibres dip into the hollow between the collar-bones, and are connected with the upper edge of the sternum. and costo- clavicular ligament. Fibro- cartilage. Attach- ments. The costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament (fig. 51,2) is a short strong band of oblique fibres, passing from the upper surface of the cartilage of the first rib to a rough mark on the under surface of the clavicle near the sternal end. In front of the ligament is the origin of the subclavius muscle. Sometimes the ligament is hollow, and contains a synovial bursa. The interarticular fibro-cartilage (fig. 51,') will come into view by cutting the ligaments before described, and raising the clavicle. It is ovalish in form and flattened, and is thicker at the ch'cumference than in the centre. Its upper margin is firmly united to the inner end of the clavicle ; and below, it is similarly fixed to the cartilage of the first rib. At its circumference it unites with the capsule of * Ligaments of the inner end of the clavicle, and of the cartilage of the second rib. 1. Capsule. 2. Costo-clavicular ligament. 3.

The clavicle can be moved upwards and downwards, Motion in and forwards and backwards ; but the extent of movement in each directions, direction is very limited, in consequence of the shortness of the liga- ments surrounding the articulation: the forward and upward movements are freer than the opposite. In the upward and down- ward movements, the clavicle glides on the interarticular fibro- cartilage ; and when the shovdder is depressed, the inner end of the bone is raised, while elevation of the shoulder is accompanied by a sinking of the inner end of the clavicle. In the forward and backward movements, the fibro-cartilage glides in the same direction over the sternal articular surface. Dislocation may take place in any direction, except downwards ; but it is of rare occurrence owing to the strength of the ligaments. x 2CHAPTER II. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Section I. Position of the brain. Outline of cranial mass. Medulla oblongata. Pons Varolii and its connections. Cerebellum. Cerebrum, and its great divisions. Weight of brain. Three membranes. MEMBRANES AND VESSELS. During the examination of the membranes, vessels, and nerves, the brain is to be placed upside down, resting in the coil of a cloth which supports it evenly. Subdivisions of the encephalon. Before the description of the membranes and vessels is given, the chief subdivisions of the en- cephalon may be shortly noticed. The cranial or encephalic mass of the nervous system (fig. 59) consists of cerebrum, or great brain, cerebellum or small brain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each of these parts has the folloAving situation and subdivisions :— The medulla oblongata, or the upper end of the spinal cord (fig. 59, a), lies in the groove between the halves of the small brain, ami is divided into two symmetrical parts by a median fissure. To it several of the cranial nerves are united. The pons Varolii (fig. 59, d) is situate above the medulla oblongata, and is marked along the middle by a groove, which indicates a separation into halves. Above it are two large processes (crura cerebri, /) connecting it to the great brain ; and on each side it is united to the small brain by a similar white mass (crus cerebelli). The cerebellum (fig. 59, b), or the small brain, is separated into two hemispheres by a median groove; and its surface is marked by concentric lamina?. The cerebrum (fig. 59, r and p), or the large brain, is divided into hemispheres by a longitudinal fissure in the middle line ; and each half is farther subdivided into two by a transverse cleft—the fissure of Sylvius. The surface of the hemispheres is convoluted. In the centre of the cerebrum, between the hemispheres, and in front of the pons, are several small bodies which will be afterwards enumerated. The average weight of the brain in the European male is about 49 oz. ; in the female about 44 oz. Membranes op the Brain. The coverings of the brain (meninges) are three in number, viz., dura mater, pia mater, and arachnoid membrane. The dura mater is a firm fibrous investment, which181 ARACHNOID AND PIA MATER. separates and supports different parts of the brain, and serves as an internal periosteum to the bones. The pia mater is the most internal layer, and contains the ramifications of the vessels of the brain. The arachnoid, which is interposed between the other two, is the membrane that is seen when the brain is removed from its cavity. Besides enveloping the brain, these membranes are prolonged on the cord into the spinal canal. Only the cranial part of the last two will be now noticed. For the description of the cranial portion Dora mater, of the divra mater, see p. 9. The aeachnoid is a very thin fibrous membrane, which envelops Arachnoid the brain loosely, and is separated from the dura mater by the interval named the subdural space, from the pia mater, by the sub- arachnoid space. Its outer surface is free and smooth, and in the natural state is in close apposition to the dura mater. The inner surface is attached to the pia mater by numerous fine cords and bands, which cross the subarachnoid space. The membrane covers Relations the convolutions and laminae of the large and small brain, bridging to sul01- over the sulci between them, and at the base of the brain it stretches across from side to side between the cerebral hemispheres, so as to leave a considerable space beneath it. Above, it is prolonged into the median fissure between the cerebral hemispheres as far as the falx cerebri, but does not reach to the bottom of the cleft. On the nerves leaving the cavity of the cranium, the arach- Sheaths on noid forms tabular sheaths which enter the apertures in the dura neive" mater, and then terminate in a free edge; but around the vessels and vessels, passing to or from the brain, the membrane joins the dura mater. The subarachnoid space is filled by a watery fluid named cerebro- Suharach- spinal. Its size varies greatly at different parts. Over the con- varies m*26 volutions and prominences of the brain the arachnoid approaches extent, the pia mater closely, and the interval is very small; but opposite the sulci and depressions of the surface the space is expanded. The largest cavity is between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, Three large where the arachnoid is reflected from the one to the other much cavities, earlier than the pia mater. By an aperture in the latter membrane at this spot the subarachnoid space communicates with the cavity of the fourth ventricle. Another considerable interval exists between the cerebral hemispheres in front of the pons ; and a third extends the whole length of the corpus callosum, in the great longitudinal fissure. The pia mater closely invests the brain, following all inequali- Pia mater ties of the surface, and dipping into the srdci of the cerebrum and cerebellum. It also sends a large process, named velum interpositum, forms velum into the interior of the cerebrum, and from this vascular processes inte£ i 7-77 . . positum known as choroid plexuses project mto some of the ventricles of the and choroid brain. Two similar fringes, the choroid plexuses of the fourth PlexuBes' ventricle, project into that cavity between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The pia mater consists of a network of vessels, formed by the Structure, ramifications of the arteries and reins entering into, or issuing182 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. from the nervous substance, the intervals between the vessels being closed by connective tissue so as to form a continuous membrane. From its deep aspect minute and very numerous vessels pass into the brain perpendicularly to the siu-face. Vessels and Vessels and nerves. The arachnoid has no vessels, but various nerves of * i t i membranes, anatomists have described minute branches of some of the cranial nerves in the membrane. The sources of the vessels of the pia mater are given below, and its nerves, which are probably destined for the vessels, come from several cranial nerves and the sympathetic. Dissection of Dissection. To follow out the arteries, let the brain remain upside arteries down, and let the arachnoid membrane be removed from them. Having displayed the trunks of the vertebral arteries on the medulla oblongata, aud those of the carotid near the median fissure of the of large large brain, the student should lay bare on one side the branches to the large brain. Define first the two arteries (anterior cerebral) lying in the median fissure and joining by a short branch ; next, an artery that passes outwards in the fissure of Sylvius (middle cere- bral), and pursue it to the outer surface of the hemisphere. Look then for a much smaller vessel (choroid), which sinks into the brain on the outer side of the crus cerebri. By gently raising the cere- bellum on the same side, the last artery of the cerebrum (posterior cerebral) may be traced back to the inner part of the hemisphere, and of small Two principal arteries pass to the small brain. One on the upper surface (superior cerebellar) may be brought into view Avith the slender fourth nerve by its side on raising the cerebellum. The other artery (inferior cerebellar) turns backwards from the vertebral to the median groove, and may be easily followed. Arteries of Arteries of the Brain (fig. 52). The brain is supplied with the brain. blood by the vertebral and internal carotid arteries. Vertebral The vertebral artery (12) is a branch of the subclavian trunk (p. 69), and enters the skull through the foramen magnum; directed ends in upwards and forwards round the medulla oblongata, it blends with basilar, ^g feuow jn a common trunk (basilar) at the lower border of the winds round pons.

The anterior spinal branch (13) is small like the preceding, and springs from the trunk opposite the front of the medulla. It joins the corresponding twig of the opposite side, and the resulting vessel is continued along the middle of the cord on the anterior aspect.183 YERTEBEAL AND BASILAR ARTERIES. d. The inferior cerebellar artery (posterior, ,0) arises from the end JJ^* nndB of the vertehral (sometimes from the basilar), and winds backwards cerebellum, round the medulla oblongata, between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, to the median groove of the cerebellum. Directed onwards in the sulcus between the hemisphere and the inferior vermiform process, the artery reaches the hinder margin of the small brain, and there anastomoses with the superior cere- bellar artery. An offset of this branch ramifies over the under part of the offsets, cerebellar hemisphere, and ends externally by anastomosing with the Fig. 52.* artery of the upper surface. As the vessel passes by the side of the fourth ventricle, it gives a small choroid branch to the plexus of that cavity.

One of them (9) gives an offset (auditory) to the internal ear along the auditory nerve. b. Kesembling the brandies of this set is the anterior cerebellar artery: tins arises from the basilar'trunk, and extends to the fore part of the under surface of the cerebellar hemisphere, on which it is distributed. c The .superior cerebellar artery (8) is derived from the basilar so near the termination as to be often described as one of the final I ranches of that vessel. Its destination is to the upper surface of the small brain, to which it is directed backwards, winding round the cms cerebri below the third, but parallel to the fourth nerve. The ramifications of the artery spread over the upper surface of the cerebellum, and anastomose, with the vessel of the opposite side, and with the inferior cerebellar artery. Some twigs of this vessel enter the fold of the pia mater (velum interpositum) which projects into the cerebrum. d. The posterior cerebral artery C) takes on each side a backward course, similar to that of the preceding artery, but separated from it by the third nerve. Gaining the under surface of the cerebral hemisphere, it divides into branches (superficial or cortical) which supply the whole of the occipital lobe, and the lower and inner parts of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. Its other offsets are the following :— Numerous small long branches (deep or central) leave the trunk close to its origin, and enter the posterior perforated space between the crura cerebri, to supply the optic thalami in the interior of the brain. A small choroid artery (posterior) passes between the crus and the hemisphere of the cerebrum to the velum interpositiun and choroid plexus. Near its origin it is farther joined by the posterior communicating artery of the carotid. From the foregoing examination of the offsets of the vertebral arteries and the basilar trunk, it appears that about half the cn- cephalon—viz., the medulla oblongata, the pons, the cerebellum, and the posterior third of the cerebrum—receives its blood through these branches of the subclavian arteries. The internal carotid artery (') terminates in branches for the remaining part of the cerebrum. The vessel emerges from the cavernous sinus (p. 19) internal to the anterior clinoid process, and divides at the inner end of the fissure, of Sylvius into cerebral and communicating arteries. At the base of the brain the carotid lies between the second and third nerves, but nearer the former. Branches. In the skull the carotid gives off the ophthalmic offset, before it ends in the following branches. a. The posterior communicating artery (G) is generally a small vessel, which is directed backwards parallel to, and on the inner side of the third nerve, to join the posterior cerebral artery (of the basilar) near the pons.185 CIRCLE OF WILLIS. b. The anterior cerebral artery (2) supplies the inner part of the Aatertor cerebral hemisphere. It is directed forwards to the median fissure artery: between the halves of the large brain ; and as it is about to enter, it is united to its fellow by a short thick branch—the anterior its com- comTmmicatmg . Then passing into the fissure, it bends round mumeatinS> the fore part of the corpus callo.suni, and is continued backwards along the upper surface of that body, sending its branches nearly to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere. It is distributed as follows :— Two or three small offsets (central branches) arise near the begin- central, ning of the artery, and penetrate the anterior perforated space at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius to reach the fore part of the corpus striatum in the interior of the hemisphere. The cortical branches supply the fore and upper parts of the imd. cortical internal surface of the hemisphere, extending backwards as far as the parieto-occipital fissure ; and some turn round the margin to the adjacent portions of the frontal lobe on both the upper and lower aspects. c. The middle cerebral arterii C) is the lamest branch of the Middle cerebral carotid, and ramifies over the outer surface of the hemisphere, artery: Entering the fissure of Sylvius, it divides into four or five large cortical branches, which issue from the outer side of that groove, cortical and supply the whole of the parietal lobe, together with the neigh- bouring parts of the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes. A set of small central branches arises from the artery at its origin, and central and passes through the anterior perforated space to the grey matter ianche!'- of the corpus striatum. d. The choroid artery (anterior, 5) is small and arises either from Choroid the trunk of the carotid, or from the middle cerebral artery : it artei'J- passes backwards on the outer side of the posterior communicating artery, and makes its way between the hemisphere and the eras cerebri to the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. Circle of Willis. The arteries at the under part of the brain are Circle of united freely both on their own side and across the middle line in 8' an anastomotic ring—the circle of Willis. On each side this ring is formed by the trunk of the internal carotid giving forwards the vessels that anterior cerebral, and backwards the posterior communicating artery. In front it is constructed by the converging anterior cerebrals, and the anterior communicating artery. And behind is the bifurcation of the basilar trunk into the posterior cerebrals. In the area of the circle lie several bodies corresponding with the floor of the third ventricle. The complete inosculation between the cranial vessels in the Use of the circle of Willis allows at all times a free circulation of blood through inosculation, the brain, even though a large vessel on one side of the neck should be obstructed. Beyond the circle of Willis the arteries of the cerebrum communi- other cate together only by fine anastomoses.' taStESE"8" The veins of the brain enter the sinuses of the dura mater, and Veins of the do not form companion trunks to the arteries. braiM-186 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Two sets to cerebrum; external, which are upper ami lower: and internal Veins of cerebellum. Dissection. Care to be taken in removing pia mater. Two sets of veins belong to the cerebrum, viz., superficial or ex- ternal, and deep or internal. The superficial veins of the upper part of the hemisphere ascend to the superior longitudinal sinus (p. 10) ; and those of the lateral and under parts enter the sinuses in the base of the skull, especially the cavernous and lateral sinuses. These vessels communicate freely together. The deep veins of the cerebrum join the veins of Galen (p. 219), and reach the straight sinus (p. 13). The veins of the cerebellum end differently above and below. On the upper surface they are received by the veins of Galen and the straight sinus ; and on the lower surface they terminate in the occi- pital and lateral sinuses. Dissection. The pia mater and the vessels are now to be stripped from the brain, and the origin of the cranial nerves is to be care- fully defined. Over the cerebrum and pons, the pia mater can be detached with tolerable ease by using two pairs of forceps ; but on the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata the membrane adheres so closely as to require much care in removing it without tearing the brain-substance, or injuring the nerves. In clearing out the groove between the halves of the cerebellum on the under surface, the membrane bounding the opening into the fourth ventricle (p. 235) will be taken away : therefore the position, size, and limits of that opening between the back of the medulla oblon- gata and the cerebellum should be now noted. When the surface has been cleaned, the brain is to be replaced in the spirit, but it is to be turned over occasionally, so that all the parts may be hardened. Section II. ORIGIN OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. Definition. Origin is apparent and real. The cranial nerves take origin from the encephalon, with one ex- ception (spinal accessory), and pass through apertures in the wall of the cranium. The origin of a nerve is not determined by the place at which it appears on the surface, for fibres or roots may be traced deeply into the brain-substance. Each nerve has therefore a superficial or appa- rent, and a deep or real origin. With respect to the superficial attachment there cannot be any doubt; but there is much difference of opinion concerning the deep origin, in consequence of the difficulty of tracing the roots. When Real is from the roots are followed into the encephalon, they enter masses of grey matter. gukstancej containing nerve-cells, which are looked upon as nuclei of origin. ciassifica- The cranial nerves are enumerated as forming nine or twelve tion as nineORIGIN OF CRANIAL NERVES. 187 pairs.. In the former classification (that of Willis) all the trunks or twelve entering one aperture in the skull are regarded as constituting one im"3° nerve ; and thus the facial and auditory are included in the seventh nerve, while the glossopharyngeal, pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory make up the eighth nerve. According to the other arrangement (Soemmering's) each trunk is considered a separate Scemmer- nerve, although it may be associated with others in the foramen of enumeration exit. The classification into twelve pairs is on the whole preferable, £°e"°wed and is the one more generally used. The several nerves may be designated first, second, third, and so ^mSnation forth : this numerical mode of naming applies to all. number, But a second name has been derived for some of the nerves from the parts to which they are supplied ; as instances of this nomen- name of clature the terms pneumo-gastric and hypoglossal may be taken. And ' a different appellation is given to others, in consequence of the function conferred on the part to which they are distributed, as the or function, terms auditory, oculomotor and olfactory express. In this way two names may be employed in referring to a nerve:—one being numerical, the other local or functional, as is exemplified below. The first or olfactory nerves are about twenty fine filaments „g[Vgg0ry which spring from the under surface of the olfactory bulb (p. 203). They are very soft, and break off close to their origin when the brain is removed from the skull. The second or optic (fig. 53,2) is the largest of the cranial Second nerves except the fifth, and appears on the cms cerebri as a flat band, "ptic-1S which is directed inwards to join the one of the opposite side in a commissure. The part behind the commissure is distinguished as the optic tract, and the name optic nerve is confined to the anterior part called portion, which is round and firm. The destination of the nerve is tract' the eyeball. The optic tract is the flattened band winding round the peduncle Optic tract, of the cerebrum. In front, it ends in the commissure ; and behind, it divides into two pieces which will be subsequently seen to take their origin from the optic thalamus, the corpora geniculata, and the origin now superior corpus quadrigeminum. , As the tract passes forwards it is uoncealeil> attached to the crus cerebri by its outer or anterior edge ; and in- ternal to the crus it is placed between the anterior perforated spot relations, on the outer, and the tuber cinereum on the inner side : it is said to be joined here by additional fibres springing from the latter body. The commissure (chiasma) of the nerves measures nearly half an Its convmis- inch across, and lies on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, sure: within the circle of Willis. It is placed in front of the tuber cine- situation, reum ; and passing beneath it (in this position of the brain) is the thin lamina cinerea. In the commissure each tract is resolved into three sets of fibres arrangement with the following arrangement:—The outer fibres, few in number, of fibres- are continued straight to the eyeball of the same side.

The small or aganglionic root is froin pons" the higher, and is separated from the large root by one or two of the transverse bundles of the pons. Both roots pass outwards through an aperture in the dura mater, above the petrous part of the temporal bone, and join in the peculiar manner stated on page 18. Beep origin. The large root divides within the pons into two parts. One Deep origin of these is connected with a mass of grey matter (sensory nucleus of the fifth) ^ 1to,?s ui?c?t near the floor of the fourth ventricle : the other (ascending root of the fifth) medulla arises from the cells of the posterior horn of the grey matter in the lower part oblongata ; of the medulla oblongata (I'echterew), and is directed upwards on the outer surface of the gelatinous substance of Rolando (p. 198) to join the upper part. The small root also has a double origin, one part springing from a special of small in nucleus (motor nucleus of the fifth) in the floor of the fourth ventricle internal JiJi^iji-ihi to the sensory nucleus, and the other (descending root of the fifth) from a collection of nerve-cells on the side of the aqueduct of Sylvius.

The eleventh or spinal ACCESSORY nerve (third trunk of the eighth pair, Willis) consists of two parts—accessory to the vagus, and spinal. The accessory part is of small size, and is formed by the union of slender filaments continuing the line of the glosso-pharyngeal and vagus nerves along the medulla oblongata, as low as the first cervical nerve. After communicating with the spinal part in the jugular foramen, it throws itself into the vagus nerve outside the skull (P- U1)- The spinal part is firm and round, like the third or the sixth nerve, but only a small piece of it can now be seen. It arises by a number of fine filaments from the lateral column of the spinal cord as low as the sixth cervical nerve. As the nerve ascends along the side of the cord it lies between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, with the upper of which it may be connected ; and it enters the skull by the foramen magnum.

On a single brain the student may learn nearly all Directions, the anatomy of the medulla and pons ; but if he can procure one hardened specimen of the medulla oblongata and pons united, and another of a vertical median section through those bodies, he will comprehend much more readily the following description of them. Position. The brain is to remain in the same position as for the Position, examination of the vessels and nerves. The medulla oblongata or bulb is the expanded upper end of Medulla the spinal cord which is contained in the cranium. Its limits are extent,ata' the lower border of the pons in one direction, and the lower margin of the foramen magnum in the other. It is somewhat conical in form, and measures nearly an inch in length, half an inch in form and breadth below, and about an inch at its widest part above. size- Its base joins the pons, the transverse fibres of the latter marking Base, its limit; and its apex is blended with the spinal cord. The Apex, anterior surface (fig. 54) is irregularly convex, and is in contact with Surfaces, the hollowed basilar process of the occipital bone. The opposite surface (fig. 55) is somewhat excavated above, where it forms the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and it rests in the groove between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. On the posterior aspect there are not any cross fibres of the pons, as in front, to mark the extent of the medulla.DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 192 Median iissures, anterior and posterior. Surface con stituents partly con- tinued from cord, partly new. Pyramid. Fig. 54.4 Lateral tract. The medulla oblongata is divided into halves l.y a median fissure in front and behind, in a line with those of the cord. The anterior median fissure is interrupted at the lower end of the medulla by some bundles of fibres which cross obliquely from one side to the other, and constitute the decussation of the pyramids; above, it ends at the lower border of the pons in a dila- tation (foramen CEecum). The in- terior median fissure is continued upwards from the cord through the lower half of the medulla oblongata, and then terminates by the separa- tion of its lateral boundaries to form the sides of the fourth ventricle. On each half of the medulla oblongata are elongated eminences, separated by slight grooves, and continuous with the columns of the spinal cord ; but they receive different names in this part of their extent, and some fresh bodies are added. Tims, the part continuing the anterior column of the cord, by the side of the anterior median fissure, is known as the pyramid (fig. 54,1). The prolongation of the lateral column takes the name of lateral tract (2), the position of which is occupied in the upper half of the medulla by an oval eminence called the olivary body. Continuing the posterior column is the funiculus cuneatus (fig. 55, fc), which is separated from the lateral tract by a smaller eminence to which the name of funiculus of Rolando (R) has been given : in the upper part of the medulla these are succeeded by the restiform body (fig. 54,3; fig. 55, rb) projecting outwards towards the cerebellum. And lastly, between the funiculus cuneatus and the posterior median fissure is the funiculus gracilis (fig. 55, fg) continued from the posterior median column of the cord. The pyramid (anterior) is placed between the anterior median fissure on the inner side and the lateral tract with the olivary body on the outer side. It increases in size from below upwards, whence its name ; but at the upper end it is somewhat constricted and rounded just before it disappears beneath the superficial trans- verse fibres of the pons. This body is only in part prolonged from the anterior column of the cord, its inner portion being formed by the decussating fibres seen in the anterior median fissure. The lateral tract in the lower half of the medidla oblongata is of the same width as the lateral column of the cord; but above, it is * Medulla oblongata and pons from before. 1. Pyramid. 2.

The olivary body is oval in shape and about half an inch long, olive. Its upper end, which is more prominent than the lower, does not quite reach the pons. Internally it is separated from the anterior pyramid by a narrow groove along which the hypoglossal nerve arises ; and externally from the restiform body by a broader one, where the glosso- pharyngeal and vagus nerves issue. The funiculus of Rolando be- gins in a pointed extremity at the lower end of the medulla oblongata, and enlarging upwards forms, on a level with the lower end of the olivary body, a slight prominence known as the tubercle of Rolando. Towards the front this funiculus is separated from the lateral tract by the con- tinuation upwards of the lateral groove of the cord; but pos- teriorly the line of separation from the cuneate funiculus is often indistinct. Tlie funiculus and tubercle of Rolando are better, marked in the child, and the tubercle has then a greyish colour, whence the name tuberculum cinereum is also given to it. The funiculus cuneatus is the prolongation of the posterior Cuneate column of the cord, and forms a swelling—tuberculum cuneatum n"aCniu>i (fig. 55, ct), ojmosite the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle. tubercle. The restiform body is the largest of the prominences of the Kestiform medulla oblongata, and appears to be the continuation of the y' funiculus of Rolando and the funiculus cuneatus. It inclines outwards above, and enters the hemisphere of the cerebellum, of which it constitutes the inferior peduncle. On the back of the medulla, the inner margin of this body forms the lateral boundary of the lower part of the fourth ventricle. The funiculus gracilis (posterior pyramid) lies by the side of the posterior median fissure, and is the smallest of the parts of and clam the medulla oblongata. It ends above in an enlargement termed the clava (fig. 55, cl), which bounds the lower point of the fourth ventricle. * Medulla oblongata and pons from behind, fy. Funiculus gracilis, cl. Clav.i. fc.

For the purpose of seeing the deeper fibres of the medulla oblongata, the pyramid may be cut across on the right side between the decussation and the olivary body (fig. 57) and raised towards the pons. The lateral tract is composed of the remaining fibres of the lateral ra " column of the cord, after the crossed pyramidal tract has been given off. Most of these pass deeply behind the olivary body, and through the reticular formation to the pons ; but one .small band, the direct cerebellar tract, is continued superficially from the lateral column to the cerebellum.

The superficial arciform fibres (fig. 58, s) have already superficial, been noticed in the description of the exterior of the medulla oblongata (p. 194). The deep arciform fibres (h) are more numerous, and deep, and are seen over the whole area of transverse sections except in the pyramid. Some of them come to the surface on the inner side of, and through the olivary body, and join the super- ficial set. Others are deep in their whole extent, and pass outwards into the restifonn body, and to the nuclei of the cuneate and slender funiculi. Internally, the arciform fibres enter the raphe", through which they are continued to the opposite half of the medulla. There they are thought to become longitudinal, but of their farther course nothing certain is known. The raphe (fig. 58, between h and I) occupies the median plane Raphe, of the medulla oblongata above the decussation of the pyramids, and consists of fibres ranning obliquely, longitudinally, and from before backwards, which are in part continuous with the superficial and deep arciform fibres, and in part spring from the nuclei in the floor of the fourth ventricle.

In the dorsal portion of the medulla Reticular oblongata, behind the pyramid and olivary body (fig. 58, I and k), formatl0"- the longitudinal fibres derived from the anterior and lateral columns of the cord, decussating with the deep arciform fibres, give rise to a structure that is known as the reticular formation of the medulla. In the part of the reticular formation behind the olivary body (h) interspersed grey matter containing nerve-cells is also present. Olivary body (fig. 58, /). On removing a thin slice from the Olivary olivary body, it will be seen to consist of three parts, viz., an y* external investment of white substance, a thin grey layer—the olivary nucleus, and a central white core. The outer white layer consists mainly of transverse fibres, which belong to the superficial arciform group. The olivary nucleus or corpus dentatum is a thin plaited capsule its nucleus, or bag, having a zigzag outline in section. Towards the surface and behind it is closed, but on the inner side it is open, forming a narrow neck, which is turned towards the raphe', and gives passage to the olivary peduncle. The central white matter fills the grey capsule, and is formed by the spreading out of a tract of white fibres called the olivary and peduncle, which passes inwards through the opening in the nucleus i)edimcle- to the raphe". The fibres of the peduncle partly terminate in the cells of the corpus dentatum, and are partly continued through the grey layer to join the arciform fibres. Grey matter of the medulla oblongata. The larger part of the grey Grey matter matter in the medulla is a continuation of that of the cord, but of meduUa there are in addition some smaller independent masses. Prolongation of grey matter of the spinal cord. At the lower end prolonged of the medulla oblongata the central grey matter resembles that hi from cord- the spinal cord (fig. 129), but as it extends upwards it undergoes the following changes :—198 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Changes in anterior liorn, in posterior liorn, and in commissure, Special grey masses. Pons : position, form, surfaces, borders, and sides. It consists of ventral and dorsal portions. Dissection The anterior cornu is broken up by the passage through it of the fibres of the crossed pyramidal tract, and the detached extremity of the horn is continued upwards in the lateral tract for some distance as the lateral nucleus. The posterior cornu is pushed outwards by the increasing development of the slender and cuneate funiculi, and its extremity (caput), consistuig of the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando, becomes greatly enlarged and approaches the surface, giving rise to the funiculus and tubercle of Rolando (fig. 58, c). Prom the base of the horn, processes of the grey matter extend backwards into the slender and cuneate funiculi, and are known as the nuclei of those bodies. They are largest in the neighbourhood of the lower end of the fourth ventricle, where they cause the swellings which have been described above as the clava and cuneate tubercle (p. 193). By the opening out of the posterior median fissure and central canal of the cord to form the fourth ventricle, the anterior portion of the grey commissure and the bases of the anterior horns are exposed, constituting the grey layer in the floor of that cavity. Special deposits of grey matter. These are the olivary nucleus, which has just been examined, some groups of nerve-cells at the back of the medulla oblongata forming nuclei of origin for several cranial nerves, which will be noticed in connection with the anatomy of the fourth ventricle, and a few small masses of grey substance on the front of the medulla beneath the superficial arciform fibres (nuclei arciformes). Pons Varolii. The PONS varolii (annular protuberance, fig. 54) is situate above the medulla oblongata, and between the hemispheres of the cere- bellum. In its natural position in the skull it lies below the opening in the tentorium cerebelii, resting against the hinder part of the body of the sphenoid bone. It is nearly of a sepjare shape, though it is rather wider from side to side, in which direction it measures about an inch and a half. The anterior surface is convex and prominent on each side, but marked along the middle line by a groove in which the basilar artery lies. By the opposite surface the pons forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The upper border is the longer, and arches over the crura cerebri. The lower border is nearly straight, and projects above the medulla oblongata. On each side the pons is continued into the middle peduncle of the cerebellum, and the fifth nerve issues at the junction of the two. Structure. The ventral or anterior half of the pons consists of transverse fibres which are in part of their extent divided into two layers by the prolongation upwards of the fibres of the pyramids of the medulla oblongata. The dorsal or posterior half is a continua- tion of the reticular formation, with the grey layer of the floor of the fourth ventricle, from the medulla. Dissection.

Beneath them will appear the second or deep set of transverse fibres of the pons (fig. 57, f). The deep transverse fibres may next be cut through outside the pyramidal tract (fig. 57), and the reticular formation will then be seen, in which deep longitudinal fibres ascend from the medulla (fig. 57, d). The transverse fibres of the ventral portion of the pons are derived Transverse from the crus or middle peduncle of the cerebellum. They are yentra°f mostly collected into two layers, superficial and deep (fig. 57), portion, which enclose the longitudinal fibres of the pyramid ; but some transverse fibres pass between the bundles of the pyramidal tract. The superficial fibres are nearly horizontal in the lower part of the pons, but the upper ones descend to join the cerebellar peduncle, and some are seen on the surface crossing obliquely over the lower fibres. The pyramidal fibres enter the pons below as a single mass, but in Pyramidal their passage upwards through the pons they are broken up by de- p^1" cussating bundles of transverse fibres. Much increased in number, they emerge at the upper border of the pons, and are continued into the superficial portion (crusta) of the crus cerebri. Scattered amongst the transverse fibres are numerous small Grey matter masses of grey matter (nuclei pontis) ; and fibres entering the pons ^,^u,vem by one cerebellar peduncle are believed to cross to the other side, supposed and there join nerve-cells in these nuclei, from which other fibres course of fibres take origin, and ascend with the fibres of the pyramid to the crus cerebri The reticular formation of the pons is formed 1 longitudinal Formatio fibres continued from the medulla oblongata (p. 197), and passing reticulans- upwards to the deep portion (tegmentum) of the crus cerebri (fig. 57, d), decussating with transverse fibres which are also derived from the peduncle of the cerebellum. It contains much interspersed grey matter; and near the floor of the fourth ventricle there are several nerve-nuclei, which will be referred to when that cavity is described. In the dorsal portion of the pons, as in the medulla oblongata, Raphe, there is a median raphe, formed mainly by the transverse fibres changing their direction as they cross the middle line. There is farther in the lower part of the pons, close behind the Superior deep transverse fibres of the ventral portion, and occupying a olive- position immediately above the olivary body, a small collection of grey matter to which the name of superior olivary nucleus is given.200 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Section IY. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBRUM. Situation of the cerebrum. Form. Two haul- spheres, united by median parts. Under surface of cerebrum. Enumera- tion of central parts. Olfactory lobe. The cerebrum, or -great brain, the largest of the subdivisions of the encephalon, fills the upper part of the cranial cavity, and occupies the anterior and middle fossae of the base of the skull. Its hinder part rests on the tentorium, which separates it from the cerebellum. Its lower limit would be indicated on the surface of the head by a line from the eyebrow to the articulation of the jaw, and from this point to the external occipital protuberance. Taking the general form of the cranial cavity, the cerebrum is convex on the upper aspect, and uneven on the lower. It consists of two hemispheres, which are placed side by side, and separated in the greater part of their extent by a median longitudinal fissure. In their lower hall'the hemispheres are united by some commissures, as well as by several connecting parts at the under surface. The under part of each hemisphere is divided into two by a deep transverse cleft—the fissure of Sylvius. Under Surface or Base of the Cerebrum (fig. 59). The under surface of the cerebrum is- irregular, in consequence of its fitting into inequalities in the base of the skull; and on this aspect the separation into hemispheres is not so complete as on the upper, for the median fissure exists only at the front and back. The following objects are to be recognised at the centre of the base of the brain :— Immediately in front of the pons (d) are two large white masses, the peduncles of the cerebrum or crura cerebri (/), one belonging to each hemisphere ; and between them is a small area perforated by vessels, which is named the posterior perforated space (</). Crossing the peduncle is the optic tract; and between it and the inner part of the hemisphere is a fissure leading into the lateral ventricle. In front of the posterior perforated space are seen two rounded white bodies—the corpora albicantia (e) ; and then a prominent greyish mass, called tuber cinereum (h). From the tuber einereuni a conical process, the infundibulum, descends to the pituitary body in the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone. Anterior to the tuber cinereum are the converging optic tracts with their commissure (i). In front of the commissure lies a thin greyish layer—lamina cinerea (m) ; and still farther forwards is the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, with the white corpus callosum (n) in the bottom of it. At the inner end of the Sylvian fissure is a depression termed the vallecula Sylvii (I), at the bottom of which is seen another spot perforated by vessels—the anterior perforated space. Lastly, in front of the anterior perforated space, and resting on201 BASE OF CEREBRUM. the surface of the frontal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere, is the elongated process of the brain (o) named olfactory lobe, from which the °olfactory nerve-filaments spring. This process is frequently called the olfactory nerve, but its true nature as a lobe of the cerebrum is shown by its position and structure, as well as by its condition in the lower animals, in which it is generally of large size.

The peduncle consists of a superficial layer of white fibres, the crusta, continued from the longitudinal fibres of the pons, a prolongation of the reticular formation termed the tegmentum, and an intermediate stratum of grey matter—the substantia rvigra. Dissection. For the purpose of showing the structure of the eras on the right side (fig. 57), the optic tract should be divided, and the fibres continuous with the pyramid of the medulla oblongata should be raised as far as the junction of the eras with the hemisphere. In this proceeding the substantia nigra (g) will appear; and beneath it will be seen the tegmentum. The crusta is composed of coarse bundles of white fibres, ascending from the pons (fig. 56, c) to the cerebral hemisphere, where they enter a layer of white fibres termed the internal capsule, which will be subsequently seen. The continuation of the pyramidal hbres of the medulla (pyramidal tract) occupies the central part only of the crusta ; and the lateral parts consist of fibres which have been added in the pons. Those on the inner side pass to the frontal lobe of the hemisphere, while the outer ones are destined for the occipital and fcemporo-sphenoidal lobes. The substantia nigra (fig. 57, g) is a layer of dark grey matter' which separates the crusta from the tegmentum. In transverse sections it is seen to be convex towards the crusta, and thicker at the inner than at the outer side. The tegmentum is united internally with the like structure of the opposite side below; but above, the two are separated by the grey matter of the posterior perforated space. It consists of a reticular formation continuous with that of the pons, together with a con- siderable bundle of fibres derived from the cerebellum (superior peduncle of the cerebellum), in connection with which there is a roundish mass of grey substance named the nucleus of the tegmentum or reel nucleus. Above, the tegmentum joins the under surface of the optic thalamus. The posterior perforated space (fig. 59, g) is situate in the depres- sion between the crura cerebri. The bottom of this hollow is formed by a layer of grey matter, -which is perforated by the central branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. This structure forms the hinder part of the floor of the third ventricle. The corpora albicantia (corp. mamillaria; e) are two round white bodies, about the size of small peas, which are constructed in greater part by the crura of the fornix. If one, say the right, is cut across, it will lie seen to contain grey matter. The tuber cinereum (h) is a portion of the thin grey layer forming the floor of the third ventricle, -which is continuous behind with the grey matter of the posterior perforated space, and in front, above the optic commissure, with the lamina cinerea. It is convex on the surface, and is prolonged at its fore part into the following body. The infwidibulum is a funnel-shaped tube which readies from the tuber cinereum to the posterior lobe of the pituitary body.

The anterior is the larger, and is hollowed out behind, where it receives the round posterior lobe. In the adult this body is solid and firm in texture ; but in the foetus it is hollow, and the posterior lobe opens into the third ventricle through the infundibulum. Dissection. To see the lamina cinerea and the anterior end of the Dissection, corpus callosum, the hemispheres are to be gently separated from each other in front. The lamina cinerea (m) is a thin concave layer of grey substance, Grey lamina, which gradually tapers upwards from the tuber cinereum to the termination of the corpus callosum. This stratum closes the anterior part of the third ventricle, and is continuous laterally with the anterior perforated space. In consequence of its great tliinness, this structure is often broken through in removing the brain. The corpus callosum bent downwards in front, is continued Corpus horizontally backwards in the longitudinal fissure to the lamina caUosmn cinerea, and ends by two white narrow bands—the peduncles of the corpus callosum, which are continued along the edge of the lamina cinerea on each side to the anterior perforated spot. The anterior ends below bend of the corpus callosum is known as the genu, and to the {JaJ^° prolonged central part the name rostrum is given. Laterally this and extends part of the corpus callosum reaches into the frontal lobe, and forms ^Jf""" part of the floor of the lateral ventricle. " Vallecula Sylvii and anterior perforated space. The vallecula Vallecula Sylvii is a depression between the optic commissure and the fore 8ylvu- part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the hemisphere, which lodges the upper end of the internal carotid artery. Externally it leads into the Sylvian fissure, and in front it is bounded by the diverg- ing roots of the olfactory tract. The floor of the fossa is formed by a layer of grey matter which is perforated by the central Anterior branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, thus giving ^°e"' rise to the anterior perforated space. The grey substance is con- tinuous above with the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum. The Olfactory lobe consists of an elongated nerve-like part which Olfactory is named the olfactory tract, and a terminal expansion in front—the Iobe olfactory bulb. It lies in a groove (olfactory sulcus; fig. 61, ol) on lies in the surface of the inner orbital convolution of the frontal lobe of the """' ''"'.v hemisphere. suluus- The olfactory bulb (fig. 59, o) is an oval mass, of a greyish colour, oifeotory and nearly half an inch in length, which rests on the cribriform bulb- plate of the ethmoid bone. From its under surface the olfactory nerves arise. a ted204 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Olfactory tract: roots, outer and inner. Olfactory tubercle. Position of brain to examine upper part.

Convolu- tions vary, but plan is uniform. Division of the hemi- sphere. The olfactory tract is a prismatic Land, about an inch long, the upper edge of which is received into the olfactory sulcus. It is attached by its base, where it is somewhat expanded, to the frontal lobe close in front of the anterior perforated space ; and from this part two diverging white streaks, the roots of the olfactory tract or olfactory stria:, proceed to neighbouring convolutions. The external root passes along the outer margin of the anterior perforated space, and across the beginning of the Sylvian fissure, to the anterior extremity of the uncinate convolution in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The internal root, not always visible, bends inwards, and joins the lower end of the callosal convolution. By raising the olfactory lobe from its sulcus, the dorsal ridge will be seen to become enlarged at its posterior end, forming the olfactory tubercle. Position of the part. Now that the base of the cerebrum has been studied, the brain should be turned over for the examination of the upper part. Something should then be placed beneath the fore part, in order that it may be raised to the same level as the back; and a rolled-up cloth should loosely encircle the whole, to support the hemispheres. Upper Surface of the Cerebrum. Viewed from above, the cerebrum is ovoidal in form, and the upper surface is convex in accordance with the shape of the skull. A med/Um longitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum incompletely into halves. At the front and back the hemispheres are quite separated by it; but at the middle and under parts they are united by connecting bodies, the largest of which is the white corpus callosum. In the fissure the falx cerebri is lodged. Each hemisphere is larger in front than behind, although the greatest breadth of the cerebrum is placed behind the middle. Its outer surface is convex and applied to the skull; the inner is flat and rests against the falx cerebri. The surface of the hemisphere consists of grey matter (cortex of the cerebrum), and is marked by tortuous eminences separated by grooves. The eminences are named convolutions or gyri; the grooves are furrows or sulci. The sulci of the cerebrum are of two kinds. The greater number are superficial depressions which carry inwards the grey cortex and only indent the central white substance ; but a few penetrate more deeply, and these are the result of folds involving the whole thick- ness of both grey and white substance, so as to affect the form of the cavity (lateral ventricle) contained within the hemisphere, or give rise to eminences projecting on its wall. The sulci of the latter group are distinguished as fissures. The convolutions and sulci, especially the smaller ones, vary in different brains, and they are not exactly alike even in the two hemispheres of the same cerebrum. Their general arrangement or plan is, however, constant, and there will seldom be much dinicidty in recognizing the several parts referred to in the following de- scription. Interlobar Sulci and Lobes of the Hemisphere. The outer surface of the hemisphere is divided into regions, or groups of con-205 FISSUEE OF SYLVIUS. volutions, known as the lobes of the cerebrum, by means of some of the most constant sulci, aided by lines prolonged from these. The interlobar sulci are three in number, viz :— The fissure of Sylvius (fig. 60, s) begins at the vallecula Sylvii, Sylvian whence it extends transversely outwards across the under surface of the hemisphere, separating the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes (fitf. 59). As soon as it reaches the outer surface, it gives off one lias three small branch forwards (anterior; fig. 60, s'), and another upwards m"cies- (ascending; s"), with project into the inferior frontal convolution, Fig. 60.* and is then continued backwards as the posterior branch («"') through about the middle third of the hemisphere. The posterior branch separates the temporo-sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes ; it ascends somewhat as it runs backwards ; and at its termination it is bent upwards for a short distance and projects into the parietal lobe.

Central lobe, or island of Refl, The furrow of Rolando (central sulcus ; fig. 60, r) crosses the outer surface of the hemisphere near the middle. Beginning above close to the margin of the great longitudinal fissure, the furrow runs downwards and somewhat forwards, with a serpentine course, to end about one inch behind the place of division of the Sylvian fissure, and very near to its posterior limb. This sulcus is used to separate the frontal from the parietal lobe. The upper end of the furrow of Rolando is placed from an inch- and-a-half to two inches, the lower end about one inch behind the coronal suture. The parieto-occipital fissure (fig. 61, po) is a deep sulcus at the hinder part of the inner surface of the hemisphere. Its upper end appears on the superior surface of the cerebrum about midway between the preceding sulcus and the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, and extends outwards for nearly an inch from the margin of the longitudinal fissure (fig. 60, po). It ■ indicates the anterior limit of the occipital lobe. The parieto-occipital fissure is placed opposite the summit of the lambdoid suture. Lobes. The outer surface of the hemisphere is divided into five lobes (excluding the olfactory) which haA'e the following names and limits :— The frontal hie forms the anterior half of the hemisphere. It is limited below by the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius (fig. 60, s"), and behind by the furrow of Rolando (?•). Its under part, which rests on the roof of the orbit, is named the orbital lobule. The parietal lobe is little more than half the size of the frontal. Its anterior limit is the luridw of Rolando (r), and its posterior a line drawn transversely over the hemisphere from the parieto-occipital fissure. Below, it is bounded in its fore part by the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius (*"'), and in its hinder part by a line extending from the spot where this sulcus turns upwards to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere. Its convolutions are con- tinuous with those of the occipital lobe behind, and of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe below. The occipital lobe is small, and triangular in shape. It is separated from the parietal lobe for a short distance above by the parieto- occipital fissure (po); but its anterior boundary is for the most part artificial, being constituted by a line continuing the direction of that fissure, across the outer surface of the hemisphere. Its convolutions join those of the parietal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe projects into the middle fossa of the base of the skull. Its fore part is separated from the frontal and \ parietal lobes by the fissure of Sylvius, but its hinder part is only limited by the lines above mentioned, across which its con- volutions pass into those of the parietal and occipital lobes. The central lobe, insula, or island of Reil (fig. 61, c), is placed at I the bottom of the fissure of Sylvius, and is concealed by the over- lapping of the temporo-sphenoidal, parietal and frontal lobes. If the207 INSULA AND FRONTAL LOBE. margins of the Sylvian fissure be drawn asunder, it will be seen to have a triangular form, with the apex directed downwards towards the anterior perforated space, and to be bounded by three furrows, the sulci of Reil (ar, er, and pr), the hinder of which is continuous with the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius. Fig. 61.* The central lobe is placed opposite the corpus stria- tum in the interior of the hemisphere. To the portions of the frontal and parietal lobes which are placed between the ascending and posterior branches of the fissure of Sylvius (fig. 60, between s" and s"), and cover the upper part of the central lobe, the name operculum of the insula is given (fig. 61). Sulci and convolu- tions OF THE FRONTAL lobe. On the outer surface of the frontal lobe there are four convolutions, separated by three sulci. The prmcentral sulcus (fig. 60, pr c) is placed in front of, and nearly parallel to, the lower half of the furrow of Rolando. From it the inferior frontal sulcus (if) runs forwards and downwards, towards the orbital surface of the lobe. Above this, the superior frontal sulcus (sf), which is often inter- rupted once or twice by cross gyri, takes a similar course. The ascending frontal convolution (af) is simple, and forms the hindmost part of the frontal lobe, extending from the upper margin of the hemisphere to the Sylvian fissure, along the front of the fur- row of Rolando. From its fore part the three longitudinal convolu- tions of this lobe take their origin. The superior frontal convolution (sf) is longer and broader than the others, and is commonly much subdivided into secondary gyri.

The orbital lobule is subdivided by a Y or H-shaped orbital sulcus (orb) into three convolutions, named internal (io), anterior (ao), and posterior (po) orbital, which are the continuation respectively of the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions. On the internal orbital convolution is a longitudinal groove—olfactory sulcus (ol), for the reception of the olfactory lobe. Sulci and convolutions of the parietal lobe. In the parietal lobe there are two named sulci; and four convolutions are dis- tinguished. The intraparietal sulcus (ip) begins close to the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius, about midway between the upturned extremity of this and the lower end of the furrow of Rolando. It first ascends, running nearly parallel to the lower half of the latter sulcus, and then is directed backwards to the hinder limit of the parietal lobe, where it often becomes continuous with the superior occipital sulcus. The upper part of the intraparietal furrow is frequently interrupted by one or two cross gyri. The postcentral sulcus (ptc) continues the direction of the ascending stage of the intraparietal sulcus behind the upper half of the furrow of Rolando. It generally opens into the intraparietal sulcus at the spot where the latter changes its direction. The ascending parietal convolution (ap) is placed opposite the as- cending frontal, and like that is simple, and extends from the upper margin of the hemisphere to the posterior branch of the Sylvian fis- sure. In front of it is the furrow of Rolando, round the ends of which it joins the ascending frontal convolution. Behind, it is limited by the postcentral sulcus above, and the transverse part of the intra- parietal sulcus below. Parietal lobules. The larger portion of the parietal lobe behind the foregoing convolution is divided into two parietal lobules by the longitudinal part of the intraparietal sulcus. The superior parietal lobule (spl) is connected in front to the upper end of the ascending parietal convolution between the postcentral sulcus and the upper margin of the hemisphere, and behind to the upper occipital convo- lution by a small winding gyrus which is called the first annectant convolution (below po). This lobule is divided into several secondary gyri. The inferior parietal lobule is again subdivided into two convolu- tions, but the separation between them is often very indistinct. The supramarginal convolution (sm) is the anterior and larger of these : it springs in front from the lower end of the ascending parietal convolution, encircles the extremity of the posterior branchOUTER CEREBRAL CONVOLUTIONS. 209 of the Sylvian fissure, and ends by joining the superior temporo- sphenoidal convolution.

The middle temporo-sphenoidal sulcus (mt) takes a similar course at a middle, and lower level, but it is not so constant as the superior ; and the inferior (fig. 62, it), which, is also very variable, is placed on the inferior, under surface of the hemisphere near the margin, separating the lower temporo-sphenoidal from the external occipito-temporal convolution. The superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution (inframarginal; st) ^j™™1"" forms the lower boundary of the posterior branch of the Sylvian also three, fissure, and is continuous behind with the supramarginal convolu- tion. The middle and inferior tempm-o-sphenoidal convolutions (mt and it) are commonly united in some part of their extent.

The convolutions of the inner aspect of the hemisphere, with which are included those of the lowe 1' surface inner and behind the fissure of Sylvius, are generally well defined ; but some being so long as to reach beyond the extent of a single lobe of the outer surface, they are not usually described as forming lobes like the fore"oin2.DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 210 How to see Dissection, The parts to be now described can only be seen satisfactorily on a separate hemisphere ; but if the student possesses only the one brain, he may show much of the inner surface by cutting off the left hemisphere as low as the corpus callosum. marginal Solci.

Its fore part is frequently interrupted by one or two small gyri uniting the adjacent convolutions. The parieto-occipital or perpendicular fissure (fig. 62, po) is a deep cleft which descends from the upper margin of the hemisphere at the back part, with a slight inclination forwards, to join the follow- ing sulcus on a level with the hinder end of the corpus callosum. The calcarine fissure (c) is nearly horizontal. It begins close to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, and is directed forwards, receiving the parieto-occipital fissure about the middle of its length, to end a little below the splenium of the corpus callosum. It gives rise to the eminence called calcar avis' in the lateral ventricle, whence its name. * Sulci and convolutions of the inner aspect of the hemisphere. Sulci: cm. Calloso-marginal. po.

The hippocampal or dentate fissure (h) is placed in front of the Hippocam- forcoing, at the inner margin of the lower portion of the hemi- p ll83Ure- sphere, and separates the uncinate convolution (u) from the taenia hippocampi (th). It corresponds to the hippocampus major in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and its relations will be better seen when that body is examined. The collateral fissure (coll) gives rise to the collateral eminence Collateral in the lateral ventricle. It extends from near the posterior extremity of the hemisphere to the fore part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and is frequently broken up into two or three parts by cross gyri. Convolutions. The marginal convolution (m) occupies the space Marginal between the calloso-marginal sulcus and the border of the hemi- tion. sphere. It is much subdivided, and at its posterior extremity a small portion which is marked off by a short vertical furrow is distinguished as the oval or paracentral lobule. The marginal con-Oval lobule, volution is continuous over the border of the hemisphere with the internal orbital and superior frontal convolutions, while the oval lobule is formed by the upper end of the ascending frontal convolu- tion. The callosal convolution (gyrus fornicatus ; Call) is narrower and ^""^ simpler than the marginal. Beginning below the rostrum of the corpus corpus callosum, this convolution follows the curve of that body, callosum. and turns downwards behind its posterior extremity to end in a thin part which joins the uncinate convolution (u). It is bounded in the greater part of its extent by the calloso-marginal sulcus, but behind the spot where this furrow turns upwards it is continuous with the quadrate lobule (q). Near its ending, it is limited below by the calcarine fissure. The quadrate lobule (q) is placed between the end of the calloso- Quadrate marginal sulcus and the parieto-occipital fissure. Much subdivided by secondary furrows, it reaches the margin of the hemisphere above, where it is continuous with the superior parietal lobule, and joins the callosal convolution below. The cuneate lobule (occipital lobule; C'un) is triangular in shape, Cuneate the base being formed by the margin of the hemisphere. In frontlob,Ue- of it is the parieto-occipital, and below the calcarine fissure. Small irregular sulci divide it into secondary gyri. The uncinate or interned occipitotemporal convolution (u) extends Uncinate from the posterior extremity of the hemisphere to the Sylvian convolutlon- fissure, being bounded by the calcarine and hippocampal fissures above, and by the collateral fissure below. It is somewhat narrowed in the middle, where the callosal convolution joins it, and enlarged in front and behind. At its fore part is a small piece (uncus) bent backwards over the lower end of the dentate fissure, from which the convolution derives its name.

Structure of the convolutions. Each convolution is continuous with the general mass of the hemisphere on the one side (base), and is free on the other, where it presents a summit and lateral surfaces, which are covered by pia mater. A cross section will show its constitution of a layer of cortical grey substance on the surface, which is continued at the bottom of the sulci from one eminence to another, and a white medullary part in the centre, which appears as a process of the large medullary mass forming the greater part of the substance of the hemisphere. On examining closely the section of a convolution in a fresh specimen, the cortex may generally be seen to consist of three grey, and as many thinner white, layers arranged alternately, the outermost being a thin white stratum, which is most marked over the fore part of the uncinate convolution. Interior of the Cerebrum. Each cerebral hemisphere consists (if white and grey substance, the white forming the larger portion of the mass (medullary centre of the hemisphere), while the grey matter is chiefly disposed in a superficial layer (cortex) which covers the medullary centre, except over the region on the inner side whence the corpus callosum issues ; but at the lower part of the hemisphere there are other collections of grey matter more or less surrounded by the medullary substance. In each hemisphere is an elongated cavity, named the lateral ventricle, which communicates with another median space—the third ventricle, placed close to the base of the brain. The student will now proceed to examine the parts in the interior of the hemisphere, carrying the dissection from above downwards. Dissection. Supposing both hemispheres entire, the left is to be cut off to the level of the calloso-marginal sulcus. When this has been done, the surface displays a white central mass of a semi-oval shape (centrum ovale minus), sending processes into the convolu- tions, and surrounded by an irregular grey margin. In a fresh brain this surface would be studded with drops of blood escaping from the divided vessels. Next, the callosal convolution is to be divided about the middle, and the two pieces are to be thrown backwards and forwards. On its under surface will be seen a thin band of white fibres, the covered band of Eeil or fillet of the corpus callosum, which bends down before and behind the corpus callosum. A similar dissection is to be carried out on the opposite side ; and the hemisphere being removed to the level of the corpus callosum, the transverse fibres of that body are to be defined as they radiate to the convolutions. Now a much larger white surface comes into view (centrum ovale majus) and the white masses in the two hemispheres are seen to be continuous, across the middle line, through the corpus callosum. The. corpus callosum reaches from one half of the cerebrum to the other, and forms the roof of the lateral ventricle in each hemisphere.CORPUS CALLOSUM. 2V6 Its central part, which is exposed in the longitudinal fissure, is very situation, narrow, and measures about three inches in length. It is nearer to extent and the anterior than to the posterior end of the cerebrum, and is some-form- what arched from before backwards. On each side its upper surface is free for a short distance beneath the callosal convolution, from which it is separated by a groove. In front, the corpus callosuni is bent downwards (tig. 02), forming Anterior the genu and rostrum as before described (p. 203) ; and behind, it posterior ends in a thickened part named the splenium. ends. The fibres of the corpus callosum are for the most part directed Fibres transversely, but on the upper surface there is a somewhat irregular, transverse ; narrow longitudinal band on each side close to the middle line (striae tndhiai°ngl" longitudinales or nerves of Lancisi). Between the two bands is a median groove or raphe. Farther out there may be seen other longitudinal fibres belonging to the covered band, if that has not been completely removed. The longitudinal striae are prolonged downwards in front, and form the peduncles of the corpus callosum (p. 203). Dissection. In order to see the thickness of the corpus callosum, Dissection, and to bring into view the parts in relation with its under surface, a cut is to be made through it on the right side about half an inch from the raphe ; and this is to be extended forwards and backwards, as far as the limits of the underlying ventricle. While cutting through the corpus callosum, the student may observe that a thin membraniform structure (ependvma) lines its under surface. The corpus callosum is thicker at each end than at the centre, in is thickened consequence of a greater number of fibres being collected from the at each end" cerebrum ; and the posterior part is the thickest of all. Connected Ull'Jer surl(iC6 with its under surface along the middle is the septum lucidum or partition between the ventricles (fig. 63, b) at the fore part, and the fornix (c) behind. This is the chief commissural body of the halves of the cerebrum, and its fibres pass laterally into the medullary centre of the hemi- sphere, in which they radiate to the convolutions. Dissection. The left lateral ventricle is to be now opened in the Dissection, same way as the right; and to prepare for the examination of the cavity on the right side, as much of the corpus callosum as forms the roof of the space is to be removed. A part of the ventricle extends down hi the temporo-sphenoidal lobe towards the base of the brain; and to open it, a cut is to be carried outwards and down- wards, through the substance of the hemisphere, along the course of the hollow. (See fig. 63.) Ventricles of the brain.

The inferior or descending comu leaves the hinder part of the Middle body of the ventricle opposite the splenium of the corpus callosum, 110111: and runs downwards and forwards in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, direction; describing a curve with the convexity outwards. In the roof are roof; contained the fibres passing from the hinder end of the corpus callosum downwards and outwards into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, together with the prolongations of the caudate nucleus and tamia semicircularis. The floor is formed mainly by a long and floor, curved eminence—the hippocampus major (Z), along the inner margin of which is a thin band prolonged from the fornix—the tamia hippo- campi, while to its outer side lies the tapering fore part of the eminentia collateralis. The choroid plexus is continued downwards along the inner side to the lower extremity of this cornu. The septum lucidum (fig. 63, b) is placed vertically between the Septum two lateral ventricles, beneath the anterior half of the corpusluc»dum: callosum, to which its upper border is attached. It is triangular in P0Sltlon> shape, with the base turned downwards and forwards, and fixed to attIicii-Ud the rostrum of the corpus callosum. The posterior border ismenta i oblique, and joins the fornix. Its surfaces look into the lateral ventricles, opposite the head of the caudate nucleus. Although so thin as to be translucent, the septum lucidum consists of two laminae which enclose a space—the fifth ventricle. Each lamina is a double La composed of white substance, with a thin layer of grey matter Petition, internally ; and the ependyma of the lateral ventricle covers its fifth • 8 outer surface. ventricle.216 DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN.

The fifth ventricle will be exposed by cutting through the piece of the corpus callosum which remains in the middle line, and detaching the anterior half from the septum lueidum. The fifth ventricle (vent, of the septum) is a narrow slit in the fore part of the septum lueidum, where this is deeper. Posteriorly and above, the lamina? of the septum are united to a variable extent. Like the septum, it is larger in front than behind. This cavity has not any epithelial lining. Dissection. The fornix is to be next examined. To lay bare this body the posterior part of the corpus callosum should be detached with care from it, and thrown backwards ; and the septum lueidum should also be removed from its upper surface. The fornix (fig. 63, c) is a thin white layer beneath the corpus callosum, which, projecting on each side into the lateral ventricle, forms part of the floor of that cavity. Its central part or body is triangular in shape, with the base turned backwards ; and it is con- tinuous with the rest of the brain by processes named crura, in front and behind. The upper surface of the body has the septum lueidum attached to it along the middle line in front; and behind, its median part is united to the corpus callosum. Each border is free in the corre- sponding lateral ventricle, where it rests on the optic thalamus, the velum interposition being between the two ; and along it lies the choroid plexus. At its base it joins the corpus callosuni in the middle, while on each side it sends off a small riband-like band— the posterior cms or twnia hippocampi (fig. 64, c), along the concave margin of the hippocampus major. At the anterior end it is arched over the foramen of Monro, opposite the front of the optic thalamus, and ends likewise in two processes or crura, which Mall 1 ie afterwards followed to the corpora albicantia and the optic thalami (p. 224). If the fornix be cut across near its front, the foramen of Monro will be opened, and the descending anterior pillars will be seen (fig. 64). When the posterior part is raised, it will be found to be supported on a process of the pia mater, named velum interposition. And near its base, on the under aspect, is a triangular surface, marked by transverse lines, which are produced by the fibres of the corpus callosum appearing in the interval between the two diverging longitudinal bands of the fornix : the part which is so defined has been called the lyra (fig. 64, a). The fornix may be described as consisting of two bands, right and left, which are united for a certain distance in the central part or body. According to this view each band, commencing in the Foramen of Monro. optic thalamus and passing through the corpus albicans, arches over the foramen of Monro, and after forming the body of the fornix, is continued as the taenia hippocampi to the hook of the uncinate convolution. The foramen of Monro is a short slit between the fore part of the fornix and the optic thalamus. Through it the lateral ventricle communicates with the third ventricle, and indirectly with the one217 HIPPOCAMPUS MAJOR. of the opposite side. It is lined by a prolongation of the ependyma, which is thus continued from one ventricle to the other. The student may leave untouched for the present the velum interpositum, and proceed to examine the bodies which have been enumerated in the Moor of the posterior and descending comua. The hippocampus minor or calcar avis (fig. 63, i) is a spindle- Hippocam- shaped prominence on the inner side of the posterior cornu of the Pusnunor> lateral ventricle. If it is cut across, it will be seen to be formed by the calcarine fissure pushing outwards the wall of the cavity formed by (p. 210), and beneath the white layer is the cortical grey substance nssm-e"0 passing from the uncinate convolution to the cuneate lobule at the bottom of the fissure. The hippocampus major (fig. 63, I) is the large convex eminence ffippocam- in the floor of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and like pua 1"'l|ni- that is curved, with the concavity directed inwards. Its anterior extremity, which is named pes hippocampi, is somewhat enlarged, and presents two or three indentations, resembling the foot of a feline animal. Along the inner margin of the hippocampus is the tccuia hippo- Taenia hippo- campi or fimbria (fig. 64, c), which is prolonged from the fornix ; this ends below by joining the small recurved part of the uncinate convolution (p. 211). Dissection. To examine more fully the hippocampus, the hinder Dissection, portions of the corpus callosum and fornix should be divided in the middle line, and the posterior part of the right hemisphere should be drawn away from the rest of the brain. When the pia mater has been removed from the inner side of the hippocampus, and this projection has been cut across, its structure will be seen. The hippocampus is covered on the ventricular surface by a Structure thin medullary layer, with which the taenia blends. On its opposite campus? surface is the hollow of the hippocampal fissure of the exterior of the brain, which is lined by grey substance. Beneath the taenia hippocampi the grey matter projects in the form of a notched ridge, the fascia dentata: this is external to the cavity of the ventricle, and has been named the dentate convolution (p. 212). The eminentia collateralis (fig. 63, Jc) is the triangular, slightly Collateral convex surface occupying the floor of the posterior and descending emmence' comua of the lateral ventricle to the outer side of the hippocampi. It lies over the collateral fissure of the under surface of the hemi- formed by sphere ; and its extent varies greatly in different subjects. nssure.'"1 Transverse fissure of tlie cerebrum.

The student is now to return to the examination of the parts in the centre of the brain, viz., the fold of pia mater and its vessels, with the third ventricle. Afterwards the corpus striatum and optic thalamus will be studied. The velum interpositum (fig. 64, g) is the fold of pia mater entering the great transverse fissure.

In reflecting the piece of pia mater the student must be careful not to detach the pineal body (</) behind, which is surrounded by the membrane. On the under surface of the velum are seen the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. The choroid plexuses of the third ventricle are two short and narrow Choroid fringed bodies below the velum, which resemble the like structures third868 °f in the lateral ventricle. ventricle.

In the floor, in front, there is a depression opposite the infundibulum, where the cavity at an early period of fcetal life was prolonged into the pituitary body. The ependyma lining the ventricle is continued into the neigh-^ingof bouring cavities through the different apertures of communication, and its epithelium is continued over the choroid plexuses in the roof. Grey matter df tlie ventricle. A stratum of grey matter forms the Grey matter lower part of the wall of the ventricle. Portions of this layer ventricle, appearing at the base of the brain constitute the posterior perforated space, the tuber cinereum and the lamina cinerea. It also extends into the corpus albicans, forming the nucleus of that body. At the fore part of each optic thalamus it covers the cms of the fornix, and ascends to the septum lucidum. In the middle of the space it reaches from side to side, and forms the soft commissure (d).

Dissection. To show the composition of the corpus striatum, the Dissection, upper part of that body and of the optic thalamus should be sliced off on the right side, until a view resembling that in fig. 66 is obtained. The superficial anatomy of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus may be studied on the left side. The caudate or intraventricular nucleus (fig. 65, a) is a long pyriform Caudate mass of reddish-grey substance which projects into the lateral shows in ventricle. Its larger extremity or liead (fig. 66, cu) is turned J?^™^ forwards, and forms the floor of the anterior cornu of the ventricle. The middle tapering portion is directed backwards and outwards, along the outer side of the optic thalamus, beneath the body of the ventricle, and ends in the tail (fig. 66, cn), which bends downwards and is prolonged in the roof of the descending cornu of the cavity, nearly to its anterior extremity. Numerous veins run over the Veins on surface of the caudate nucleus, and they may be seen to join a slu'face- larger vessel (vein of the corpus striatum) which lies along the groove between the caudate nucleus and optic thalamus. The lenticular or extraventricular nucleus (fig. 66, In) is entirely Lenticular surrounded by white matter, and is placed opposite the bottom of onl^seenin the fissure of Sylvius and the insula (i) of the exterior of the hemi- sections; sphere. It appeal's lens-shaped in horizontal section, but triangular, with the base turned outwards, when cut transversely. Internally, it is separated from the caudate nucleus and optic thalamus by the surrounded internal capsule ; and externally and below, it is bounded by a X^'ie.6 thinner white layer named the external capsule (ec). The internal capsule (fig. 66) is a thick layer of white fibres, which internal is seen in the horizontal section to form a bend—genu (icg), opposite capsulc'222 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. parts, the groove between the optic thalamus and the head of the caudate nucleus.

The internal capsule is formed in large part by the fibres of the crusta of the crus cerebri coursing upwards to the medullary centre of the hemisphere, but many fibres are added from the nuclei on each side.

On the outer side of the external capsule, separating that from Olaustrura. the medullary substance of the convolutions of the insula, is a third portion of grey matter, a thin layer which appears as a slightly wavy line in sections : this is named the claustrvm (fig. 66, cl). The tcenia semicircularis (fig. 63, /) is a narrow whitish band of Taenia semi- longitudinal fibres, which lies along the groove between the caudate cu'culans- nucleus and the optic thalamus. In front, the band becomes broader and joins the pillar of the fornix ; behind, it is continued with the tail of the caudate nucleus into the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, at the lower end of which it joins the cortical grey matter. Dissection. The anterior commissure is next to be exposed in its Anterior course through the cerebral hemisphere. For this purpose the gu™™8" remaining fore part of the caudate nucleus, the white fibres, and the dissection lenticular nucleus, on the right side, must be successively scraped to snow lt; away with the handle of the scalpel, and the rounded band traced outwards from the spot where it is seen at the front of the third ventricle to the medullary centre of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The anterior commisswre is a round bundle of white fibres about its form, as large as a crow-quill, which is free only for about an eighth of an inch in the middle of its extent, where it lies in front of the position, pillars of the fornix (fig. 65, c). Laterally, it passes outwards beneath the corpus striatum, lying between the lenticular nucleus and course, and the grey matter of the anterior perforated space, and curving back- wards, spreads out in the white substance of the temporo-sphenoidal ending, lobe above the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. The optic thalamus (fig. 65, h) is an oval-shaped body which takes Optic part in bounding the lateral and third ventricles. Its upper sur-tualai,ms > face is marked by a shallow oblique groove, which corresponds to "arilm the edge of the fornix. The part of the surface inside the groove is in contact with the velum interpositum ; but the narrower outer part is free in the floor of tin; lateral ventricle, and is covered by the ependyma of that cavity : at its anterior end it forms a slight pro- minence known as the tubercle of the optic thalamus. Externally this surface is bounded by the taenia semicircularis, which separates it from the caudate nucleus. The inner surface is for the most part inner free, forming the lateral wall of the third ventricle, but near the surface' middle it is united to the one of the opposite side by the soft com- missure. Along the line of junction of the upper and internal sur- faces is a narrow white streak—the pineal atria (/), which springs behind from the stalk of the pineal body, and ends in front by join- ing the anterior pillar of the fornix. The under surface is concealed, except at its hindmost part, by the iower .„„, cms cerebri, the tegmentum of which joins the thalamus ; and on externa] the outer side it is separated from the lenticular nucleus by the surlace8' posterior limb of the internal capsule (fig. 66, icp). The anterior end of the optic thalamus bounds the foramen of antorior and Monro. The posterior end is much larger, and projects above the °rDISSECTION OP THE LEA IN. 224 superior (juad^geminal body (fig. 65, h) and eras cerebri, being covered by the pia mater : internally it forms a considerable pro- minence called the pulvinar; and below and outside this is a smaller oval elevation named the external geniculate body. structure. In the section that has been made on the right side (fig. 66), the optic thalamus is seen to be composed of dark grey matter ; but it appears white on the upper surface, the grey substance being here covered by a thin medullary layer. A faint white line, which bifurcates in front, divides the grey mass into three portions—a small anterior, and larger internal and external nuclei. Dissection. Dissection. The origin of the fornix in the optic thalamus may now be followed out. As a preparatory step the anterior com- missure, the front of the corpus callosum, and the commissure of the optic nerves should be cut along the middle line, so that the fore parts of the hemispheres can be separated from one another. On the left hemisphere the eras of the fornix is to be traced down- wards through the grey matter of the third ventricle to the corpus albicans, and thence upwards into the optic thalamus. Origin of The anterior pillar of the fornix is joined below the foramen of fornix. Monro by the fibres of the taenia semicircularis and pineal stria, and then curves downwards and backwards in front of the optic thalamus, through the grey matter of the third ventricle, to the corpus albicans. Here it makes a turn like half of the figure 8, furnishing a white envelope to the grey matter of that body. Finally it ascends to the fore part of the optic thalamus, in the anterior nucleus of which its fibres end. The bodies lying behind the third ventricle, viz., the corpora quadrigemina, the pineal body, and the posterior commissure may lie next examined. Dissection. Dissection. All the pia mater should be carefully removed from the1 surface of the quadrigeminal bodies, especially on the right side, on which they are to be seen. The posterior part of the hemisphere of the same side may be taken away. Midbrain. . The constricted portion of the brain between the optic thalami above and the pons and cerebellum below is known as the isthmus cerebri or mesencephalon, and occupies, when the brain is in the skrdl, the aperture of the tentorium. The dorsal part of the mesencephalon is formed by a layer which is marked on the surface by four eminences—the corpora quadrigemina, and is therefore named the lamina quadrigemina. The ventral part of the mid- brain is much larger, constituting the crura cerebri which have already been examined. The lamina quadrigemina is separated from the crura in the middle by a canal—the • aqueduct of Sylvius; but on each side it is united with the tegmentum. The corpora qucdrigem'iha (fig. 65) are four prominent bodies, an upper and a lower pair, which are separated by a crucial groove. The superior eminence (nates ; h) is the larger, and is rather oval in shape. The inferior (testis ; i) is smaller, but more prominent, and rounded ; it is also whiter in colour than the upper one. From the outer side of each quadrigeminal body a white band, Inachivm,MESENCEPHALON. 225 is continued outwards and forwards : the upper brachium passes into the optic tract; while the lower band sinks beneath a small but Internal well defined oval prominence, which is placed between the cms cerebri body, and the optic thalamus, and is named the internal geniculate body. The quadrigeminal bodies are small masses of grey substance, covered by a white layer. From the grey matter of the upper one fibres of the optic tract take origin. Behind the quadrigeminal bodies are seen the superior peduncles Below of the cerebellum (fig. 65, I; 70, sp) with the valve of Vieussens jfueulfseen. (fig. 65, k) between them. Issuing from beneath the transverse fibres of pons, and arching over the cerebellar peduncle, is an oblique, slightly raised band named the fillet (fig. 70, /), which disappears under the lower quadrigeminal body. The fillet is a white fibrous tract, the origin of which is uncertain, Fillet: but which appears in sections of the upper part of the pons between the reticular formation and the deep transverse fibres. At the upper edge of the pons the outer fibres become superficial, and curving round the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, pass to the outer or quadrigeminal bodies, in which many of the fibres are lost, while part; others decussate in the lamina quadrigemina, above the aqueduct of Sylvius, with those of the opposite side. The inner fibres of the inner or fillet maintain their deep position, and are continued upwards in deep part' the tegmentum to the cerebral hemisphere. The origin of the optic tract can now be seen. At the outer side Optic tract of the cms cerebri the optic tract forms a bend (genu), and then "atls fr°m divides into two parts. The inner and smaller of these springs geniculate from the internal geniculate body ; while the outer is continued thalamus, from the external geniculate body and optic thalamus, receiving also the brachium of the superior quadrigeminal body. The posterior commissure (fig. 65, e) is the thin foremost part of Posterior the lamina quadrigemiua, which is folded back so as to present a commissure- rounded margin in front towards the third ventricle, above the opening of the aqueduct of Sylvius. On each side it joins the optic thalamus, and to its upper part the stalk of the pineal body is attached. It consists mainly of decussating fibres continuous with those of the fillet; but some are said to be commissural, uniting the tegmenta of the two sides. The pineal body (conarium ; fig. 65, g) is ovoidal in shape, like Pineal the cone of a pine, and about a quarter of an inch in length. It lies sland ' with its base turned forwards in the groove between the superior quadrigeminal bodies. It is surrounded by pia mater ; and its base is attached by a hollow white stalk, below to the posterior commis- sure, and above to the optic thalamus on each side, along which it sends forwards the thin band already described as the pineal stria (/; P- 223). This body is of a red colour and very vascular. It is not structure, composed of nervous substance, but consists of small follicles lined by epithelium, and containing minute granular masses of calcareous matter (brain-sand) : similar concretions are often found on its surface, and adhering to its stalk.DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 226 Aqueduct of Sylvius. Three sets of fibres in cerebral hemisphere. Ascending fibres ; The aqueduct of Syhius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum) is a narrow passage, about five-eighths of an inch long, uniting the third and fourth ventricles. It is lined by ependyma, external to which is a layer of grey matter continuous with that of the floor of the two cavities. Fibres of the cerebrum. In the cerebral hemispheres three systems of fibres are distinguished, viz., ascending, transverse, and longitudinal. The ascending are derived in large part from the spinal cord and the lower portions of the encephalon ; the transverse and longitudinal connect together parts of the cerebrum. Ascending or ■peduncular fibres (fig. 67). The longitudinal fibres entering the mid-brain from the pons are collected into two sets, Fig. 67.* which are contained respectively hi the crusta and the tegmentum. their origin. In this region they are reinforced by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and by fibres derived from the corpora quadrigemina, as well as by others springing from the grey nuclei of the crura. Fibres of Th.e fibres of the crusta enter the internal capsule ; and while some (including the pyramidal tract) are continued without interruption through this into the medullary centre of the hemisphere, others j>ass into the lenticular and caudate nuclei, and fresh fibres are mid of added from those bodies.

Dissection. A complete systematic view of the ascending fibres Dissection cannot now be obtained on the imperfect brain. At this stage the 0 em chief purpose is to show the passage of the radiating fibres from the crus through the large cerebral ganglia. To trace the ascending fibres through the corpus striatum, the intheoorpu caudate nucleus of this body should be scraped away (fig. 67) ;s m ^ and the dissection should be made on the left side, on which the striate body and the optic thalamus remain uncut. In this pro- ceeding the internal capsule comes into view, consisting of white fibres with intervening gray matter of the corpus striatum, giving the appearence of the teeth of a comb (pecten of Reil). On taking away completely the hinder part of the caudate nucleus, others of the same set of fibres will be seen issuing from the outer side of the optic thalamus, and radiating to the posterior and inferior portions of the hemisphere. Arrangement of the ascending fibres. The fibres of the internal Ascending capsule diverge as the}- pasa through the grey matter of the corpus SuUnSpiead striatum, and at the outer margin of that body they enter the hemisphere, medullary centre of the hemisphere, where they decussate with the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum, and radiate to all parts of the hemisphere. The ascending fibres thus form in the hemisphere a part of a hollow cone, named the corona radiata, the apex of forming which is towards the crus cerebri, and the concavity turned down- ^diTto wards. The base of the cone is at the surface of the hemisphere, where the fibres pass into the grey cortex of the convolutions. From the foregoing description it will be evident that the fibres constituting the corona radiata are of two kinds, viz., those extend- ing without interruption from the cortex to the isthmus cerebri, and those uniting the cortex with the corpus striatum and optic thalamus. The transverse or commissural fibres connect the hemispheres of the Transverse cerebrum across the median plane. They give rise to the great ',brc3' commissure or the corpus callosum (p. 212), and to the anterior commissure (p. 223). These bodies have already been examined. Longitudinal or collateral fibres. These are connecting fibres Longitnd- which pass from before backwards, uniting together parts of the "ml "bres" same hemisphere. The chief bands of this system are the follow- ing :—The fornix, the tamia seniicircularis, the pineal stria, the longitudinal stria of the corpus callosum, and the covered band of Reil. Other fibres pass in the medidlary centre between adjoining, and more distant convolutions, describing arches beneath the sidci: these are known as the association-fibres.

Section V. THE CEREBELLUM. Prepare cerebellum. Parts to lie separated from one another. Form and position of cerebellum. Division into two. No groove on the upper surface ; halves joined by upper worm. Horizontal fissure. A hollow below, which is called valley. Dissection. The cerebellum (fig. 59, b) is to be separated from the remains of the cerebrum by carrying the knife through the optic thalamus, so that the small brain, the corpora quadrigemina, the crura cerebri, the pons, and the medulla oblongata may remain united together. Any remaining pia mater is to be carefully removed from the median groove on the under surface; and the different bodies in that hollow are to be separated from one another. Lastly, the handle of the scalpel should be passed along a deep sulcus at the circumference, which is continued from the crus, between the upper and under surfaces. The cerebellum or small brain (fig. 68) is oval in shape, and flattened from above down. Its longest diameter, which is directed transversely, measures about four inches. This part of the encephalon is situate in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull, beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is incom- pletely divided into two hemispheres ; the division being marked by a wide median groove along the under surface, and by a notch at the posterior border into which the falx cerebelli projects. The narrower part uniting the two hemispheres is known as the worm (vermis). Upper surface. On the upper aspect the cerebellum is raised in the centre, and sloped towards the sides. There is not any median sulcus on this surface; and the hemispheres are united by a central constricted part—-the superior vermiform process. Separat- ing the upper from the under surface, at the circumference, is the horizontal fissure, which extends from the crus cerebelli in front to the median notch behind. The under surface of the cerebellum is convex on each side, where it is received into the lower fossaj of the occipital bone : and the hemispheres are separated by a median hollow—vallecula (fig. 68), which is widest hi front where it lodges the upper end of the medulla oblongata : the hinder end of the vallecula is continued into the notcli at the posterior border, and receives the falxLAMINAE AND LOBES. 229 cerebelli. At the bottom of the groove is an elongated mass named and the inferior vermiform process (c to e), wliich corresponds to the fowcr'worm. central part uniting the hemispheres above. The two vermiform processes constitute the general commissure of the halves of the cerebellum. Laminae and Sulci. The superficial part of the cerebellum is Surface composed of grey substance, and is marked by concentric laminae or toliate(1- folia, which have their free edges towards the surface, and run in a curved direction with the concavity turned forwards. The laminse Between are separated by sulci, which are lined by pia mater, and are of *re variable depth. Only a small number of the laminse appear on the Many folia surface, for many others are placed on the sides of the larger pro- are hidden, cesses, and are concealed within the deeper sulci. The laminse, especially the smaller ones, are frequently interrupted by the junction of neighbouring sulci. On the upper aspect many of the Arrange- laminse pass continuously from one hemisphere to the other, with worm."' only a slight bending forwards in the superior vermiform process ; but those of the under surface of the two hemispheres are connected by means of the special commissural bodies composing the inferior vermiform process. Tbe deepest sulci of the hemisphere divide the lamina into groups which are known as the lobes of the cerebellum. Lobes of the upper surface. On the upper surface theUpperioi.es hemisphere is divided into tw o lobes by a deep sulcus which arches nre outwards and forwards from the hinder end of the superior anterior, * Under surface of the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata being cut away in greater part. a.

Inferior medullary velum. Furrowed band. vermiform process. The anterior or quadrate lobe is the larger, and its laminaj pass without interruption through the vermiform process into the corresponding lobe of the opposite hemisphere. The posterior lobe is semilunar in shape, and is connected internally with the one of the opposite side l>y a single lamina (folium cacuminis), which is deeply placed at the bottom of the median notch. Belonging to this surface there is also at the front of the vermiform process a small part, comprising abont eight lamina), which overlaps the superior peduncles, and is known as the central lobe (fig. 65). The lobes OF the undeb sdrface of the hemisphere (fig. 68) are five in number. Beginning behind, there is first the posterior lobe (fc), of a semilunar form, like that of the upper surface, from which it is separated by the great horizontal fissure ; next comes the slender lobe (between k and i), composed of three or four parallel lamina; ; and then the larger biventral lobe, triangular in shape, and subdivided into two chief parts (i and h). The other two lobes, although smaller, are more distinct; one is the amygdaloid lobe (g), which lies in the inner side of the biventral lobe, and projects into the vallecula, touching the medulla oblongata ; and the other is a small conical part named the flocculus or subpeduncular lobe(f), which is placed in front of the biventral lobe and curves upwards round the lower border of the cms cerebelli, being attached to the general mass of the small brain only by a narrow white stalk. Parts of the inferior vermiform process. On the inferior vermiform process there are seen, from behind forwards—first a small eminence, comprising seven or eight narrow transverse lamina; which unite the posterior inferior and slender lobes of the two sides, and named tuber vahulas; next a larger, tongue-shaped projection, which serves as a commissure to the Li ventral lobes, and is called the pyramid ; and then a narrow elongated part—the uvula, at the- anterior extremity of which is the rounded prominence of the nodule. The uvula is connected to the amygdaloid lobe on each side by a grey strip named the furrowed, band, and the nodule to the flocculus by a thin white lamina—the inferior medullary relurn, but to see these parts the following dissection must be made. Dissection. The biventral and slender lobes are to be sliced off on the left side, so that the amygdaloid lobe may be everted from the valley (fig. 69). By this proceeding the stalk of the flocculus is exposed, and is seen to be continued into the thin and soft white layer of the inferior medullary velum (£>), which joins the nodule internally : beneath the velum a bit of paper may be inserted. The furrowed band (d) is also exposed on the side of the uvula. The inferior medullary velum is a thin white layer which forms a commissure to the flocculi, and is connected to the upper surface of the nodule in the middle. Its exposed part on each side, between the flocculus and the nodule, is semilunar in shape, and the anterior edge is free ; but behind, it is continued into the medullary centre of the cerebellum. The furrowed band (d) is a narrow ridge of grey matter, notched on the surface, which passes from the side of the uvula to the con-231 STRUCTURE OF LAMINJE. medullary centre stricted base of the amygdaloid lobe. It lies along the attached posterior margin of the inferior medullary velum. Structure op the Cerebellum. The interior of the cerebellum ^eMium consists of a large white mass—the medullary centre, from which a white onsets proceed to the laminae and to other parts of the encephalon. The medullary centre is surrounded, except in front, where the processes to other parts of the brain (peduncles of the cerebellum) issue from it, by a superficial layer of grey substance—the cortex of J£*P*y the cerebellum; and other small masses of grey matter are embedded in it. Structure of the lamince. The lamina} are seen in the section that Lracmi"f has been made of the under part of the left hemisphere to consist of externally, a grey external portion enveloping a white centre (fig. 65). The ^Jnhite grey matter is subdivided into two layers, the superficial of which is lighter and clear, while the deeper stratum is darker and of a rust-colour. The white part is derived from the medullar}7 centre, which sends off numerous processes to the lobes and the bodies composing the worm, and these, dividing like the branches of a tree, end in small offsets which enter the several laminae. Dissection. For the purpose of seeing the medullary centre, with D'sscetn its contained corpus dentatum, remove all the lamina? from the upper surface on the left side. This dissection may be accomplished by placing the scalpel in the horizontal fissure at the circumference, and carrying it inwards as far as the upper vermiform process, so as to detach the anterior and posterior lobes of the upper aspect. If the corpus dentatum does not at first appear, thin slices may be made anteriorly till it is reached. The medullary centre of the cerebellum forms a large oval mass in white each hemisphere, but is flattened and narrow in the middle between centru * View from behind of the under surface of the cerebellum, with some of the lobes removed to show the inferior medullary velum, a.

The lateral part contains the grey corpus clentatuin, and is continued in front into a large stalk- like process, which becomes divided into the three peduncles. From its surface, as already stated, offsets are furnished to the different lobes and laminae. The white, centre is composed mainly of the fibres of the peduncles radiating to the cortical grey mutter ; but there are in addition, as in the cerebrum, commissural fibres between tin- two hemispheres, which are most developed at the fore part of the superior vermiform process, and at the back close to the median notch, as well as a system of association-fibres uniting the laminae beneath the sulci. The corpus dentatum is situate in the inner part of the white mass of the hemisphere, and resembles the nucleus in the olivary body of the medulla oblongata. It measures about three-quarters of an inch from before back, and consists of a plicated capsule, which when cut across appears as a thin, wavy, greyish-yellow line : the bag is open at the fore and inner part, and encloses a core of white substance. Through its aperture issues a band of fibres to join the superior peduncle. Between the two dentate bodies, embedded in the central white matter, are some smaller portions of grey substance, the chief of which is an ova] mass on each side, nearly half an inch long, lying close to the middle line in the fore part of the superior vermiform process, and known as the roof-nucleus from its relation to the fourth ventricle. Peduncles of the cerebellum (fig. 67). These are three in number on each side, an upper (') passing to the cerebrum, a middle (2) to the pons, and an inferior (3) to the medulla oblongata. The superior peduncle (processus ad cerebrum; fig. 65, I) is directed forwards, and disappears beneath the corpora quadrigemina. It is rather flattened in shape, ami forms part of the roof of the fourth ventricle. The processes of the two sides are united by the valve of Vieussens (7c). Its fibres are derived mainly from the interior of tin- dentate body, but a few are added from the white centre of the hemisphere and the worm. Beneath the corpora quadrigemina the superior peduncle enters the tegmentum of the crus cerebri, and crosses the middle line decussating with the one of the opposite side. The fibres are then connected with the red nucleus (p. 202), and are continued with the longitudinal teg- mental fibres to the optic thalamus. The valve of Vieussens, or superior medullary velum; is a thin translucent white layer which enters into the roof of the upper part of the fourth ventricle (fig. 65, /,:). It is narrow in front, but widens behind, where it is continued into the medullary centre of the worm. On each side it joins the superior peduncle. Near the lamina quadrigemina the fourth nerve is attached to the valve ; and its upper surface is covered by four or five small transverse grey ridges, constituting the lingula (fig. 70). The middle peduncle (processus ad pontem ; fig. 70, nyp), commonly named the crus cerebelli, is the largest of the three processes. Its233 FOUETH VENTRICLE. fibres begin in the lateral part of the hemisphere, and are directed forwards to the pons, of which they form the transverse fibres (p. 199). The inferior peduncle (processus ad medullam ; fig. 70, ip) passes inferior downwards to the medulla oblongata, where it is known as the JJ^™^1,1 restiform body. Its fibres begin chiefly in the laminae of the upper surface of the hemisphere. It will be better seen when the fourth ventricle has been opened. Dissection. One other section (fig. 65) must be made to expose Dissection, the fourth ventricle. The cerebellum still resting on its under siu-face, let the knife be carried vertically through the centre of the vermiform processes ; and then the structure of the worm, as well as the boundaries of the fourth ventricle, may be observed on separating the halves of the cerebellum. Structure of the worm (fig. 65). The upper and lower vermiform Vermiform processes of the cerebellum are united in one central piece which nuTotnei- connects together the hemispheres. The structure of this con- P^3- necting piece is the same as that of the rest of the cerebellum, viz., a central white portion and investing lamina). Here the branch- ing appearance of a tree (arbor vitso) is best seen, in consequence of the lamina? being more divided, and the white central stalk being thinner and more ramified. The fourth ventricle (fossa rhomboidalis) is a space between Fourth the cerebellum and the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata ventncIc: and pons (fig. 65). It has the form of a lozenge, with the points placed upwards and downwards. The upper angle reaches as high as form and the upper border of the pons ; and the lower, nearly to the level of the extent> lower end of the olivary body. Its greatest breadth is opposite the breadth: lower edge of the pons; and a transverse line in this situation would div ide the hollow into two triangular portions—upper and lower. The lower half has been named calamus scriptorius from its resem- calamus blance to a writing pen. scriptorius. The lateral boundaries are more marked above than below. For Boundaries about half way down the cavity is limited on each side by the°nsi'e' superior peduncle of the cerebellum (I), which, projecting over it, fomis part of the roof; and along the lower half lies the eminence of the restiform body, with the clava of the funiculus gracilis (fig. 70, cl) at the inferior extremit}-. At the lower border of the lateral middle peduncle of the cerebellum a lateral process of the cavity reoess- extends outwards over the surface of the restiform body, being bounded below by a narrow white streak called the ligula (fig. 70, on right side). The roof of the space is formed above by the valve of Vieussens Roof, with the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and by the inferior medullary velum and nodule of the inferior vermiform process ; below by the reflection of the pia mater from that process to the medulla oblongata. Between the valve of Vieussens and the inferior medullary velum the ventricle forms an angular recess, the apex of which is directed towards the medullary centre of the worm.DISSECTION OP THE CEREBELLUM. 234 are a median grove, fasciculu: teres, auditory r trite, superior and Floor: The floor of the ventricle (fig. 70) is constituted by the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons, and is greyish in colour, objects in it Along the centre is a median groove, which ends below, near the point of the calamus, in a minute hole—the aperture of the canal of the cord. On each side of the groove is a spindle-shaped eleva- tion, the fasciculus s. eminentia teres (ft). This eminence reaches the whole length of the floor, and is pointed and well defined below, but less distinct above. Its widest part is opposite the centre of the ventricle. Crossing the floor on each side, at the lower border of the pons, p. * are some white lines—the audi- tory strim (a st), which vary much in their arrangement: they issue from the median groove, and pass outwards to the auditory nerve (p. 190). The fasciculus teres is limited externally by two small depres- sions—the superior and inferior fovea;, separated by the auditory stria?. The superior (fs) is the broader, and is connected to the lower one by a faint groove. The inferior fovea (fi) is well marked, and has the form of the letter V inverted. The triangular portion between the two branches is of a darker colour than the surface on each side, and is named the ala cinerea (fig. 71, ac): it corre- sponds to the nucleus of the vagus nerve. On the outer side of the fovea the surface is elevated over the principal nucleus of the auditory nerve, forming the auditory tubercle (at), which is crossed by the auditory stria). In the upper half of the floor of the ventricle there may be seen, on the inner side of the superior fovea, a rounded elevation of the fasciculus teres, produced by the nucleus of the sixth nerve, with the deep part of the facial arching round it (p. 189).

The fourth ventricle communicates above with the third ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and with the subarachnoid space through an ajjerture in the pia mater between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Below, it opens into the central canal of the cord. It is lined by ependyma, the epithelium of which is continued over the pia mater in the roof, and prolonged upwards and down- wards into the canals leading from the ventricle. Projecting into the lower half of the ventricle is a vascular fold on each side—choroid plexus, similar to the body of the same name in the lateral and third ventricles. It is attached to the inner sur- face of the pia mater which closes the ventricle between the and the cerebellum, and extends from the point of the scriptorius to the extremity of the lateral recess of the It receives branches from the inferior cerebellar artery. The floor of the fourth ventricle is covered by a layer of grey matter, which is continuous below with the grey commissure of the cord, and above with the grey substance of the aqueduct. Nuclei of cranial nerves (fig. 71). In the dorsal portion of the medulla oblongata and pons are situate the collections of nerve-cells from which many of the cranial nerves take their origin. Some of these ap- pear in the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, while others are placed a little below the surface. Beneath the calamus scriptorius, and in the portion of the floor of the cavity formed by the medulla oblongata, are the nuclei of the twelfth, tenth, ninth and eighth nerves. The hypoglossal nucleus (XII) extends through nearly the whole length of the medulla ob1 longata; its lower part is hidden, lying m front of the central canal below the level of the fourth ventricle, '■ but its upper half approaches the surface in the lower portion of the fasciculus teres. The nucleus of the vagus (X) corresponds to the ala cinerea, and is continued above into the glosso- pharyngeal nucleus (IX) which lies be- neath the inferior fovea.

While the dissection of the thorax is in progress, the student wall have to discontinue his work on the upper limb; but when that is finished, he must be ready to begin the part of the back that belongs to him. Position. The body lying on the back, the thorax is to be raised to a convenient height by a block; and the arm, being slightly rotated outw ards, is to be placed at a right angle with the trunk. Directions. Before the dissection is begun, attention should be given to the surface-marking ; and the prominences and depressions formed by the muscles, together with the parts of the bones that are to be recognised, should be noticed. The position of the chief blood-vessels is also to be ascertained. Surface-marking. On the front of the chest is seen the prominence of the mamma, large in the female, but small and rudimentary in the male, with the nipple projecting from it near the centre. In the male, the nipple is placed most frequently over the fourth inter- costal space, sometimes over the fifth rib, and occasionally at a still higher or lower level. Its position in the female varies greatly with the development of the mamma. Between the arm and the chest is the hollow of the axilla, in the outer part of which the large vessels and nerves of the limb are lodged. The extent of this hollow may be seen to vary much with the position of the limb to the trunk ; for in proportion as the arm is elevated, the folds bounding it in front and behind are carried upwards and rendered tense, and the depth of the space is diminished. In this part the skin is of a dark colour, and is furnished with hairs and large sweat-glands. If the arm is forcibly raised and moved in different directions, while the fingers of one hand are placed in the arm-pit, the head of the humerus may be recognised. ' On the outer side of the limb is the prominence of the shoulder; and immediately above it is an osseous arch, which is formed inPAETS ON FRONT OF THORAX. 243 front by the clavicle, behind and externally by the spine and the acromion process of the scapida. Continued downwards from about Interums- - cular de- pressions. the middle of the clavicle is a slight depression between the pectoral C1 and deltoid muscles, in which the coracoid process can be felt near that bone. A second groove, extending outwards from the sternal end of the clavicle, corresponds with the interval between the clavicular and the sternal origins of the great pectoral muscle. Along the front of the arm is the prominence of the biceps Arm: its muscle ; and on each side of that eminence is a groove, which and grooves, subsides inferiorly in a depression in front of the elbow-joint. The inner of the two grooves is the deeper, and indicates the position of the brachial vessels. If the elbow-joint be semiflexed, the prominences of the outer Promi- and inner condyles of the humerus will be rendered evident, espe- around the cially the inner. Below the outer condyle, and separated from it elbow-joint, by a slight interval, the head of the radius is placed ; it may be recognised by rotating that bone, the fingers at the same time being placed over it. At the back of the articulation is the prominence of the olecranon. Dissection. As the first step in the dissection, raise the skin from Dissection the side of the chest and the arm-pit, over the great pectoral muscle integument, and the hollow of the axilla, by means of the following incisions :— One is to be made along the middle of the sternum. A second, carried along the clavicle for the inner two-thirds of that bone, is to be continued down the front of the arm rather beyond the anterior fold of the arm-pit, and then to be turned across the inner surface of the arm as far as the hinder fold of the axilla. From the ensiform process a third cut is to be directed outwards over the side of the chest, as far back as to a level with the posterior fold of the arm-pit. The .flap of skin thus marked out is to be reflected outwards Reflect skin, beyond the axilla ; but it should be left attached to the body, in order that it may be used for the preservation of the part. The subcutaneous fatty layer of the thorax resembles the same Fascia: structure in other parts of the body ; but in this region it does not superficial; usually contain much fat. Beneath the subcutaneous layer is the stronger deep fascia, which and deep, closely invests the muscles, and is continuous with the fascia of the arm. It is tliin on the front of the chest, but becomes much thicker where it is stretched across the axilla. An incision through it, over thickest the ann-pit, will render evident its increased strength in this situa- overaxilla- tion, and the casing it gives to the muscles bounding the axilla ; and if the fore finger be introduced through the opening, some idea will be gained of its capability of confining an abscess in that hollow. Dissection. The cutaneous nerves of the side of the chest are to Dissection be next sought. At the spots where they are to be found they are "irS™' placed beneath the fat, which must be cut through to expose them ;the c,lest: and those over the clavicle lie also beneath the platysma muscle. Small vessels indicate the position of the nerves. Some of them (from the cervical plexus) cross the clavicle at from oervi- n 2 ca' l'loxnsDISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 244 and inter- costal nerves; nerve of Wrisberg.

And the rest (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be looked for along the side of the chest, about an inch behind the anterior fold of the axilla, there being one from eacli intercostal space except the first: as the last-mentioned nerves pierce the wall of the thorax, they divide into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branches of the highest two nerves are larger than the rest. They are to be followed across the arm-pit, and a junc- tion is to be found there with a branch (nerve of "Wrisberg) of the brachial plexus. Cutaneous nerves of the cervical plexus. These cross the clavicle and are distributed to the skin over the pectoral muscle. The most internal branch (sternal) lies near the inner end of the bone, and reaches but a short distance below it. Other branches (clavicular), two or more in number and larger, cross the middle of the clavicle,* and extend to near the lower border of the pectoralis major ; they join one or more of the anterior cutaneous nerves. The cutaneous nerves op the thorax are derived from the . trunks of the intercostal nerves between the ribs. Of these there are two sets :—One set, lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax, arise from those nerves about midway between the spine and the sternum. The other set, anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax, are the termi- nations of the same trunks at the anterior ends of the intercostal spaces. The anterior cutaneous nerves are slender filaments which pierce the pectoral muscle, and are directed outwards to supply the skin and the mammary gland. The offset of the second nerve joins a cutaneous branch from the cervical plexus. Small branches of the internal mammary vessels accompany these nerves. The lateral cutaneous nerves (fig. 72) issue with companion vessels between the digitations of the serratus magnus muscle, and divide into anterior and > posterior branches. There is not usually any lateral cutaneous nerve from the first intercostal trunk. The anterior offsets (°) bend over the pectoral muscle, and end in the integuments and the mammary gland-: they increase in size downwards, and the lowest give twigs to the digitations of the external oblique muscle. The cutaneous nerve of the second inter- costal trunk commonly wants the anterior offset. The posterior offsets (3) end in the integuments over the latis- simus dorsi muscle and the back of the scapula, and decrease in size from above down. The branch of the second intercostal nerve (7) is larger than the rest, and is named intercosto-humeral. Perforating the fascia of the axilla, it is distributed to the skin of the arm (p. 272). As it crosses the axilla it is divided into two or more pieces, and is con- nected to the nerve of Wrisberg (6) by a filament of variable size.^ The branch of the third intercostal nerve gives filaments likewise to the arm-pit and the inner side of the arm.245 MAMMARY GLAND. The Mamma is the gland for the secretion of the milk, and is of tllu situate on the lateral part of the front of the chest.* Eesting on the great pectoral muscle, it is nearly hemispherical Forman<1 in form, but most prominent at the inner and lower aspects. Its pos lon' dimensions and weight vary greatly. In a In-east not enlarged by dimensions lactation, the width is commonly about four inches. Longitudinally it extends froin the third to the sixth or seventh rib, and transversely from the, side of the sternum to the axilla. Its thickness is about one inch and a half. The weight of the mamma ranges from six to and weight, eight ounces. Nearly in the centre of the gland (rather to the inner side) rises Position and the conical or cylindrical projection of the nipple or mamilla. This hippie :the prominence is about half an inch or rather more in length, is slightly turned outwards, and presents in the centre a shallow depression, where it is rather redder. Around the nipple is a coloured ring— the areola the areola, about an inch in width, the tint of which is influenced colour is by the complexion of the body, and becomes, darker duringaltered- pregnancy and lactation. The skin of the nipple and areola is ^°dgas provided with numerous papillaj and glands ; and on the surface are ° some small tubercles marldng the position of the latter. In the male the mammary gland resembles that of the female in Jjjjf"^^ general form, though it is much less developed ; and it possesses a small nipple, which is surrounded by an areola provided with hairs. The glandular or secretory structure is imperfect. Structure. The mamma is a compound racemose gland, and con- Structure sists of small vesicles, which are united to form lobules and lobes. Connected with each lobe is an excretory or lactiferous duct. A layer of areolar tissue, containing masses of fat, surrounds the investing gland, and penetrates into the interior, subdividing it into lobes; but between the lobules of the gland, and in the nipple and areola, there is not any fatty substance. Some fibrous septa fix the gland and fibrous to the skin, and support it ; these are the ligamenta suspensoria of ' Astley Cooper. Vesicles. The little vesicles or alveoli at the ends of the most Vesicles, minute ducts are rounded in shape, and when filled with milk or mercury are just visible to the naked eye. Each is surrounded externally by a close vascular network. Lobules anal lobes. A collection of the vesicles around their ducts Lobules and forms a lobule, and by the union of the lobules the lobes are pro- loties' duced. Of these there are about twenty altogether, and each is provided with a distinct duct. The ducts issuing from the several lobes (about twenty) are named Lactiferous from their office galactophorous ; they converge to the areola, where ducts' they swell into oblong dilatations or reservoir's (sinuses) of one-sixth to one-third of an inch in width. Onwards from that spot the ducts become narrower; and, surrounded by areolar tissue and vessels, are continued through the nipple, nearly parallel to one another, to * If the student has a male body, he may disregard the description of the mamma ; and if the body is a female, he may set aside the breast for a more convenient examination of its structure.DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 246 open on end ui nipple.

The substance of the nipple is composed in great part of a network of interlacing bundles of plain muscular tissue, through which the lactiferous ducts pass to the surface. Some of the bundles extend from base to apex of the nipple ; and surrounding the base is a set of circular fibres, with which radiating bundles decussate. Arteries of the gland, and veins. Blood-vessels.—The arteries are supplied by the axillary, internal mammary, and intercostal, and enter both surfaces of the gland. The veins end prin- cipally in the axillary and internal mammary trunks; but others enter the intercostal veins. Nerves. The nerves are supplied from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the thorax, viz., from the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerves. Lymphatics. The lymphatics of the inner side open into the sternal glands ; those of the outer side pass to the axillary glands. Dissection of pectoral muscle. Remove fat of axilla, follow vessels. Clean back of space. Trace nerves of plexus, and on inner wall. Dissection (fig. 72). With the limb in the same position to the trunk, the student is first to remove the fascia and the fat from the surface of the great pectoral muscle. In cleaning the muscle the scalpel should be carried in the direction of the fibres, viz., from the arm to the thorax ; and the dissection may be begun at the lower border on the right side, but at the upper border on the left side. The fascia and the fat are to be taken from the axilla, without injury to the numerous vessels, nerves, and glands in the space. The dissection will be best executed by cleaning first the large axillary vessels at the outer part, where these are about to enter the arm ; and then following their branches which are directed to the chest, viz., the long thoracic under cover of the anterior boundary, and the subscapular along the posterior boundary. With the latter vessels the middle and lower subscapular nerves are to be found, and turning backwards near the arm the circumflex artery and nerve. Some arterial twigs entering the axillary glands should also be traced out. In taking away the fascia and fat from the muscles at the back of the space, the small internal cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve (fig. 72, G) should be looked for near the'great vessels. The nerves of the brachial plexus are then to be defined. The smallest of these, which possibly may be destroyed, is the nerve of Wrisberg : it lies close to the hinder edge of the axillary vein, and joins with the intercosto-humeral nerve. When cleaning the serratus muscle on the ribs the student is to seek on its surface the posterior thoracic nerve ; and to trace the posterior offsets of the intercostal nerves crossing the axilla. THE AXILLA. Situation and form of the arm-pit. The axilla is the hollow between the arm and the chest (fig. 72). It is somewhat pyramidal in form, and its apex is directed upwards to the root of the neck. The space is larger near the thorax than at the arm, and its boundaries are as follows :— Boundaries, Boundaries. In front and behind, the space is limited by the247 BOUNDARIES OF AXILLA. muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior wall are the two pectoral muscles, but these take unequal shares in its construction, in consecpience of the difference in their size :— thus the pectoralis major (a) extends over the whole front of the ^ front, space, reaching from the clavicle to the edge of the anterior fold; while the pectoralis minor (b) corresponds only to about the middle third of the wall. In the posterior boundary, from above down- and behind; wards, lie the subscapularis (f), the latissimus dorsi muscle (d), and Fig. 72.* the teres major (e): the free margin of this boundary, which is ' formed by the latissimus dorsi and teres major, is thicker and more prominent, especially near^he arm, than the anterior.

On the outer side the space outer sicles >' lias but small dimensions, and is limited by the humerus and the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles (g and h).

In the axilla are contained the axillary vessels and the brachial plexus, with their branches ; some branches of the intercostal nerves ; together with lymphatic glands, and a large quantity of loose areolar tissue and fat. Position of the trunks of vessels and nerves. The large axillary artery («) and vein (b) cross the outer portion of the space in passing from the neck to the upper limb. The part of each vessel now seen lies close to the humerus, reaching beyond the line of the anterior fold of the arm-pit, and is covered only by the common superficial coverings, viz., the skin, the fatty layer or superficial fascia, and the deep fascia. Behind the vessels are the subscapulars (f) and the tendons of the latissimus and teres muscles (d and e). To their outer side is the coraco-brachialis muscle (g). On looking into the space from below, the axillary vein (b) lies on the thoracic side of the artery. After the vein has been drawn aside, the artery will be seen to lie amongst the large nerves of the upper limb, having the median trunk (') to the outer side, and the ulnar (3) and the small nerve of Wrisberg (5) to the inner side; the internal cutaneous (2) gene- rally superficial to, and the musculo-spiral (4) and circumflex nerves beneath it, This part of the artery gives branches to the side of the chest and the shoulder. The vein receives some branches in this spot. Posit ion of the branches of vessels and nerves. The several branches of the vessels and nerves have the undermentioned position with respect to the boundaries :— Close to the anterior fold, and concealed by it, the long thoracic artery runs to the side of the chest; and taking the same direction, though nearer the middle of the hollow, are the small external mammary artery and vein. Extending along the posterior wall, within its free margin and in contact with the edge of the subscapulars muscle, are the sub- scapular vessels and nerves (d) ; and near the humeral end of the subscapulars the posterior circumflex vessels (e) and the circumflex nerve bend backwards beneath the large trunks. On the inner boundary, at the upper part, are a few small branches of the superior thoracic artery, which ramify on the serratus muscle ; but these are commonly so unimportant, that this part of the axillary space may be considered free from vessels with respect to any surgical operation. Lying on the surface of the serratus magnus, is the nerve to that muscle ; and perforating the inner boundary of the space, are the lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax,—the highest of which is directed across the axilla to the arm, and receives the name intercosto-humeral ('). The lymphatic glands of the axilla are arranged in three sets : one is placed along the inner side of the great blood-vessels; another249 PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE. occupies the hinder part of the space, lying near the subscapular o™J}£; vessels; and the third accompanies the long thoracic artery, beneath ' the margin of the pectoralis major. Commonly there are in all ten or twelve ; but in number and size they vary much. Small twigs from the branches of the axillary vessels are furnished to them. The glands by the side of the blood-vessels receive the lymphatics and vessels of the arm; those along the hinder boundary are joined by the lymphatics of the side of the chest and of the back; and those beneath the pectoral muscle by the lymphatics of the front of the chest, as well as by some from the mamma. The efferent vessels unite to form a trunk, which opens into the lymphatic duct of the neck of the same side; or some may enter separately the subclavian vein. The pectoralis major (a) is triangular in shape, with the base Great pec- at the sternum, and the apex at the arm. It arises from the inner j£ig|.ie> half of the front of the clavicle, from the anterior surface of the sternum and the cartilages of the upper six ribs, and below from and sterno- the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. ^jjj?} From this wide origin the fibres take different directions—those from the clavicle being inclined obliquely downwards, wdiile the lower ones ascend behind the middle portion of the muscle ; and all er«on end in a tendon, which is inserted into the pectoral ridge on the into hunie- outer side of the bicipital groove of the humerus. rus- This muscle bounds the axilla in front, and its lower border forms Relations, the anterior fold of the hollow. Covering it are the integuments, with the mamma and the thin deep fascia, as well as the platysma close to the clavicle. The upper border is adjacent to the deltoid muscle, the cephalic vein and a-small artery lying between the two. Between the clavicular and sternal origins is a narrow interval, Interval which corresponds to a depression on the surface. The parts two^arts!'16 beneath the pectoralis major will be seen subsequently. Action. If the humerus is hanging, the muscle will move for- Use: flexes, wards the limb until the elbow reaches the front of the trunk, and lotates will rotate it in. When the limb is raised, the pectoralis depresses and adducts it; and adducts and acting with other muscles inserted into the humerus, it may dis- ann; locate the head of that bone when the lower end is raised and fixed, as in a fall on the elbow. Supposing both limbs fixed, as in climbing, the trunk will be raises ribs, raised by both muscles ; and the lower fibres can elevate the ribs in laborious breathing. Dissection (fig. 73).

A branch of nerve (anterior thoracic), and the acromio-thoracic vessels, which perforate the sheath around the axillary trunks, are to be followed to the pectoral muscle. The remaining part of the pectoralis major may be cut about its centre, and the pieces thrown inwards and outwards. Any fat coming into view is to be removed ; and the tendon of the pectoralis is to be followed to the humerus. Insertion of the pectoralis. The tendon of the pectoralis consists of two layers, anterior and posterior, at its attachment to the bone ;— the anterior receives the clavicular and upper sternal fibres, and joins the tendon of the deltoid muscle ; and the posterior gives attachment to the lower ascending fibres. The tendon is from two inches to two inches and a half wide, and sends upwards one ex- pansion over the bicipital groove to the capside of the shoulder- joint, and another downwards to the fascia of the arm. Parts covered by the pectoralis. The great pectoral muscle covers the pectoralis minor, and forms alone, above and below that muscle, the anterior boundary of the axilla. Between the pectoralis minor and the clavicle it conceals the subclavius muscle, the sheath con- taining the axillary vessels, and the branches perforating that sheath. Below the pectoralis minor it lies on the side of the chest, on the axillary vessels and nerves, and on the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles near the humerus. The pectoralis minor (fig. 73, b) is also triangular in shape, and extends from the thorax to the shoulder. It arises from the third, fourth and fifth ribs, immediately external to their cartilages, by tendinous slips which are blended with the aponeuroses covering the intercostal muscles. The fibres converge to their insertion into the anterior half of the coracoid process of the scapula, at its upper and inner part. This muscle assists the pectoralis major in forming the anterior wall of the axilla, and near its insertion it lies over the large vessels and the accompanying nerves. The upper border is separated from the clavicle by a triangular interval. The lower border projects beyond the pectoralis major close to the chest; and along it the long thoracic vessels lie. The tendon of insertion is united with the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps. Action. It draws the scapula forwards and downwards ; and in laborious breathing it becomes an inspiratory muscle, taking its fixed point at the shoulder. Dissection. Supposing the clavicle raised by pressing backwards the arm, as before directed, the tube of fascia around the vessels will be demonstrated by making a transverse cut below the costo- coracoid membrane (fig. 73), so that the handle of the scalpel can be passed beneath it. Then, by dividing the membrane itself near the clavicle and raising the lower border of the subclavhis, this muscle will be seen to be encased by fascia, which is attached to the bone both before and behind it. The costo-coracoid membrane or ligament (fig. 73) is a firm251 AXILLARY ARTERY. band which receives this name from its attachment on the one cold mem- Bide to the rib, and on the other to the coracoid process of the scapula. Between these points it is inserted into the clavicle, ^°^us enclosing the snbclavius muscle, and is joined by the piece of fascia that encases the small pectoral muscle. The part of the and joins membrane behind the subclavius is blended with the front of the vessels, axillary sheath. The sheath of the axillary vessels and nerves (e) is a funnel- Axillary shaped tube, prolonged from the fascia covering the scaleni muscles in the lower part of the neck.

After the costo-coracoid membrane has been examined, Clean the the remains of it are to be taken away; and the subclavius mirscle, %esse and the axillary vessels and nerves with their branches, are to be carefully cleaned. The subclavius (fig. 73, d) is a small elongated muscle, placed ^gjgVius below the clavicle. It arises by a tendon from the first rib and its cartilage at their junction, in front of the costo-clavicular ligament. The fibres pass outwards and somewhat upwards, and are inserted into a trroove on the under surface of the clavicle, which reaches between Is attached _ ' ...to clavicle the two rough impressions for the costo- and coraco-clavicular and first rib. ligaments.

The part of the vessel to which this name is applied is contained in the axilla, and extends from the outer border extent, of the first rib to the lower edge of the teres major muscle (h). In the axillary space its position will be marked by a line from course, the centre of the clavicle to the inner edge of the coraco-brachialis. Its direction will vary with the position of the limb to the trunk ; for when the arm lies by the side of the body the vessel is arched, its convexity being upwards ; but when the limb is raised to the level of the shoulder, it is somewhat curved in the opposite The depth direction. In the upper part of the axilla the vessel is deeply vanes" placed, but it becomes superficial as it approaches the arm. Its relations with the surrounding objects are numerous; and Relations :— the description of these will be methodised by dividing the artery into three parts—one above, one beneath, and one below the small pectoral muscle. Above the small pectoral muscle, the artery is contained in the Above small axillary sheath of membrane (e), and is concealed by the clavi- peotoral: cular portion of the great pectoral muscle. Behind it are the with intercostal muscles of the first space and the first digitation of the nmsclea serratus magnus.' To the thoracic side is placed the axillary vein (g).

Here the artery lies in the midst of the large trunks of nerves and nerves, into which the brachial-plexus has been resolved:—On the outer side is the median nerve, with the musculo-cutaneous for a short distance ; and on the inner side are the ulnar, and the nerve of "Wrisberg. Superficial to the vessel is the internal cutaneous ; and behind are the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves, the latter extending only as far as the border of the subscapular muscle. The branches of the axillary artery are furnished to the Avail of Branches to the thorax and, the shoulder. The thoracic branches are four in11 eth?rax number ; two (superior and acromio-thoracic) arise from the artery above the pectoralis minor ; one (alar thoracic) beneath the muscle ; and one (long thoracic) at the lower border. Three branches are supplied to the shoulder, viz., subscapular and two circumflex ; they and the arise close together, at the border of the subscapularis muscle. The last offsets are the external, mammary and some muscular twigs. The superior thoracic branch is the highest and smallest offset, and Upper, arises opposite the first intercostal space ; it ramifies on the side oftlloracic- the chest, anastomosing with the intercostal arteries. The acromio-thoracic branch (fig. 73, a) is a short trunk on the Acromio- front of the artery, which apvjears at the upper border of the pecto- *10racic: ralis minor, and opposite the interval between the large pectoral and deltoid muscles. Its principal offsets are directed inwards and outwards:— a. The inner or thoracic set supply the pectoral muscles, and give offsets are a few offsets to the side of the chest, which anastomose with the in - ma1, intercostal and other thoracic arteries. 6.

The long thoracic branch (fig. 73, 6) is directed along the border of Longtho- the pectoralis minor to about the fifth intercostal space; it supplies ra°l°' the pectoral and serratus muscles, and anastomoses, like the other branches, with the intercostal and thoracic arteries. In the female it gives branches to the mammary gland. An external mammary artery is frequently met with, especially in External the female; its position is near the middle of the axilla with a mamniaTy- companion vein. It supplies the glands, and ends in the wall of the thorax below the preceding. I254 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. Subscapular lias n dorsal branch, which gives infra- scapular. Anterior and posterior circumflex. Muscular. Axillary vein: extent and relations; branches. Dissection of brachial plexus. Nerves entering brachial plexus. Its situation and rela- tions. The nerves form three cords around the artery, The subscapular branch (fig. 73, c) courses with a nerve of the same name along the. subscapular^, as far-as the lower angle of the scapula, where it ends in branches for the serratus magnus, and the latissimus dorsi and teres muscles : it gives many offsets to the glands of the space. Near its origin the artery sends backwards a considerable dorsal branch round the edge of the subscapular muscle : this gives an infrascapular offset to the ventral aspect of the scapula, and then turns to the dorsum of that bone, where it will be afterwards dis- sected (p. 269). The subscapular artery is frequently combined at its origin with other branches of the axillary, or with branches of the brachial artery. The circumflex branches wind round the humerus below the sub- scapular muscle. The anterior is small, and passes outwards beneath the coraco-brachialis and biceps. The -posterior is much larger, and disappears with the companion nerve between the subscapularis and teres major muscles. They will be followed in the dissection of the shoulder (p. 264). Small muscular offsets enter the coraco-brachialis muscle. The axillary vein (</) continues upwards the basilic vein of the arm, and has the same extent as the axillary artery. It lies to the thoracic side of its artery, and receives corresponding thoracic and shovdder brandies. Opposite the subscapular muscle it is joined externally by a large vein, which is formed by the union of the venae comites of the brachial artery ; and near the clavicle the cephalic vein opens into it. Dissection. To follow out the branches of the brachial plexus, cut through the pectoralis minor near its insertion into the coracoid process, and turn it towards the chest, but without injuring the thoracic nerves. The axillary vessels are next to be divided below the second rib,* and to be drawn down with hooks; and their thoracic branches may be removed at the same time. A dense fascia is to be cleared away from the large nerves of the plexus. The brachial plexus (fig. 74) results from the interlacement of the anterior branches of the lower four cervical nerves and the larger part of the first dorsal; and a slip is added to it above from the lowest nerve in the cervical plexus. It is placed successively in the neck and the axilla, and ends opposite the coracoid process in the nerves of the limb. The part of the plexus above the clavicle is described in the dissection of the head and neck (p. 71). The part below the clavicle has the same relations to surrounding muscles as the axillary artery; and in it the nerve-trunks are disposed as follows :— As the plexus enters the axilla it consists of three cords, inner, outer, and posterior, which lie together in a bundle on the outer side of the artery. Beneath the pectoralis minor the three cords embrace * The student must be careful not to cut the vessels higher than the spot mentioned, otherwise he will injure the dissection of the neck.BKACHIAL PLEXUS. the vessel being placed as their names indicate—the first inside, the second outside and the third behind the artery.

Dissection of the ser- ratus. edge of the small pectoral muscle, the cords divide to form the large nerves of the limb.. The branches of the plexus below the clavicle arise from the several cords in the following way :— The outer cord furnishes one anterior thoracic branch (eat), the musculocutaneous (mc), and the outer head of the median nerve (m). The inner cord gives origin to a second anterior thoracic nerve (iat), the internal cutaneous (ic), the nerve of Wrisberg (w), the inner head of the median (m), and the ulnar nerve (u). The posterior cord furnishes the subscapular branches (si, s2, and s3), and ends in the circumflex (c) and musculo-spiral (ms) trunks. Only the thoracic and subscapular nerves are exposed to their termination at present; the remaining nerves will be seen in the subsequent dissections. The anterior thoracic branches (fig. 73, 1 and 2), two in number, are named outer and inner, like the cords from which they come. The outer nerve crosses over the axillary artery, to the under surface of the great pectoral muscle in which it ends. On the inner side of the vessel it communicates with the following branch. The inner nerve comes forwards between the artery and vein, and after receiving the offset from the outer, ends in many branches to the under surface of the pectoralis minor. Some twigs enter the great pectoral muscle, after passing either through the pectoralis minor or above its border. The subscapular nerves are three in number, and supply the muscles bounding the axilla behind :■— The upper nerve is the smallest, and enters the upper part of the subscapularis muscle. The middle or long subscapular nerve accompanies the subscapular artery along the posterior wall of the axilla, and supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle. The lower subscapular nerve gives a branch to the lower part of the subscapularis muscle, and ends in the teres major. Another branch of the plexus, the posterior thoracic nerve or nerve to the serratus lies on the inner side of the axilla (fig. 73, 4). It arises above the clavicle from the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves (p. 73 ; fig. 74, pt), and descends behind the axillary vessels to reach the outer surface of the serratus magnus muscle. The latissimus dorsi muscle (g) may be examined as far as it enters into the posterior wall of the axilla. Arising from the spinal column and the back of the trunk, and crossing the lower angle of the scapula, the muscle ascends to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove, by a tendon one inch and a half in width, in front of the teres ; at the lower border aponeurotic fibres connect the two, but a bursa intervenes between them near the insertion. Dissection. To lay bare the serratus magnus, the arm is to be drawn from the trunk, so as to separate the scapula from the thorax. The nerves of the brachial plexus may be cut through opposite the third rib ; and the fat and connective tissue should be cleaned from the muscular fibres.257 SEEEATUS MAGNUS MUSCLE. The serratus Magnus mdsule (fig. 75) extends from the side of Serratus the chest to-the base of the scapula. It arises from the upper m"B"us • eight or nine ribs by as many slips or digitations, and passes back- origin ; wards, diminishing in breadth, to be inserted into the whole length insertion, of the base of the scapula on the ventral aspect. From a difference in the arrangement of the slips, the muscle is divided into three parts :— The upper pari is formed by the first digitation, which is thicker Three parts than the others, and springs from the first and second ribs, as well muscle, as from a tendinous arch between them : it is in- Kg. 75.* serted into an impression in front of the upper angle of the scapula. The middle part is thin, and comprises two digitations, which spread out from the second and third ribs to the verte- bral border of the scapula. The lower part is the strongest, and consists of the remaining five or six slips, which converge from their ribs (fourth to eighth or ninth) to a special sur- face on the ventral aspect of the lower angle of the scapula. The serratus is in great \ ^ part concealed by the pec- toral muscles, the axillary vessels and nerves, and the scapula with the subscapularis and latissimus dorsi muscles. Its deep surface rests against the ribs and the intercostal muscles. The lower slips interdigitate with like processes of the external oblique muscle. Action. The whole muscle acting, the scapula is carried forwards. Use. But the lower and stronger fibres can move forwards the lower angle, so as to rotate the bone, and turn the glenoid cavity upwards. The lowest slips may raise the ribs in forced inspiration. Dissection. The intercostal muscles will be brought into view by Dissection detaching the processes of the serratus from the ribs for a couple of mter" inches, and by taking away the loose tissue on the surface. At the muscles, front of the chest a thin aponeurosis is continued forwards from each external intercostal to the sternum; this is to be left in the third space. Some of the lateral cutaneous nerves should be preserved. The intercostal muscles form two layers in each space, but intercostal neither occupies the whole length of the interval.

Dissection of internal mammary vessels. ning very obliquely downwards and forwards, while those of the internal pass, although less obliquely, downwards and backwards. The external muscle consists of fleshy and tendinous fibres, and is attached to the margins of the ribs bounding the intercostal space. It extends from the tubercle of the upper rib behind to the end of the bone in front, except in the last two spaces, where the muscle is continued forwards between the cartilages. A thin membrane (anterior intercostal aponeurosis') takes the place of the muscle between the rib-cartilages. Dissection. The internal intercostal muscle will be seen by cutting through and removing the external layer and the fascia in one of the widest spaces, say the second. Far back between the two muscles, and close to the rib above, the intercostal nerve and vessels will be found. A branch of the nerve to the surface (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be followed through the external muscle ; and the trunk of the nerve is to be traced forwards in one or more spaces to the sternum and the sur- face of the chest. The hinder part of the muscles will be seen in the dissection of the back and thorax. The internal intercostal muscle is attached to the inner surface of the ribs bounding the space. It begins near the angles of the ribs behind, the upper muscles approaching more closely to the spine than the lower ones, and reaches to the extremity of the intercostal space in front. The fibres of the lowest two muscles are continuous anteriorly with those of the internal oblique of the abdomen. One surface is in contact with the external muscle, and the intercostal vessels and nerve ; and the other is lined by the pleura. Action. By the action of the intercostal muscles the ribs are moved in respiration. The external intercostals elevate the ribs and evert the lower edges, so as to enlarge the. thorax in the antero-posterior and transverse directions : they come into play during inspiration. The internal intercostals act in a different way at the side and fore part of the chest. Between the osseous parts of the ribs they depress and turn in those bones, diminishing the size of the thorax ; and they are brought into use in expiration. Between the rib-cartilages they raise the ribs, and are muscles of inspiration, like the outer layer. Dissection. To bring into view the triangularis sterni muscle and the internal mammary vessels, the cartilages of the true ribs, except the first and seventh, are to be taken away with the intervening muscles on the right side ;* but the two ribs mentioned are to be left untouched for the benefit of the dissectors of the abdomen and of the head and neck. Small arteries to each intercostal space and the surface of the thorax, and the intercostal nerves are to be preserved. * On the left side the vessels and the muscle may have been destroyed by the injection of the body.259 INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. and rela- tions. The surface of the triangularis sterni will be apparent when the loose tissue and fat are removed. The triangularis sterni (fig. 76) is a thin muscle beneath the J™1^'1'11'13 costal cartilages. It arises internally from the side of the ensiform process, from°the back of the sternum as high as the third costal car- origin; tilage, and usually from the inner ends of the cartilages of the lower two°o'r three true ribs. Its fibres are directed outwards, the upper ones also ascending considerably, and are inserted by fleshy slips into insertion; the true ribs except the first and last, at Kg- ?6-* the junction of the bone and cartilage : some of the fibres fre- quently end in an aponeurosis in the in- tercostal spaces. In front of the muscle are the rib- cartilages and the in- ternal intercostals, with the internal mammary vessels and intercostal nerves. Be- hind, it lies on the pleura. Its lower part is continuous with the transversalis muscle of the abdomen (fig. 76, b). The size of this muscle varies greatly, and one or more of the upper slips are frequently wanting. Action. The triangularis sterni assists in depressing the anterior Use- ends of the ribs, and acts with the interosseous internal intercostals in expiration. The INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY is a branch of the Subclavian Internal (p. 70), and enters the thorax beneath the cartilage of the first rib. artery*17 It is continued through the thorax, lying behind the costal cartilages and about half an inch from the sternum, as far as the sixth inter- costal space ; here it gives externally a large muscular branch (mus- courses culo-phrenic), and then passing beneath the seventh cartilage, enters y""°afto the sheath of the rectus muscle in the wall of the abdomen. In the abdomen, chest the artery lies on the pleura and the triangularis sterni, and is crossed by the intercostal nerves. It is accompanied by two veins, and by the chain of sternal lymphatic glands. Its thoracic branches Branches: are numerous but small:— a. A long, slender branch (comes nervi phrenici) arises as the superior artery enters the chest, and descends to the diaphragm with the phremc' phrenic nerve : this branch is seen in the dissection of the thorax. b.

At this stage the thorax and back are dissected. twigs pass backwards to be distributed to tbe remains of the thymus gland and the pericardium. c. Two anterior intercostal branches run outwards in each space, lying along the borders of the costal cartilages, and terminate by anastomosing with the aortic intercostal arteries. d. Perforating branches, one or two opposite each space, pierce the internal intercostal and large pectoral muscles, and are distributed on the surface of the thorax with the anterior cutaneous nerves : the lower branches supply the mamma in the female. e. The musculo-phrenic branch courses outwards beneath the cartilages of the seventh and eighth ribs, and enters the diaphragm : it supplies anterior branches to the lower intercostal spaces. Its termination will appear in the dissection of the abdomen. Two veins accompany the artery ; these join into one trunk, which opens into the innominate vein. The intercostal nerves, seen now in the anterior half of their extent, are the anterior primary branches of the dorsal nerves, and supply the wall of the thorax. Placed at first between the layers of the intercostal muscles, each gives off the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thorax about midway between the spine and the sternum. ■ Much diminished in size by the emission of this offset, the trunk is continued onwards, at first in, and afterwards beneath the internal intercostal muscle, as far as the side of the sternum, where it ends as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the thorax. Branches supply the intercostal muscles, and the triangularis sterni. The aortic intercostal arteries lie with the nerves between the strata of intercostal muscles, and close to the upper rib bounding the space. Near the angle of the rib the artery gives off a branch which is continued forwards along the edge of the lower rib; and both anastomose in front with the intercostal offsets of the internal mammary artery. A small cutaneous offset is distributed with the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thorax; and other branches are furnished to the thoracic wall. Directions. The dissector of the upper limb now waits the ap- pointed time for the examination of the thorax. But as soon as the body is turned he is to take his share in the dissection of the back, and to proceed with the paragraphs marked for him in Chapter V.' After the back is finished, the limb is to be detached from the trunk by sawing the clavicle about the middle, and cutting through the soft parts connected with the scapula.SCArULAR MUSCLES. 261 Section II. SCAPULAR MUSCLES, VESSELS, NERVES, AND LIGAMENTS. Dissection of muscles. Muscles attached to upper margin of the scapula, Position. After the limb has been separated from the trunk it is Position, to be placed with the subscapularis uppermost. Dissection. The, different muscles that have been traced to the scapida in the dissection of the front of the chest and of the back are now to be followed to their insertion into the bone. A small part of each, about an inch in length, should be left for the purpose of showing the attachment. Between the larger rhomboid muscle and the serratus magnus, at the base of the scapula, run the posterior scapular artery and vein, the ramifications of which are to be traced. To the borders and the angles of the scapida the following muscles are connected :— From the upper mar- gin of the scapida arises one muscle, the omo- hyoid (fig. 77, e). About half an inch wide at its origin, the muscle is attached to the edge of the lione behind the notch, and sometimes to the ligament which bridges over the notch. Along the axillary margin arise the long head of the triceps (fig. 83, a), and' the teres minor (h) and major (g) muscles ; these attach- ments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The vertebral border of the bone has four muscles inserted into it. and lo base > Between the superior augle and the spine is the levator anguli scapula; (fig. 78, h) ; 'opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor (j) is attached ; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major (k) is inserted : the upper fibres of the last * View of the subscapularis and the surrounding muscles.

In front of these muscles, and inserted into the base of the scapula along its whole length, is the serratus magnus muscle (fig. 77, d), the upper and lower parts of which are much thickened, and occupy special surfaces on the ventral aspect of the corresponding angles of the bone. The insertion of the small pectoral muscle into the anterior half of the coracoid process at its upper and inner part is also seen (%• 77, f). Dissection. By the separation of the serratus from the sub- scapularis there comes into view a thin fascia, which belongs to the latter muscle, and is fixed to the bone round its margins; after it has been observed, it may be taken away. The subscapularis muscle is to be followed forwards to its in- sertion into the humerus ; and the axillary vessels and nerves, with their offsets to the muscles, should be well cleaned. The subscapularis muscle (fig. 77, a) lies beneath the scapula, and is for the most part concealed by that bone when the limb is in its natural position. It arises from the concave ventral surface of the scapula, except near the upper and lower angles, and over the neck; and a thick portion of the muscle is attached in the groove along the axillary margin of the bone: many of the fleshy fibres spring from-tendinous septa which are fixed to the ridges on the surface of the scapula. The muscle is inserted by a tendon into the , impression on the small tuberosity of the humerus, and by fleshy fibres into the bone for nearly an inch below this mark. By one surface the muscle bounds the axilla, and is in contact with the axillary vessels and nerves, and the serratus magnus. By' the other, it rests against the scapula and the shbulder-joint; and between its tendon and the root of the coracoid process is a bursa, which generally communicates with the synovial cavity of that joint. The lower border projects beyond the scapula, and is con- tiguous to the teres major, the latissimus dorsi, and the long head of the triceps ; along this border the subscapular artery runs, the dorsal branch of which, with the posterior circumflex artery and the circumflex nerve, turn backwards below it. Action. It rotates in the hanging limb ; and when the humerus is raised it depresses that bone. Dissection. The subscapidaris is to be separated from the scapula, but a thin layer of fibres, in which the vessels lie, is to be left on the bone. As the muscle is raised, its tendinous processes of origin, the connection between its tendon and the capsule of the shoulder-1 joint, - and the bursa are to be observed. A small arterial anasto- mosis on the ventral surface of the bone is to be dissected out of the fleshy fibres. The infrascapular artery is an offset of the dorsal branch of the subscapular vessel (p. 254), and ramifies on the ventral surface of the scapula. Passing beneath the subscapular muscle, it forms an anastomosis with small twigs of the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries.263 DELTOID MUSCLE. Position. The examination of the muscles on the opposite sur- Position of face of the scapula may he next undertaken. For this purpose the Umb' limb is to be turned over; and a block, which is deep enough to make the shoulder prominent, is to be placed between the scapula and the arm. Dissection. The skin is to be removed from the prominence of Dissection the shoulder, down to the middle of the outer side of the arm. After Moulder, its removal some small cutaneous nerves are to be found in the fat : the upper of these descend over the acromion ; and a larger branch comes' to the surface about half-way down the posterior border of the deltoid muscle. Superficial nerves. Branches of nerves, supraacromial, descend Cutaneous to the surface of the shoulder from the cervical plexus (p. 57). A nerves- cutaneous branch of the circumflex nerve (fig. 78,2) turns forwards with a small companion artery front, beneath the posterior border of the deltoid, and supplies the integuments covering the lower two-thirds* of-the muscle. Dissection. The fat and fascia are now to be taken from the fleshy Dissection deltoid, its fibres being made tense for the purpose. Begirining at n™^"1 the anterior edge of the muscle, the dissector is to carry the knife upwards and downwards, following the direction of the coarse muscular fasciculi. As the posterior edge is approached, the cutaneous nerve and vessels escaping from beneath it are to be dissected out. * At the same time the fascia may be removed from the back of the scapula, so as to denude the muscles there. The deltoid muscle (fig. 78, p) is triangular in form, with the Deltoid base at the scapula and clavicle, and the apex at the humerus. It muscle ■ a/rises from the lower border of the spine of the scapula, from the origin, outer edge of the acromion, and from the outer half or third of the front of the clavicle. Its fihres converge to a tendon which is and inser- imserted into the rough triangular impression on the outer surface oftlon- the humerus, above the middle. The anterior border is contiguous to the pectoralis major muscle Adjacent and the cephalic vein ; and the posterior rests on the infraspinatus parts" and triceps muscles. The origin of the muscle from the bones of the shoulder corresponds with the insertion of the trapezius. At its insertion the tendon of the deltoid is united with that of the pectoralis major; and a fasciculus of the brachialis anticus is attached on each side of it. ' The middle or acromial portion of the deltoid is thicker than the it consists rest, and its fibres form large bundles which run obliquely between parts'^ tendinous septa prolonged from the origin and insertion of the muscle. The anterior or clavicular and posterior or spinous portions are somewhat separate from the foregoing, and their fibres converge to the anterior and posterior edges respectively of the lower tendon. Action. The acromial portion of the muscle raises the arm, which have abducting it from the body; the clavicular part flexes the shoulder- uses!6"* joint, moving the arm forwards and inwards ; and the spinous part draws the arm backwards, or extends the shoulder-joint.264 DISSECTION OP THE UPPER LIMB. Dissection to detach deltoid. Subacromial bursa. Parts covered by the deltoid. I Mssection of posterior circumflex vessels, Dissection (fig. 78). The deltoid is to be divided near its origin, and is to be thrown down as far as the circumflex vessels and nerve beneath will permit. As the muscle is raised a large thick bursa between it and the upper end of the humerus comes into sight. The loose tissue and fat are to be taken away from the circumlli x vessels and nerve ; and the size of the bursa having been looked to, the remains are to be removed. The insertion of the muscle should be defined. Parts covered by deltoid. The deltoid conceals the upper end of the humerus, and those parts of the dorsal scapular muscles which are fixed to the great tuberosity. A large bursa, sometimes divided into sacs, intervenes between the great tuberosity of the humerus and the under surface of the deltoid muscle and the acromion process. Lower down are the circumflex vessels and nerve, and the upper part of the biceps muscle. In front of the humerus is the coracoid process with its muscles. Dissection. By following back the posterior circumflex vessels and nerve through a space between the humerus and the long head of the triceps (<;), their connection with the axillary trunks will be arrived at.

Arching outwards in front of the humerus is the small anterior circumflex artery ; this is to be cleaned. The circumflex arteries arise near the termination of the axillary trunk (p. 254) ; they are two in number, and are named anterior and posterior from their position to the humerus. The anterior branch is a small artery, which courses beneath the coraco-brachiabs and biceps muscles, and ascends in the bicipital groove to the articulation and the head of the humerus : it anasto- moses with small offsets of the posterior circumflex. The posterior circumflex artery (fig. 78, a), much larger than the anterior, winds backwards through a space between the humerus and the long head of the triceps, and is distributed chiefly to the deltoid muscle, in which it anastomoses with the acronrio-thoracic artery. Branches are given from it to the shoulder-joint, and to anastomose with the anterior circumflex and superior profunda arteries. It supplies offsets also to the teres minor, the long head of the triceps, and the integuments. The circumflex nerve (fig. 78,1) leaves the arm-pit with the pos- terior circumflex artery (p. 256), and bends round the neck of the humerus, beneath the deltoid muscle in which it ends. Many large branches enter the deltoid; and one or two filaments pierce the muscle and become cutaneous. Branches. As the nerve passes backwards it gives an ariicidar filament to the under part of the shoulder-joint. Behind the humerus it furnishes a branch to the teres minor (s), which has a reddish gangliform swelling on it, and the cutaneous nerve f) before noticed, which turns round the edge of the deltoid.265 INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE. The infraspinatus mdscle (fig. 78, b) occupies the infraspinous Infraspina- fossa of the scapula, and extends to the upper end of the humerus. f™™8C8 The muscle arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula, ^ Qf ^ from the dorsal surface of the bone below that process, except at the name; neck and the narrow area along the axillary border where the teres muscles are attached, and from a special fascia covering it. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the middle insertion: impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and joins the Eig. 78. ♦ tendons of the supraspinatus and teres minor. The fleshy fibres arising from the spine overlay the tendon of the muscle. A part of the muscle is subcutaneous ; but the upper portion is relations concealed by the deltoid, and the lower angle by the latissinius dorsi. The lower border is- in contact with the teres minor, with which it is often united. The muscle lies on the scapula and the scapulo-humeral articulation ; and there is sometimes a small bursa between it and the capsule of the joint. Action. With the humerus hanging it acts as a rotator outwards ; arid "s° and when the bone is raised it will move the arm backwards in concert with the hinder part of the deltoid. * View of the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and of the circumflex vessels and nerve.

This muscle is partly covered by the deltoid : it rests on the long head of the triceps and the shoidder-joint. Underneath it the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery turns Action back ; the arm benT§fcaised, the teres depresses the humerus. The teres major muscle (fig. 78, d) passes from the inferior angle of the scapula to the humerus. Its origin is from an oval surface behind the inferior angle of the scapula, from the lower half of the axillary border of thmbone, and %om the intermuscular septum between it and the teres mror. The nqtoes end in a tendon which is inserted into the inner edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The muscle assists in forming the posterior fold of the axilla, and is situate beneath the axillary vessels and nerves near the humerus (fig. 72). The upper border is contiguous to the subscapularis muscle, and the lower is received into a hollow formed by the latissimus dorsi, which covers the teres behind at its origin, and in front at its insertion. At the humerus the tendon of the muscle is about two inches wide, and is placed behind that of the latissimus : the two are separated above by a bursa; but they are united below, and an expansion is sent from them to the fascia of the arm. A second bursa is frequently present between the teres and the bone. Action. If the limb hangs it is ffirried back behind the trunk, and is rotated inwards by the muscle. The hiunerus being raised, the muscle depresses and adducts^t. "With the limb fixed by the hand the teres will cause the lower angle of the scapula to move forwards. Below the scapula, where the teres muscles separate from one another, is a triangular interval^ which is bounded in front by the shaft of the humerus, and above and below by the teres minor and major (fig. 78). This space is divided into two by the long head of the triceps. Through the anterior part, which is of a quadri- lateral shape, the posterior circumflex vessels (a) and the circumflex nerve (') pass; and opposite the posterior triangular space, the dorsal branch (c) of the subscapular artery bends backwards. Dissection (fig. 79). Before sawing through the acromion process to expose the supraspinatus muscle, the ligaments of the scapula and clavicle should be examined. A strong ligament (coraco-clavicular) ascends from the coracoid process to the under part of the clavicle : on removing the areolar tissue it will be seen to consist of two parts, anterior and posterior, differing in size, and in the direction of the fibres.267 LIGAMENTS OF CLAVICLE AND SCAPULA. A capsular ligament, connecting the outer end of the clavicle with the acromion, will be shown by taking away the fibres of the trapezius and deltoid muscles. Another strong band (coraco-acromial) passing transversely a^dof^ between the acromion and the coracoid process, and a small fasci-' cuius (suprascapular ligament), placed over the notch in the superior "border, are then to be defined. Ligaments of the clavicle and scapula (fig. 79). The outer Union of tte end of the clavicle is connected to the scapula by a distinct joint scapula. Fig. 79.* with the acromion, and by a strong ligament (coraco-clavicular) between it and the coracoid process. The coraco-clavicular ligament consists of two portions, each Coraco-cla- . having a different direction and designation. VICU ar has The posterior piece ('), called conoid from its shape, is fixed by a conical its apex to the posterior and inner part of the coracoid process ; and by its base to the tubercle of the clavicle, at the junction of the outer with the middle third of the bone. The anterior part (2), trapezoid ligament, is larger than the conoid ; and a square it is attached below to the inner border of the coracoid process along the hinder half; and above to the line on the under surface of the clavicle, which extends outwards from the tubercle before mentioned. The two pieces of the ligament are in apposition behind, but are separated by an interval in front. Use. Both pieces of the ligament support the scapula in a state use of liga- of rest. They serve also to restrain the rotatory movements of that ment bone ; thus, when the acromion is rotated down, the motion is checked by the trapezoid band ; and when upwards, by the conoid piece. * Ligaments of the clavicle and scapula, and of the shoulder-joint (altered from Bourgery). 1.

The articular surfaces of the clavicle and acromion process of the scapula are connected together by a capsule, which is thick above (superior ligament), but very thin below. An interarticular fibre-cartilage is sometimes present at the upper part of the joint; and occasionally it forms a complete septum. If the fibro-cartilage is perfect, there are two synovial cavities in the joint; if it is imperfect, there is only one. The joint should be opened to see the cartilage and the synovial sac. Movements. This articulation allows the scapula to change its position in relation to the clavicle when the former bone is moved, either in gliding over the surface of the thorax, or in being rotated with the elevation and depression of the arm. Scapular ligaments. The special ligaments of the scapula are two in number, and extend from one point of the bone to another. The swprascapulwr ligament (4) is a narrow band stretching across the notch in the upper border of the scapula. By one end it is attached to the base of the coracoid process, aud by the other to the border behind the notch. It converts the notch into a foramen, through which the suprascapular nerve passes. The coraco-acromial ligament (3) is triangular in form, and extends transversely between the acromion and the coracoid process. Externally it is inserted by its apex into the tip of the acromion; and internally, where it is much wider, it is attached to all the outer border of the coracoid process, reaching backwards to the capsule of the shoulder-joint. The ligament consists usually of two thickened bands, anterior and posterior, with a thinner intervening part. It forms part of an arch above the shoulder-joint, which prevents the head of the humerus being displaced upwards. Dissection. To lay bare the supraspinatus muscle, the acromion process is to be sawn through, and to be turned aside with the outer end of the clavicle ; but in a repetition of the dissection of the upper limb, the bone may be left uncut for the purpose of seeing the use of the coraco-acromial arch. A strong fascia covers the surface of the muscle; this is to be taken away after it has been observed. The supraspinatus muscle (fig. 78, a) has the same form as the hollow of the bone which it fills. It arises from the surface of the supraspinous fossa of the scapula, except over the neck, from the upper side of the spine of the bone, and from the fascia covering its surface. Its fibres end in a tendon, which crosses over the shoulder-joint, and is inserted into the upper impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The muscle is concealed by the trapezius and the acromion process; and it rests upon the scapula, the suprascapular vessels and nerve, and the shoulder-joint. Its tendon joins that of the infraspinatus at the attachment to the humerus. Action. It comes into use with the acromial portion of the deltoid in raising the limb and supporting the joint. Dissection (fig. 83). The vessels and nerves on the dorsum ofDOESAL SCAPULAE VESSELS. 269 the scapula can be traced by detaching from behind forwards the scapular suprasprnatus and infraspinatus muscles, so as to leave a thin layer of vessels- the fleshy fibres with the ramifying blood-vessels on the surface of the bone. In the supraspinous fossa are the suprascapular vessels and nerve, which are to be followed beneath the acromion to the infraspinous fossa ; and entering the infraspinous fossa, beneath the teres minor muscle, is the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. The anastomosis between these vessels should be pursued in the fleshy fibres and cleaned. The suprascapular artery (a) is derived from the thyroid axis Supra- of the subclavian trunk (p. 70).

For the dissection of the superficial vessels and nerves on the front of the arm the limb should lie flat on the table, with the anterior surface uppermost. Dissection. The skin is to be raised from the fore aud hinder sur- faces of the arm and elbow. To reflect it, make one incision along the centre of the limb as far as two inches below the bend of the elbow, and at the termination of this, a second cut half round the forearm. Strip now the skin from the limb as low as the transverse incision, so that the fat which contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves may be denuded. Between the skin and the prominence of the olecranon a bursa may be seen. The cutaneous veins (fig. 80) may be sought first in the fat: they are very numerous below the bend of the elbow, as they issue from beneath the integument. One in the centre of the forearm is the median vein, which bifurcates rather below the elbow. External to this is a small vein (radial); and internal to it are the anterior and posterior idnar veins, coining from the front and back of the forearm. At the elbow these veins are united into two; one (basilic) is to be followed along the inner side, and the other (cephalic) along the outer side of the arm. The cutaneous nerves may be next traced out. Where they per- forate the deep fascia they lie beneath the fat; and this layer must be scraped through to find them. On the outer side of the arm, about the middle, two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral are to be sought. In the outer bicipital groove, in front of the elbow or rather below it, the cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve will be recognised. On the inner part of the limb the nerves to the surface are more numerous. Taking the basilic vein as a guide, the internal cuta- neous nerve of the forearm will be found by its side, about the middle of the arm; and a little external to this nerve is a small cutaneous offset from it, which pierces the fascia higher up. Scrape through the fat behind the internal cutaneous, in the lower third of the arm, for the small nerve of Wrisberg ; and in the upper third, follow the small nerves which have been already met with in the dissection of the axilla, viz., the intercosto-humeral, and the internal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral. Superficial fascia. The subcutaneous fatty layer forms a con- tinuous investment for the limb, but it is thicker in front of the elbow than in the other parts of the arm.. At that spot it encloses the superficial vessels and lymphatics. Cutaneous Veins. The position and relations of the veins inSUPERFICIAL VEINS. 271 front of the elbow are to be attentively noted by the dissector, because the operation of venesection is practised in one of them. The median vein of the forearm (fig. 80,2) divides into two branches, internal and external, rather below the bend of the elbow; and at its point of division it is joined by an offset from a deep vein. The internal branch (median-has ilic) crosses to the inner border of the biceps, and unites with the ulnar veins (3) to form the basilic vein of the inner side of the arm. The external branch (median- cephalic) is usually longer than the other, and by its junction with the radial vein (") gives rise to the cephalic vein of the arm. The median-cephalic vein is directed obliquely, and lies over the hollow between the biceps and the outer mass of muscles of the forearm; beneath it is the trunk of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. This vein is altogether removed from the brachial artery, and' is usually smaller than the median-basilic vein. If opened with a lancet it does not generally yield much blood, in consequence of its position in a hollow between muscles ^ rendering compression of it very uncertain Fig. 80.* and difficult. The median-basilic vein (') is more transverse in direction, and larger than the preceding ; and it crosses the brachial artery. It is firmly supported by the underlying fascia,—the aponeurosis of the arm, strengthened by an offset from the biceps tendon, intervening between it and the brachial vessels. Branches of the internal cutaneous nerve lie beneath it, and some twigs of the same nerve are placed over it. The median-basilic is the vein on which the operation of blood-letting is commonly performed. It is selected in consequence of its usually larger size, and more super- ficial position, and of the ease with which it may be compressed ; but from its close proximity to the brachial vessels, the spot to be opened should not be immediately over the trunk of the artery. The basilic vein (s), commencing as before said, ascends near the inner border of the biceps muscle to the middle of the arm, where it passes beneath the deep fascia, and is continued into the axillary vein. In this course it lies to the inner side of the brachial artery. The cephalic vein (2) is derived chiefly from the external Median vein divides into two branches.

The superficial lymphatics of the arm lie for the most pail along the basilic vein, and enter into the glands of the axilla. A few lymphatics accompany the cephalic vein, and end as the others in the axillary glands. One or more superficial lymphatic glands are commonly found a little above the inner condyle of the humerus. Cutaneous Nerves. The superficial nerves of the arm appear on the inner and outer sides, and spread so as to cover the surface of the limb. With one exception (intercosto-humeral) all are derived from the brachial plexus, either as distinct branches, or as offsets of other nerves. On the outer side of the limb are branches of the musculo-spiral and musculo-cutaneous nerves. On the inner side are two internal cutaneous nerves, large and small (from the plexus), a third internal cutaneous from the musculo-spiral, and the intercosto- humeral nerve. The EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS BRANCHES OF THE MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE are two in number, and appear at the outer side of the limb about the middle. The upper small one turns forwards with the cephalic vein, and reaches the front of the elbow, supplying the anterior part of the arm. The lower and larger pierces the fascia somewhat farther down, and after supplying some cutaneous filaments to the back of the arm, is continued to the forearm. The musculo-cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia in front of the elbow ; it lies beneath the median-cephalic vein, and divides into branches for the forearm. The internal cutaneous nerve perforates the fascia in two pieces, or as one trunk that divides almost directly into two. Its anterior branch passes beneath the mecban-basilic vein to the front of the forearm ; and the posterior winds over the inner condyle of the humerus to the back of the forearm. A slender offset of the nerve pierces the fascia near the axilla, and reaches as far, or nearly as far, as the elbow : it supplies the integuments over the biceps muscle. The nerve of Wrisberg (small internal cutaneous) appears behind the preceding, and extends to the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus, where it ends in filaments over the back of the olecranon. The nerve gives offsets to the lower third of the arm on the inner and posterior siufaces, and joins above the elbow the posterior branch of the larger internal cutaneous nerve. The internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, becoming subcutaneous in the upper third, winds to the back of the arm, and reaches nearly as far as the olecranon. The intercosto-humeral nerve, a branch of the second inter- costal (p. 244), perforates the fascia near the axilla, and ramifies on273 FASCIA AND MUSCLES OF THE ARM. the inner side and posterior surfade of the arm in the upper half.

Muscles on the Front of the Arm. There are only three Position of muscles on the front of the arm. The one along the centre of the of ti™ Tnn* limb is the biceps ; and that along its inner side, reaching about half way down, is the coraco-brachialis. The brachialis anticus lies beneath the biceps. Some muscles of the forearm are connected to the inner and outer condyles of the humerus, and to the ridge above the outer condyle. The biceps muscle (fig. 81,8; 82, b) forms the prominence seen Biceps has on the front of the arm. It is wider at the middle than at either taJSS? end; and the upper end consists of two tendinous pieces of dif- ferent lengths, which are attached to the scapula.

Parts covcr- ng in common with the coraco-brachialis muscle (fig. 77) ; and tbe long head is attached to the upper part of the head of the scapula, within the capsule of the shoulder-joint (fig. 93). Muscular fibres spring from each tendinous head, and meet to form a fleshy belly, which is somewhat flattened from before back. Inferiorly the biceps ends in a tendon, which is inserted into the tuberosity of the radius, having previously given off a slip to the fascia in front of the elbow. The muscle is superficial except at the extremities. At the upper part it is concealed by the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles ; and at the lower end the tendon dips into the hollow in front of and beneath the elbow. Beneath the biceps are the niusculo-cutaneous nerve, lt • the upper part of the humerus, and the brachialis anticus muscle, inner border Its inner border is the guide to the brachial artery below the middle tiieartery0 °^ tue humerus, but above that spot the coraco-brachialis muscle intervenes between them. The connection of the long head of the biceps with the shoulder-joint, and the insertion of the muscle into the radius will be afterwards learnt. Action. It bends the elbow-joint, and acts powerfully in supinating the radius. "When the body is hanging by the hands it will apply the scapula firmly to the humerus, and will assist in raising the trunk. With the arm hanging and the radius fixed, the long head will assist the abductors in removing the limb from the side : and after the limb is abducted, the short head will aid in restoring it to the pendent position. The coraco-brachialis (fig- 77, h) is partly concealed by the biceps, and extends to the middle of the arm. Its origin is fleshy from the tip of the coracoid process, and from the tendinous short head of the biceps. Its fibres become tendinous below, and are inserted into a narrow mark on the inner side of the humerus, below the level of .the deltoid : some of the fibres frequently end on an aponeurotic arch, which extends from the upper end of the humerus to the insertion of the muscle. The upper half of this muscle is beneath the pectoralis major (fig. 82) ; and its inner part projects beyond the short head of the biceps, forming a prominence in the axilla. Its insertion is covered by the brachial vessels and the median nerve. The coraco-brachialis lies over the subscapular muscle, the anterior circumflex vessels, and the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. Along the inner border are the large artery and nerves of the limb ; and the musculo- cutaneous nerve perforates it. Use on limb. Action. The coraco-brachialis moves forwards the arm, and adducts it to the thorax. The brachial artery (fig. 81,4) is a continuation of the axillary trunk, and supplies vessels to the upper limb.

The ulnar nerve (4) lies to the inner side as far as the insertion of the coraco- hrachialis muscle ; and the musculo-spiral (fig. 72, 4) is behind for a distance of two inches. The median nerve (fig. 82, ') is close to the vessel throughout, but alters its position in this way :—as low as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis it is placed on the outer side, but it then crosses obliquely over, or occasionally under the artery, and becomes internal about two inches above the elbow-joint.

Its branches arc muscular, superior profunda, inferior profunda, artery to bone, and anas- tomotic. Branches spring both externally and internally from the brachial artery (fig. 81). Those on the outer side, muscular, supply the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus, as well as the lower part of the deltoid ; those on the inner side are the superior and inferior profunda, the medullary artery of the humerus, and the anastomotic branch. The superior profunda branch (8) is larger than the others, and leaves the artery near the lower border of the teres major ; it winds backwards with the musculo-spiral nerve to the triceps muscle, and will be dissected with the back of the arm (p. 281). The inferior profunda branch (6) arises opposite the coraco- brachialis muscle, and accompanies the ulnar nerve to the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus. There it anastomoses with the posterior ulnar recurrent and anasto- motic branches, and supplies the triceps. It often arises in common with the superior profunda artery. The medullary artery of the humerus begins near the preceding branch, and enters the aperture about the middle of the humerus, being directed downwards. The anastomotic branch (") arises one or two inches above the elbow, and courses inwards through the intermuscidar septum to the hollow between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus.

The brachial veins (fig. 82, d) accompany the artery, one on v«d in each side and have branches of communication across that vessel; they receive tributary veins corresponding to the branches of the artery. Superiorly they usually join into one, which enters the axillary vein near the subscapular muscle. Fig. 82.* Nerves of the Arm (fig. 82). The nerves on the front of the Nerves on arm are derived from the terminal cords of the brachial plexus. frontofarm Few of them furnish offsets above the elbow, as they are continued, for the most part without branching, to the forearm and the hand.

The ulnar nerve (4), derived from the inner cord of thehracliial plexus, lies at first close to the inner Bide of the axillary, and then of the hrachial artery as far as the insertion of the coraco-hrachiali.s : leaving now the blood-vessel, it is directed backwards through the inner intermuscular septum to the interval between the olecranon and the internal condyle, being surrounded by the muscular fibres of the triceps. There is not any branch from the nerve till it reaches the elbow-joint. The internal cutaneous (2) is a tegumentary nerve of the fore- arm. Arising from the inner cord of the plexus, it is at first superficial to the brachial artery as far as the middle of the arm, Avhere it divides into two branches that perforate the investing fascia and reach the forearm (p. 284). Near the axilla it furnishes a small offset to the skin of the front of the arm. The nerve of Wrisberg (small internal cutaneous ;3) arises with the preceding. Concealed at first by the axillary vein, it is directed inwards beneath (but sometimes through) that vein, and joins with the intercosto-humeral nerve. Afterwards it lies along the inner part of the arm as far as the middle, where it perforates the fascia to end in the integument (p. 272). The musculocutaneous nerve, named from supplying muscles and integuments, ends on the surface of the forearm. It leaves the outer cord of the brachial plexus opposite the lower border of the pectoralis minor (p. 256), and immediately perforates the coraco- brachiahs : it is then directed obliquely to the outer side of the limb between the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles. At the front of the elbow it becomes a cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Branches. The nerve furnishes branches to the muscles of the front of the arm, viz., the coraco-brachialis as it passes through the fibres, and to the biceps and brachialis anticus where it is placed between them. Dissection. The brachialis anticus muscle will be brought into view by cutting through the tendon of the biceps near the elbow, and turning upwards this muscle. The fascia and areolar tissue should be taken from the fleshy fibres; and the lateral extent of the muscle should be well defined on each side, so as to show that it reaches the intermuscular septum largely on the inner side, but only for a short distance above on the outer side. Some care is required in detaching the brachialis externally from the muscles of the forearm, to which it is closely applied. As the muscles are separated the musculo-spiral nerve with a small artery comes into sight. The brachialis anticus (fig. 82, h) covers the elbow-joint and the lower half of the front of the humerus. It arises from the anterior surface of the humerus below the insertion of the deltoid muscle ; and from the intermuscular septa on the sides, viz., from all the inner, but from only the upper part of the outer. The fleshy fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the im- pression on the front of the coronoid process of the ulna (p. 2!)5).279 TRICEPS EXTENSOR OF ELBOW.

The inner border reaches the inter- of borders, muscular septum in all its length; but the outer is separated below from the external intermuscular septum by two muscles of the forearm, supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior.

The skin having been ab-eady reflected, the muscle will be laid bare readily, for it is covered only by fascia.

The middle or long head (a) has a tendinous origin, about an origin of inch wide, from the axillary margin of the scapula close to J^d16 the glenoid cavity, where it is united with the capside of the shoidder-joint. The outer head (b) is narrow and arises from the of outer back of the humerus, extending from the root of the large liead> tuberosity to the spiral groove.

Dissection of vessels and nerve. The triceps is superficial, except at the upper part where it is overlapped by the deltoid muscle. It lies on the humerus, and conceals the musculo-spiral nerve, the superior profunda vessels, and the aiticidation of the elbow. On the sides the muscle is united to the intermuscular septa ; and the lower fibres are con- tinuous externally with the anconeus—a muscle of the forearm. Action. All the pieces of the triceps combining in their action will bring the ulna into a line FiS- 83-* with the humerus, and extend the elbow-joint. As the long head passes the shoulder, it can depress the raised humerus, and adduct the bone to the thorax. The intermuscular septa are fibrous processes continuous with the investing aponeurosis of the arm, which are fixed to the ridges leading to the condyles of the humerus : they intervene between the muscles on the front and back of the limb, and give attachment to the fleshy fibres. The internal is the stronger, and reaches as high as the cora- co-brachialis muscle, from which it receives some tendinous fibres. The brachialis anticus is attached to it in front, and the triceps behind ; and the ulnar nerve, and the inferior profunda and anas- tomotic vessels pierce it. The external septum is thinner, and ceases at the deltoid muscle. Behind it is the triceps ; and in front are the brachialis anticus, and the muscles of the forearm (supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior) arising above the condyle of the humerus : it is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve and the accompanying vessels.

The internal cutaneous branch of the arm (fig. 82,6) is of small internal' size, and arises in the axillary space in common with the branch to £ranch"US the inner head of the triceps ; it is directed across the posterior boundary of the axilla to the inner side of the arm, where it becomes cutaneous in the upper third, and is distributed as before said (pp. 272 and 284). b.

Section IV. THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. Position of the limb. Surface of the forearm. Bony pro- jections. Line of the wrist-joint. Surface of palm of the hand. Position of palmar arch Surface of the fingers. Dissection Position. The limb is to be placed with the palm of the hand uppermost; and the marking of the surface and the projections of bone are first to be noted Surface-marking. On the anterior aspect of the forearm are two lateral depressions, corresponding with the position of the main vessels. The external is placed over the radial artery, and inclines towards the middle of the limb as it approaches the elbow. The internal groove is evident only below the middle of the forearm, and points out the place of the ulnar artery. The bones (radius and uma) are sufficiently near the surface to be traced in their whole length : each ends below in a point—the styloid process ; and that of the radius is the lower. A transverse line separates the forearm from the hand, and the articulation of the wrist is about three-quarters of an inch above it. On each side of the palm of the hand is a large projection ; the external of these (thenar) is formed by muscles of the thumb, and the internal (hypothenar) by muscles of the little finger. At the upper end of the latter the prominent pisiform bone is easily felt ; and towards the outer side of the -wrist, below the end of the radius, the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone is to be recognized. Between the muscular eminences is the hollow of the palm, which is pointed towards the wrist. Two transverse lines are seen in the palm, but neither reaches completely across it: they result from the bending of the fingers at the metacaqDO-phalangeal articulations, but the lower one is nearly half an inch above the three inner joints when the fingers are extended. The position of the superficial palmar arch of arteries is marked by the middle third of a line across the palm from the root of the thumb, when that digit is placed at a right angle to the hand. Transverse lines on the palmar aspects of the thumb and fingers correspond to the articulations of the phalanges ; but while the middle and lower ones are nearly opposite (about a line above) the two interphalangeal articulations, the upper one is fully half an inch below the metacarpophalangeal joint.

With the limb lying flat on the table, an incision is toSUPERFICIAL VEINS. 283 be earned through the skin along the middle of the front of the to remove forearm, as far as an inch beyond the wrist; and at its termination a transverse one is to cross it. The skin is to be reflected carefully from the front and back of the forearm, Avithout injury to the numerous superficial vessels and nerves beneath ; and it should be taken also from the back of the hand, by prolonging the ends of the transverse cut along each margin to a little beyond the knuckles. The whole of the fore finger should have the integument removed from it, in order that the nerves may be followed to the end. The superficial vessels and nerves can be now traced in the fat; Seek the they have the following position, and most of them have been partly vesseislnd dissected :—Along the inner side, with the ulnar veins, is the con- ™jj^s in tinuation of the internal cutaneous nerve ; and near the wrist there is occasionally a small offset from the ulnar nerve. On the outer side, with the radial vein, is the superficial part of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. Close to the hand, in the centre of the forearm, and inside the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis which can be rendered prominent by extending the wrist, the small pahnar branch of the median nerve should be sought beneath the fat. On the ulnar artery, close outside the pisiform bone, a small pahnar branch of the ulnar nerve is to be looked for. At the back of the forearm the large external cutaneous branch behind, of the musculo-spiral nerve is to be traced onwards ; and offsets are to be followed to this surface from the nerves in front. On the posterior part of the hand is a plexus of superficial veins. and].°°f'^e Winding back below the idna is the dorsal branch of the ulnar hand, nerve ; and lying along the outer border of the hand is the radial nerve : these shoidd be traced to the fingers. Cutaneous Veins. The superficial veins are named median, Subcuta- radial, and ulnar, from their position in the limb. neous veins: Dorsal plexus' of the hand. This network receives the super- plexus on ficial veins from both surfaces of the fingers; and from it, on the the haud 5 outer and inner sides, the radial and posterior ulnar veins proceed. The radial vein begins in the outer part of the plexus above radial; mentioned, and in some small radicles at the back of the thumb. It is continued along the forearm, at first behind and then on the outer border as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein by its union with the outer branch of the median vein (fig. 80, In many bodies a considerable branch passes from the lower part of the radial vein to join the median vein on the front of the forearm. The ulnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the ulnar, front and back of the limb :— The anterior begins near the wrist by the junction of small roots anterior from the hand, and runs on the inner part of the forearm to the elbow, where it opens either into the median-basilic or posterior ulnar vein (fig. 80,3). The posterior ulnar vein arises from the inner part of the dorsal and postc- plexus of the hand, and is continued along the back of the forearm rior;DISSECTION OF FRONT OF FOREARM. 284 median. Superficial nerves of forearm and back of hand are— internal cutaneous; external cutaneous; external cutaneous of musculo- spinal ; radial nerve, ending by external and internal branches, which supply digits; nearly to the elbow; here it bends forwards to join the inner branch of the median and form the basilic vein. The median vein takes origin near the wrist by small branches -which are derived from the palmar surface of the hand. It is directed along the centre of the forearm nearly to the elbow, and there divides into median-basilic and median-cephalic, which unite, as before seen (fig. 80,2), with the radial and ulnar veins. At its point of bifurcation the median receives a large communicating branch from the deep veins beneath the fascia. Cutaneous Nerves. Some of the superficial nerves of the fore- arm are confirmed from the arm :—those on the inner side from the large internal cutaneous nerve ; and those on the outer, from the lower external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral, and the musculocutaneous. On the fore part of the limb there is occasionally a small offset of the ulnar nerve near the wrist. On the back of the hand is the termination of the radial nerve, together with the dorsal' branch of the ulnar nerve. The internal cutaneous nerve (p. 272) is divided into two. The anterior branch extends on the front of the forearm as far as the wrist, and supplies the integuments on the inner half of the anterior surface. Near the wrist it communicates sometimes with a cutaneous offset from the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch continues along the back of the forearm (ulnar side) to the lower part. The musculocutaneous nerve (cutaneous part; p. 278) is pro- longed on the radial border of the limb to the ball of the thumb, over which it terminates in cutaneous offsets. Near the "wrist the nerve is placed over the radial artery, and some twigs pierce the fascia to ramify oil the vessel, and supply the carpal articulations. A little above the middle of the forearm the nerve sends backwards a branch to the posterior aspect, which reaches nearly to the wrist, and commimicates with the radial and the following cutaneous nerve. The EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS BRANCH OF THE MUSCULO-SPIRAL nerve (p. 272) descends along the hinder part of the forearm as far as the wrist. Near its termination it joins the preceding nerve. The radial nerve ramifies in the integument of the back of the hand and some of the digits. It becomes cutaneous at the outer border of the forearm in the lower third, and after giving some filaments to the posterior aspect of the limb, divides into two branches :— One (external) is joined by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and is distributed on the radial border and the ball of the thumb. The other branch (internal) supplies the remaining side of the thumb, both sides of the next two digits, and half the ring finger ; so that the radial nerve distributes the same number of digital branches to the dorsum as the median nerve furnishes to the palmar surface. This portion of the radial nerve communicates with the musculo-cutaneous and ulnar nerves ; and the offset to the con- tiguous sides of the ring and middle fingers is joined by a twig from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve.285 FASCIA OF FOREARM. The DORSAL BRANCH OF THE ULNAR NERVE gives offsets to the j»J ^j^™"011 rest of the fingers and the back of the hand. Appearing by the nerve to styloid process of the ulna, it joins the radial nerve in an arch across °nd the back of the hand, and is distributed to both sides of the little fingers, finger, and to the ulnar side of the ring finger : it communicates •with the part of the radial nerve furnished to the space between the ring and middle fingers; and sometimes it supplies this space entirely. The dorsal digital nerves are much smaller than those on the Extent of palmar aspect, and cannot be followed on the fingers farther than Angers, the base of the second phalanx. On the sides of the finger each com- municates with an offset from the palmar nerve. The aponeurosis of the forearm is continuous with the similar Deep fascia investment of the arm. It is of a pearly 'white colour, and is formed of fibres which cross obliquely. The membrane is thicker behind than in front, and is stronger near the elbow than towards the wrist. At the upper part it receives fibres from the tendon of the biceps in front, and of the triceps behind ; and it gives origin to the muscles springing from the condyles of the humerus. Longitudinal white lines indicate the position of deep processes (intermuscular septa), which separate the muscles, and give origin to their fleshy fibres. On the back of the forearm the fascia is attached to the hinder border of the ulna, and to the margins of a triangular surface at the upper end of that bone, which is left subcutaneous. At the wrist the fascia joins the anterior annular ligament; and At the near that band the tendon of the palmaris longus pierces it, and wnst' receives a sheath from it. Close to the pisiform bone there is an aperture through which the ulnar vessels and nerve enter the fat of the hand. Behind the wrist it is thickened by transverse fibres, posterior giving rise to the posterior annular ligament ; but on the back of ligament, the hand and fingers the fascia becomes very thin.

The skin is to be replaced on the back of the forearm Take away and hand, in order that the denuded parts may not become dry. love's and Beginning the dissection on the anterior surface of the limb, let the veins-' student divide the aponeurosis as far as the wrist, and take it away with the cutaneous vessels and nerves, except the small palmar cutaneous offsets of the median and ulnar nerves near the hand. In cleaning the muscles it will be impossible to remove the aponeu- rosis from them at the upper part of the forearm without cutting the muscular fibres. In front of the elbow is the hollow, already partly dissected, clean out between the two masses of muscles arising from the inner and outer of sides of the humerus. The space should be carefully cleaned, so as 6 ' to display the brachial and forearm vessels, the median nerve and branches, the musculo-spiral nerve, and the recurrent radial and ulnar arteries. In the lower half of the forearm a large artery, radial, is to be laid bare along the outer border ; and at the inner side, close to the annular ligament, the trunk of the ulnar artery will be recognised as it becomes superficial. These vessels and their blanches shouldDISSECTION OF FEONT OF FOIIEARM. 286 Define anterior annular ligament. Hollow in front of the elbow. Boundaries.

The anterior annular ligament of the wrist, which arches over the tendons passing to the hand, is next to be defined. This strong band is at some depth from the surface; and while the student removes the fibrous tissue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the palm of the hand. The ulnar vessels and nerve pass over the ligament, and will serve as a guide to its depth. Hollow in front of the elbow (fig. 84). This hollow is situate between the inner and the outer muscles of the forearm, and is some- what triangular in shape, with the wider jjart towards the humerus. It is bounded on the outer side by the supinator longus muscle, and on the inner side by the pronator teres. The aponeurosis of the limb is stretched over the space ; and the bones, covered by the brachialis anticus and supinator brevis, form the deep boundary. Contents. In the hollow are lodged the termination of the brachial artery, with its veins, and the median nerve ; the musculo-spiral nerve ; the tendon of the biceps muscle ; and small recurrent vessels, with much fat and a few glands. These several parts have the following relative position :—The tendon of the biceps is directed towards the outer boundary to reach the radius ; and on the outer side, concealed by the supinator longus muscle, is the musculo-spiral nerve. Nearly in the centre of the space are the brachial vessels and the median nerve, the nerve being internal; but as the artery is inclined to the outer side of the limb, they soon become distant from one another about half an inch. The brachial artery divides here into two trunks—radial and ulnar ; and the recurrent radial and ulnar branches appear in the space— the former on the outer, and the latter on the inner side. Two or three lymphatic glands lie on the sides of the artery, and one below its point of splitting. Muscles on the Front of the Forearm (fig. 84). The muscles on the front of the forearm are divided into a superficial and a deep group. In the superficial group there are five muscles, which are fixed to the inner condyle of the humerus by a common tendon, and lie in the undermentioned order from the outer to the inner side ;— pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris ; and deeper and larger than any of these is the flexor sublimis digitorum. The deep group will be met with in a subsequent dissection (p. 293). The pronator radii teres (fig. 84,3) arises from the inner con- dyle of the humerus by the common tendon ; from the ridge above the condyle by fleshy fibres ; from the inner edge of the coronoid process by a second tendinous slip ; and from the fascia, and the septum between it and the next muscle. It is inserted by a flat tendon into an impression, an inch in length, on the middle of the outer surface of the radius.FLEXOR CARPI RADIALIS. 287 Fig. 84. i The muscle is superficial except at the insertion, where it is covered by the radial artery, and some of the outer set of muscles, viz., supinator longus, and radial extensors of the wrist. The pronator forms the inner boundary of the triangular space in front of the elbow ; and its inner border touches the flexor carpi radialis. By gently separating the muscle from the rest, it will be found to lie on the brachialis anticus, the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the ulnar artery and the median nerve : the second small head of origin intervenes between the artery and nerve.' Action. The pronator assists in bringing forwards the radius over the idna, so as to pronate the hand. When the radius is fixed, the muscle raises that bone towards the humerus, bending the elbow-joint. The FLEXOR CARPI RADIALIS (fig. 84, 4) takes its origin from the common tendon, from the aponeurosis of the limb, and from the intermuscular septum on each side. The tendon of the muscle, becoming free from fleshy fibres about the middle of the forearm, passes through a groove in the trapezium, in a special sheath at the outer side of the anterior annular ligament, to be inserted mainly into the base of the meta- carpal bone of the index finger, and by a slip into that of the middle finger (p. 306). The muscle rests chiefly on the flexor siiblimis digitorum ; but near the wrist it lies over the flexor longus pollicis, — a muscle of the deep group. As low as the middle of the forearm the flexor carpi radialis corresponds externally with the pronator teres, and below that -with the radial artery, to which its tendon is taken as the guide. The ulnar border is in contact at first with the palmaris longus muscle, and for about two inches above the wrist, with the median nerve. Action. The hand being free, the muscle first flexes the wrist-joint, inclining the hand somewhat to the radial side ; and it will assist in bringing forwards the lower end of the radius in pronation. Still continuing to contract, it bends the elbow. Relations. Use on ratlins and elbow. Radial flexor of the wrist. Tlie muscle is super- ficial ; is the guide to radial artery.

Relations to muscles: in upper hall', The palmaris longus (fig. 84,6) is sometimes absent; or it may present great irregularity in the proportion between the fleshy and tendinous parts. It arises, like the preceding muscle, from the common tendon, the fascia, and the intermuscular septa. Its slender tendon is continued along the centre of the forearm ; and piercing the aponeurosis, it passes over the annular ligament to end in the palmar fascia, sending a slip to the abductor muscle of the thumb. The palmaris is situate between the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, and rests on the flexor sublimis digitoruni. Action. Rendering tense the palmar fascia, the palmaris will afterwards bend the wrist and elbow, like the last muscle. The flexor carpi ulnaris (fig. 84,') arises by a narrow slip in common with the other muscles from the inner condyle of the humerus, and from the intermuscular septum between it and the flexor sublimis digitoruni; and by a broad aponeurosis from the inner margin of the olecranon and the posterior border of the ulna for the upper two-thirds of its length. The fibres pass downwards and for- wards to a tendon on the anterior aspect of the muscle in the lower half, some joining it as low as the wrist; and the tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone. One surface of the muscle is in contact with the fascia ; and its tendon, which can be felt readily through the skin, serves as the guide to the ulnar artery. To its radial side are the palmaris and flexor sublimis digitorum muscles. When the attachment to the inner condyle has been divided, the muscle will be seen to conceal the flexor profundus digitorum, the ulnar nerve, and the ulnar vessels : between the attachments to the condyle and the olecranon the ulnar nerve enters the forearm. Action. The wrist is bent, and the hand is drawn inwards by the contraction of the muscle. The radial artery (fig. 84,1) is one of the vessels derived from the bifurcation of the brachial trunk, and extends to the palni of the hand. It is placed first along the outer side of the forearm as far as the end of the radius; next it winds backwards below the extremity of that bone ; and finally it enters the palm of the hand through the first interosseous space. In consequence of this cir- cuitous course the artery will be found in three different dissections, viz., the front of the forearm, the back of the wrist, and the palm of the hand. In the front of the forearm. In this region of the limb the position of the artery will be marked on the surface by a line from the centre of the hollow of the elbow to the fore part of the styloid process of the radius. This vessel is smaller than the ulnar artery, though it appears in direction to be the continuation of the brachial trunk. It is partly deep and partly superficial; and where it is super- ficial, it can be felt beating as the pulse near the wrist during life. In its upper half the vessel is placed beneath the supinator longus (8) ; and it rests successively on the following muscles,—the tendon of the biceps (9), the fleshy supinator brevis, the pronator teres (3), and part of the thin origin of the flexor sublimis (G).289 RADIAL ARTERY AND BRANCHES. In its lower half the artery is superficial, being covered only by In lower the integuments and the deep fascia. Here it is placed in a hollow ll!llf' between the tendons of the supinator longus (") and flexor carpi radialis (4). It lies from above down on the origin of the flexor sublimis, on two muscles of the deep group, viz., flexor longus pollicis and pronator quadratus, and lastly on the end of the radius. Veins. Venas comites lie on the sides, with cross branches over to veins; the artery. Nerve. The radial nerve is on the outer side of the artery in the to nerve, upper two-thirds of the forearm, but is separated from the vessels by a slight interval near the elbow. In the lower third the nerve passes backwards and becomes superficial behind the tendon of the supinator longus. Branches. The radial artery in this part of its course furnishes Branches: many unnamed muscular and cutaneous offsets, and three named branches, viz., recurrent radial, superficial volar, and anterior carpal. a. The radial recurrent is the first branch, and supplies the radial re- muscles on the outer side of the limb. Its course is abnost trans- cune ' verse to the supinator longus, beneath which it terminates in that muscle and the two radial extensors of the wrist. One offset ascends beneath the supinator, and anastomoses with the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. b. The superficial volar branch (fig. 87, c) is very variable in size, superficial and arises near the lower end of the radius. It is directed towards yolar> the palm of the hand, across or through the mass of muscles in the ball of the thumb ; and it either ends in those muscles, or joins the superficial palmar arch. c. The anterior carpal branch is very small, and will be seen in anterior the examination of the deep muscles. Arising rather above the end carl,al- of the radius, it passes transversely inwards at the lower border of the pronator quadratus, and anastomoses with a similar branch from the ulnar artery : from the arch thus formed, offsets are given to the carpus. Peculiarities of the radial artery. When the radial arises high in the aim, Variations its course is close to the brachial artery, along the edge of the biceps muscle; of the and in passing the bend of the elbow it is occasionally subcutaneous, i.e., above ralIialr the deep fascia, and liable to injury in venesection. In the forearm the artery al ery' may likewise be subcutaneous, and superficial to the supinator longus muscle. Dissection. To bring into view the flexor sublimis digitorum, the Dissection flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus must be cut through near sublimis the inner condyle of the hunierus, and turned to one side. Small branches of the ulnar artery and median nerve may be seen entering the under surfaces of those muscles. For the present, the pronator teres may be left uncut. The FLEXOR SUBLIJIIS DIGITORUM (flex. perforatllS ; fig. 84,6) is the Superficial largest of the superficial muscles, and is named from its position to nngcrs?f • another flexor in the deep set. It arises in common with the fore- Origin from going muscles from the inner condyle of the hunierus and the three bones intermuscular septa, also from the internal lateral ligament of the °fliWb"DISSECTION OF FRONT OF FOREARM. 290 Insertion.

Below the middle of the forearm the muscle ends in four tendons, which are continued beneath the annular ligament and through the hand, to be inserted into the middle phalanges of the fingers, after being perforated by the tendons of the deep flexor. The flexor sublimis is in great part concealed by the other muscles of the superficial group ; and the radial vessels lie on the attachment to the radius. Along the inner border is the flexor caipi ulnaris, with the ulnar vessels and nerve. The tendons of the muscle are arranged in pairs before thejr pass beneath the annular ligament of the wrist ;—the middle and ring finger tendons being anterior, and those of the index and little finger posterior in position. On dividing the condylar and coronoid attachments, tin- muscle will be seen to cover two deep flexors (flexor profundus digitorurn and flexor longus pollicis), the median nerve, and the upper part of the ulnar artery. Action. This flexor bends first the middle and then the proximal joints of the fingers ; but when the first phalanges are fixed by the extensor of the fingers, the superficial flexor moves the second phalanges alone. After the fingers are bent the muscle will help in flexing the wrist and elbow-joints. The ulnar artery (fig. 85, g) is the larger of the two branches coming from the bifurcation of the brachial trunk, and is directed along the inner side of the limb to the palm of the hand, where it forms the superficial palmar arch, and supplies most of the fingers. In the forearm the vessel has an arched direction ; and its depth from the surface varies in the first and last parts of its course. In the upper half the artery is inclined obliquely inwards from the centre of the elbow to the inner side of the limb. It courses between the superficial and deep muscles, being covered by the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor sublimis. Beneath it lie the brachialis anticus for a short distance, and the flexor profundus (c). In the lov;er half it has a straight course to the pisiform bone, and is covered by the integuments and fascia, and by the flexor carpi ulnaris. To the outer side are the tendons of the flexor sublimis. Beneath it is the flexor profundus (c). Veins. Two veins accompany the artery, and are united across it at intervals. Nerves. The median nerve (') lies to the inner side of the vessel for about an inch, but then crosses over it to gain the outer side, the corcnoid head of the pronator teres being placed between the two. Bather above the middle of the forearm the ulnar nerve (4) reaches the artery, and continues thence on the inner side ; and 0 small branch (5 ), sending twigs around the artery, courses on it to the palm of the hand.291 BRANCHES OF ULNAR ARTERY. On the annular ligament the artery has passed through the fascia, jgW»E and lies close to the pisiform hone. The ulnar nerve, with its palmar ligament, branch, still accompanies the vessel on the inner side, Branches. The greater number of the offsets of the artery are distributed to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- Fig. 85 * Its branches are muscular, anterior and posterior recurrent, ing :— a. The anterior ulnar recurrent branch frequently arises in common with the next, and ascends on the brachialis anticus muscle, to join the branch of the anastomotic artery beneath the pronator teres. It sives offsets to the conti- guous muscles. 6. The posterior ulnar recurrent branch (d), of larger size than the ante- rior, is directed beneath the flexor sublimis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. There it passes with the ubiar nerve be- tween the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the raniifica- tions of the inferior pro- funda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow-joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve. c. The interosseous artery is a short thick trunk, which is directed back- wards towards the inter- osseous membrane, and divides into anterior and posterior branches : the two divisions will be afterwards followed. * Dissection of the deep muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two groups of muscles.

The metacarpal branch arises from the artery near the lower end of the ulna, and runs along the metacarpal hone of the little finger, of which it is the inner dorsal branch. e. . The carpal brandies (anterior and posterior) ramify on the front and hack of the carpus, on which they anastomose with cor- responding offsets of the radial artery, and form arches across the wrist. The origin and course may vary. Peculiarities of ike ulnar artery. The origin of the artery may be trans- ferred to any point of the main vessel in the arm or axilla. In one instance R. Quain found the ulnar artery arising between two and three inches below the elbow. When it begins higher than usual, it is generally superficial to the flexor muscles at the bend of the elbow (only one exception, R. Quain), but beneath the aponeurosis of the forearm ; though sometimes it is subcutaneous with the superficial veins. Ulnar nerve in the fore- arm. Its branches are to elbow- joint, to 1 wo muscles of forearm, cutaneous branch of palm of hand, cutaneous nerve of back of baud. Median nerve lies between the two groups of muscles. The ulnar nerve (fig. 85,4) enters the forearm between the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the olecranon and inner condyle of the humerus. Under cover of that muscle the nerve reaches the ulnar artery somewhat above the middle (in length) of the forearm, and is continued on the inner side of the vessel to the hand. On the annular ligament the nerve is rather deeper than the artery. It gives off the following branches :— <(. Articular nerves. In the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle, slender filaments are furnished to the joint. b. Muscular branches arise from the nerve near the elbow, and supply the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner half of the flexor pro- fundus digitorum. c. Cutaneous nerve of the forearm anal hand. A small palmar branch (5) arises about the middle of the forearm, and descends on the ulnar artery, sending twigs around that vessel, to end in the integuments of the palm' of the hand : sometimes a cutaneous off- set perforates the aponeurosis near the wrist, and joins the internal cutaneous nerve. d. The dorsal cutaneous nerve of the hand leaves the trunk about two inches above the end of the ulna, and passes obliquely backwards beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris ; perforating the aponeurosis, it is distributed on the back of the hand and fingers (p. 285). The median nerve (fig. 85,l) leaves the hollow of the elbow between the heads of the pronator teres, and runs in the middle line of the limb to the hand. It is placed beneath the flexor sublimis as low as two inches from the annular ligament, where it becomes superficial along the outer border of the tendons of that muscle.

The radial nerve is the smaller of the two branches into which ?aJ?jaljJu"!e the musculo-spiral divides at the elbow. This nerve is placed along the outer border of the limb, under cover of the supinator longus (tig. 84), and on the outer side of the radial artery, to the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the forearm, where it becomes cutaneous at the posterior border of the supinator tendon. It finally it ends on divides into two branches, which are distributed on the dorsum of ° 0 the hand and digits (p. 284). No muscular offset is furnished by the nerve. Dissection (fig. 85). To examine the deep layer of muscles it will Dissection be necessary to draw well over to the radial side of the forearm the u^ies: pronator teres, to detach the flexor sublimis from the radius, and to remove its fleshy part. A thin layer of fascia, winch is most distinct near the wrist, is to be taken away ; and the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve, which lie on the interosseous mem- brane, and are concealed by the muscles, are to be traced out. Over the ends of the forearm-bones the arch of the anterior carpal show carpal arteries may be defined. aicl1' Deep Group of Muscles. There are three deep muscles on the Three mus- front of the forearm. One, covering the ulna, is the deep flexor of Seep1"^116 the fingers ; a second rests on the radius, the long flexor of the thumb ; and the third is the pronator quadratus, which lies beneath the other two, over the lower ends of the bones. The flexor profundus digitorum (flex, perforans ; fig. 85, c) Deep flexor arises from the anterior and inner surfaces of the ulna for three- offiI1seIs: fourths of the length of the bone, from the inner half of the origin; interosseous ligament for the same distance, and from the aponeurosis of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The muscle has a thick fleshy belly, and ends in tendons which, passing beneath the annular ligament, are inserted into the last phalanges of the fingers, insertion. Lying over the muscle are the ulnar vessels and nerve, the Parts superficial flexor of the fingers, and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The arouml ifc' deep surface rests on the ulna and the pronator quadratus muscle. The outer border touches the flexor longus pollicis and the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve. The portion of the muscle furnish- ing the tendon to the index finger is separated from the rest by a layer of areolar tissue. Action. The muscle bends the joints of the fingers and the wrist; use on but it does not act on the last phalanx till after the second has been <in>'ers a!ul moved by the flexor sublimis.

The plexor longus pollicis (fig. 85, b) arises from the anterior surface of the radius, as low as the pronator quadratus, and from the outer part of the interosseous membrane; it is also joined in most cases by a distinct slip arising in common with the flexor sublimis digitorum either from the internal condyle of the humerus or the coronoid process of the ulna. The fleshy fibres descend to a tendon, which is continued beneath the annular ligament, and is inserted into the last phalanx of the thumb. The greater part of the muscle is covered by the flexor sublimis digitorum ; and the radial vessels rest on it for a short distance below. It lies on the radius and the pronator quadratus. To the inner side is the flexor profundus digitorum. Action. This muscle is the special flexor of the last joint of the thumb, but it also aids in bending the other joints of that digit and the wrist. The pronator quadratus (fig. 85, d) is a flat muscle, covering the lower fourth of the bones of the forearm. It arises from the anterior surface of the ulna, where it is somewhat widened, and is inserted into the fore and inner parts of the radius for about two inches. The anterior surface is covered by the tendons of the flexor muscles of the digits, and by the radial vessels ; and the posterior surface rests on the radius and ulna with the intervening membrane, and on the interosseous vessels and nerve. Along its lower border is the arch formed by the anterior carpal arteries. Action. The end of the radius is moved inwards over the ulna by this muscle, and the hand is pronated. The anterior interosseous artery (fig. 85, e) is continued on the front of the interosseous membrane, between the two flexors or in the fibres of the flexor profundus digitorum, till it reaches an aperture in the membrane beneath the pronator quadratus. At that spot the artery turns from the front to the back of the limb, and descends to the back of the carpus, where it ends by anastomosing with the posterior interosseous and carpal arteries. Branches. Numerous offsets are given to the deep muscles. One long branch, median (/), accompanies the median nerve, which it supplies, and either ends in the flexor sublimis, or is con- tinued beneath the annular ligament to the palmar arch. Above the middle of the forearm the medullary arteries of the radius and ulna arise from the vessel. Where it is about to pass through the interosseous membrane it furnishes twigs to tbe pronator quadratus ; and one branch is continued beneath that muscle to anastomose with the anterior carpal arteries. The anterior interosseous nerve (fig. 85,2) is derived from the median, and accompanies the artery of the same name to the pro- nator quadratus muscle, the under surface of which it enters. Branches are given by it to the deep flexor muscles.295 DISSECTION OF THE HAND. Dissection.

After it has been examined it may be thrown inwards with the skin. Action-. It draws outwards and wrinkles the skin of the inner side of the palm-. The. palmar fascia or aponeurosis consists of a central and two lateral parts ; but the lateral, which cover the muscles of the thumb and little finger, are so thin as not to require a special notice.

Above, the fascia receives the tendon of the palmaris longus, and is con- nected to the annular ligament ; and below, it ends in four processes, which are continued downwards, one for each finger, to the sheaths of the tendons. At the point of separation of the pieces from one another some transverse fibres are placed, which arch over the lumbri- ealis muscle and the digital vessels and nerve appearing at this spot. From the pieces of the fascia a few superficial longitudinal fibres are prolonged to the integuments near the cleft of the fingers. Dissection.

Each process of the fascia sends back- wards an offset on each side of the tendons, which is fixed to the deep ligament connecting together the heads of the metacarpal bones, and to the edge of the metacarpal bone for a short distance. The superficial transverse ligament of the fingers is a thin fibrous band, which stretches across the roots of the four fingers, and is contained in the fold of skin, forming the rudiment of a web between them. Beneath it the digital nerves and vessels are con- tinued onwards to their terminations.

On the removal of the fascia the palmar arch of the ulnar artery, and the median and ulnar nerves become apparent. Palmar part of the ulnar artery (fig. 87). In the palm Superficial of the hand the ulnar artery is directed towards the muscles of the arch: thumb, where it communicates with two offsets of the radial trunk, viz., the superficial volar branch (c), and the branch to the radial side of the forefinger (/). The curved part of the artery, which lies across the hand, is named the superficial palmar arch (d). Its position in convexity is turned towards the fingers, and its position in the tlie « ' pabn would be nearly marked by a line across the hand from the cleft of the thumb. The arch is comparatively superficial, being covered for the most relations, part only by the integuments and the palmar fascia; but at the inner border of the hand the palmaris brevis muscle (h) lies over it.

Finally, the sheaths of the fingers may he opened in order to show the insertion of the tendons. Flexor tendons. Beneath the annular ligament the tendons of the deep and superficial Hexors are surrounded by a large and loose synovial membrane, which projects upwards into the forearm and downwards into the hand, ami sends an offset into the digital sheath of the thumb, and sometimes one into that of the little finger. Flexor sublimis. The tendons of the flexor sublimis are superficial to those of the deep flexor beneath the ligament; and all lour are nearly on the same level, instead of being arranged in pairs as in the forearm. After crossing the palm of the hand they enter the digital sheaths (fig. 86, c) ; and each is inserted by two processes into the margins of tin; middle phalanx, about the centre. As it enters the sheath, the tendon of the flexor sublimis conceals that of the flexor profundus ; but opposite the lower half of the first phalanx it is split for the passage of the latter tendon. Dissection. To see the tendons of the deep flexor and the lum- brical muscles, the flexor sublimis must be cut through above the wrist, and thrown towards the fingers. Afterwards the synovial membrane and areolar tissue should be taken away. Flexor profundus. At the lower border of the annular ligament the tendinous mass of the flexor profundus is divided into four pieces, though in the forearm only the tendon of the index finger is distinct from the rest. From the ligament the four tendons are directed through the hand to the fingers ; and in their course they give origin to the small lumbricales muscles. At the root of the finger each enters the digital sheath Avith a tendon of the flexor sublimis, and having passed through that tendon, is inserted into the base of the last phalanx. Between both flexor tendons and the bones are short folds of the synovial membrane, one for each. By means of this each tendon is connected with the capsule of the joint, and the loAver part of the phalanx immediately above the bone into which it is inserted. The lumbricales (fig. 88, i) are four small muscular slips, which arise from the tendons of the deep flexor near the annular ligament; the outer two sprmging each from a single tendon, while the inner two are connected each with two tendons. They are directed to the radial side of the fingers, to be inserted into the expanded extensor tendon on the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal phalanx (fig. 86, c). These muscles are concealed for the most part by the tendons and vessels that have been removed ; but they are subcutaneous for a short distance between the processes of the palmar fascia. Action. The lumbricales assist in bending the metacarpo- phalangeal joints ; and by their insertion into the extensor tendons they straighten the interphalangeal joints. Tendon of the flexor lowjus pollicis.

Short Muscles of the Thumb (fig. 88). These are four inFourmus- number, and are named from their action on the thumb. The tJ^na"the most superficial is the abductor pollicis (a) ; beneath it is the opponens pollicis (b), which will be recognised by its attachment to the whole length of the metacarpal bone. To the inner side of the last is the bifid short flexor (c) ; and the wide muscle coming from the third metacarpal bone is the adductor of the thumb (d). The abductor pollicis (a) is the most superficial muscle, and Abductor: is about an inch wide. It arises from the upper part of the annular ligament on the outer side, and from the tuberosity of the scaphoid attach- bone ; and it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the meuts' thumb at the radial margin. The muscle is subcutaneous, and rests on the opponens pollicis : relations; it is joined at its origin by a slip from the tendon of the palmaris longus, and often by one from the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Action. The abductor pollicis moves the thumb in the direction and use. of its radial border away from the index finger. Dissection. The opponens pollicis will be seen on cutting through Dissection, the abductor. To separate the muscle from the short flexor on the inner side, the student should begin near the head of the metacarpal bone, where there is usually a slight interval. The opponens pollicis (b) arises from the annular ligament Opponens beneath the preceding, and from the outer side of the ridge of the metacarpal trapezium ; and it is inserted into the outer surface and radial border bone. of the metacarpal bone for the whole length.

In the Two or three hypothenar eminence there are the abductor and opponens muscles Jl"^1^ of the little finger, and sometimes a short flexor. The abductor minimi digiti (e) is superficial to the opponens Abductor muscle. It arises from the pisiform bone, and is inserted into the is beneath ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger ; 8 ' an offset from it reaches the extensor tendon on the back of the phalanx.

Branches: recurrent; perforating; palmar in- terosseous. Digital ■branches : artery of the thumb : artery of the fore- linger. Deep branch of ulnar nerve: muscular offsets. Transverse ligament of metacarpus. The deep palmar arch (c) extends from the first interosseous space to the base of the metacarpal hone of the little finger, where it joins the tleep branch of the ulnar artery (6). Its convexity, which is but slight, is directed downwards ; and its situation is nearer the carpal b..m-s than that of the superficial arch. The arch has a deep position in. the hand, and lies on the metacarpal bones and the interosseous muscles. It is covered by the long flexor tendons, and in part by the flexor brevis pollicis and opponens minimi digiti muscles. Two veins accompany it. The branches of the arch are the following :— . a. Recurrent branches pass from the concavity of the arch to the front of the carpus ; these supply the bones and joints, and anasto- mose with the anterior carpal arteries. 6. Three perforating arteries pierce the inner three dorsal interos- seous muscles, and communicate with the interosseous arteries on the back of the hand. c. Usually there are three palmar interosseous arteries (/), which lie over the inner three metacarpal spaces, and terminate by joining the digital branches of the superficial palmar arch at the clefts of the tinkers. An offset of the inner one, or a separate branch of the arch, joins the digital artery to the inner side of the little finger (p. 297). These branches supply the interosseous muscles, and the two or three inner lumbricales : they vary much in their size and arrangement. </. Digital branches of the radial. The large artery of the thumb (e) runs between the first metacarpal bone and the flexor brevis pollicis to the interval between the heads of that muscle, where it divides into the two collateral branches of the thumb : these are distributed like the arteries of the superficial arch (p. 297). e. The radial digital branch of the index finger (d) is directed over the first dorsal interosseous muscle (j), and beneath the short flexor and the adductor pollicis, to the radial side of the fore finger. At the lower border of the adductor pollicis (d), this branch is usually connected by an offset with the superficial palmar arch; and at the end of the digit it unites with the branch furnished to the opposite side by the umar artery. The deep part OP the ulnar nerve (2) accompanies the arch of the radial artery as far as the muscles of the thumb, and terminates in offsets to the adductor pollicis and the deep part of the short flexor. Branches. Near its origin the nerve furnishes branches to the muscles of the little finger. In the palm it gives offsets to all the palmar and dorsal interosseous muscles, and to the inner two lum- brical muscles (3), besides the terminal branches before mentioned. The transverse metacarpal LIGAMENT is formed by cross fibres uniting the palmar ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal articula- tions of the fingers, and serves to bind together the heads of the inner four metacarpal bones. To its upper border the fascia cover- ing the interosseous muscles is attached. The ligament should now be taken away to see the interosseous muscles.INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 305 The interosseous muscles, so named from their position between the metacarpal bones, are seven in number. Two muscles occupy each space, except the first, where there is only one. They arise from the metacarpal bones, and are inserted into the first phalanges of the fin«ers. They are divided into palmar and dorsal ; but all are seen in the palm of the hand, though the former project more than the others. The palmar muscles (fig. 89), tbree in number, are smaller than the dorsal, and have each a single origin from the side of the Seven inter- osseous muscles, divided into palmar and dorsal. Palmar go to index, ring and little fingers. Fig. 89.* Fig. 90.+ metacarpal bone of the finger to which it belongs. The first is placed on the idnar side of the index finger, the second and third on "the radial side of the ring and little fingers respectively. The dorsal muscles (fig. 90), one in each space, arise by two heads Dorsal: two from the lateral surfaces of the metacarpal bones between which they ii(ng"1^l01n!e lie. The first (abductor indicis) is inserted on the radial side of each the index finger, the spcond on the radial, and the third on the ami ri,,j ulnar side of the middle finger, and the fourth on the ulnar side of lingers, the ring finger. Both sets of muscles have a similar termination (fig. 86, b) :— common ■ The fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted into the side of the first ^0^*3°^of or metacarpal phalanx, and sends an expansion to join the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the bone.

The interosseous muscles also separate and approximate the straightened fingers, the palmar set adducting the index, ring and little fingers towards the middle digit; while the dorsal abducl their fingers from the median line of the hand, the two fixed to the middle finger moving it to either side of that line. Dissection. The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal hones on each side are next to he dissected out by taking away the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. Before reading its description, the ends of the cut ligament maybe placed in appo- sition, and fixed with a stitch. The anterior annular ligament is a broad band, which arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is attached internally to the pisiform and unciform hones, and ex- ternally to the tuberosity of the scaphoid and the ridge of the trapezium, as well as by a deeper process to the trapezoid bone on the inner side of the groove for the flexor carpi radialis. By its upper border it is continuous with the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and on its anterior surface it is joined by the palmar fascia. Over it lie the palmaris longus tendon and the ulnar vessels and nerve. Dissection. Next follow the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis to its insertion into the metacarpal bones, by dividing the overlying part of the anterior annular ligament. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, in passing from the fore- arm to the hand, lies in the groove in the trapezium between the attachments of the annular ligament, hut outside the arch of that band ; here it is bound down by a fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane. The tendon is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, and sends a slip to that of the middle digit. Section VI. Position. Take away the super- ficial nerves and the fascia. Strip fingers. Separate muscles. THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. Position. During the dissection of the hack of the forearm the limb lies on the front, and a small block is to be placed beneath the wrist for the purpose of stretching the tendons. Dissection (fig. 91). The fascia and the cutaneous nerves and vessels are to be reflected from the muscles of the forearm, and from the tendons on the back of the hand ; but in removing the fascia in the forearm, the student must be careful not to cut away the posterior interosseous vessels, which are in contact with it on the ulnar side in the lower third. A thickened band of the fascia opposite the carpus (the posterior annular ligament) is to be left. Let the integument he removed from the fingers, iu order that the tendons may he traced to the end of the digits. The several muscles should be separated from one another up to their origin, especially the t wo radial extensors of the wrist,307 SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES. The POSTERIOR ANNULAR LIGAMENT (k) is a part of the deep Ammlar fascia thickened by the addition of transverse fibres, and is situate behind the the lower ends of the Fig. 91/ opposite bones of the forearm. This bund is attached on the outer side to the radius; and on the inner to the pyramidal and pisiform bones. Processes from it are fixed to the bones beneath, and confine the- extensor tendons. The ligament will subsecmently be examined more in detail. Superficial Layer of Muscles (fig. 91). The muscles of the back of the forearm are arranged in a superficial and a deep layer. The superficial layer contains seven muscles, -which arise, in part by a common tendon, from the outer side of the humerus, and are placed in the following order from without inwards ;—the long supinator (a), the long and short radial extensors of the wrist (b and c), the common extensor of the fingers (d), the ex- tensor of the little finger '(e), and the ulnar extensor of the wrist (f). There is one other small muscle near the elbow—the anconeus (g). The SUPINATOR RADII LOXGUS (a) reaches upwards into the arm, and limits on the outer side the hollow in front of the elbow. The muscle arises from the upper two-thirds of the external supracondylar ridge of the humerus, and from the front of the external intermuscular septum of the arm. The fleshy fibres end about the middle of the forearm in a tendon, which is inserted into the lower end of the-radius, close above the styloid process. In the arm the margins of the supinator are directed towards the surface and the bone, but in the fore- arm the muscle is flattered over the others, with its edges forwards and backwards. Its anterior Superficial layer has seven mus- cles. Supinator longus: origin ; insertion ; relations; * Superficial dissection of the back of the forearm. (Illustrations of Dis- sections.)

Extensor carpi radialis brevior: origin; insertion: parts around it; and use. Common extensor of fingers : border touches the biceps and the pronator teres ; and the posterior is in contact with both radial extensors of the wrist. Near its insertion the supinator is covered by two extensors of the thumb. Beneath the muscle are the bracbialis anticusand the musculo-spira] nerve, the extensors of the wrist, the radial vessels and nerve, and the radius. Action. The chief use of the supinator longus is to bend the elbow-joint; but if the radius is either forcibly pronated or supinated, the muscle can put the hand into a state intermediate between pro- nation and supination. If the radius is fixed, as in climbing, the muscle will bring up the humerus, bending the elbow. The extensor carpi radialis longior (b) arises from the lower third of the external supracondylar ridge of the humerus, from the front of the contiguous intermuscular septum, and from the septum between it and the next muscle. It lies on the short radial extensor, being partly covered by the supinator longus ; and its tendon passes beneath the extensors of the thumb, and the annular ligament, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Along its outer border lies the radial nerve. Action. The long extensor first straightens the wrist, and then bends the elbow-joint. If the hand is fixed in climbing, it will act on the humerus like the long supinator. The extensor carpi radialis brevior (c) is attached to the outer condyle of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the three following muscles, viz., common extensor of the fingers, extensor of the little finger, and ulnar extensor of the wrist; it takes origin also from the external lateral ligament of the elbow- joint. The tendon of the muscle is closely applied to the preceding, and after passing with it through the same compartment of the anmdar ligament, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Concealed on the outer side by the two preceding muscles, this extensor rests on the radius and two of the muscles attached to it, viz., supinator brevis, and pronator teres. Along the ulnar side is the common extensor of the fingers; and the extensors of the thumb issue between the two. Both radial extensors of the carpus have usually a bursa beneath the tendon, close to the insertion. Action. This muscle acts with its fellow in extending the wrist. The extensor communis digitordm (d) is single at its origin, but is divided below into four tendons.

At the lower part of the forearm the muscle origin; ends in four tendons, which pass through a compartment of the division into annular ligament with the indicator muscle, and are directed along ^gUd0ng; the hack of the hand to their insertion into the second and third phalanges of the fingers. On the fingers the tendons have the following arrangement. On insertion the dorsum of the first phalanx each forms an expansion with the phalanges, tendons of the hunbricalis and interosseous muscles (fig. 86). At the lower part of that phalanx the expansion divides into three parts (fig. 91, n) ;—the central one is fixed into the base of the second phalanx, while the lateral pieces unite, and are inserted into the base of the last phalanx. Opposite the first two artievdations of each finger the tendon sends down lateral bands to join the capsule of the joint. On the fore and little fingers the expansion is joined by the special tendons of those digits. This muscle is placed between the extensors of the wrist and Relations of little finger, and conceals the deep layer. On the back of the the muscle- hand the tendons are joined by cross bands (l) which are strongest between the ring finger tendon and its collateral tendons; they prevent the ring finger being raised if the others are closed. Action. The muscle straightens the fingers and separates them Use, from each other. It acts especially on the first phalanges, the two g"„Jie fin" interphalangeal joints being extended mainly by the interosseous and livmbricales muscles. The digits being straightened, it will assist the other muscles in on elbow extending the wrist and the elbow. an wrist" The extensor Mixmi digiti (e) is the most slender muscle on Extensor of the back of the forearm, and appears to be but a part of thelittle finger' common extensor. Its origin is in common with that of the origin; extensor communis, but it passes through a distinct sheath of the annular ligament. Beyond the ligament the tendon splits into two, termination; and the outer part is joined by the fourth tendon of the common extensor: finally, both parts enter the common expansion on the first phalanx of the little finger. Action. It extends the little finger and moves back the wrist and and use. elbow. As the inner piece of the split tendon is not united with the common extensor, it can straighten the digit during flexion of the other fingers. The EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS MUSCLE (p) arises from the common Extensor tendon, the aponeurosis of the forearm, and an intermuscular septum rfsT Ul"a" on its outer side ; it is also fixed by fascia to the posterior border of the ulna below the anconeus muscle (about the middle third). Its origin; tendon becomes free from fleshy fibres near the annular ligament, and passes through a separate sheath in that structure to be inserted into insertion; the tuberosity at the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Beneath this extensor are some of the muscles of the deep layer, relations; with part of the ulna. On the outer side is the extensor of the little finger, with the posterior interosseous vessels. Action, The ulnar extensor straightens the wrist, and inclines the a„d use. hand towards the ulnar side : it can then extend the elbow-joint.310 DISSECTION OF BACK OF FOllEAEM.

Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis : origin; insertion. The muscle is at first deep, but afterwards superficial. Use. The anconeus (g) is a small triangular muscle near the elbow. It arises from the outer condyle of the humerus by a tendon distinct from, and on the ulnar side of the common tendon of the foregoing muscles. From this origin the fibres diverge to their insertion into the outer side of the olecranon, and into the impression on the upper third of the posterior surface of the ulna. The upper fibres are nearly transverse, and are contiguous to the lowest of the triceps muscle. Beneath the anconeus lie the supi- nator brevis muscle, and the interosseous recurrent vessels. Action. It assists the triceps in extending the elbow. Dissection (fig. 92). For the display of the deep muscles at the back of the forearm, and of the posterior interosseous vessels and nerve, three of the superficial muscles, viz., extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris, are to be divided above and turned aside ; and the small branches of the nerve and artery entering these muscles may be cut. The loose tissue and fat are then to be removed from the muscles, and from the ramifications of the artery and nerve; and a slender part of the nerve, which sinks beneath the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb about the middle of the forearm, should be traced beyond the wrist. The separation of the muscles should be made carefully, since the outer two of the thumb are not always very distinct from each other. Deep Layer of Muscles (fig. 92). In this layer there are five muscles, viz., one supinator of the forearm, and four special extensor muscles of the thumb and index finger. The highest muscle, partly surrounding the upper third of the radius, is the supinator brevis (d). Below this are the three muscles of the thumb in the following order ;—the extensor of the metacarpal bone (e), the extensor of the first (f), and that of the second phalanx (g). On the ulna the indicator muscle (h) is placed. The extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (e) is the largest and highest of the extensor muscles of the thumb, and is sometimes united with the supinator brevis. It arises from the posterior surface of the radius in its middle third, below the supinator brevis, from a special narrow impression on the ulna, occupying the upper third of the outer division of the posterior surface, and from the intervening interosseous membrane. The tendon is directed out- wards over the radial extensors of the wrist, and through the annular ligament, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and by a slip into the trapezium : another slip is frecptently continued to the abductor pollicis. The muscle is concealed at first by the common extensor of the fingers ; but it becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the forearm between the last muscle and the radial extensors of the wrist (tig. 91). Opposite the carpus the radial artery winds backwards beneath its tendon. Between the contiguous borders of this muscle and the supinator brevis the posterior interosseous artery (a) appears. Action. By this muscle the thumb is carried outwards and back- wards from the palm of the hand, and the hand is moved to the radial side.311 EXTENSORS OF THUMB. and use. Extensor of second phalanx: origin; Tlie extexsor primi interxodii pollicis (p) is the smallest jjj^j|or muscle of the deep layer, and its tendon accompanies that of the phalanx: preceding extensor. Its origin, about one inch in width, is from the origin; radius and the interosseous mem- brane, close below the attachment of the last muscle. The tendon passes through the same space in the annular ligament as the exten- sor of the metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first '.t^ISi insertion; phalanx of the thumb. With respect to surrounding parts this muscle has similar relations to the preceding. Action. It extends first the proxi- mal phalanx, and then the meta- carpal bone, like its companion. The EXTENSOR SECDNDI IXTER- nodii pollicis (g) arises from the middle third or more of the ulna below the anconeus, along the ulnar side of the extensor of the meta- carpal bone ; and from the interos- seous membrane below, for about an inch. Its tendon, passing through a distinct sheath in the annular ligament, is directed along the dor- sum of the thumb to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx. The belly of the muscle is covered by the extensor carpi id- naris and the extensors of the fingers, but the tendon becomes superficial close to the wrist.

Near the wrist the tendon becomes free from muscular fibres, and passing beneath the annular ligament with the common extensor of the fingers, is applied to, and blends with the external tendon of that muscle in the expan- sion on the first phalanx of the fore finger. Until this muscle has passed the ligament it is covered by the superficial layer, but it is afterwards subaponeurotic. Action. The muscle can point the fore finger even when the three inner fingers are bent; and it will help the common extensor of the digits in drawing back the hand. Dissection. To lay bare the supinator brevis, it will be necessary to detach the anconeus from the external condyle of the humerus, and to cut through the supinator longus and the radial extensors of the wrist. After those muscles have been divided, the fleshy fibres of the supinator are to be followed forwards to their insertion into the radius ; and that part of the origin of the flexor profundus digitorum, which lies on the outer side of the insertion of the brachialis anticus, is to be removed. The supinator brevis (d) surrounds the upper part. of the radius, except at the tuberosity and the front of the bone below it. It arises from the external margin of the ulna for a distance of two inches, as well as from a depression below the small sigmoid cavity ; also from the orbicular ligament of the radius and the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. The fibres pass outwards and forwards, and are inserted into the upper third or more of the radius, except at the fore and inner parts, reaching downwards to the insertion of the pronator teres, and forwards to the oblique line of the bone. The supinator brevis is concealed altogether at the posterior and external aspects of the limb by the muscles of the superficial layer; and anteriorly the radial vessels and nerve lie over it. The lower border is contiguous to the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, only the pos- terior interosseous vessels (a) intervening. Through the substance of the muscle the posterior interosseous nerve (3) winds to the back of the limb. Action. "When the radius has been moved over the ulna in pronation, the short supinator comes into play to bring that bone again to the outer side of the ubia. The posterior interosseous artert (fig. 92, a)is an offset from the common interosseous trunk (p. 291), and reaches the back of the foreami above the membrane between the bones. Appealing between the contiguous borders of the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the artery descends at first between the superficial and deep layers of muscles ; and afterwards, with a superficial position in the lower third of the forearm, along the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris as far as the wrist, where it Interosseous recurrent, c.

Much reduced in size at that spot, it muscles; sinks beneath the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, and runs on the interosseous membrane to the back of the carpus.

The radial artery (d), Radial with its venae comites, winds below the radius to the back of the ^isi:^ carpus, and enters the palm of the hand at the first interosseous space, between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. At first the vessel lies deeply on the external lateral ligament of the relations to wrist-joint, and beneath the tendons of the extensors of the meta- l^na carpal bone (e) and first phalanx of the tbivmb (f) ; but afterwards it is more superficial, and is crossed by the tendon of the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb (g).

The hones are hut slightly bound together hy ligamentous hands, Looseness, for, on the removal of the muscles, the head of the humerus may he drawn from the scapula for the distance of an inch. The capsular ligament (fig. 79,5) encloses the articular portions of Capsular the bones. It is much thickened above, and slightly so below ; and ligament: the surrounding tendons are closely adherent to it. By the one end it is fixed around the articular surface of the attach- scapula, where it is connected with the long head, of the triceps. By the other the ligament is fixed (fig. 93) to the neck of the humerus close to the articular surface above, but at a little distance down the bone below ; and its attachment is interrupted, between the tuber- osities (b) by the tendon of the biceps muscle, over which it is con- tinued, covering in the bicipital groove (fig. 79). On the inner side there is an aperture in the capsule, below the coracoid process, aperture; through which the synovial membrane of the joint is continuous with the bursa beneath the tendon of the subscapularis. The following muscles surround the articulation ;—above and be- muscles hind are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor ; below ' are the long head of the triceps and the lower part of the subscapu- laris ; and internally it is covered by the last-named muscle. On the upper part of the capsule is a thick band of fibres—the accessory coraco-humeral or accessory ligament (fig. 79, which springs from the outer side of the coracoid process of the scapula, and widening over the top of the joint, is attached to the margins of the bicipital groove, and to the tuberosities. Dissection. To see the interior of the articulation cut circularly Dissection through the capsule near the scapula. When this has been done, s^uctoS! the attachment of the capsule to the hones, the glenoid ligament, and the tendon of the biceps will be manifest. The tendon of the biceps muscle arches over the head of the humerus, Tendon of and serves the purpose of a ligament in supporting the bone. It is the biucl's- attached to the upper part of the head of the scapula (fig. 93, d), and is united on each side with the glenoid ligament. At first flat, it afterwards becomes round, aud enters the groove between the tuberosities of the humerus, where it is surrounded by the synovial membrane. The glenoid ligament (fig. 93, c) is a fibrous band, which surrounds Glenoid the fossa of the same name, increasing it for the reception of the life'!Uneut- head of the humerus. It is about two lines in width, and is con- nected in part with the sides of the tendon of the biceps ; but most of its fibres are fixed separately to the margin of the glenoid fossa. The synovial membrane lines the articular surface of the capsule, Synovial and is continued through the aperture on the inner side to join the mcmbr»ne. bursa beneath the subscapular muscle. The membrane is reflected around the tendon of the biceps, and lines the upper part of the bicipital groove of the humerus.DISSECTION OP UPrER LIMB. 316 Surface of humerus; of scapula. Kinds of movement. Flexion ami Articular surfaces (fig. 93). The convex articular head of the humerus is three or four times as large as the hollow of the scapula, and forms rather less than the half of a sphere. The head of the hone is supported on a short neck, which is joined to the shaft at an ohtuse angle. The glenoid fossa of the scapida is ovoidal in form with the larger end down, and is very shallow. Its margin is slightly more promi- nent "below than ahove. Movements. In this joint there is the common angular motion in four directions, with the circular or circumductory; and in addition a movement of rotation. In the swinging to and fro movement, the carrying forwards and Fig. 93.* extension are accom- panied by rotation of scapula. Condition of head of humerus. Checks to movements. inwards of the humerus constitutes flexion; and the moving it backwards and outwards, extension. Flexion is freer than extension; and as the joint is bent the scapula follows the humerus, undergoing a rotation upwards, so that the whole range of movement of the aim in this direction is much greater than that taking place in the scapulo-humeral articulation. In extension the scapula is similarly rotated downwards, the lower angle approaching the spine. During these movements the head of the humerus rests in the bottom of the glenoid fossa, rotating around an axis that is nearly perpendicular to the plane of that cavity ; and there is no tendency to dislocation either from the rapidity or extent of the movement. Flexion of the humerus upon the scapula is checked by the twisting of the capsule, and by the meeting of the small tuberosity of the former bone with the coraco-acromial arch. Extension is limited mainly by the coraco-humeral ligament. Abduction and adduction. In abduction,, the arm is moved out- * "View of the interior of the shoulder-joint, a.

These movements, like the fore- going, are accompanied, and their range is increased by rotation of the scapula. When the limb is abducted, the head of the humerus glides Abduction, downwards in the glenoid cavity, and projects beyond it against the lower part of the capsule, which is stretched ; while the great tuberosity sinks beneath the acromial arch, which sets a limit to the movement. In this condition a little more movement down of the head, either by muscles depressing it or by force elevating the farther end of the bone, will throw it out of place, giving rise to dislocation. In adduction, the head of the humerus rises in the socket, and Adduction, the coraco-humeral ligament being tightened checks the movement. In circumduction, the humerus passes in succession through the Circum- four different states above mentioned, and the limb describes a cone, the apex of which is at the shoulder and the base at the digits. Rotation. There are two kinds of rotatory movement, viz., in and Rotation: out; and in each the humerus revolves around an axis passing from the centre of the head through the shaft to the lower end of the bone. In rotation in, the great tuberosity moves forwards and inwards, iu, and the head of the bone rolls backwards in the glenoid cavity, and the hinder part of the capsule is rendered tense. In rotation out, the out. movements of the parts of the humerus are reversed, and the front of the capsule is stretched. The movements are stopped by the tightening of the capsule, assisted by the muscles on the back and front of the joint respectively. Dissection. To make the necessary dissection of the ligaments of Dissection the elbow, the brachialis anticus must be taken away from the j^hJt elbow" front, and the triceps from the back of the joint. The muscles con- nected with the outer and inner condyles of the humerus, as well as the supinator brevis and the flexor profundus digitorum, are to be removed. With a little cleaning the four ligaments—anterior, posterior, and two lateral—will come into view. The interosseous membrane between the bones of the forearm will be prepared by the removal of the muscles on both surfaces. The Elbow-Joint (fig. 94). In this articulation the lower end Bones of the humerus is received into the hollow of the ulna, so as to ei™«"foult. produce a hinge-like arrangement; and the upper end of the radius assists to form the outer part of the joint. Where the bones touch, the surfaces are covered with cartilage ; and they are united by the following ligaments :— The external lateral ligament is a roundish fasciculus, which is External attached by one end to a depression below the outer condyle of the lament, humerus, and by the other to the orbicular ligament round the head of the radius. A few of the posterior fibres pass backwards to the external margin of the olecranon. The internal lateral ligament is triangular in shape.

The fibres diverge, and are inserted in this way :—The anterior, which arc the strongest, are fixed to the edge of the coro- noid process; the posterior are attached to the side of the olecranon; and a few middle fibres join a transverse band over the notch between the olecranon and the coronoid process. The ulnar nerve is in contact with the ligament; and vessels enter Fig. 94.* the joint by the aperture beneath the transverse band. The anterior ligament is thin, and its fibres are separated by intervals in which masses of fat are lodged. By its upper edge the ligament is at- tached to the front of the humerus, and by its lower to the front of the coronoid process and the orbicular ligament. The brachialis anticus muscle coders it. The posterior ligament is much thinner and looser than the anterior, and is covered com- pletely by the triceps muscle. Superiorly it is attached to the humerus above the fossa for the olecranon ; and inferiorly it is inserted into the olecranon. Some few fibres are transverse be- tween the margins of the fossa before mentioned. Dissection. Open the joint by an incision across the front near the humerus, and disarticulate the bones, in order that the articular surfaces may be seen. The synovial membrane of the joint passes from one bone to another along the deep surface of the connecting ligaments. It is continued downwards on the inner surface of the orbicular ligament, and serves for the joint of the head of the radius with the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Articular surfaces. The articular surface of the lower end of the humerus is divided into two parts for the bones of the forearm. That for the radius, on the outer side, forms a rounded eminence (capitellum) which is con- fined to the front of the bone. The surface hi contact with the ulna (trochlea) is limited internally and externally by a promi- nence and hollowed out in the centre. On the front of the humerus above the articular surface are two depressions which re- ceive the coronoid process and the head of the radius during flexion of the joint; and on the posterior aspect is a large fossa for the recep- tion of the olecranon in extension of the joint. On the end of the ulna the articular surface of the great sigmoid cavity is nan-owed in the centre, but expanded above and below (fig. 95). A median ridge, which is received into the hollow of the trochlea, extends from the upper to the lower end of the fossa ; and * The ligaments of the elbow-joint, and of the radius and ulna (Bourgcry.) 1 Capsule" of the elbow-joint. 2.

This joint is like a hinge in its movements, permitting only flexion and extension. In flexion, the bones of the forearm move forwards, each on its own articular surface, so as leave the back of the humerus un- covered. The movement is checked by the meeting of the arm and forearm ; and the posterior and internal lateral ligaments are stretched. In extension, the ulna and radius are carried back over the articular extending, surface of the humerus until they come into a line with the arm- Fig- 95-* bone. This movement is checked by the anterior ligament, and the muscles on the front of the joint. TJhion of the Eadius and Ulna. The radius is connected with the ulna "at both ends by means of synovial joints, -with siirrounding ligaments; and the shafts of the bones are united by interosseous ligaments. Upper radioulnar articu- lation. In this joint the head of the radius is received into the small sigmoid cavity of the idna, and is kept in place by the fol- lowing ligamentous band:— The annular or orbicular ligament (fig. 95, a) is about one-third of an inch -wide, and is stronger behind than before ; it is placed around the prominence of the head of the radius, and is attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Its upper border, the thicker, is connected -with the ligaments of the elbow-joint; but the lower is free, and is applied around the neck of the radius. In the socket formed by this ligament and the cavity of the ulna the radius moves freely. The synovial membrane is a prolongation of that hning the elbow- joint ; it projects inferiorly between the neck of the radius and the lower margin of the anmdar ligament. Ligaments of the shafts of the bones. The aponeurotic stratum connecting together the bones in nearly their whole length consists of the two following parts :— The interosseous membrane (fig. 94,3) is a thin fibrous layer, which is attached to the contiguous margins of the radius and ulna, and forms an incomplete septum between the muscles on the front at the upper eud by orbicular ligament around the head of the bone; synovial membrane.

Bones form- ing wrist- joint united by and back of the forearm. Most of its fibres are directed oblkpiely downwards and inwards, though a few on the posterior surface have an opposite direction. Superiorly the membrane is wanting for a considerable space, and through the interval the posterior inter- osseous vessels pass backwards. Some small apertures exist in it for the passage of vessels ; and the largest of these (4) is about two inches from the lower end, through which the anterior interosseous artery turns to the back of the wrist. The membrane gives attachment to the deep muscles. The oblique ligament (fig. 94,2) is a slender band above the inter- osseous membrane, the fibres of which have a direction opposite to those of the membrane. By one end it is fixed to the lower end of the corouoid process, and by the other to the radius below the tuberosity. The ligament divides into two the space above the in- terosseous membrane. Oftentimes this band is not to be recognised. The lower radio-ulnar articulation cannot be well s-een till after the examination of the wrist-joint (p. 322). Movement of the radius. The radius moves forwards and back- wards around the ulna. The forward motion, directing the pahnj of the hand backwards, is called pronation ; and the backward movement, by which the palm of the hand is turned to the front, is named supination. In pronation, the upper end of the bone rotates within the band of the orbicular ligament without shifting its position to the ulna. The lower end, on the contrary, moves over the ulna from the outer to the inner side, describing nearly half a circle ; and the shaft crosses oblicpiely that of the ulna. In supination, the lower end of the radius turns backwards over the ulna; the shafts come to be placed side by side, the radius being external; and the upper end rotates from within out in its circular band. In these movements the radius revolves round a line, internal to the shaft, which is prolonged upwards through the neck and head of the bone, and downwards through the styloid process of the ulna. The upper end of the bone is kept in place by the orbicular liga- ment ; the lower end by the triangular fibro-cartilage; and the shafts are united by the interosseous ligament, which is tightened in supi- nation, and relaxed in pronation. In fracture of either bone the movements cease ; in the one case because the radius cannot be moved unless it is entire ; and in the other because the broken ulna cannot support the revolving radius. Dissection. To see the ligaments of the wrist-joint, the tendons and the annular ligaments must be removed from both the front and back ; and the fibrous structures and the small vessels should be taken from the surface of the ligaments. The "Wrist-Joint (fig. 96). The lower end of the radius, and the first row of the carpal bones, except the pisiform, enter into the wrist-joint. Four ligaments connect the bones, viz., anterior and posterior, and two lateral. The ulna is shut out from this articula- tion by means of a piece of fibro-cartilage.321 THE WRIST-JOINT. external lateral, internal lateral, posterior ligament.*. The external lateral ligament is a short band, which passes from the styloid process of the radius to the outer part of the scaphoid bone. The internal lateral ligament is longer and thicker than the external. It is attached by one end to the styloid process of the ulna, and by the other to the rough upper part of the pyramidal bone. Some of the anterior , fibres are continued to the lg" pisiform bone. The anterior ligament (fig. 96,') springs from the radius, and is inserted into the first row of carpal bones, except the pisiform, on the anterior surface. The posterior ligament (fig. 99,1) is membranous, like the anterior, and its fibres are directed downwards and in- wards from the radius to the same three carpal bones of the first row on the posterior aspect. Dissection. To see the form of the articular surfaces, the joint may be opened by a transverse incision through the posterior ligament, near the bones of the carpus. Articular surfaces. The end of the radius, and the fibro-cartilage (fig. 97, c) uniting it with the ulna form a shallow socket for the reception of the carpal bones; and the surface of the radius is divided by a prominent line into an external triangular, and an internal square impression. The three caipal bones of the first row constitute a convex eminence (fig. 98), which is received into the hollow before mentioned in this way;—the scaphoid bone (a) is opposite the external mark of the radius ; the semilunar bone (6) touches the scpiare impression and the triangular fibro-cartilage ; while the pyramidal bone (c) is in contact with the capsule, and with the fibro-cartilage when the hand is moved inwards. The synovial membrane has the arrangement common to simple joints. This joint communicates occasionally with the lower radio- ulnar articulation by means of an aperture in the fibro-cartilage between the two. Movements. The wrist is a condyloid articulation, and permits of angular motion in four different directions, with circumduction. Flexion and extension.

In extension the hand is carried backwards, and the row of carpal bones moves in the opposite direction, viz., from behind forwards, so as to cause the anterior ligament to be tightened. The backward movement is not so free as the forward. Abduction and adduction. The hand is carried transversely out- wards in the former, and inwards in the latter movement; and the extent of movement is greater towards the ulnar than the radial side. The lateral bgaments are put on the stretch, the inner in abduction and the outer in adduction ; and the motion is limited on the outer side by the meeting of the styloid process of the radius with the scaphoid bone. Circumduction. The hand describes a cone in this movement, the apex being at the wrist and the base at the digits ; and it moves more freely in extension and adduction than in the opposite directions. Lower radioulnar articulation. In this articulation the head of the ulna is received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius ; —an arrangement just the opposite to that between the upper ends of the bones. The chief bond of union between the bones is a strong fibro- cartilage; but a kind of capsule, consisting of scattered fibres, surrounds loosely the end of the ulna. The triangular fibro-cartilage (fig. 97, c) is placed transversely below the end of the ulna, and is thickest at its margins and apex. By its base the cartilage is fixed to the ridge which separates the carpal from the ulnar articulating surface of the radius ; and by its apex to the styloid process of the ulna, and the depression at the root of that projec- tion. Its margins are united with the contiguous anterior and posterior liga- ments of the wrist-joint; and its sur- faces enter into different joints, viz., the wrist, and the lower radio-ulnar. It serves to unite the radius and ulna, and to form part of the socket for the carpal bones. Occasionally it is perforated by an aperture. The synovial membrane is very loose, and ascends between the radius and the idna : it is separated from that of the wrist-joint by the triangular fibro-cartilage. The motion in this articulation is referred to with the movements of the radius (p. 320). Union of the Carpal Bones. The several bones of the corpus (except the pisiform) are united into two rows by small dorsal, palmar, and interosseous bands; and the two rows are connected together by wide separate ligaments. * Lower ends of the forearm bones with the uniting fibro-cartilage. a.

The articulations of the carpal bones with each other will he prepared by taking away all the tendons from the hand, and cleaning carefully the connecting ligamentous hands. Two distinct ligaments from the pisiform bone to the unciform and fifth meta- carpal are to be defined in the palm. At the same time the ligamentous bands imiting the metacarpal with the carpal bones, and with one another should be dissected. Banes of the first row (fig. 98). The semilunar bone is united to the scaphoid and pyramidal by dorsal (d) and palmar transverse bands ; as well as by small interosseous ligaments at the upper part of the contiguous surfaces. The pisiform bone is articulated to the front of the pyramidal by a distinct capsule and synovial sac. It has farther two special ligaments ; one of these is attached to the process of the unciform, and the other to the base of the fifth metacarpal bone. The bones of the second row (fig. 98) are connected together in the same way as those of the first, viz., by a dorsal (€) and a palmar band of fibres from one bone to another. Between FlS- 98-* the contiguous rough sur- faces of the several bones are interosseous ligaments, one in each interval. Movement. Only a small degree of ghduag motion is permitted between the different carpal bones, in consequence of the flat- tened articidar surfaces, and the short ligaments uniting one to another; and this is less in the se- cond than in the first rowr. One row with another (transverse carpal joint; fig. 98). The two rows of carpal bones are connected by an anterior and posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The anterior ligament (p) consists of strong fibres, which for the most part converge from the three bones of the first row to the os magnum. The posterior ligament is thinner and looser ; and its strongest fibres are transverse. Of the lateral ligaments the external (k) is the better marked, and t extends between os trapezium and scaphoid bone ; the internal (I) passes from the pyramidal to the unciform bone.

After the division of the lateral and posterior ligaments, the one row of bones may be separated far enough from the other to allow the articular surfaces to be seen. Articular surfaces. The three bones of the first row, viz., scaphoid («), semilunar (6), and pyramidal (c), together form an arch with its concavity turned downwards, while externally the scaphoid presents a convexity to the second row. The lower articular sur- face has a corresponding form, the os magnum and unciform making up a condyloid projection which is received into the arch of the first row, and the trapezium and trapezoid forming a slight hollow for the convexity of the scaphoid bone. One synovial sac serves for the articulation of all the carpal bones, except the pisiform Avith the pyramidal. The cavity extends trans- versely between the two rows of the carpus, and is continued upwards and downwards between the individual bones. The offsets upwards are two, and they sometimes open into the cavity of the wrist-joint; but the offsets in the opposite direction are three, and may be continued to all, or only to some of the articulations 1 letween the four inner metacarpal with their carpal bones. Movements. Owing to the irregular shape of the articular surfaces, only forward and backward movements are permitted in the trans- verse carpal joint. Flexion. As the hand is brought forwards the lower row of carpal bones moves backwards, and the posterior ligament is tightened. This motion is brought into play in full bending of the wrist. Extension. The backward movement is freer than flexion. As the lower carpal row moves towards the palm, its progress is checked by the anterior ligament of the joint, and by the strong flexor tendons. Union op the Metacarpal Bones. The metacarpal bones of the four fingers are connected at their bases by the following liga- ments :—A dorsal (fig. 99) and palmar (fig. 96) fasciculus of fibres passes transversely from each bone to the next; and the bands in the palm are the strongest. Besides these, there is a short interosse- ous ligament between the contiguous rough surfaces of the bones. Where the metacarpal bones touch they are covered by cartilage ; and between the articular surfaces there are prolongations of the synovial cavity serving for their articulation with the carpus. At their distal ends the same four metacarpal bones are connected by the transverse ligament, which was seen in the dissection of the hand (p. 304). Union of the Metacarpal and Carpal Bones. The meta- carpal bones of the fingers are articulated with the carpal bones after one plan ; but the bone of the thumb has a separate joint. The metacarpal bone of the thumb articulates with the trapezium ; and the ends of the bones are encased in a capsular ligament (fig. 96,2), which is lined by a simple synovial membrane. The thumb-joint possesses angular movement in opposite direc- tions, with opposition and circumduction, thus :— Flexion and extmsion. When the joint is flexed, the metacarpal325 CARPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. Lone is Lrought in front of the palm; and as the movement proceeds, the thumb is gradually turned towards the fingers, passing mto the state of opposition. In this way the thumb may be made to touch opposi- te palmar surface of any or all of the fingers, the phalanges of the latter being somewhat bent at the same time.

The palmar ligaments (fig. 96), usually one to each metacarpal bone, are weaker and less constant than the dorsal. These liga- ments may be oblique in direction ; and sometimes a band is divided between two, as in the case of a ligament passing from the trapezium to the second and third metacarpals. One or more may be wanting. On the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone of the middle digit is lateral band, a longitudinal lateral band, which is attached above to the os mag- num and unciform, and below to a rough part on the inner side of the Lase of the ahove mentioned Lone.

The articular surfaces of the hones in the carpo-meta- carpal articulation may he seen by cutting through the rest of the ligaments on the posterior aspect of the hand. Articular surfaces. The metacarpal hone of the fore finger presents a hollowed articular surface, which receives the prominence of the trapezoid hone, and articulates laterally with the trapezium and os magnum. The middle finger metacarpal articulates with the os magnum. The metacarpal bone of the ring finger touches the unciform bone and the os magnivm. And the little finger bone is opposed to the unciform. Synovial sacs. Usually two synovial sacs are interposed between the carpal and metacarpal bones, viz., a separate one for the bone of the thumb, and offsets of the common carpal synovial sac (p. 324) for the others. Sometimes there is a distinct synovial sac for the articulation of the two inner metacarpals with the unciform bone. Interosseous ligaments. The interosseous ligaments between the bases of the metacarpal bones may be demonstrated by detaching one bone from another ; and those uniting the adjacent carpal bones may be shown in the same way. Dissection. For the examination of the joint between the head of the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the finger, it will be recpusite to clear away the tendons and the tendinous expansion around it. A lateral ligament on each side, and an anterior thick band are to be defined. One of the joints may be opened to see the articular surfaces. The same dissection may be made for the articulations between the phalanges of the fingers. Union of Metacarpal Bone and First Phalanx (fig. 100). In this joint the convex head of the metacarpal bone is received into the glenoid fossa of the phalanx, and the two are united by the following ligaments :— The lateral ligament (a) is the same on both sides of the joint. Each is triangular in form ; it is attached above to the lower part of the tubercle on the side of the head of the metacarpal bone, and below it is inserted into the phalanx and the anterior ligament. The anterior ligament (b) is a strong and dense band, which is fixed firmly to the phalanx, but loosely to the metacarpal bone. It is grooved for the flexor tendon ; and to its sides the lateral liga- ments are united. On the dorsal aspect of the joint, the capsule is completed by a thin layer of connective tissue which supports the synovial mem- brane, and is closely covered by the extensor tendon. The synovial membrane of the joint is a simple sac. In the articulation of the thumb two sesamoid bones are coimected with the anterior ligament, and receive most of the fibres of the lateral ligaments. Movements. Motion hi four opposite directions, together with circumduction, take place in these condyloid joints.327 JOINTS OF PHALANGES. Fig. 100. Flexion and extension. In flexion, the phalanx glides forwards over the head of the metacarpal bone, and leaves this exposed to form the knuckle when the finger is shut. The lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon are put on the stretch as the joint is bent. In extension, the phalanx moves backwards to slightly beyond the line of the meta- carpal bone, so that the two form an obtuse angle. The anterior ligament and the flexor tendons are stretched, and limit the movement. Abduttion and adduction are the lateral movements of the finger from or towards the middle line of the hand. The lateral ligament of the side of the joint which is rendered convex is tightened, and the other is relaxed. The circumductory motion is less impeded in the fore and little fingers than in the others. In the joint of the thumb the move- ments, especially to the side, are much less extensive than in the fingers. Union of the Phalanges. The ligaments of these joints are similar to those in the metacarpophalangeal articidation, viz., two lateral and an anterior. The lateral ligaments are triangular in form Each is connected by its apex to the proximal phalanx at the side of the head ; and by its base to the distal phalanx and the anterior ligament. The anterior ligament has the same mode of attachment between the extremities of the bones as in the metacarpophalangeal joint, but it is not so strong. There is a simple synovial memlwane.present in the joint. The joint of the second with the last £>halanx is like the preced- ing in the number and disposition of its ligaments ; but all the articular bands are much less strongly marked. Articular surfaces. The head of each phalanx is marked by a pulley-like surface. The base presents a hollow on each side of a median ridge, which fits into the central depression of the opposed articular surface. Movements. The two inteqmalangeal joints can be bent and straightened like a hinge. Flexion and extension. In flexion, the distal phalanx moves round the proximal in each joint, and the motion is checked by the lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon : in the joint between the middle and the metacarpal phalanx this movement is most extensive. In extension the farther phalanx comes into a line with the nearer one, and the motion is stopped by the anterior ligament and the flexor tendons. bending; extending; lateral motion; circumduc- tory.

Dissection to open thorax. Sternum to be kept. Form in general; on a cross section. Boundaries. The cavity of the thorax is the space included by the spinal column, the sternum, and ribs, and by certain muscles in the intervals of the bony framework. In it the organs of respiration, and the heart with its great vessels are lodged ; and through it the gullet, and some vessels and nerves are transmitted. Dissection. Supposing the soft parts covering in front the bony parietes of the thorax to have been examined and taken away, the cavity is to be opened by removing a portion of the anterior boun- dary. To make a sufficient opening in the thorax, the sternum is to be sawn through opposite the interval between the first two ribs, and again between the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs. After detaching the lining membrane (pleura) from the inner surface of the chest-wall, the student is to cut through the true ribs, except the first and seventh,* as far back as he can conveniently reach. The loose sternum and the ribs can be removed by dividing the internal mammary vessels, the triangularis sterni, and the inter- costal muscles in the first and sixth spaces. The bag of the plem'a, and the cavity with its contents will be now ready for examination. The sternum and the cartilages of the ribs will be required here- after for the dissection of the ligaments. Form. The included cavity is irregularly conical, with the apex above and the base below ; and it appears, from the collapsed state of the lungs, to be only partly filled by the contained viscera, but during life the whole of the now vacant space is occupied by the expanded lungs. On a horizontal section its shape would appear broadly cordiform ; for the cavity is flattened on the sides, is diminished in the middle line by the prominent spinal column, and is projected backwards on each side of the spine. Boundaries. On the sides are the ribs with the intercostal muscles; in front is the sternum ; and behind is the spine. * The student must leave these ribs uncut ; the division of them will not lie advantageous to him, and will injure the dissection of the neck and abdomen.331 BOUNDARIES AND SIZE. The base is constructed at the circumference by the last dorsal The base, vertebra behind, by the end of the sternum in front, and by the ribs with their cartilages on each side ; while the space included by the bones is closed by the diaphragm. The base is wider transversely than from before back, and is ^ convex towards the chest; though at certain spots it projects more than at others. Thus in the centre it is slightly lower than on each side, and is on a level with the base of the ensiform process. On the right side it rises to a level with the upper border of the fifth and height: rib near the sternum ; and on the left, to the corresponding part of the upper border of the sixth rib.* From the lateral projections, the diaphragm slopes suddenly towards its attachment to the ribs, but more behind than before, so as to leave an angular interval between it and the wall of the chest. The level of this attached ^JM*18 edge will be marked by an oblique line, over the side of the chest, from the base of the ensiform process to the eleventh dorsal spine; but it differs slightly on the two sides, being rather lower on the left. The apex of the space is continued higher than the osseous boun- Apex dary, and reaches into the root of the neck. Its highest point is J^f^es into not in the middle line, for there the windpipe, blood-vessels, &c, lie ; but is prolonged on each side for one or two inches above the anterior end of the first rib, so that the apex may be said to be bifid, is bifid. Each point projects between the scaleni muscles, and under the how subclavian blood-vessels; and in the interval between them lie the bounded, several objects passing between the neck and the thorax. Dimensions. The extent of the thoracic cavity does not corre- Exterior size spond with the apparent size externally; for a part of the space in- ™^*at of eluded by the ribs below is occupied by the abdominal viscera; and the cavity reaches upwards, as just stated, into the neck. In consequence of the arched condition of the diaphragm, the Depth depth of the space varies greatly at different parts. At the centre, varies: where the depth is least, it measures generally from six to seven °re' inches, but at the back about half as much again; and the other beWnd ; vertical measurements can be estimated by means of the data given °n Sldes' of the level of the base on the wall of the thorax. Alterations in capacity. The size of the thoracic cavity is con- size is stantly varying during life with the condition of the ribs and dia- $eefcd'" phragm in breathing. The horizontal measurements are increased in inspiration, when transversei the ribs are raised and separated from one another, and are dimi- J^^or" nished in expiration as the ribs approach and the sternum sinks. ribs; An alteration in depth is due to the condition of the diaphragm in depth by in respiration ; for the muscle descends when air is taken into the diallhraSin' lungs, thus increasing the cavity ; and it ascends when the air is ex- pelled from those organs, so as to restore the previous size of the space, or to diminish it in violent efforts. But the movement of the but un- equally. * This is the height in the dead body. The level to which it may reach in great respiratory efforts during life will be stated with the account of the Diaphragm (p. 525).DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 332 Thorax lessened, how. diaphragm is not equal throughout, and some parts of the cavity will be increased more than others. For instance, the central ten- dinous piece, which is joined to the heart-case, moves but slightly ; but the lateral, bulging parts descend freely, and increase greatly the capacity of each half of the chest below by their separation from the thoracic parietes. The thoracic cavity may be diminished by the diaphragm being pushed upwards by enlargement, either temporary or permanent, of the viscera in the abdomen ; or by the existence of fluid in the latter cavity. THE PLEURAE. Sac of the pleura: form ; outer sur- face ; inner sur- face ; disposition. Difference in sac of right, and of left side. The con- tinuity is here traced from wall of chest to lung: in upper part diffe- rent. Along middle the sacs form a septum. The pleurae are two serous membranes, or closed sacs, which are reflected around the lungs in the cavity of the thorax. One occu- pies the right, and the other the left half of the cavity; they ap- proach each other along the middle of the chest, forming a thoracic partition or mediastinum. Each pleura is conical in shape ; its apex projects into the neck above the first rib (fig. 101); and its base is in contact with the dia- phragm. The outer surface is rough, and is connected to the lung and the wall of the thorax by areolar tissue ; but the inner surface is smooth and free. Surrounding the lung, and lining the interior of one half of the chest, the serous membrane consists of a parietal part—costal pleura, and of a visceral part—pulmonary pleura. There are some differences in the shape and extent of the two pleural bags. On the right side the bag is wider and shorter than on the left; and on the latter it is narrowed by the projection of the heart to that side. The continuity of the bag of the pleura may be traced horizontally from a given point, over the lung and the wall, back to the same spot in the following manner:—Supposing the membrane to be followed outwards from the sternum, it lines the wall of the chest as far as the spinal column ; here it is directed forwards to the root of the lung, and is then reflected over the viscus, covering its surface, and extending into the fissures between the lobes. From the front of the root the pleura may be followed over the side of the pericar- dium to the sternum. Below the root the pleura forms a thin fold, the ligamentum latum -pulmonis, which intervenes between the inner surface of the lung and the side of the pericardium. If the serous sac be traced above the root of the lung, it describes two distinct circles, one lining the chest-wall, and the other surround- ing the lung. The mediastinum. The median thoracic partition, ormediasl in urn, is formed by the inner portion of the parietal pleura on each side, and the structures interposed between the two membranes. It extends the whole depth of the thorax, and reaches from the spine to the sternum, thus separating the right and left pleural cavities. In the centre the two layers of serous membrane are widely separated by the heart; but in front and behind they come nearerTHE MEDIASTINUM. 333 together. The partition is artificially divided into four parts, wliich are distinguished as the superior, anterior, middle, and posterior mediastina. The superior mediastinum is the portion of the septum above the Superior pericardium, and may be defined as bounded below by a plane ™numV extending from the lower border of the body of the fourth dorsal boun<iarjeS( vertebra to the junction of the manubrium and body of the sternum. It is limited in front by the manubrium with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and behind by the upper four dorsal vertebrae and the lower ends of the longi colli muscles. Between the pleurae in tbis part there are foimd, proceeding from *°jjtents before backwards, the following objects,—the remains of the thymus gland, several lymphatic glands, the innominate veins and the upper half of the superior cava, the phrenic and pneumo-gastric nerves, the transverse part of the arch of the aorta with its three large branches, innominate, left carotid and left subclavian, the tracbea, oesophagus and thoracic duct, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Below the latter spot the left pleura inclines away from the middle line, and is separated from its fellow by an interval in which the pericardium comes into contact with the sternum and the left triangularis sterni muscle. The anterior mediastinum contents. contains only some areolar tissue with a few small lymphatic glands. In sdme bodies the left pleura is continued behind the sternum nearly as far as the diaphragm.

The thymus gland is an organ which is most developed in the infant, and the use of which is not understood. It is placed mainly in the upper part of the thorax ; and it may be best examined in a full-grown foetus. At birth it is about two inches in length, and of a greyish colour. It consists of two lobes of a conical form, which touch each other. Its upper end is pointed, and extends on the trachea as high as the thyroid body ; and the lower wider part reaches as far as the fourth rib. In the thorax it rests on the aortic arch and branches, on the left innominate vein, and on the pericardium In the adult all that remains of the thymus is a brownish rather firm material in the interpleural space behind the upper end of the sternum; and after middle life it has generally disappeared altogether. large RELATIONS OF THE LUNGS. Number and use. Form and parts. Base touches diaphragm shape and level. Apex is in the neck. Anterior edge is thin position on right, and left side. ' Posterior edge is thick The lungs are two in number, and are contained in the cavity of the thorax, one on each side of the spinal column. In these organs the blood is changed in respiration. Each lung is of a somewhat conical form, and takes its shape from the space in which it is lodged. It is unattached, except at the inner side where the vessels enter forming the root; and it is covered by the bag of the pleura. It has a base aud apex, two borders and two surfaces ; and one or two fissures divide it into lobes. The base of the lung is hollowed in the centre and thin at the circumference, fitting the convexity of the diaphragm. Follow- ing the shape of that muscle, it is sloped oblic|iiely from before backwards, and reaches in consequence much lower behind than in front. Its position with respect to the wall of the thorax may be indicated by a line drawn from the sixth chondro-sternal articulation to the tenth dorsal spine ; but it will be slightly lower in front on the left, than on the right side (fig. 101). The apex is rounded, and projects from one to two inches above the anterior end of the first rib where it lies beneath the clavicle, the anterior scalenus muscle, and the subclavian artery. The anterior border is thin, and overlies in part the peri- cardium. On the right side it lies along the middle of the sternum as low as the sixth costal cartilage (fig. 101). On the left side it reaches the mid-line of the chest as low as the fourth costal carti- lage ; but below that spot it presents a V-shaped notch (fig. 101), the apex of which is opposite the outer part of the cartilage of the fifth rib. The posterior border is half as long again as the anterior, and projects inferiorly between the lower ribs and the diaphragm ; it is thick and vertical, and is received into the hollow by the side of the spinal column.335 RELATIONS OF LUNGS.

Occasionally there may be a trace of the thud lobe in the left lung. Besides the difference in the number of the lobes, the right lung Difference is larger and heavier, and is wider and more hollowed out at the s?ze°oftlien base, as well as being somewhat shorter than the left. The increased lungs- length and the narrowness of the left lung are due to the absence of a large projecting body like the liver below it, and to the direction of the heart to the left side. * Diagram to show the difference in the anterior border of the right and left lung, the edge being indicated by the dark line : and to mark the different level of the base on the two sides.336 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Koot of the lung : situation ; relations. Consti- tuents of the root ; their rela- tive posi- tions. The root of the lung consists of the vessels entering the fissure'on the inner surface ; and as these are hound together hy the pleura and some areolar tissue they form a stalk, which attaches the lung to the heart and the windpipe. The root is situate at the inner surface, about midway between the base and apex, and about a third of the breadth from the posterior border of the lung. In front of the root on both sides are the phrenic and the anterior pulmonary nerves, the former being some little distance from it; and anterior to the right root is the descending cava. Behind on both sides is the posterior pulmonary plexus ; and on the left side there is, in addition, the descending aorta. Above, on the right side, is the azygos vein ; and on the left side, the arch of the aorta. Below each root is the fold of pleura called ligamentum latum pulmonis. In the root of the lung are collected a branch of the pulmonary artery, two pulmonary veins, and a division of the airtube (bronchus); small nutritive bronchial arteries and veins, and some nerves and lymphatics. The large vessels and the airtube have the following: positions to one another :— On both sides the bronchus is behind, the pulmonary veins in front, and the pulmonary artery in the middle. In the direction from above down the position on the right side is bronchus, pul- monary artery, and pulmonary veins ; but on the left side the bronchus and artery change places, and the order is artery, bronchus, and veins. This difference in the two sides is accounted for by the bronchus of the right side giving off its branch to the upper lobe of the lung before it is crossed by the artery ; while on the left side there is no corresponding branch of the airtube, and the artery crosses the undivided bronchial stem. Pericar- dium. Clean ves- sels of heart, First aorta, then inno- minate veins and branches, and upper cava. THE PERICARDIUM. The bag containing the heart is named the pericardium. It is situate in the middle of the thorax, in the interval between the two pleurae. Dissection. Supposing the surface of the pericardium to be already cleaned, the student should next dissect out the large vessels above the heart, and trace the nerves. The large artery curving to the left above the pericardium is the- aorta, which furnishes three trunks to the head and the upper limbs, viz., from right to left, the innominate, the left common carotid, and left subclavian. On its left side lies the larger pulmonary artery. Above the arch of the aorta a large venous trunk, left innominate, crosses over the three arteries mentioned above, and ends by uniting- on the right side with the right innominate vein in the upper cava. Several small veins, which may be mistaken for nerves, ascend over the aorta, and enter this trunk. Define the branches of this vein, and especially one crossing the aortic arch towards the left side,' which is the left superior intercostal vein (fig. 108, i). The large vein by the side of the aorta is the upper cava ; and the azygos vein will be found opening into it behind.337 THE PERICARDIUM. Seek the following nerves of the left side, which cross the arch of the aorta : The nerve most to the left, and the largest, is the arch of vagus ; the next largest in size, in front of the vagus, is theaorta- phrenic. Between the preceding nerves, and close to the artery, are the left superficial cardial nerve of the sympathetic, and the lower cervical cardiac hranch of the left vagus ; of .the two, the last is the smaller, and on the right of the other. The cardiac nerves from the left vagus and sympathetic are to he Dissect followed to a small plexus (superficial cardiac) in the concavity of jS"'?!;''1 the aorta. An offset of the plexus is to he traced downwards arch of If) I"t '1 between the pulmonary artery and the aorta towards the right' coronary artery of the heart; and another prolongation is to be found coming forwards from the deep cardiac to the superficial plexus : this dissection is difficult, and requires care. When the pericardium is afterwards opened the nerves will he followed on the heart. Oftentimes these small nerves are destroyed in injecting the body. The pericardium is somewhat conical in form, the wider part Pericar- being turned towards the diaphragm, and the narrower part extending dium " upwards beyond the heart on the large vessels. It is placed behind f0" ,a.u<l the sternum, and projects on each side of that bone, but much more position; towards the left than the right side. Laterally the pericardium is covered by the pleura, and the phrenic nerve and vessels lie between relations, the two. Its anterior surface is separated from the chest-wall by the pleurae and lungs, except over a small area on the left side corre- sponding to the lower part of the anterior mediastinum (p. 333) ; and behind, in the interval between the pleuroa, it is in contact with the oesophagus and aorta. The heart-case consists of a fibrous structure, which is lined in- Compost- ternally by a serous membrane. tlon" The fibrous part surrounds the heart, and is pierced by the large Fibrous part vessels joining that organ, with the exception of the inferior cava : ^^ths to it gives prolongations around the vessels, and the strongest of these vessels, sheaths is on the aorta. Below, it is united to the central tendon of the diaphragm. This membrane is thickest at the upper part, and is formed of fibres crossing in different directions, many being longitudinal. When the pericardium has been cut open, the serous lining will be seen. The serous sac consists of a parietal and a visceral part, which are Serous continuous with one another along the "reat vessels. The parietal 'a,yer lines 1 1 fibrous, part lines the nbrous membrane, with which it is inseparably united, and the included portion of the diaphragm ; while the visceral part covers the heart.

Extent of the heart upwards, downwards, to right, The heart is a hollow muscular organ by which the blood is propelled through the body. Into it, as the centre of the vascular system, veins enter ; and from it the arteries issue. Form. The heart is conical in form, but somewhat compressed from before backwards. The anterior surface is convex ; and the posterior or lower is nearly flat. The left border is thick and round; while the right is thin, sharp, and less firm. Size. The size of the heart varies greatly; and it is usually smaller in the woman than in the man. Its average measurements may be said to be about five inches in length, three inches and a half in width, and two and a half in thickness. Its weight is generally from ten to twelve ounces in the male, and from eight to ten in the female. Position and direction. The heart lies behind the lower two-thirds of the sternum, and projects on each side of that bone, but more to the left than the right. Its axis is directed very obliquely, from behind forwards and to the left, as well as somewhat downwards. The base is towards the spine, being opposite the sixth, seventh and eighth dorsal vertebra?, and looks backwards and upwards. The apex strikes the wall of the chest during life in the fifth inter- costal space of the left side, at the junction of the ribs with their cartilages. The anterior surface looks forwards and somewhat up- wards ; while the posterior surface is nearly horizontal, resting on the diaphragm. The right margin is turned to the front; and the left is placed farther back. In consequence of the oblique, position of the heart, the right half and the apex are directed towards the thoracic wall, though mostly with lung intervening; while the left half is undermost and deep in the cavity. Limits (fig. 102). The extent of the heart in relation to the front of the chest may be indicated as follows :—The upper limit is marked by a line across the sternum from the lower edge of the second costal cartilage of the left side to the upper edge of the third cartilage of the right side ; and the lower limit by a line, slightly convex downwards, from the seventh chondro-sternal articulation of the right side to the spot where the apex touches, the latter point being usually about one inch and a hall' below, and three-quarters of an inch to the sternal side of the nipple. On the right side thePOSITION OF HEAET. 289 heart projects about one inch and a half from the middle line of the sternum ; and on the left, the apex is distant from three to three and left, and a half inches from the centre of the breast-bone. The portion of the heart which is uncovered by lung (the area of Social superficial cardiac dulness) is included between the middle line of neart. the sternum, in its lower third, and a line drawn from the centre of Fig. 102.* the breast-bone between the fourth costal cartilages to the apex of the heart (fig. 102). Component parts. The heart is a double organ ; and in each half n^'aaIn.1'jer3 of there are two chambers, an auricle and a ventricle, which com- municate together, and are provided with vessels for the entrance and exit of the blood. The surface is marked by grooves indicating Grooves: this division.

The ventricles reach unequal distances on the two aspects of the heart ;—thus the right one forms the thin right border and most of the anterior surface; but the left enters alone into the apex, and constructs the left border, and the greater part of the posterior sur- face of the heart. Dissection. Before opening the heart, the coronary arteries are to be dissected on the surface, with the veins and small nerves thai accompany them. The two arteries appear on the sides of the pulmonary artery, and run in the grooves on the surface of the heart, -where they are surrounded by fat : one branches over the right, and the other over the left side. With each artery is a plexus of nerves, and that of the right side is to be followed upwards to the superficial cardiac plexus. In the groove between the left auricle and ventricle the student will find the large coronary vein, passing at the back into the dilated coronary sinus : the last should be defined and followed to its ending in the right auricle. The coron ary arteries are the first branches of the aorta, and supply the heart, one being distributed mainly on the right side, and the other on the left. The right artery appears on the right side of the pulmonary trunk, ami is directed backwards in the groove between the right auricle and ventricle, giving branches upwards and downwards. Two of these are larger than the rest; one runs on the anterior surface of the right A'entricle near the free margin; and the other descends in the posterior interventricular furrow to the apex of the heart. A small branch is continued to the left side of the heart, lying in the hinder part of the left auriculo-ventricular groove. The left artery passes outwards behind the pulmonary trunk to the left side of that vessel, where it divides into two branches. Of these, the anterior is the larger, and descends on the front of the heart in the groove between the two ventricles to the apex ; while the posterior runs backwards between the left auricle and ventricle. The branches of the two coronary arteries communicate on the surface of the heart, but their anastomoses are very line. The veins OP the heart (fig. 103) differ in their arrangement from the arteries, and are for the most part collected into one large trunk—the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus (fig. 103,1) will be seen on raising the heart to be placed in the sulcus between the left auricle and ventricle. About an inch usually in length, it is joined at the one end by the great cardiac vein (4) ; and at the other it opens into the right auricle. It is crossed by the muscular fibres of the left auricle, inferiorly and at its right end it receives some branches from the back of the ventricles (t), and at its left extremity another small vein ('-), the oblique vein (Marshall), which descends to it along the back of the left auricle.

It receives branches, mainly from the left side of the heart, in its course; and its ending in the sinus is marked by a ' Fig. 103.* double valve. The right coronary vein (3) is of small size, and runs in the hinder part of the right auriculo - ventricular groove to the right end of the coro- nary sinus. The posterior cardiac veins (ft) ascend on the back of the left ventricle to the coro- nary sinus ; and one larger vessel, the middle cardiac vein, lies in the posterior in- terventricular furrow. The anterior cardiac veins are tliree or four in number, and run upwards on the front of the right ventricle to open separately into the lower part of the right auricle. Smallest cardiac veins. Other small veins lie in the substance the heart, and are noticed in the description of the right auricle. Cardiac xekves. The nerves for the supply of the heart are derived from a large plexus (cardiac) beneath the arch of the aorta, from which offsets proceed to accompany the coronary arteries. The greater part of this plexus is deeply placed, and will be dissected at a later stage, hut a superficial prolongation may now be seen. The superficial cardiac plexus is placed below the arch of the aorta, Superficial to the right of the ductus arteriosus. The nerves joining it are the txus left superficial cardiac of the sympathetic, the lower cervical cardiac of the left vagus (p. 357), and a considerable bundle from the deep cardiac plexus. A small ganglion is sometimes seen in the plexus, ends in Inferiorly it sends off nerves along the right coronary artery to the "£!y.coro" heart.

The right coronary nerves pass from the superficial plexus to the right coronary artery, and receive near the heart a communicating offset from the deep cardiac plexus. The left coronary nerves are derived, as will he subsequently seen, from the deep cardiac plexus, and follow the left coronary artery. At first the nerves surround the arteries, hut they soon leave the vessels, and becoming smaller by subdivision, are lost in the muscular substance of the ventricles. On and in the substance of the heart the nerves are marked by small ganglia. The cavities of the heart may be examined in the order in which the current of the blood passes through them, viz., right auricle and ventricle, and left auricle and ventricle. Dissection. In the examination of its cavities the heart is not to be removed from the body. To open the right auricle, an incision should be made in it near the right or free border, extending from the superior cava nearly to the inferior cava ; and from the centre of this cut the knife is to be carried across the anterior wall to the appendix. By this means an opening will be made of sufficient size; and on removing the coagulated blood, and raising the flaps with hooks or pieces of string, the cavity may be examined. The cavity of the uight auricle (fig. 104) is of an irregular form,* though when seen from the right side, with the flaps held up, it has somewhat the appearance of a cone, with the base to the right and the apex to the left. The widened part or base of the cavity is turned towards the right side, and at its extremities are the openings of the superior and inferior cava?. Between those vessels the wall projects a little, and in some bodies presents a slight elevation (tubercle of Lower). The apex is prolonged downwards towards the junction of the auricle with the ventricle, and in it is the opening into the right ventricular cavity. The anterior wall is thin and loose. Near the top is an opening leading into the pouch of the appendix (7t), which will admit the tip of the little finger. Near, and in the interior of the appendix are prominent fleshy bands, named musculi pectinati, which run mostly in a transverse direction, and form a network that contrasts with the general smoothness of the auricle. The posterior wall corresponds mostly with the septum between the auricles, in consequence of the position of the heart (p. 338). On it, close to the inferior cava, is a large oval depression, the fossa ovalis (d), which is the remains of an opening between the auricles in the foetus : inferiorly it merges into the lower cava. A thin seniitransparent structure forms the bottom of the fossa ; and there is oftentimes a small oblique aperture into the left auricle at its upper part. Around the upper three-fourths of the fossa is an elevated band of muscular fibres, called annulus ovalis or isthmus * The term cavity of the auricle is sometimes confined to the part in the appendix, and the name atrium or sinus venosus is then given to the rest of the space here named auricle.EIGHT AURICLE OF HEART. 343 Fig. 10 4.* and smallest veins.

Other small apertures, named foramina smus of Tliebesius, are scattered over this surface ; some lead only into depressions ; but others are the mouths of veins of the substance of the heart (smallest cardiac veins ; p. 341). The chief apertures in the auricle are those of the two cava?, coronary sinus, and ventricle. The opening of the superior cava («) is at the top of the auricle, and looks slightly forwards. The inferior cava (b) enters the lowest part of the cavity at the back, close to the septum, and is directed inwards to the fossa ovalis (rf). The au- riculo-ventricular open- ing (c) is the largest of all, and is situate at the lower and fore part of the cavity. Between this and the septum sinus (e). All the large vessels, except the superior cava, have some kind of Valves of valve.

This fold is cava has semilunar in form, with its convex margin attached to the anterior y"i*^?lian wall of the vein, and the other free in the cavity of the auricle. The valve is wider than the vein opening; and its surfaces are directed forwards and backwards : it is often cribriform.

The placental or pure blood, entering by the inferior cava, is directed by the Eustachian valve into the left auricle, through the foramen ovale in the septum ; while the current of systemic or impure blood, coming in by the superior cava, flows downwards in front of the other to the right ventricle. T^open Dissection. To see the cavity of the right ventricle, the student ventricle. should pierce it with the scalpel below the opening from the auricle, and cut out below near the apex of the heart without injuring the ventricular septum. A flap is thus formed, like the letter V, of the anterior wall of the ventricle. In the examination of the cavity of the right ventricle, both the nap and the apex of the heart should be raised with hooks or string, so that the space may be looked into from below. Cavity of The cavity of the right ventricle (fig. 104) is triangular in t ncieVeU" f°rm) with the base turned towards the auricle of the same side. On a cross section it Avould appear semilunar in shape, the septum between the ventricles being convex towards the cavity. Apex. The apex of the cavity reaches the right border of the heart at a Base and its short distance; from the tip. The base of the ventricle is sloped, ngs. an(^ -g pei.fomteci by two apertures ; one of these, to the right and below, leading into the auricle, is the right auricido-ventricular opening (c) ; the other, on the left and much higher, is the mouth of the pulmonary artery (g). The part of the cavity leading up to the pulmonary artery is funnel-shaped, and is named infundibulum or conus arteriosus. Anterior The anterior wall, or the loose part of the ventricle, is compara- tively thin, and forms most of the anterior surface of the ventricular posterior portion of the heart. The posterior wall corresponds with the sep- waii.. tum 'between the ventricles, and is much thicker, interior of Over the greater part of the cavity the surface is marked by pro- is'uneveif- JectuiS muscular bands, the columnce camew ; but near the aperture cm it there °^ pulmonary artery the wall becomes smooth.

Into the cusps are inserted small fibrous bands—the chordae tendinere, which unite them to the muscular wall of the ventricle. The three cusps are thus placed ;—one (right) is against the anterior the cusps wall of the ventricle ; another (posterior) touches the septum ; and right, pos^L the third (left or infundibular), the largest and most moveable, is t£™or and placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the infundi- bulum. The tricuspid valve consists of a duplicating of the lining mem- sJ^"°'lire °r brane of the heart, enclosing fibrous tissue. The central part of each tongue is strong, while the edges are thin and notched ; and between the main pieces there are often thinner intermediate points. The chorda: tendinew, which keep the valve in place, ascend from attachment the musculi papillares in the intervals between the cusps, and are conk?; 'n°XS connected in each space with the two pieces of the valve boimding it.* They end on the surface of the cusps turned away from the opening, a few reaching the attached upper margin ; but the greater number join the central thickeued part, and the thin edge and point of the tongue. As the blood enters the cavity the valve is raised so as to close its use. the opening into the auricle ; and its protrusion into the latter cavity during the contraction of the ventricle is arrested by the small tendinous cords. The closure of this valve assists in producing the first sound of the heart.

The use of the valve is obvious, viz., to give free passage to fluid and use. in one direction, and to prevent its return.

They are concerned in giving rise to the second sound of the heart. Dissection. To open the cavity of the left auricle, the apex of the heart is to be raised, and a cnt is to be made across the posterior surface of the auricle from the right to the left pulmonary veins. Another short incision should be made downwards at right angles to the first. The heart must neces- sarily be held up during the exami- nation of the cavity. The CAVITY OK THE LEFT AURICLE (fig. 105) is smaller than that of the right side, and is rather oblong in shape, with its longest diameter di- rected transversely. It is joined at each end by the two pulmonary veins of that side ; and at the lower and fore part it opens into the left A^en- tricle. In the front wall, at the left ex- tremity, is the opening of the appendix (m), which is longer and narrower than the corresponding part on the right side. Musculi pectinati are also present, but on this side they are usually confined to the appendix. To the right of the opening into the appendix, on the part of the wall formed by the septum, is a superficial fossa (fig. 105, o), the remains of the oval aperture through that partition ; this is bounded below by a projecting margin, concave upwards, which is the edge of the valve that closed the opening in the foetus. This impression in the left auricle is above the fossa ovalis in the right cavity, because the aperture between the two in the foetus was an oblique canal through the septum. The apertures in this auricle are those of the four pulmonaiy veins, and the opening into the left ventricle. The mouths of each pair of pulmonary veins are close together ; those from the right lung (i) open into the extreme right of the auricle against the septum, and those from the left lung (/c) enter the opposite side of the cavity, near the appendix. The pulmonary veins have no valves. The aperture into the ventricle (Z) will be subsequently seen to have a large and com- plicated valve to guard it, as on the right side. * Diagram of the two cavities of tlio left side of the heart. ?'.

In the foetus only a very small quantity in fetus, of blood passes through the lungs ; and the left auricle receives its pure blood at once from the right auricle through the aperture in the septum (foramen ovale). Dissection. The left ventricle may be opened by an incision along How to both the anterior and the posterior surfaces, near the septum ; these ventricle, are to be joined at the apex, but are not to be extended upwards so as to reach the auricle. On raising the triangular flap the interior of the cavity will be visible. The cavity of the left vextricle (fig. 105) is longer and more ^e°™i°1jleft conical in shape than that of the opposite ventricle ; and is oval, or almost circular, on a transverse section. The apex of the cavity reaches the apex of the heart. The base APex- is turned towards the auricle ; and in it are the openings into the Base with aorta (n) and the left auricle (I), opening. The wall of this ventricle is thicker than that of the right, and AVa11' the anterior boundary is formed for the most part by the septum. Its surface is irregular, like that of the right ventricle, in con- inner snr- luce has sequence of the projection of the colunrnae carnese ; but near the iieshy great artery (aorta) the surface is smoother. There are three sets columns, of fleshy columns in this as in the right ventricle; and the musculi papillares, which give attachment to the tendinous cords of the md s°^% valve, are strongly marked : these are arranged in two large bundles, Very which spring from the right and left sides of the cavity. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is placed beneath the orifice ^^j^"^ of the aorta, but close to it, only a thin fibrous band intervening cuiar aper- between the two. It is rather smaller than the corresponding tuie' aperture of the right side, being about three inches and a half in tya\ancl circiunference, and is longest in the transverse direction. The centre of the opening corresponds to the junction of the fourth costal l'ositiou- cartilage of the left side with the sternum. It is furnished with a membranous valve (mitral) which projects into the ventricle. The mitral valve is stronger and of greater length than the tri- Mitral cuspid, and has also firmer and more tendinous cords : it takes its name from a fancied resemblance to a mitre. Attached to a fibrous ring round the aperture, it is divided below by a notch on each side into two pieces. Its segments lie one before the other, with their segments; edges directed to the sides, and their surfaces towards the front and back of the cavity. The anterior tongue of the valve intervenes between the auricular and aortic openings, and is larger and looser than the posterior.

Position of a pertures of arteries, and of auricles. Structure of the heart. Directions. Fibrous bauds form rings around auri- culo-ventri- cular and arterial openings. While the blood is entering the cavity, the cusps of the valve are separated ; and when the ventricle Contracts, they meel to eh.se the passage into the Left atiricle. In combination with the tricuspid it assists in producing the first sound of the heart. The opening of the aorta, anterior to that of the auricle, is close to the septum. This aperture is round, and rather smaller than that of the pulmonary artery, measuring slightly less than an inch in diameter. It is situate behind the left half of the sternum, on a level with the lower border of the third costal cartilage. In its interior is a valve of three semilunar or sigmoid flaps, which are thicker and stronger than the corresponding parts in the pul- monary artery, but have a like structure and attachment. The projection in the centre of each valve, the corpus Arantii, is better marked. Opposite each valve the coat of the aorta is bulged as in the pulmonary artery, though in a greater degree, and forms a hollow on the inner side, named sinus of Valsalva. The apertures of the coronary arteries are placed in two of these sinuses. Like the valves in the pulmonary artery, these meet in the middle to prevent the blood passing hack into the ventricle, and combine with them in causing the second sound of the heart. Position of the ventricular apertures. Two openings have been seen in each ventricle,— one of the auricle of its own side of the heart, and one of an artery. The apertures of the arteries (aorta and pulmonary) are nearest the septum ; and as the two vessels were originally formed from one tube, they are close together; but of the two, the pulmonary artery is anterior and moie to the left, as well as somewhat higher. The aperture of communication with each auricle is nearer the circumference of the heart, and is posterior to the artery issuing from the fore part of the ventricle. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is nearest of all to the back of the heart. Structure. The heart is composed chiefly of muscular fibres, together with certain fibrous lings and a fibro-cartilage. The structure may be studied in the heart of the sheep or ox, in which the muscular substance has been hardened, and the connective tissue destroyed by boiling, so as to allow of the fibres being sepa- rated. The description of the structure of the heart may be omitted by the student till a suitable preparation of the fibres can be made. The fibrous structure forms rings around the auriculo-ventricular and arterial orifices, and is prolonged into the valves connected with those openings. The auriculo-ventricular rings give attachment to the framework of fibrous tissue in the tricuspid and mitral valves; and the band surrounding the left auriculo-ventricular opening is blended in front with the aortic ring. The arterial rings surround the aortic and pulmonary orifices ; and the margin of each towards the artery forms three notches with intervening projections. The notches are occupied by thinner parts of the arterial wall bounding the sinuses of Valsalva ; and to the concave edges the sigmoid flaps of the valve are attached.349 AURICULAR FIBRES OF HEART. Behind the aortic opening, between it and the auriculo-ventri- Fibro-cavti- cular apertures, is a piece of fibro-cartilcujc, with which the fibrous » rings are united. muscular fibres of the heart, although involuntary are Musoutar ^ differ in their character from those of the heart. The fibres of the auricles are distinct from The striped ; but they voluntary muscles. those of the ventricles. In the wall of the auricles the fibres are mostly transverse (fig. Wtos"^ 106, a, b), and are best marked near the ventricles, though they form there but a thin layer ; and some of the fibres dip into the septum between the auricular Fig. 106.* arc trans- verse, annular, and looped. cavities. Besides this set, there are annular fibres surrounding the appendages of the auricles and the endings of the different veins ; and lastly, a few looped fibres (c, d) pass obliquely over the auricle from front to back. Dissection. The auricles having been learnt, separate them from the ventricles by dividing the fibrous auriculo - ventricular rings. Next clean the fleshy fibres of the ventricles by re- moving all the fat from the base of the heart around the two arteries (aorta and pulmonary), and from the anterior and pos- terior surfaces. Before cutting into the heart, let the student note that the anterior surface is to be recognised by the fibres turning in at the septum, with the exception of a small band at the base and another at the apex ; while on the posterior aspect the fibres are continued from the left to the right ventricle across the septum. To shew the direction of the muscular bundles in the left ventricle, Dissection divide the superficial fibres in front longitudinally near the septum, tnele, and transversely about half an incli below the left auriculo-ventricular opening ; and reflect a thin layer of the fibres carefully towards the left side. In the same way a second layer is to be reflected ; then a third, and so on, each layer that is raised being about as thick as the thin end of the scalpel. It will not be difficult to demonstrate thus six or seven layers in the wall ; and as each is raised, the fleshy fibres will be seen to change their direction (fig. 107). On the right side a similar dissection may be made, and a like and of number of layers may be displayed, but greater care will be necessary * Muscular fibres of the auricles, a.

As the superficial ones are raised, their fibres may he followed -into the septum in front, and across the middle line into the wall of the left ventricle at the back. Thickness of ventricular walls. The wall of the left ventricle is in general nearly three times as thick as that of the right. Its thickest part is about one-fourth of its length from the base ; and at the apex it is very thin. The free wall of the right ventricle is of more uni- form thickness than the left. The septum is about as thick as the wall of the left ventricle, except at the upper end, in a small area close below the aortic orifice, Fig. 107.* where there is a very thin part from which muscular films are absent (jpws membranacea septi). Arrangement of fibres. It has been shewn by the fore- going dissection that the di- rection of the muscular fasci- culi composing the ventricular wall varies at different depths from the.surface, and that at a given spot a number of layers may be separated, which are characterized by the difference in direction of their fibres. Such a division into distinct layers is how- ever in great measure artifi- cial, for the change in direc- tion is gradual, and many fibres pass across from one layer to another, and have to be cut to effect the separation. Over both ventricles the most superficial fibres are directed very obliquely from base to apex, and from right to left on the anterior surface, from left to right on the posterior surface. Pro- ceeding inwards, the oblicprity gradually diminishes; and in the centre of the wall the fibres are transverse. Within the last, as the cavity of the ventricle is approached, the fibres become, oblique again, but in the opposite direction to the external ones ; and the innermost fibres of all are nearly longitudinal. The attempt to trace the whole course of the bundles is, except in the case of the superficial fibres, attended with great difficulty, owing to the interlacement, branching, and joining of the fasciculi. * A diagram of the arrangement of the fibres in layers in the left ventricle. The dissection is carried through about two-thirds of the thickness of the wall. 1 2 3. Outer layers, the fibres of which gradually become less oblique. 4'. Middle layer of transverse fibres. 5.

The external oblique fibres (fig. 107,1) begin at the base of external the ventricles, where most of them spring from the auriculo-ventri- obllciue cular and arterial fibrous rings, and descend with the spiral course above described to the apex of the heart. On the posterior surface they pass without interruption from the left to the right ventricle ; but in front the fibres crossing the right ventricle in part dip in at the interventricular groove to the septum, while those continued to the left ventiicle are joined by others which issue from the septum along the furrow. At the apex of the heart they form a sharp twist, known as the vortex or whorl} and sink in to become deep and ascend towards the base as the innermost layer of the left ventricle, and internal Some of them are continued to the base and join the auriculo- onel"1"1 ventricular and aortic rings ; but others enter the papillary muscles, which are thus formed. b. The transverse or annular fibres (fig. lO?,4) are partly special to annular; the left ventricle, and partly common to the two ventricles. Some of them appear to form simple rings round the cavities, but a great many pass from this into the oblique system of fibres. c. The looped fibres of the left ventricle spring from the fibrous looped of rings at the base, and passing downwards in the ventricular wall, leffc' enter the lower part of the septum, in which they ascend to the central fibro-cartilage. d. Similar looped fibres pass from the outer wall of the right and of right ventricle through the septum to the fibro-cartilage. ventricle; e. The figure of S fibres pass from the front of the right ventricle figure of 8 through the septum to the back of the left, and from the front of the ttbrcs* left to the back of the right, the twro sets decussating in the septum. Endocardium. Lining the interior of the cavities of the heart is a Lining thin membrane, which is named endocardium. It is continuous on oTthe heart, the one hand with the lining of the veins, and on the other with that of the arteries. Where the membrane passes from an auricle to a ventricle, or from a ventricle to an artery, it forms duplicatures in which fibrous tissue is enclosed, thus giving rise to the valves ; and in the ventricles it covers the tendinous cords, and the project- ing muscular bundles. The thickness of the membrane is greater in the auricles than in the ventricles, and in the left than in the right half of the heart. Great Vessels. The arteries which take origin from the heart Vessels are the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The large veins entering £"g tbe the heart, besides the coronary sinus, are the superior and inferior cavre, and the pulmonary. The pulmonary artery is a short thick trunk, which conveys The puimo- the dark blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. From lmry artery its commencement in the right ventricle the vessel is directed up- wards and backwards on the left of the aorta ; and at a distance of divides into an inch and a half or two inches, it divides into two branches for Ule352 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX.

The left branch is directed in front of the descending aorta and the left bronchus to the fissure of the lung, where it ends in two branches for the two pulmonic lobes. As the right and left branches of the pulmonary artery pass out- wards, they cross the two bronchi diverging from the end of the trachea, and enclose with them a lozenge-shaped space which contains some bronchial glands. Ductus arteriosus. Near the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery a fibrous cord, about the size of a crow-quill, passes from the left branch of the vessel to the arch of the aorta. This is the remnant of the ductus arteriosus of the foetus, and is named the ligament of the arterial duct. In the foetus the right and left branches of the pulmonary artery are small, and the trunk is continued by the ductus arteriosus, which opens into the aorta beyond the origin of the last great branch (subclavian) of the arch. The impure blood then passes I'rom the pulmonary artery mainly through the arterial duct into the aorta, below the attachment of the vessels of the head and neck, ia order that it may be transmitted to the placenta to be purified. But after birth, when the function of the lungs is established, the current of blood is directed along the brandies of the pulmonary artery instead of through the arterial duet ; and this tube becoming gradually smaller, is occluded by the eighth or tenth day, and forms finally the ligament of the arterial duct. The Aorta is the great systemic vessel which conveys the arterial blood from the heart to the different parts of the body. It first arches backwards to reach the spinal column, along which it is then con- tinued downwards through the chest and abdomen. In the thorax the vessel is divided into two parts—the arch of the aorta, and the descending thoracic aorta. Arch of the aorta (fig. 108). The aorta has its origin in the left ventricle of the heart, and curving backwards to the left of the windpipe and the gullet, forms an arch which ceases on the left side of the spinal column, at the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra. The arch has its convexity upwards, and its concavity to the root of the left lung ; and from it the large vessels for the supply of the upper part of the body take their origin. For purposes of descrip- tion it is divided into three parts—ascending, transverse, and descending. The first or ascending part is about two inches in length, or slightly more, and is directed upwards behind, and close to the sternum : it The aorta extends through chest and abdomen. Its first pai t is arched. Extent and divi- sions of the arch. First part:ARCH OF THE AORTA. 35 :i reaches as high as the upper border,of the cartilage of the second rib on the right side, and is contained nearly altogether in the peri- cardium. The pulmonary artery is at first superficial to it, but afterwards lies on its left side. Behind it are the left auricle of the heart and the right branch of the pulmonary artery. On the right side is the descending cava. Near the heart Fig. 103.* the vessel bulges oppo- site the flaps of the valve ('sinuses of Valsalva ; fig. 108). There is some- times another dilatation along the right side, which is named the great sinus of Hie aorta. The second or trans- verse part recedes from the sternum, and reaches from the second right costal cartilage to the lower border of the body of the fourth dorsal ver- tebra on the left side. It rests upon the trachea, the oesophagus and the thoracic duct. Lying in front of this part of the artery are the vagus, phrenic, and superficial cardiac nerves of the left side,—the first nerve sending backwards its recurrent branch beneath the vessel. Along the upper border is the left innominate vein (g), to which the left upper intercostal vein (i) is directed over the left side of the arch ; and to the lower border, near its termination, the remnant of the arterial duct (e) is attached. From it arise the three great vessels of the head and upper limbs. The third or descending part of the arch is very short, extending from the lower edge of the fourth to that of the fifth dorsal ver- tebra. It lies against the fifth vertebra, and the fibro-cartilage between this and the fourth, and is covered by the pleura of the left side of the chest. In the concavity of the arch of the aorta are contained the root of the left lung, the branching of the pulmonary artery with its arterial duct, and the left recurrent nerve. The branches of the arch of the aorta are five in number: two come from the ascending, and three from the transverse part. The first two are the coronary arteries of the heart (o), which have already been noticed (p. 340). The other three are much larger, * Arch of the aorta and its great branches, a. Aortic arch. b.

The great veins are :- Vena cava .superior: formed by innominate and supply the neck, the Lead, and the upper limbs. First on the right is the large trunk of the innominate artery (6) : close to it is the left carotid (c) ; and last of all comes the left subclavian (d). The innominate artery (brachio-cephalic; 6), the first and largest of the three branches, measures from one inch and a half to two inches in length. Ascending to the right beneath the sternum, it divides opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation into the right common carotid and subclavian arteries. The artery is crossed by the left innominate vein (g), and lies behind the upper piece of the sternum, and the origins of the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. At first it rests on the trachea, but as it ascends it is placed on the right side of the airtube. To its right is the innominate vein of the same side (Ji). Usually no lateral branch arises from this artery. Left common carotid artery (c). The common carotid artery of the left side of the neck is longer than the right by the distance between the arch and the top of the sternum. In the thorax the artery ascends obliquely to the left sterno- clavicular articulation, but not so close as the innominate to the first piece of the sternum and the origin of the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone and larynx. In this course it passes beneath the left innominate vein (</), and the remains of the thymus gland. At first it lies on the trachea, but afterwards inclines to the left of that tube, so as to be placed over the oesophagus and the thoracic duct. To its outer side is the left vagus, with one or more cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve. The LEFT subclavian artery (d) ascends to the neck through the upper aperture of the thorax, and then curves outwards between the scaleni, where it has the same relations as the vessel of the right side (p. 68). The trunk is directed almost vertically from the arch of the aorta to the level of the first rib. In the thorax it is deeply placed, near the spine. To its inner side is at first the trachea, and after- wards the oesophagus with the thoracic duct. On its outer side it is invested by the left pleura ; and the left innominate vein crosses in front of the vessel as it enters the neck. Somewhat anterior to the level of the artery, though running in the same direction, are some of the cardiac nerves. The relations of the first part of the left subclavian artery in the neck are given on p. 116. Veins (fig. 108). In addition to the cardiac veins (p. 340), there are the superior and inferior cavse, and the pulmonary veins ;—the former are the'great systemic vessels which return impure blood to the right auricle of the heart; and the latter convey pure blood from the lungs into the left auricle. The superior or descending cava (/) results from the union of the right and left innominate veins, and brings to the heart the blood of the head and neck, upper limbs, and thorax. Its origin is placed behind the junction of the first costal cartilage of the right side with the sternum. From that spot the large veinSUPERIOR CAVA AND INNOMINATE VEINS. 3-55 descends to the pericardium, perforates the fibrous layer of that bag course; about one inch and a half above the heart, and ends in the right auricle. On its outer surface the vein is covered by the pleura, and the pbrenic nerve is in contact with it. To the inner side are the relations innominate artery and the ascending part of the arch of the aorta. Behind the vein is the root of the right lung. "When the cava is about to perforate the pericardium it is joined branches by the large azygos vein of the thorax (k) ; and higher up it receives small veins from the pericardium, and the parts in the mediastinal space. The innominate veins are two in number, right and left; and Brachto- each is formed near the inner end of the clavicle by the junction of veins: the subclavian and internal jugular veins. Below, they are united in the superior cava. The trunks differ in length and direction, and in their relations to surrounding parts. The right vein (h) is about one inch long, and descends almost right, vertically, on the right side of the innominate artery, to its junction with the opposite vein. On the outer surface the pleura covers it, and along it the phrenic nerve is placed. The left vein (g) is nearly three inches in length, and is directed and left; obbquely to the right, along the upper border of the arch of the aorta. It crosses behind the sternum, and the remains of the thymus gland; and it lies on the three large branches of the aortic arch, as well as on the nerves descending over the arch. The branches of the veins are nearlv alike on the two sides. Each *neir. branches. receives the vertebral, the internal mammary, and the inferior thyroid of its own side ; and the left vein is joined in addition by the superior intercostal, and some small thymic and pericardial veins. Sometimes the innominate veins are not united in the vena cava, |°™e*iin®3 but descend separately to the heart, where each has a distinct separately opening in the right auricle. When such a condition exists, the J^^116 right vein takes the course of the upper cava in front of the root of the right lung; but the left vein descends in front of the root of the left lung, and turning to the back of the heart, receives the cardiac veins, before it opens into the right auricle. A cross branch generally connects the two above the arch of the aorta. This occasional condition in the adult is a regular one in a very early period of the growth of the foetus ; and the two vessels are also persistent in some mammalia. Change of the two veins into one. The changes taking place in the veins How two during foetal growth, to produce the usual arrangement in the adult, concern arc changed the trunk on the left side. The following is an outline of them. First a lnt0 one' cross branch is formed between the two trunks, and this enlarging gives rise to the left innominate vein. Then the left trunk below the cross branch dis- appears at its middle, and undergoes transformation at each end :—At the upper end it becomes converted into a part of the superior intercostal vein, and coro- At the lower end it remains pervious for a short distance as the coronary sinus; nar>' sinus and the small oblique vein opening into the end of that sinus in the adult formed- (p. 340) is a remnant of the trunk as it lay beneath the heart.

The anatomy of this vein will be given with the vessels of the abdomen (p. 530). The pulmonary veins are two on each side. They issue from the hilum of the lung, and end in the left auricle : their position to the other vessels of the root has been noticed at p. 336. The right veins are longer than the left, and lie beneath the right auricle of the heart. The superior receives its roots from the upper and middle lobes of the lung; and the inferior vein is formed by branches from the lower lobe. The left veins cross in front of the descending aorta; and one springs from each lobe of the lung. NERVES OF THE THORAX. Nerves of the thorax. To trace vagus. Phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus, passes to diaphragm. Right nerve ahove root of lung. Left nerve above root. The pneumo-gastric and the sympathetic nerves supply the viscera of the thorax; and the phrenic nerve courses through the cavity to the diaphragm. Dissection. The phrenic nerves have already been fully displayed in the thorax; but the pneumo-gastric nerves are now to be prepared. The vagus is to be followed, on each side, behind the root of the lung, and its large plexus in that position is to be dissected out : some fine branches from the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, coming forwards over the spinal column to the plexus, must also be looked for. To the front of the root the vagus supplies a few filaments. Beyond the root, the nerve is to be pursued along the oesophagus by raising the lung and removing the pleura. The phrenic nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus (p. 74). In its course through the thorax it lies along the side of the pericardium, and at a little distance in front of the root of the lung, with a small companion artery. When near the diaphragm it divides into branches, which perforate the muscle, and are dis- tributed on the under surface. The nerves of opposite sides differ in length, and in their relations above the root of the lung. The right nerve is deeper at first, and is also shorter and straighter than the left. In entering the chest it crosses behind the subclavian vein, but in front of the internal mammary artery ; and it lies afterwards along the right side of the innominate vein and superior cava till it reaches the pericardium. The left nerve crosses the subclavian artery, but has the same position as the right to the mammary vessels when entering the cavity. In the thorax it is directed in front of the arch of the aorta to the root of the lung, and makes a curve lower down around the projecting heart. Before reaching the aorta the nerve is placed external to the left common carotid artery; and it crosses the left vagus from without inwards, so as to be internal to that nerve op the arch.357 PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERVE.

A small part of this artery, which internal lies beneath the first rib, and winds round the phrenic nerve and artery1*17 the innominate vein to reach the side of the sternum, is now to be seen. It gives the following offset :— The superior phrenic branch (comes nervi phrenici) is a very gives slender artery, which accompanies the phrenic nerve to the dia- {Jancii0 phragm, and is distributed to that muscle, anastomosing therein with the phrenic artery from the aorta (p. 528), and with the mus- culo-phrenic branch of the internal mammary (p. 259). The pneumo-gastric or vagus nerve passes through the thorax Vagus to the abdomen. In the lower part of the thorax the right and left nerve- nerves have a similar position, for they pass behind the root of the lung, each on its own side, and along the oesophagus to the stomach. But above the root of the lung, the two nerves have different rela- tions. Each supplies branches to the viscera, viz., to the heart, the windpipe and lungs, and the gullet. The right vagus enters the thorax between the subclavian artery Right vagus and the innominate vein, and is directed obliquely backwards, by of iun»°° the side of the trachea, to the posterior aspect of the root of the lung, where it gives rise to the posterior pulmonary plexus. From and on the plexus two large offsets are continued to the back of the gullet, esophagus, and unite below into one trunk, which reaches the posterior surface of the stomach. The left nerve appears in the thorax on the outer side of the left Left nerve common carotid artery, and courses over the arch of the aorta, and of"™™' beneath the root of the lung, forming there a larger plexus than on the right side.

Pulmonary brandies. There are two sets of nerves for the lung, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior aspect of the root. The anterior branches, two or three in number, are small, and communicate with filaments of the sympathetic on the pulmonary artery : these nerves are best seen on the left side. The posterior branches are larger and much more numerous. Forming a plexiform arrangement (posterior pulmonanj plexus) be- hind the root of the lung by the flattening and splitting of the trunk of the nerve, they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth ganglia of the knotted cord of the sympathetic, and are con- veyed into the lung on the divisions of the airtube. d.

In the thorax the sympathetic nerve con- sists of a knotted cord along each side of the spinal column, which communicates with the spinal nerves ; and of a large prevertebral or cardiac plexus, which distributes branches to the heart and the lungs. The gangliated cord will be seen in a future stage of the dissec- tion, after the heart and the lungs have been removed (p. 368). The cardiac plexus lies over the lower end of the trachea, and above the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. A part of this net- work, the superficial cardiac plexus, has been already described (p. 341). The remaining part, or the deep cardiac plexus, is placed beneath the arch of the aorta. Directions. The cardiac plexus has been injured by the previous examination of the heart, so that it should be dissected in a body in which the heart and the large vessels are entire. Dissection. The arch of the aorta is to be cut across near the ' heart, and is to be drawn over to the left side : next, the upper cava is to be divided above the entrance of the azygos vein, and its lower part is to be thrown down. By the removal of some fibrous and fatty tissues and lymphatic glands, the right part of the plexus will be seen in front of the trachea, above the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The offsets to the heart should be followed downwards on the trunk of the pulmonary artery ; and those to the lung should be traced along the right branch of that vessel. To lay bare the part of the plexus into which the nerves of the left side enter, the arch of the aorta is to be cut through a second time, between the subclavian artery and the attachment of the ligament of the ductus arteriosus ; and the transverse part of the arch is to be turned upwards with the great vessels attached. The lymphatic glands and the areolar and fatty tissue being cleared away from the plexus as on the opposite side, the offsets to the left coronary plexus of the heart will be visible.359 CARDIAC NERVES. The deep cardiac plexus is situate between the trachea and the arch Deep cardiac of the aorta, and consists of right and left halves, which are joined p ex by cross branches. In it are united the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic and vagus, with the exception of two branches of the left side ; and from it nerves are furnished to the heart and lungs. The right part of the plexus is placed above the right branch of Right part, the pulmonary artery, and receives the nerves of the right side, viz., ow onne the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic in the neck, the cardiac branches of the trunk of the vagus in both the neck and chest, and the cardiac offsets of the recurrent branch.

Trachea The trachea, or windpipe, reaches from the larynx to the lungs, and lies on the front of the spinal column. The tube begins bronchi opposite the sixth cervical vertebra ; and it ends commonly at I In- lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra by dividing into two pieces (bronchi), one for each lung, in the neck. Its relations in the neck are described on p. 119, and its structure on p. 168. The part in the thorax remains to be studied, its relations In the thorax the trachea is situate with the great vessels in the thorax. superior mediastinum ; and its lower end is usually inclined some- what to the right side. Here it is covered by the arch of the aorta, by the innominate and left carotid arteries, and by the cardiac plexus of nerves. Behind the airtube is the oesophagus, which projects to the left above the arch of the aorta. On the right side are the pleura, the vagus, and the innominate artery for a short distance, after this has passed over the trachea ; and on the left side lie the left subclavian artery, and the recurrent branch of the vagus. Bronchi lie The bronchi, or the branches of the airtube, are contained in the "fthoimigs; roots °f the lungs, and are surrounded by vessels, glands and nerves.

After death, the colour of the posterior border may be bluish-black from the accumulation of blood. To the touch the lung is soft and yielding, and on a section the Consistence, pulmonary substance appears like a sponge ; but the lung which is deprived of air by pressure has a tough leathery feel. Slight pressure with the thumb and finger drives the air from the con- Crepitation, taining spaces through the pulmonary structure, and produces the noise known as crepitation. If the lung contains serum or mucus, a frothy red fluid will run out when it is cut. The texture of the lung is very elastic, this elasticity causing the and elasti- organ to contract when the thorax is opened, and to expel air that may be blown into it. The specific gravity of the lung varies with the conditions of dilatation and collapse, or of infiltration with fluid. When the ° pulmonary substance is free from fluid, and filled with air, it floats iu water ; but when it is quite deprived of air it is slightly heavier than water, and therefore sinks. The weight of the lung is jj"(t1h"',j'jf]l11,rt influenced greatly by the quantity of foreign material contained in its texture ; ordinarily it ranges from sixteen to twenty-four ounces, the right lung being about two ounces heavier than the left. In the male the lungs are larger, and together about twelve ounces heavier than in the female. Obvious structure of the lung. The substance of the lung is Lung con- composed of small polyhedral masses or lobules, which are hollow, johuies, and and again subdivided into minute vesicles called the air-cells. The these or air- lobules are visible as little polygonal areas upon the surface of the lung; and by inflating a portion of the organ, the cellular structure may be seen. The several lobules are united together by connective tissue without fat; and each is attached to a terminal branch of the airtube, and receives offsets of the pulmonary vessels. The lung is invested by the pulmonic pleura, except at the hilum, Serous where the vessels enter. The serous membrane is thin and trans- ' enB8 parent, and is closely attached to. the lung-substance by means of a fine layer of subserous areolar tissue, which is continuous with the interlobular tissue. Both the pleura and the subserous tissue are and sub- very elastic, so that in the collapsed state the surface of the lung is serous layer- still smooth. Arrangement of the airtube and pulmonary artery entering the lung. Relation of It has already been seen that in the root of the lung the pulmonary {^Thus, artery lies at first in front of the bronchus ; but before entering the organ the artery crosses over, and gains the posterior surface of the airtube.

From this arrangement it would appear that the lower half of the left bronchus and the two lobes of the362 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Airtubes in lung: mode of brandling ; structure ; and ending. Vessels are two sets :— Lymphatics, Pulmonary nerves. left lung are represented on the right side by the continuation of the bronchus below the artery and the middle and lower lobes of the lung ; and that the upper lobe of the right lung with its division of the airtube have no representatives on the left side (Aeby). Bronchial branches in the lung. If the primary divisions of the bronchi be followed into the lung, they will be found to give off secondary branches ; and these, together with the smaller offsets of the air-passages, divide for the mo«t part dichotomously. The branches of the airtube within the lung are known as the bronchia or bronchial tubes, and differ from the bronchi in being circular in section. Their structure resembles that of the bronchi ; but the pieces of cartilage are irregular in shape and occur on all sides of the tube, and the muscular tissue completely surrounds the canal. The ultimate bronchial tubes are about half a line in diameter; and each leads to a group of somewhat funnel shaped dilatations (infundibula), which are beset with air-cells and form the lobules of the lung. Vessels op the lukw. Two sets of vessels are furnished to the lung, viz., the pulmonary, which bring blood to the lung to be aerated, and then return it to the heart, and the smaller bronchial, which convey the blood destined for the nutrition of the lung. The pulmonary artery divides like the bronchus, and within the lung its branches run usually on the posterior surface of the bronchial tubes, which they accompany to the lobules. The arterial branches do not anastomose together ; and they end in the capillary network of the air-cells. The pulmonary veins are not so regular in their arrangement as the arteries. They arise from the network of the air-cells ; and the branches from adjoining lobules communicate freely together. The larger branches for the most part lie in front of the airtubes which they accompanjr. The pulmonary veins have no valves. The bronchial arteries are derived from the aorta, and enter the lung on the airtube, which they also follow in its ramifications. They distribute branches to the bronchial lymphatic glands, to the walls of the larger blood-vessels and bronchial tubes, and to the interlobular connective tissue. Other small offsets ramify on the surface of the lung beneath the pleura. On the smallest bronchial tubes minute branches anastomose with offsets of the pulmonary arteries. The bronchial veins begin by twigs corresponding with the super- ficial and deep branches of the artery, and leave the root of the lung to end in the azygos veins. Many of these veins, however, open into the pulmonary veins, both within the lung and in the root (Zuckerkandl). The lymphatics of the lung are superficial and deep : the latter accompany both the bronchia and the branches of the pulmonary vessels. All pass to the bronchial glands at the root of the lung. The nerves of the lung are derived through the pulmonary plexuses from the vagus and sympathetic, and follow the branches of the airtube. They have minute ganglia connected Avith their filaments.363 DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA. PARTS ON THE SPINE AND THE SYMPATHETIC CORD. In front of the spinal column are the objects in the interpleural space of the posterior mediastinum, viz., the aorta, azygos veins, thoracic duct, and oesophagus ; and beneath the pleura on each side of the spine is the sympathetic nerve. Dissection. The thoracic duct should be found first near the dia- Dissection phragm by removing the pleura ; there it is about as large as a duct,0™"' crow-quill, and rests against the right side of the aorta : this slender vessel may be injected with tallow. The areolar tissue and the pleura are to be cleared away from the 0f other different things before mentioned ; and the azygos veins, one on the objects' right and two on the left of the aorta, should be dissected. Next follow the thoracic duct upwards beneath the arch of the aorta, and along the oesophagus beneath the pleura, till it leaves the upper aperture of the thorax. After raising the pleura from the inner surface of the chest, andof sym- the gangliated cord of the sympathetic nerve will be seen lying over the heads of the ribs. Branches are to be followed outwards from the ganglia to the intercostal nerves ; and others inwards over the bodies of the vertebrae,—the lowest and largest of these forming the three trunks of the splanchnic nerves. The DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA is the part of the great Systemic Descending vessel between the termination of the arch and the diaphragm. Its *10°^c.ic extent is from the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra (the left extent; side) to the front of the last dorsal vertebra. Contained in the posterior mediastinum, the vessel is rather coarse; curved, lying at its upper end on the left, but below on the front of the spinal column. Beneath it are the vertebras and the smaller and rela- azygos veins. In front of the vessel are the root of the left lung tions- and the pericardium. On its left side it is covered throughout by the pleura ; and on its right side are the oesophagus, the thoracic duct, and the large azygos vein, though near the diaphragm the gullet is placed over the aorta. The branches of the vessel are distributed to the surrounding Branches, parts, and are named from their destination bronchial, pericardial, oesophageal, mediastinal, and intercostal. a.

The pericardial branches are some irregular twigs, which are furnished to the posterior part of the cardiac bag. c. The oesophageal branches are four or five in number, and ramify in the gullet, forming anastomoses with one another; above, they communicate with branches of the inferior thyroid artery; and below, with twigs of the coronary artery of the stomach. d. Small mediastinal branches (posterior) supply the areolar tissue and the glands in the interpleural space. e. The intercostal arteries are nine on each side, and pass to the same number of lower intercostal spaces : to the upper two spaces branches are supplied from the intercostal artery of the subclavian trunk. These vessels arise from the posterior part of the aorta, and run outwards on the bodies of the vertebra), beneath the cord of the sympathetic nerve, to the intercostal spaces, where each divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. In this course the upper arteries have a somewhat oblique direction ; and as the aorta lies on the left of the spine, the right vessels are the longer ; the right run also beneath the cusophagus, the thoracic duct, and the large azygos vein. Many twigs are supplied to the bodies of the vertebrae. In the intercostal space, the anterior branch, the larger of the two, continues onwards between the muscular strata to the front of the chest, where it ends by anastomosing with an intercostal branch of the internal mammary artery (p. 260). At first the artery lies in the middle of the space, beneath the pleura, and resting on the external intercostal muscle ; but near the angle of the rib it ascends to the upper boundary. Accompanying the artery are the intercostal vein and nerve,—the vein being commonly above, and the nerve below it ; but in the upper spaces the nerve is, at first, higher than the artery. Branches are furnished to the intercostal muscles, and to the ribs. Near the angle of the rib a larger branch is given off, which runs forwards along the lower border of the space, and joins in front a branch of the internal mammary ; and about the centre (from front to back) of the intercostal space a superficial twig arises, to accom- pany the lateral cutaneous nerve (p. 260). The highest artery of the aortic set of intercostals anastomoses with the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery ; and the last two are continued in front into the abdominal wall, where they lie between the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and anastomose with the epigastric and lumbar arteries (p. 453). The posterior branch turns backwards between the vertebra and the ascending costo-transverse ligament, and is distributed in the back (p. 397). As it passes the intervertebral foramen it furnishes a small spinal branch to the vertebra and the spinal cord. (See vessels OF THE SPINAL CANAL.) The intercostal vein resembles closely the artery in its course and365 AZYGOS VEINS. branching. Near the head of the rib it receives a contributing dorsal branch, and then joins an azygos vein. The superior intercostal artery of the subclavian trunk (p. 71) ?^"0°rtal descends over the neck of the first rib, external to the cord of the sympathetic, and supplies a branch to the first intercostal space : ^es one continuing to the second space, which it supplies in like manner, it spaces, ends by anastomosing with the upper aortic branch. Its intercostal offsets divide into anterior and posterior branches, which are distributed like the arteries from the aorta. The azygos veins are two in number on the left side and one on Three the right, and receive branches corresponding to the offsets furnished veius.S by the descending thoracic aorta. The right or large azygos (fig. 109,3) begins in the lumbar veins Large on the right side of the spine ; and its origin is described with the right side, vessels of the abdomen (p. 538). It enters the thorax through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and ascends on the right side of the aorta and thoracic duct, over the intercostal arteries and the bodies of the vertebrae. Opposite the fifth rib the vein arches for- wards above the root of the right lung, and enters the superior cava and joins as this vessel pierces the pericardium. Its valves are few and very cava?°r incomplete, so that the intraspinal and intercostal veins may be injected through it. Branches. In this vein are collected the intercostals of the right branches side with the exception of the first; most of the intercostals of the J0inmg 1 " left side of the thorax, through the left azygos veins ; and some small oesophageal, mediastinal, and vertebral veins, with the right bronchial vein. By means of the right azygos vein the inferior communicates with the superior cava, so that blood may reach the heart from the lower half of the body if the inferior cava should be obstructed. The left lotoer azygos vein (fig. 109,4) begins in the abdomen in Left lower the lumbar veins on the left side of the vertebral column. Entering vein the thorax along with the aorta, or through the crus of the begins in diaphragm, the vein ascends on the left of the aorta as high as the abtlome"> ninth or eighth dorsal vertebra, where it crosses beneath thatends vessel and the thoracic duct to end in the right azygos. It receives azygos: the three or four lower intercostal veins of the left side, and some brandies, oesophageal and mediastinal branches.

Some compoimd glands (oesophageal) are scattered along the tube, Some^ and are most numerous at the lower end of the gullet. Lymphatics of the Thorax. In the thorax are lymphatic vessels Lymphatics of the wall and the viscera, which enter collections of glands, and Sorax. end in one or other of the lymphatic ducts. Besides these, the large thoracic duct traverses the thorax in its course from the abdomen to the neck. Lymphatic glands. Along the course of the internal mammary sternal artery lies a chain of sternal glands, which receive lymphatics from glands- the upper part of the abdominal wall, the front of the chest, the mamma, and the fore part of the diaphragm. On each side of the spine, near the heads of the ribs, as well as Intercostal, between the intercostal muscles, is placed a group of intercostal glands for the reception of the lymphatics of the posterior wall of the thorax. Three or four anterior mediastinal glands lie in the fore part of Anterior , * n , -i p met litis tinsi. the interpleural space, and receive lymphatics from the upper surface of the liver and the diaphragm. Numerous bronchial glands are situate at the division of the Bronchial. trachea, and along the bronchi; through them the lymphatics of the lung pass. Along the side of the aorta and oesophagus is a chain of jwsterior Posterior mediastinal glands, which are joined by the lymphatics of the ""e^28*11111'- oesophagus, and hinder parts of th.e pericardium and diaphragm. Along the front and lower border of the arch of the aorta are the Superior superior mediastinal or cardiac glands, which receive the lymphatics of the heart, the pericardium, and the thymus. The thoracic ddct (fig. 109,1) is the main channel by which Thoracic the lymph of the lower half of the body, and of the left side of the upper half of the body, as well as the chyle, is conveyed into the blood. The duct begins in the. abdomen in an enlargement heginsin (receptaculum chyli; p. 534), and ends in the veins of the leftside of men^d the neck. It is from fifteen to eighteen inches in length, and is n"^iu contained in the thorax, except at its origin and termination. It has the following course and relations :— Entering the cavity through the same opening as the aorta, the Relations duct ascends on the right side of that vessel as high as the arch, thorax. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra it passes beneath the aortic arch, and is then applied to the left side of the oesophagus, on which it is conducted to the neck under the left subclavian artery. At the lower part of the neck the duct arches outwards, as before described (p. 116), to open into the left subclavian vein at its junction with the internal jugular. In this course the tube is oftentimes divided in two, which unite It may be again ; or its divisions may even form a plexus. Near its termina-tllvlded > tion it is frequently branched.

The right lymphatic duct (fig. 28) receives large branches from the viscera of the thorax. It is a short trunk, about half an inch in length, and opens into the angle of union of the subclavian and jugular veins of the same side (p. 71) : its opening is guarded by valves. .Branches. Into this trunk the lymphatics of the right upper limb and right side of the head and neck pour their contents. In addition, the lymphatics of the right side of the chest, right lung and right half of the heart, and some from the right lobe of the liver, after passing through their re- spective glands, unite into a few large trunks, which ascend beneath the innomi- nate vein to reach the duct in the neck. Cord of the sympathetic nerve. The thoracic part of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic nerve is covered by the pleura, and is placed over the heads of the ribs and the intercostal vessels. The ganglia on it are usually twelve, one being opposite each dorsal nerve, but this number is frequently reduced by the fusion of two adjoining swellings. The first ganglion is the largest; and the last two are rather anterior to the line of the others, being situate on the side of the bodies of the corresponding vertebra?. Each ganglion furnishes external branches to communicate with the spinal nerves, and internal for the supply of the viscera. External or connecting branches (fig. 110). Two offsets pass outwards from each gang- lion to join a spinal nerve (intercostal). In the branches of communication both spinal and sympathetic nerve-fibres are combined ; but one (h) consists almost entirely of spinal, and the other (i) mainly of sym- pathetic fibres. The internal or visceral branches differ in size and distribution, according as they are derived from the upper or lower ganglia. The offsets of the upper six ganglia are very small, and are dis- tributed to the aorta, and to the vertebrae with the ligaments. From the third and fourth ganglia offsets are sent to the posterior pulmonary plexus. * The thoracic duct, and the azygos veins. 1. Thoracic duct. 2.

Descending on the bodies of the vertebrae, it pierces the fibres of the eras of the diaphragm, and ends in the semilunar gang- lion of the abdomen. At the lower part of the thorax the nerve may present a ganglion. The small splanchnic nerve begins in the tenth and eleventh ganglia, or in the intervening cord. It is transmitted inferiorly through the cms of the diaphragm, and enters the part of the solar plexus by the side of the cceliac artery. The smallest splanchnic nerve springs from the last ganglion, and accompanies the other nerves through the diaphragm; in the abdomen it ends in the renal plexus.

They are uncertain in number, but there may be ten : they are smaller above than below, and the upper and lower may pass over more than one space. Action. The subcostals draw together, and depress the ribs, thus acting as expiratory muscles. Intercostal muscles. The anterior part of these muscles has been described (p. 257) ; and the posterior part may be now examined from the inner side. The inner muscle begins at the sternum, and reaches back to the angles of the ribs, or somewhat farther in the upper spaces. Where the fibres cease, a thin fascia (posterior intercostal aponeurosis) is continued inwards over the outer muscle. The inner surface is lined by the pleura, and the opposite surface is in contact with the intercostal nerve and vessels. External muscle. When the fascia and the subcostal muscles have been removed, the external intercostal will be seen between the posterior border of the internal muscle and the spine. Its fibres cross those of the inner intercostal layer. While this muscle extends backwards to the tuberosity of the rib, it is generally absent in front between the rib-cartilages (p. 258). Action. The use of the intercostal muscles in respiration is given on p. 258. Dissection. In a few spaces the internal intercostal muscle may be cut through, and the intercostal nerve and artery traced out- wards. The intercostal nerves, eleven in number, are anterior primary branches of dorsal nerves ; and they pass from the intervertebral foramina into the intercostal spaces without forming a plexus. Near the head of the rib each nerve is joined to the sympa- thetic by two communicating filaments (p. 368). The upper six are confined to the wall of the thorax ; but the lower five are prolonged into the abdominal wall, where the ribs cease in front. The anterior branch of the twelfth dorsal nerve lies below the last . rib, and is seen in the dissection of the abdomen. Upper six nerves. At first the nerves lie between the pleura and the external intercostal muscle with an artery and vein ; but they soon enter between the intercostal muscles, and extend forwards to the side of the sternum (p. 260). In their course they supply branches to the muscles of the thoracic wall, viz., the subcostals, intercostals, and triangularis stemi, as well as to the levatores costarum and serrati muscles of the back, and cutaneous offsets to the surface, which are described in the dissection of the upper limb (p. 244). There are some deviations in the first and second nerves from the arrangement above specified. The first nerve (fig. 74) ascends in front of the neck of the first, rib, arid enters the brachial plexus. Before it leaves the chest it supplies to the first intercostal space a branch, which furnishes371 UPPER SURFACE OF DIAPHRAGM. muscular offsets, and becomes cutaneous by tbe side of the sternum. There is not any lateral cutaneous offset from this branch, except when the second nerve is not as large as usual. The second nerve may extend a considerable way on the wall of Second the chest before entering between the intercostal muscles; and itlierve* frequently sends upwards a branch to join the first nerve. It is remarkable in having a very large lateral cutaneous branch (p. 244). In front it ends bike the others.

The ligaments attaching the costal cartilages to the sternum to be dissected on the part of the thorax which was removed opening the cavity. Ligaments op the head of the rib. Where the head of the rib is received into a hollow in the bodies of two contiguous vertebra?, there are two ligaments to the arti- culation—anterior costo-central and interarticular, with two synovial sacs. The anterior costo-central or stellate ligament (fig. Ill,3) is composed of radiating fibres, which pass from the head of the rib to the two vertebral bodies forming the articular cavity, and to the disc between them. Where the rib is in contact only with one vertebra, i.e., in the first, eleventh and twelfth, a few fibres ascend to the vertebra immediately above. The interarticular ligament will be seen when the stellate is divided. It is a very short thin band, which is attached on one side to the ridge separating the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib, and on the other to the intervertebral disc. In the joints of the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, where the head is not in contact with the intervertebral substance, this ligament is absent. Synovial sacs. There are usually two synovial cavities in the costo-central articulation, one on each side of the interarticular ligament ; but in the three joints before mentioned (1st, 11th, 12th) there is but one.. Ligaments of the neck and tuberosity. Three ligaments pass from the neck and tuberosity of the rib to the transverse processes of the two vertebras with which the head is connected : and the tuberosity forms a synovial joint with the transverse process of the lower vertebra. The superior costo-transzerse ligament (fig. Ill,4) is larger and longer than the others. It ascends from the upper edge of the neck of the rib to the transverse process of the vertebra above : if is wanting to the first rib. Between this ligament and the vertebra the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves pass ; and externally it is continued into the posterior intercostal aponeurosis. The posterior costo-transverse ligament (fig. 118,;t) is a short band * Ligaments of the ribs and vertebras (Bourgery). 1. Anterior ligament of the bodies of the vertebra;. 2.

The middle or interosseous costo-transverse ligament is placed and middle; between the neck of the rib and the transverse process which the tuberosity touches. It will be best seen by sawing horizontally through the rib and the transverse process. Its fibres are collected into separate bundles, with fatty tissue between them. The synovial cavity of the costo-transverse articulation will be synovial opened by dividing the posterior ligament. There is no joint between the last two ribs and their transverse Differences processes ; and the posterior and middle costo-transverse ligaments and^twemu are united in one band. ribs- Movements of the ribs. The ribs undergo a movement of rotation The ribs ground an axis which passes through the costo-central articulation around an in a direction corresponding very nearly to that of the neck of the axis bone. By this rotation the fore part of the rib is carried upwards and outwards in inspiration, and downwards and inwards in expiration. The degree of outward movement is necessarily pro- which is portionate to the obliquity of the axis, and is therefore greater in oblique. e*S the case of the lower ribs than the upper, since the backward inclination of the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras, and of the necks of the ribs, increases from above downwards. The lower The lower ribs, while being elevated, also move somewhat backwards, their m0Ve back- tuberosities gliding over the sloped facets of the transverse processes ; ^^J"'1 and in the eleventh and twelfth ribs the upward and downward movements are but slight, while the forward and backward move- ments are relatively free, owing to the absence of the costo-transverse articulation. Costal cartilage with the rib. The end of the rib is hollowed Rib and to receive the costal cartilage, and the two are directly united. The cartllase- periosteum of the rib is continued into the perichondrium of the cartilage. Chondro-sternal Articulations. The cartilages of the true Costal car- ribs, except the first, are articulated to the sternum by synovial tile sternum, joints. The extremity of each cartilage is received into a depression on the side of the sternum, and is fixed by a surrounding capsule (fig. 51,4). In front and behind the capsule is thickened by radiat- ing fibres, which are described as anterior and posterior ligaments. In the joint of the second cartilage there is an interarticular Second car- iigament (fig. 51,6), like that to the head of the rib, which joins the SSS&jSJt cartilage between the pieces of the sternum ; and the synovial sac is double. Similar bands are sometimes present in one or two of the succeeding joints. A special band of fibres passes from the cartilage of the seventh Costo- rib to the ensiform process, and is named costo-xiphoid ligament. lament.

The ends of the eighth, ninth and tenth cartilages are united each to the cartilage above by bands of fibrous tissue. Movements. There is only a limited degree of movement in the chondro-sternal and interchondral articulations, the cartilages being elevated with the ribs in inspiration, and sinking in expiration. Articulation of the Sternum. The manubrium and body of the sternum are united by a piece of cartilage, with anterior and posterior longitudinal fibres. In some cases there is a cavity resulting from the absorption of the central portion of the cartilage. There is no appreciable movement between the pieces of the sternum, but the articulation aids in giving elasticity to the front of the chest. Articulations op the Vertebrae. The vertebra) are united together by two sets of ligaments,— one for the bodies, and the other for the arch and processes. Along the spinal column the ligaments have a general resem- blance, and one description will suffice except for those between the first two vertebra? and the head, and those of the pelvis. Dissection. After the articulations of the ribs have been examined, the same piece of the spinal column will serve for the preparation of the ligaments of the bodies of the vertebra. The anterior ligament of the bodies will be defined with very little trouble, by removing the areolar tissue. It is supposed that the spinal canal has been opened to examine the sj>inal cord, and that the posterior ligament of the bodies of the vertebras is laid bare; but if the canal should not be open, the neural arches of the vertebras are to be removed by sawing through the pedicles. The remaining ligaments be- tween the neural arches, spines, and articular processes of the bones may be dissected on the piece taken away in opening the spinal canal. Ligaments of the bodies. The bodies of the vertebras are united by an anterior and a posterior an common ligament, with an inter- vening piece of fibro-cartilage. The anterior common ligament (fig. 112, a) reaches from the axis to the sacrum. It is narrow above and wide below ; and it also in- creases in thickness from above downwards. Its fibres are longitudinal; and by detaching parts of the ligament, the superficial ones will be seen to extend over Fig. 112. * * a. Anterior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebra;, b. Lateral sliort fibres.LIGAMENTS OF YERTEBRiE. 375 three or four vertebrae, while the deepest pass from, one bone to the ^^^f next. More of the fibres are attached to the intervertebral discs than to the bones ; and few or none are fixed to the centre of the bodies. The ligament bridges over the transverse hollows on the vertebral bodies, and renders the front of the column smooth and even. On each side, over the part uncovered by the anterior common short lateral ligament, the bodies of the vertebra are united by a thin layer of flbres- short fibres (fig. 112, b). The posterior common ligament (fig. 113) is contained in the Posterior spinal canal, lying on the back of the vertebral bodies, and also ligament: «xtends from the axis to the sacrum. It is much thinner than the anterior, and, unlike that, is broad above and narrow below. It is form; wider opposite the intervertebral discs than on the bodies, so that Fig. 113a.* Fig. 113b.* the margins are dentate. In the neck (a) it covers nearly the whole breadth of the bodies ; but in the dorsal and lumbar regions (b) it is a narrow band, which sends off a pointed process on each side to be attached to the intervertebral disc and the upper margin of the pedicle. The hinder surface of the ligament is in contact with the relations j dura mater; and between the band and the centre of the bodies are intervals where large veins issue from the bones. The fibres are arranged as in the anterior ligament; and they are more closely united with the intervertebral substance than with the bone. Dissection. To see the intervertebral discs, the anterior andToseethc posterior common ligaments must be taken away ; and to show vertebral their structure, one disc should be cut through horizontally, while su1)Stance- another is to be divided vertically by sawing through the bodies of two vertebra.

It is connected in front and behind with the anterior and posterior common ligaments ; and on the sides, in the dorsal region, with the stellate and interarticular ligaments of the ribs. In the sections that have been made the intervertebral substance Fig. 114.* Fig. 115. f outer part of fibrous lam i uk : inner part of pulpy substance,, Fig. 116.: is seen to consist of two different parts,—an external, firm and laminar, and air internal, soft and pulpy (fig. 115). The outer laminar part (fig. 116, a) forms more than half of the disc. The laminae are disposed concentrically, but do not form complete rings ; and they are at- tached by their edges to the bodies of the vertebras (fig. 1 15, «). They are composed for the most part of white fibro-cartilage ; but the superficial ones consist of fibrous tissue. The fibres are parallel in each lamina, and run obliquely between two vertebrae ; but the direction is reversed in alternate layers (fig. 114). This arrangement of the fibres is best seen on the thicker discs between the lumbar vertebras ; and it may be demonstrated by dissecting layer after layer.

Placed nearer the back than the front of the disc, it is more marked situation, in the loins and neck than in the dorsal region. It has a yellowish where /» larffcst colour, and is deficient in the stratiform arrangement so conspicuous at the circumference. The surfaces of the vertebrae in contact with the disc have a Cartilage cartilaginous covering, which may be seen by cutting the inter- bones. vertebral substance from the bone.

In each interval there are two ligaments, a right and a left, which meet in the middle line, and extend from the root of the spine to the articular processes.

They are thin in the neck, and strongest in the loins. Ligaments of the spines. Along the tips of the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is a longitudinal band of fibres (fig. 118, ')—the supraspinous ligament. It is thickest in the lumbar region ; and it consists of superficial fibres which pass over three or more spines, and deep fibres which unite adjoining bones. Many of the back muscles arise from it on each side. In the same regions there are also membranous intervillous ligaments (fig. Ill, 5) reaching from the root to the tip of the spinous processes. They are thicker and broader in the lumbar than in the dorsal part of the column. * An inner view of the neural arches of the vertebra, with their interposed ligaments. (Bourgery.) 1 and 2.

The greatest movement takes place between the lower lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum ; there is an intermediate degree degree; in the neck ; and the least is in the upper half of the dorsal region, where the ribs are united to the sternum. The bodies of the bones are brought nearer together in front, movement while they are separated behind. The inferior pair of articular of bo"es' processes of the second vertebra glide upwards on the upper of the third ; the inferior processes of the third bone move in like manner on the upper of the fourth ; and so on throughout the moveable column. The ligament in front of the bodies is relaxed, but the posterior, state of and those uniting the neural arches and processes are tightened. hsamont,i- The fore part of each intervertebral disc is compressed, and the back is stretched.

Rotation is the twisting of the bodies of the vertebra) around a vertical axis through their centres, the fore part being turned to the right or left, while the lower articular processes glide in the opposite direction over the upper of the next bone below. The movement will obviously be checked by the tightening of one set of oblique fibres in the intervertebral disc. A pure rotation of this kind, however, takes place only to a small extent in the upper dorsal region ; but in the neck a greatei degree of turning movement is permitted in combination with lateral flexion, owing to the conformation of the articular surfaces. In the loins the articular surfaces are so disposed that rotation is impossible.CHAPTER V. DISSECTION OF THE BACK. —♦ Directions. The dissection of the back may be undertaken by one Directions, student; or conjointly by the dissectors of the head and upper limbs, the former preparing the neck, and the latter making ready the dorsal and lumbar regions. If the back should be allotted to more than one student, the dis- sector of the upper limb may attend chiefly to the paragraphs marked with an asterisk ; and the dissector of the neck may study specially the paragraphs which are not so marked. But as many of the dissections in the earlier stages require the co-operation of the students employed on the same side of the body, a general attention should be given to the whole by each. The dissector of the abdomen is to examine the arrangement of the fascia lmnborum, after the first layer of the dorsal muscles has been learnt. Position. The body lies with the face downwards ; and the trunk Position of is to be raised by blocks beneath the chest and the pelvis, so that the limbs may hang over the end and sides of the dissecting table. To make tense the neck, the head is to be depressed and fastened with hooks. In this region there are five successive layers of muscles, amongst ^^ta '" which vessels and nerves are interspersed. Dissection. The first step is to raise the skin in two Haps b)r To raise means of the following incisions:—One cut is to be made along theskl" the middle of the body from the occipital protuberance to the back of the sacrum Another is to be carried from the last dorsal spine to the acromion process of the scapula. The flap of skin above the last cut is to be turned outwards by the dissectors of the head and upper limb. By another transverse incision opposite the iliac crest, the remain- ing piece of integument may be detached, and reflected by the dis- sector of the upper limb in the same direction as the upper Hap. Beneath the upper flap of skin the trapezius muscle is placed, and under the lower one the latissimus dorsi. The cutaneous nerves may be now sought in the superficial fatty Se«k layer : they are accompanied by small arteries which will guide the cu.ta.".e""!' student to their position. The nerves vary much in size in theDISSECTION OF THE BACK. 382 in the neck ; in thorax and loins; sucral. Cutaneous nerves how derived. In the neck Second and third nerve.

Dissection. different parts of the back, and their number is also irregular: as a general rule, there is one opposite each vertebra except in the neck. To find them in the cervical region, look near the middle liner from the 3rd to the 6th vertebra, and trace an offset from the third nerve upwards to the head : the branch of the second nerve (great occipital) has been laid bare at the back of the head (p. 5). Over the upper part of the thorax, they will be found near the spines of the vertebras, where they lie at first beneath the fat ; but at the lower part, and in the loins, they issue in a line with the angles of the ribs. The cutaneous branches of the sacral nerves are included in the dissection of the lower limb. Cutaneous Nerves. The tegumentary nerves are derived from the posterior primary branches of the spinal nerves, which divide amongst the deep muscles into two pieces, inner and onter. Arteries accompany the greater number of the neives, bifurcate like them,, and furnish cutaneous offsets. Cervical nerves. In the neck the nerves are derived from the inner of the two branches into which the posterior trunks divide : they perforate the trapezius, and supply the neck and the back of the head. They are four in number, and come from the second,, third, fourth, and fifth nerves. The branch of the second nerve is named great occipital, and ac- companies the occipital artery to the back of the head (p. 8). The branch of the third cervical nerve supplies a transverse offset to the neck, and then ascends to the lower ]Dart of the head, where it is distributed near the middle line, communicating with the great occipital nerve (p. 8). * Dorsal nerves. These are furnished by both the inner and outer branches—the upper six or seven from the inner, and the lower five or six from the outer. On the surface they are directed outwards in the integument over the trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles. The upper nerves perforate the trapezius near the spines of the vertebras ; and the branch of the second, which is larger than the rest, extends outwards over the scapula. The lower nerves pierce the latissimus dorsi mostly in a line with the angles of the ribs ; the number of the superficial offsets from these nerves often varies. * Lumbar nerves. In the loins the nerves are derived from the outer branches of the first three trunks ; they perforate the latissi- mus dorsi muscle at the outer border of the erector spinas, and cross- ing the iliac crest of the hip-bone, are distributed in the integuments- of the buttock. * First Layer op Muscles (fig. 119). Two muscles, the trape- zius and the latissimus dorsi, are included in this layer. Dissection. The superficial fatty layer and the unimportant deep fascia are to be removed together from the trapezius and latissimus dorsi in the direction of the fibres of each, viz., from the shoulder to the spinal column ; and the upper limb is to be carried back-384 insertion.

From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, converging to the shoulder, and are inserted into the outer third of the clavicle, at its posterior aspect, into the inner border of the acromion, and into the upper border of the spine of the scapula as far as an inch from the root of that process, as well as into a rough prominence on the lower margin of the spine near the inner end. The muscle is subcutaneous. At the outer side the lowest fleshy fibres end in a small triangular tendon, which glides over the smooth surface at the root of the spine of the scapula. The upper edge forms the hinder boundary of the posterior triangular space of the neck. By its insertion the trapezius corresponds with the origin of the deltoid muscle. Action. If all the fibres of the muscle act, the scapula gliding on the ribs is moved upwards and towards the spinal column; but the upper fibres can assist other muscles in elevating, and the lower fibres will help in depressing that bone. When the scapula is prevented from gliding on the ribs, the trape- zius imparts a rotatory movement to it, and raises the acromion. Dissection. The fibres of the trapezius are to be divided near the scapula, over the situation of the spinal accessory nerve, so that the ramifications of that nerve beneath the muscle, and its junction with the branches of the cervical plexus may be observed. A small artery to the trapezius (superficial cervical) accompanies the nerve. The spinal accessory nerve (p. Ill), having crossed the pos- terior triangle of the neck, passes beneath the trapezius, and forms a plexiform union with branches of the third and fourth nerves of the cervical plexus. The nerve can be followed nearly to the lower border of the muscle. Dissection. To see the parts covered by the trapezius, the pieces of the divided muscle are to be thrown inwards and outwards. The dissector of the neck should now clean the splenitis, and define the things beneath the clavicle, viz., the posterior belly of the omo-liyoid muscle with the suprascapular nerve and vessels, as well as the transverse cervical vessels, and the small nerves to the levator anguli scapula) and rhomboid muscles. If the trapezius be detached along the middle line, the ligamentum nucha), from which it takes origin, will be brought into 'view. * The dissector of the upper limb should clean the fibres of the rhomboidei and levator anguli scapulae muscles, which are fixed to the base of the scapula; and while this is being done, the scapula is to be drawn away from the trunk to make tense the fleshy fibres. * Parts covered by the trapezius. The trapezius conceals in the neck the splenitis, a small part of the complexus, and the levator anguli scapulas ; in the dorsal region it covers the rhomboidei, the erector spina?, and the latissimus dorsi. Near the insertion it lies over the supraspinatus muscle.

It arises along the middle line from the spinous processes of sPine- the six lower dorsal, all the lumbar, and the upper sacral vertebrae, as well as from the supraspinous ligament. On the outer side it arises pelvis, from the posterior half of the outer edge of the iliac crest by its aponeurosis, and from the lowest three or four ribs by as many fleshy and ribs; processes, which interdigitate with slips of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. And in many bodies it receives another fleshy slip from the inferior angle of the scapula. The fibres are directed outwards and upwards, converging rapidly ; and the muscle, nrach reduced in breadth, turns round the lower border of the teres major, to be inserted by tendon into the bottom of the bicipital insertion groove of the humerus (p. 256). r^\hmne' The muscle is superficial, except at the upper and inner part, reidyons. where it is covered to a small extent by the trapezius. Farther out there is a space between the two, in which the rhomboid and infra- spinatus muscles appear. The lower or outer border overlaps the edge of the external oblique muscle in the interval between the last rib and the iliac crest. The aponeurosis of the latissimus is in its lower part incorporated in the posterior layer of the fascia lumborum, of which it forms the chief constituent. Action. If the arm is hanging loose, the muscle can move it use, behind the back, rotating it in at the same time. If the limb is JtaSufftae raised^ the latissimus, combining with the large pectoral and teres muscles, will depress the humerus. Supposing the arm fixed, the latissimus assists the pectoralis major and fixed, in drawing the moveable trunk towards the humerus, as in the act of climbing. * Dissection. The latissimus is to be divided about midway Dissection bet ween the spines of the vertebrae and the angle of the scapula, fatisslmus. and the pieces are to be reflected inwards and outwards. In raising the inner half of the muscle, care must be taken not to destroy either the thin lower serratus, with which it is united, or the aponeurosis continued upwards from the serratus. In the interval between the last rib and the iliac crest the latissimus is adherent to the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle, and should not be detached from it. * Parts covered by the latissimus. The latissimus dorsi lies on the Parts be. erector spinae, the serratus posticus inferior, the lower ribs with their ?im^.lati8" intercostal muscles, and the lower angle of the scapula, with parts of the rhomboideus major, infraspinatus, and teres major muscles.

In passing from the chest to the arm, the latissimus forms part of the posterior boundary of the axilla. Dimction of fascia Iwnfomm. After the latissimus dorsi has been Dissection C 0DISSECTION OF THE BACK. 386 of fascia reflected, the dissector of the abdomen can look to the disposition lumborum, 0f fascia lumborum. between the last rib and the hip-bone. In the spot referred to are portions of the external and internal oblique muscles, left in the dissection of the wall of the abdomen. After the removal of those muscles, the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis muscle (fascia lumborum) appears, and perforating it are two nerves : one, the last dorsal, with an artery near the last rib ; and the other, the ilio-hypogastric, with its vessels close to the iliac crest. to show Three layers of the fascia lumborum are to be demonstrated, intt^—yerS passing from the aponeurosis of the transversalis to the spinal posterior, column. The superficial layer is already exposed, being formed mainly by the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. To see the middle. middle layer, which passes beneath the erector spina) to the trans- verse processes, the first layer is to be divided, with the attached portion of the latissimus dorsi, by a horizontal incision carried out- wards from the third lumbar spine. On raising the outer border of the erector spina? muscle, which comes into <yiew, the strong process of the fascia will be apparent, and anterior. After cutting in the same way through this prolongation, another muscle, the quadratus lumborum, will be seen ; and on raising its outer border, the thin deepest layer of the fascia will be evident on the abdominal aspect of that muscle. Lumbar The FASCIA LUMBORUM 01' LUMBAR APONEUROSIS Occupies the fascia, interval between the last rib and the iliac crest, and extends inwards derived from to the spine. It is formed mainly by the posterior tendon of the tend™"8 transversalis muscle of the abdominal wall (fig. 140, c), but its superficial part receives important accessions from two of the muscles of the back. If the tendon of the transversalis be followed inwards, it will be found to divide at the outer edge of the quadratus lumborum into two layers, which encase that muscle ; and the posterior of these again sprits, or gives off a superficial process, at the outer margin of the erector spina?. There are thus consists of in the lumbar aponeurosis three layers of membrane, forming with three layers: t^e vertebra3 two sheaths, the one of which encloses the quadratus lumborum, and the other the multifidus and erector spinas muscles. anterior The anterior layer is thin, and passes on the abdominal surface of the quadratus lumborum to be fixed to the front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae near their tips. and middle The middle layer is the direct continuation of the transversalis tendon, and lies between the quadratus lumborum and the erector to transverse spinas muscles ; it is fixed to the extremities of the transverse processes. posterior to . The posterior or superficial layer is the thickest, and is attached pProoessSes, internally to the spines of the lumbar vertebra?. In this layer are united the aponeuroses of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior muscles, with only a small offset of the tendon of the transversalis. * Second Layer of Muscles (fig. 119). This stratum contains387 MUSCLES OF SECOND LAYER. the elevator of the angle of the scapula, and the large and small Second^ rhomboid muscles: besides these, the posterior belly of the omo- iayer. hyoid muscle, and some vessels and nerves directed outwards towards the scapula, are now to be examined. The parts referred to have been prepared in the dissection following the reflection of the trapezius (p. 384). * The levator anguli scapula (fig. 119, c) arises by tendinous Elevator of slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the ^pute: upper four cervical vertebra?. The fibres form an elongated muscle, attach- which is inserted into the base of the scapula between the spine and luents; tbe superior angle. At its origin the levator lies beneath the stemo-mastoid, and at relations j its insertion beneath the trapezius, where it meets, the serratus magnus muscle; the rest of the muscle appears in the posterior triangular space of the neck. Beneath it are some of the other cervical muscles, viz., splenius colli and cervicalis ascendens. Action. The muscle raises the angle and hinder part of the scapula, and use, and depresses the acromion; but in combination with the upper on scai)ula> fibres of the trapezius, which prevent the rotation down of the acromion, it shrugs the shoidder. When the shoidder is fixed, the neck can be bent to the side by on the neck, the levator. * Rhomboidei muscles. The muscular layer of the rhombcidei is Rhomboid attached to the base of the scapula, and consists of two pieces, large J^."sc are and small, which are usually separated by a slight interval. * The rhomboideus minor (fig. 119, d) is a thin narrow band, SmaU which arises from the spines of the seventh cervical and first dorsalIuuscle- vertebrae, and the ligamentum nucha?, and is inserted into the base of the scapula, opposite the smooth surface at the root of the spine. * The rhomboideus major (fig. 119, e) is much larger than the Lzi-ge preceding muscle. It arises from the spines of four or five dorsallnUSC e " vertebra below the rhomboideus minor, and from the supraspinous origin; ligament; and its fibres are directed outwards and downwards to be inserted into the base of the scapula between the spine and the lower insertion, angle. Sometimes the upper fibres are not fixed to the scapula directly, but end on a tendinous arch near the bone. The rhomboidei are for the most part covered by the trapezius Relations, and latissimus ; but a portion of the larger muscle is subcutaneous near the scapula. Action. From the direction of their fibres both rhomboidei will Use, by draw the base of the scapula upwards and backwards, so as to ^thTthe^ depress the acromion. In combination with the trapezius they carry the scapula directly back ; and acting with the seiratus magnus they serve to fix the scapida.

The fibres form a thin, riband-like muscle, which is directed forwards across the lower part of the neck, and ends anteriorly in a tendon beneath the sterno-mastoid (p. 64). This belly is partly placed beneath the trapezius, and is partly superficial in the pos- terior triangular space of the neck, where it lies above the clavicle- and the subclavian artery, and crosses the brachial plexus and the suprascapular nerve. Action. For the use of the muscle, see page 64. The suprascapular artery, a branch of the subclavian (p. 70)r is directed outwards through the lower part of the neck to the upper border of the scapula. It runs behind the clavicle, and crosses the suprascapular ligament in front of the omo-hyoid muscle, to enter the supraspinous fossa. Its termination on the dorsum of the scapula is seen in the dissection of the shoulder (p. 269). Before- entering the fossa it gives off a supra-acromial branch, which perforates the trapezius muscle, and ramifies over the acromion. The suprascapular nerve is an offset of the brachial plexus (p. 73), and inclines downwards beneath the omo-hyoid muscle to the notch in the upper border of the scapula, through which it passes into the supraspinous fossa (p. 269). The transverse cervical artery, also a branch of the sub- clavian (p. 70), has the same direction as the suprascapular,towards the upper angle of the scapula, but is higher than the clavicle. Crossing the upper part of the space in which the subclavian artery - lies, it passes beneath the trapezius, and divides into two branches- —superficial cervical and posterior scapular. a. The superficial cervical branch is distributed chiefly to the kunder surface of the trapezius, though it furnishes offsets to the levator anguli scapulaa and the cervical glands. b. The posterior scapular branch crosses under the levator anguli scapulae, and descends along the base of the scapula beneath the rhomboid muscles. If these muscles are divided, the artery will be seen to furnish branches to them, and to give small anastomotic twigs to both surfaces of the scapula. This branch arises very fre- quently from the third part of the subclavian trunk. The suprascapular and transverse cervical veins have the same course and branches as the arteries above described ; they open into the external jugular, near its junction with the subclavian vein. Nerve to the rhomboid muscles. This slender offset of the brachial plexus (p. 73) courses beneath the elevator of the angle of the scapida, and is distributed to the rhomboidei on the under surface. Before its termination it supplies one or two twigs to the elevator of the scapula. * Third Layer of Muscles. In this stratum are included the serratus posticus superior and inferior, and the splenius muscles. * Dissection. By reflecting the rhomboid muscles towards the spinous processes, and removing loose areolar tissue, the thin upper serratus muscle beneath them will be laid bare. The inferior serratus has been previously exposed by the reflection of the latissimus.389 SERRATI POSTIOI MUSCLES. Fig. 1-20.* relations. * The serrati muscles are very thin, and receive their name Serrati arc from their toothed attachment to the ribs. They are two in number, number, superior and inferior, and have aponeurotic origins from the spines of the vertebrae. *The serratus posticus superior (fig. 120, a) arises from the liga- g^Jgg".. mentum nuchas, and from the spinous processes of the last cervical, and upper two or three dorsal vertebrae, with the supraspinous liga- ment. The fleshy fibres are inclined down and out, and are inserted attach- by slips into four ribs, from the second to the fifth, external to their singles. The muscle rests on the splenius, and is co- vered by the rhomboidei «xcept at its upper border. * The serratus posticus inferior (fig. 119, g) is wider than the preceding •muscle. Its aponeurosis ■of origin is inseparably united with that of the latissimus dorsi, and with the fascia lumborum, and is connected to the spinous processes of the last two ■dorsal and upper two or three lumbar vertebrae. The fleshy fibres ascend isomewhat to be inserted into the last four ribs outside their angles, each ■.successive piece extending farther forwards than the ■one below. This muscle lies on the relations, mass of the erector spinae ; and with the upper border of its tendon the vertebral aponeurosis is united. Action. Both serrati are inspiratory muscles. The upper one use of raises the ribs into which it is inserted ; while the lower one draws serratl- backwards the lower ribs, and prevents their being carried upwards by the contraction of the diaphragm. The vertebral aponedrosis is a thin fascia which covers the vertebral fourth layer of muscles in the thoracic region. Internally it is ^g™u" attached to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Externally it is fixed to the angles of the ribs ; and in the intervals between the attach- bonee it joins the layer of connective tissue covering the intercostal ments • * Part of the third and fourth layers of the muscles of the back. a.

It is continuous below with the tendon of the serratus posticus inferior, and through this with the superficial layer of the fascia lumborum; but above, it passes beneath the upper serratus, and blends with the deep intermuscular fascia of the neck. The strongest fibres of the membrane are directed transversely. * Dissection. The upper serratus is to be cut through, and the vertebral aponeurosis taken away; and the part of the splenius muscle under the serratus should be cleaned. In turning outwards the fleshy part of the serratus, slender twigs of the intercostal nerves, which perforate the external intercostal muscle accompanied by small arteries, may be found entering its slips. The splenius muscle (fig. 120) is flat and elongated. Single at its origin, it is divided above into two parts, one passing to the head— splenius capitis, and the other to the neck—splenius colli. It arises from the upper six dorsal and the seventh cervical spines, and from vertebra, insertion. The splenius colli (c) is inserted by tendinous slips into the pos- terior transverse processes of the upper two or three cervical vertebrae with, but behind the attachment of the elevator of the angle of the scapula. The splenius capitis (b), much the larger, is inserted into the apex and hinder border of the mastoid process, and into the outer third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. This muscle is situate beneath the trapezius, the rhomboidei, and the serratus superior; and the insertion into the skidl is beneath the sterno-mastoid. The complexus muscle appears above the upjier border of the splenius capitis. Action, The cranial parts of both muscles will carry the head, directly back ; and one will incline and rotate the head to the same side. The splenius colli of both sides will bend back the upper cervical vertebrae ; but one muscle will turn the face to the same side, being able to rotate the head by its attachment to the transverse process- of the atlas. * Fourth Layer op Muscles. In this layer are included the erector spinse, with its divisions and accessory muscles to the necky and the complexus. Most of the vessels and nerves of the back are to be learnt with this layer of muscles. Dissection (fig. 121). To lay bare the complexus muscle in the neck, the splenius must be detached from the spinous processes, and thrown outwards. And while the erector spinas is being displayed in the dorsal and lumbar regions by the dissector of the upper limb, two prolongations from it to the cervical vertebras and the head are to be denned by the dissector of the neck:—One, a thin narrow muscle, the cervicalis ascendens, is continued beyond the ribs from the outer piece of the erector (ilio-costalis), and is to be separated from the muscles around. The other is a larger offset of the inner piece of the erector (longis-ERECTOR SPINiE. 391 sinius dorsi); single at first where it is united with the fibres of the longissimus, it is divided afterwards, like the splenius, into a cranial part (trachelo-mastoid) and a cervical part (transversalis colli). * The serratus inferior is to be detached from the spines and Show the thrown outwards, when fine nerves will be found entering it like and those to the upper muscle. The superficial layer of the fascia its divisions, lumborum is also to be removed, and the areolar tissue is to be cleaned from the surface of the large mass of the erector spinse wluch now comes into view. Opposite the last rib is an inter- muscular interval, which divides the erector spinse into an outer piece (ilio-costalis), and an inner (longissimus dorsi). By sinking iiio- the knife into this interval the sacro-lumbabs may be turned out- costa 1S: wards, so as to uncover the fleshy slips of its accessory muscle, which are fixed to the angles of the ribs : a muscular slip (cervicalis its offset to ascendens) is prolonged from this to the neck. * In preparing the ilio-costalis muscle, the external branches of the Vessels and nGrvBS. dorsal nerves with their accompanying arteries will appear. * The attachments of the longissimus dorsi are then to be traced jj1"^88^ out. Externally it has thin muscular slips of insertion into about the lower nine ribs, and thicker processes passing to the transverse outer processes of the lumbar vetebrse ; the latter may be shown by rais- ing the outer border of the erector, and clearing away the fat between it and the middle layer of the fascia lumborum. Internally the longissimus is inserted into the transverse processes of the dorsal, and inner and the accessory processes of the lumbar vertebrae by rounded "wertions; tendons; and to see these it will be necessary to detach a thin tendinous and muscular portion of the erector (spinalis dorsi) from spinalis the inner side of the longissimus, and to divide longitudinally the tlorsi '• part of the thick aponeurosis springuig from the lumbar spines, so as to separate the erector from the subjacent multifidus spinae. offsets to the From the longissimus, as from the ilio-costalis, a fleshy piece (trans- "eck" . versalis colli and trachelo-mastoid) is continued into the neck. * Between the longissimus and the multifidus spinas are the in- Vessels and ternal branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal and lumbar nerves- nerves, with offsets of the intercostal and lumbar vessels. * Erector Spots. This is the muscular mass on the side of the Erector spine, extending from the lower part of the sacrum to the head. It f£"?Js is single and pointed below, attains its greatest size in the loins, and below; on the thorax becomes divided into secondary portions to which special names are given. Its prolongations to the neck and head divided are very slender. On its posterior surface, in the lumbar and sacral above; regions, is a strong flat tendon of origin, from which most of the tendol*-*1 fleshy fibres spring. The muscle arises internally from the lower two or three dorsal, and all the lumbar and sacral spines; ex- origin. ternally from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest at the inner aspect; and inferiorly from the lower part of the back of the sacrum. Below the last rib it divides into the ilio-costalis and tf\ ' £<^_~^U~ longissimus dorsi; and in the thoracic region the spinalisHorsi is given off from the inner side of the latter part. * The ilio-costalis or sacro-lumbalis is derived from the outer ni0. costalis :DISSECTION OF THE BACK. 392 insertion.

Its fibres end in six or seven tendons, which are inserted into the angles of as many of the lower ribs. It is continued to the upper ribs and the neck by the two following muscles:— * The accessorius(nmsculus accessorius ad ilio-costaleni; rig. 120, d) arises by a series of tendinous and ileshy slips from the angles of the lower six ribs internal to the insertion of the ilio-costalis ; and it ends in tendons which are inserted into the remaining ribs in a line with the ilio-costalis, and into the transverse process of the seventh cervical vetebra. The cervicalis ascendens is a muscular slip prolonging the accessorius into the neck : it arises from four ribs, viz., the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the sixth, fifth, and fourth cervical vetebra). * The longissimus dorsi is the largest of the pieces resulting from the division of the erector spin®, and has two sets of insertions into the vertebrae and ribs. Internally it gives off a series of lleshy and tendinous bundles to the accessory processes of the lumbar vertebra;, and the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebra;: externally it is attached by thick fleshy slips to the transverse processes of the Lumbal vertebra;, and the middle layer of the fascia lumborum ; and by thin flattened processes to the ribs, except the first two or three, between the tuberosity and angle. Its muscular prolongation to the neck is united with the upper fleshy fibres, and splits into the two following pieces :— The transversalis colli (fig. 121, b) arises from the transverse processes of the upper dorsal vertebra; (from four to six), and is in- serted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebra; except the first and last The trachelo-mastoid muscle (transversalis capitis; fig. 121, c) arises in common with the preceding, and receives additional slips from the articular processes of the lower three or four cervical vertebra;. It is inserted beneath the splenitis capitis into the posterior margin of the mastoid process, where it is about three- quarters of an inch wide. * The spinalis dorsi is very narrow, and springs from the tendinous slips of the erector which arise from the lower dorsal and upper two or three lumbar spines. Its fibres are inserted into a variable number (from four to nine) of the upper dorsal spines. * Relations of the erector spina. The erector spinas is concealed by the muscles of the layers already examined. It lies over the semi- spinalis and multifidus spina; muscles, portions of the ribs and external intercostal muscles, and the levatores costarum. In the loins it is contained in an aponeurotic sheath of the fascia lum- borum (p. 386) ; and in the thoracic region a similar sheath is formed for the muscle by the vertebral aponeurosis with the ribs and dorsal vertebra;. The tendon of origin is united over the sacrum with the posterior layer of the fascia lumborum ; and from its outer border in this part some fibres of the gluteus maximus arise. The prolongations of the muscle in the neck lie between the393 ACTION OF ERECTOR SPINjE. splenitis and levator anguli scapulae on the outer side, and the com- plexus on the inner side, the trachelo-mastoid being next to the •eomplexus. The cervicalis ascendens is attached to the transverse processes in a line with the splenius colli, and immediately behind the middle and posterior scalene muscles. * Action of erector spituo. These powerful muscles draw backwards J^ofboth or extend the spine, and come into play in bringing the column Fig. 121.* into, and in maintaming the erect position. The parts inserted into the dorsal vertebrae will be to some extent inspiratory muscles, since the dilatation of the thorax is aided by extension of the verte- bral column ; but the slips inserted into the ribs will draw down- wards these bones, and may thus act in forced expiration.

Narrow at its lower end, the mnscle arises by tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the upper six dorsal and seventh cervical vertebras, and from the articu- lar processes of the succeeding cervical vertebras as high as the third : it is also joined in most cases by one or two slips from the lowest cervical or upper dorsal spines. The fleshy fibres pass upwards to be inserted into an impression between the curved lines of the occipital bone, which reaches outwards nearly two inches* from the external occipital crest. The inner part of the complexus, having two fleshy bellies with an intervening tendon, is often described separately as the biventer cervicis. Another tendinous intersection crosses the cutaneous surface of the muscle near the upper end. The complexus is concealed by the splenius and trapezius. Along the inner side is the semispinalis muscle, with the ligamentum nuchas. Beneath it are the small recti and obliqui muscles, the semispinalis, and the posterior cervical nerves and vessels ; and the cutaneous offsets of two or three of the nerves perforate it. Action. Both muscles will move the head directly back. One will draw the occiput down and back towards its own side. Dissection of vessels and nerves (fig. 122). In the neck the nerves and vessels will be brought into view by detaching the complexus from the occipital bone and the spines of the vertebras, and raising it carefully from the subjacent parts. Beneath the muscle are the ramifications of the cervical nerves, and the deep cervical and other vessels, surrounded by dense connective tissue. Each nerve, except the first, divides into an inner and an outer branch. Dissect out first the inner branches, which lie partly over and partly beneath the fibres of the semispinalis muscle (g). The external branches are very small, and are given off between the transverse processes close to where the trunks appear : they are to be looked for outside the complexus, entering the muscles prolonged from the erector spinas .and the splenius. The small first nerve is the most difficult of the set to find : it is a short trunk, contained in the interval between the recti and obliqui muscles near the head, and will be best found by looking for the small twigs furnished by it to the muscles around. The deep cervical artery is met with on the semispinalis muscle ; a part of the vertebral artery will be found in contact with the first nerve ; and the occipital artery will be visible crossing the occipital bone. * Opposite the thorax the dorsal nerves and vessels will be readily displayed on the inner side of the longissimus dorsi muscle, on the removal of a little fatty tissue from between the transverse pro- cesses. External and internal branches are to be traced from each nerve and vessel into the muscles : some of the former have been seen in the interval between the ilio-costalis and the longissimus dorsi.395 POSTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES. * The two branches of the lumbar nerves and vessels are in in the lam- the same line as the dorsal; but the inner set are difficult to find. ar regl0n- * The sacral nerves are placed beneath the multifidus spinse, and will be dissected after the examination of that muscle (p. 401). * Posterior Primary Branches of the Spinal Nerves.

The posterior supply the integuments and the muscles of the back, and are now to be learnt. In the neck. The posterior primary divisions of the cervical in the neck nerves are eight in number, and issue between the transverse pro- cesses ; but those of the first and second, which begin on the neural arches of the atlas and axis, appear above those arches. All, except they divide the first, divide into internal and external branches. except first. The external branches (fig. 121) are very small, and end in the External splenitis, and in the muscles prolonged from the erector spina?. are small The internal branches (fig. 122) are larger than the external ; they Intenial are directed towards the spinous processes, the lower three passing branches: beneath the semispinalis, and the upper four over that muscle. By the side of the spines cutaneous branches are furnished to the neck jj"^,^® and the head by the nerves that are superficial to the semispinalis : offsets, these cutaneous offsets ascend to the surface through the splenitis, the complexus, and the trapezius muscles, and are distributed as before seen (p. 382). In their course the nerves supply the surrounding muscles, viz., complexus, semispinalis, multifidus spina?, and inter- spinales. The cutaneous branches of the second and third nerves reach the head, and require a separate notice. That of the second nerve (fig. 122,;), named great occipital, ap- Second pears beneath the inferior oblique muscle, to which it gives offsets, head™'* and is directed upwards through the complexus and trapezius to end on the occiput (p. 8). The branch of the third nerve (fig. 122,3), becoming superficial ™™}ies near the middle line, gives an offset upwards to the lower part of neck and the occiput, internal to the preceding (p. 382). This nerve usually head- joins the great occipital twice, viz., beneath the complexus and superficial to the trapezius. The posterior primary division of the suboccipital or first spinal First nerve nerve (fig. 122,1) is very short, and appears in the interval between the recti and obliqui muscles. In passing from the spinal canal it » is placed between the arch of the atlas and the vertebral artery.

The vessels now dissected are the Vessels, occipital and the deep cervical arteries, a small part of the vertebral, and the posterior branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries of the aorta. Veins accompany the artenes. The occipital artery (fig. 122, a) courses along the occipital Part of the bone. Appearing from beneath the digastric muscle, the vessel is artery1*1 directed backwards under the sterno-mastoid, the splenius, and usually the trachelo-mastoid, but over the obliquus superior and complexus muscles. Behind the insertion of the sterno-mastoid it becomes superficial, and ascends to the occiput, where it is dis- tributed (p. (5). It supplies the surrounding muscles, and gives the which following branch to the neck :— gives a The cervical branch (b) distributes twigs to the splenius and cervical - trapezius, and passing beneath the complexus, anastomoses with the ran vertebral and deep cervical arteries. The vertebral artery (fig. 122, c) lies ontheneural arch of the Part; of the atlas, behind the articulating process, and appears in the interval artery™' between the straight and oblique muscles. Beneath it is the suboccipital nerve. Small branches are given to the surrounding muscles, and to anastomose with the contiguous arteries. The deep cervical artery (fig .122, e) is a branch of the superior Deep cervi- intercostal of the subclavian (p. 71). Passing back between the ^ artery' transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the tirst rib, it ascends between the complexus and semispinalis muscles, as high as the upper border of the latter, and anastomoses with the cervical branch of the occipital artery. The contiguous muscles receive branches from it, and anastomoses are formed between its offsets and those of the vertebral. * The POSTERIOR BRANCHES OF THE INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES (p. 364) Dorsal pass back between the vertebra? and the ascending costo-transverse ^uttoto™ ligament, and divide like the nerves into inner and outer pieces. * The internal branches end in the fleshy mass of the multifidus inner and398 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. outer branches, and give a spinal branch.

Like the nerves, the lowest branches of this set are the largest and extend to the surface. As the dorsal branch of the intercostal artery passes by the inter- vertebral foramen, it furnishes a small intraspinal artery to the spinal canal (p. 414). * The POSTERIOR BRANCHES OF THE LUMBAR ARTERIES divide, like the foregoing, into internal and external pieces, as soon as they reach the interval between the erector and multifidus spina;. Each gives also a spinal branch to the spinal canal. * The internal brandies are small, and end in the midtifidus spinas. * The external b-anches supply the erector spinas ; and offsets are continued to the integuments with the superficial nerves. Veins. The occipital veins communicate usually with the lateral sinus of the skull through the mastoid foramen, and pass beiieath the complexus to enter the deep cervical vein. The deep cervical vein is of large size, and besides receiving the occipital veins, communicates with the other deep veins of this region, forming the posterior plexus of the neck. It passes forwards with its artery between the transverse processes, and joins the vertebral vein. The vertebral vein begins above the neural arch of the atlas by the union of an offset leaving the spinal canal with the artery and branches from the above-mentioned plexus. * The dorsal and lumbar veins agree in their branching and distri- bution with the arteries they accompany, and end in the corresjiond- ing trunks of the thoracic and abdominal wall. In contact with the spinous processes and laminas of the vertebrae is a deeper set of veins (dorsal spinal), which anastomose freely together, and communicate through the ligamenta subflava with the veins in the interior of the spinal canal. * Fifth Layer of Muscles. In this layer are included the small recti and oblicpri of the head, the transverso-spinales, the inter- spinales, and the intertransversales. Dissection. Most of the remaining muscles of the back have been uncovered by the previous dissections. Between the first two vertebras and. the occipital bone are the straight and oblique muscles. * Between the erector spinse and the spines of the vertebras are the transverso-spinales, and internal to these the small interspinales. The intertransverse muscles of the lumbar region will be exposed by removing the erector spinas. The rectus capitis posticus major (fig. 122, a) arises from the side of the spinous process of the axis, and is inserted into the outer part of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone for about an inch, as well as into the surface below it. The muscle is covered by the complexus, and at its insertion by399 SUBOCCIPITAL MUSCLES. the obliquus superior.

The origin of the muscle is beneath the trachelo-mastoid, and its relations; insertion beneath the complexus. In the interval between these it is covered by the splenius. It lies over the vertebral artery and the insertion of the rectus posticus major. Action. With its fellow the upper oblique will assist in carrying and use backwards the head. By the action of one muscle the head will be inclined backwards, and to the same side. Suboccipital triangle (fig. 122). This name is given to the small Triangular space which is bounded below by the obliquus inferior muscle, and tween the above by the rectus posticus major on the inner side, and the musoles: obliquus superior on the outer sifie. It is covered by the com- plexus ; and its floor is formed by the neural arch of the atlas, with the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament. In it are seen a small contents, part of the vertebral artery, and the posterior branch of the sub- occipital nerve. * Transverso-Spinales. Occupying the vertebral groove by the Tnmsverso- side of the spinous processes is a long muscular mass, which extends sPinalcs: from the lower part of the sacrum to the axis. This is composed of slips which are directed obliquely from tranverse or articular pro- arrange- cesses to spinous processes, and are therefore designated collectively ment' transverso-spinales. The slips differ in length, and form three layers, which are described as separate muscles, viz., a superficial and sub- stratum of long slips, confined to the cervical and dorsal regions— Uivisi,ms-DISSECTION OF TJ1E BACK. 400 Semispinalia is divided into semispinalia dorsi and semispi- nalis colli.

The semispinalis colli (fig. 122, g) arises from the transverse processes of the upper six dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the- spines of the cervical vertebra? above the last, the atlas not receiving any slip. Dissection. The upper part of the mnltifidus spina? is to be prepared by the dissector of the head and neck. It will be exposed by cutting through the insertion of the semispinalis, and turning aside that muscle. * Over the sacrum the thick aponeurosis of the erector spina*- must be removed. In the dorsal region the multifidus spina? will appear on detaching and reflecting the semispinalis from the spines. The slips by which the muscle is attached to the processes of the? vertebras should be defined and separated. * The multifidus sriiwE reaches from the sacrum to the axis : iti is larger below than above, and is smallest in the upper dorsal region. It takes origin at the pelvis from the back of the sacrum between the spines and the external row of processes as low as the fourth aperture, from the posterior sacro-iliac ligament, from the inner side of the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and from the- overlying tendon of the erector spina?; in the loins it arises by large fasciculi from the mamillary processes of the vertebra? ; in the dorsal region by thinner slips from the transverse processes ; and in the neck from the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebra. From these attachments the fibres are directed obliquely upwards and inwards, passing over from one to three vertebra, to be inserted into the spinous processes from the axis to the last lumbar vertebra. * Dissection. To see the rotatores dorsi the slips of the multifidus should be detached from the dorsal spines and turned downwards. * The rotatores dorsi are eleven short muscular slips in the- dorsal region beneath the multifidus spina?, from which they are- separated by fine areolar tissue. Each 'arises from the upper and back part of a transverse process, and is inserted into the lower border of the neural arch of the vertebra next above. The first springs from the transverse process of the second vertebra. * The transverso-spinales are entirely concealed by the erector spina? and complexus muscles ; and beneath them are the lamina? of the vertebra?, with the dorsal spinal plexus of veins. Internally they rest against the spinous processes and the interspinal muscles. * Action. The transverso-spinales of the two sides acting together401 INTERSPINOUS AND INTERTRANSVERSE MUSCLES. will extend the spine ; and the muscles of one side can rotate the column in the cervical and dorsal regions, turning the face in the opposite direction. * Dissection. The multifidus spinas is now to be separated from Dissection, the cervical and lumbar spines to show the interspinal muscles. * The interspinales are arranged in pairs in the intervals interspinal between the spinous processes. They are most developed in the musclcs ■ neck and loins. In the cervical region the muscles are small rounded bundles .in neck; attached to the bifurcated extremities of the spines from the axis downwards. * In the dorsal region interspinal muscles are only present in one in dorsal or two of the liighest and lowest spaces. * In the lumbar region they are thin flat muscles, reaching the ™ loins; •whole length of the spines, one on each side of the interspinous ligament.

In the neck they are double, and resemble the interspinal muscles in neck; of the cervical vertebras (p. 171). * In the dorsal region they are single rounded bundles of smallin dorsal size, and are found only between the four or five lower vertebrae. regl0n' They are represented in the middle spaces by thin fibrous bands, which constitute the so-called intertransverse ligaments (p. 379). * In the lumbar region there are two muscles in each space. The in loins; outer set are thin flat muscles between the transverse processes. The inner muscles are rounded bundles in a line with those of the dorsal region; they are attached to the accessory processes above, and the mamillary processes below ; and the highest is between the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. Action. The intertransverse muscles assist in bending the spine their use. laterally. * Dissection (fig. 123). To see the posterior divisions of the Dissection sacral nerves, it will be necessary to remove the part of the "e^™1 multifidus spinae covering the sacrum. The upper three nerves are split into two each ; their external branches will be found readily on the great sacro-sciatic ligament, from which they may be traced inwards ; the inner branches are very slender and difficult to find. The lower two nerves are very small, and do not divide like the others. They are to be sought on the back of the sacrum, below the attachment of the multifidus spinae. The fourth comes through a sacral aperture, and the fifth between the sacrum and coccyx. The coccygeal nerve is still lower, by the side of the coccyx. * Sacral nerves (fig. 123).

Cord is con- tained in spinal canal, invested by membranes. Dissection to show the cord and the membranes. Spinal meninges are three in number. Dura mater surrounds cord loosely; lower end- ing; size of sheath; connec- tions ; onsets on nerves ; The spinal cord (medulla spinalis) gives origin to the spinal nerves, and is lodged in the canal bounded by the bodies and neural arches of the vertebra. It is invested by prolongations of the membranes of the brain, which form sheaths around and support it. Dissection. After all the muscles have been taken from the arches and spines of the vertebra, the spinal canal is to be opened by sawing through the laminae on each side, close to the articular processes; and the cuts of the saw should extend to the lower end of the sacrum, but not higher in the neck than the fourth cervical vertebra. As it is difficult to use the saw in the hollow of the lumbar region, a chisel and a mallet will be found useful to complete the division of the neural arches. The tube of the dura mater is covered by some veins and fat, and by a loose areolar tissue containing fluid sometimes, especially at the lower part. The fat may be scraped away with the handle of the scalpel; and the lateral prolongations of the membrane through the intervertebral foramina are to be defined. Membranes op the Cord (fig. 125). Three membranes, like those on the brain, surround the cord, viz., an external tube of dura mater, an internal covering of pia mater, and an intermediate sheath of arachnoid. The dura mater (a) is the strongest tube, and is continuous with the membrane lining the interior of the skull. It forms a loose sheath (theca) along the spinal canal as far as the last lumbar vertebra ; and then tapering gradually it ends opposite the third piece of the sacrum in a slender impervious cord which is continued to the back of the coccyx (fig. 124, h). The capacity of the sheath greatly exceeds the dimensions of the cord ; and it is larger in the neck and loins than in the dorsal region. On the outer aspect the spinal dura mater is smooth, in com- parison with that in the skull, for it does not act as a periosteum to the bones. Between it and the wall of the canal are some vessels and fat; and it is connected to the posterior common ligament of the vertebrae by a few fibrous bands. On each side the dura mater sends offsets along the spinal nerves in the intervertebral foramina ; and these offsets become gradually longer below (fig. 124), where they form tubes which enclose the sacral nerves,405 SPINAL DURA MATER. and lie for some distance within the spinal canal. In the centre median between the lowest offsets on the nerves, is the slender fibrous cord process. (6), which blends with the periosteum covering the back of the C° iWtfon. To remove the spinal cord with the sheath of the dura mater from the body, the lateral processes in the intervertebral cord, Fig. 124. Fig. 125.t foramina, with the contained nerves, are to be cut; and one or two of them in the dorsal region should be followed outwards beyond the apertures by cutting away the surrounding bone. The central prolongation may be now detached from the coccyx; and the cord and its membranes are to be divided opposite the fourth cervical * Lower end of the dura mater -with its central and lateral processes.

Pia mater supports the cord, gives offsets. Fibrous bands. vertebra, and to be removed by cutting the bands that attach the dura mater to the posterior common ligament. When the cord is taken out, place the anterior surface uppermost, with the lateral offsets widely separated. To show the arachnoid covering, the dura mater is to be slit along the middle as far as tin- small terminal fibrous cord before referred to ; but the membrane is to be raised while it is being cut through, so that the loose arach- noid on the cord may not be injured. Lastly fasten back the dura mater with pins. The inner surface of the dura mater is now seen to be smooth and shining, and everywhere free except at the spots along each side where it is perforated by the nerves, and gives attachment to the processes of the ligamentum denticulatum. The cavity between the dura mater and the arachnoid is named the subdural space. The arachnoid (fig. 125, b) is the thin translucent covering of the cord immediately beneath the dura mater. It surrounds the cord loosely, so as to leave a considerable interval between the two, called the subarachnoid space. The loose sheath is largest at its lower part, where it envelops the mass of nerves forming the cauda equina. Around the roots of each nerve the arachnoid forms a short tube, which is lost as they perforate the dura mater. Dissection. The subarachnoid space may be made evident by placing the handle of the scapel beneath the membrane, or by put- ting a piece of the cord in the water and blowing air between the arachnoid and pia mater. The subarachnoid space separates the arachnoid membrane from the spinal cord invested by the pia mater. It is larger below than above, and is occupied by the cerebrospinal fluid. Superiorly it is continuous with the cranial subarachnoid space ; and through this it communicates with the cavity in the interior of the brain by means of an aperture in the roof of the fourth ventricle (p. 181). Along the back of the cord the space is imperfectly divided by a median partition (septum posticum) composed of bundles of fibrous tissue, which is most developed in the neck. Similar fine tra- becular pass between the posterior nerve-roots and the arachnoid. The subarachnoid space also contains the serrations of the ligamen- tum denticulatum, and the roots of the spinal nerves, with some vessels. Dissection. In order to see the next covering of the cord, with the ligamentum denticttlatum, the arachnoid membrane is to be taken away ; and two or three of the anterior roots of the upper dorsal nerves may be cut throxigh and reflected, as in fig. 125. The pia mater (fig. 125, h) is much less vascular on the spinal cord than on the brain. Thicker and more fibrous in its nature, the membrane closely surrounds the cord with a sheath, and sends a thin fold into the anterior median fissure : it furnishes coverings to the roots of the spinal nerves. The outer surface of the pia mater is rough. Along the front is a median fibrous band (linea splendens, Haller ; fig. 125, g) ; and on each side another fibrous band, the ligamentum denticulatum, isSPINAL PIA MATER. 407 attached to it. In the cervical region the membrane has usually a rather dark colour, due to the presence of pigment-cells in it. Where the spinal cord ceases, viz., about the lower edge of the it ends body of the first lumbar vertebra, the sheath of the pia mater con- SmalT fibrous tracts, and gives rise to a slender thread-like prolongation, the gjj^jj filum terminate or central ligament of the cord (fig. 127, d). This terminale. contains a little nervous substance in its upper part; and below, it blends with the central imperviovis process of the dura mater. A vein and artery accompany the filum terminale, and distinguish it from the surrounding nerves. The ligamentum denticulatum (fig. 125, c) is a white, fibrous band The dentate on each side of the spinal cord, and has received its name from its usament serrated appearance. It serves to support the cord, which is fixed by it to the sheath of the dura mater. Situate between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, the is fixed on band reaches upwards to the beginning of the medulla oblongata, °ord!lde and ends below on the pointed extremity of the cord. Internally it is united to the pia mater. Externally it ends in a series of tri- angular or tooth-like projections (d), which are fixed at intervals into the dura mater, each being about midway between the aper- and on other tures of the roots of the spinal nerves.

The pia mater has a network of vessels in its substance, though of pia mater, this is less marked here than on the brain ; and from them offsets enter the cord. In the membrane are many nerves derived from the sympathetic and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. Dissection. The arachnoid membrane is to be taken away on one Dissection side ; and the nerve-roots are to be traced outwards to their trans- nerves*3 °f mission through apertures in the dura mater. One of the offsets of the dura mater, which has been cut of some and the length, is to be laid open to expose the contained ganglion. The gailslion- student should define the ganglion, showing its bifid condition at the inner end (fig. 126 b), and should trace a bundle of threads of the posterior root into each point. The anterior root, consisting also of two bundles of threads, is to be followed over the ganglion to its union with the posterior root beyond the ganglion. Spinal Nerves. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves ; and Trunks of each nerve is constructed by the blending of two roots (anterior and posterior) in the intervertebral foramen (fig. 126). They are divided into groups corresponding with the regional Number and subdivisions of the spinal column, viz., cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sro"l>s- sacral, and coccygeal. In each group the nerves are the same in408 THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. Relation of nerves to vertebrae. Primary divisions. Roots, anterior and posterior.

The cervical nerves from the first to the seventh pass out above the several vertebra; and the eighth Fig. 126 * *8 below ^e lasfc cervical vertebra ; the succeeding nerves are placed each below its corresponding ver- tebra. Each nerve divides into two primary branches, anterior and posterior ; the former of these is distributed to the front of the body and the limbs ; and the latter is confined to the hinder part of the trunk. EOOTS OP THE NERVES (fig. 126). Two roots (anterior and posterior) attach the nerve to the spinal cord; and these unite together to form a common trunk in the intervertebral foramen. The posterior root is marked by a ganglion, but the anterior root is aganglionic. The posterior or ganglionic roots (fig. 126, b) are larger than the anterior, and are formed by thicker and more numerous fibrils. They are attached to the side of the cord between the posterior and lateral columns in a straight line, which they keep even to the last nerve. In their course to the trunk of the nerve the fibrils converge to an aperture in the dura mater, opposite the intervertebral foramen ; as they approach that aperture they are collected into two bundles (fig. 126 B, b) which, lying side by side, receive a sheath from the dura mater, and enter the two points of the intervertebral ganglion. The intervertebral ganglion (fig. 126, c) is reddish in colour, and oval in shape ; and its size is proportioned to that of the root. By means of the previous dissection, the ganglion may be seen to be bifid at the inner end (fig. 126 b), where it is joined by the bundles of filaments of the root (6) ; or the root might be said to possess two * A.

Sometimes the first or suboccipital nerve is without a ganglion. The anterior or aganglionic roots (fig. 126 a, a) arise from the side ^^or of the spinal cord by filaments which are attached irregularly—not without in a straight line, and approach near the middle fissure at the lower 8aI1sll0n> «nd of the cord. Taking the same direction as the posterior root to the inter- Jjj^ace^ater vertebral foramen, the fibrils enter a distinct opening in, and have and joins a separate sheath of, the dura mater. In their farther course to the j£$^£nd trunk of the nerve they are gathered into two bundles (fig. 126 b, a), ganglion, and pass over the ganglion without joining it. Finally, the anterior root blends with the posterior beyond the ganglion, to form the trunk. Characters of the roots. Besides variations in the relative size of Characters the two roots, the following characters are to be noted :— Union of the fibrils. The fibrils of contiguous anterior roots may Some sets be intermingled, and the fibrils of the neighbouring posterior roots j^.r may be connected in a bike manner ; but the anterior is never mixed with the posterior root. Size of tlie roots to each other. The posterior root is larger than ^°o8t®™" the anterior, except in the suboccipital nerve ; and the number of the filaments is also greater. Farther, the posterior is proportion- proportion- ally larger in the cervical than in any other group ; in the dorsal in'neck?68* nerves there is but a very slight difference in favour' of the hinder root. Size of both roots along tlie cord. Both roots are larger where the Itoots are nerves for the limbs arise than at any other part of the cord ; and Jj^^fg o?r they are largest in the nerves to the lower limbs. They are limbs, smallest at the lower extremity of the cord. Direction and length of the roots. As the apertures of transmission Oblique in from the spinal canal are not generally opposite the place of origin their course' of the nerves, the roots are for the most part directed obliquely. This obliquity increases from above down; for in the upper cervical nerves the roots are horizontal; but in the lumbar and most so .sacral nerves they have a vertical direction around the filumlufenorlv' terminale (fig. 127) ; and the bundle of long nerve-roots descending where they from the end of the spinal cord is named, from its resemblance to a equina*"1111 horse's tail, the cauda equina. The length of the roots increases in proportion to their obliquity. Length in- Thus, the distance between the origin and the place of exit of the abOTedown1 roots of the lowest cervical nerve equals the depth of one vertebra; in the lowest dorsal nerve it amounts to the depth of two vertebra? ; and in the lumbar and sacral nerves each succeeding root becomes nearly a vertebra longer, for the cord does not reach beyond the first lumbar vertebra.

The roots of the first two cervical nerves join on the neural arches of the corresponding vertebra); and the anterior and poste- rior primary branches diverge from the trunks in that situation. In the sacral nerves the union of the roots takes place within the spinal canal; and the primary branches of the nerves issue by the apertures on the front and back of the sacrum. The roots of the coccygeal nerve are also united in the spinal canal; and the anterior and posterior branches of its trunk escape by the lower aperture of that canal. Sit uation of the ganglia. The .ganglia are placed commonly in the intervertebral foramina, but where the position of these apertures is irregular, as at the upper and lower extremities of the spinal column, they have the following situation:—In the first two nerves they lie on the neural arches of the atlas and axis. In the sacral nerves they are contained in the spinal canal; and in the coccygeal nerve the ganglion is usually within the sac of the dura mater. Vessels op the spinal cord. The arteries on the surface of the cord are anterior and posterior spinal. The anterior spinal artery occupies the middle line of the cord beneath the fibrous band before alluded to in that position. It begins by the union of two small branches of the vertebral artery (p. 182) ; and it is continued to the lower end of the cord by a series of anastomotic branches, which are derived from the vertebral and ascending cervical arteries in the neck, and from the intercostal arteries in the dorsal region. Inferiorly it supplies the roots of the nerves forming the cauda equina, and ends on the central fibrous prolongation of the cord. The branches of this artery ramify in the pia mater, some entering the median fissure. The posterior spinal arteries, one on each side, are continued from the upper to the lower part of the cord, behind the roots of the nerves. These vessels are furnished from the same source as the anterior (p. 182), and their continuity is maintained by a series of anastomotic offsets, which enter the canal along the spinal nerves. Dividing into small branches, the vessels of opposite sides form a free anastomosis around the posterior roots, and some twigs enter the posterior septa of the cord. The veins of the spinal cord are very tortuous and form a plexus on the surface. At intervals larger trunks arise, which accompany the spinal nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and end in the veins outside the spinal canal. Near the top of the cord the veins are united into two or more small branches, which, communicating with the intraspinal veins, join in the skull the inferior cerebellar veins, or the inferior petrosal sinuses. The spinal CORD (medulla spinalis) is the elongated rounded part of the cerebro-spinal centre, which is enclosed within the spinal canal. Invested by the membranes before examined, the cord occupies about two-thirds of the length of its canal, and is much smaller than the bony case surrounding it.411 of the Extent varies below, 127.1 and in the embryo. Length. Inferior termination in the adult. Two swellings on it. EXTEENAL CHARACTERS OF CORD. The extent of the spinal cord is from the lower margin foramen magnum of the occipital bone to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, but its termination inferiorly may be a little higher or lower than that spot. In the embryo before the third month the medulla reaches the whole length of the spinal canal; but it .n-adually recedes as the surrounding bones enlarge faster than it, until it takes the posi- tion ft has in the adult. Its length is usually from sixteen to eighteen inches. Above, the cord joins the medulla oblon- gata ; and below, it ends in a small taper- ing part (conus medullaris), from which the filuni termhiale (fig. 127, d) is continued downwards. The lower end of the conus medullaris is sometimes marked by one or two irregular swellings. The size of the spinal cord is much increased wbere the nerves of the limbs are attached. There are, therefore, two enlargements on it, viz., cervical and lumbar ; the one in the neck reaches from the first cervical to the first dorsal -vertebra ; the other is smaller, and is on a level with the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebra. In the upper enlargement the greatest thickness is from side to side ; but in the lower swelling the measurement from before back nearly equals the transverse. While the pia mater remains on the cord, the anterior surface is distinguished from the posterior by the central fibrous band and the anterior spinal artery; as well as by the irregular line of the anterior nerve-roots, which approach the middle towards the lower end. Dissection. For the examination of the struc- ture the student will require a piece of a fresh cord which has been hardened in spirit; for the cord which is obtained from the spinal canal at this period is not fitted for the purpose of dissection. Supposing the pia mater removed from the surface, with the roots of the nerves left on one side, the student will be able to observe the following divisions of the cord. Sulci of the cord (fig. 128).

'Die cord is divided into antero- lateral column, its whole length, and penetrates about one-third of the thickness of the medulla. It is lined by a fold of the pia mater, and is deepest towards the lower end of the cord. White medullary substance bounds the fissure ; and at the bottom of it the white fibres are transverse, and are separated by apertures for blood-vessels. Along the back of the cord, also in the middle line, there is a narrow groove, from which a process of the pia mater called the posterior median septum extends forwards nearly to the centre of the medulla, separating the nervous substance of the right and left halves. Vessels of the posterior surface of the cord enter in the septum. The lateral furrow (fig. 128, cl) is a shallow groove along the line of attachment of the fasciculi of the posterior roots. Between the posterior median and the lateral grooves another slight furrow, the posterior intermediate, may be seen in the upper part of the cord (fig. 128, e). Divisions of the Cord. Each half of the cord between the median sulci is divided into two by the lateral furrow (fig. 128, d) ; the part in front of that groove and the posterior roots of the nerves is called the antero - lateral column (a) ; and the part behind, the posterior column (6). The antero - lateral column (fig. 128, a) includes rather more than Fig. 128. two-thirds of the half of the cord, extending backwards to the posterior roots of the nerves, and gives attachment to the anterior roots (7c). This pail of the cord is sometimes described as consist- ing of anterior and lateral columns, the two being separated by the anterior roots of the nerves, posterior The posterior column (fig. 128, b) is situate between the lateral column, furrow (d), with the posterior roots of the nerves (J), and the with median posterior median septum. In the cervical region, the posterior and external intermediate sulcus (e) marks off a small inner portion, which is named the posterior median column (c) ; and the remainder is then distinguished as the postero-external column (b). A narrow central piece, the commissure of the cord, unites the halves between the anterior median fissure and the posterior median septum. Cord con- Composition OF the cobd (fig. 128).

The same cut demonstrates the existence of a mass of grey matter in the interior, which is arranged in the form of two crescents (one in each half), united by a cross piece, and surrounded by white substance. The commissure consists of two parts, viz., a transverse band of grey matter (fig. 128, h), with a white stratum in front. The grey transverse band (posterior or grey commissure) connects the opposite crescents, and is placed rather nearer the front than the back of the cord. In its centre is the shrunken canal of the spinal cord (fig. 128, i), which is beet seen in the foetus. It reaches the whole length of the medulla, and a cross section of the cord shows it as a round spot. Above, the canal opens on the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and below, it is continued into the filum terminale. It is lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium, and is obstructed by a granular material near the upper end. The anterior or white commissure is best marked opposite the en- largements on the cord, and is least developed in the dorsal region. TJie Iwlf of the medulla. In the half of the cord, as in the com- missure, grey and white portions exist; the former is elongated from before back, being crescentic in shape as before said, and is quite surrounded by the latter. The grey crescent (fig. 128, g) has its extremities or cornua directed towards the roots of the nerves, and the convexity to the middle line. The crescentic masses in the opposite halves of the cord are xuiited by the grey com- missure. The posterior cornu is long and slender (fig. 129), and reaches nearly to the surface along the lateral fissure. It is rather narrow at its base (cervix ; T), and enlarged towards its extremity (caput;'), where it is surmounted by a semi-trans- parent layer which has been named the substantia gelatinosa (s). There is also on the inner side of the cervix of the posterior cornu a special portion of grey matter containing nerve-cells, the posterior vesicular column of Clarke (8), which is most developed in the lower dorsal region. The anterim- cornu (fig. 129,2) is shorter and thicker than the posterior, and projects towards the anterior roots without reaching the surface. Its end has an irregular or zigzag outline A third smaller projection of the grey matter is seen in the upper part of the dorsal region of the cord, on the outer side of the crescent between the anterior and posterior horns : this is known as the inter- mediate process (Gowers) or the lateral cornu (fig. 129,6). * Outline of the grey substance in the spinal cord npar th» mlAM* „f «. do.al region (Lockhart Clarke). 1 Capu't posteriori cornu. 3.

The white substance of (lie cord is composed chiefly of medullated nerve-fibres disposed in longitudinal bundles, which are enclosed by irregular septa of connective tissue prolonged from the pia mater on the surface. Three larger processes of the pia mater extend into the back of the cord ; these are the posterior median septum already referred to, and the posterior intermediate septum on each side, which passes forwards in the cervical region from the furrow of the same name, and separates the posterior median and postero-external columns.

The grey substance is least in amount in the dorsal region. The comua of the grey crescents decrease in length from above down, especially the posterior, and towards the end of the cord they blend in one indented or cruciform mass. Intraspinal Vessels. Arteries supply the cord and its mem- branes, and the bodies of the vertebrae. The veins form a remark- able plexus within the canal, but this will not be seen unless they have been specially injected.

They are distributed after the following plan :— As each artery enters the spinal canal by the intervertebral fora- ^'^^J^™ men, it divides into two branches, upper and lower. From the bra; point of division the branches are directed, one (b) upwards and the other (c) downwards, behind the bodies of the two contiguous . vertebra, and join in anastomotic loops with an offset of the intra- spinal artery above and below. From the loops offsets (d) are by loops; furnished to the periosteum and the bodies of the vertebra?. Anas- tomotic twigs connect the arches across the vertebrae. The intraspinal vessels produce also a central longitudinal artery (e), and a cen- like that on the front of the spinal cord, which lies on thetral vessel- bodies of the vertebrae, and is reinforced at intervals by offsets from the loops. The intraspinal veins (fig. 131) consist of two anterior longitu-intraspinal dinal vessels, which extend the whole length of the spinal canal ; of Jae™e.are veins inside the bodies of the vertebra? ; and of a plexus of veins beneath the neural arches. The anterior longitudinal veins (b) are close to the bodies of the Anterior vertebrae, one on each side of the posterior common ligament; and ^ on bodies they are irregular in outline, owing to certain constrictions near the of vertebra:, intervertebral foramina. They receive opposite the body of each vertebra the veins (c) from that bone ; and through the inter- vertebral foramina they have branches of communication (a) with the veins outside the spine in the neck, the dorsal region, the loins, and the pelvis. Veins of the bodies of the vertebrm. Within the channels in the Veins of the bodies of the vertebra? are large veins, which join on the front of the vertebne- bone with veins in that situation. Towards the back of the vertebra they are united in an arch, from which two trunks issue by the large apertures on the posterior surface. Escaped from the bone, the trunks diverge to the right and left, and open into the longitudinal veins. The posterior spinal veins form a plexus between the dura mater Posterior and the arches of the vertebra?. A large vein may be said to lie on areln'con-8 each side of the middle line, which joins freely with its fellow, and tact with with the anterior longitudinal vein by lateral branches. Offsetsarches- from these vessels are directed through the intervertebral foramina, to end in the veins (a) at the roots of the transverse processes.CHAPTER VII. DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. Section I. PEKINEUM OF THE MALE. Before the dissection pass cathe- ter. Place the body in position, and fasten upwards the legs. The surface limits. The anus, the raphe", hollow on side of anus, and folds and veins around that opening. Directions. The perineum may be allotted with greatest advan- tage to the dissector of the abdomen ; and its examination should he made first, as the distinctness of many of the parts is destroyed soon after death. Before the body is placed in the position suited for the dissection, the student may practise passing the catheter along the urethra. Position of the body. While the body lies on the back it is to be drawn to the end of the dissecting table, till the buttocks project slightly over the edge ; and a block is to be placed beneath the pelvis, to raise the perineum to a convenient height. The legs are to be raised and kept out of the way by the following means :— After the knees have been bent, and the thighs raised upon the trunk, the limbs are to be fastened with a cord in their bent position. For this purpose make one or two turns with the cord round one bent knee (say the right); carry the cord beneath the table, and, encircling the opposite limb in the same manner, fasten it finally round the right knee. When the position has been arranged, let the student raise the scrotum, and place a small piece of cotton-wool or tow within the anus, but without distending the rectum. Superficial limits and marking. The perineal space in the male is limited, on the surface of the body, by the scrotum in front, and by the thighs and buttocks on the sides and behind. The skin of this region is of a dark colour, and is covered with hairs. In the middle line is the aperture of the anus, which is behind a line extending from the anterior part of the one ischial tuberosity to the other. In front of the anus the surface is slightly convex over the urethra, and presents a longitudinal prominent line or raphe, which divides the space into halves. Between the anus and the tuberosity of the hip-bone the surface is somewhat depressed over the hollow of the subjacent ischio-rectal fossa, especially in emaciated bodies. The margin of the anal aperture possesses numerous converging folds, but these are more or less obliterated by the position of the body and the distension of the anus; and projecting oftentimesBOUNDARIES OF THE PERINEUM. 417 through and around the opening are some dilated veins (haemor- rhoids). Deep boundaries. The deep boundaries of the perineal space will ^"g^ be ascertained, in the progress of the dissection, to correspond with as those of the inferior aperture or the outlet of the pelvis. The limits may Jj^J of be seen on a dry or prepared pelvis, on which the ligaments remain entire; and the student should trace on the body the several boundaries with his finger. In front is the symphysis pubis ; and at the back is the tip of the coccyx, with the great gluteal muscles. On each side in front is the portion of the hip-bone which bounds the subpubic arch, viz., from the pubic symphysis to the ischial tuberosity; and farther back is the great sacro-sciatic ligament extending from the tuberosity to the coccyx. This region sinks into the outlet of the pelvis as far as the recto-vesical fascia, which forms its floor. Form and size. The interval included within the boundaries above Form of the said is rather heart-shaped, owing to the projection of the coccyx nl'easure"1 behind; and it measures over the surface about four inches from meats, before backwards, and three and a half inches between the ischial tuberosities. Depth. The depth of the perineum from the surface to the floor Depth of may be said to be generally about three inches between the anus the space" and the ischial tuberosity, but this measurement varies greatly in different bodies; and it amounts to about an inch at the fore part, between the pubic bones. Division. A line from the front of the tuberosity of one side to A line be- the corresponding point on the other will divide the perineal space hTbeTosities into two parts. The anterior half (urethral) contains the root of the divides it penis and the urethra, with their muscles, and vessels and nerves. °' The posterior half (rectal) is occupied by the lower end of the large intestine, with its muscles, &c. POSTERIOR HALF OK THE SPACE. This portion of the perineal space contains the lower end of the Contents rectum, surrounded by its elevator muscles and the muscles acting j* ,afnal on the anus. The gut does not occupy, however, the whole of the ' interval between the pelvic bones ; for on each side is a space, the and t,,eir ischiorectal fossa, in which is contained much loose fat, with the yosSon. vessels and nerves for the supply of the end of the gut. Dissection (fig. 132). The skin is to be raised from this part of Dissection the perineum by the following cuts:—One is to be made across the perineum at the front of the anus, and is to extend rather beyond the ischial tuberosity on each side. A second is to be carried a little behind the tip of the coccyx in the same direction, and for the same distance. The two transverse cuts are to be connected by carrying the knife along the mid-line, and around the anus. The flaps of the skin thus marked out are to be raised and thrown out- wards from the middle line : in detaching the skin from the margin E EDISSECTION OP THE PERINEUM. 418 of external sphincter muscle.

Pudic ves- sels on the outer wall, of the aims, the superficial sphincter muscles rS'ay be injured with- out care, for they are close to the skin, without the intervention of fat. The dissector should trace the external sphincter to the coccyx, and forwards for a short distance beneath the skin, and define a fleshy slip on each side in front and behind to the subcutaneous fatty layer. The next step is to bring into view the ischio-rectal hollow between the side of the rectum and the tuberosity of the hip-bone. On the left side the fat is to be cleaned out of it without reference to the vessels and nerves, but on the opposite side a special dissec- tion is to be made of them. To take out the fat from the left fossa, begin at the outer margin of the sphincter ani, and proceed forwards and backwards. In front the dissection should not extend farther than the anus, while behind it should lay bare the margin of the gluteus maximus. On the inner side of the hollow the levator ani (sometimes very pale) is to be exposed by the removal of a thin layer of areolar tissue (anal fascia.) On the outer boundary the pudic vessels and the accompanying nerves should be denuded: they lie in a canal formed by fascia, and at some distance from the surface. On the right side it is not necessary to clean the muscular fibres when following the vessels and nerves. If the student begins at the outer border of the sphincter, he will find the inferior haemor- rhoids] vessels and nerve, which he may trace outwards to the pudic trunks; some of the branches, which join the superficial perineal and inferior pudendal nerves, are to be followed forwards. In the posterior angle of the space seek a small offset of the fourth sacral nerve; and external to it, branches of the perforating cutaneous nerve from the sacral plexus, with small vessels, turning round the border of the gluteus. Near the front of the fossa is the superficial perineal artery with a nerve ; and the last, after communicating with the hDemorrhoidal nerve, leaves the fossa. A second perineal nerve, with a deeper position, may be found at the front of the hollow. The ischio-rectal fossa (fig. 132) is the interval between the rectum and the ischial part of the hip-bone. It is a somewhat pyramidal hollow, which is larger behind than before, and dimin- ishes in width as it sinks on the inner side of the hip-bone. Its width is about one inch at the surface; and its depth about two inches at the outer side. It is filled by a soft granular fat. The inner or longest side of the space is very oblique, and is formed by the levator ani muscle (d), together with the coccygeus at the back ; but the outer side is vertical, and is formed by the obturator internus muscle and the fascia covering it. In front it is limited by the triangular ligament (to be afterwards seen); and behind are the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and the largest gluteal muscle. Towards the surface it is covered by the teguments, and is overlaid in part by the gluteus (e) and the sphincter extemus (a). Vessels and nerves in the space.

Internal sphincter a pale hand, is part of (lures of intestine; Insertion of levator ani into coccyx and tendon in front of it; into rectum, and the cent re of the perineum: relations; layer of involuntary muscle surrounds the anus with radiating fibres. Externally it blends with the subdermic tissue outside the internal sphincter ; and internally it enters the anus and ends in the sub- mucous tissue within the sphincter. Action. This muscle draws upwards and inverts the mucous membrane of the lower end of the gut, after it has been protruded and everted in the passage of the fsBces. The external sphincter (sphincter ani externus ; fig. 132, a) is a flat, orbicular muscle, which surrounds the lower end of the rectum. The fibres form ellipses around a central aperture, as in other orbicular muscles. It arises posteriorly by a fibrous band from the back of the coccyx near the tip, and by fleshy fibres mi each side from the subcutaneous fatty layer. Its fibres pass for- wards to the anus, where they separate to encircle that aperture ; and they are inserted in front into the central point of the perineum, and into the superficial fascia by a fleshy slip on each side. The sphincter is close beneath the skin, and conceals partly the levator ani. The outer border projects over the ischio-rectal fossa ; and the inner is contiguous to the internal sphincter. Action. The muscle gathers into a roll the skin around the anus, and occludes the anal aperture. Commonly the fibres are in a state of involuntary slight contraction, but they may be firmly contract ed under the influence of tbe will. The internal sphincter (sphincter ani internus ; fig. 132, c) is situate round the extremity of the intestine, internal to tbe preceding muscle, and its edge will be seen by removing the corrugator and the mucous membrane. The fibres of the muscle are pale, fine in texture, quite separate from the surrounding external sphincter, and encircle the anus in the form of a ring about half an incb in depth. The muscle is a thickened band of the involuntary circular fibres of the large intestme, and is not attached to the bone. Action. This sphincter assists the external in closing the anus ; and its contraction is altogether involuntary. The levator ani (fig. 132, d) can be seen only in part ; ami the external sphincter may be detached from the coccyx, in order that its insertion may be more apparent. The muscle descends from its origin at the inner aspect of the hip-bone, and is inserted along the middle line from the coccyx to the central point of the perineum. The hindmost fibres are attached to the side of the coccyx : and between that bone and the rectum the nmscles of opposite sides are united in a median tendinous line. The middle fibres are blended with the side of the rectum. And the anterior are joined with the opposite muscle, in front of the rectum, in the central point of the perineum. This muscle bounds the ischio-rectal fossa on the inner side, and unites with its fellow to form a fleshy layer (pelvic diaphragm), con- vex downwards, through which the rectum is transmitted. Deeper than the muscle is the recto-vesical fascia. Along the hinder border is placed the coccygeus.PUDIC VESSELS AND NERVE. 421 Action.

Other cutaneous offsets of the nerve run forwards over the fossa, and communicate with one of the superficial perineal nerves, and with the inferior pudendal (of the small sciatic) on the margin of the thigh. The perineal branch is the largest of the three divisions, and runs perineal; forwards in a sheath of the obturator fascia, lying below the pudic vessels. At the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa it divides into cutaneous, muscular, and genital offsets.

Placed midway between the bones, the urethra is supported by the triangular ligament of the perineum, and by its union with the penis. Muscles are collected around the urethra and the crura of the penis : most of these are superficial to, but one is within- the trian- gular ligament. The vessels and nerve lie along the outer side, as in the posterior half, and send inwards offsets. Dissection (fig. 133). To raise the skin from the anterior half of the perineum, a transverse cut is to be made at the back of the scrotum, and is to be continued for a short distance (two inches) on each thigh. A second incision along the middle line will allow the Haps of skin to be reflected outwards. After the removal of the skin, the superficial fascia which covers the front of the perineal space is to be blown up by means of a pipe introduced beneath it posteriorly. Each side is to be inflated to demonstrate a partition along the mid- dle line, and a septum between the perineal space and the thigh, which prevents the air passing to the limb. The student is next to cut through the superficial fascia on the left side from the scrotum to the ischio-rectal fossa; and after reflecting it, and removing loose fatty tissue, its line of attachment to the bone externally, and to the triangular ligament posteriorly, will be brought into view. The septum along the middle line should be also defined. To show more completely the attachment of this layer to the hip- bone between the perineal space and the thigh, it will be necessary to take away from the left limb the fat on the fascia lata, external to the margin of the bone. In the fat of the thigh on the right side the student should seek the inferior pudendal nerve, which pierces the fascia lata one inchSUPERFICIAL FASCIA OF ANTERIOR HALF. 423 in front of the ischial tuberosity, and about the same distance from ^rdvecndal the mar<rin of the bone ; and he should trace its junction in the fat with the inferior hamiorrhoidal nerve.

Air blown beneath the fascia passes forwards to the scrotum ; and this direction is given to it by the deep connections of the membrane with parts around. Should urine be effused beneath the superficial fascia, the fluid will necessarily be directed forwards, like the air, through the scrotum to the penis and the front of the abdomen. Dissection. The superficial vessels and nerves are to be dissected on the right side of the perineum, by cutting through the super- ficial fascia in the same manner as on the left side. The long slender artery then visible is the superficial perineal, which gives a transverse branch near its commencement. Two superficial perineal nerves accompany the artery; and the inferior pudendal nerve is to be traced forwards to the scrotum. Communications are to be sought between these nerves anteriorly, and between one of the perineal and the inferior hamrorrhoidal posteriorly ; and all the nerves are to be followed backwards. Arteries (fig. 133). The superficial and transverse perineal arteries beneath the fascia are branches of the pudic, and are two or three in number. The superficial perineal artery (fig. 133, b), arising at the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa, runs over or under the transverse muscle, and beneath the superficial fascia, to the back of the scrotum, where it ends in flexuous branches. In its course through the perineum the vessel supplies offsets to the muscles beneath ; and in the scrotum it anastomoses with the external pudic branches and supplies of the femoral artery. Sometimes there is a second perineal branch. The transverse artery of the perineum (fig. 133, a) arises from the preceding, and is directed transversely to the middle of the perineal space, where it is distributed to the integuments and the muscles between the urethra and the rectum. It anastomoses with the one of the opposite side. Branches of veins accompany the arteries, and open into the trunk of the pudic vein ; those with the superficial perineal artery are plexiform at the scrotum. Nerves (fig. 133). Three nerves run forwards to the scrotum on each side, viz., the inferior pudendal of the small sciatic, and two superficial perineal branches of the pudic nerve. The superficial perineal nerves, two in number, are named external and internal: both arise in the ischio-rectal fossa from the perineal division of the pudic nerve (p. 421). The external branch (2) is continued forwards, beneath the super- ficial fascia, with the artery of the same name to the back of the scrotum. While in the fossa the nerve gives inwards an offset to the integuments in front of the anus ; and this communicates with the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. Superficial vessels of pudic.

At the scrotum they are distributed by long slender filaments, which reach and penU. ;is far as the under surface of the penis. Other muscular branches of the perineal nerve will be afterwards examined (p. 426). The inferior pudendal nerve (4) is a branch of the small sciatic. Injf^°cJa, It pierces the fascia lata about one inch in front of the ischial Uene tuberosity, and enters beneath the superficial fascia of the perineum, to end in the outer and fore parts of the scrotum. Communica- ends in tions take place between this nerve, the inferior haemorrhoidal, and the outer of the two superficial perineal branches. Dissection, For the display of the muscles, the superficial fascia, Msse^on as well as the vessels and nerves of the left side, must be taken of the away from the anterior half of the perineal space. Afterwards a ^raald thin aponeurotic layer is to be removed from the surface of the muscles. Next to the middle line lies the ejaculator urinae ; along the outer edge of the space is the erector penis ; and behind, passing obliquely between the other two, is the transverse muscle. On the right side the student should seek the branches of the and of their perineal nerve to the muscles. Muscles (fig. 133). Superficial to the triangular ligament, in the Three anterior half of the perineal space, are three muscles, viz., the ™™Ctr?- erector penis, the ejaculator urinae, and the transversus perinei. angular Another muscle of the urethra is contained between the layers of ''Sament- the triangular ligament, and will be subsequently seen.

It is placed about one inch in front of the anus, and in it the muscles acting on the rectum and urethra where are united. Its development varies greatly in different bodies. j^lif0163 The erector penis (ischio-cavernosus ; fig. 133, b) is the most Erector external of the three muscles, and is narrower at each end than in I*1"8: the middle.

The muscle compresses the crus penis against the sub- use. jacent bone, and retards the escape of the blood from the corpus cavemosum by the veins : in that way it will contribute to the erection of the oixran. o The ejaculator urinae (bulbo-cavernosus ; fig. 133, a) lies on Ejaculator the urethra.

The anterior fibres, which are the longest and best marked, are inserted into the penis on its outer aspect, in front of the erector ; and, according to .Kobelt, they send a tendinous expansion over the dorsal vessels of the penis. The intervening fibres turn round the urethra, sur- rounding it for two inches, and join their fellows in a common tendon. The ejaculator muscle covers the bulb and the corpus spongiosum for nearly three inches below and in front of the triangular liga- ment. If the muscle be cut through on the left side, and turned off the urethra, the junction with its fellow above that tube will be apparent. Action. The two halves, acting as one muscle, can diminish the urethra, and eject forcibly its contents. During the flow of fluid in micturition the fibres are relaxed, but they come into use at the end of the process, when the passage has to be cleared. The action is involuntary in the emission of the semen. The transversus perinei (fig. 133, c) is a small thin muscle, which lies across the perinemn opposite the base of the triangular ligament. Arising from the inner side of the ischial tuberosity at the fore part, it is inserted into the central point of the perineum with the muscle of the opposite side, and with the sphincter ani and the ejaculator urinse. Behind this muscle the superficial fascia curves round to join the triangular ligament. Action. From the direction of the fibres the muscle will draw backwards the central point of the perineum, and help to fix it pre- paratory to the contraction of the ejacidator. Sometimes there is a second small fleshy slip in front of the transversalis, which has been named transversalis alter; this throws itself into the ejaculator muscle. The three muscles above described, when separated from each other by the dissection, limit a triangular space, of which the ejacu- lator urinffi forms the inner boundary, the .erector penis the outer side, and the transversus perinei the base. In the area of this interval is the triangular ligament of the urethra, with the super- ficial perineal vessels and nerves. The knife entering the posterior part of this space during the deeper incisions in the lateral operation of lithotomy will divide the transverse muscle and artery, and probably the superficial perineal vessels and nerves. The perineal division op the pudic nerve (p. 421) breaks up in the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa into superficial and deep branches. Its two superficial offsets have been followed to the scrotum (p. 424). The deep branches are museular to the fore pai ls of the external sphincter and levator ani, to the transversus perinei, erector penis, and ejaculator urinse, and the nerve to the bulb, a long slender branch, which pierces the last muscle and, dividing into filaments, enters the hinder portion of the corpus spongiosum. Dissection (fig. 134). For the display of the triangular ligament, the muscles and the crus penis, which are superficial to it, are to be detached on the left side in the following way ;—the ejaculator urinse427 TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. ia to be removed completely from the corpus spongiosum and the surface of the ligament, and the erector muscle from the crus ot the penis Next, the crus penis is to be detached from the bone ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament nor to injure, near the pubic ramus, the terminal branches of the pudic artery and the nerve to the penis. The TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT OF THE URETHRA (deep perineal Tmngularf aponeurosis; fig. 134, c) occupies the anterior part of the sub-u?ethn.: pubic arch, and is about one inch and a half in depth in the middle line. On each side it is fixed to the pubic and ischial rami beneath the attaeh- crus penis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and in the mid- m ' die line is united with the central point of the perineum ; while laterally it is free and sloped towards the bone, so that the ligament is deeper at the sides than in the centre. Superficial to it are the bulb of the corpus spongiosum and the crura of the penis, with the ami muscles of the anterior half of the perineal space ; and the super- relatl0ns i ficial fascia joins it along the hinder border. From its deep surface some fibres of the levator ani arise ; and the thin anal fascia is con- tinued backwards from the ligament over that muscle in the ischio- rectal fossa. * Deep dissection of the perineum (Illustrations of Dissections).

The ligament is composed of two layers of membrane (superior and inferior) which are united along the base. The superior layer is derived from the recto-vesical fascia. The inferior is a separate membrane, formed chiefly of transverse fibres ; but it is so thin as to allow the vessels and the muscular fibres to be seen through it. Perforating the inferior layer of the ligament, about one inch from the symphysis pubis, is the canal of the urethra ; but the margin of the opening giving passage to that tube is blended with the tissue of the corpus spongiosum. Nearer the symphysis, and close to the bone on each side, the terminal part of the pudic artery and the dorsal nerve of the penis (b and 3) perforate the ligament by separate apertures. Between the layers of the ligament are contained the membran- ous part of the urethra, the Fig. 135.* constrictor urethra? muscle, Cowper's glands, the pudic vessels with their branches to the bulb, and the dorsal nerves of the penis. Dissection. The muscle be- tween the layers of the liga- ment will be reached by cutting through with care, on the left side, the superficial stratum near its attachment to the bone, and raising and turning inwards that piece of membrane. By a little cautious dissection, and the removal of some veins, the fleshy fibres of the constrictor urethras will be exposed. The constrictor orethr;E (fig. 134, i; 135, b) extends trans- versely across the subpubic arch, enclosing the membranous part of the urethra in the same way as the sphincter ani externus surrounds the end of the rectum. The muscle is attached by tendinous bundles on each side to the rami of the pubis and ischium, and other fibres spring from the two layers of the triangular ligament. Between these attachments the fleshy fibres are directed transversely and obliquely across the middle line, one set passing in front of, and another behind the urethra, where they are interrupted in some cases by a small median tendon. At the anterior border of the muscle there is a short fibrous band stretching across between the inferior rami of the pubic bones, and bounding with the subpubic ligament at the lower margin of the symphysis an oval opening, through which the dorsal vein of the penis enters * The symphysis pubis seen from above, with part of the urinary bladder and the prostate, and with the tube of the urethra surrounded by the con- strictor muscle (Santorini). a.

This muscle acts as a sphincter in narrowing the ^s°rictor membranous part of the urethra, and ejectiug the contents of the tube. It may also aid in producing erection of the penis by compressing the veins of the corpora cavernosa, which are sur- rounded by its fibres.

Its aperture in the ordinary state does not admit a bristle. The nature of the secretion of the gland is not known. These bodies are sometimes so small as to escape detection, and they vary they appear to decrease in size with advancing age. m slZ6" Dissection. The student may complete the examination of the Dissection perineum by tracing out on the left side the pudic vessels with ^'ens^ their remaining branches, and the dorsal nerve of the penis. From the point of its division beneath the crus into two branches (dorsal of the penis, and cavernous), the artery is to be followed back- wards along the bone: the nerve will be found by the side of, but deeper than the artery.

The artery of the hull) is a branch of considerable size, and arises near the base of the triangular ligament. Passing almost transversely inwards between the fibres of the constrictor muscle, about half an inch from the base of the triangular ligament, the artery reaches the upper surface of the bulb, and enters the spongy structure. Near the urethra it furnishes a small branch to Cowper's- gland. The distance of this branch from the base of the ligament will be influenced by its origin nearer the front or back of the perineal space. If the vessel arises earlier than usual, it may be altogether behind the ligament, and may cross the front of the ischio-rectal fossa, so as to be liable to be cut in the operation of lithotomy. c. The artery of the corpus cavernosum (c) is one of the terminal branches of the pudic. At first this vessel lies between the crus penis and the bone, but it soon enters the crus, and ramifies in the cavernous structure of the penis (p. 577). d. The dorsal artery of the penis (h) is in direction the continua- tion of the pudic ; it runs upwards between the crus and the bone, and reaches the dorsum of the penis by passing through the suspensory ligament. Its distribution with the accompanying nerve is noticed at page 440. Accessory pudic artery. In some cases the pudic artery is not large enough to supply the branches aboAre described to the penis and the urethra. One or more offsets will then be contributed by an accessory vessel, which leaves the pelvis in front by piercing the triangular ligament. The source of this accessory artery is the internal iliac (p. 559). The pudic veins, two in number, have frequent communications together, so as to form a plexus round the artery; they receive similar branches, except that the dorsal vein of the penis does not join them. The dorsal nerve of the penis has been seen in the ischio- rectal fossa (p. 422). In the anterior half of the perineum it takes a similar course to the pudic artery, but at a deeper level and in a distinct sheath, within the triangular ligament, and then pierces the superficial layer of that structure close to the inferior ramus of the pubis, to be continued with the dorsal artery to the penis. Its termination is described at p. 440. The nerve supplies filaments to the constrictor urethra muscle. Parts cut in the lateral operation of lithotomy. This operation for stone in the bladder may be divided into three stages, viz., cutting down to the urethra, opening the canal, and slitting the tube and the neck of the bladder. In the external incision the knife is entered near the middle line of the perineum, one inch in front of the anus, and is drawn backwards on the left side as far as midway between the ischial tuberosity and the anus. The skin and fat, the transverse perineal muscle and artery, the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels and nerve lying across the ischio-rectal fossa,431 PARTS ENDANGERED IN LITHOTOMY. and possibly the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, will be cut in this first stage of the operation. In the subsequent attempt to reach the staff, when the knife is ™^iug introduced into the front of the wound, the hinder part of the triangalar ligament and constrictor urethra, and the fore part of the levator ani will be divided; and when the knife is placed within the groove of the staff, the membranous part of the urethra will be cut, with the muscular fibre about it. Lastly, as the knife as pushed along the staff into the bladder, it andjn run- incises in its progress the membranous portion of the urethra, part staff. of the prostate with large veins around it, and the neck of the bladder. When the last two parts are being cut, the handle of the knife is to be raised, and the blade depressed ; and the incision is to be made downwards and outwards, in the direction of a line from the urethra through the left lateral lobe of the prostate, above the level of the ejaculatory duct. Parts to be avoided. In the first incision in the ischio-rectal fossa, Parts to be the rectum may be cut if the knife is turned inwards across the rectum,are intestine, instead of being kept parallel with it ; and if the gut is not held out of the way with the fore finger of the left hand. The ^'ecls pudic vessels on the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa may be wounded near the anterior part of the hollow, where they approach the margin of the triangular ligament; but, posteriorly, they are securely lodged inside the projection of the ischial tuberosity. While making the deeper incisions to reach the staff, the artery artery of of the bulb lies immediately in front of the knife, and will be ' wounded if the incisions are made too far forwards ; but the vessel must almost necessarily be cut, when it arises farther back than usual, and crosses the front of the ischio-rectal fossa in its course to the bulb of the urethra. In the last stage of the operation the neck of the bladder should gotp-yeslca not be incised to a greater extent than is necessary for the extraction of the stone, lest the recto-vesical fascia separating the perineum from the pelvis should be divided, and the abdominal cavity opened. Too large an incision through the prostate may wound also an and acces- unusual accessory pudic artery on the side of that body. artery.11 ° Directions.

In the middle line there are the aperture of the anus and the cleft of the vulva, which are separated from one another by an interval of about an inch. The anus is situate a little farther back than in the male. The cleft or rima of the vulva is bounded at the sides by the labia majora, two prominent folds, thick and rounded in front, bul becoming thinner as they pass backwards, which correspond to the scrotum of the male. The labia are formed externally by skin, which is provided with scattered hairs, and internally by mucous membrane. They are united in front and behind in the anterior and posterior commissures. "Within the rima, at the fore part, is the clitoris, from which two folds of mucous membrane, the labia minora or mjmplm, extend backwards, one on each side of the aperture of the vagina. At its anterior end each nymph a divides into two smaller folds, the outer of which unites with the one of the opposite side so as to form a kind of hood over the front of the clitoris—the pneputium cUtoridis, while the inner one, much shorter and thinner, is attached to the back of the clitoris in contact with its fellow, the two constituting the framulum cUtoridis. Enclosed by the labia minora, and between the clitoris and the orifice of the vagina, is a median recess about an inch and a half deep, which is called the vestibule. At the hinder part of the vestibule is the orifice of the urethra (meatus urinarius), surrounded bv a slight eminence, about one inch behind the clitoris, and ripar the aperture of the vagina. The orifice of tlie vagina varies much in size; and in the child and virgin it is often partly closed behind by a thin semilunar fold of the mucous membrane—the hymen. After the destruction of the hymen small, irregularly shaped projections, the carwncula myrtiformes, are found in its place. At the back of the rima, within the posterior commissure of the labia, is a narrow transverse fold of the integument called the fourchette or frcenulum pudendi; and to the interval between the framulum and the commissure the name fossa navicidaris is given. Deep boundaries. The deep boundaries of the perineum are alike in both sexes; but in the female the outlet of the pelvis is larger than in the male. Dissection. The steps of the dissection are much the same in both sexes, and the same description will serve, generally, for the male and female perineum. First, the dissection of the ischio-rectal fossa is to be made. Afterwards the muscles, vessels and nerves of the posterior half of the perineal space are to be examined. (See description of the male perineum, pp. 417 to 422). Next the skin is to be taken from the anterior half of the perineal space, as in the male ; and the transverse incision in front, is to be made at the anterior part of the vulva. The attachments of the433 ANTERIOK HALF IN FEMALE. superficial fascia are then to be looked to, and the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be traced beneath it (p. 422). Superficial fascia. The description of this fascia in the male will serve for the like part in the female, with these modifications :—that in the female it is interrupted in the middle bine, and is of less extent, in consequence of the aperture of the vulva ; and that it is continued forwards through the labia majora to the inguinal region. In the labia the superficial fascia contains involuntary muscular fibres, like the dartos tunic of the scrotum, as well as fat. The superficial perineal vessels and nerves, and the inferior pudendal nerve have the same arrangement as in the male (p. 424) ; but they are distributed to the labia instead of to the scrotum. Dissection, The labia and the superficial fascia are to be removed, to follow the sphincter muscle around the opening of the vagina. Two other muscles are exposed at the same Fig. 136.* time, viz., the erector clitoridis lying along the ramus of the ischium, and the trans- versus perinei passing across the perineum to the central point. The sphincter vagina (bulbo - caver- nosas ; fig. 136, a) is an orbicular muscle aroimd the orifice of the vagina, and cor- responds to the ejacu- lator urinse in the male. Posteriorly it is attached to the central point of the perineum, where it blends with the sphincter ani and transversus muscles ; and its fibres are directed forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the body of the clitoris. The muscle covers the bulb of the vestibule and the gland of Bartholin by the side of the entrance to the vagina. Action. Like the other orbicular muscles, the sphincter diminishes that part of the vagina which it encircles ; and it assists in fixing the central point of the perineum. The erector clitoridis (ischio-cavernosus) resembles the erector of the penis in the male, though it is much smaller (p. 425). The transversus perinei is similar to the muscle of the same name in the male. The one description will suffice for the muscle in both sexes (p. 426). Superficial fascia. Dartoid tissue.

To see the triangular ligament of the urethra, the erector and the cms clitoridis are to be detached from the bone on the left side, and the corresponding half of the sphincter vaginae i» to be removed. The triangular ligament transmits the urethra, but is not quite so strongly marked as in the male (p. 427) ; it is interrupted to a large extent in the middle line by the aperture of the vagina. Dissection. By cutting through the superficial layer of the liga- ment in the same way as in the male (p. 428), the deep muscle, with the pudic vessels and their branches, and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, will be arrived at. The transversus perinei profdndus is the representative of the constrictor urethras of the male. It arises on each side from the pubic and ischial rami ; and the fibres are directed inwards to be inserted mainly into the side of the vagina. The hindmost ones join the central point of the perineum ; and anteriorly some are con- tinued across from side to side in front of the urethra. Beneath the last is a circular layer of involuntary fibres, as in the other sex. Glands op Bartholin. At the hinder part of the entrance to the vagina on each side is a yellowish glandular body, which corre- sponds to Cowper's gland in the male. It has the shape and size generally of a small bean, its greatest length, which is directed from before backwards, measuring about half an inch. It lies close to the hinder end of the bulb of the vestibule, and is covered by the fibres of the sphincter vaginae. The duct is directed forwards and downwards for about three-quarters of an inch, to open on the inner aspect of the nympha of the same side, immediately below the hymen or its remains. The description of the pudic artery (p. 429) will serve for both sexes, except that the branch to the bulb is small, and is furnished to the bulb of the vestibule. The terminal branches are the artery of the corpus cavernosum and the dorsal artery of the clitoris, and are also much smaller than the corresponding vessels in the male. The pudic nerve has the same arrangement as in the male. From its perineal division proceed the two superficial nerves, branches to the superficial muscles, and an offset to the bulb. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris is of small size.CHAPTER VIII. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Section I. WALL OF THE ABDOMEN. The dissection is to be carried as far as the end of Section III Directions (p. 493), before the body is turned for the examination of the back, ^section. Position. The body will be sufficiently raised by the blocks Position of beneath the thorax and head for the dissection of the upper limbs tlje body, and neck, but the dissector shoidd see that the chtst is higher than the pelvis. If the abdomen is flaccid, it may be inflated through an aperture in the umbilicus, but if it is firm, proceed with the dissection without blowing it up. Surface-marking. On its anterior aspect the abdomen is pretty Appear- uniformly convex, especially in fat bodies ; but at the side there is jj„"a8c°" *he a slight hollow below the ribs, and a groove marks the position of the abdo- the iliac crest. Along the middle line is a groove over the linea alba, men' which begins above in a depression over the ensiform process {epigastric or infrasternal fossa), and becoming gradually shallower Pit of the below, ends a little beyond the umbilicus. The latter is a round, stomach- . Navel depressed cicatrix, situate nearer to the pubic bones than to the lower end of the body of the sternum, and opposite, as a rule, the disc between the third and fourth lumbar vertebra). On each side of the median groove is the elevation of the rectus muscle, which is intersected in adult well-formed bodies by two or three trans- verse furrows. Over the lower ends of the recti and the adjacent parts of the Eminence of pubic bones the surface is somewhat elevated, owing to a slight Pubes- accumulation of fat; and the name pubes has been given to this part from its thick covering of hair. This projection is especially marked in front of the bones in the female, where it is distinguished as the mons Veneris. Beneath the eminence of the pubes the student Mons will be able to recognize with his finger the symphysis pubis, and Veneris- to trace outwards from it the osseous pubic crest, which leads to the prominent pubic spine. From this to the anterior superior iliac inguinal spine the curved ingtiinal furrow extends, separating the abdomen furrow- from the thigh. If the finger be carried along the furrow it will pouparfs detect the firm band of Poupart's ligament, and sometimes one or ''eameut. two inguinal glands.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 436 Abdominal rings, outer, and inner. liaise the skin from the front.

Immediately above and to the outer side of the pubic spine the opening of the external abdominal ring may be felt; and the promi- nence of the spermatic cord descending through it to the testicle may be detected. The internal abdominal ring is farther to the outer side, though it cannot be recognized on the surface with the finger ; but its position may be ascertained by taking a point mid- way between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and a finger's breadth above Poupart's ligament. Dissection. The requisite incisions for raising the skin from the sides and front of the belly are the following ;—One cut is to extend outwards over the side of the chest from the ensiform process to about midway between the sternum and the spine. A second in- cision is to begin at the symphysis pubis, and to be carried outwards along Poupart's ligament and the iliac crest till it ends opposite the first cut. Lastly, the hinder extremities of the two incisions are to be connected along the side of the chest and belly. The piece of skin thus marked out is to be raised towards the middle line, but is not to be taken away ; and the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be sought in the fat at the side and front of the abdomen. Along the side of the abdomen look for the lateral cutaneous nerves, five or six in number, which issue in a line with the corre- sponding nerves of the thorax. At first they lie beneath the fat, and divide into two : one offset is to be traced forwards, and the other backwards, with small cutaneous arteries. On the iliac crest, near the front, is a large branch from the last dorsal nerve; and usually farther back on the crest, and deeper, is a smaller branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve. Near the middle line the small anterior cutaneous nerves will be recognized with small arteries ; these are uncertain in number and size, and are to be followed outwards in the fat. In the inguinal region the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be dissected on the right side, and the superficial fascia on the left. For this purpose, all the fascia superficial to the vessels is to be removed from the right groin. The vessels which will then appear are the superficial pudic internally, the superficial epigastric in the centre, and an offset of the superficial circumflex iliac artery exter- nally. Some inguinal glands lie along the line of Poupart's liga- ment. Two cutaneous nerves are to be sought :—one, the ilio- inguinal, comes through the external abdominal ring, and descends to the thigh and scrotum ; the other, ilio-hypogastric, appears in the superficial fascia above, and rather outside the abdominal ring. In the examination of the superficial fascia on the left side two strata are to be made out, one over and one beneath the vessels. The layer that is superficial to the vessels is to be reflected by means of a transverse cut directed inwards from the front of the ibac crest, and by a vertical one near the middle line to the pubic bone. The subjacent vessels mark the depth of this layer ; and when these are reached, a triangular flap of the fascia is to be thrown towards the thigh. To define the thinner deep stratum, cut it across in the same manner as the other layer, and detach it carefully with theSUPERFICIAL FASCIA OF GROIN. 437 vessels from the tendon of the external oblique muscle. This stratum, like the preceding, is to be traced around the cord to the scrotum ; and as the student follows it downwards, he will find it connected with Poupart's ligament, and blended with the fascia lata close below that structure. The superficial fascia is a single layer over the greater part of the j?a"P?£ficial abdomen ; but in the groin it is divided into a subcutaneous and a j*Sd°'vided deeper stratum by the vessels and the glands. into two The subcutaneous layer contains the fat, and varies therefore in Iayers- appearance and thickness in different bodies ; for it is sometimes taneous0"" divisible into strata, while at others it is very thin, and somewhat J^yer con- membranous near the thigh. It is continuous with the fatty covering of the thigh and abdomen ; and when traced to the limb, it is separated from Poupart's ligament beneath by the superficial vessels and glands. Internally it is continued to the penis and except in scrotum, where it changes its adipose tissue for involuntary mus- *nd^*^ cular fibre ; and after investing the testicle, it is prolonged to the turn, perineum. The deeper layer (fascia of Scarpa) is thinner and more mem- tWn branous than the other, and is closely united to the tendon of the andmeiu- external oblique by fibrous bands along the linea alba. Like the Dranous: subcutaneous part, this layer is continued upwards on the abdomen, ^cxex* and and inwards to the penis and the scrotum, through which it is pro- disposition ; longed to the perineum, where it has attachments to the subjacent parts, as before specified (p. 423). Towards the limb, it ends aandendson little below Poupart's ligament by joining the fascia lata across the fascia lata, front of the thigh. Urine effused in the perineum from rupture of the uretlira will Attach- be directed through the scrotum and along the spermatic cord to "^necourse* the abdomen (p. 424). From the arrangement of the deeper layer of effused of the fascia across the thigh, it is evident that the fluid cannot pass unne" down the limb, though its progress over the front of the abdomen is uninterrupted. In the female the superficial fascia of the groin is separable into Fascia in two layers, and the disposition of each is nearly the same as in the the female- male ; but the part that is continued to the scrotum in the one sex, enters the labium in the other. In the female the round ligament of the uterus is lost in it. Cutaneous Nerves. The skin of the abdomen is supplied Cutaneous mainly by the lower intercostal nerves : thus, the cutaneous branches nerves along the side of the belly are offsets from five or six of those nerves ; and the cutaneous branches along the front are the termi- are derived nal parts of the same trunks. Two other cutaneous offsets from the g^^0 lumbar plexus, viz., ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal, appear at the ° lower part of the abdomen. The lateral cutaneous nerves of the abdomen emerge be- Lateral tween the digitations of the external oblique muscle, in a line with fut^rcostei°f the same set of nerves on the thorax ; and the lowest are the most whica posterior. As soon as they reach the surface they divide, with the divide int0 exception of the last, into an anterior and a posterior branch :DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 438 posterior The posterior branches are small, and are directed back to the integuments over the latissimus dorsi muscle, tamohs 6 anterior branches are continued forwards nearly to the edge of the rectus muscle, and increasing in size from above down, supply the integuments on the side of the belly : they furnish offsets to the digitations of the external oblique muscle. Last dorsal The lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve is larger than, and does not divide like the others. After piercing the fibres of the external oblique muscle, it is directed over the iliac crest to the .sur- face of the gluteal region (p. 631). Anterior The antertor cutaneods nerves of the abdomen pierce the nerves of* saeath of the rectus : in the integuments they bend outwards to- intercostal, wards the lateral cutaneous nerves.

Vessels with Cutaneous Vessels. Cutaneous vessels run with both sets of nerves on the abdomen ;—with the lateral cutaneous nerves are branches from the intercostal arteries; and with the anterior cutaneous are offsets from the internal mammary and epigastric vessels. In the groin are three small superficial branches of the femoral artery, viz., pudic, epigastric, and circumflex iliac. both lateral The lateral cutaneous arteries have the same distribution as the nerves they accompany. The anterior or chief offsets are directed towards the front of the abdomen, and end about the outer edge of the rectus muscle, and anterior The anterior cutaneous arteries are irregular in number cutaueous. ancl in position, like the nerves. After piercing the sheath of the rectus, they run outwards with the nerves towards the other set of branches. Prom Branches of the femoral artery.

The circumflex iliac branch lies below the level of Poupart's liga- g^unflex ment, and sends only a few onsets upwards to the abdomen. The companion veins to these arteries join the internal saphenous Veins, vein of the thigh. The lymphatic glands of the groin are three or foiu- in num- iuguinai ber, and lie along the line of Poupart's ligament. They are placed glan between the strata of the superficial fascia ; and receive lymphatics from the abdominal wall, from the gluteal region and perineum, from the upper and outer portion of the thigh, and from the super- ficial parts of the genital organs. Their efferent ducts pass down- dnetsenter wards to the saphenous opening in the thigh to enter the abdomen. a Dissection. After the examination of the superficial fascia with its Dissection vessels and nerves, the student may prepare the cutaneous coverings °,f p^nf of the penis and scrotum. The skin should be divided along the testicle, dorsum of the penis, and thrown to each side ; and the skin of the scrotum is to be reflected on the left side by means of a vertical incision. Cutaneous coverings of the penis and scrotum. The penis Tegumen- is attached to the front of the pelvis by a suspensory ligament, and iSgof°poni.s is provided with a tegumentary covering continuous with that of the ^^^J* abdomen, but devoid of fat. Around the end of the penis it forms the loose sheath of the prepuce in the following way :—When the skin has reached the extremity, it is reflected backwards as far as the ba3e of the glans, constituting thus a sheath with two layers—the prepuce ; it is forms afterwards continued over the glans, and joins the mucous mem-I)rei>nce brane of the urethra at the orifice on the surface. At the under part of the glans and behind the aperture of the urethra, the integument forms a small triangular fold, frcenum prceputii. and franuni. Where the skin covers the glans, it is inseparably united with Sebaceous that part, is very thin and sensitive, being provided with papilla?, ° and assumes in some cases the characters of a mucous membrane. Behind the glans are some sebaceous follicles—glandula odoriferas. In the scrotum the two layers of the superficial fascia of the groin Teguments become united in a thin membrane of a reddish colour. The m 3crotum- prolongation around the testicle on one side is separate from that on the other side ; and the two pouches, coming in contact in. the middle line, form the septum scroti. The subcutaneous layer in the scrotum, penis, and front of the Muscular perineum contains involuntary muscular fibres, to which the fa£ja?of corrugation of the skin is owing. This contractile structure is named the dartoid tissue. Dissection. By removing all the fatty tissue from the root of the Dissection penis and the front of the symphysis pubis, the suspensory ligament and m?vc«. will be defined. And the dorsal arteries and nerves, with the dorsal vein of the penis, which will be partly laid bare, are to be followed forwards to the glans.

To define abdominal On the side are three flat muscles, of a triangular form, winch is attached by its apex to the front of the symphysis pubis. Widening below, it is fixed to the upper surface of the body of the penis, and is prolonged for some distance on the organ. Perforating the ligament at its junction with the penis are the dorsal vessels and nerves. Dorsal Vessels and Nerves. The arteries and nerves on the dorsum of the penis are branches of the pudic trunks of both sides (p. 430). The vein accompanying the arteries enters the pelvis below the symphysis pubis. The dorsal arteRy, one on each side, pierces the suspensory ligament, and extends forwards to the glans, where it ends in many branches for that structure : in its course the vessel supplies the integuments and the body of the penis. It may be derived from the accessory pudic (p. 430). The dorsal vein is a single trunk, and commences by numerous branches from the glans penis and the prepuce. It rims backwards, between the two arteries, through the suspensory ligament, and then through a special opening below the subpubic ligament (p. 428), to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The vein receives branches from the erectile structure and the integuments of the penis. Each dorsal nerve takes the same course as the artery, and ends like it in numerous branches to the glans penis. It furnishes twigs to the corpus cavernosivm penis, and other offsets to the integuments of the dorsum, sides, and prepuce of the penis. In the female these vessels and nerves are much smaller than in the male, and occupy the upper surface of the clitoris—the organ that represents the penis. Dissection of the muscles. The surface of the external muscle of the abdominal wall (fig. 137) is now to be freed from fascia on both sides of the body. It is not advisable to begin cleaning this muscle in front, because there it has a thin aponeurosis, which may be taken away too readily with the fat. Beginning the dissection at the posterior part, the student is to carry the knife obliquely upwards and downwards in the direction of the fibres. The thin aponeurosis before referred to is in front of a line extended upwards from the anterior end of the iliac crest ; and as the dissector approaches that spot, he must be careful not to injure the tendon, more particularly above, where it lies on the margin of the ribs, and is very indistinct. On the right side the external abdominal ring (c) maybe defined, to show the spermatic cord passing through it; but on the left side a thin fascia (intercolumnar), which is connected with the margin of that opening, is to be preserved. Lastly, the free border of the external oblique should be made evident between the last rib and the iliac crest. Muscles or the Abdominal Wall. On the side of the abdomen are three large flat muscles, which are named from their position to one another, and from the direction of their fibres. The most superficial muscle is the external oblique ; the underlying one, the internal oblique ; and the deepest, the transversalis.441 EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE. Nearer the middle line are placed other muscles which have a thea^neu- vertical direction. In front lie the rectus and pyramidalis, and ^hen- behind is the quadratus lumborum : these are encased by sheatlis yerticttL derived from the aponeuroses of the lateral muscles. The external OBLIQUE muscle (fig. 137, a) is fleshy on the sine, oblique and aponeurotic on the fore part of the abdomen. It arises by muscle: . tteshv processes from the eight lower ribs, the five highest pieces origin from alternating with similar parts of the serratus magnus, and the lowest three with slips of the latissimus dorsi muscle. From the attachment to the ribs the fibres are directed over the side of the abdomen to end in the following insertion into pelvis and linea alba. Aponeurosis covers front of the belly: maimer :—the lower ones descend Fig. 137. almost vertically to be inserted into the anterior half or more of the iliac crest, at the outer margin ; and the upper and middle fibres are continued forwards obliquely to the tendon or aponeurosis on the front of the belly. The aponeurosis occupies the front of the abdomen, internal to a line drawn from the pro- minence of the ninth rib-cartilage to a point about an inch and a half in front of the anterior supe- rior iliac spine; and it is broader below than above. Along the middle line this expansion ends in the linea alba—the common place of union of the aponeuroses of opposite sides. Above, it is thin, and is continued over the thorax to the pectoralis major muscle. Below, its fibres are stronger and more distinct than above, and are directed obliquely downwards and inwards to the pelvis ;—some of them are fixed to the front of the pubis ; and the rest are collected into a firm band, Popart's ligament (b), between the pubic spine and the iliac crest. Relations. The muscle is subcutaneous. Its posterior border is Relations, imattached between the last rib and the iliac crest, but is overlapped commonly by the edge of the latissimus dorsi, except for a short distance below.

Intercolum- nar fibres : Numerous small apertures in the tendon transmit cutaneous vessels and nerves; and near the pubis is the large opening of the external abdominal ring (c), which gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and to the round ligament in the female. Action. Both muscles taking their iixed point at the pelvis will bend the trunk forwards ; but supposing the Bpine fixed, they will draw down the ribs. If they act from the thorax they will elevate the pelvis. Should one muscle contract it will incline the trunk to the same side, or raise the pelvis, according as the upper or the lower attachment may be moveable ; or if the trunk is prevented from being bent, it will turn the thorax to the opposite side. The external oblique also acts powerfully with the other broad muscles in flattening the wall and diminishing the cavity of the abdomen, and in forcing up the diaphragm during expiration by means of pressure transmitted through the abdominal viscera. Parts of the aponeurosis. Besides the general arrangement of the aponeurosis over the front of the abdomen, the student is to examine more minutely the linea alba in the middle line, the external abdominal ring with the fascia prolonged from its margin, and the thickened border named Poupart's ligament. Linea alba (fig. 141). This white band on the front of the abdomen marks the place of meeting of the aponeuroses of opposite sides. It extends from the ensiform process to the pubic symphysis, and is wider above than below. It is perforated here and there by small apertures, which allow pellets of fat to protrude in some bodies. A little below the centre is the umbilicus, which now projects beyond the surface, though before the skin was removed, a hollow indicated its position. External abdominal ring (fig. 137, c). This opening is situa**mear the pubis, between the diverging fibres of the aponeurosis. It is somewhat triangular in form, with the base at the pubic crest, and the apex directed upwards and outwards. The long measurement of the aperture is about an inch, and the transverse about half an inch. ' Its margins are named pillars, and differ in form and strength. The inner one, thin and straight, is attached below to the front of the symphysis pubis, where it decussates with the corresponding piece of the opposite side. The outer margin is stronger, and is curved, so as to form a kind of groove for the support of the spermatic cord : this margin is continuous with Poupart's ligament, and is attached below to the pubic spine. A thin membrane (inter- columnar fascia), derived from sonic fibres on the surface of the aponeurosis, covers the opening. The ring gives passage in the male to the spermatic cord, and in the female to the round ligament; and in each sex the transmitted part lies on the outer pillar as it passes through, and obtains a covering from the intercolumnar fascia. Through this aperture an inguinal hernia protrudes from the wall of the abdomen. The intercolumnar fibres run transversely on the surface of the443 APONEUROSIS OF EXTERNAL OBLIQUE. aponeurosis, and bind together its parallel fibres, so as to construct a firm membrane. Inferiorly, -where they are strongest, some well- attachment marked bundles are connected with the outer third of Poupart's inferi0lly • ligament, and the anterior end of the iliac crest. At the external abdominal ring the fibres stretch from side to side, and close the npper end of that opening ; and as they are prolonged on the cord they pro- from the margin of the ring, they give rise to a membrane named pXmnar the intcrcolumnar or spermatic fascia. On the left side, where the fascia. fascia is entire, tliis thin covering will be manifest on the surface of the cord, or on the round ligament in the female. Dissection. To see the attachments and connections of Poupart's To see ligament, it will be necessary to reflect, on both sides of the body, ^^^aot the lower part of the aponeurosis towards the thigh, as in fig. 142. ligament,- For this purpose an incision is to be carried inwards, through the aponeurosis, from the front of the iliac crest to a sj>ot about three inches from the linea alba ; and the tendon is to be detached from tinwdown the subjacent parts with the handle of the scalpel. When the P^nai aponeurosis cannot be separated farther from the tendons beneath, oblique, near the linea alba, it is to be cut in the direction of a line descending to the symphysis pubis. After the triangular piece of the aponeurosis has been thrown and show towards the thigh, the spermatic cord is to be dislodged from the {£giJ.1^ular surface of Poupart's ligament, to see the insertion of this band into the pubis, and to lay bare the fibres (triangular fascia) which ascend therefrom to the linea alba. Poupart's ligament (fig. 138, d) is the lower border of the aponeu- Poupart's rosis of the external oblique, which is thickened and folded back- llSament: wards, so as to form a slight groove with the concavity up wards. In the hollow of the ligament the lowest fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and the cremaster take their origin. Externally it appears round and cord-like, and is attached outer and to the anterior superior iliac spine. Internally it widens as it innerattach- approaches the pubis (fig. 137, d), and is inserted into the pubic ments; spine and the pectineal line of the hip-bone for about three-quarters forras of an inch, forming a triangular piece -with its base directed outwards, Gimbernafs which is named GimhernaCs ligament (fig. 140). igamen ; By its lower border Poupart's ligament joins the fascia lata of the its direction, thigh ; and so long as this membrane remains uncut, the band is curved with its convexity downwards, especially when the limb is extended on the trunk. The outer half of the ligament is oblique, an(l parts in and is firmly united with the subjacent iliac fascia : its inner half is 90utact witu placed over the vessels passing from the abdomen to the thigh. Triangular fascia. From the insertion of Gimbernat's ligament Triangular into the pectineal line, some fibres are directed upwards and inwards fascia- to the linea alba, where they blend with the other tendons. As the fibres ascend, they diverge and form a thin sheet, to which the above name has been given. Dissection. The upper part of the external oblique is now to be Dissection taken away, on both sides of the body, to see the parts beneath. It ^*IT may be detached by carrying the scalpel through the dictations on oblique.444 DISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN. Clean the cremaster. Tarts covered by external oblique. Internal oblique muscle : origin from pelvis ; insertion into the ribs and linea alba. Aponeurosis divides to enclose rectus, Fig. 138/ the ribs back to the free border, and then through the insertion into the iliac crest. The muscle is to be thrown forwards as far as practicable, after the nerves crossing the iliac crest are dissected out; but in raising it care must be taken not to detach the rectus muscle from the ribs above, nor to cut through the tendon of the internal oblique at the upper part. By the removal of the fatty tissue the underlying internal oblique muscle, with some nerves issuing through it below, will be prepared. At the lower border of the internal oblique the cremaster muscle on the cord is to be defined (fig. 139): it is about as wide as the little finger, and consists of fleshy loops which descend through the external abdominal ring. Its inner attachment is tendinous, and is easily taken away. Parts covered by the external oblique (fig. 138). Beneath the external muscle are the internal oblique, with the ribs- and the intercostal muscles. At the lower part of the ab- domen the muscle conceals- the spermatic cord, and the branches of the lumbar plexus in the abdominal wall. The INTERNAL OBLIQUE muscle (fig. 138, a) is fleshy at the side and aponeurotic in front, like the preceding ; but its fibres (except the lowest) ascend across those of the external oblique. The muscle arises from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, from the anterior two-thirds of the crest of the ilium, and from the tendon of the transversalis muscle (fascia lumborum; c) in the interval between that bone and the last rib. The fibres diverge on the abdomen to their destination :—The upper ones ascend, and have a fleshy insertion into the cartilages of the last three ribs, where they join the in- ternal intercostal muscles of the lowest two spaces. The remaining fibres pass forwards, with varying degrees of obliquity, to the aponeurosis. The aponeurosis of the muscle extends from the thorax to the pelvis, and is broader above than below. For the most part it is. * A. Internal oblique muscle, b. Latissimus dorsi, cut. c. Part of the hinder tendon of the transversalis muscle. D. Poupart's ligament, e. Ex- ternal, f.

Along the middle line the two layers are united together, as well as with those of the opposite side, in the linea alba. Superiorly it is arranged in the following manner :— attachmen for a short distance before it divides, the aponeurosis is fixed to the ninth costal cartilage ; and the posterior layer continues this attach- ment along the eighth and seventh cartilages to the ensiform process; while the anterior layer is prolonged over the chest, being blended with the aponeurosis of the external oblique. Inferiorly its fibres become more distinct and separate from each other, and K& 139.* are inserted into the front of the pubis, and into the pec- tineal line for half an inch behind the attachment of Gimbernat's ligament. Relations. The internal is covered by the external ob- lique muscle. It is attached on all sides, except between Poupart's ligament and the pubis, where it arches over the cord, and has the cre- master muscle contiguous to it. The parts covered by the internal oblique will be seen when the muscle is reflected. Action. Both muscles will depress the ribs, and will assist in forcing back the viscera of the belly, which have been protruded by the descent of the diaj)hragm. One muscle may incline the body laterally ; and con- tracting with the opposite external oblique (the fibres of the two having the same direction) it will rotate the trunk to the same side. The cremaster muscle (fig. 139, d) is a muscular slip which Cremastcr lies along the lower border of the internal oblique, and is named "mscle: from suspending the testicle. The muscle has attachments, at the inner and outer sides, similar to those of the lowest fibres of the internal oblique. Externally it is fleshy, and arises from Poupart's attach- ligament below, and in part beneath the internal oblique, with which external some of the fibres are connected. Internally it is narrow, and is flesh™ * View of the lower part of the internal oblique, with the cremastcr muscle and the testicle, a. External oblique, reflected, b. Internal oblique, c.

Occasionally the fibres may be behind as well as on the sides and front of the cord. Action. It elevates the testicle towards the abdomen, and in some cases is under the influence of the will; but it may be excited to contract invo- luntarily by cold, fear, &c. Dissection. On the left side of the body the student is not to make any farther dissection of the abdominal Avail; and the layers that have been reflected in the groin should be replaced, until the examination of that region is resumed in connection with hernia. On the right side the dissection is to be carried deeper by the removal of the internal oblique and the cremaster. The last muscle may be reflected from the cord by means of a longitudinal incision. To raise the internal ob- lique, it will be necessary to cut it through firstly near the ribs, secondly along the crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament, and lastly at the hinder part, so as to connect the first two incisions. Its depth will be indicated by a fatty layer between it and the transversalis, and by a branch of artery between the two muscles near the anterior superior iliac spine (fig. 142, b). In raising the muscle towards the edge of the rectus, let the student separate with great care the lower fibres from those of the transver- salis, with which they are often conjoined ; and dissect out, between the two, the intercostal nerves and arteries, and the two branches of the lumbar plexus (ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal) near the * a.

Its sheath : how formed its union with three or more tendinous bands across the rectus will have to be cut through; and near the pubis a small muscle, the pyramidalis, will be exposed. The dissector should leave the nerves entering the outer border of the rectus. On the left side of the body the rectus should not be laid bare below the umbilicus, in order that the special dissection of the parts concerned in inguinal hernia may be made on this side The rectos muscle (tig. 141, a) extends along the front of the abdomen from the pelvis to the chest. It is narrowest below, where it arises from the pelvis Fig. 141.* by two tendinous pro- cesses :—one, the internal and smaller, is attached to the front of the sym- physis pubis in common with that of the opposite side; and the external process springs from the pubic crest. Becoming wider towards the thorax, the rectus is inserted by three large fleshy and tendinous slips into the cartilages of the last tliree true ribs, the outermost slip usually extending to the bone of the fifth rib. Some of the inner fibres are often attached to the ensiform process. The muscle is contained in an aponeurotic sheath, except above and below ; and its fibres are inter- rupted at intervals by ir- regular tendinous lines— the inscriptiones tendim a. Action. It will draw down the thorax and the ribs, or raise the pelvis, according as its fixed point may be above or below. Besides imparting movement to the trunk, it will diminish the cavity of the abdomen, and compress the viscera. Sheath of the rectus (d). This sheath is derived from the splitting of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique at the outer edge of the rectus. One piece passes before, and the other behind the muscle ; and the two unite at the inner border so as to complete the sheath.

The anterior layer of the sheath adheres closely to the tendinous intersections of the muscle. The sheath is deficient behind, both at the upper and lower end f^^^and of the muscle. Above, the muscle rests on the ribs, without the below. intervention of the sheath, which is fixed to the margin of the thorax. Below, at, or somewhat above, a point midway between the umbilicus and pubis, the aponeurosis of the internal oblique ceases to split, and then passes altogether in front of the rectus, with the other aponeuroses. When the rectus is raised, the termination of the hinder layer of the sheath is seen to be marked by a more or less distinct white bine, concave towards the pubis, which is termed the semilunar fold of Douglas: below this the rectus is in contact with the transversalis fascia.

If there is a fourth it will be placed below the umbilicus. These markings seldom extend the whole depth or breadth of the muscular fibres, more particidarly above and below. Linea semilunaris (fig. 141). This line corresponds with the Linea seilli- 11111*11*1 S outer edge of the rectus, and reaches from the cartilage of the ninth is at edge of rib to the pubic spine of the hip-bone : it marks the line of division reotus- of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle. The fyramidalis muscle (fig. 141) is triangular in fonn, and is Pyramidalia placed in front of the lower end of the rectus. It arises by its base rauscle: from the front of the pubis, and is inserted into the Linea alba below attach- the mid-point between the umbilicus and the pelvis. This smallinents' muscle is often absent. Action. The muscle renders tense the linea alba ; and when large use. it may assist slightly the rectus in compressing the viscera. Nerves of the Abdominal Wall (fig. 140). Between the Nerves in internal oblique and transversalis muscles are situate the intercostal abdomen, nerves ; and near the pelvis are two branches of the lumbar plexus, viz., the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves. Some arteries accompany the nerves, but they will lie referred to with the vessels of the abdominal wall (p. 453). The LOWER FIVE INTERCOSTAL NERVES (f f) enter the Wall of Intercostal the abdomen from the intercostal spaces. Placed between the two nerves deepest lateral muscles, the nerves are directed forwards to the edge are between of the rectus, and through this muscle to the surface of the abdomen trawivw- near the middle line (p. 438). About midway between the spine salis; and the linea alba, the nerves furnish cutaneous branches to the side of the abdomen (lateral cutaneous ; p. 437) ; and while between the offsets, abdominal muscles they supply muscular branches, and offsets of com- munication with one another. A greater part of the lower than of the upper nerves is visible, owing to the shortness of the inferior spaces. o o450 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

Trans ver- salis fascia is best marked in the groin ; pierced by internal abdominal Ending of fascia below, Situation of The last dorsal nerve (l) is placed below the twelfth rib, and therefore not in an intercostal space, but it has a similar course and distribution to the foregoing. As it extends forwards to the rectus it communicates sometimes with the ilio-hypogastric nerve. Its lateral cutaneous branch perforates the two oblique muscles (p. 438). The iliohypogastric; nerve (2) perforates the back of the transversalis muscle near the iliac crest, and divides into iliac and hypogastric branches. The iliac branch pierces both oblique muscles close to the crest of the ilium, to reach the gluteal region (p. 632). The hypogastric branch is directed forwards above the hip-bone, giving twigs to the transverse and internal oblique muscles, and communicating with the ilio-inguinal nerve. It perforates the fleshy part of the internal oblique near the front of the iliac crest, and the aponeurosis of the external oblique near the linea alba, finally becoming cutaneous in the hypogastric region (p. 438). The ilio-inguinal nerve perforates the transversalis muscle near the front of the iliac crest. It afterwards pierces the internal oblique, and reaches the surface through the external abdominal ring (p. 438) : it furnishes offsets to the internal oblique, the trans- versalis, and the pyramidalis. Dissection. To see the transversalis fascia on the right side, it will be necessary to raise the lower part of the transversalis muscle by two incisions :—one of these is to be carried through the fibres attached to Poupart's ligament ; the other, across the muscle from the front of the iliac crest to the margin of the rectus. With a little care the muscle may be separated easily from the thin fascia beneath. The transversalis fascia (fig. 142, g) is a thin fibrous layer be- tween the transversalis muscle and the peritoneum. In the inguinal region, where it is unsupported by muscles, the fascia is considerably stronger than elsewhere, and is joined by some tendinous fibres of the transversalis muscle ; but farther from the pelvis it gradually decreases in strength, until at the thorax it becomes very thin. In the part of the fascia now laid bare is the internal abdominal ring, which gives passage to the spermatic cord, or the round liga- ment of the uterus, according to the sex ; it resembles the hole into the finger of a glove in being visible from within, but not externally, owing to the fascia being prolonged from its margin on the cord. On the inner side of the ring the fascia is thinner than on the outer, and is fixed to the body of the pubis, and to the ilio-pectineal line behind the conjoined tendon, with which it is imited. Along the outer half of Poupart's ligament the fascia ends by joining the posterior margin of that band, and it will be afterwards seen to unite with the iliac fascia for the same extent (p. 463) ; but beneath the inner half of the ligament it is continued downwards to the thigh, in front of the blood-vessels, to form the anterior part of the crural sheath around them. Internal abdominal ring (fig. 142). This opening is situate mid-451 SPERMATIC CORD. way between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac j"*™^ spine, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. From its margin ring, a thin tubular prolongation of the fascia (infundibuliform fascia) is continued around the cord as before said. Dissection. The tubular prolongation on the cord may be traced ^section by cutting the transversalis fascia horizontally above the opening of pr0ce.sson the ring, and then longitudinally over the cord. With the handle cord- of the scalpel the thin membrane may be reflected to each side, so as to lay bare the subperitoneal fat. The "subperitoneal fat forms a layer between the transversalis fjjjjtofjj. fascia and the peritoneum. Its thickness varies much in different in groin.' bodies, but is greater at the lower than at the upper part of the abdomen. This structure will be more specially noticed in the ex- amination of the wall of the abdomen from the inside. Dissection. After the subperitoneal fat has been seen, let it be re- Trace re- flected to look for the remains of a piece of peritoneum along the peritoneum, cord, in the form of a fibrous thread. The peritoneum, or the serous sac of the abdominal cavity, projects ^j™^"!]} forwards slightly opposite the internal abdominal ring. Connected is prolonged with it at that spot is a fibrous thread (the remains of a prolongation on the cord : to the testis in the foetus) which extends a variable distance along the front of the cord. It is generally impervious, and can be fol- piece may lowed only a very short way ; but it may sometimes be traced as a yionsf81 fine band to the tunica vaginalis of the testis. In some bodies the process may be partly open, being sacculated or s'accu- at intervals ; or it may form occasionally a single large bag in front ' ' of the cord. Lastly, as a rare state, the tube of peritoneum receiv- or open, ing the testis in the foetus may be unclosed, so that a coil of intestine could descend in it from the abdomen. In the female the foetal tube of peritoneum sometimes remains In female pervious for a short distance in front of the round ligament ; the partly open, unobliterated pouch is named the canal of Nuck. The spermatic cord (fig. 142, f) extends from the internal abdo- Spermatic minal ring to the testis, and consists mainly of the vessels and the efferent duct of the gland, united together by coverings from the structures by or through which they pass. In the wall of the abdomen the cord lies obliquelv, since its is °Mique in . f . .... .. the abdomi- aperture ot entrance amongst, is not opposite its aperture of exit nal wall, from, the muscles; but escaped from the abdomen, it descends almost vertically to its destination.

The round ligament, or the suspensory cord of the uterus, occupies 1he inguinal canal in the female, and ends in the integuments of the groin. Its coverings are similar to those of the spermatic cord, ex- cept that it wants the cremaster. Dissection. The constituents of the cord will he displayed by cutting through longitudinally, and turning aside the different sur- rounding layers, and removing the areolar tissue. The dissector should trace branches of the genito-crural nerve and epigastric artery into the cremasteric covering. Vessels and nerves of the cord. In the cord are collected together the spermatic artery and veins, Avhich convey the blood to and from the testicle, the nerves and lymphatics of the testicle, and the vas deferens or the efferent duct. In the female a branch from, the ovarian artery enters the round ligament. The vas deferens reaches from the testicle to the urethra, and is placed behind the other constituents of the cord ; it will be recog- nised by its resemblance in feel to a piece of whipcord, when it is taken between the finger and the thumb. As it enters the abdomen through the opening in the transversalis fascia (internal ring), it lies on the inner side of the vessels of the testicle ; and as it begins its descent to the pelvis, it winds behind the epigastric artery. Cremasteric artery and nerve. The cremasteric covering of the cord has a separate artery and nerve. The artery is derived from the epi- gastric, and is distribttted to the coverings of the cord. The genital branch of the genito-crural nerve enters the cord hy the internal abdo- minal ring, and ends in the cremaster muscle. Cutaneous vessels and nerves are supplied to the integuments covering the cord from the superficial pudic artery and the ilio- inguinal nerve. Dissection, By cutting through the spermatic cord near the pubis, and raising it towards the internal abdominal ring, a fibrous band below Poupart's ligament, the deep crural arch, will appear : it passes inwards to the pubis, and is to be defined with some care. The remaining vessels of the abdominal wall, viz., the epigastric and circumflex iliac, and the ending of the internal mammary artery, are to be next dissected. The epigastric and mammary arteries will be found on raising the outer edge of the rectus, one above and the other below, ramifying in the muscle. The epigastric, with its earliest branches, may be traced by removing the transversalis fascia from it near Poupart's ligament. The circumflex iliac artery lies behind the outer half of Poupart's ligament, and should be pursued along the iliac crest to its ending. Deep crural arch. Below the level of Poupart's ligament is a thin band of transverse fibres over the femoral vessels, which has re- ceived the name deep crural arch from its position and resemblance to the superficial crural arch (Poupart's ligament). This fasciculus of fibres, beginning about the centre of the ligament, is prolonged453 VESSELS OF ABDOMINAL WALL. inwards to the pubis, where it is widened, and is inserted into the pectineal line at the deep aspect of the conjoined tendon of the broad muscles of the abdomen.* It is closely connected with the front of the crural sheath.

The INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES of the lowest two Spaces issue Intercostal between the corresponding ribs (p. 364), and enter the abdominal!irterios- wall between the transversalis and internal oblique muscles : they extend forwards with the nerves, supplying the contiguous muscles, and forming anastomoses with the internal mammary, epigastric and lumbar arteries. .. , Lumbar arteries. The anterior branches of the lumbar arteries Lumbar supply the muscles in the hinder part of the abdominal wall, and artenes- anastomose with the foregoing arteries above, with the circumflex iliac and iliodumbar arteries below. The highest artery accom- panies the last dorsal nerve below the twelfth rib, and is distributed with the nerve. From the lowest .lumbar artery a branch passes to the integuments with the iliac part of the ilio-hypogastric nerve. Internal mammary artery. The abdominal branch of this internal vessel (superior epigastric artery ; p. 259) enters the wall of the m|m?ary abdomen beneath the cartilage of the seventh rib. Descending in the sheath of the rectus, the vessel soon enters the substance of the muscle, and anastomoses in it with the epigastric artery. Branches are given to the neighbouring muscles and the overlying integu- ment. The epigastric artery (fig. 142, a) arises from the external iliac inferior about a quarter of an inch above Poupart's ligament; it ascends epigastric in the sheath of the rectus, and above the umbilicus divides into arte>'y: branches which enter that muscle, and anastomose with the internal mammary. As the artery courses to the rectus it passes beneath the spermatic relations cord (or round ligament of the uterus), and on the inner side of the abdomen! internal abdominal ring ; and it is directed obliquely inwards across the lower part of the abdomen, so as to form the outer boundary of a triangular space along the edge of the rectus. It lies at first beneath the transversalis fascia ; but it soon perforates that mem- brane, and enters the sheath of the rectus over the semilunar border at the posterior aspect. The branches of the artery are numerous, but inconsiderable in Branches: size :— a.

Near the front of the iliac crest a branch (fig. 142, b) ascends between the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, supplying them, and anastomosing with the epigastric and lumbar arteries.

A protrusion of intestine or other organ Situation of through the lower portion of the abdominal wall near Poupart's hernia.*1 ligament (answering to the inguinal region) is named an inguinal hernia. The escape of the intestine in this region is favoured by Predis- the deficiencies in the muscular strata, by the passage of the sper- Jlaturally. matic cord through the abdominal parietes, and by the existence of fossae on the inner surface of the wall. The gut in leaving the abdomen either passes tlirougb the internal Course it abdominal ring with the cord, or is projected through the part of '"llows- the abdominal wall between the epigastric artery and the edge of the rectus muscle. These two kinds of hernia are distinguished by Two kinds: the names external and internal, from their position to the epigastric artery; or they are called oblique and direct, from the direction external or they take through the abdominal wall. Thus, the hernia protruding obll(iue; through the internal abdominal ring with the cord is called external from being outside the artery, and oblique from its slanting course ; while the hernia between the edge of the rectus and the epigastric artery is named internal from being inside the artery, and direct direct.31 °r from its straight course. External or Oblique Inguinal Hernia leaves the cavity of External the abdomen with the spermatic cord, and traversing the inguinal '" oblique- canal, makes its exit from that passage by the external abdominal ring. Anatomy of external hernia. To understand the anatomy of Anatomy this form of hernia, it will be necessary to study the passage which concerned, it occupies in its course through the abdominal wall (inguinal canal), the apertures by which it enters and leaves the wall (abdominal rings), and the coverings it receives in its progress. The inguinal canal (fig. 142) is the interval between the flat inguinal muscles of the abdominal wall, which contains the spermatic cord cansl: in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. It extends from the internal to the external abdominal ring, and extent, measures about one inch and a half in length. From its beginning length and at the internal ring, it is directed obliquely downwards and inwards, direction;DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. being placed above, and nearly parallel to, the inner half of Pou- part's ligament. boundaries Towards the surface of the body the canal is bounded by the integuments and the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle (a) for its whole extent, and by the internal oblique (n) hi addition for and behind; the outer third. Towards the cavity of the abdomen its wall is similarly formed by the peritoneum, subperitoneal tissue and trans- versalis fascia (g) throughout its whole length, and by the Fig. 142.* conjoined tendon (h) of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles in its inner two-thirds, floor, Along the lower part, or the floor, the canal is limited by the meeting of the transversalis fascia with Poupart's ligament, and by the fibres of the ligament inserted into the pectineal line (Gim- androof. bernat's ligament) ; while along the upper part its extent is determined only by the apposition of the muscles, and by the arched borders of the internal oblique and transversalis.

"The internal abdominal ring (fig. 142) is an aperture in the ^J*™?^ transversalis fascia, which is situate midway between the symphysis . pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and haK an inch above situation, Poupart's ligament. It is oval in form ; and its longest diameter, form and wliicli is directed vertically, measures about half an inch : the fascia marsm '• at its outer and lower parts is stronger than at the opposite sides. Arching above and on the inner side of the aperture is the lower relations; border of the transversabis muscle (d), which is fleshy in the outer but tendinous in the inner half. Below it is Poupart's ligament, which separates the aperture from the external iliac artery. On the inner side lie the epigastric vessels (a). This opening in the transversalis fascia is the inlet to the inguinal parts trans- canal, and through it the cord, or the round ligament, passes into m^rh it the wall of the abdomen. An external hernia enters the canal at the same spot. All the protruding parts receive as a covering the prolongation (infundibuliform fascia) from the margin of the opening. The external abdominal ring (fig. 137, c) is the outlet of the in- External guinal canal, and through it the spermatic cord reaches the surface j^'J,0.1111"'11 of the body. This aperture is placed in the aponeurosis of the situation, external oblique mascle, near the crest of the pubis ; and from the margin a prolongation (spermatic fascia) is sent on the parts passing through it (p. 443). Course and coverings of an external hernia. A piece of intestine The intes- leaving the abdomen with the cord, and passing through the inguinal jng {he canal to the surface of the body, will obtain a covering from every £££ cordf stratum of the wall of the abdomen in the groin, except from the ' transversalis muscle. It receives its investments in this order :—As the intestine is has cover- thrust forwards, it carries before it first the peritoneum and the pne^toneSm subperitoneal fat, and enters the tube of the infundibuliform fascia and fat, (f) around the cord. Still increasing in size, it is forced downwards fe^6™*1*8 to the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, where it will have the cremasteric fascia (c) applied to it. The intestine is next cremaster, directed along the front of the cord to the external abdominal ring, spermatic and in passing through that opening receives the investment of the fas''ia> . . . . -l . „ . ° superficial mtercolumnar or spermatic fascia. Lastly, as the hernia descends fascia and towards the scrotum, it has the additional coverings of the super-skin 5 facial fascia and the skin. In a hernia which has passed the external abdominal ring, the seven in coverings from without inwards are therefore the following :—the number: skin and superficial fascia, the spermatic and cremasteric fascia?, the infundibuliform fascia, the subperitoneal tissue, and the peri- toneum or hernial sac. Two of the coverings, viz., the peritoneal how pro- and subperitoneal, originate as the gut protrudes ; but the rest are duced- ready formed round the cord, and the intestine slips inside them. The different layers become much thickened in a hernia that has existed for some time.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 458 How to dis- tinguish it. The taxis. Stricture: where situate; two kinds. To set free external, and internal stricture. Two varieties. Congenital hernia: how con- stituted ; coverings and course ; diagnosis; stricture. Infantile hernia: how con- stituted ; Diagnosis. If the hernia is small, and is confined to the wall of the belly, it gives rise to an elongated swelling along the inguinal canal. If it has proceeded farther, and entered the scrotum, it forms a flask-shaped tumour with the large end below, and the narrow neck occupying the inguinal passage. While efforts are being made to put back a piece of protruded intestine during life, the direction of the canal, and the situation of the internal abdominal ring, should be borne in mind. Seat of stricture. The protruded intestine may be constricted at the internal abdominal ring, in the inguinal canal by the fleshy internal oblique muscle, or at the external abdominal ring. The stricture is placed usually at the internal abdominal ring, and may be produced either by a constricting fibrous band outside the narrowed neck of the tumour, or by a thickening and contraction of the peritoneum itself at the inner surface of the neck. Division of stricture. To set free the intestine, an incision is made down to the internal abdominal ring ; and, all fibrous bands outside the peritoneum being divided, the intestine is to be returned if possible into the abdomen by gentle pressure. Supposing the intestine cannot be replaced in the abdomen after the previous steps have been taken, the surgeon proceeds to lay open the peritoneum, and to divide the internal stricture, from within out, on a director placed beneath it. With the view of avoiding the surrounding vessels, the cut is directed upwards on the front and mid-part of the hernia. Varieties of external hernia. There are two varieties (congenital and infantile) of oblique inguinal hernia, which are distinguished by the condition of the peritoneal covering. Congenital hernia. This kind is found for the most part in the infant and the child, though it may occur in the adult male. In it the tube of peritoneum (processus vaginalis), which receives the testicle in the foetus, remaining unclosed, the intestine descends into a sac already formed for its reception. As it follows the course of the inguinal canal, it will possess the coverings before enumerated for the external hernia ; and it passes at the first to the bottom of the scrotum, instead of being arrested at the top of the testis. With care it may be distinguished, while it is of moderate size, by its position in front of the testicle. For the seat, cause, and division of the stricture, refer to what is before stated for external hernia. Infantile or encysted hernia is much rarer than congenital, and cannot be distinguished from the common external hernia during life. It was first recognised in the young child, and received its name of infantile from that circumstance ; but it may be met with at any period of life. This form of hernia occurs when the foetal processus vaginalis of the peritoneum is closed only in the neighbourhood of the internal abdominal ring, instead of being obliterated from that point down to the testicle, so that a large serous sac will be situate in front ofINTERNAL OR DIRECT HERNIA. 459 the spermatic cord, and may occupy the inguinal canal. With this state of the peritoneum, should an external hernia with its cover- ings descend along the cord in the usual way, it will pass behind the unobliterated sac, like a viscus in a serous membrane. In this way there will be two sacs : an anterior (the tunica vaginalis) con- taining serum, and a posterior enclosing the intestine. An Infantile hernia is first recognised during an operation by j^*™^ the knife opening the tunica vaginalis. The operator then proceeds to lay bare the neck of the hinder or hernial sac, and to treat the stricture of it as before described (p. 458). Internal or Direct Inguinal Hernia escapes on the inner side of the epigastric artery, and has a straight course through the ab- dominal parietes. Its situation and coverings, and the seat of stricture, will be understood after the examination of the part of the abdominal wall through which it passes. Anatomy of internal hernia. In the abdominal wall near the ^"j}^, . pubis is a triangular space to which the name of Hesselbach's triangle boundaries; has been given. This is bounded by the epigastric artery on one side, the outer edge of the rectus muscle on the other, and the inner part of Poupart's ligament below ; it measures about two inches from size; above down, and one inch and a half across at the base. The constituents of the abdominal wall in this area are—the in- constituents of wall; teguments, the muscular strata, and the layers lining the interior of the abdomen, viz., transversalis fascia, subperitoneal tissue, and peritoneum. The muscles have the following arrangement:—The aponeurosis of the external oblique is pierced by the external and disposi- abdominal ring, towards the lower and inner angle of the space. ,Uu"p°es The internal oblique and transversalis, which come next, are united together in the conjoined tendon ; and as this descends to its inser- tion into the pectineal line, it covers the inner two-thirds (about an inch) of the space ; and leaves uncovered about half an inch between its outer edge and the epigastric vessels, where the transversalis fascia appears. Any intestine protruding in this spot must make a new path for Hernia in itself, and elongate the different structures, since there is not any two kinds.°f passage by which it can descend, like an external hernia. Farther, the coverings of the hernia, and its extent and direction in the abdominal wall, must vary according as the gut projects through the portion of the space covered by the conjoined tendon, or through the part external to that tendon. Course and coverings of the hernia. The commoner kind of in- Coverings ternal hernia (inferior) passes through the part of the triangular common0"5 space which is covered by the conjoined tendon. kind arc The intestine in protruding carries before it the peritoneum, the peritoneum subperitoneal fatty membrane, and the transversalis fascia ; next it ""i^siue elongates the conjoined tendon, or as in a sudden rupture, separates transversalis the fibres, and escapes between them. Then the intestine advances ^oh^u into the lower part of the inguinal canal, opposite the external tendon, abdominal ring, and passes through that opening on the inner side spermatic of the cord, receiving at the same time the covering of the spermatic suR°eajlci tDISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN. 460 fascia, and skin.

Rarer kind of internal hernia is oblique in direction with the cord. Coverings are same as in external hernia. Diagnosis not possible in life. fascia. Lastly it is invested by the superficial fascia and the skin. In number the coverings of an internal hernia are the same as those of an external; and in kind the only differences are that the covering of transversalis fascia is not furnished by the infundibuli- form process, and the conjoined tendon is substituted for the cremas- teric fascia. The position of the openings in the abdominal wall, and the1 straightness of its course, should be kept in mind during attempts to reduce this kind of hernia. Diagnosis. This rupture will be distinguished from external hernia by its straight course through tbe abdominal wall, and by the neck being placed close to the pubis. When an inguinal hernia has attained a large size, it is impossible to tell by an external examination whether it began originally in the triangular space, or at the internal abdominal ring ; for as an ex- ternal hernia increases, its weight drags inwards the internal ring into a line with the external, and in this way the swelling accpiires the appearance of a direct rupture. Seat of stricture. The stricture in this form of hernia occurs most frequently outside the neck of the tumour, at the opening that has been formed in the conjoined tendon, though it may be inside from thickening of the peritoneum ; and it may occasionally be found at the external abdominal ring. Division of the stricture. The neck of the tumour is to be laid bare, and all fibrous bands around it are to be divided without in- jury to the peritoneum; but if, after this has been done, the intes- tine cannot be put back into the abdomen, tbe sac is to be opened, and the internal constricting band is to be divided directly upwards on a director. In dividing the stricture on a large rupture appearing to be direct, the cut should be made directly upwards in the middle of the front of the tumour, so as to avoid the epigastric vessels, tbe position of which cannot be ascertained. Variety of interned hernia. Another kind of internal kernia(superior) occurs through that part of the area of the triangular space which is external to the conjoined tendon. The intestine protrudes through the wall of the abdomen close to the epigastric artery, and descends along nearly the whole of the inguinal canal to reach the external abdominal ring ; so that the term " direct" woidd not apply strictly to this form of internal hernia. Coverings. As the gut traverses nearly the whole of the inguinal canal, it has the same coverings as an external hernia, viz., the skin and the superficial fascia, the spermatic and cremasteric fascia}, the transversalis fascia (but not the infundibuliform fascia), and the subperitoneal fat with the peritoneum. Diagnosis. This form of internal hernia would be considered external during life from its course and its form ; and yet it must be remembered that the epigastric vessels are placed on the outer part of its neck, while in the hernia which it simulates they lie on461 UMBILICAL HERNIA. the inner side. Its nature can be ascertained with certainty only after death. Seat of stricture. The constriction of the intestine will take place f^mf u™tf from similar causes, and at the same spots as in the external as external, hernia. Division of the stricture. From an inability to decide always in Division of the living body whether a small hernia is internal or external, the rule observed in dividing the stricture of the neck of the sac is, to cut down upon the mid-part of the tumour ; and if it is necessary to open the peritoneum, to cut directly upwards, as in the other kinds of inguinal hernia. Umbilical Herxia, or exomphalos, is a protrusion of the intestine Umbilical through or bv the side of the umbilicus. It is verv variable in o »* course * size, and its course is straight through the abdominal wall. Coverings. The coverings of the intestine are—the skin and super- coverings ficial fascia, a prolongation from the tendinous margin of the aperture in the linea alba, together with coverings of the transversal is fascia, the subperitoneal fat, and the peritoneum. Over the end of the i,ecome tumour the superficial fascia blends with the other contiguous struc- united over , ., P , t the tumour, tures, and its iat disappears. If the hernia is suddenly produced, it may want the investment changes in ; otherwise derived from the edge of the umbilicus. Seat of stricture. The stricture on the intestine is generally at the stricture, margin of the tendinous opening in the abdominal wall; and it may fonad. be either outside, or in the neck of the sac, as in the other kinds of hernia. It should be remembered that the narrowed neck is at the upjier end and not in the centre of the swelling. Division of the stricture. The constriction may be removed by cutting externally the parts around the neck. Or if the sac is to be opened, the knife may be carried upwards in cutting the stricture; but there is not any vessel liable to injury in the operation. Other Forms of Herxia. At each of the other apertures in the other parietes of the abdomen, a piece of intestine may be protruded, so ^m'" are as to form a hernia. For instance there may be femoral hernia below feInorai Poupart's ligament, with the femoral vessels ; obturator hernia obturator, through the thyroid foramen, with the artery of the same name ; ischiatic.' and ischiatic hernia through the ischiatic notch. The femoral hernia, as the most important, will be noticed pre- sently ; but the student may refer to some special treatise for information respecting the other abdominal hernise. Dissection. The abdomen is now to be opened to see the cords and Dissection depressions on the posterior surface of the wall. A transverse cut abdomen, may be made through the umbilicus across the front of the abdo- men ; and on holding up the lower half of the wall, three prominent fibrous cords, the urachus and the obliterated hypogastric arteries, will be seen ascending to the umbilicus from the pelvis. Cords of the abdominal wall. In the middle line is the urachus, One median which reaches from the summit of the bladder to the umbilicus ; on rord each side is the obliterated hypogastric artery, extending fr om the onc on eac'1 side of the pelvis to the umbilicus ; and a little external to the last, S'de'DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 462 and an near Poupart's ligament, is a less marked prominence of the perito- neum caused by the epigastric artery.

With this disposition of the cords, three hollows (inguinal fST1 fas®) are seen near Poupart's ligament, one internal to the obliterated hypogastric artery, another outside the epigastric artery, and the external, third between the two prominences. The external fossa corresponds by its lower and inner part to the internal abdominal ring, opposite which there is often a slight depression of the peritoneum, and is the place where an external inguinal hernia begins to protrude. internal, The internal fossa is between the obliterated hypogastric artery and the urachus ; its outer part is opposite the external abdominal ringr and is the seat of the commoner (inferior) variety of internal hernia. and middle. The middle fossa is the smallest, and is placed behind the inguinal canal; in it the superior variety of internal hernia leaves the abdo- minal cavity. In some bodies the obliterated hypogastric artery is close to, or behind, the epigastric artery ; and in that case the middle fossa will be wanting. Situation of Femoral Hernia. In this hernia the intestine leaves the abdomen hernia!1 below Poupart's ligament, and descends in the membranous sheath around the femoral vessels. Only so much of the structures will be described here as can be now seen ; the rest are noticed fully in the dissection of the thigh (p. 606). Dissection Dissection. The dissection for femoral hernia is to be made on the concerned13 left side of the body. Divide wall, The lower portion of the abdominal wall is to be divided from the umbilicus to the pubis, the cut being made on the left side of the urachus, and care being taken not to injure the bladder, which may project above the pubic bones. The peritoneum is to be de- detach tached from the inner surface of the flap, and from the iliac fossa, peritoneum . . . 1' and fat e laver °* subperitoneal fatty tissue is to be separated m the same way, and in doing this the spermatic vessels and vas deferens will come into view as they meet at the internal abdominal ring to form and clean the spermatic cord. Beneath these the external iliac vessels are to- iliac vessels. ^e cieane(i^ some lymphatic glands lying along them, and the genito-crural nerve on the artery. (In the female the round liga- ment of the uterus is seen entering the internal abdominal ring round the epigastric artery ; and the ovarian vessels cross the external iliac trunks higher up.) Any loose tissue remaining is to be taken away to show the beginning of the crural sheath around the femoral vessels, and the interval (crural ring) on their inner side (fig. 143). Afterwards the transversalis and iliac fascia; are to be traced t» Poupart's ligament, to see the part that each takes in the formation of the crural sheath. Anatomy Anatomy op femoral hernia. The membranes concerned in st. m-iures. femoral hernia are the peritoneum, the subperitoneal fatty layer, the transversalis and iliac fasciae lining the interior of the abdominal cavity, with the sheath on the femoral vessels to which they give origin at Poupart's ligament.463 FEMORAL HERNIA. The peritoneum lines the inner surface of the abdominal wall, Peritoneal whence it is prolonged without interruption into the iliac fossa and layer' the pelvis ; and its thinness and weakness are apparent now it is detached. The subperitoneal fat extends as a continuous layer beneath the K>??£t peritoneum, but is thickest and most fibrous at the lower part of the abdomen, where the iliac vessels pass under Poupart's ligament. At that spot it extends over the upper opening of the membranous sheath around the vessels, and covers the space of the crural ring internal to the vein. The part of this layer which stretches over the crural ring is forms sep- named the septum crurale (Cloquet) ; and a lymphatic gland is tum crurale- generally attached to its under surface. The transversalis fascia has been before noticed (p. 450). At Transver- Poupart's ligament it joins the iliac fascia outside the situation ofsalis fascia- the external iliac artery ; but internal to that spot it is continued downwards to the thigh in front of the femoral vessels, and forms the anterior part of the crural sheath. The iliac fascia covers the ilio-psoas muscle, and lies beneath the iliac fascia, iliac vessels. At Poupart's ligament it joins the trans- Fig. 143.* versalis fascia external to the iliac vessels ; but be- hind the vessels it is pro- longed into the posterior part of the crural sheath. The crural sheath is a loose membranous tube, which encloses the femoral vessels as they enter the thigh, and is obtained from the fascia? lining the ab- domen. Its anterior half is continuous with the transversalis fascia, and its posterior is derived from the iliac fascia and the pubic fascia of the thigh. The sheath is not entirely filled by the vessels, for a space (crural canal) exists on the inner side of the vein, through wliich the intestine descends in femoral hernia. The aperture leading into the crural canal is called the crural ring. The crural ring (fig. 143, d) is referred to also in the dissection Crural ring: of the thigh, but its boundaries are better seen in the abdomen. It is an interval at the base of the sheath, to the inner side of the femoral vein, which is about half an inch wide, and is filled by a View of the parts concerned in femoral hernia. (R. Quain.)

Bounding it internally are Giinbernat's liga- ment (e) and the conjoined tendon ; and limiting it externally is the femoral vein (5). In front is Poupart's ligament, with the deep crural arch; and behind is the pubis, covered by the pectineufl muscle and the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Crossing the front of the space, but at some little distance from it, is the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The open- ing is larger in the female than in the male. Two of the boundaries, anterior and inner, are firm and sharp- edged, though their condition varies with the position of the limb ; for if the thigh is raised and approximated to its fellow, those bounding parts will be relaxed. Position of vessels around the ring (fig. 143). On the outer side is the femoral Arein (b) ; and above this are the epigastric vessels (c). In front is a small branch (pubic) from the epigastric artery to the back of the pubis ; and the vessels of the spermatic cord may be said to be placed along the anterior aspect of the ring. But in some bodies the obturator artery takes origin from the epigastric, and lies along the ring as it passes to the pelvis. It may have two positions with respect to the crural ring :—either it is placed close to the iljac vein, so as to leave the inner side of that space free from vessels ; or it arches over the aperture, descending on the imier side at the base of Giinbernat's ligament; in this last condition the ring will be encircled by vessels except beliind.

The intestine leaves the abdomen by the opening of the crural ring ; and it descends internal to the vein in the crural sheath, as Jar as the saphenous opening in the thigh, where it projects to the surface. Coverings. In its progress the intestine will push before it the peritoneum and subperitoneal fat (septum crurale) ; and it will displace, or cause to be absorbed, the gland which fills the crural ring. Having reached the level of the saphenous opening, the intestine carries before it the inner side of the crural sheath, and a layer called the cribriform fascia ; and, lastly, it is invested by the superficial fascia and skin of the thigh. The dissection of the thigh may be referred to for fuller details (pp. 606 to 610). Seat of stricture. The stricture of a femoral hernia is placed opposite the base of Giinbernat's ligament, or lower down at the margin of the saphenous opening in the thigh. And the constric- tion may be caused either by a fibrous band outside the upper narrow end of the tumour, or by the thickening of the peritoneum inside the neck, as in inguinal hernia. Division of the stricture. To free the intestine from the constrict- ing fibrous band arching fiver it, an incision is to be made down to the neck of the sac at the inner and upper part. And to relieve the deep stricture within the neck of the sac, the peritoneal bag is to be opened and a director introduced, and the knife is to be carried horizontally inwards, or upwards and inwards, through the thickened sac and a few fibres of the edge of Giinber- nat's ligament.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 465 Danger to vessels.

As this condition of the vessel cannot be recognised beforehand, the surgeon will best avoid the danger of wounding the artery by a cautious and sparing use of the knife. Section III. CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. The abdominal cavity is the space included between the spinal Definition, column behind, and the muscles stretching from the thorax to the pelvis in front. It is lined by a serous membrane (peritoneum), an(j con_ and* contains the digestive, urinary, and generative organs, with tents, vessels and nerves. Dissection.

The resulting flaps may be thrown to the sides. Size and form. This cavity is the largest in the body.

Boundaries. Above it is limited by the diaphragm ; below by the Boundaries recto-vesical fascia and the levatores ani muscles, and by the other jjjjj,™and structures closing the outlet of the pelvis: both these boundaries are concave towards the cavity, and are in part fleshy, so that the space will be diminished by their contraction and flattening.

Lower down, and more to the left, a piece of the stomach is visible ; but this viscus lies mostly beneath the ribs and the liver. Descending from the stomach is a loose fold of peritoneum (the large omentum), which reaches to the pelvis, and conceals the small intestine : in some bodies the omentum is raised into the left hypochondriac region, and leaves the intestine uncovered. The caecum (cm) is usually to be seen in the right iliac region ; and sometimes a part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon comes to the surface in the corresponding situa- tion on the left side. Close above the pubic symphysis is the apex of the bladder (bl), with the urachus (ur) continued upwards from it; and if the organ is distended, a larger part of it is exposed. General -phe alimentary tube presents differences in form, and is divided division of ^ 1RELATIONS OF STOMACH. 467 into stomach, small intestine, and large intestine ; and the two last are farther subdivided as will afterwards appear. The several of viscera have the following general position :—The small intestine several is much coiled, and occupies the greater part of the cavity ; while parts; the great intestine arches round it. Both are held in position by portions of the serous lining. Above the arch of the great intestine arc situate the stomach, the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas ; and of and below it is the convoluted small gut. Behind the intestine, kidney- on each side, is the kidney with its excretory tube. Before the natural position of the viscera is disturbed, their Rfe^tion3 situation in the different regions of the abdomen, and their relations to be seen, to surrounding parte should be examined. RELATIONS OF THE VISCERA. The stomach (fig. 144) intervenes between the gullet and the Position small intestine, and is partly retained in position by folds of the u|e,atlons serous membrane. It is somewhat pyriform in shape, with the stomach, larger end on the left side ; and it is placed in the left hypo- chondriac and the epigastric regions. At its large end the stomach is joined by the oesophagus, which Cardia and fixes it to the diaphragm. The opening of the oesophagus into the stomach is named the cardia, and lies behind the seventh costal cartilage of the left side about an inch from its junction with the .sternum, being on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra. To the left of the cardia, the fundus of the stomach bulges upwards in the fundus; left vault of the diaphragm. The concave border of the stomach to the right of the oesophagus is the small curvature, and is attached to small the liver by a fold of peritoneum—the small omentum. curvature; The right extremity leads into the small intestine (duodenum) pyloric end; by the pyloric orifice, the situation of which is indicated externally by a slight constriction of the tube, and a thickened band in the wall that may be felt with the finger. The pyloric end of the stomach is placed beneath the liver, and about two inches below the xiphi-sternal articulation, at the level usually of the disc between the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebra?. The anterior surface of the stomach is in contact above and to anterior the right with the liver, on the left with the diaphragm, and between these with the abdominal wall. The posterior surface lies and pos- pver the spleen, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum S!ces; (gastro-splenic omentum), the left kidney and suprarenal capsule, the pancreas, and the transverse meso-colon. The convex border or great curvature is directed to the left and great curvn- downwards, and has the great omentum attached to it; along it lies fSedparT* the transverse colon. This is the most moveable part of the organ. The form and position of the stomach vary with its degree of changes in distension. When the organ is empty, it is flattened from before ^jon'1. backwards, and drawn up towards the left hypochondriac region, the empty" ' pyloric end reaching very little to the right of the middle line.

The small intestine reaches from the stomach to the right iliac Small region, where it ends in the large intestine. It is arbitrarily j,° ^ antl divided into three parts,—duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. divisions. The duodenum, comprises the first nine or ten inches (twelve Duodenum lingers' breadths) of the small intestine. By raising the liver it beginning, may be traced from the pyloric end of the stomach, at first back- wards, and then downwards, until it disappears beneath the trans- verse colon. If the great omentum, with the attached transverse colon, be turned up over the margin of the thorax, and the mass of and ending small intestine be drawn to the right, the end of the duodenum will be seen on the left of the spine. It here ascends for a short dis- tance, and at the level of the second lumbar vertebra passes into the jejunum, forming a sharp bend forwards and downwards, which is named the duodeno-jejunal flexure. The relations of the duodenum to be fully cannot, however, be satisfactorily seen at present, and they will be seenlater- examined at a later stage (p. 485). The jejunum and ileum include the remainder of the small intes- Jejunum tine, two-fifths belonging to the jejunum and three-fifths to the ileum, and ile"'" : but there is no natural division between them. This part of the situation; intestinal tube forms many convolutions in the umbilical, hypo- gastric, lumbar, and iliac regions of the abdomen ; and it descends commonly, but more extensively in the female, into the cavity of the pelvis. In front of the convolutions is the great omentum ; and relations; behind, they are fixed to the spine by a large fold of peritoneum named the mesentery, which contains the vessels and nerves. The end of termination of the ileum ascends slightly from the pelvis to the ileum- right iliac fossa, crossing the external iliac vessels and the psoas muscle, to open into the large intestine at a spot a little to the outer side of the sacro-iliac articulation. The large intestine or colon is more fixed than the jejunum Large and ileum, from which it is to be distinguished by its sacculated j^f^f: appearance, and by its being furnished with small processes of peri- anguished; toneum containing fat—the appendices ejnploicm. It begins in the course right iliac region in a rounded part or head (csecum), and ascends to the liver through the right iliac and lumbar regions. Then crossing the abdomen below the stomach, it reaches the left hypochondriac region ; and it lies in this transverse part of its course between the epigastric and umbilical regions, or altogether in the latter. Finally, and extent, it descends, on the left side, through the regions corresponding with those it occupied on the right, and forms a remarkable bend (sig- moid flexure) in the left iliac fossa; then becoming straighter (rectum) it passes through the pelvis to end on the surface of the body. It is divided into six parts, viz., csecum, ascending colon, trans- Divisions, verse colon, descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum. The ccecum (caput caecum coli; fig. U4, cce) is placed in the Caecum: right iliac fossa, above the outer half of Poupart's ligament. When position •DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 470 relations ; peritoneum around it. Junction of ileum.

The caecum is as a rule entirely surrounded by peritoneum, which sometimes forms a small fold (meso-caecum) behind it ; but occasionally it is closely bound clown by the peritoneum being reflected off on each side, so as to leave the hinder surface uncovered, and connected to the iliac fascia by areolar tissue. This part of the large intestine is joined at its inner and posterior aspect by the termination of the ileum, which marks the division between the caacum and ascending colon ; and near the blind extre- mity the caecum has attached to it a slender worm-like process—the vermiform appendix. This process is usually directed upwards and inwards, under cover of the caecum, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum. The ascending colon reaches from the caecum to the under surface of the liver, where the intestine makes a bend known as the hepatic, flexure. It lies against the iliacus and quadratus lumboruni, and in its upper part along the outer border of the kidney. In front and to its inner side are the convolutions of the small intestine. The peritoneum fixes the ascending colon to the wall of the abdomen, and surrounds commonly about two-thirds of the circumference; but it may encircle the tube, and form a fold behind (ascending meso-colon). The transverse colon (fig. 144, tr c) begins at the hepatic flexure, and passes across to the left and upwards, along the great curvature of the stomach, as far as the spleen. Here another bend is formed at the junction with the descending colon, sharper than that on the right side, and named the splenic flexure. In this course the transverse colon is deeper at each end than in the middle, and thus forms the arch of the colon, which has its convexity directed forwards. Above the arch are placed the liver and gall-bladder, the stomach, and the spleen ; and below, the convolutions of the small intestine. In passing from right to left, the transverse colon first lies over the right kidney and the second part of the duodenum, and is fixed to these organs by its peritoneum, which is arranged like that of the ascending colon. But beyond the duodenum, it is only loosely attached to the back of the abdomen by a long fold of peritoneum, the transverse meso-colon (fig. 145, mc) ; while the great omentum (g om), which passes between it and the stomach, covers it in front. The descending colon extends from the spleen to the iliac crest, and is longer than the ascending part. At first it is placed deeply in the left hypochondriac region, resting against the diaphragm, and partly concealed by the stomach. Lower down, it has the small intestine in front and the quadratus lumboruni behind. Along the inner side, it is closely applied to the outer part of the left kidney. This part of the colon is smaller than either the right or the transverse portion, and is commonly less surrounded by the471 RELATIONS OF LIVER. peritoneum; its upper end is attached to the diaphragm by a special fold (pleuro-colic) of that membrane. The sigmoid flexure of the colon, beginning at the iliac crest, first Sigmoid; descends in the left iliac fossa, over the ilio-psoas muscle and the external iliac vessels, being fixed in this position by the peritoneum, until it reaches the brim of the pelvis. Here the intestine forms a forms a large loop, which is provided with a long process of peritoneum— ^Sesln10 the sigmoid meso-colon, and is therefore freely moveable. The loop position j commonly hangs down in the cavity of the pelvis; but it often projects forwards in the iliac fossa, and reaches the anterior wall of the abdomen. Opposite the brim of the pelvis, in the neighbour- ending, hood of the left sacro-iliac articulation, it ends in the rectum. The rectum, or the termination of the large intestine, is con- Rectum, tained in the pelvis, and will be examined in the dissection of that cavity. The liver (fig. 144) is situate in the right hypochondriac and Position or the epigastric regions, and often reaches slightly into the left ner' hypochondriac. It is covered in front by the ribs with their car- tilages, except over a small area in the subcostal angle. Folds of peritoneum, called ligaments, attach it to'the abdominal parietes. The upper surface fits against the diaphragm, and is convex on each surfaces, side, but sbghtly hollowed in the centre below the heart: the right upper portion is more prominent than the left, and reaches to the level of the fourth intercostal space. This surface is divided into two parts, corresponding to the right and left lobes of the organ, by the falciform ligament. The lower surface looks also somewhat backwards ; it is in con- and lower; tact with the stomach, the first and second parts of the duodenum, the small omentum, the right kidney, and the beginning of the transverse colon. To this surface the small omentum, containing the hepatic vessels, is attached. The anterior border is thin and db'ected downwards. On the anterior right side it is concealed by the ribs ; but in the epigastric region bordor; it is exposed, running obbquely from the ninth right to the eighth left costal cartilage : it crosses the middle line of the body about a hand's-breadth below the xiphi-sternal articulation. The fundus of the gall-bladder (fig. 144, gb) projects beyond this edge, close to the ninth costal cartilage of the right side. Posteriorly, the liver has the following relations, but they cannot posterior all be seen at present :—The left lobe lies in front of the oesophagus, ielatio118 of and is attached to the diaphragm by a triangular fold of peritoneum left lobe' —the left lateral ligament. The two layers of peritoneum fixing and of the right lobe are for the most part widely separated, and constitute ri8ht lol,e- the coronary ligament; but at the right end they come together, and give rise to a small triangular fold which is distinguished as the right lateral ligament. The portion of the surface between the layers of the coronary ligament is adherent directly to the diaphragm by means of areolar tissue: in this space also the left suprarenal capsule touches the liver; and the inferior vena cava is embedded in a deep groove in its substance (fig. 158).472 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

Kidney: situation : relations common to both, and special of right, of left. Pancreas later. The liver changes its situation with the ascent and descent of the diaphragm in respiration; for in inspiration it descends, and in expiration it regains its former level. In the upright and sitting postures also, it descends lower than in the horizontal condition of the body ; so that when the trunk is erect, the anterior border may- be felt below the edge of the ribs, but when the body is reclined, it is withdrawn within the margin of the thorax. The spleen is deeply placed behind the stomach, at the back of the hypochondrium and the adjoining part of the epigastric region. It lies very obliquely, the upper end being near the spine, while the lower end reaches about half-way round the side of the body. Its outer or posterior surface is convex and free ; it touches the diaphragm opposite the ninth, tenth and eleventh ribs. The anterior surface is concave and applied to the stomach, to which it is attached by the gastro-splenic omentum (fig. 146, g s om) ; the tail of the pancreas also touches the lower end of this surface. A third narrow surface, the internal, lies against the outer border of the left kidney in its upper half; and a fold of peritoneum, called the lieno-renal ligament (fig. 146, I r), which contains the splenic vessels, passes between the two. The upper end of the spleen is close to the suprarenal capsule ; the lower end rests on the splenic flexure of the colon and the pleuro-colic ligament. Dissection. The kidney should be examined on the left side of the body, so that the duodenum may not be displaced. In order to see it, the peritoneum and descending colon must be separated from the abdominal wall ; and its casing of fat shoidd be torn through with the fingers. The kidney is situate at the back of the abdomen, opposite the last dorsal and upper two or three lumbar vertebrae, and occupies parts of the epigastric, hypochondriac, umbilical and lumbar regions. Its position is somewhat oblique, the upper end being nearer to the spine than the lower ; and the surface which is called anterior looks much outwards. The viscus lies behind the peritoneum, and is surrounded with fat. It rests upon the diaphragm, the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. Its upper end supports the suprarenal body ; and at the inner border the vessels enter, and the duct (ureter) leaves the organ. Differences on tlie two sides. The right kidney is placed rather lower than the left; it reaches as high as the last intercostal space, while its fellow rises to the upper border of the eleventh rib. The right kidney has in front of it the liver and transverse colon, with the second part of the duodenum along its inner border ; and the hepatic flexure of the colon lies against its outer border below. The left kidney has the stomach and pancreas in front, and the spleen and descending colon along its outer side. The relations of the pancreas may be omitted for the present; they will be found on p. 486.EEFLECTIONS OF PERITONEUM. 473 THE PERITONEUM. This is the largest serous membrane in the body.

It lines the wall of the abdomen (parietal peritoneum), and is reflected over the several viscera (visceral peritoneum), some of which it invests completely, except where the vessels enter. The surfaces; inner surface is free and smooth ; but the outer is rough, when it is detached from the parts to which it is naturally adherent. The membrane, as it passes from viscus to viscus, or from the abdominal wall to viscera, forms processes or folds, to which different names are folds, given, and which for the most part consist of two layers enclosing vessels. The continuity of the sac may be traced both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal circle round the lovjer part of the abdomen. From the Circle of the umbilicus the peritoneum may be followed along the abdominal wall ^f^s™8 on the left side to the hinder part of the lumbar region, where it umbilicus, partly surrounds the descending colon, and thence over the kidney to the front of the spine. Here it is reflected forwards along the superior mesenteric vessels, passes round the small intestine, and returns to the spine along the same vessels, thus forming the mesen- tery. From the spine it is continued in the same way on the right side, over the kidney, round the colon, and along the wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus again. Vertical circles (fig. 145). Starting at the under surface of the circles from liver, the small omentum (s cm) is found descending to the small curva- ab0Te down: ture of the stomach, where the two layers of which it consists sepa- omental rate to enclose that organ, one passing in front and the other behind. la>ers' At the great curvature they meet again, and give rise to the great omentum or epiploon (g om). After descending to the lower part of the abdomen, they bend backwards and ascend to the transverse colon, which they enclose in the same way as the stomach ; and they are then continued to the posterior abdominal wall, forming the transverse meso-colon (m c). Opposite the lower border of the pan- transverse creas these two layers, which have been followed from the liver to mes°-colon '> the spine, part company,—the one passing upwards, and the other downwards.* The ascending layer is continued in front of the pancreas and its ascend- ing layer; * In the foetus at an early period the reflected portion of the great omentum is continued up to the spine ; and while the anterior layer ascends over the pancreas as explained in the text, the posterior or descending layer surrounds the transverse colon before passing into the mesentery, thus forming a transverse meso-colon distinct from the great omentum. The front of the transverse meso-colon then becomes adherent to the opposed part of the great omentum, so that the two are united in a single process, and the colon appears to be enclosed between the omental layers. Occasionally traces of the fcetal condition are met with in the adult.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. mesentery; in pelvis ; Fig. 145* along front of abdomen.

The descending layer immediately passes off along the superior mesenteric vessels to the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), forming the mesentery (m) as hefore explained in tracing the horizontal circle. From the root of the mesentery, this layer de- scends over the lower end of the aorta and the pro- montory of the sacrum to the pelvis, where it partly invests the viscera of that cavity. Thus, it sur- rounds the upper part of the rectum, and attaches that to the front of the sacrum by the meso-rec- tum ; from the rectum it is reflected forwards to the bladder in the male, or the uterus in the female, forming a pouch between the two ; and after cover- ing the upper part of the bladder, it passes off at the front and sides to the abdominal wall, forming the fossae before noticed in the inguinal region (p. 462). Lastly, the membrane is continued upwards, lining the anterior wall of the abdomen, and the under surface of the diaphragm nearly to the spine ; there it is reflected over the upper surface of the liver, and then turning round to the under surface it joins the anterior layer of the small omentum. In the foregoing account it will be seen that two vertical circles have been traced, which surround distinct cavities in the figure.

The processes uniting the stomach to other viscera are named omenta, and are three in number, viz.— the small or gastro-hepatic omentum, the large or gastro-colic omen- tum, and the gastro-splenic omentum. The small omentum (figs. 145 and 146, som) stretches between the liver and stomach, and ends towards the right in a free border, behind which the foramen of Winslow leads into the cavity of the small bag. It is attached above to the liver along the transverse fissure and the posterior half of the longitudinal fissure (fig. 158, so) ; below to the small curvature of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum. At its left or posterior end it is fixed to the diaphragm for a short distance, between the liver and the termina- tion of the oesophagus. The part between the longitudinal fissure of the liver and the small curvature is very thin, and can be sepa- rated into two layers only in the immediate neighbourhood of the viscera; but that extending from the transverse fissure to the duodenum is much thicker, and encloses the hepatic artery, portal vein, common bile-duct, and nerves and lymphatics of the liver. The great omentum (fig. 145, g om) is the largest fold of the peri- toneum, and results from the meeting of two laj'ers which leave the great curvature of the stomach, and the first part of the duodenum. The sheet thus formed descends in front of the intestine, extending farther on the left side than the right, and at the lower part of the abdomen is doubled backwards to join the transverse colon. The fold therefore encloses the lower part of a space (cavity of the small bag), which originally extended to its lower border; but in the adult the anterior and posterior portions of the omentum are iisually closely adherent, and the cavity seldom exists below the transverse colon. Between the layers of the great omentum, especially near the stomach, are some branches of vessels, minute nerves, and a variable quantity of fat; but over the greater part of their extent the layers are inseparably united, and the resulting membrane is very thin, and in places cribriform. Cavity of the small bag or sac of the omentum. By dividing the fore part of the great omentum near the stomach, this cavity will be opened, and the hand may be introduced to ascertain its extent. In front it is bounded by the anterior part of the great omentum, the stomach, the small omentum, and the Spigelian lobe of the liver.477 PERITONEAL FOLDS ON INTESTINE. Behind it are the posterior part of the great omentum, the transverse colon and meso-colon, the pancreas, the left kidney and suprarenal capsule, and the diaphragm. To the right it extends as far as the and extent, inner border of the duodenum (second part), and to the left as far as the spleen.

The foramen of Winslow is bounded in front by tbe right portion Boundaries of the small omentum, containing the hepatic vessels ; below are of winslow. the same vessels and the first part of tbe duodenum ; above is the caudate lobe of the liver ; and behind, the inferior vena cava. The gastro-splenic omentum (fig. 146, gs om) reaches from the ®*^™~ back of the stomach to the front of the spleen, and is continued below omentum, into the great omentum. Between its layers are the gastric branches of the splenic vessels. Folds of the large intestine. The disposition of the peritoneum ^g0^6*1 round the several portions of the colon has been explained in giv- large * ing their relations (p. 469). The following processes pass between mtestme: the large intestine and the abdominal wall :— The transverse meso-colon (fig. 145, m c) extends from the lower transverse 111GSO-C01011 * border of the pancreas to the transverse colon, to the left of the spot where the latter crosses the duodenum, and contains tbe middle colic vessels. In the adult it is formed by a continuation of the omental layers, but in the foetus it was a distinct process of peri- toneum (p. 473). The upper end of the left colon has a distinct fold—pleuro-colic or j?^™"00^0 costo-colic, fixing it to the wall of the abdomen. Attached by a wide end to the diaphragm opposite the tenth and eleventh ribs, it passes transversely inwards to the colon, and forms the lower boundary of a hollow in which the spleen rests. The sigmoid meso-colon is a long process of the serous membrane, sigmoid which attaches the loop of the sigmoid flexure to the brim of the pelvis : it contains the sigmoid vessels. The meso-rectum contains the superior haemorrhoidal vessels, and and mes°- attaches the upper part of the rectum to the front of the sacrum. In some bodies the ascending and descending colon are surrounded sometimes by peritoneum, which meets behind the gut and forms a fold—the ing or ascending or descending meso-colon, between it and the abdominal wall, ^-coi™, The caecum may also be provided with a similar fold (meso-cazcum) °r meso- attaching it to the right iliac fossa (p. 469). ccecum.

The second part is covered in front, except at the spot where it is crossed by the transverse colon. And the last part, which crosses the aorta, is separated from the peritoneum in the middle by the superior mesenteric vessels (fig. 145), but is covered in front by the serous membrane on each side of them. In many cases the peritoneum extends inwards behind the end of the duode- num, forming a recess or pouch to which the name of duodenojeju- nal fossa has been given. Fold of the jejunum and ileum,. The mesentery supports the rest of the small intestine, and is stronger than any other piece of the serous membrane. Its hinder end is narrow, and is attached along the front of the spine and great vessels from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right sacro-iliac articulation. The other end of the fold is wide, and is connected with the intestine. Ligaments of the liver. On the upper surface of the liver is the suspensory ligament; and along the back there is a wide process which is divided into coronary, and right and left lateral ligaments. The suspensory or falciform ligament extends from before back- wards between the upper convex surface of the liver and the parietes of the abdomen. Its lower border is concave, and fixed to the liver; while the upper border is convex, and is connected to the abdo- minal wall on the right of the linea alba, and to the under surface of the diaphragm. In its free anterior border or base is the remains of the umbilical vein, which is named the round ligament of the liver. The coronary ligament is placed at the back of the right lobe of the liver, and is composed of two layers which are separated by an interval (p. 471). The superior layer passes from the liver to the diaphragm; but the inferior layer (fig. 158, id) is reflected over the front of the kidney and inferior vena cava. This layer becomes continuous round the Spigelian lobe with the posterior layer of the small omentum. The right lateral ligament (fig. 158, rll) is a small fold at the right end of the coronary ligament, formed by the meeting of the two layers for a short distance. The left lateral ligament, larger than the foregoing, is a triangular fold of peritoneum, with a free edge turned to the left. It is attached by its anterior border to the liver above the margin of the left lobe ; and by its posterior border to the diaphragm in front of the oesophageal opening. At its right end the upper layer is con- tinued into the left side of the falciform ligament, and the lower layer into the front of the small omentum.

After these have been examined, and the relations of the aorta and vena cava have been learnt, most of the intestine can be taken out to give room for the display of the viscera and vessels in the upper part of the abdomen.479 SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. Mesenteric Vessels. The superior and inferior mesenteric Mesenteric arteries are two large branches of the aorta, which supply the intestine, except a part of the duodenum and the lower end of the rectum. Each is accompanied by a vein, and by a plexus of the sympathetic nerve. Dissection (fig. 147). For the dissection of the superior mesen- Dfi^eo^?"r teric vessels and nerves, the transverse colon and the great omen- mesenteric turn are to be placed on the margin of the ribs, and one layer vessels, (anterior or right) of the mesentery is to be removed. While trac- ing the branches of the artery to the small intestine, corresponding veins and slender offsets of the sympathetic nerve on the arteries will be met with. Mesenteric glands and lacteal vessels also come into view at the same time. The branches from the right side of the vessel to the large intes- tine are to be next followed under the peritoneum ; and after all the branches have been cleaned, the trunk of the artery should be and nerves, traced back beneath the pancreas. The surrounding plexus of nerves should be also defined. The SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY (fig. 147, a) supplies wholly Superior the small intestine beyond the duodenum, and half the large intes- ™.tetytenC tine, viz., as far as the end of the transverse colon. Arising from the aorta near the diaphragm, the vessel is directed courses in downwards between the layers of the mesentery, forming an arch g^"—. with the convexity to the left side, and terminates in offsets to the end of the small intestine. At first the artery lies beneath the pancreas relations, and the splenic vein ; and as it descends to the mesentery it is placed in front of the duodenum and the left renal vein. It is surrounded by a plexus of nerves, and accompanied by the vein of the same name. Branches. The artery furnishes a small offset to the pancreas and and duodenum, intestinal branches to the jejunum and ileum, and colic branches- branches to the large intestine. The inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery (&) is small, and Pancreatico- usually arises in common with the first intestinal branch. It is duodenal- directed to the right between the pancreas and duodenum, to both of which it supplies branches, and anastomoses with the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery from the hepatic. b.

This process is repeated four or five times between the origin and the distribution, but at each branching the size of the vessels diminishes. From the last set of arches twigs distribution are sent to the intestine on both aspects of the tube, and anastomose on the gut round it.

The chyliferous lymphatics vessels of the small intestine, and the absorbents of the part of thern!Ug the large intestine supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, pass through the mesenteric glands in their course to the thoracic duct. Along the side of the ascending and the transverse colon are a few Meso-colic other small lymphatic glands, meso-colic, which receive some absorb- glands- cnts of the large intestine. Dissection (fig. 148). By drawing the small intestine over to the Dissection right side, the dissector will observe the inferior mesenteric artery mesenteric on the front of the aorta, a little above the bifurcation. The peri- artery, toneum should be removed from its surface, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intes- tine : a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be dis- sected afterwards. On the artery and its branches the inferior mesenteric plexus of nerves ramifies.

The INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY (fig. 148, b) Supplies branches Inferior to the large intestine beyond the transverse colon, and communica- arte'iy^™ ting with the superior mesenteric, continues the chain of anastomoses along the intestinal tube. This vessel is of smaller size than the superior mesenteric, and origin, arises from the aorta from one to two inches above the bifurcation.

The remaining portion of the sympathetic nerve in the abdomen will be subsequently referred to (p. 491). Dissection. On the two mesenteric arteries the dissector will have Dissection already made out the plexuses of nerves distributed to the intes- 0 tinal tube beyond the duodenum. He lias now to trace on the aorta the connecting nerves between and the mesenteric plexuses, by taking the peritoneum from the aorta l)lexus'an below the pancreas. From the upper part of the aortic plexus an offset is to be followed along the spermatic artery ; this may be done on the left side, where the vessel is partly laid bare. By detaching the peritoneum below the bifurcation of the "aorta, hypogastric and following downwards over the iliac arteries the nerves from the p exus" aortic plexus and the lumbar ganglia, the dissector will arrive at the hypogastric plexus, above the promontory of the sacrum.

The nerves surround closely the trunk and larger branches is on artery. of the artery ; but near the intestine some of them leave the vessels, °^a™e and divide and communicate before entering the gut.

The aortic plexus is an open network of nerves covering the aorta Aortic plexus is below the superior mesenteric artery; it is stronger on the sides between than the front of the aorta, in consequence of its receiving acces- ^teriesf"0 sory branches from the lumbar ganglia, especially the left. Above, the plexus derives an offset, on each side of the aorta, from the solar and renal plexuses. It ends below, on each side, in branches offsets, which cross the common iliac artery, and enter the hypogastric plexus. From it offsets are furnished to the spermatic and inferior mesenteric arteries. The spermat ic plexus, formed by roots from both the aortic and the Spermatic renal plexus, runs on the spermatic artery to the testicle; in the cord plexus: it joins other filaments on the vas deferens. In the female, the nerves on the ovarian (spermatic) artery are in female, furnished to the ovary and the uterus. The inferior mesenteric plexus supplies the part of the intestinal Inferior tube to which its artery is distributed. This plexus is furnished from the left side of the aortic plexus ; and the nerves composing it are whiter and larger than in either of the preceding plexuses of the sympathetic. Near the sigmoid flexure the branching of the nerves join nerves and the union of contiguous twigs are well marked.

Before the viscera are removed from the hody, the relations of the abdominal aorta and vena cava may he learnt. Dissection. To see the aorta above the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, it will he necessary to detach the great omentum from the stomach, without injuring the gastro-epiploic arteries along the great curvature ; and after raising the stomach, to remove the peritoneum from the surface of the pancreas. A short arterial trunk (cceliac axis) above the pancreas is not to be quite cleaned now, otherwise the nerves about it would be destroyed. The vena cava on the right side of the aorta may be followed up as far as the liver, where it disappears. The relations of its upper end can be better observed after the dissection of the vessels of the liver. The aorta enters the abdomen between the pillars of the dia- phragm, and divides into the common iliac arteries opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra. At its beginning the vessel lies somewhat to the left of the middle line ; and it commonly inclines slightly inwards as it descends. In the abdomen the aorta is covered at first by the pancreas, then by the third part of the duodenum, and for a short distance below by the peritoneum. Beneath the pancreas it is crossed by the splenic vein above the superior mesenteric artery, and by the left renal vein below that vessel ; and the solar and aortic plexuses of the sympathetic lie along its anterior surface throughout. It rests on the lumbar vertebra;, with the pillars of the diaphragm embracing it at the beginning. To its right side is the vena cava. For its relation to other deep parts, see p. 527. The inferior vena cava begins opposite the fifth lumbar vertebra by the union of the common iliac veins, and reaches thence to the heart. The venous trunk is placed on the front of the vertebral column, to the right of the aorta. It lies close to the aorta, and is concealed by the same viscera as high as the eras of the diaphragm ; but above that spot it is inclined away from the artery, and ascending in front of the diaphragm, is embedded in the back of the liver for about an inch and a half. Lastly, it leaves the abdomen by an aperture in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, on the right of, and higher than, the aortic opening. Its relations with vessels are not the same as those of the aorta. Beneath it are the right lumbar, renal, capsular, and diaphragmatic arteries ; and crossing over it below the kidney is the spermatic. Superficial to it beneath the pancreas is the beginning of the portal vein.DUODENUM AND PANCREAS. RELATIONS OF THE DUODENUM AND PANCREAS. Dissection. To see satisfactorily the duodenum and the pancreas, Rwnors the intestinal tube beyond the duodenum is to be removed in the following way :—A double ligature is to be placed on the upper part of the jejunum, another on the lower end of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and the gut is to be cut through between the pieces of string where it is tied. The detached piece of the intestinal tube is to he taken away by cutting through the vessels, and the peritoneum connecting it to the wall of the abdomen. After it has been separated, it is to be set aside for future study while the body is turned. The student should moderately inflate the stomach and duodenum to sec the 1 J from the cut extremity of the latter, and remove the loose peritoneum c uoaenum> and the fat : while cleaning them, he should lay bare the larger vessels and nerves. On turning upwards the stomach, the pancreas may be traced and »an- froni the spleen on the one side to the duodenum on the other creas> (tig. 149). By pulling forwards the duodenum, the common bile- w,th dl"'f- duct may be found behind, between the intestine and the head of the pancreas ; and some of the pancreas may afterwards be removed, to show its duct entering the duodenum. Duodenum (fig. 149, d). The first part of the small intestine, Duodenum : or the duodenum, begins at the pyloric end of the stomach, and extent; crossing the spinal column, ends at the duodeno-jejunal flexure (p. 469), on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. It makes course and a curve roimd the head of the pancreas, and is placed in the epi- situatio" • gastric and umbilical regions of the abdomen. From its winding course round the pancreas it is divided into three portions, as division, follows :— The first or superior portion is nearly horizontal, and is free and First part is moveable like the stomach. It measures about two inches in length, ^'moTeabie1 and is directed backwards from the pylorus to near the upper end of '°V " ' the right kidney. Above and in front are the liver and gall- bladder ; below is the head of the pancreas ; and behind it are the common bile-duct, the portal vein, and the gastro-duodenal artery. The second ovmidJ.e portion, about three inches in length, descends Second part to the level of the third lumbar vertebra), and is fixed almost indexed'' mimoveably by the peritoneum and the pancreas. In front of it are the liver and transverse colon ; behind it the inner border of the kidney and the renal vessels ; and on its inner side the head of the pancreas, with the common bile-duct The ducts of the liver and pancreas open into this part of the duodenum. The third or inferior portion is the longest of all : it first crosses Third parti, from right to left opposite the third lumbar vertebra, and then lonscst. ascends for a short distance on the surface of the left psoas muscle ata° to its termination in the jejunum. It lies in front of the vena cava and aorta, and its anterior surface is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels. Above it is the pancreas.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 486 Pancreas situation and form relations, of surfaces, The peritoneal relations of the duodenum have been noticed at p. 477. Pancreas (fig. 149, e). The pancreas is situate behind the stomach, extending from the duodenum to the spleen, and occupying parts of the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. In form it is elongated, with its right portion much expanded from above down, constituting the bead ; this part lies in front of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, the great vessels intervening. The gland is covered in front by peritoneum derived from the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. Its anterior surface is for the most part concave, corresponding to the stomach ; but in front of the spine it forms a projection (omental tuberosity, His) opposite the small curvature and lesser omentum. Posteriorly it is in contact with the vena cava, aorta, pillars of the diaphragm, left kidney and renal vessels, splenic vein and beginning of the vena portse. Projecting above the pancreas, where it crosses the aorta, is the cceliac axis, from which the splenic artery runs to the left along the upper border; while on the right side the hepatic artery and the first part of the duodenum lie above it. At the lower border is the third part of the duodenum ; and the superior mesenteric vessels emerge between the two. and of ends. The head of the pancreas is received into the concavity of the duodenum ; and the common bile-duct lies between the two for a short distance behind.

The Cceliac Axis (fig. 149, c) is the first visceral branch of the Coeliacaxis abdominal aorta, and arises close to the upper margin of the opening threefoV*6 in the diaphragm. It is a short thick trunk, about half an inch ^wing :— long, which projects above the upper border of the pancreas, and is surrounded by the solar plexus of the sympathetic. Its branches— coronary, hepatic, and splenic—radiate from the trunk (whence the name axis) to their distribution to the surrounding viscera. The coronary artery (d) is the smallest of the three, and runs Coronary, upwards between the peritoneum and diaphragm to the cardiac whicu gives orifice of the stomach. Having furnished some oesophageal branches, it then bends downwards, and passes between the layers of the small omentum, along the small curvature of the stomach, to anastomose with the pyloric branch (o) of the hepatic artery. Its offsets are thus distributed : — a. (Esophageal branches ascend on the gullet through the opening offsets to in the diaphragm, and anastomose with branches of the descending thoracic aorta. b. Gastric branches are given to both sides of the stomach, and those and the on the left end communicate with twigs (vasa brevia) of the splenic stomach- artery. The splenic artery (e) is the largest branch of the cceliac axis Splenic in the adult. It is a tortuous vessel, and runs almost horizontally artery to the spleen along the upper border of the pancreas. Near the spleen it divides into terminal branches, about seven in number (from four to ten), which enter that viscus by the surface towards supplies the the stomach. It is accompanied by the splenic vein, which is below sPleen' it; and it distributes branches to the pancreas and the stomach. a. Pancreatic branches.

This artery distributes twigs to both surfaces of the stomach, and between the pieces of peritoneum forming the great omentum. The hepatic artery (g) is intermediate in size between the Hepatic other two, and is encircled by the largest plexus of nerves.

Splenic vein : The coronary vein accompanies the artery of the same name along the small curvature of the stomach, and hending downwards at the cardia, passes to the lower end of the portal vein. The pyloric vein (fig. 150, /) lies with the pyloric hranch of the hepatic artery along the lower part of the small curvature of the stomach, and opens into the portal vein opposite the duodenum. The splenic vein (fig. 150) is of large size, and is formed by the union of branches from the spleen. It runs below the artery, and under cover of the pancreas, to the front of the vena cava, where it joins the superior mesenteric vein (6) to form the vena portse. tributaries. Between its origin and termination it receives branches corre- sponding with the following arteries,—vasa brevia (g), left gastro- epiploic (e), and pancreatic. The inferior mesenteric vein (d) some- times opens into it. The portal vein (vena portte ; fig. 150, a) is formed by the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Its origin is placed behind the head of the pancreas, and in front of the inferior vena cava. The vessel is about three inches long, and ascends beneath the first part of the duodenum, and then between the layers of the small omentum, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into a right and a left branch. While in the small omentum it lies behind the hepatic artery and bile-duct. The right branch is shorter and larger than the left, and ramifies in the right lobe of the liver. The left branch gives an offset to the Spigelian lobe, and enters the left half of the liver. In its course the portal trunk is joined by the coronary and pyloric veins from the stomach; and the cystic vein from the gall-bladder enters the right branch. This vein commences by roots in some viscera of the abdomen, like any other vein, but it is deficient in valves ; and it ramifies through the structure of the liver in the same manner as an artery. Its radicles communicate with the systemic veins on some parts of the intestinal tube, but more particularly on the rectum. Bile-ducts. Two hepatic ducts issue at the transverse fissure of the liver (fig. 158), one from the right and the other from the left lobe, and unite to form the following :—- The common hepatic duct is an inch and a half long, and receives at its termination the duct of the gall-bladder, the union of the two giving origin to the common bile-duct. The common bile-duct (ductus communis choledochus) is about three inches long. It descends almost vertically beneath the upper portion of the duodenum ; then passing between the pancreas and the vertical piece of the duodenum, it opens into this portion of the intestine at the inner side, and about the middle. While in the small omentum the duct lies to the right of the hepatic artery, and somewhat before the portal vein. As it pierces the wall of the intestine it is joined commonly by the pancreatic duct, but the two may enter the duodenum sepa- rately.

In the abdomen, as in the thorax, the General to- sympathetic nerve consists of a gangliated cord on each side of the Serves"." ° vertebral column, and of prevertebral centres or plexuses, which furnish branches to the viscera. The chief prevertebral plexuses in the abdomen are the epigastric J,n°]^agrge or solar and the hypogastric. The epigastric plexus is placedcen ' behind the stomach, and supplies nerves to all the viscera above the eP18astrlc cavity of the pelvis : it is continued downwards to the hypogastric andhypo- plexus by the aortic plexus (p. 483). The hypogastric plexus dis- gas nc- tributes nerves to the pelvic viscera, and has already been noticed (p. 483). The knotted or gangliated cord will be met with in a subsequent stage of the dissection ; and only the great solar plexus with its offsets is to be now examined. Dissection. To denude the epigastric plexus, the following dissec- ^°gVst0°lalay' tion is to be made :—After the air has been let out of the stomach p]eXus,' and- duodenum, the portal vein, the common bile-duct, and the gastro-duodenal artery are to be cut through near the pylorus ; and the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas are to be drawn over to the left side. On raising the liver, the vena cava appears ; this is to be cut across above the junction of the renal veins with it, and the lower end is to be drawn down with hooks. Beneath the vein the dissector will find the large reddish semi- and the lunar ganglion of the right side ; and mixed up with the nerves of the ganglia!*"" plexus are numerous lymphatic glands (coeliac glands), with a dense tissue, which require to be removed with care. From its inner part he can trace the numerous nerves and ganglia around the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries, and the secondary plexuses on the branches of those arteries. From the outer part of the ganglion offsets are to be followed to the kidney, the suprarenal body, and the diaphragmatic arteries. At its upper end the junction with the large splanchnic nerve may be seen ; and deeper than the last, one or two smaller splanchnic nerves may be found as they issue through a fissure of the diaphragm, and throw themselves into the coeliac and renal plexuses. The student should then trace the ending of the pneumo-gastric Follow the nerves on the stomach. The left nerve will be found at the small g£ curvature in front, near the oesophagus ; and the right nerve will nerves, be seen at a corresponding spot on the opposite aspect. Branches from the right nerve are to be followed to the plexus of the sympa- thetic by the side of the coeliac axis ; and from the left, to the hepatic plexus. The epigastric or solar plexus is a large network of nerves Solar and ganglia, which lies in front of the aorta and pillars of the pIeXtts: diaphragm, and behind the pancreas and inferior cava : it fills the appearance space between the suprarenal capsules of opposite sides, and sur- and exteilt; rounds the coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric artery.

Large branches are furnished to the different nace: i along the vessels. The semilunar ganglia, one in each half of the plexus, are the largest in the body, and are placed close to the. suprarenal capsules, resting on the diaphragm : the ganglion of the right side is beneath the vena cava. At the upper end each is joined by the great splanchnic nerve. The mass is irregular in shape, and often divided into smaller ganglia ; from its outer side nerves are directed to the kidney and the suprarenal capsule. Offsets of the plexus. The nerves supplied to the viscera form plexuses round the vessels ; thus, there are cocliac, mesenteric, renal, spermatic, diaphragmatic plexuses, &c. The diaphragmatic or phrenic plexus comes from the upper end of the semilunar ganglion, but it soon leaves the artery to enter the substance of the diaphragm : a communication takes place between the phrenic nerve of the cervical plexus and these branches of the sympathetic. On the right side is a small ganglion where the plexus is joined by the spinal nerve ; and from it filaments are supplied to the vena cava and the suprarenal body : this ganglion is absent on the left side (Swan). The suprarenal nerves are very large and numerous, in comparison with the size of the viseus supplied, and are directed outwards to the suprarenal body. One of the splanchnic nerves communicates with this plexus. The renal plexus is derived from the semilunar ganglion and outer side of the solar plexus, and is joined by the smallest splanchnic nerve. The nerves surround the renal artery, having small ganglia on them, and enter the kidney with the vessels. An offset is given from the renal to the spermatic plexus (p. 483). The cceliac plexus is a direct continuation of the plexus around its artery : it is joined by the small splanchnic nerve on each side, and by a branch from the right pneumo-gastric nerve. The plexus- divides like the artery into three offsets—coronary, splenic, and hepatic. a. The coronary plexus accompanies the vessel of the same name- to the stomach : it communicates with the left vagus nerve. b. The splenic plexus furnishes nerves to the pancreas, and to the stomach along the left gastro-epiploic artery; and it is joined by an offset from the right pneumo-gastric nerve. c. The hepatic plexus is continued on the vena porta?, the hepatic artery, and the bile-duct into the liver, and ramifies on those vessels : in the small omentum the plexus is joined by offsets from the left vagus. The following secondary plexuses are furnished around the branches of the hepatic artery, and have the same name and dis- tribution as the vessels : A pyloric plexus courses along the small curvature of the stomach. Two other plexuses—right gaslro-epiplotc and pancreatico-duodenal, correspond in distribution with the branches of each artery. A cystic plexus passes to the gall-bladder with the artery.493 ENDING OF FNEUM0-GAST1UC NERVES. The remaining offsets of the plexus, viz., superior and inferior mesenteric, aortic, and spermatic, have been already noticed (p. 483); bat the derivation of the superior mesenteric and aortic plexuses from the epigastric centre can be now seen. Ending of the splanchnic nerves. The large nerve perforates the Ef"j^| cms of the diaphragm, and generally ends altogether in the semi- splanchnic , ,. nerve, lunar ganglion. The small nerve comes through the same opening in the diaphragm small, as the preceding, and joins the cceliac plexus.

Dissection. Most of the viscera are now to be l-emoved from the ^*/^rutf^ abdomen, in order that the body may be turned for the dissection bod™ by of the back. The stomach and the spleen, with the duodenum and the pancreas, removing 1 ' iiii the viscera, are to be taken away together by cutting through the oesophagus near the diaphragm, as well as the vessels and nerves they receive. The liver is to be removed from the abdomen by dividing its liga- ments, and cutting the vena cava below the diaphragm. At the same time the left testicle, and the right kidney with the suprarenal body, should be removed for examination while the body is turned; the former can be taken out by cutting through the spermatic cord, and the latter by dividing its vessels about the middle. Directions. Supposing the body to be now turned for the dissec- Directions tion of the back, and to lie with the face downwards for the usual fulseetor. time, the dissector may look first to the fascia lumborum, which is described in Chapter V, p. 386.

The muscu- lar coat is made up of longi- tudinal, circular, rately, and the surface cleaned ; but, previously, let the student detach the spleen, and cut through the duodenum close to the pylorus. Form and divisions. The stomach is rather pyriform in shape, and in its natural condition strongly curved (fig. 144). Its Bize varies much in different bodies, and is sometimes much diminished by a constriction to the right of the centre : when it is moderately distended, it is about twelve inches long and four- wide. There are two ends, two orifices, two surfaces, and two borders or curvatures to be examined. The left end is called the fundus or great cul-de-sac, and projects upwards to the left of the end of the oesophagus. The right or pyloric end is much smaller, and taj^ers to the duodenum. The cardiac opening, which communicates with the oesophagus, is placed two or three inches from the most prominent part of the fundus, and is funnel-shaped towards the cavity of the organ. The pyloric orifice opens into the duodenum, and is guarded internally by a muscular band (pylorus) : at this spot the stomach is slightly constricted externally, where a firm circular thickening may be felt. The anterior and posterior surfaces are somewhat flattened when the viscus is empty, but rounded when it is distended : the parts in contact with them have been referred to (p. 467). The upper border or small curvature is concave, except for a short distance at the pyloric end. The lower border or large curvature is much longer, convex, and when the organ is distended forms at the pyloric end a slight projection to the right, which has been named the small cul-de-sac. An arterial arch and a fold of peritoneum (omentum) are connected with each border. Structure. In the wall of the stomach are four coats, viz., serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous; and belonging to these there are vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. Serous coat. The peritoneum gives a covering to the stomach, and is adherent to the surface except at each margin, where an interval exists corresponding with the attachment of the small and large omentum : in those spaces are contained the vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. During distension of the stomach the spaces above mentioned are much diminished. The muscular coat will be laid bare by the removal of the serous covering. Its fibres are unstriated or involuntary, and arranged in three sets, viz., longitudinal, circular, and oblique, hi the order men- tioned from without inwards. The longitudinal fibres (fig. 151, a) are derived from the oesopha- gus ; they spread over the surface, and are continued to the pylorus and the small intestine. The fibres are most marked along the borders, particularly at the smaller one ; and at the pylorus they are stronger than in the centre of the stomach. The circular fibres (fig. 151, b) form the middle stratum, and will be best seen by removing the longitudinal fibres near the pylorus. They reach from the left to the right end of the stomach ; but at495 STRUCTURE OF STOMACH. the pylorus they are most numerous and strongest, and form a ring or sphincter (c) round the opening. The oblique fibres (fig. 151, e) are continuous with the circular or «d«W»r» deep layer of the oesophagus. On the left and right of the cardiac orifice they are so arranged as to form a kind of sphincter (d and e) (Henle) ; those on the left («), the strongest, arch over the great end of the stomach, and spread out on the anterior and posterior surfaces, gradually disappearing on them. Fibrous or submucous coat. By removing the muscular layer over ^fibrous a small space, the fihrous coat will appear as a white shining stratum but Fig. 15 J.* of areolar tissue. This coat gives strength to the stomach, and serves as a bed in which the larger vessels and nerves ramify before their distribution to the mucous layer. If a small opening is made in this membrane, the mucous coat will project through it, supposing the stomach to be distended with air. The mucous coat will come into view on cutting open the stomach, Mucous but the appearances now described can be recognised only in a eoat: recent specimen. This coat is a softish layer, of a pale rose colour soon after death, feel and in the healthy condition. In the empty state of the stomach the colour * membrane is less vascular than during digestion ; and in infancy the natural redness is greater than in childhood or old age. When folds; the stomach is contracted the membrane is thrown into numerous wavy ridges or rugm, which become longitudinal along the great curvature, towards the pylorus. The thickness of the mucous membrane is greatest near the thickness; pylorus ; and at that spot it forms a fold, opposite the muscular ring, which assists in closing the opening. If this membrane and disposition at pylorus. * Diagram representing the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the stomach. The external and middle layers are partly removed, a.

With the aid of a lens, the surface of the mucous membrane, when well washed, may be seen to be covered by shallow depressions or alveoli (fig. 152), which measure from ^th to T^th of a» inch across. Generally hexagonal or polygonal in outline, the hollows become larger and more elongated towards the small end of the stomach ; and near the pylorus the margins of the alveoli project, and become irregular. In the bottom of each depression are the apertures of minute tubular glands. supplying Blood-vessels. The arteries of the stomach are derived from the branches of the coeliac axis, and have been seen to form an arch along each curvature (p. 487). From these arches branches pass to both surfaces of the stomach, and after tin muscular coat, divide in the submucous layer into minute vessels which enter the substance of the mucous membrane. The veins have a corresponding arrangement, and pass to the portal system (p. 490). Lymphatic*. The lymphatic vessels proceeding from the stomach run with the blood-vessels, and have a few small glands connected with them along the two curvatures. Nerves. The nerves are derived from the pneumo-gastric and sym- pathetic (p. 492), and can be followed to the fibrous coat : small ganglia have been observed on them. .SMALL INTESTINE.

It is wider than either the jejunum or the ileum, and its muscular coat is also thicker. Into it the bile and pancreatic ducts pour their contents. The jejunum and the ileum together measure about twenty feet in length, and are connected with the mesentery. There is not any perceptible difference between the termination of the one and tin- beginning of the other, but two-fifths of the length are assigned to the jejunum, and three-fifths to the ileum. Between the ends, how- ever, a marked difference may be perceived ; for the upper part oi the jejunum is thicker and more vascular than the lower end of the ileum, and its width is also greater. Structure. In the small intestine the wall is formed by the same number of layers as in the stomach, viz., serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. * Alveolar depressions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, magnified 32 diameters, with the minute tubes opening into them. (Sprott Boyd.)STRUCTURE OF SMALL INTESTINE. 497 Dissection. The different layers are to be examined on pieces, Dissection about three inches long, taken from the duodenum, the upper part of the jejunum, and the lower end of the ileum. After the pieces have been cut off, they are to be distended with air ; and the serous covering is to be torn off for a short distance, to show the muscular coat, but in doing this, the external longitudinal fibres will be taken away without great care. The serous coat is closely connected with the subjacent muscular Serous coat layer. To the jejunum and ileum it furnishes a covering, except at the attached side where the vessels enter : at this spot the peri- nearly toneum is reflected off to form the mesentery, and a space exists comp 6 e' resembling that at the borders of the stomach. The peritoneum except in only partly surrounds the duodenum; this peculiarity has been denuin° described at p. 477. The muscular coat is constructed of two sets of fibres, a superficial J^u,ar or longitudinal, and a deep or circular. The fibres are pale in colour, formed by a and are not striated. The longitudinal fibres form a thin covering, which is most marked longitudina at the free border of the gut. The circular fibres are much more distinct than the others, and and a,cir' » . cuuir layer, give the chief strength to the muscular coat. Dissection.

The folds are largest and most uniform beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile-duct. The aperture of the common bile and pancreatic ducts (fig. 153, e) is a narrow orifice, from three to four inches below the pylorus, and Fig. 153.* - a where >ituate in a small prominence of the mucous membrane, at the inner and posterior part of the duodenum (p. 485). A probe passed into the bile-duct will show its oblique course (half an inch or more) under the mucous coat. Occasionally the pancreatic duct opens by a distinct orifice. To see satisfactorily the following objects, some pieces of fresh intestine will be necessary. Villi. When a piece of the lower part of the duodenum, from which the mucus is washed away, is examined in water, the mucous membrane will be seen to be thickly studded with small pro- jections, like those on velvet. These bodies exist along the whole of the small intestine, and are irregular in form (fig. 155), sum. being triangular, others conical or cylindrical with a large end. Their length is from -^a-th to ^\th of an inch ; and they are beat marked where the valvulse conniventes are largest.

The crypts of Lieberkiihn are minute simple tubes, which exist Sunpl* throughout the small intestine. They open on the surface of the mucous membrane by small orifices between the villi, and around the larger glands ; but they are not to be recognised with the naked eye white Solitary follicles: size and situation The so-called solitary glands (fig. 155, b) are roundish eminences, about the size of mustard-seed if distended, which are scattered along the small intestine, but in greatest num- ber in the ileum. Placed on all parts of the intestine, and even on or between the valvulse conniventes, they are covered by the villi of the mucous membrane, and are surrounded at their circumference by apertures of the crypts of Lieberkiihn. These small bodies are nodides of lymphoid tissue. The agminated glands or glands of Peyer (fig. 154) exist chiefly in the ileum, in the form of oval patches, which measure from half an inch to two inches or more in length, and about half an inch in ■width. They are situate on the part of the intestine opposite to the attachment of the mesentery, and their direction is longitudinal in the gut: usually they are from twenty to thirty in number. In the lower part of the ileum they are largest and most numerous ; but they decrease in number ties7 and size upwards from that spot, till at the lower end of the jejunum they become irregular in form, and may consist only of small roundish masses. The patches are most distinct in young persons, and generally disappear in old age. The mucous membrane over them is hollowed into pits (fig. 154, b), and is generally destitute of villi (fig. 155, a) ; but between the pits it has the same characters as in other parts. These patches are simply collections of lymphoid nodules of the j:?™1108'" same nature as the " sobtary glands." The Glands of Brunner are small compound bodies, similar to the g^^8 "f buccal and labial glands of the mouth, which exist in the duodenum. r or" For a distance of one or two inches near the pylorus they are most numerous, and there they are visible without a lens, being nearly as large as hemp-seed.

Arteries of the intes- tine : cuts may be previously made through the peritoneal coat. The air enters the wall of the intestine where the peritoneal covering is injured, and spreads through the whole gut ; but opposite °the solitary glands, and the patches of Peyer, the mucous coat is more closely connected with the contiguous structures, and the subjacent portion will not be distended with the air. The piece of the in- testine may be examined when it is dry. Vessels of the intestine. The arteries are derived from the intestinal Fig. 155.* branches of the superior mesenteric trunk (p. 479), and enter the wall of the intestine at the attached border. They run at first beneath the serous coat, round the side of the bowel, and give off numerous ramifications, which anastomose freely together, and per- forate the muscular coat, supplying branches to its substance. Finally, they break up into very minute twigs in the submucous layer, veins; before entering the mucous coat. The veins have their usual resemblance to the companion arteries, absorbents; The absorbents (lacteals) leave the intestine with tbe vessels and pass to the mesenteric glands (p. 481). and nerves. Nerves of the small intestine come from the upper mesenteric plexus, and entering the coats by the side of the arteries, form plexuses with interspersed ganglia.

In length this portion of the alimentary canal measures about length; five or six feet,—one-fifth of the length of the intestinal tube. The diameter of the colon is largest at the commencement of the caacuin, size, and gradually decreases as far as the upper part of the rectum: in the lower part of the rectum there is a dilatation above the anus. When compared with the small intestine, the colon is distinguished Compared by the following characters :—It is generally of greater capacity, ,sma11 . n . ... ^' gut, larger, bemg in some places as large again, and is more fixed m its position; it is also free from convolution, except in the left iliac fossa, where more fixed, it forms the sigmoid flexure. Instead of being a smooth cylindrical tube, the colon is sacculated, and is marked by three longitudinal not coiled, muscular bands, which alternate with as many rows of dilatations ; but in the rectum the surface is smooth, and the longitudinal bands disappear. Attached to the surface, especially along the transverse colon, are small processes of peritoneum containing fat—the appen- dices epiplo'icse. Dissection. For the purpose of examin- ing the large intestine, the student should cut off and blow up the csecum, with part of the ileum entering it; and he should prepare in a similar way a piece of the transverse colon, and a piece of the sigmoid flexure (about four inches of each). The areolar tissue and the fat are to be removed with care from each, after it has been inflated. . The C/ECUM, or the head of the colon f.'&tfbi.Vv^ .'.

To examine the interior of the caecum, and the valve between it and the small intestine, the specimen should be dried, and the following cuts should be made in it:—One oval piece is to be taken from the upper aspect of the ileum near its termination ; and another from the side of the caecum, opposite the entrance of the small intestine. Ileo-ccecal valve (fig. 156). This valve is situate at the entrance of the ileum into the large bowel. It is composed of two pieces, which project into the interior of the colon, and bound a narrow, nearly transverse aperture of communication between the two parts of the intestinal canal. The upper piece of the valve, ileo-colic (e), projects horizontally into the large intestine, opposite the junction of the ileum with the colon. And the lower piece, ileo-ccecal (/), which is the larger of the two, has a nearly vertical direction between the ileum and the caecum. At each extremity of the opening the pieces of the valve are blended together ; and the resulting prominence (g) extends transversely on the front and back of the intestine, forming the frozna or retinacula of the valve. The size of the opening is altered by the distension of tin- intestine ; for when the retinacula of the valve are stretched the fold* bounding the aperture are approximated, and may be made to touch. Each piece of the valve is formed by circular muscular fibres of the intestinal tube, covered by mucous membrane and submucous tissue ; as if the ileum were thrust obliquely through the wall of the caecum, after being deprived of its peritoneal coat and the layer of longitudinal fibres. This construction is easily seen on a fresh specimen by dividing the peritoneum and the longitudinal fibres, and gently drawing out the ileum from the caecum. The opening of the appendix into the caecum (d) is placed below that of the ileum. The mucous membrane partly closes the aperture and acts as a valve. Folds or ridges are directed transversely in the interior of the gut, and correspond with depressions on the outer surface : these folds result from the doubling of the wall of the intestine, and the largest enclose vessels. Structure of the colon. The coats of the large are similar to those of the small intestine, viz., serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous. Serous coat. The peritoneum does not clothe the large intestine, throughout, in the same degree. It usually surrounds the caecum, but covers only the front and sides of the ascending and descending colon (p. 477,). The transverse colon is encased like the stomach, and has intervals along the borders, where the transverse meso-colon and the great omentum are attached. The muscular coat is formed of longitudinal and circidar fibres, as in the small intestine.503 STRUCTURE OF THE COLON. The longitudinal fibres may be traced as a thin layer over the j°nt^Unal surface, but most are collected into three longitudinal bands, about bandBi a quarter of an inch in width. On the vermiform appendix the which are fibres form a uniform layer; but they are continued thence into ^pp*6,','^1 the bands on the ctecum and colon : on the rectum they are dif- and rec- f'used over the surface. When the bands are divided the intestine tum * elongates,—the sacculi and the ridges in the interior of the gut disappearing at the same time. The circular fibres are spread over the whole surface, but are and circular, most marked in the folds projecting into the intestine. In the rectum (to be afterwards seen) they form the band of the internal sphincter muscle. The fibrous or submucous coat resembles that of the small intestine, submucous It will be exposed by removing the peritoneal and muscular coverings, gnfaifgut. The mucous coat, which may be examined on opening the intes- Mucous coat tine, is smooth, and of a pale yellow colour ; and it is not thrown fo^* into special folds, except in the rectum. The surface is free from villi ; and by this circumstance the mucous membrane of the large and villi, can be distinguished from that of the small intestine. This differ- ence in the two portions of the alimentary tube is well marked on the ileo-csecal valve ; for the surface looking to the ileum is studded with villi, while the surface continuous with the mucous lining of the large intestine is free from those eminences.

It is destitute of a distinct capsule ; hut it is surrounded by areolar tissue, which projects into the interior, and connects together its smaller pieces. The lobules are soft and loose, and of a greyish white colour, and are united into larger masses by areolar tissue, vessels, and duets. The duct of the pancreas (canal of Wiisung ; fig. 153, d) extends the whole length of the gland, and is somewhat nearer the lower than the upper border. It begins in the tail of the pancreas, where it presents a bifurcated extremity ; and as it continues onwards to the head, it receives many branches. It finally ends by opening into the duodenum, usually in union with the common bile-duct (p. 498). Of the tributary branches, the largest is derived from the lower part of the head of the pancreas. The duct measures from -r^th to Yoth of an inch in diameter near the duodenum. It is formed of a fibrous coat with a very smooth mucous lining. Vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The arteries and veins have been described (p. 487) ; and the lymphatics pass to the coeliac glands. The nerves are furnished by the solar plexus. THE SPLEEN. Consistence and colour. Form and position. Size and weight. Surfaces are phrenic, gastric, and renal. Borders and extremities. Sometimes accessory spleens. Two coats and special material. The spleen is a vascular spongy organ of a bluish or purple colour, sometimes approaching to grey. Its texture is friable, and easily broken under pressure. Theviscus is somewhat elliptical in shape, and is placed obliquely behind the great end of the stomach. Its size varies much. In the adult it measures commonly about five inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and one inch to one inch and a half in thick- ness. Its weight lies between four and ten ounces, and is rather less in the female than the male. At the posterior or outer aspect it is convex towards the ribs. On the opposite side a longitudinal ridge separates an anterior or gastric surface from a narrow internal or renal surface, both of which are concave (p. 472). Just in front of the ridge is a groove, or more commonly a series of small dejuessions, where the branches of the vessels enter : this part is called the Mhm of the spleen. The anterior border is thinner than the posterior, and is often notched. Of the two extremities, the lower is more pointed than the upper. Small masses or accessory spleens (spleiiculi), varying in size from a bean to a moderate-sized plum, are found occasionally, near the hilivm of the spleen, in the gastro-splenie omentum, or in the greal omentum. Structure. Enveloping the spleen are two coverings, a serous and a fibrous. It is formed by a network of fibrous or trabecular tissue, which contains in its meshes the splenic pulp. Throughout the mass the blood-vessels and the nerves ramify. It has no duct.OBVIOUS STRUCTURE OF SPLEEN. 505 The serous or peritoneal coat encases the spleen, covering the surface except at the hilum and the ridge behind. It is closely connected to the subjacent fibrous coat. The fibrous coat (tunica propria) gives strength to the spleen, and forms a complete case for it. At the hilum this investment passes into the interior with the vessels, to which it furnishes sheaths ; and if an attempt is made to detach this coat, numerous fibrous processes will be seen to be connected with its deep surface. Its colour is whitish; and it is made up of areolar and elastic tissues. Dissection. The spongy or trabecular structure will best appear by washing and squeezing a piece of fresh bullock's spleen under water, so as to remove the inner grumous-looking material. The trabecular tissue (fig. 157) forms a network through the whole interior of the spleen, similar to that of a sponge, which is joined to the external casing, and forms sheaths around the vessels. Its processes or threads are white, flattened or cylindrical, and consist of fibrous and elastic Fig. 157.* tissues, with a few muscular fibres. The interstices communicate freely together, and contain the pulp of the spleen. The splenic pulp is a soft red-brown mass, which is lodged in the areolae of the tra- becular structure, and consists in great part of blood. In a fresh section small whitish spots (about j-^th of an inch in diameter) may be seen scattered amongst the dark pulp : these are the Malpighian corpuscles of the spleen—lymphoid nodules attached to the small branches of the artery. Blood-vessels. The larger branches of the splenic artery are surrounded by sheaths of fibrous tissue in the trabeculse ; but the smallest branches leave the sheathing, and break up into tufts of capillaries, which are said to open into the fine meshes of the spleen substance. There are few or no anastomoses between the arterial branches in the organ. The splenic vein is supposed to begin in the meshes of the splenic pulp by open channels. The small branches resulting from the union of these radicles anastomose freely together, and unite into trunks larger than the accompanying arteries, which, issue by the hilum of the spleen. Lymphatics and nerves. The lymphatics are superficial and deep, and leaving the organ at the hilum, traverse small glands lying along the splenic vessels on their way to the cceliac glands.

Upper sur- face smooth; lower sur- face uneven hinder sur- face also irregular. Anterior border thin and notched. The liver secretes the bile, and is the largest gland in the body. Its duct opens into the duodenum with that of the pancreas. Dissection (fig. 159). Preparatory to examining the liver, the vessels at the under surface should be dissected out. This proceed- ing will be facilitated by distending the vena cava and vena porta? with tow or cotton-wool, and the gall-bladder with air through its duct. The several vessels and the ducts are then to be defined, and the gall-bladder is to be cleaned. On following outwards the left branch of the portal vein to the longitudinal or antero-posterior fissure, it will be found united anteriorly with the round ligament (c) or the remains of the umbilical vein, and posteriorly with the thin fibrous remnant of the ductus venosus (ci). The liver is of a red-brown colour and firm consistence, and weighs commonly in the adult from three to four pounds. Trans- versely the gland measures from ten to twelve inches; from front to back between six and seven inches ; and in thickness, at the right end, about three inches, but this last measurement varies much with the spot examined. The natural shape of the liver when within the body is very different from the form it assumes when removed and placed on a flat surface, as may be seen by comparing fig. 158, which repre- sents the organ hardened in situ, with fig. 159. It has three surfaces—superior, inferior, and posterior,—one well-defined border —the anterior,—and two extremities. The inferior and posterior surfaces are farther subdivided into lobes by fissures which contain vessels, and marked by fossa? and impressions. The position and relations of the liver are described at p. 471, and the peritoneal ligaments at p. 478. Surfaces. On the upper aspect the liver is smooth, and marked towards the left side by a shallow impression for the heart. The suspensory ligament extends from front to back of this surface, and divides it into two unequal parts, of which the right is the larger. The under surface (fig. 158) is rendered irregular by fissures and fossa? ; in contact with it is the gall-bladder ; and a longitudinal sulcus separates the right from the left lobe. The posterior surface, which is also divided into two by a con- tinuation of the longitudinal sulcus, is broad over the right lobe, but narrow on the left. In the centre is a hollow for the spine, to the right of which the inferior vena cava is partly embedded in the liver. On the right of the cava, the surface is rough between the layers of the coronary ligament (fig. 158,*), where it was adherent to the diaphragm ; and close to the vein is a small hollow (suprarenal impression; fig. 158, sr i) into which the right suprarenal body is received.

On the posterior surface is the suprarenal impression (sr i) already referred to. The three following so-called lobes also are portions of the surface of the right lobe :— The quadrate lobe (q I) is situate between the gall-bladder and the longitudinal fissure. It reaches anteriorly to the margin of the liver, and posteriorly to the fissure (transverse) by which the vessels enter the viscus. It is impressed by the pyloric end of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. The Spigelian lobe (S I) is the part between the longitudinal fissure and the inferior vena cava, aud belongs mainly to the posterior surface of the liver. It forms the bottom of the hollow for the spine, from which it is separated by the diaphragm and the aorta; and it appears on the under aspect of the organ as a slight projection behind the transverse fissure. The caudate lobe (c Z) is a narrow, elongated eminence, which is directed from the Spigelian lobe behind the transverse fissure, so as to form the posterior boundary of that sulcus. Where the fissure terminates this projection subsides in the right lobe. Fissukes. Extending nearly half way across the right part of the ■ liver, between the Spigelian and caudate lobes on the one hand, and the quadrate lobe on the other, is the transverse or portal fissure. It is situate much nearer the back than the front, and contains the portal vein, hepatic artery, and the nerves, ducts, and lymphatics of the liver. At the left end it is united at a right angle with the longitudinal fissure. The longitudinal fissure (fig. 159, f) extends from the front to the back of the liver, between the right and left lobes. In it, anterior to the transverse fissure, lies the remnant of the umbilical vein (c), which is called the round ligament, and is oftentimes arched over by a piece of the hepatic substance (pons hepatis); and behind that fissure is a small fibrous cord (cZ), the remains of the vessel named ductus venosus in the foetus. The groove for the vena cava is placed on the right side of the Spigelian lobe, and is frequently bridged over by the liver. If the cava (a) be opened, two or three large and some smaller hepatic veins will be observed entering it. Vessels op the transverse fissure. The vessels in the transverse fissure, viz., portal vein, hepatic artery and duct, have the following position;—the duct is anterior, the portal vein posterior, and the artery between the other two. The hepatic duct (fig. 159, e) is formed by two branches,—one from the right, and one from the left lobe, which soon blend in a common tube. After a distance of one inch and a half it is joined by the duct of the gall-bladder (/) ; and the union of the two gives rise to the common bile-duct (g).VESSELS OF THE LIVER. 509 The hepatic artery (h) is divided into two for the chief lobes, and Hepatic its branches are surrounded by nerves.

After birth the part of the umbilical vein in front of °°t"^m°"h the transverse fissure is closed, and becomes eventually the round ligament (fig. 159, c) or ligamentum teres. The ductus venosus is also obliterated, only a thin cord (rf) remaining in its place. But the lateral branches remain open, and subsequently form tin: divisions of the portal vein. Occasionally the ductus venosus is found pervious for some distance. Obvious structure of the liver.

Hepatic artery and adheres closely to the fibrous coat. At certain spots intervals exist between the two, viz., in the fissures occupied by vessels, along the line of attachment of the ligaments, and at the surface touching the gall-bladder. The fibrous covering is very thin, but it is rather stronger where the peritoneum is not in contact with it. It invests the liver, and is continuous at the transverse fissure with the fibrous sheath (capsule of Glisson) surrounding the vessels in the interior. When the membrane is torn from the surface, it will be found connected with fine shreds entering into the liver. Size and form of the lobules. The lobules (fig. 160, I) constitute the proper secreting substance, and can be seen either on the exterior of the liver, on a cut surface, or by means of a rent in the mass. As thus observed, these bodies are about the size of a pin's head, and measure from -Jo^h. to -j^th of an inch in diameter. Closely massed together, they possess a dark central point; and there are indications of lines of separation between them, though they are to some extent united together. By means of transverse and vertical sections of the lobules, their form will appear flattened on the exterior, but many-sided in the interior of the liver. They are clustered around the smallest divisions of the hepatic vein, to which each is connected by a small twig issuing from the centre, something like the union of the stalk with the body of a small fruit. Vessels of the liver. Two sets of blood-vessels ramify in the liver :—One enters the transverse fissure, and the branches are directed transversely in spaces (portal canals) where they are enveloped by areolar tissue. The other set (hepatic veins) run from the anterior to the posterior border of the liver without a sheath. The ramifications of these different vessels are to be followed in the liver. The capsule of Glisson is a layer of areolar tissue, which envelops the vessels and the ducts in the transverse fissure, and is continued on their branches in the portal canals. In this sheath the vessels ramify, and become minutely divided before their termination in the lobules. If a transverse section is made of a portal canal, the vessels will retract somewhat into the loose surrounding tissue. The portal vein ramifies in the liver like an artery ; and the blood circulates through it in the same manner, viz., from trunk to branches. After entering the transverse fissure the vein divides into large branches ; these lie in the portal canals or spaces, with offsets of the hepatic artery, the hepatic duct, and the nerves and lymphatics (fig. 160, p). The division is repeated again and again, until the last branches of the vein {interlobular) penetrate between the lobules, where they communicate together, and supply the hepatic substance. In the portal canals the offsets of the vena portae are joined by small vaginal and capsular veins, which convey blood from branches of the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery (fig. 160, c), while surrounded by the capsule,511 OBVIOUS STRUCTURE OF LIVER. sheath, begin in the lobules, furnishes vaginal branches, which ramify in the sheath, giving it a red appearance in a well-injected liver, and supply twigs to the andcapsule coats of the portal vein and biliary ducts, and to the areolar tissue : from the vaginal branches a few offsets (capsular) are given to the ending in coat of the °liver. Finally, the artery ends in fine interlobular lobu es> branches, from which offsets enter the lobules. The hepatic veins (venae cavse hepaticse) begin by small intralobular ^f^ith- veins from the centre of the lobules ; these are received into the sub- 0ut a lobular branches, which anas- tomose together, and unite into Fig. 160 larger vessels. Finally, uniting with neighbouring branches to produce larger trunks, the hepatic veins are directed from before backwards to the vena cava inferior, into which they open by large orifices. The hepatic veins may be said to be without a sheath, except in the larger trunks ; so that when they are cut across the ends remain patent, in consequence of their close connection with the hver structure.

Structure. The moderately-sized hepatic ducts consist of a fibrous structure coat, lined by a mucous layer; and penetrating the wall is a longi- s^6*™^" tudinal row of openings, on each side, leading into sacs, and into branched tubes which sometimes communicate. Lymphatics of the liver are superficial and deep. The superficial kympna- of the upper surface in part join the lymphatics of the thorax by superficial, piercing the diaphragm, and enter the anterior mediastinal glands ; those of the under surface mainly join the deep lymphatics issuing at the portal fissure.

Duct of gr 11- bladder; The gall-bladder (fig. 158, gb) is the receptacle of the bile. It is situate in a depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and to the right of the quadrate lobe. It is pear-shaped, and its larger end (fundus) is directed forwards beyond the margin of the liver; while the smaller end {neck) is turned in the opposite direction, and bends downwards to terminate in the cystic duct by a zigzag part. In length the gall-bladder measures three or four inches, and in breadth rather more than an inch at the widest part. It holds from an ounce to an ounce and a half. By one surface it is in contact with the liver, and on the opposite it is covered by peritoneum. The larger end touches the abdominal wall opposite the. cartilage of the ninth rib (fig. 144, gb), where it is con- tiguous to the transverse colon ; and the small end is in contact with the duodenum. Structure. The gall-bladder possesses a peri- toneal, a fibrous and muscular, and a mucous- coat. The serous coat is stretched over the under or free surface of the gall-bladder, and surrounds the large end. The fibrous coat is strong, and forms the framework of the sac ; intermixed with it are some involuntary muscular fibres, the chief being longitudinal, but others circular. The mucous coat is marked internally by numerous ridges and intervening depressions, which give an alveolar or honeycomb appear- ance to the surface. On laying open the gall- bladder this condition will be seen, with the aid of a lens, to be most developed about the centre of the sac, and to diminish towards each ex- tremity. In the bottom of the larger pits are depressions leading to recesses. Where the gall-bladder ends in the cystic duct (fig. 161) its coats project into the interior, and give rise to ridges resembling those in the sacculated large intestine.

The coats of the duct are formed like those of the sac ^^ac. from which it leads, but the muscular fibres are very few. The and is pro- mucous lining is provided with glands, as in the hepatic and common ^^swlth bile-ducts. On opening the duct the mucous membrane may be observed to Mucous coat form about twelve semilunar projections (fig. 161, c), which are llke a screw- arranged obliquely around the tube, and increase in size towards the gall-bladder. This structure is best seen on a gall-bladder which has been inflated and dried, as in this state the parts of the duct between the ridges are most stretched. Blood-vessels and nerves. The vessels of the gall-bladder are named Artery and cystic. The artery is a branch of the hepatic ; and the cystic vein vein ' opens into the right branch of the vena portae. The nerves are nerves and derived from the hepatic plexus, and entwine around the vessels. The lymphatics follow the cystic duct, and join the lymphatics on lymphatics, the under surface of the liver. THE KIDNEY AND THE URETER. The kidney has a characteristic form, resembling an oval with Kidney: one side (the inner) somewhat hollowed out, and being compressed form; from before backwards. For the purpose of distinguishing between to distin- the right and left kidneys, let the excavated margin be turned ^"^[g^f11 inwards, with the ureter or the excretory tube behind the other vessels ; and let that end of the viscus be directed downwards, towards which the ureter is naturally inclined. With the special form above mentioned, the kidney is of a deep Colour; red colour, and has an even surface. Its average length is about four size; inches ; its breadth two and a half inches ; and its thickness rather more than one inch ; but the left is commonly longer and more slender than the right kidney. Its usual weight is about four ounces and weight, and a half in the male, and rather less in the female. The left kidney is slightly heavier than the right. The upper extremity of the kidney is broader than the lower, and Extrcmi- is surmounted by the suprarenal body. The lower end is moret,es; pointed. The position with respect to the spinal column has been before detailed (p. 472). On the anterior surface the viscus is rounded, but on the opposite surfaces; surface it is more flattened. The outer border is convex ; but the inner is excavated, and is borders, marked by a longitudinal fissure—the hilum. In the fissure the Contents of vessels are thus placed with respect to one another :—The divisions t,,e.ll88Ure" of the renal vein are in front, the ureter is behind, and the branches ^s^on. of the artery lie between the two. On the vessels the nerves and Lymphatics ramify ; and areolar tissue and fat surround the whole. The fissure leads into a hollow named the sinus, in which the vessels sinus, and the duct are contained before they pierce the renal substance. L L514 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

To see the interior it will be necessary to cut through the kidney from the inner to the outer border, and to remove the loose tissue from the vessels, and from the divisions of the excretory duct. The sinus containing the blood-vessels now comes completely into view. The interior of the kidney (fig. 162) is seen on a section to consist of an external granular or cortical portion, and of internal, darker coloured, pyramidal masses, which converge towards the centre. The pyramidal masses (pyramids Fig. 162.* °^ Malpighi; d) are from eight to eighteen in number, but generally more than twelve. The apex of each mass, which is free from cor- tical covering, is directed to the sinus, and ends in a smooth, rounded part, named mamilla or papilla («). In it are the openings of the urine tubes, which are about twenty in number, some being situate in a central depression, and others on the surface ; and it is surrounded by one of the divisions (calyx) of the excretory tube. Oc- casionally two of the masses are united in one papillary termination. The base is embedded in the cor- tical substance, and from it slender processes are continued into the cortical covering. The cut surface of the pyramid has a striated appearance, owing to the arrangement of the uriniferous tubules composing it, and the blood-vessels. If the mass is compressed in a fresh kidney, urine will exude from the tubes through the apertures in the apex. The cortical part (tig. 162, e) forms about three-fourths of the kidney ; it covers the pyramidal masses with a layer about two lines in thickness, and sends prolongations between them nearly to their apices. Its colour is of a light red, unless the kidney is blanched ; and its consistence is so slight that the mass gives way beneath the finger. In the injected kidney red points (Malpighian bodies) are scattered through the cortex, giving it a granular appearance. The kidney has a fibrous tunic or capsule, which is connected to the glandular substance by fine processes and vessels, and is readily detached from it by slight force. At the inner margin of the kidney it sinks into the sinus, where it sends processes on the enter- ing vessels, and becomes continuous with the outer coat of the excretory duct. * Section through a piece of the kidney, showing the medullary and cortical portions, and the beginning of the ureter (Heule). a.

Before reaching the kidney the renal artery divides Branching into four or five pieces ; and these in the sinus break up into j^«renal smaller branches, which enter the organ between the papillse. They run in the processes of cortical substance that separate the pyramids, being surrounded by sheaths from the fibrous capsule, and undergoing farther subdivision, until they reach the bases of the pyramids. Here the branches form arches, from which the minute offsets to the secreting structures are given off. Some twigs are supplied to the capsule of the kidney ; and these anastomose with the subperitoneal branches of the lumbar arteries. Renal vein.

Between its origin and termination office; the canal measures from fourteen to sixteen inches in length. Its length; size corresponds commonly with that of a large quill. Near the size varies, kidney it is dilated into a funnel-shaped part, named pelvis; and near the bladder it is again somewhat enlarged, though the lower aperture by which it terminates is the narrowest part of the tube. Its relative anatomy must be studied afterwards, when the body is in a suitable position. In its course from the one viscus to the other, the ureter is close Course beneath the peritoneum, and is directed obliquely downwards and inwards along the posterior wall of the abdomen to the pelvis. At first the ureter is placed over the psoas, inclining on the right side and rela- towards the inferior vena cava ; and about the middle of the muscle tlons' it is crossed by the spermatic vessels. Lower clown it lies over the common or the external iliac artery, being beneath the sigmoid flexure on the left side, and the end of the ileum on the right side. Lastly, it inclines forwards below the level of the obliterated hypo- gastric artery to reach the base of the bladder (p. 549). Sometimes the ureter is divided into two for a certain distance. d°u'bc1tl!nics ■ Part in the kidney (fig. 162, 6). Near the kidney the ureter is rjMter' dilated into a funnel-shaped part called the pelvis. It begins in the Elated new- kidney by a set of cup-shaped tubes, named calices or infundibula, k^."ey: which vary in number from seven to thirteen. Each cup-shaped M' process embraces the rounded end of a pyramidal mass, and receives embrace the urine from the apertures in that projection : sometimes a calyx wiUai- surrounds two or more masses. The several calices are united together to form two or three larger tubes ; and these are finally blended in the pelvis. L L 2516 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Three coats to ureter: fibrous, muscular, and mucous Structure. The chief part of the wall of the ureter is composed of a muscular coat, in which there is an outer layer of circular, and an inner layer of longitudinal fibres (Henle). This has an external investment of fibrous tissue, and is lined by mucous membrane. The calices resemble the rest of the duct in having a fibrous, a muscular, and a mucous coat. Around the base of the papilla the outer coat of the calyx is continuous with the enveloping tunic of the kidney; and at the apex the mucous lining is prolonged into the uriniferous tubes through the small openings. Vessels. The arteries are numerous but small, and are furnished by the renal, spermatic, internal iliac, and inferior vesical. The veins correspond with the arteries.

This small body, the use of which is unknown, has received its name from its position to the kidney. Its vessels and nerves are numerous, but it is not provided with any excretory duct. One on each side, it is situate on the upper end of the kidney, with an inclination to the inner side ; and without care it may be removed with the surrounding fat, which it resembles. Its colour is a brownish yellow. It is rather triangular in shape, and flattened from before back, but with the upper angle rounded off, and the base or lower part hollowed, where it touches the kidney. On the anterior surface is a transverse fissue, termed the hilum, where the vein issues. In the adult it measures about one inch and a half in depth, and rather less in width ; and its weight is between one and two drachms, but the left is commonly larger than the right. Areolar tissue attaches the suprarenal body to the kidney ; and the vessels and nerves retain it in place. The relations to surround- ing parts are the same as those of the upper end of the kidney. Thus, it rests on the diaphragm on both sides ; while in front of the right, is the liver, and in front of the left the pancreas and the stomach. On the inner side of the right capsule are the vena cava and the solar plexus ; and internal to the left are the aorta, with the cceliac axis, and the solar plexus. Obvimis structure. A vertical section of a fresh suprarenal body shows it to be formed of an external or cortical layer, and an internal or medullary substance. The whole is surroimded by a thin fibrous capsule, which sends processes into the interior, and along the blood-vessels. The cortical part is of a deep yellow colour, and firm. It forms about two-thirds of the thickness of the whole body, and in the section appears striated perpendicularly to the free surface of the organ. The medullary part is dark brown or nearly black, and very soft and pulpy. If the specimen is not fresh, it may look as if the cortical part enclosed a cavity.517 ANATOMY OF THE TESTICLE. Blood-vessels. Numerous arteries are furnished to the suprarenal Arteries, body from the aorta and from the diaphragmatic and renal arteries. Their small branches penetrate the organ at many spots of its cir- cumference. The veins are for the most part collected into one veins, large trunk, which issues by the hiluni, and opens on the right side into the vena cava, on the left into the renal vein. Other smaller veins pass out through the cortex to the renal vein and the vena cava. Nerves. The nerves are very numerous and large, and come from Nerves, the solar plexus. Lymphatics are superficial and deep ; and both join those of the Lymplia- kidney. THE TESTICLE. The testicles (testes) are the glandular organs for the secretion of Testes the semen. Each is suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cord l^tuii"1 and its coverings (p. 451), but the left is usually lower than the right; and each is provided with an excretory duct named vas deferens. A serous sac partly surrounds each organ. Dissection. For the purpose of examining the serous covering of To see the the testicle (tunica vaginalis), make a small aperture into it at the iieious sac- upper part, and innate it. The sac and the spermatic cord are then to be cleaned; and the vessels of the latter are to be followed to their entrance into the testicle. The tunica vaginalis (fig. 163, d) is a serous bag, which is con- Tunica tinuous in the foetus with the peritoneal lining of the abdomen, but vasmal,:f becomes subsequently a distinct sac through the obliteration of the part connecting the two (p. 451). It invests the testicle after the manner of other serous membranes ; partly for the testicle is placed behind it, so as to be partly enveloped by £°svtfjciethe it. The sac, however, is larger than is necessary for covering the and lines testicle, and projects some distance above it. Like other serous scrotum: membranes, it has an external rough, and an internal smooth sur- face ; and like them it has a visceral and a parietal part. To examine its disposition, the sac should be opened. The visceral layer (tunica vaginalis testis) covers the testicle, except visceral posteriorly where the vessels lie. On the outer side it extends Part> farther back than on the inner, and invests the greater part of the epididymis, forming a pouch (digital fossa) between that body and the testicle. The parietal part of the sac (tunica vaginalis scroti) is more and parietal, extensive than the piece covering the testicle, and lines the con- tiguous layer of the scrotum. Form and position of the testis (fig. 163). The testicle is oval in Testicle shape, with a smooth surface, and is somewhat compressed from side nval; to side. The anterior margin is convex and free ; the posterior, margins, which is flattened, is pierced by the spermatic vessels and nerves.

The testis is suspended obliquely, so that the upper part is directed forwards and somewhat outwards, and the lower end backwards and rather inwards. Size and weight. The length of the testis is an inch and a half or two inches; from before backwards it measures rather more than an inch, and from side to side rather less than an inch. Its weight is nearly an ounce, and the left is fre- quently larger than the other. Structure. The substance of the tes- ticle is composed of minute secerning tubes, around which the Wood-vessels are disposed in plexuses. Surrounding and supporting the delicate seminiferal tubes is a dense covering—the tunica albugineu. Its excretory or efferent duct is named vas deferens. Dissection. With the view of examining the investing fibrous coat, let the testis be placed on its outer side, viz., that on which the epididymis lies, and let it be fixed firmly in that position with pins. The fibrous coat is to be cut through along the anterior part, and thrown back- wards as far as the entrance of the blood-vessels. While raising this mem- brane a number of fine bands will be seen traversing the substance of the tes- ticle, and a short septal piece (medias- tinum) may be perceived at the back of the viscus, where the vessels enter; but it will be expedient to remove part of the mass of tubes in the interior, to bring more fully into view the medi- astinum, and to trace back some of the finer septa to it. The tunica albuginea, or the fibrous coat of the testicle, is of a bluish-white colour, and resembles in appearance the sclerotic coat of the eyeball. This membrane protects the secreting part of the testicle, and maintains the shape of the organ by its dense and un- yielding structure: it also sends inwards processes to support and separate the seminal tubes. These several offsets of the membrane appear in the dissection ; and one of them at the back of the testicle,, which is larger than the rest, is the mediastinum. * The testis, with the tunica vaginalis laid open. a.

The mediastinum testis (corpus Highmorianum ; fig. 164, r) pro- J**6^ jects into the gland for a third of an inch with the blood-vessels. It is situate at the back of the testis, extending from the upper nearly to the lower end, and is rather larger and deeper above than below. It is formed of two pieces, which are united in front at an acute angle. To its front and sides the finer septal processes are connected ; and in its interior are contained the blood-vessels behind, and a network of seminal ducts (rete testis) in front. Of the finer processes of the tunica albuginea (fig. 164, b) which *^rM t&. enter the testis, there are two kinds. One set, round and cord-like, 11 but of different lengths, is attached posteriorly to the mediastinum, and serves to maintain the shape of the testis. The other set forms delicate membranous septa, which divide the mass of seminal tubes into lobes, and join the mediastinum, bike the rest. Within the tunica albudnea is a thin vascular layer, the tunica vas- a vascular ° . layer lines cidosa, which lines the fibrous coat, and covers the different septa it (tunica in the interior of the gland. It is formed of the ramifications vasculosil)- of the blood-vessels, united by areolar tissue, like the pia mater of the brain : in it the arteries are subdivided before they are distributed on the secerning tubes, and the small veins are collected into larger trunks. Form and length, of the seminal tubes (tubuli seminiferi). The Seminal secerning or seminal tubes are very convoluted, and are but slightly tumiIcs: held together by fine areolar tissue and surrounding blood-vessels, ^earance so that they may be readily drawn out of the testis for some dis- tance : their length is said by Lauth to be two feet and a quarter, length ; Ending, size and structure. Within the lobes of the testis some comnmni- tabes end in distinct closed extremities ; but the rest communicate, catl0ns • forming loops or arches. The diameter of the tubules varies from and size, -igth to T^oth of an inch. The wall of the tubule is formed of a thin translucent membrane, but it has considerable strength. Names from the arrangement of the tubes. To different parts of the Tubes seminal tubes, the following names have been applied. Where the their tubules are collected into masses, they form the lobes of the testis. As they enter the fibrous mediastinum they become straight, and are named tubuli recti. Communicating in the mediastinum, they produce the rete testis. And, lastly, as they leave the upper end of the gland they are convoluted, and are called coni vasculosi, or vasa efferentia. The lobes of the testis (fig. 164, a) are formed by bundles of the They form seminiferous tubes, and are situate in the intervals between the the lobes: processes of the tunica albuginea. From 100 to 200 in number number; (Krause), they are conical in fonn, with the base of each at the shape; circumference, and the apex at the mediastinum testis; and those in the centre of the testicle are the largest. Each is made up of two or more tortuous seminal tubules ; and tubes to the minute tubes in one lobe are united with those in the neighbour- ^S'^ mg lobes. Towards the apex of each lobe the tubules become less ment. bunt, and are united together ; and the tubuli of the several lobes are farther joined at the same spot into the tubuli recti.520 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

Epididymis consisting of head, tail, and body; how fixed ; formed of a coiled tube Tubuli recti (fig. 164, c). The seminal tubes uniting together become narrower and straighter in direction, and are named tubuli recti or vasa recta : they pierce the fibrous mediastinum and enter the rete testis. Rete testis (fig. 164, e). In the mediastinum the seminal tubes have no proper walls (beyond epithelium), and are situate in tin anterior part, in front of the blood-vessels ; they communicate freely so as to form a network. Vasa efferentia (fig. 164,/). From twelve to twenty tubes leave the top of the rete, and issue Fig. 164.* from the upper end of the testicle as the vasa efferentia : these are larger than the tubes with which they are continuous, and end in the canal of the epididymis (part of the common excretory duct). Though straight at first, they soon become con- voluted, and have been named coni vasculosi. In the natural state they are about half an inch in length, but when unravelled they mea- sure six inches; and they join the excretory duct at intervals of about three inches. The excretory duct receives the vasa efferentia from the upper part of the gland, and extends thence to the urethra. Its first part, which is in contact with the testis, is very flexuous, and forms the epididymis ; but the remainder is comparatively straight, and is named vas deferens. The epididymis (fig. 164, h) extends in the form of an arch along the outer side of the testis, from the upper to the lower end. and receives its name from its situation. Opposite the upper part of the testicle it presents an enlarged portion or head, the globus major (g) ; and at the lower end of that organ it becomes more pointed or tail-like—globus minor (i), before ending in the vas deferens. The intervening narrow part of the epididymis is called the body (h). It is attached to the testis, most closely at the ends, by fibrous tissue and by the reflection of' the tunica vaginalis, the globus major also by the vasa efferentia. The epididymis is formed of a single tube, bent in a zigzag way, the coils of which are united into a solid mass by fibrous tissue. * Vertical and horizontal sections of the testis, to show the arrangement of the septa and seminal tubes, a.

After the removal of the serous membrane and some fibrous tissue this part of the tube may be uncoiled ; it will then measure twenty length and feet or more in length. The diameter of its canal is about -^tb. of auo- an inch, though there is a slight diminution in size towards the "lobus minor; but it increases again as it approaches the vas deferens. The vas deferens (fig. 164, k) begins opposite the lower end of Vasdefc. the testis, at the termination of the globus minor of the epididymis, reus: At first the excretory duct is slightly wavy, but afterwards it becomes for the most part a firm, round, and direct tube ; near its termination it is enlarged again and sacculated, but this condition will be referred to with the viscera of the pelvis. In its course to the urethra it ascends over the hinder part of the oom.se to testicle, on the inner side of the epididymis, and then along the urethra; blood-vessels of the spermatic cord, with which it enters the internal abdominal ring; here it bends downwards round the epigastric artery (p. 452), and is then continued over the bladder (p. 550), and through the prostate to open into the urethra. The length of lenetn antl this part of the excretory duct is about two feet, and the width of size! its canal about ^th of an inch. . Opening into the vas deferens, at the angle of union with the v abeiTails epididymis, there is frequently a small, narrow, CBeeal appendage, the frequently vas aberrans of Haller (fig. 164, I). It is convoluted, and projects g^^";*,, upwards for one or two inches amongst the vessels of the cord. Like the epididymis, it is longer when it Is uncoiled. Its capacity an(1 aize is greatest at the free end. Structure.

To see the diaphragm. Deli ne arches. Diaphragm situation and form; origin at the circum- ference ; insertion of fibres into a central tendon. Directions. After the body is replaced in its former position on the back, the student should prepare first the diaphragm, next the large vessels and their branches, and then the deep muscles of the abdomen. Dissection. For the dissection of the diaphragm it will be necessary to remove the peritoneum, denning especially the central tendinous part, and the strong processes or pillars which are fixed to the lumbar vertebra?. While cleaning the muscle the student should be careful of the vessels and nerves on the surface, and of others in and near the pillars. On the right side two aponeurotic bands or arches near the spine, which give attachment to the muscular fibres, should be dissected ; one curves over the internal muscle (psoas) ; the other extends over the external muscle (quadratus), and will be made more evident by separating it from the fascia covering the quadratus. The diaphragm or midriff (fig. 165, a) forms the vaulted moveable partition between the thorax and the abdomen. It is fleshy externally, where it is attached to the surrounding ribs and the spinal column, and tendinous in the centre. The origin of the muscle is at the circumference, and is similar on each side of the middle line. Thus, it arises by fleshy slips from the inner surface of the ensiform process and the six lower rib- cartilages ; from two aponeurotic arches between the last rib and the spinal column,—one being placed over the quadratus lumbornm. and the other over the psoas muscle ; and, lastly, from the lumbar vertebra? by a thick muscular piece or pillar. From this extensive origin the fibres are directed inwards, with different degrees of obliquity and length, to the central tendon ; but some have a peculiar disposition in the pillars which will be afterwards noted (p. 524).THE DIAPHRAGM. 523 The abdominal surface is concave, and is covered for the most parts in part by the peritoneum. In contact with it on the right side are the^ndw the liver and the kidney ; and on the opposite side, the stomach, surface, the spleen, and the left kidney : in contact also with the pillars are the pancreas and the solar plexus with the semilunar ganglia.

The central tendon (cordifonn tendon) occupies the middle of the diaphragm (fig. 165), and is surrounded by muscular fibres : tin: large vena cava pierces it. It is of a pearly white colour, and its tendinous fibres cross in different directions. Inform it is com- pared to a trefoil leaf ; of its three lobes or segments the right (c) is the largest, and the left (a) the smallest. The pillars (crura) are two large muscular and tendinous pro- cesses (d and e), one on each side of the abdominal aorta. They are narrow and tendinous below, where they are attached to the ujjper lumbar vertebrae, but large and fleshy above; and between them is a tendinous arch over the aorta. In each pillar the fleshy fibres pass upwards and forwards, diverg- ing from each other ; the greater number join the central tendon without intermixing, but the inner fibres of the two crura cross one another in the following manner :—Those of the right (e) ascend by the side of the aorta, and pass to the left of the middle line, decussating with the fibres of the opposite cms between that vessel and the opening of the oesophagus. The fibres of the other cms (d) may be traced in the same way, to form the right half of the oeso- phageal opening. In the decussation the fasciculus of fibres from the right crus is generally larger than, and in front of, that from the left. The pillars differ somewhat on opposite sides. The light (e) is the larger of the two, and is fixed by tendinous processes to the bodies of the first three lumbar vertebras, and' their intervertebral substances, reaching to the disc between the third and fourth verte- brae. The left pillar (d) is situate more on the side of the spine, is partly concealed by the aorta, and does not reach so far as the right by the depth of a vertebra : it is occasionally wanting. The arches (ligamenta arcuata) are two fibrous bands on each side over the quadratus lumborutn and psoas muscles, which give origin to fleshy fibres. The arch over the psoas (Kg. arcuat. internum ; /) is the stronger, and is connected by the one end to the tendinous part of the pillar of the diaphragm, and by the other to the transverse process of the first or second lumbar vertebra. The arch over the quadratus lumborum (lig. arcuat. externum ; g) is only a thickened piece of the fascia covering that muscle, and extends from the same transverse process to the last rib. Apertures. There are three large openings for the aorta, the vena cava, and the oesophagus ; with some smaller fissures for nerves and vessels. The opening for the aorta (k) is rather behind than in the dia- phragm, for it is situate between the pillars of the muscle and the spinal column : it transmits the aorta, the thoracic duct, and the large azygos vein. The opening for the oesophagus and the pneumo-gastric nerves (i) is above and slightly to the left of the aortic aperture ; it is placed in the muscular part of the diaphragm, and is bounded by the fibres of the pillars as above explained.525 ACTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM.

There is a fissure (j) in each pillar for the three splanchnic Fissures m nerves; and through that in the left cms the small azygos vein also passes. Action of the diaphragm. By the contraction of the muscular fibres Use in the tendon is moved doAvnwards, and the arch of the diaphragm is iesI"ra 1011 lessened in inspiration; and during their relaxation, the centre of the muscle is elevated, and the height of the vaidt increased in ex- piration, owing to the elasticity of the lungs, and the pressure of the viscera below, which are forced upwards by the action of the abdominal muscles (p. 442). In the descent of the diaphragm, the parts of the tendon move Central part unequally, in consequence of differences in their relations, and in m°gj.e.s the length of the fleshy fibres connected with them. Thus, the central lobe, above which the heart is placed, moves least; while the lateral lobes, which are below the lungs, descend more freely, left part the right, however, less than the left, owing to the presence of the ™°g'age liver. It is estimated that the central lobe of the tendon moves descent in downwards in full inspiration about two-fifths of an inch, the right tion.inSP lobe twice as much, and the left lobe one inch (Hasse). In forced ^jsjj*in expiration the muscle reaches as high as the fourth rib on the right expiration, side, and the fifth on the left, close to the sternum. With the movement of the diaphragm the size of the cavities of Effect on the abdomen and thorax will be altered. By its descent the thorax abdomen"1 is enlarged, and the abdomen diminished ; and the viscera in the on viscera, upper part of the latter cavity, viz., liver, stomach, and spleen, are partly moved from beneath the ribs. By its ascent the cavity of the thorax is lessened, and that of the abdomen is restored to its former size ; and the displaced viscera return to their usual place. By the contraction of the fibres the aperture for the oesophagus will and on be rendered smaller, and that tube may be compressed ; but the aPertures- other openings for the vena cava and aorta are not materially changed. The action of the diaphragm is commonly involuntary, but it is Action in- perfectly under the control of the will. voluntary. Dissection. After the diaphragm has been learnt, the ribs that Take away support it on each side may be cut through, and the loose pieces of ^the'part bone with the fore part of the diaphragm may be taken away, to diaphragm, facilitate the dissection of the deeper vessels and muscles. But the posterior third of the diaphragm, with its pillars and arches, should be left ; and the vessels ramifying on it should be followed back to their origin. The large vessels of the abdomen, viz., the aorta and the vena Clean aortn cava, are to be cleaned by removing the fat, the remains of the branches1; sympathetic plexuses, and the lymphatic glands ; and their branches are to be followed to the diaphragm, to the kidney and suprarenal body, and to the testicle. In like manner the large iliac branches also iliac of the aorta and cava are to be laid bare as far as Poupart's ligament. vcsseLs-526 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. The ureter and the spermatic vessels are to be cleaned as they cross the iliac artery ; and on the same vessel, near the thigh, branches of a small nerve (genito-crural) are to be sought.

The muscles are to be laid bare on the right side, but on the left D'™^ side the fascia covering them is to be shown ; and the fat is to be inusc ' cleared away from the kidney. The psoas muscle, the most internal, lies on the side of the spine, psoas and with the small psoas (if present) superficial to it. On its surface, ^rnv^rof and in the fat external to it, the following branches of the lumbar plexus, plexus will be found :—The genito-crural nerve lies on the front. Four other nerves issue at the outer border,—the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal near the top, the external cutaneous about the centre, and the large anterior crural at the lower part. Along the inner border of the psoas the gangliated cord of the sympathetic is to be sought, with a chain of lumbar lymphatic glands ; and lower down the obturator nerve may be recognised entering the cavity of the pelvis. External to the psoas is the quadratus lumborum, ^k™uiii and crossing the latter near the last rib is the last dorsal nerve, with an artery. In the hollow of the hip-bone is the iliacus muscle, and iliacus. which unites below with the large psoas. The abdominal AORTA (fig. 166, b) extends from the lower part of the last dorsal vertebra to about the middle of the body of the aorta, fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the common iliac arteries. Its commencement is between the pillars of the diaphragm, and its termination is placed opposite a spot below and slightly to the left of the umbilicus, and nearly on a level with the highest point of the iliac crest. The chief relations of the vessel to surrounding parts have been Relations before referred to (p. 484), but some deep vessels in connection with it now come into view. As the aorta rests on the spine it lies on the left lumbar veins, which end in the inferior cava. And vessels501' between it and the right cms of the diaphragm are the large azygos vein and the thoracic duct. Along the sides of the vessel are the lumbar lymphatic glands, from which large vessels run beneath it to end in the beginning of the thoracic duct. The branches of the aorta are numerous, and arise in the following p'ace of order :—First, are the diaphragmatic arteries, two in number, which Sehcs; leave the front of the vessel immediately it appears in the abdomen. Close to the tendinous ring of the diaphragm, the single trunk of the cceliac axis arises from the front; and about a quarter of an inch lower down, also on the front, the trunk of the superior mesenteric artery begins. Half an inch lower, the renal arteries, right and left, take origin from the sides of the aorta. On the lateral part of the vessel, close above each renal, is the small capsu- lar branch; and below the renal is the slender spermatic artery. From the front of the arterial trunk, one or two inches above the bifurcation, springs the inferior mesenteric artery. And from the back of the vessel arise five lumbar arteries on each side, and the middle sacral close above the bifurcation. The branches may be classified into two sets,—one to the viscera clnssi- of the abdomen (visceral), and another to the abdominal wall fication (parietal). The visceral branches are cceliac axis, superior and inferior mesen- Some visceral branches.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN'. 528 Renal arterv is beneath its vein; gives off- sets ; difference lietween left and right.

Inferior phrenic: course of left and right; distribu- tion ; small offsets. Other arteries to diaphragm. teric, renal, capsular, and spermatic. Of these, the first three have already been examined. The renal arteries (fig. 166, c) leave the aorta nearly at a right angle, and are directed outwards, one on each side. Near the kidney each divides into four or five branches, which enter the hilum of the organ between the vein and the ureter. Each artery lies beneath its companion vein, being surrounded by a plexus of nerves,, and supplies small twigs to the suprarenal body {inferior capsular), to the ureter, and to the fatty layer about the kidney. The arteries of opposite sides have some differences. The left is the shorter, owing to the position of the aorta : the right crosses the spine, and passes beneath the vena cava. The middle capsular or suprarenal artery is a small branch which runs almost transversely outwards to the suprarenal body : this offset anastomoses with the other branches to the suprarenal body from the renal and diaphragmatic arteries. It is of large size in the foetus. The spermatic artery of the testicle (fig. 166, d) is remarkable for its small size in proportion to its length ; for leaving the cavity of the abdomen ; and for having the part in the abdomen straight, but that in the cord tortuous. From its origin below the renal, the vessel passes downwards along the posterior wall of the abdomen to the internal abdominal ring, where it enters the spermatic cord (p. 452). In its course beneath the peritoneum the vessel runs along the front of the psoas, crossing over the ureter; and on the right side it passes over the vena cava. It is accompanied by the spermatic vein, and the sper- matic plexus of nerves. In the foetus before the testicle leaves the abdomen the spermatic artery is very short, but the vessel elongates as the testis is removed from its original position. In the female the corresponding artery {ovarian) descends into- the pelvis to end in the ovary and the uterus. The parietal branches of the aorta are the diaphragmatic, lumbar, and middle sacral. The diaphragmatic arteries (inferior phrenic ; fig. 166, a) are frequently united together at their origin, or with the cceliae axis. They course upwards along the posterior part of the under surface of the diaphragm, the left artery passing behind the oesophageal opening, and the right behind the vena cava. Each ends in two branches :—One (internal) passes onwards towards the front of the diaphragm, and anastomoses with its fellow, and with the superior phrenic and musculo-phrenic branches of the internal mammary. The other (external) is larger, and is directed outwards to the side of the muscle, where it communicates with the inter- costal arteries. Branches. Small offsets to the suprarenal body from the external- division of this artery are named superior capsular. Some twigs are given by the left artery to the oesophagus, and by the right to the vena cava. On the under surface of the diaphragm are lwo branches of the529 COMMON AND EXTEENAL ILIAC AETEEIES. imon internal mammary artery (p. 259) ; one, superior phrenic, accom- panies the phrenic nerve, and ramifies over the middle of the muscle; the other, musculophrenic, appears opposite the ninth cartilage, and supplies the upper costal slips of the diaphragm. The other parietal branches, viz., lumbar and middle sacral, are not learnt in this stage : the former will be seen after the lumbar plexus (p. 537), and the latter in the pelvis (p. 561). The common iliac artery (fig. 166, g) is directed downwards Oomi^ and outwards from the bifurcation of the aorta, and divides into iaoareiy two laro-e trunks opposite the fibro-cartilage between the last lumbar extent and vertebra and the sacrum ;—one of these (external iliac) supplies the terminat,on: lower limb, and the other (internal iliac) enters the pelvis. Placed relations; obliquely on the vertebral column, the vessel measures about two inches in length. It is covered by the peritoneum, and is crossed by branches of the sympathetic nerve, and sometimes by the ureter. It is accompanied by a vein of the same name. Usually it does usually no not furnish any named branch, but it may give origin to the ilio- ranc ICS' lumbar, or a renal artery. On opposite sides the vessels have some differences. The right artery has the vena cava to its outer side above, and Differences near its termination touches the psoas muscle. The companion vein rjght (p) is at first beneath, but becomes external to the artery at the upper part ; and beneath the right artery also is the left common iliac vein. The left artery is crossed by the superior hsemorrhoidal and left vessels ; and its companion vein is situate to its inner side. It lies close to the psoas muscle throughout. The length of the common iliac artery ranges from less than half an inch to Variations four inches and a half ; but in the majority of instances it varies between one in length, inch and a half and three inches (R. Quain). The EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY (fig. 166, h) is the first part of the External vessel leading to the lower limb, and is contained in the cavity of jo^eJ^mi,1? the abdomen. Its extent is from the bifurcation of the common extent and iliac to the lower border of Poupart's ligament, where it becomes tUrectlon; femoral. And its direction would be indicated, on the surface of the abdomen, by a line from'the left of the umbilicus to the middle of the space between the symphysis pubis and the front of the iliac crest. The vessel lies above the brim of the pelvis in its course to relations Poupart's ligament, and is covered closely by the peritoneum and aroundartS the subperitoneal fat. The right artery is crossed by the lower end of the ileum, and the left by the sigmoid flexure. To its outer side is the psoas, except at its termination under Poupart's ligament, where it lies over the muscle. A chain of lymphatic glands is placed along the front and the inner side of the artery. Near its origin the artery is crossed sometimes by the ureter ; and with other near Poupart's ligament the vas deferens bends down along its inner vessels« side; while the spermatic vessels, and the genital branch of the with nerve, genito-crural nerve lie on it for a short distance. M MDISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 530 and veins. Two named branches: unnamed offsets. The external iliac vein (r) is behind the artery above, but gradually comes forwards and gains its inner side over the pubis. The circumflex iliac vein crosses it nearly an inch above Poupart's ligament. Branches. Two branches, epigastric and circumflex iliac, arise about a quarter of an inch from the end of the artery, and are dis- tributed to the wall of the abdomen (p. 453). Some small unnamed twigs are given to the psoas muscle and the lymphatic glands. < (rigin of branches varies. Occasional brand es from it. Peculiarities in usual branches. The epigastric and circumflex iliac branches may wander over the lower inch and a half or two inches of the artery. In unusual branches.

Vena cava inferior: extent; relations; receives branches from abdo- men, Iliac Veins and Vena Cava (fig. 166). The larger veins of the abdomen correspond so closely with the arteries, both in number, extent, and relations, as to render unnecessary much detail in their description. As the veins increase in size from the circumference towards the centre of the body, those most distant from the heart will be first referred to. The external iliac vein (?•) is a continuation of the femoral vein beneath Poupart's ligament. It has an extent like the artery of the same name, and ends by uniting with the vein from the pelvis (internal iliac), to form the common iliac vein. On the pubis it is internal to its companion artery, and lies between the psoas and pectinens muscles ; but as it ascends it gradually passes behind the artery. The veins opening into it are the epigastric and circumflex iliac (p. 454), and a pubic branch from the obturator vein. The common iliac vein (j>) ascends by the side of its accompany- ing artery, the right almost vertically, and the left obliquely, to the front of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra (the right half), where it blends with its fellow in one trunk—the vena cava. The right vein is the shorter, and lies at first behind, but after- wards outside the artery of the same name. The left is internal to and below the artery of its own side, and crosses beneath the right common iliac arteiy. Each vein receives the ilio-lumbar branch ; and the common iliac of the left side is joined by the middle sacral vein. The inferior or ascending vena cava (m) collects and conveys to the heart the blood of the lower half of the body. Taking origin opposite the fifth lumbar vertebra, lower than the bifurcation of the aorta, this large vein ascends on the right side of the arterial trunk, and reaches the heart by perforating the diaphragm. Its relations to surrounding parts have been already noticed (p. 484), but the description may be again referred to, as the position of the branches of the aorta to it can be better seen now. Branches. The cava receives parietal branches (lumbar and dia- phragmatic) from the Avail of the abdomen and the diaphragm ; and531 BEANCHES OF INFERIOR VENA CAVA. visceral branches from the testicle, the kidney, the snprarenal body, and the liver. Tin- veins belonging to the stomach, the intestinal canal, the except those spleen, and the pancreas, are nnited to form the vena portse apparatus!6 (p. 489); and the blood contained in those vessels reaches the cava by the hepatic veins, after it has circulated through the liver. The spermatic vein (o) enters the abdomen by the internal Spermati; abdominal ring, after forming the spermatic plexus in the cord vcm (p. 521). At first there are two branches in the abdomen, which lie on the sides of the spermatic artery ; but these soon join into one trunk. On the left "side it opens into the renal vein at a right ends differ- angle, and there is generally a small valve over the aperture ; on the j5^.1^1 right side it enters the inferior cava below the renal vein. As the right sides; vein ascends to its destination, it receives one or more branches branches: from the wall of the abdomen, and the fat about the kidney. In the female this vein {ovarian) has the same ending as in the vein in the male, and it forms a plexus in the broad ligament of the uterus. k'"aUK Valves are absent from the vein and its branches, but commonly there is one at its union with the renal. The renal or emulgent vein (n) is of large size, and joins the vena Renal vein; cava at a right angle. It commences by many branches in the position to kidney; and the trunk resulting from their union is superficial toartery; the renal ai-tery.

The psoas magnus (fig. 166, f) reaches from the lumbar vertebra Psoas to the femur, and is situate partly in the abdomen and partly in the nwgnus : thicrh situation ; The muscle arises from the front of the transverse processes of origin froi the lumbar vertebras, from the bodies and intervertebral discs 0f lumbar the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae by five fleshy pieces.— verteblw M M 2532 DISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN.

Psoas parvus: origin; insert ion : [liaeus lias the form of the iliac fossa ; origin; insertion ; parts cover- ing it on two sides; beneath it; each piece being connected with the intervertebral substance and the borders of two contiguous vertebra), and from tendinous bands over the blood-vessels opposite the middle of the vertebra?. 'The fibres give rise to a roundish belly, which gradually diminishes towards Poupart's ligament, and ends below in a tendon on tin- outer aspect, which receives also most of the fibres of the iliacus, and passes beneath Poupart's ligament to be inserted into the small trochanter of the femur. The abdominal part of the muscle has the following relations :— In front are the internal arch of the diaphragm, the kidney with its vessels and duct, the spermatic vessels and the genito-crural nerve, and near Poupart's ligament, the ending of the external iliac artery: beneath these, the muscle is covered by the inner part of the iliac i'ascia. Behind, the muscle is in contact with the transverse processes, with the quadratus lumborum, and with the hip-bone. The outer border touches the quadratus and iliacus ; and branches of the lumbar plexus issue from beneath it. The inner border is partly connected to the vertebra;, and is partly free along the margin of the pelvis ;—along the attached part of this border lies the sympathetic nerve, with the cava on the right, and the. aorta on the left side ; along the free or pelvic part are the external iliac vessels. The nerves of the lumbar plexus lie between the slips of origin from the transverse processes. Action. If the femur is free to move it is raised towards the belly ; and in flexing the hip-joint the psoas is always combined with the iliacus. When the lower limbs are fixed the two muscles will draw forwards the lumbar part of the spine, and bend the hip-joints, as in stooping to the ground. One muscle under the same circumstances can incline the spine laterally. The psoas parvus (fig. 166, e) is a small, inconstant muscle with a long tendon, which is placed on the front of the large psoas. Its fibres arise from the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae, with the intervening fibro-cartilage. Its tendon becomes broader below, and is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and the brim of the pelvis, joining the iliac fascia. Action. This muscle aids in flexing the lumbar portion of the spine, either drawing forwards the upper part of the trunk, or raising the front of the pelvis, according to which end is fixed. The iliacus muscle (fig. 166, h) occupies the iliac fossa on the inner aspect of the hip-bone, and is blended inferiorly with the psoas. It is triangular in form, and has a fleshy origin from the iliac fossa, and slightly from the ala of the sacrum and the anterior sacro-iliac ligament. The fibres pass obliquely inwards to the tendon of the psoas, uniting with it even to its insertion into the femur ; and a few have a separate attachment to the femur below the small trochanter. Above Poupart's ligament the muscle is covered by the iliac fascia ; and over the right iliacus is placed the cajeum, over the left, the sigmoid flexure. Beneath it are the hip-bone and the capsule of theQUADRATUS LUJfBORUM MUSCLE. 533 hip-joint. The inner margin is overlapped by the psoas ; and the anterior crural nerve lies between the two. The relations of the united psoas and iliacus below Poupart's ligament are given with the dissection of the thigh (p. 629). Action. The iliacus raises the femur with the psoas when the ^Jobend limb is moveable, and bends forwards the pelvis when the limb is fixed. The psoas and iliacus may be regarded as two heads of one muscle—the iliopsoas. The quadratus lumborum (fig. 166, g) is a short, flattened ^atus muscle between the pelvis and the last rib. About two inches wide orjgin. below, it arises from the ilio-lumbar ligament, and from the iliac crest behind, and an inch outside that band ; it generally receives in addition two or three slips from the transverse processes of the upper lumbar vertebra;. The fibres ascend to be inserted by insertion; distinct fleshy and tendinous slips into the apices of the transverse processes of the upper four lumbar vertebrae, and into the lower border of the last rib for a variable distance. This muscle is encased in a sheath derived from the fascia is ^"^j^'1. lumborum. Crossing the surface are branches of the lumbar plexus, together with the last dorsal nerve and its vessels. Behind the quadratus is the erector spinas muscle. Action. Both muscles keep straight the spine (one muscle antago- usetf both nising the other) ; and by fixing the last rib they aid in the more "msc es' complete contraction of the diaphragm. One muscle will incline laterally the lumbar region of the spine of one. to the same side, and depress the last rib. Fascia of the quadrahis. Covering the surface of the quadratus is Fascia or the a thin membrane, which is derived from the hinder aponeurosis of qU!Ula 9 1 the transversalis abdominis (fascia lumborum ; p. 386) ; it passes in front of the quadratus to be fixed to the tips and borders of the lumbar transverse processes, to the ilio-lumbar ligament below, and to the last rib above. A thickened band of this fascia forms the external arched ligament, to which the diaphragm is connected (p. 524). Fascia of the iliacus and psoas. A fascia covers the double flexor Ulaofeacia of the hip-joint, and is fixed to the bone on each side of the muscle. ^'j'* ,as. The membrane is strongest opposite the pelvis, where it is attached attachments to the iliac crest on the outer side, and to the brim of the cavity on ,ml"w> the inner side : it receives a strong accession from the tendon of the psoas parvus when that muscle is present, Over the upper part of ami above, the psoas it becomes thin, and is fixed on the one side to the lumbar vertebra? ; while on the other it is blended with the fascia over the quadratus ; and above, it joins the internal arched ligament of the diaphragm. Its disposition at Poupart's ligament, and the part that it takes in the formation of the crural sheath, have been before explained (p. 463). Dissection.

Lumbar lymphatic glands: ducts end in one trunk. Cccliac glands: ducts .join those from intestine. Beginning of the t lin. racic duct. To show the origin of the duct, the diaphragm is to be divided over the aorta, and its pillars are to be thrown to the sides : a piece may be cut out of the aorta opposite the first lumbar vertebra. The beginning of the duct (receptacuhun chyli), and the lower end of the large azygos vein may be well seen : and the two are to be followed upwards into the thorax. On the left side the student may trace the splanchnic nerves and the small azygos vein through the pillar of the diaphragm, and may show the knotted cord of the sympathetic nerve entering the alxlomen beneath the arch over the psoas muscle. Lympltatic glands. A chain of glands is placed along the side of the external iliac artery, and along the front and sides of the Lumbar vertebrae ; they are connected by short tubes, which increase in size and diminish in number, and opposite the first lumbar vertebra form one principal trunk which enters the thoracic duct. Into the glands the lymphatics of the lower limbs, and those of some of the viscera and of the wall of the abdomen are received. Another cluster of large glands surrounds the cceliac axis, and covers the upper end of the abdominal aorta. They are distinguished as the cceliac glands, and receive the lymphatics of the stomach, spleen, pancreas and great part of the liver. Their ducts unite with those of the mesenteric glands, and give rise to one or more large trunks, which pass to the common thoracic duct. Beceptaculum chyli. The thoracic duct begins in the abdomen by the union of three or four large lymphatic trunks. Its commence- ment is marked by a dilatation, which is placed on the right side of the aorta, opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra. The duct enters the thorax by passing through the diaphragm with the aorta. Section VI. SPINAL AND SYMPATHETIC NERVES. Dissection of the lum- bar plexus on left side, with sym- pathetic. The spinal nerves of the loins enter into a plexus, and supply the limb and the contiguous portions of the trunk. Dissection (fig. 167). The lumbar nerves and their plexus are to be learnt on the left side, although the woodcut shows them on the right side ; and to bring them into view, the dissector should cut through the external iliac vessels, and afterwards scrape away the psoas. For the most part the fleshy fibres may be removed freely; but a small branch (accessory of the obturator) should be first looked for at the inner border of the muscle. On, or in the substance of, the quadratus lumborum a communication may be sometimes found between the last dorsal and the first lumbal nerve. The cord of the sympathetic nerve lies along the edge of the psoas, and offsets of it join the spinal nerves ; these are to be followed back along the lumbar arteries.535 LUMBAR PLEXUS. the Four lumbar nerves enter plexus Fig. 167.1 and supply muscles: liftli to the sacral plexus. On the right side the psoas is to be left untouched, in order that the place of emergence from it of the different offsets of the plexus may be noticed. Lumbar Spinal Nerves. The anterior primary branches of lumbar nerves enter the lumbar plexus, with the exception of the last. Five in number, they increase in size from above down, and are joined by filaments of the sympathetic near the intervertebral fora- mina. Before entering the plexus, they supply branches to the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The fifth nerve (fig. 173) receives a commu- nicating branch from the fourth, and is to be fol- lowed into the pelvis to its junction with the sacral plexus. After the two are united, the name lumbosacral cord is ap- plied to the common trunk. The LUMBAR PLEXUS (fig. 167) is formed by the intercommunication of the first four lumbar nerves. Contained in the substance of the psoas, near the posterior surface, it consists of communicating loops be- tween the several nerves, and increases in size from above downwards, like the individual nerves. Superiorly it is sometimes muted by a small branch with the last dorsal nerve ; and infenorly it joins the sacral plexus through the large lumbo- sacral cord. The branches of the plexus are six in number, and supply the Six lower part of the abdominal wall and the muscular covering of the '5?'_°s' Plexus bow formed; situation ; connections witll nerves.

The first two branches (ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal) end as cutaneous nerves of the buttock, the lower part of the abdomen, and the scrotum. a. The ilio-hypogastric branch (fig. 167,/) is derived from the first nerve, and appears at the outer border of the psoas muscle, near tin- upper end. It is directed over the quadratus lumbonun to the iliac crest, and enters the wall of the abdomen by piercing the transversalis muscle. Its termination in the integuments of the buttock and abdomen, by means of an iliac and a hypogastric branch, has been already mentioned (p. 450). 1 b. The ilio-inguinal branch (</) arises with the preceding from the first nerve, and issues from the psoas nearly at the same spot. Of smaller size than the ilio-hypogastric, this branch courses out- wards over the quadratus and iliacus muscles towards the front of the iliac crest, where it pierces the transversalis. The farther course of the nerve in the abdominal wall, and its distribution to the scrotum and the groin, are before noticed (p. 450). c. The genito-crural nerve (h) is distributed to the cremaster muscle and the limb. It arises from the second lumbar nerve, and from the connecting loop between the first two; issuing from the front of the psoas, it descends on the surface of the muscle, and divides into the two folloAving pieces. Sometimes the nerve is divided in the psoas, and the pieces perforate the muscle separately. The genital branch descends on the external iliac artery, and furnishes offsets around it: it passes from the abdomen with the spermatic vessels, and is distributed in the cremaster muscle. In the female the nerve is lost in the round ligament. The crnral branch issues beneath Poupart's ligament to supply the integument of the thigh (p. 603). d. The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh (i) arises from the loop between the second and third nerves, and appears about the middle of the outer border of the psoas. The nerve then crosses the iliacus to the interval between the anterior iliac spinous processes, and leaves the abdomen beneath Poupart's ligament, to be dis- tributed on the outer aspect of the limb (p. 603). e. The anterior crural nerve (k) is the largest offset of the plexus, and supplies branches mainly to the extensor muscles of the knee- joint, and to the integuments of the front of the thigh and inner side of the leg. Taking origin from the second, third and fourth nerves, this large trunk appears towards the lower part of the psoas, where it lies between that muscle and the iliacus. It passes from the abdomen beneath Poupart's ligament ; but before the final branching in the thigh (p. 622), the nerve sends off the following twigs :— Some small branches to the iliacus are furnished from the outer side of the nerve. A branch to the femoral artery, the place of origin of which varies much, is distributed around the upper part of that vessel. /.

Arising in front of the anterior in the crural from the second, third, and fourth nerves in the plexus Moaiea '■ (sometimes not from the second), it makes its appearance at the inner horder of the psoas near the sacro-iliac articulation. Escaped from heneath the muscle, the nerve crosses the side of the pelvis below the external iliac, but above the obturator vessels, and enters ends in the the thigh through the aperture at the top of the thyroid foramen. thlgh' Occasionally the obturator gives origin to the following branch : — The accessory obturator nerve (I) arises from the trunk of the occasionally obturator, or from the third and fourth nerves of the plexus.

Gangliated cord of the sympathetic. The lumbar part of ^"n^the'0 the gangliated cord of the sympathetic is placed on the front of the abdomen spinal column (fig. 167, o) : it lies along the inner border of the joins that psoas muscle, and is somewhat concealed on the right side by the in 1 x' vena cava, on the left by the aorta. The cord possesses four or five' has four or oval ganglia opposite the bodies of the vertebrae, which supply e ganglia ■ connecting and visceral branches. Connecting brandies. From each ganglion two small branches are branches to directed backwards along the centre of the body of the vertebra, nerve's,"'' with the lumbar artery ; these unite with one or two spinal nerves near the intervertebral foramen. The connecting branches are long in the lumbar region, in consequence of the gangliated cord being carried forwards by the psoas muscle from the intervertebral foramina. Branches of distribution. Most of the internal branches throw an<*to themselves into the aortic and hypogastric plexuses, and so reach V18ceia' the viscera indirectly. Some filaments enter the vertebras and their connecting ligaments. Last dorsal nerve (fig. 167, e). The anterior primary branch Last dorsal of the last dorsal resembles the intercostal nerves in its distribution, "erve: but differs from them in not being contained in an intercostal space. Lying below the last rib, the nerve is directed outwards across the course to upper part of the quadratus lumborum, but beneath the external ^Mome!?? arched ligament and the fascia of the quadratus. At the outer border of that muscle it perforates the middle layer of the fascia lumborum, and enters the wall of the abdomen, where it ends in an abdominal and a lateral cutaneous branch (p. 450). The first lumbar artery accompanies it. Near the spine it furnishes a small branch to the quadratu3 muscle; branch rb and it may communicate by means of this with the first lumbar '"USClC' nerve. . The LUMBAR arteries of the aorta (p. 527) are furnished to the Lumbar back, the spinal canal, and the wall of the abdomen : they resemble flv^/nnum- the aortic intercostals in their course and distribution.

Origin of azygos veins: entrance into thorax. bodies of the last dorsal and upper four lumbar vertebra, and beneath the pillar of the diaphragm and the psoas, to ceach the interval between the transverse processes, where each ends in an aodominal and a dorsal branch. The arteries of the right, side lie beneath the vena cava. The posterior or dorsal branches continue to the back between the transverse processes, and supply offsets to the spinal canal (pp. 398, 414). The anterior or abdominal branches are directed outwards, and enter the posterior part of the abdominal wall, where they are distributed (p. 453). The first lies with the last dorsal nerve across the front of the quadratus lumborum, but the others usually pass behind that muscle. Offsets are furnished to the psoas and quadratus muscles, and to the subperitoneal fat ; the last anastomose with branches of the renal, capsular, spermatic, right and left colic, and some other visceral arteries. The lumbar VEINS are the same in number, and have the same course as the arteries. Commencing by the union of a dorsal and an abdominal branch at the root of the transverse process, each trunk is directed forwards to the vena cava. They open into the back of the cava, either singly, or conjointly with those of the opposite side. On the left side the veins are longer than on the right, and pass beneath the aorta. Around the transverse processes, and beneath the psoas muscle, the lumbar veins communicate freely with one another, with the ilio-lumbar, and with the common iliac, so as to form a plexus of veins. Issuing above from the plexus is a branch, the ascending lumbar vein, which joins the azygos vein of the corresponding side of the body. Beginning of the azygos veins. The azygos vein begins on each side about the first lumbar vertebra by the above-mentioned ascending lumbar vein ; and it is often joined by a branch of communication with the inferior cava or the renal vein, efhe right vein enters the thorax usually with the thoracic drret and the aorta, to the right of which it lies. The left vein passes through the pillars of the diaphragm, or sometimes through the aortic opening. The anatomy of these veins is given at p. 365.CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is tlie part of the general abdominal space Definition situate below the brim of the true pelvis (p. 466). tion.bltUa" Boundaries. The space is surrounded by the firm ring of the Boundaries; pelvic bones : it is bounded behind by the sacrum and coccyx, with behind and the pyriformes muscles and the sacro-sciatic ligaments; andbcfore > laterally and in front, by the hip-bones covered by the internal obturator muscles. Inferiorly, or towards the perineum, the cavity is limited by the below, fascia reflected from the wall to the viscera, and by the levatores ani and coccygei muscles : it is only in this direction, where the bounding structures are to some extent moveable, that the size of the space can be appreciably altered. Contents. In the pelvis are contained the urinary bladder with the Contents, beginning of the urethra, the lower end of the large intestine or the rectum, and some of the generative organs, according to the sex. The viscera are supplied with vessels, nerves, and lymphatics ; and the serous membrane is reflected over them. Section I. PELVIC FASCIA AND MUSCLES OF THE OUTLET. Lining the wall of the pelvis is a thin fascia (pelvic), which Outline of covers the obturator internus and pyriformis muscles, and sends a f^l ft¥s^ °r process inwards to support the viscera. 6 Pe V'S' Dissection. To bring into view the pelvic fascia, the external iliac steps to do- vessels, and the psoas (if this has not been removed in the dissec- "!le pel- turn of the lumbar plexus), are to be taken away on the left side vlcfascm: of the body. The obturator vessels and nerve are to be cut through in the on the same side ; and the peritoneum being detached from the Pelvis» wall of the pelvis, the fascia will be seen on scraping away with the handle of the scalpel a quantity of fat. By this proceeding the membrane is dissected in its upper half, or as low as the situation of the portion (recto-vesical) which is directed inwards to the viscera. To display the lower half, the student must raise the outlet of theDISSECTION OP THE PELVIS. 540 :i"!'m',im- pelviS ' anc1' sl]0uld tlie periiiLuuii be undissected, the fat must be p nenm; from ^ ^chio-rectal {qsb& The jower ^ q{ ^ fascia will now appear on the outer side of that fossa, as it cover* the obturator muscle, torn outer To see the outer surface of the fascia (fig. 168), the obturator externus muscle and the obturator membrane should be removed, Fig. 168.* with the exception of a small portion of the latter at the upper end of the thyroid foramen, where it bounds the aperture through which the vessels and nerve issue.

Lastly, by turning back the pyriformis muscle and the great ^ndover^ sciatic nerve, a thin piece of the fascia covering those structures will be exposed in the great sacro-sciatic foramen (fpy). The pelvic fascia is a thin membrane which covers the deep J^e/^t'o surface of the muscles bounding the cavity, and may be described three parts, in three parts. Two of these line the wall of the pelvis,—one V1Z-:— covering the obturator internus muscle is named the obturator fascia, and the other extending over the pyriformis muscle is the fascia of the pyriformis ; while the third enters into the formation of the floor of the cavity, and supports the rectum and bladder, whence it is known as the recto-vesical fascia. The obturator fascia (fig. 168) invests closely the pelvic portion ^",['atm' of the obturator internus muscle, and is fixed to the bone around the attachment of the fleshy fibres. Thus, it is attached above to attach- ments ■ the ilio-pectineal line of the hip-bone between the sacro-iliac articu- lation and the upper end of the thyroid foramen ; at the latter spot it joins the obturator membrane over the edge of the muscle, so as to form the floor of the canal transmitting the obturator vessels and nerve ; and in front it is fixed to the body of the pubis, following the border of the muscle. Below, it is inserted into the inner side of the inferior ramus of the pubis, and the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium in conjunction with the falciform process of the great .sacro-sciatic ligament. Behind, the membrane is fixed to the hip- bone along the anterior margin of the great sciatic notch ; and between the ischial spine and tuberosity it is united with the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where the obturator internus issues from the pelvis. From the inner surface of this membrane the recto-vesical fascia relations, is given off, along a curved line extending from the ischial spine to the upper and inner part of the thyroid foramen (fig. 168,**). Above this line the obturator fascia bounds the cavity of the pelvis, and is in contact with the peritoneum ; while below, it looks into the ischio-rectal fossa, except over a small space in front, where it is closely united with the pubic origin of the levator ani (la). The fascia of the pyriformis ('fpy) is very thin, and is continued Fascia oi backwards from the hinder part of the obturator fascia to the sacrum, Py^0™1*- passing over the front of the sacral plexus and the pyriformis muscle, but beneath the internal iliac vessels, by the gluteal, sciatic and pudic branches of which it is perforated. The recto-vesical fascia may now be seen in part by looking into fiecto- the pelvis; and the student may notice a whitish line extending uter?' from the lower part of the pubis, close to the symphysis, to the ischial spine. This line corresponds in its hinder part to the origin of the recto-vesical fascia from the obturator fascia ; but in front, the levator ani extends upwards between the two. The disposition of this part of the fascia will be better seen after the hip-bone has been taken away.542 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. To remove hip-bone : detach fascia, saw bone, and divide soft parts. Then blow- up bladder and distend other parts. Outlet of pelvis is closed by pyriformis, by coccy- gens and sacro-sciatic ligament, with vessels and nerves, by levator ani, and by triangular ligament. Coccygeus: origin : insertion ; relations of surfaces and borders; Dissection. To obtain a side-view of the pelvis (fig. 169), it will be necessary to remove the left hip-bone. The obturator fascia and great sacro-sciatic ligament are first to be detached, and then the bone is to be sawn through, in front about three-quarters of an inch outside the symphysis pubis, and behind at the articulation with the sacrum. After the bone has been pulled somewhat away from the rest of the pelvis, the ischial spine, with the recto-vesical fascia attached to it, may be cut off with a bone-forceps ; and the loose piece may then be removed by cutting through the fibres of the iliacus and pyriformis muscles, and any other structure that may retain it. A block is afterwards to be placed beneath the pelvis. The bladder is to be moderately distended with air through the ureter, and the urethra is to be tied. Some tow is to be introduced into the rectum, also into the vagina if it is a female pelvis ; and a small piece is to be placed in the pouch of peritoneum between the bladder and the rectum. After the viscera are thus made prominent without distension, the ischial spine and the recto-vesical fascia should be raised with hooks while the levator ani (d) and coccygeus (c) muscles below it are cleaned. Parts dosing the pelvis below. In addition to the recto-vesical fascia, the following parts close the pelvic cavity on each side, between the sacrum and the pubic symphysis. Behind, the student will meet with the pyriformis passing through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, with the gluteal vessels and nerve (fig. 16 8, cja and sgn) above it. Next comes the coccygeus muscle (fig. 169, o) on the small sacro-sciatic ligament, between the ischial spine and the coccyx ; one border of the muscle is contiguous to the pyriformis, the other to the levator ani ; and between its upper border and the pyriformis lie the great sciatic and pudic nerves (}•2| 3), with some other branches of the sacral plexus, and the sciatic and pudic vessels. The greater part of the pelvic outlet is closed by the levator ani, (d) which extends forwards from the coccygeus to the symphysis pubis. It meets its fellow behind, but the muscles of opposite sides are separated in front by the urethra, with the vagina in the female ; and the interval between them is closed by the triangular ligament of the perineum (h). The coccygeus muscle (fig. 169, c) is flat and triangular, and has much tendinous substance mixed with its fibres. It arises from the upper part of the ischial spine, and some fibres are attached to the adjoining part of the obturator fascia. Widening as it passes inwards, the muscle is inserted into the side, and the contiguous anterior surface of the coccyx, and into the side of the lowest piece of the sacrum. The inner surface looks to the pelvis, and is in contact with the rectum : the opposite surface is in great part covered by the small sacro-sciatic ligament, to which it is closely united. The upper- border is contiguous to the pyriformis muscle, vessels and nerves- intervening ; and the lower meets the levator ani. Action. This muscle helps the levator ani in supporting and543 LEVATOR AN I MUSCLE. raising the floor of the pelvis : it may also draw the coccyx slightly forwards. . The levator ani (fig. 169, d) is a thin flat muscle, which is Levator attached ahove to the side of the pelvis, and descends into the outlet of the cavity, where it joins its fellow and supports the situation; viscera. It arises anteriorly by tendinous fasciculi from the hack of the origin fro,, pubis along an oblique line in front of the obturator interims ; and Fig. 169.* below this some fleshy fibres often spring from the upper surface of the triangular ligament. Posteriorly it is attached to the lower and inner part of the ischial spine ; and between the osseous attach- ments the muscle takes origin in the angle between the obturator and recto-vesical portions of the pelvic fascia (along the curved line * * in fig. 168). From this wide origin the fibres converge, the anterior being directed backwards, and the posterior downwards and inwards, to be inserted in the following manner :—The most anterior fibres, few in number, join with the muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perineum; the succeeding fibres, which arise from the pubis, are the longest, and pass backwards over the prostate to the side of the rectum, where they mix with the fibres of the sphincter muscles ; and the posterior fibres meet the opposite muscle in a narrow aponeurosis behind the gut, and are attached in part to the side of the coccyx (p. 420). The anterior fibres of the levator are in contact with the trian- gular perineal ligament ; and there is an interval between the two * Side view of the muscles in the outlet of the pelvis (Illustrations of Dis- sections).

The posterior border is adjacent to the coccy- geus muscle. The upper surface is in contact with the recto-vesical fascia ; and the under surface looks to the ischio-rectal fossa, and is covered by the thin anal fascia. Action. The levatores ani acting together support and raise tin- floor of the pelvis, and compress the pelvic viscera. They arc used in expelling the contents of the abdomen, and in forcible ex- piratory efforts, acting then in conjunction with the muscles of the abdominal wall. The hindmost fibres, which are fixed to the coccyx, will assist the coccygeus in moving forwards that bone. The leva- tores ani and coccygei muscles form a fleshy layer or pelvic diaphragm across the outlet of the pelvis, similar to that which separates the abdomen from the chest: this partition is convex below and concave above, and gives passage to the rectum. Dissection. The recto-vesical fascia will be seen by detaching the fibres of the levator ani and the coccygeus at their origin, and throwing both downwards. The thin membrane descends above the levator ani to the side of the bladder and the rectum, and sends downwards sheaths round the prostate and the gut. To demon- strate those sheaths, one incision is to be made along the prostate, and another along the lower end of the rectum, below the attach- ment of the fascia ; and the tubes are to be separated from the viscera. The recto-vesical fascia supports and partly invests the viscera of the pelvis. Covering the pelvic surface of the levator ani, it is fixed above, like that muscle, to the pubis in front, and to the obturator fascia at the side ; while behind, it is continued over the coccygeus muscle into the fascia of the pyriformis. Below, it meets the fascia of the opposite side in the centre of the pelvis, and forms a partition across the cavity, like that of the levator ani, which is perforated by the bladder and the rectum. The partition is strengthened on each side by a thicker band (the so-called white line of the pelvic fascia) stretching from the pubis to the ischial spine (p. 541). It is concave above and convex below, and divides the cavity of the pelvis from the perineal space. This septum is attached to the viscera which , pierce it, forming ligaments for them ; and from the under surface tubes are prolonged on the rectum and the prostate. The sheath on the rectum encloses the lower three inches of the intestine, and gradually becomes very thin towards the anus; be- tween it and the intestine are interposed the branches of the upper hannorrhoidal vessels with a layer of fat. On the prostate the sheath is thinner than on the rectum, and very closely adherent; it is continued downwards to the apex of that body, where it passes into the upper layer of the triangular ligament of the urethra : between it and the substance of the prostate are a plexus of veins and some small arteries. In the female the fascia has much the same arrangement as in the male ; but the vagina perforates the membrane, and receives a tube from it, like the prostate.SIDE VIEW OF THE MALE PELVIS. U5 The true ligaments of the bladder are two on each side, anterior Laments and lateral, and are portions of the recto-vesical fascia. The anterior reaches from the back of the pubis to the fore ^™''ts part of the prostate and the neck of the bladder ; it is a narrow white band, and encloses muscular fibres of the bladder. The lateral ligament is the side piece of the fascia, which is fixed £f ^he^ to the upper border of the prostate gland, and to the side of the bladder; bladder close above the vesicula seminalis ; from it an offset is con- tinued in wards behind the vesicula seminalis, so as to join a like piece from the other side, and form a sheath for those bodies. There are other ligaments of the bladder (false ligaments), which are derived from the peritoneum investing it, and will be described in the following Section. Ligament of the rectum. On each side of the rectum is a strong ligament of wide piece of the recto-vesical fascia, which is attached externally to the ischial spine of the hip-bone, and supports that viscus like the bladder.

The viscera of the male pelvis Contents of are—the rectum, the bladder with the prostate and first part of the e 1>eh,s' urethra, the lower ends of the ureters, part of the vasa deferentia, and the vesiculse seminales. These have the following relative situation:— The rectum (k) lies at the back of the pelvis, and takes a curvet, and outline course in the hollow of the sacrum and coccyx. The bladder (a) is ^ositfuii placed in the concavity of the rectum, its neck being surrounded by the prostate gland (6); and the urethra, after perforating the last, curves forwards to the penis. The ureter (h) descends by the side of the rectum to the hinder part of the bladder; and the vas deferens (/) and vesicula seminalis (g) are between the bladder and rectum on each side. Some of these organs are partly invested by peritoneum. Dissection.

The peritoneum does not envelop the viscera in the pelvis so completely as in the upper part of the abdomen. After surround- ing the upper portion of the rectum, and forming a fold (irmo- rectum) behind it, the membrane covers the upper surface of the bladder, and projects for some way between the two viscera, thus giving rise to the recto-vesical pouch (fig. 145, 7-17)): on each Fig. 170.* The peri- toneum covers partly the rectum ; and partly the bladder leaving front and lower part free.

All the front and lower part of the bladder are therefore uncovered by peritoneum ; and when the bladder is distended it rises above the pubic bones, so as to allow of its being opened in front without injury to the serous membrane. The recto-vesical pouch is wide above, where il corresponds with, the interval between the iliac arteries, and is narrow below between the rectum and bladder. It descends slightly into the interval between the vesiculao seminales, and ends usually at a line joining the spots where the ureters enter the wall of the Madder.

Beneath it are the internal iliac vessels, the obliterated hypogastric artery, the ureter, and the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic. The lateral false ligament (also one on each side) is the widest, and lateral; is reflected from the side of the bladder to the iliac fossa and the wall of the pelvis. It is separated from the posterior and superior liga- ments by the obliterated hypogastric artery. The superior false ligament is the portion of peritoneum between superior the two obliterated hypogastric arteries, reflected from the upper surface of the bladder over the urachus to the anterior abdominal wall. The rectum, or last part of the great intestine (fig. 1*70, k), Rectum; extends from the brim of the pelvis, near the sacro-iliac articulation extent ami i if the left side, to the anus, and is about eight inches long. The bowel has a sinuous course, for it first follows the curve of the sacrum course and and coccyx, and then inclines backwards to the anus ; and it is supports; supported mainly by the peritoneum, the recto-vesical fascia, and the perineal muscles. For convenience of description it is divided into divisions, three parts :— The upper portion, longer than the others, extends to the centre of First part the third piece of the sacrum. It is almost entirely surrounded by covered by peritoneum, which forms a distinct fold, or meso-7-ectum, between its peritoneum, upper end and the front of the sacrmn, so that some degree of move- ailieT" mentfrom side to side is permitted. Behind it are the sacrum, with relations, the pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus of the left side ; and the left ureter and internal iliac vessels are adjacent to it, but separated by the peritoneum.* The middle portion lies behind the bladder, and reaches to the tip Second part of the coccyx ; it is about three inches in length, and is covered by is fixi''1: peritoneum in front for about the upper half of its extent. Im- mediately below this it pierces ttie recto-vesical fascia, and receives its sheath from that membrane. Resting on it is the triangular relations, part of the bladder, with the vesiculaj seminalesand vasa deferentia; and beneath it are the sacrum and coccyx. On each side is the coccygeus muscle. The lower portion is about an inch and a half long, and is curved Third parti* largest : In some bodies the first part of the rectum is much curved to the right side ; and occasionally this piece of the intestine lies altogether on the right of the sacrum, the lower end of the left colon crossing the spine at the brim of the pelvis.

Apex has three cords from it. Base : parts ill contact with it. Surfaces : inferior, .superior from the tip of the coccyx to the anus : at first it is dilated, but at the anus it is contracted. This end of the intestine is without peritoneal covering, and is supported by the triangular ligament of the urethra, and by the levatorea ani and external sphincter muscles. In front of the extremity of the rectum are the prostate, the membranous part of the urethra, and the bulb of the corpus spon- giosum urethrse ; but as the gut recedes from the urethra there is an angular interval left between the two. The levatorea ani muscles descend on its sides, and unite beneath it, supporting it in a Bling ; and the sphincter muscles surround the aperture. Sometimes the end of the intestine within the anus is very much enlarged, especially in women and old men ; and in that condition in the male it rises up on each side of the prostate. The urinary bladder (vesica urinaria; fig. 170, a) is the receptacle for the urine, and is situate in the fore part of the pelvis. When the bladder is contracted it is flattened, and of a triangular form, and lies agamst the anterior wall of the pelvis ; but when distended it becomes rather egg-shaped, with the larger part towards the rectum, and the apex to the abdominal wall. In distension during life it is slightly curved forwards over the pubic bones, and projects above them ; and if its axis were prolonged, it would touch the abdominal wall anteriorly a variable distance (according to the distension) above the pubic symphysis, and the lower end of the sacrum posteriorly. The position and form of the bladder are not the same in early life as in the adult. For in the child this viscus rises much above the brim of the pelvis into the hypogastric region of the abdomen, and the part near the neck is elongated. But in the adult tin- bladder is for the most part contained within the space enclosed by the pelvic bones, and the base projects backwards. The organ is maintained in position by the recto-vesical fascia and the peritoneum, which form its ligaments (pp. 545 and 547). The relations of the moderately full bladder are as follows :— The summit or apex is rounded, and from it three ligamentous cords are prolonged to the umbilicus ; the central one of these is the urachus; and the two lateral are the obliterated hypogastric arteries. All the surface belrind the obliterated vessels is covered by peritoneum. The base or fundus is large, and rests against the middle piece of the rectum. Connected with the fundus are the vesiculse seminales and the vasa deferentia; and between these is a triangular space, from which the peritoneum is mostly absent. The ureter opens into the upper part of the base on each side. Surfaces of the body. The inferior or pubic surface of the body is in contact with the pubic bones and anterior true ligamenta, as well as with the abdominal wall if the bladder is very full, and is altogether free from peritoneum. The superior or abdominal surface is entirely covered by the serous membrane, and has the small intestine andRELATIONS OP THE PEOSTATE. 549 sigmoid flexure resting on it: the vas deferens courses over the hinder part of this surface beneath the peritoneum. Extending along the upper part of each lateral region is the and lateral, obliterated hypogastric artery, which marks the extent of the peri- toneal covering at the side. The surface below this is connected with the pelvic fascia by very loose areolar tissue. , The neck (cervix) is the part of the bladder near the urethra, and Neck, is surrounded by the prostate gland. This is the lowest part of the organ. When the bladder is empty, the upper wall falls upon the lower; Condition the apex lies at the' upper end of the pubic symphysis ; and the base Slander?' is of very small extent and looks downwards. In a vertical section the cavity then appears as a slit, which is continued backwards for a short distance beyond the beginning of the urethra. The ureter (fig. 170, h) crosses the common or the external iliac Ureter in artery, and inclines forwards below the level of the obliterated hypo- relvis> gastric artery, being covered by the peritoneum constituting the posterior false ligament of the bladder. It enters the bladder at the enters upper and outer part of the base, at the distance of one inch and a bladder, half or two inches from the prostate gland. The prostate gland (fig. 170, b) surrounds the neck of the Prostate: bladder. Its shape is conical with the base turned upwards, and position; its size about equals that of a large chestnut. In the present form; position of the pelvis, a line from the apex through the middle of axis; Ihe gland would be directed obliquely backwards and slightly down- wards towards the sacrum ; but in the erect state of the body the axis is nearly vertical. The anterior surface is about three-quarters of an inch from the relations of symphysis pubis, to which it is attached by the anterior true liga- surface" ments of the bladder. On this surface the dorsal vein of the penis divides to enter the prostatic plexus. The posterior surface has the posterior greatest extent, and is close to the rectum ; this is the part that is surrace> felt by the finger introduced into the bowel through the anus. On and side ; each side the prostate is covered by the levator ani.

The vesiculas are contained in a membranous sheath, which is derived from the recto-vesical fascia, and is lined by invol- untary muscular fibres. The vas deferens or the excretory duct of the testis (fig. 170,/) in its course to the urethra enters the abdomen by the internal abdominal ring, and crossing the obliterated hypogastric artery, is directed downwards along the hinder part of the bladder to the base of the prostate, where it forms the common seminal or ejaculatoi v duct by joining with the duct from the vesicula seminalis. Tin- position of this tube to the external iliac artery has been noticed ; on the bladder it passes internal to the ureter and the vesicula of the same side. By the side of the vesicula the duct is much enlarged, and is sacculated. The urethra is the excretory passage for the urine and semen (fig. 170), and reaches from the bladder to the end of the penis. In length it measures about eight inches, and it presents one or two curves according to the state of the penis. At first the canal is directed downwards and forwards through the triangular ligament of the perineum to the root of the penis, forming a large curve with the concavity to the pubis. Thence to its termination the urethra is contained in the penis ; and while this body remains pendent the, canal forms a second bend with the concavity downwards; but if the penis is raised the tube makes but one curve. The canal is divided into three parts,—prostatic, membranous, and spongy. The prostatic part (b) is contained in the prostate gland, and receives its name from that circumstance. Its length is about one inch and a quarter, and in the erect posture of the body it descends nearly vertically to the triangular ligament. The membranous part (c), about three-quarters of an inch long, intervenes between the apex of the prostate and the lower surface of the triangular ligament. It slants forwards in the erect posture to the lower part of the triangular ligament ; and as the bulb of the next portion of the urethral tube is directed backwards below it, the under surface measures only half an inch. This division of the urethra is the weakest; but it is supported by the triangular ligament (n). Surrounding it are the muscular fibres of the constrictor urethra ; and close behind it are Cowper's glands and the rectum. The spongy part (d) is so named from its being surrounded by a cellido-vascular structure. It is applied to and assists to form the body of the penis, and terminates anteriorly in the orifice named meatus urinarius at the end of the glans. It is the longest part of the urethra, and measures about six inches. At its commencement this division of the excretory canal is covered by the ejaculatoi' nrinro muscle (fig. 133). The curve of the urethra is the fixed bend at the hinder part of the canal which lies behind the pubis. It extends from the bladder to an inch and a half in front of the aperture in the triangular ligament, and comprises the prostatic and membranous portions,551 URETHRA AND PENIS. with a fourth of the spongy part. Its convexity, which is turned ^ere^ downwards and backwards, is greatest immediately below the triangular ligament in the erect posture of the body ; and from this point it ascends to the bladder, but is directed nearly horizontally forwards to the penis. It is surrounded bv voluntary and involuntary muscular fibres : Voluntary i -i • n , t .. and mvo- thus, above the ligament, by the involuntary muscular tissue oi iUntary the prostate ; within the ligament by the voluntary constrictor ™"^d it urethrae, with a thin involuntary layer inside that muscle ; and below the ligament by the voluntary ejaculator urinse. Its size is smallest where the tube pierces the perineal liga-Slzu- ment (n), and lies between the layers ; and it is largest in the middle of the prostate. Dissection. The teguuientary covering of the penis may be com- Dissections pletely removed, to see the components of that body ; and after its removal the spongy part of the urethra will be better seen. The skin should be replaced after the penis has been learnt. The penis is attached to the fore part of the pelvis, and hangs in Consti- . tuciits fimi front of the scrotum. It is constructed of two firm fibrous bodies situation oi (fig. 170, e) named corpora cavernosa, which are filled with antheiienis: areolar structure containing blood. Below these is a soft spongy substance (corpus spongiosum) which surrounds the urethra, and forms the head or the glans penis. The icgumentary investment, which covers the whole, is noticed at p. 439. The body of the penis is rather prismatic in shape. The upper *^jJJnei, surface is slightly grooved along the middle line ; and the lower ' rounded border is formed by the corpus spongiosum, which is received into a larger groove between the corpora cavernosa. Besides the attachment of the corpora cavernosa to the bone, the body of the penis is connected with the front of the symphysis pubis by the suspensory ligament (p. 439). The corpus spongiosum urethra: encloses the urethral canal beyond Corpus the triangular ligament, and forms the head of the penis. It is a sPon8los'"" vascular and erectile texture, like the corpora cavernosa, but is much less strong. Commencing posteriorly by a dilated part—the .surrounds bulb, it extends forwards around the urethra to the extremity of ^1™;,?"'' the penis, where it swells into the conical glans penis. The bulb (fig. 170, d) is directed backwards below the mem- the bulb, branous part of the urethra, and is firmly united to the under surface of the triangular ligament. The ejaculator ivrinso muscles cover it. This enlargement presents usually a slight central de- which is pression, with a bulging on each side, forming two lateral lobes.

And in front of all are the-bladder and the urethra. Thus, there are three tubes connected with the viscera in this sex, viz., the urethra, the vagina, and the rectum ; and all are directed downwards to the surface. Directions. The description in Section I (p. 539) is to be used for instructions respecting the removal of the hip-bone, and the distension of the viscera ; also for the muscles of the pelvic outlet and the anatomy of the fasciae. After the student has learnt the muBcles aud the fascia (p. 541), which are nearly alike in both .sexes, he may make the following special dissection of the viscera of the female pelvis. Dissection. On taking away the recto-vesical fascia and much fat, the viscera will come into view. To maintain the position of the uterus, raise it up with a piece of string passed through the upper end. The reflections of the peritoneum on the viscera are to be preserved ; and a piece of cotton-wool is to be placed between the rectum and the uterus. The obliterated cord of the hypogastric artery is to be followed on the bladder ; and the ureter is to be traced forwards by the side of the uterus to the bladder. , Afterwards the urethra, the vagina, and the rectum are to be cleaned and separated a little from one another at the lower part of the pelvis ; but the arteries on the rectum are to be preserved. The peritoneum gives a partial covering to the viscera, as in the male pelvis. Investing the upper part of the rectum, and forming behind it the nieso-rectum, the membrane is continued to the back of the vagina and uterus. It covers the posterior, and most of the anterior surface of the uterus, and can be traced to the bladder with- out again touching the vagina : on each side of the uterus it forms a wide fold (broad ligament), which attaches that viscus to the wall of the pelvis. As the peritoneum is followed forwards it may be observed to cover the upper surface of the bladder, and the lateral surface above the position of the obliterated hypogastric artery. In the pelvis the serous membrane forms the following ligaments for the uterus and bladder. The broad ligament of the uterus (fig. 171) passes from the side of I lie uterus to the wall of the abdomen, and supports that organ. By its position across the pelvis, it divides the cavity into an553 LIGAMENTS OF THE UTERUS. anterior and a posterior space : in the former the bladder is placed; in the latter the upper part of the rectum, the small intestine, and the sigmoid flexure when it reaches the pelvis.

The anterior or vesico-uterine pair is smaller than the pos- terior or recto-uterine. The rectouterine pouch, also called recto-vaginal, corresponds with Jj^°"e the recto-vesical in the male. On each side it is bounded by the pouch, obliterated hypogastric artery ; and below, it reaches beyond the uterus, so as to touch the back of the vagina. The vesico-uterine pouch is between the uterus and bladder, and is ^.Jjne much smaller than the foregoing. pouch. The false ligaments of the bladder are five in number, the same as Five liga- in the male, viz., two posterior, two lateral, and a superior : they bladder^ ^ are all parts of one large piece of peritoneum that reaches from the bladder to the side and front of the pelvis. The posterior ligaments, containing the vessels of the bladder, are identical with the vesico- uterine folds, and are much smaller than in the male. The rectum (fig. 171, k) is not so curved in the female as in the Relations 01 tllC T6C- male, and is generally larger. Descending along the middle of the turn viz. sacrum and coccyx to the anus, the intestine is divided into three parts :— The upper portion ends over the third piece of the sacrum, and is of ftrst> enveloped by the peritoneum : its relations are similar to those of the rectum in the male (p. 547). The middle portion reaches to the tip of the coccyx, and has the eoond, vagina in front, and in contact with it. The peritoneum extends on the front for a short distance. The lower piece curves to the anus away from the vagina so as to autl tuircl leave between the two a space which corresponds, on the surface P!" of the body, with the perineum between the anus and the vulva. The levatores ani are on the sides, and unite below it, and the sphincter muscles surround the extremity.

One end is con- nected to the uterus close to the fundus, while the other is folded round the ovary. At the uterine end the tube is of small size, but at the opposite extremity it is dilated like a trumpet, and fringed, forming the corpus fimbriatum: one of the fimbriae is attached to i he upper part of the ovary. The ovaet (l) is oval in form, but rather flattened, and very Ovary, variable in size. It forms a projection at the back of the broad ligament, and is invested by the peritoneum except along one (the attached) border. In the natural condition it lies nearly vertically against the side wall of the pelvis, and is embraced by the outer part of the Fallopian tube : the direction of its free border varies. Its lower end, which is directed somewhat forwards, is attached to ami its the uterus by a special fibrous band, about one inch and a half in ''S"""'"1- length, the ligament of the ovary. The vagina (fig. 171, i) is the tube by which the uterus conmm- Vagina: nicates with the exterior of the body. It is compressed from f^".tuni1 before back ; and its length is about three inches. As it follows ]en„tll. the bend of the rectum, it is slightly curved ; and its axis corre- axjs. sponda below with that of the outlet, but higher up with that of the <;avity of the pelvis. In front of the vagina are the base of the Madder, and the relations, urethra ; and behind it is the rectum, but the peritoneum inter- venes between the two for a short distance at the upper end. It is transmitted through an opening in the recto-vesical fascia, which sends a sheath along the lower half of the tube ; and the levator ani lies along the side external to this. The upper end receives the neck of the uterus by an aperture in the anterior wall'; and the lower end, the narrowest part of the canal, is encircled by the sphincter vaginae muscle, A large plexus of veins surrounds the vagina within its sheath. In children, and in the virgin, the ex- ternal aperture is partly closed by the hymen (p. 432). The bladder (fig. 171, h) is placed at the fore part of the pelvis, Bladder _ in front of the vagina, and in contact with the back of the pubic bones. Its position and relations so closely resemble those of the bladder in the male body, as to render unnecessary a separate de- resembles scription of them (p. 548). The chief differences'in the bladder n?a*e°ftl,c of the two sexes are the following :— In the female the bladder is more globular than in the male, and differences the transverse often exceeds the vertical measurement. The base is ^c tw" of less extent, and is in contact with the vagina and the neck of the uterus. The vasa deferentia, vesiculoe seminales, and prostate are absent. The ureter has a longer course in the female than in the male Course of pelvis before it reaches the bladder. After crossing the internal "retei- iliac vessels, it passes by the neck of the uterus to its destination.

In its course to the surface it is embedded in the tissue of the vaginal wall, and perforates the triangular ligament of the peri- neum, where it is surrounded by fibres of the deep transverse muscle, and a layer of circular involuntary fibres (p. 434). A plexus of veins surrounds the urethra as well as the vagina. Section IV. VESSELS AND NEKVES OP THE PELVIS. In the pelvis are contained the internal iliac vessels and their branches to the viscera, the sacral plexus of nerves, and the sym- pathetic nerve. This section is to be used by the dissectors of both the male and female pelvis. Directions. The internal iliac vessels are to be dissected on the right side. The air should be previously let out of the bladder; and this viscus and the rectum, with the uterus and the vagina in the female, should be drawn aside from their situation in the centre of the pelvis. Dissection. The loose tissue and fat are to be removed from the trunks of the vessels, as well as from the branches of the artery that leave the pelvis, or supply the viscera; and the cord of the obliterated hypogastric artery is to be traced on the bladder to the umbilicus. With the vessels are offsets of the hypogastric plexus of nerves, though these will probably not be seen; but in dissecting the vessels to the bladder and rectum, branches of the sacral spinal nerves will come into view. The veins may be removed in a general dissection. When the vessels are prepared the bladder may be again dis- tended, and the viscera replaced. The internal iliac artery (fig. 172, g) is one of the trunks resulting from the division of the common iliac artery, and furnishes branches to the viscera and wall of the pelvis, to the organs of generation, and to the limb. In the adult the vessel is a short trimk of large capacity, which measures from an inch to an inch and a half in length. Directed downwards towards the great sacro-sciatic foramen, the artery termi- nates generally in two large pieces, from which the several offeets are furnished. From the extremity a partly obliterated vessel (hypogastric) extends forwards on the bladder. The artery is covered by the peritoneum, and the ureter crosses its upper end obliquely on the inner side. It lies on the sacrum and lumbo-sacral cord. It is accompanied by the internal iliac vein, which is posterior to it, and somewhat to its inner side.557 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The branches of the artery are numerous, and arise usually in the branches following manner :— From the posterior piece of the trunk three arise, viz., the ilio-lunibar, lateral sacral, and gluteal. And from the anterior portion come the upper vesical, lower vesical (vaginal in female), middle hseinorrhoidal, obturator, sciatic, and pudic ; and in the female also the uterine artery.

At that time it is larger than the external iliac artery ; find, entering but slightly into the cavity of the pelvis, it is directed on the forwards to the bladder, and along the side of that viscus to the bladder, apex. Beyond the bladder the artery ascends along the posterior aspect aml beyond; of the abdominal wall with the urachus, converging to its fellow. Finally, at the umbilicus, the vessels of opposite sides come in con- tact with the umbilical vein, and, passing from the abdomen through the aperture at that spot, enter into the placental cord, where they receive the name umbilical. In the foetus, branches similar to those in the adult are furnished branches, by the artery, though their relative size at the two periods is very different. Change to adult state. When uterine life has ceased, the hypo- Transforma- i^astric artery shrinks in consequence of the arrest of the current "j.1^ of blood through it, and finally becomes obliterated, more or less adult, completely, to within an inch or so of its commencement. The part of the trunk which is unobliterated becomes the internal iliac ; and commonly a portion of the vessel remains pervious as far as the bladder, forming the superior vesical artery.

Gluteal artery : The lateral sacral arteries (fig. 172, i) are commonly two in number, superior and inferior: they correspond in situation with the lumbar arteries, and form a chain of anastomoses by the side of the apertures in the sacrum. These arteries supply the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles, and anastomose with each other, as well as with the middle sacral. A spinal branch enters each aperture in the sacrum. The gluteal artery (fig. 1 72, m) is the continuation of the posterior division of the internal iliac, and is destined for the gluteal muscles i m the outer surface of the hip-bone. It is a short, thick trunk, which leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, above the pyriformis muscle, with its accompanying vein and the nail superior gluteal nerve. In the pelvis the artery gives small branches lsl;t's- to the contiguous muscles, viz., iliacus, pyriformis, and obturator, and a twig to the hip-bone. * Dissection of the internal iliac artery (Tiedernann).

The superior vesical artery is the imperfectly obliterated portion xjpper of the fcetal hypogastric artery. It divides into three or four vesical, branches, which ramify over the apex and body of the bladder: the lowest of these is sometimes called the middle vesical branch. The inferior vesical artery often arises in common with the branch Lower to the rectum. It is distributed to the base of the bladder, the vesical vesiculse seminales, and the prostate. A small offset from this artery, or from the upper vesical, is furnished to the vas deferens. The vaginal artery (fig. 171, e) of the female takes the place of or vaginal, the inferior vesical of the male. It descends on the vagina, and ramifies in its wall as low as the outer orifice. This branch is often given off by the uterine artery. The middle hemorrhoidal artery commonly arises from the inferior Middle vesical (or vaginal), or from the pudic trunk. It is spent on the J.^^" anterior and lower part of the rectum, and anastomoses with the other haemorrhoidal arteries. The obturator artery (fig. 172, k) is directed forwards below Obtnrato, the brim of the pelvis to the aperture at the top of the thyroid "!?ry foramen : passing through that opening it ends in two branches, across which ramify on the membrane closing the thyroid foramen, pehls • beneath the obturator externus muscle. In the pielvis the artery offsets in' lias its companion nerve above, and vein below it ; and it gives l'elvis > origin to the following small branches :— The iliac branch enters the iliac fossa to supply the bone and the iliac branch: iliacus muscle ; it anastomoses with the ilio-lumbar artery. The pubic branch (fig. 143,/) ascends on the posterior aspect of P"hic the pubis, and communicates with the corresponding branch of the opposite side, and with an offset from the epigastric artery. Sometimes the obturator takes origin from the epigastric, or the external iliac artery. The sciatic artery (fig. 172, n) is the next largest branch to the Sciatic gluteal, and is continued over the pyrifonnis muscle and the sacral artery plexus to the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, where it inthepelvis, issues between the pyriformis and the coccygeus muscles. External to the pelvis it divides into branches beneath the gluteus maximus, and outside and is distributed to the buttock: in the pelvis it supplies the ^ pyriformis and coccygeus muscles. The internal pudic artery (fig. 172, o) supplies the perineum and Pudic the genital organs, and has nearly the same relations in the pelvis ^epelvia- as the sciatic. It accompanies the sciatic artery, though external to it, and leaves the pelvis between the pyriformis and coccygeus. At the back of the pelvis it winds over the ischial spine of the hip- bone, and enters the perineal space (p. 421). The artery gives some unimportant offsets in the pelvis, and frequently the middle some small lucmorrhoidal branch arises from it. oflfeets. Accessory pudic (R. Quain).

Ovarian artery : offsets. deficient branches are derived from an accessory artery, which takes origin from the internal iliac (mostly from the trunk of the pudic), and courses forwards on the side of the bladder and the prostate gland, to perforate the triangular ligament. It furnishes brandies to the penis to supply the place of those that are wanting. The uterine artery (fig. 171, d) passes inwards between the layers of the broad ligament to the neck of the. uterus, where the vessel changes its direction, and ascends to the fundus. Numerous branches enter the substance of the uterus, and ramifying in it, are remark- able for their tortuous condition. - At the neck of the uterus some small twigs are supplied to the vagina and the bladder ; and opposite the ovary a branch bends outwards to anastomose with the ovarian artery of the aorta. The internal iliac vein receives the blood from the wall of the pelvis, and the pelvic viscera, by branches corresponding for the most part with those of the artery. The vein is a short thick trunk, which is situate at the posterior and inner aspect of the artery ; and it ends by uniting with the external iliac to form the common iliac vein. Branches. Most of the branches entering the trunk of the in- ternal iliac vein have the same anatomy as the arteries ; but the following branches,—the pudic and dorsal of the penis, the vesical and hemorrhoidal, the uterine and vaginal, have some peculiarities. The pudic veins receive roots corresponding the pudic artery in the perineum (p. 430), sponding with the offsets of the artery on the dorsum of the penis. The dorsal vein of the penis (p. 440) receives veins from the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum of the penis, and entering the pelvis below the symphysis pubis, divides into two, a right and a left branch, which join a large plexus round the prostate (prostatic plexus). The middle hcemorrhoidal vein communicates with a large plexus (hemorrhoidal) around the lower end of the rectum beneath the mucous membrane (p. 579). The vesical veins begin in a plexus about the fundus of the bladder, and anastomose with the prostatic and hemorrhoidal veins. The uterine veins are numerous, and form a plexus in and by the side of the uterus : this plexus inosculates above with the ovarian plexus, and below with one on the vagina. The vaginal veins surround their tube with a large vascular plexus (p. 582). The arteries in the pelvis, which are not derived from the inter- nal iliac, are the ovarian, superior hsemorrhoidal, and middle sacral. The ovarian artery (p. 528), after passing the brim of the pelvis, becomes tortuous, and enters the broad ligament to be dis- tributed to the ovary: it supplies an offset to the Fallopian tube, and another to the round Ligament; and a large branch anastomoses internally with the uterine artery. with the branches of but not those corre-561 SACEAL NERVES. The superior hemorrhoidal artbry, the continuation behind Superior the rectum of the inferior mesenteric (p. 482), divides into two rhoidaf branches near the middle of the sacrum. From the point of division the branches are continued along the rectum, one on each side, and each ends in about three branches, which pierce the muscular layer of the gut three inches from the anus ; they terminate oppo- encls iu site the internal sphincter in anastomotic loops beneath the mucous loops, membrane, and anastomose with the middle and inferior h£emorrhoi- dal arteries.

The arteiy gives small branches laterally, oppo- lateral site each piece of the sacrum, to anastomose with the lateral sacral offsets- arteries, and to supply the nerves, and the bones with the perios- teum. Sometimes a small branch is furnished by it to the lower end of the rectum, to take the place of the middle hsemorrhoidal artery. The middle sacral veins end in the left common iliac. Dissection (fig. 173). To dissect the nerves of the pelvis, on the Dissection right side, it will be necessary to detach the triangular ligament ofthepeYvisS with the urethra from the bone ; and to cut through, on the right side, the fore part of the recto-vesical fascia and levator ani, together with the visceral arteries, in order that the viscera may be drawn from the side of the pelvis. If the bladder is distended, let the air escape from it. By means of the foregoing dissection the sacral nerves may be first four found as they issue from the sacral foramina. The dissector should sacral> follow the first four into the sacral plexus, and some branches from the third and fourth to the viscera. The last sacral and the coccy- last and geal nerve are of small size, and will be detected coming through the coccvo'<»l. coccygeus muscle, close to the coccyx : these are to be dissected with care; and the student will succeed best by tracing the connecting filaments which pass from one to another, beginning above with the offset from the fourth nerve. Opposite the lower part of the rectum, bladder, and vagina is sympa- a large plexus of the sympathetic (pelvic plexus), which sends thetic' branches to the viscera along the arteries. This plexus is generally destroyed in the previous dissection ; but if any of it remains, the student may trace the offsets distributed from it, and its communi- cating branches with the spinal nerves. Sacral Spinal Nerves (figs. 173 and 174). The anterior sacral primary branches of the sacral nerves are five in number, and nerv^a aro decrease rapidly in size from above downwards. Issuing by the VC = apertures in the front of the sacrum (the fifth nerve excepted), they receive short filaments of communication from the gangliated cord of the sympathetic. The first three nerves and part of the fourth enter the sacral plexus, but the fifth ends on the back of the {!lcxu.s"ter coccyx.

The fifth nerve (5 S) comes forwards between the sacrum and coccyx, and receives the communicating branch from the fourth nerve ; it is then directed downwards in front of the coccygeus, where it is joined by the coccygeal nerve, and perforates that muscle, the sacro-sciatic liga- ment, and the gluteus maxi- mus, to end on the posterior surface of the coccyx.

This plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the first three sacral nerves, and part of the fourth sacral. It is situate on the piriformis muscle, beneath the sciatic and pudic branches of the internal iliac artery ; and the nerv es entering it converge towards the large sacro-sciatic foramen.

The nerve to the guadratus femoris and inferior gemellus (oJ arises from the front of the plexus below the preceding. Sympathetic Nerve. In the pelvis the sympathetic nerve consists of a gangliated cord, and of a plexus on each side. The gangliated cord (fig. 173) lies on the front of .the sacrum, internal to the series of apertures in that bone. Inferiorly it con- verges to its fellow, and is united with it by a loorj in front of the coccyx, on which there is often a median ganglion {gang, impar). Each cord is marked by ganglia at intervals, the number varying from three to five : from them branches of communication pass outwards to the spinal nerves, and some filaments are directed inwards in front of the sacrum. The connecting branches are usually two to each ganglion, grey and white, and are very short. The internal branches are small, and communicate around the middle sacral artery with the branches of the opposite side. From the first, or first two ganglia, some filaments are furnished to the pelvic plexus; and from the terminal loop offsets descend over the coccyx. The pelvic plexuses (lateral inferior hypogastric) are two in number, right and left, and are continuous with the lateral pro- longations of the hypogastric plexus (p. 483). Each is situate by the side of the bladder and rectum in the male, and by the side ofSYMPATHETIC NERVE. 565 the uterus and vagina in the female, and is united with offsets of situation; the third and fourth sacral nerves.

From each plexus offsets are furnished along the branches offsets to of the internal iliac artery to the viscera of the pelvis, and the genital 0f the male, organs: these form secondary plexuses, and have the same name as viz-> the vessels on which they are placed. The inferior hemorrhoidal plexus is an offset from the back of to the the plexus to the rectum, and joins the sympathetic on the superior hemorrhoidal artery (p. 483). The vesical plexus contains large offsets, with many white-fibred to the or spinal nerves, and passes forwards to the side and neck of the ' bladder. It gives one plexus to the vesicula seminalis, and another to the vas deferens. The prostatic plexus leaves the front of the pelvic plexus, and to the pro- supplies the substance of the prostate. At the front of the prostate p^£?ntl an offset (cavernous) is continued onwards to the dorsum of the penis, to supply the cavernous structure. On the penis the cavernous nerves join the pudic nerve. In the female there are the following additional plexuses for the offsets in supply of the viscera peculiar to that sex :— the female> Ovarian plexus. The chief nerves to the ovary are derived from to the the renal and aortic plexuses (p. 483), and accompany the artery of ovary: that body ; but the uterine nerves supply some filaments to it. Vaginal nerves. The nerves of the vagina are large, and are not to the plexiform, but consist in greater part of spinal nerve-fibres ; they vagina ■ end in the lower part of the tube. The uterine nerves are furnished to the uterus with only a small and to the admixture of the spinal nerves : they ascend along the side of the uteim uterus, and consist of long slender filaments without ganglia or communications. The Fallopian tube receives its branches from the uterine nerves. Some few nerves surrounding the arteries of the uterus are plexi- form aud ganglionic. The lymphatic glands of the pelvis form one chain in front Chain of pel- of the sacrum, and another along the internal iliac vessels : their V10 glands' efferent ducts join the lumbar glands. Into these glands the deep lymphatics of the penis, those of the genital organs in the female, e^lj^'^ and the lymphatics of the viscera and wall of the pelvis are col- them. g lected. Section V.

The bladder and the bodies at its base, viz., the vesiculae seminales, and the prostate gland, are to be taken first for examina- tion.DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 566 Dissection. To study the form and structure of the viscera, it will be necessary to remove them from the pelvis. For this purpose the student should carry the scalpel round the pelvic outlet, close to the osseous boundary, so as to detach the crus of the penis from the bone, and the end of the rectum from the parts around. When the viscera are removed, the rectum is to be separated from the other organs ; but the bladder, the penis, and the urethra are to remain united. After the bladder has been distended with air, the areolar tissue is to be removed from the muscular fibres. The prostate gland and the vesiculae seminales are then to be cleaned; and the duct of the latter, with the vas deferens, is to be followed to the gland. If any of the integument has been left on the penis it is to be taken away. THE PROSTATE GLAND AND SEMINAL VESICLES. Prostate Prostate Gland (fig. 175). This is a firm muscular body con- 8'and: taming glands, which surrounds the neck of the bladder and the situation; beginning of the urethra. Its relations have been enumerated at p. 549. lorm; The prostate is conical in form, like a chestnut, with the base or dimensions; larger end directed upwards. Its dimensions are the following :— Transversely at the base it measures about an inch and a half; from apex to base an inch and a quarter ; and from before back about tlrree-quarters of an inch or an inch : so that an incision directed obliquely outwards and backwards will be the longest that can be and weight, practised in the half of this body. Its weight is about an ounce, but in this respect it varies greatly. Surfaces; The anterior surface of the prostate is narrow and rounded. The posterior surface, larger and flatter, is marked by a median hollow which indicates the division into lateral lobes. base; The base is thick, and at its posterior part has a median notch, and apex, which receives the common seminal ducts. The apex is pierced by the urethra. Three lobes, Three lobes are described in the prostate, viz., a middle and two two lateral, lateral, though there is no fissure in the firm mass. The lateral lobes (fig. 175, b, c) are similar on the two sides, and are separated only by the hollow on the under surface ; they form the chief part of the prostate, and are prolonged back, on each side, beyond the notch in and a cen- the base. The middle lobe (d) will be brought into view by detach- trai. jng vesiculas seminales and the vasa deferentiafrom the bladder: it is the piece of the gland between the neck of the bladder and the seminal ducts, which extends across between the lateral lobes. Oftentimes the middle lobe is enlarged in old people, and projects upwards into the bladder, so as to interfere with the flow of the urine from that viscus, or the passage of a catheter into it. Gland con- The urethra and the two common seminal ducts are contained in tubestlue0 tne substance of the prostate (fig. 177).

On a section the gland appears reddish grey in colour, structure, is very firm to the feel, and is scarcely lacerable. It is made up of a mass of muscular and fibrous tissues, with interspersed glandu- lar structure ; and the whole is enveloped by a fibrous sheath derived from the recto-vesical fascia (p. 544). Muscular tissue. The firm mass of this body consists mainly of Muscular involuntary muscular fibres, intermixed with elastic and fibrous p^rn-^" tissues. One set of muscular fibres is arranged circularly round the urethral canal,—these are continuous above with the annular circular, fibres of the bladder, and below with a thin layer of circular fibres .surrounding the membranous portion of the urethra ; others run transversely behind the urethra, and radiate in each lateral lobe radiating, through the glandular substance ; and over the greater part of the an(1 surface is an external stratum, forming a kind of capsule, which superficial; adheres to the fibrous sheath. Along the front and towards the and striped, apex, the superficial part of the organ is composed of striated mus- cular fibres, also disposed transversely, which are continued into the constrictor urethra? muscle between the layers of the triangular liga- ment. Glandular substance. This is composed of a number of small Glands in branched glands, which are embedded in the muscular stroma. masses- There are three chief collections,—a small one in the central lobe, and a larger one in each lateral lobe. The ducts of the glands vary ducts open in number from twelve to twenty, and open into the prostatic part '"^?tm!£ of the urethra (p. 573). Blood-vessels. The arteries are small, and are furnished by the Arteries, inferior vesical and middle haeniorrhoidal. The veins form a plexus round the gland, which receives in front the dorsal vein of the penis, veins form and is continued behind into the plexus at the base of the bladder. a plexus. In old men these vessels may give rise to considerable haunorrhage in the operation of lithotomy. The nerves are supplied from the pelvic plexus. The lymphatics Nerves, of this body and of the vesicidoa seminales are received into the Lymphatics, glands by the side of the internal iliac artery. VESicr/LiE Seminales (fig. 175, e).

It is sur- rounded by longitudinal involuntary muscular fibres, which blend in the urethra with the submucous stratum. THE BLADDER. After the bladder has been removed from the pelvis, its form Bladder out and the extent of its different regions can be more conveniently of the body' studied. While the bladder is in the body, it is ovoidal in shape, and form; rather flattened from above down; but out of the body it is rounder than when in its natural position, and it loses that arched form by which it adapts itself in distension to the curve of the pelvis. If this viscus is moderately dilated, it measures about five inches dimensions, in length, and three inches across (Huschke). Its capacity is greatly influenced by the age and habits of the individual. Ordin- arily the bladder holds about a pint without inconvenience during life, though it can contain much more when distended. Structure. A muscular and a mucous coat, with an intervening Coats of the fibrous layer, exist in the wall of the bladder : at certain parts the blaclder- peritoneum may be also enumerated as a constituent of the wall.

Objects inside the bladder. Within the bladder are the following interim- of special parts, viz., the orifices of the ureters and urethra, with the tliebla d<1- triangular surface (fig. 178). Orifices. At the lower part of the bladder is the orifice of the opening of urethra, surrounded by the prostate gland. The mucous membrane m'ethra' presents here some longitudinal folds ; and the aperture is partly closed by a small elongated prominence below, uvula vesicae, occa- witll t]ie sioned by a thickening of the submucous muscular and fibrous uvula, layers. This eminence is placed over the middle lobe of the pro- state ; and from its anterior end a slight ridge is continued on the floor of the urethra. About an inch and a half from the orifice of the urethra, and pl,eilinss oi . i i t . 'he ureters, ratner more than that distance apart, are the two narrow openmgs of the ureters (fig. 178). These tubes perforate the wall of the bladder oblkpiely, lying in it for the distance of three-cpiarters of an inch, so that the reflux of fluid through them towards the kidney is prevented as the bladder is distended. Each terminates by a slit-like opening in a prominence of the subjacent muscular fibres. Triangular surface. Immediately behind the orifice of the urethra Trigone of is a smooth triangular surface, which is named trigone (trigonum the bladdor: vesica}; fig. 178). Its apex reaches the prostate, and its base the ureters. Its boundaries may be marked out by a line on each side how from the urethra to the ureter, and by a transverse one, behind, bounded; between the openings of the ureters. This surface corresponds with part corre- the triangular space externally at the base of the bladder, between externally, the vesiculaa seminales and vasa deferentia. Over it the mucous coat is more closely united to the muscular, so as to prevent the accidental folds occurring in the other parts of the empty bladder. Dissection.

Blood-vessels and nerves. The source of the vesical arteries, and Arteries; the termination of the veins, have been detailed (p. 559). The veins; vessels are disposed in greatest number about the base and neck of the bladder. Most of the nerves distributed to the bladder, though nerves of supplied from the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic (p. 565), are the bladder' derived directly from the spinal nerves. The lymphatics enter the Lymphatics glands by the side of the internal iliac artery.DISSECTION OP THE PELVIS. 572 THE URETHRA AND PENIS. Urethra: extent and length ; division into parts. How to open the urethra. Urethra (fig. 178). The tube of the urethra extends from the neck of the bladder to the end of the penis, and has an average length of about eight inches ; but it is shorter by one inch during life (Thompson). It is supported by the prostate, the triangular ligament, and the spongy structure of the penis. The tube is divided, as before said (p. 550), into a prostatic, a membranous, and a spongy part. Dissection. To open the urethra, let the incision through the prostate be continued onwards to the extremity of the penis along the line of union of the urethral canal with the coqous cavernosum. Prostatic The -prostatic part (fig. 177) is nearer the anterior than the part: posterior surface of the muscular mass surrounding it. It is one dimensions inch and a quarter in length, and is the widest portion of the and urethral canal. Its form is spindle-shaped, for it is larger in the shape; middle than at either end.

In the crest of the mucous mem- in the crest brane, near its posterior extremity, is a small hollow (e) named1S a p vesicula prostatica, sinus pocularis, or utricle. The vesimla prostatica (fig. 177, g) is directed backwards in the Vesieula prostate, for a quarter of an inch, passing beneath the middle and theprostate" between the lateral lobes. Its orifice in the urethra is about a line wide, and its closed extremity is about as large again. Along the and by its wall, on each side, is placed the common seminal duct (J), which ejaculatory terminates on or within the margin of the mouth of the sac ; and if ducts, bristles are introduced into the common seminal duct behind the prostate, they will render the apertures evident. Small glands •open on the surface of the mucous membrane lining the utricle. The vesicula is the remains of the united lower ends of the ducts of Miiller in the foetus, and represents the uterus in the female. On each side of the central crest is an excavation, which is named Prostatic the prostatic sinus (fig. 178, f). Into this hollow the greater number t^Qooi.a S° of the ducts of the prostatic glands open ; but the apertures of some are seen at the back of the central eminence. The MEMBRANOUS PART OF THE URETHRA (fig. 178, g) is three- Membran- quarters of an inch in length, and intervenes between the apex of °us 1,art' "the prostate gland and the bulb (ft) of the corpus spongiosum urethrse. In its interior are slight longitudinal folds. This is the dimensions; narrowest piece of the whole tube, with the exception of the outer orifice, and measures rather less than a quarter of an inch across. It is the weakest of the three portions of the canal, and is supported parts by a thin stratum of erectile tissue, by a thin layer of unstriated around- •circular fibres (p. 429), and outside all by the constrictor urethras muscle. The spongy part (fig. 178, i) reaches to the end of the penis. Spongy It is about six inches in length, and its strength depends upon a pait' surrounding material named corpus spongiosum urethras. The average size of the canal is about a quarter of an inch in dimensions; diameter, though at the vertical slit (meatus urinarius), by which it terminates on the glans penis, the tube is smaller than elsewhere. On a cross section it appears star-shaped, but in the glans, as a vertical slit. Two dilations exist in the spongy portion ;—one is two diiata- along the floor close to the triangular ligament, being contained in irTbnib the bulb or bulbous part of the urethra, and is named sinus of the one in glans; bidb ; the other is an elongated hollow, situate in the glans penis, and has been called fossa navicularis (n). There are many small pouches or lacuna: (o) in the canal, as far lacuna; back as the membranous part, which have their apertures turned towards the outer orifice of the urethra. One of these, larger than 0ne larger the rest, lacuna magna, is found generally immediately within the tnauthe meatus, in the roof of the fossa navicularis. rest' The ducts of Cowper's glands (fig. 178, h) are two in number, Ducts of and terminate, one on each side, on the floor of the urethra near the bulb ; but their openings are generally too small to be recognised.

Beneath the mucous lining of the urethra is a Submucous stratum of longitudinal unstriated muscular fibres, mixed with tissue- elastic and fibrous tissues. It is continuous behind with the sub- mucous fibres of the bladder, and is joined in the prostate by the nature; muscular fibres accompanying the common seminal ducts. The stratum differs at spots :—It is most developed in the prostate ; arrangement in the membranous portion the muscular structure is less abundant; Fig. 179.* and in the spongy part fibrous tissue forms most of the submucous layer. Around the membranous and prostatic divisions of the urethra Erectile there is, in addition, immediately beneath the mucous membrane, a t&Xdtout thm layer of vascular or erectile tissue, which is continued back- wards from the corpus spongiosum to the neck of the bladder. Structure of the Penis. The form and the relations of the Penis penis having been described on p. 551, the bodies of which it is t^vweul r composed remain to be noticed. If a section is made along one erectile0" *' side of the penis, it will show this organ to be composed of two bodie8, masses of spongy and vascular tissue (corpora cavernosa) encased m a fibrous covering, with an imperfect septum between them, and having the corpus spongiosum attached along their under surface.

Fig. ISO.* the penis, and are two dense cylindrical tubes of fibrous tissue, con- taining erectile structure. Each is fixed behind by a pointed process, crus penis, to the conjoined rami of the ischium and pubis for about an inch, and blends with its fellow in the body of the penis, about an inch and a half from its posterior extremity. There is a slight swelling on the crus, called the bidb of the corpus cavernosum (Kobelt). Each corpus cavernosum is composed of a fibrous case containing a cavernous or trabecular structure, with blood-spaces between the trabecular of the spongy mass. An incomplete median septum exists along the body of the penis. The fib 'ous case is a white, strong, elastic covering (fig. 179), from half a line to a line in thickness. Along the middle of the penis a septal process is sent inwards from it; and numerous other finer threads,—the trabecular of the spongy structure, are connected with its inner surface. It is formed of white shining fibres which are disposed in two layers, outer and inner. The outer stratum (fig. 179, b) is formed of longitudinal fibres with close meshes. The inner stratum (fig. 179, a) consists of circular fibres, with a like plexifomi disposition; and the circular fibres of each cavernous body meet- ing in the middle line give rise to the septum penis. Both strata are inseparably miited by communicating bundles. The septal process (fig. 180) is placed ver- tically along the body of the penis, and is thicker and more perfect behind than in front. Near the junction of the crura this partition divides the enclosed cavity into two ; but as it reaches forwards it becomes less strong, and is pierced by elongated apertures, which give it the appearance of a comb, from which the name septum pectiniforme is derived. Through the intervals in the septum the vessels in the corpora cavernosa com- municate. It is formed by the circular fibres of the fibrous case. The cavernous or trabecular structure is a network of fine threads, which fills the interior of the corpora cavernosa. Its processes are thinner towards the centre than at the circumference; and the areolar spaces are larger in the middle and at the fore part of the contained cavity, than at the circumference or in the crura of the penis. The spongy structure may be demonstrated by sections of the penis, after it has been distended with air and dried. Blood-vessels.

Having entered the cavernous mass, they ramify in the trabecular structure. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa are offsets of the pudic ; the Source of^ chief branch (artery of the corpus cavernosum; p. 430) enters at the cms, anil runs forwards through the middle of the cavernous structure, distributing offsets ; and the rest, coming from the dorsal artery (p. 440), pierce the fibrous case along the dorsum of the penis., In the interior they divide into branches, which ramify in the termination trabecule^, becoming finer, until they terminate in very minute spaces, branches, which open into the intertrabecular venous spaces. By the distension of these spaces the erection of the corpora cavernosa is produced. The veins spring from the intertrabecular spaces, and some issue Veins in along the upper and under aspects of the penis to join the dorsaltwo sets- vein; but the principal trunks escape at the cms penis and pass to the pudic veins. Corpus spongiosum urethra. This constituent part of the penis Spongy surrounds the urethra, but not equally on all sides ; for at the bulb J,7the penis: only a thin stratum is above the canal, while at the glans penis (fig. 178, I) the chief mass is placed above the urethral tube. Structure. The tissue of the corpus spongiosum is similar to that its structure of the corpus cavernosum ; thus it consists of a fibrous tunic en- nous?1^' closing a trabecular structure with blood-spaces. The fibrous covering is less dense and strong than in the corpora The fibrous cavernosa, and consists only of circular fibres. A septal piece (fig. case: 176, G) projects inwards from it in the middle line, opposite the tube imperfect of the urethra ; this is best marked for a short distance in front of sePtlim; the bulb, and assists in dividing that part into two lobes. The trabecular bands are much finer, and more uniform in size than in trabecular the corpora cavernosa. Blood-vessels. The arrangement of the blood-vessels hi the erectile Blood- structure of the corpus spongiosum is similar in the bulb to that in veasels: the corpora cavernosa ; but in the rest of the spongy substance the arteries are said to end in capillaries in the usual way. The arteries are derived from the pudic on each side : a large one source of behind, the artery of tlie bulb (p. 430), enters the upper surface 0f arteries; the bulb ; and several in front, offsets of the dorsal artery (p. 440), penetrate the glans. Kobelt describes another branch to the fore part of the bulb. Most of the veins, including those of the glans, end in the large termination dorsal vein of the penis, some communicating with veins of the of the vein8- cavernous body : others issue from the bulb, and terminate in the pudic vein. Nerves and lymphatics. The nerves of the penis are large, and are Nerves, supplied by both the spinal and sympathetic nerves. The superficial lymphatics of the integuments, and those beneath the mucous mem- Lymphatic*, brane of the urethra, join the inguinal glands ; the deep accompany the veins beneath the subpubic arch, to end in the lymphatic glands p p578 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS.

Mucous coat is thick and vascular ; folds in it, some arc permanent; structure. .Arteries: Dissection. The rectum is to be washed out, and then distended with tow ; and the peritoneum and the loose fat are to he removed from it. The lower end of the large intestine, which is contained in the pelvis, is not sacculated like the colon, but is smooth on the surface, the longitudinal bands of the colon being absent from it. It is about eight inches in length; and its average diameter is that of the sigmoid flexure of the colon. Its size is uniform as far as the lower extremity, where it is dilated, particularly in old people ; but the aperture of termination or anus is the smallest part of the gut. Structure. The rectum contains in its wall a peritoneal, a muscular, a submucous, and a mucous stratum ; and the muscular and mucous coats have certain characters which distinguish this part of the intestinal tube. The peritoneum forms but an incomplete covering, and its arrange- ment is referred to in the description of the relations of the pelvic viscera (p. 547). The muscular coat is thick, and consists of two layers of pale or unstriated fibres, viz., a superficial or longitudinal, and a deep or circular. The longitudinal, continuous with those in the bands on the colon, are here diffused to form a stratum round the gut. The cir- cular describe arches around the intestine, and become thicker and stronger towards the anus, where they are collected in the band of the internal sphincter muscle (p. 420). The mucous coat is more moveable than in the colon, and resembles in this respect the lining of the ajsophagus ; it is also thicker and more vascular than in the rest of the large intestine. When the bowel is contracted the mucous lining is thrown into numerous accidental folds ; but some near the anus are longitudinal, enclosing submucous muscular fibres, and form the columns of Morgagni. There are also three permanent folds (Houston) which are half an inch or less in depth, and contain circular fibres of the gut. The most constant of these is about three inches from the anus, on the front of the rectum, opposite the base of the bladder ; another is placed on the right side of the intestine, towards the top ; and the third is on the left side, midway between the other two. These folds will be seen by laying open the gut along the side, provided it is tolerably fresh. The mucous membrane has the same general structure as in the colon, but towards the anus the secretory apparatus gradually dis- appears. Blood-vessels. The arteries are supplied from three different sources, viz., superior hemorrhoidal of the inferior mesenteric, middle htemorrhoidal of the internal iliac, and inferior hemorrhoidal of the internal pudic. All three sets anastomose on the lower end of the gut ; but only the upper hemorrhoidal, which i* the largest, re-579 ANATOMY OP FEMALE VISCERA. quires farther notice. The final branches of this artery (p. 561), "Wg** about six in number, pierce the muscular layer three inches from hsemorrhoi- the anus, and descend between the mucous and muscular coats as dal- far as the internal sphincter, where they unite in loops just within the anus. The veins have no valves, and communicate freely in a large Veins are plexus (hsemorrhoidal) between the muscular and mucous coats, y*ives} round the lower end of the gut. Above, they join the inferior mesenteric vein, and through it reach the vena portse ; and below they pour some blood into the internal iliac vein by the middle and inferior hfemorrhoidal branches. Nerves and lymphatics. The nerves of the intestine are obtained Nerves, from the sympathetic ; but those of the external sphincter come from the spinal nerves. The lymphatics terminate in the chain of Lymphatics, glands on the sacrum. Section VI. ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE PELVIC VISCERA. In the pelvis are contained the viscera alike in both sexes, viz., viscera in the bladder, urethra, and rectum, and those special to the female, the Pelvis- or the organs of generation. Dissection. The contents of the pelvis are to be removed, together to remove with the genital organs. For this purpose the student should keep the visC8ra> the scalpel close to the osseous boundary of the pelvic outlet, to avoid injuring the end of the rectum ; and he should also detach the crus of the clitoris from the bone. After the parts are taken from the body, the rectum is to be and prepare separated from the uterus and the vagina, but the rest of the viscera them' may remain united until after the genital organs are examined. The bladder and rectum may be moderately distended ; and the fat and areolar tissue are to be removed from the viscera. GENITAL ORGANS. The genital organs, or external organs of generat'on, consist of External the following parts :—the mons Veneris and external labia, the ^"ratio clitoris and internal labia, and the vestibule with the meatus urinarius. Within the internal labia is the aperture of the vagina, with the hymen. The name vulva or pudendum is applied to these parts as a whole. Only the clitoris remains to be examined now, the others having been seen in the dissection of the perineum (p. 432) ; but there is also an erectile body on each side of the entrance to the vagina, called the bulb of the vestibule, to be noticed.

The clitoris (fig. 181, b) is a small erectile body, and is the repre- sentative of the penis. It has the same composition as the penis, except that the urethra is not continued along it. Its an tenor extremity is terminated by a rounded part or glans (c), and is covered by a fold of the mucous membrane corresponding to the prepuce of the male (p. 432). In its structure this organ resembles the penis in the following particulars:—It consists of corpora cavernosa, which are attached Fig. 181.* corpora cavernosa, CO) pus spongio- sum, and erectile tissue. Bulbs of vestibule: by crura (one on each side ; a) to the ischio-pubic rami, and are blended in the body. A small suspensory ligament descends to it from the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris; and along the middle is an imperfect pectiniform septum. Farther, it possesses a portion of corpus spongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans clitoridis (c). Structure. The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that in the male organ (p. 576). The blood-vessels of the corpus cavernosum are like those of the penis; and the glans receives the ending of the dorsal artery (p. 440). The bulb OF the vestibdle (semi-bulb, Taylor; fig. 182, a) is an elongated and flattened mass of cavernous or erectile tissue, which is enclosed in a thin fibrous coat. It lies by the side of the vestibule * Representation of the clitoris. a. Cms, and b. Body of the corpus cavernosum c. Gl.ina clitoridis.

The vis- cera are now to be separated, so that the bladder and the urethra may be together, and the vagina and the uterus remain united. The bladder is to clean be set aside for subsequent use. The surface of the vagina and ,agina' the lower part of the uterus should be cleaned ; but the peritoneal investment of the latter is to be left untouched for the present.

Uterus: form; dimensions upper end : the lower end is small, and has an opening; neck ; The uterus or womb is formed chiefly of unstriated muscular fibres. Its office is to receive the ovum, and to contain the developing fetus. This viscus in the virgin state is somewhat pear-shaped, the body being flattened (fig. 183), and the narrow end below. ; Before impregnation the uterus measures about three inches in length, two in breadth at the upper part, and an inch in greatest thickness. Its weight varies from an ounce to an ounce and a half. But after gestation its size and volume always exceed the measure- ments here given. The upper end is convex, and is covered by peritoneum : the name fundus is given to the part of the organ above the attachment of the Fallopian tubes (e). The lower end is small and rounded, and in it is a transverse aperture of communication between the uterus and the vagina, named os uteri (os tineas) : its margins or lips (labia) are smooth, and anterior and posterior in situation, but the hinder one is the longer and thinner. Towards the lower part the uterus is con- stricted ; and the smaller portion is called the neck of the uterus583 ANATOMY OF UTERUS.

The space occupying the body of the viscus (r,) is triangular in is a trian- form, and compressed from before back. Its base is at the fundus, fn t"e body, where it is convex towards the cavity, and the angles are prolonged into the Fallopian tubes. The apex is directed downwards, and joins which is the cavity in the neck by a narrowed circular part, isthmus, which iJekiw^8'1 may be narrower than the opening of the uterus into the vagina. The space within the neck (d) terminates below at the os uteri, and a . spindle- and is continuous above with the cavity within the body. It is shaped larger at the middle than at either end, being spindle-shaped, and is ^g0,^',!}; somewhat flattened like the cavity of the body. Along both the ante- rior and the posterior wall is a longitudinal ridge ; and other ridges (ruga) are directed obliquely from these on each side : this appear- ance has been named arbor vitw uterinus. In the intervals between In the neck the rugae are mucous follicles, which sometimes become distended artordvitaj°f with fluid, and give rise to rounded clear sacs. Structure. The dense wall of the uterus is composed of layers uterus is a of unstriated muscular fibre, intermixed with areolar and elastic "rgan"1^ tissues and large blood-vessels. On the exterior is the peritoneum; and lining the interior is a thin mucous membrane. The muscular fibres can be demonstrated at the full period of There are gestation to form three strata in the wall of the uterus, viz., threostrata: external, internal, and middle :— The external layer contains fibres which are mostly transverse ; external, but at the fundus and sides they are oblique, and are more marked than along the middle of the organ. At the sides the fibres con- verge towards the broad ligament; some are inserted into the sub- peritoneal fibrous tissue ; and others are continued into the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, and the ligament of the ovary.584 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. internal, and middle. Mucous membrane. The internal fibres describe circles round the openings of the Fallopian tubes, and spread from these apertures till they meet at the middle line. At the neck of the uterus they are arranged in a transverse direction. The middle or intervening set of fibres are more indistinct than the others, and have a less determinate direction. The mucous lining of the uterus is continued into the vagina at one end, and into the Fallopian tubes at the other. In the body it is thin and soft, of a reddish-white colour, smooth, and closely Fig. 183.* Vessels are large. Arteries. Veins. Nerves. Lympha- tics : two sets. Round liga- ment ends in groin ; attachment to uterus ; adherent. In the cervix it is stronger, and presents the folds before referred to. The blood-vessels of the uterus are large and tortuous, and occupy canals in the uterine substance, in which they communicate freely together. The arteries are furnished from the uterine and ovarian branches (p. 560). The veins correspond with the arteries ; they are of large size, and form plexuses in the uterus (p. 560). The nerves are derived from the sympathetic (p. 565), and are very small in proportion to the size of the uterus. Lymphatics. One set accompanies the uterine vessels to the glands on the iliac artery. Another set issues from the fundus, enters the broad ligament, and accompanies the ovarian artery to the glands on the aorta : the last are joined by lymphatics of the ovary and Fallopian tube. Round ligament of the uterus (fig. 171, n). This firm cord sup- ports the uterus, and is contained partly in the broad ligament, and partly in the inguinal canal. It is about five inches in length, and is attached to the upper end of the uterus close below and in front of the Fallopian tube.

The ligament is composed of unstriated muscular fibres, derived from the uterus, together with vessels and areolar tissue. OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES. Ovary (fig. 183, h). The ovaries are two bodies, corresponding with the testes of the male. They are contained in the broad liga- ments of the uterus, one in each. Each ovary is of an oval form, and somewhat compressed in one direction. It is of a whitish colour, with either a smooth or a scarred surface. Its volume is variable ; but in the virgin state it is about one inch and a half in length, half as much in width, and a third of an inch in thickness. Its weight varies from one to two drachms. The ovary is placed at the back of the broad ligament, and is attached to that membrane by one margin, where the vessels enter the organ at the hilum. The other margin and both surfaces are free. One end (the upper in the natural position) is rounded, and is connected with one of the fimbriae (</) at the mouth of the Fallo- pian tube. The opposite extremity is narrowed, and is fixed to the side of the uterus by a fibrous cord,—the ligament of the ovary (t), below the level of the Fallopian tube and round ligament. Structure. The ovary consists of a stroma enclosing small sacs named Graafian vesicles, which contain the ova, and the whole is surrounded by a fibrous tunic. The peritoneum invests it except at the attached margin. The fibrous coat is continuous with the contained stroma. Some- times a yellow spot (corpus luteum), or some cicatrices, may be seen in this Fig. 184.* covering. Stroma (fig. 184). The substance of the ovary is spongy, vascular, and fibrous. At the centre the fibres radiate from the hilum towards the circumference. But at the exterior is a granular material (cortical layer) which contains very many small fol- licles, about y^gth of an inch in size —the nascent Graafian vesicles. The Graafian vesicles or ovisacs (fig. 184) are round and transparent sacs, containing fluid, and scattered through the stroma of the ovary below the cortical layer. During the child-bearing period some are larger than the rest (a); and of this larger set ten to thirty, * Ovary during the child-bearing period laid open. a.

The largest are situate at the circum- ference of the organ, and sometimes they may be seen projecting through the fibrous coat. When the Graafian vesicle is matured it bursts on the surface of the ovary, and the contained ovum escapes into the Fallopian tube. After the shedding of the ovum the ruptured vesicle gives origin to a yellow substance, corpus luteum, which finally changes into a cicatrix (b). Blood-vessels and nerves. The ovarian artery pierces the ovary at the attached border, and its branches run in zigzag lines through the stroma, to which and the Graafian vesicles they are distributed. The veins begin in the texture of the ovary, and after escaping from its substance, form a plexus (pampiniform) within the fold of the broad ligament. The nerves are derived from the sympathetic on the ovarian and uterine vessels. Appendage to ovary: situation; form ; structure. Parovarium or organ of Rosenmuller (epoophoron of Waldeyer; fig. 183, k). On holding up the broad ligament of the uterus to the light, a collection of small tortuous tubules will be seen between the ovary and the Fallopian tube. These are the remains of the upper part of the Wolffian body of the foetus, and correspond to the vasa efferentia of the testicle in the male. The mass is about one inch broad, with its base to the Fallopian tube, and apex to the attached border of the ovary. The small tubes are from twelve to twenty in number ; at the wider end they are joined more or less perfectly by a tube crossing the rest (the remnant of the Wolffian duct), which is prolonged some- times a short way into the broad ligament. Fallopian tube: length; ;ii nl form; it is dilated externally, and fimbri- ated ; size of the canal is least at the ends. A muscular structure: librcs pro- longed from uterus. Fallopian Tubes (fig. 183, e). Two in number, one on each side, they convey the ova from the ovaries to the uterus. Each is about four inches in length : cord-like at the inner end, where it is attached to the upper part of the uterus, it increases in size towards the outer end, and terminates in a wide extremity (/), like the mouth of a trumpet. This dilated end is fringed, and the pieces are called fimbria. When the fimbriated end is floated out in water, one of the processes (the ovarian fimbria ; g) may be seen to be fixed to the distal end of the ovaiy. In the centre of the fimbriae is a groove leading to the orifice of the Fallopian tube. On opening the tube with care, the size of the contained space and its small aperture into the uterus can be observed. Its canal varies in size at different spots ;—the narrowest part is at the orifice into the uterus (ostium uterinum), where it scarcely gives passage to a fine bristle ; towards the outer end it increases a little, but it is rather diminished in diameter at the outer aperture (ostium abdominale). Structure. This tube has the same structure as the uterus with which it is connected, viz., a muscular layer covered externally by peritoneum, and lined by mucous membrane. The muscular coat is formed of an external or longitudinal, and an internal or circular layer; both these are continuous with similar strata in the wall of the uterus.587 BLADDER AND URETHRA IN FEMALE. The mucous membrane forms some longitudinal folds, particularly "u°ous at the outer end.

In consequence of not being surrounded by resistant ^ can be structures, the female urethra is much more dilatable than the 5™°n, ,. , . dilated, correspondmg passage m the male. Structure.

Its Muscular fibres are circular, corresponding with those in the prostatic en- cufar°flbre"s. largement of the other sex, and continuous above with the middle layer of the bladder.

Pyrifonuis origin in the pelvis; insertion; relations with parts around: use as an external rotator of hip-joint. Obturator internus is lient over pelvis; origin in the pelvis; arching of its tendons over the hip bone; Two muscles, the pyriformis and obturator internus, have their origin within the cavity of the pelvis. Dissection. Take away any fascia or areolar tissue which may remain on the muscles ; and define their exit from the pelvis,—the pyriformis passing through the great, and the obturator through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. On the right side the dissector may look to the attachment of the levator ani muscle to the pubic part of the hip-bone. Tbe pyriformis muscle is directed outwards through the great sacro-sciatic foramen to the great trochanter of the femur. The muscle has received its name from its form. In the pelvis the pyriformis arises by three slips from the second, third, and fourth pieces of the sacrum, between the anterior aper- tures, and from the surface of the bone external to those holes ; as it passes from the pelvis, it takes origin also from the surface of the hip-bone forming the upper boundary of the large sciatic notch, and from the great sacro-sciatic ligament. From this origin the fibres converge to the tendon of insertion into the trochanter (p. 638). The anterior surface is in contact with the sacral plexus, with the sciatic and pudic branches of the internal iliac vessels, and with the rectum on the left side. The opposite surface rests on the sacrum, and is covered by the great gluteal muscle outside the pelvis. The upper border is near the hip-bone, the gluteal vessels and the supe- rior gluteal nerve being between; and the lower border is contiguous to the coccygeus muscle, the sciatic and pudic vessels and nerves intervening. Action. The pyrifonuis belongs to the group of external rotators of the hip-joint; and its use will be given with the description of the rest of the muscle in the dissection of the buttock (p. 638). The obturator internus muscle has its origin in the pelvis, and insertion at the great trochanter of the femur, like the preced- ing ; but the part outside forms an acute angle with that inside the pelvis. The muscle arises by a broad fleshy attachment from the obtura- tor membrane, except a small part below; from the pelvic fascia covering its surface ; slightly from the bone anterior to the thyroid hole, but from all the smooth inclined surface of the pelvis behind and above that aperture, except opposite the small .sacro-sciatic foramen, where a thin layer of fat separates tlie fleshy fibres from the bone. The fibres are directed backwards and downwards, and end in four or five tendinous pieces, which turn over the edge of the hip-bone corresponding with the small sciatic notch.

The following are the articulations between the bones of the pel- 9l,tli1? of ° , . « ., , , . , the articu- vis :—The several pieces oi the sacrum and coccyx are united with lations. one another. The sacrum is joined at its base to the last lumbar vertebra, at its apex to the coccyx, and laterally to the two hip- bones. And the hip-bones are connected together in front, as well as to the spinal column behind. Union op Pieces op Sacrum and Coccyx. So long as the pieces Ligaments of the sacrum aud coccyx remain moveable they are articulated as separate,' in the other vertebrae by an anterior and posterior common ligament, with an intervertebral disc for the bodies ; and by other ligaments for the neural arch and processes (p. 374). After the sacral vertebras have coalesced, only rudiments of the a,ld j°med- ligaments of the bodies are to be recognised ; and when the pieces of the coccyx unite by bone, their ligaments disappear. Sacro-Vertebral Articulation. The base of the sacrum is Sacrum articulated with the last lumbar vertebra by ligaments similar to lumbar8* those uniting one vertebra to another (p. 374); and by one special vertebra, ligament—the sacro-vertebral. Dissection. For the best manner of bringing these different liga- Dissection, nients into view, the dissector may consult the directions given for the dissection of the ligaments of the vertebras (p. 374). The common ligaments for the bodies of the two bones are an By liga- anterior and a posterior, with an intervening fibro-cartilaginous fue"]^ ^r substance. Between the neural arches lie the ligamenta subflava ; tebrse, and between the spines the supra- and interspinous bands are situate. The articular processes are united by capsular ligaments with syno- vial membranes. The sacro-vertebral ligament is a variable bundle of fibres, which am' by a reaches from the under surface of the tip of the transverse process bamlfsacro- of the last lumbar vertebra to the lateral mass at the base of the vertebral, sacrum.

The anterior ligament (sacro-coccygeal) consists of a few fibres that pass between the bones in front of the fibro-cartilage. The posterior ligament is wide at its attachment to the margin of the lower opening of the sacral canal, but narrows as it descends to be inserted into the coccyx. The fibro-cartilage resembles that between the bodies of the other vertebrae, and is attached to the surfaces of the bones. Inter articular ligaments. The cornua of the sacrum and coccyx do not usually form joints, but are united by a ligamentous band on each side. The lateral ligament passes on each side between the projections representing the transverse processes of the last sacral and first coccygeal vertebras. Movement. While the coccyx remains unossified to the sacrum, a slight antero-posterior movement will take place between them. Sacro-Iliac Articulation. The irregular surfaces by which the sacrum and the hip-bone articulate are covered with cartilage, and are maintained in contact by anterior and posterior sacro-iliac ligaments. Inferioily the bones are farther connected, without being in contact, by the strong sacro-sciatic ligaments. Dissection. To see the posterior ligaments, the mass of muscle at the back of the sacrum is to be removed on the side on which the hip-bone remains. The thin anterior bands will be visible on the removal of some areolar tissue. The small sacro-sciatic ligament will be brought into view by removing the fleshy fibres of the coccygeus ; and the large ligament is dissected with the lower limb. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of a few thin scattered fibres between the bones, near their articular surfaces. The posterior sacro-iliac ligament is very strong, and consists of bundles of fibres which pass obliquely from the rough part of the inner side of the ilium above the auricular surface to the depressions on the back of the first and second pieces of the sacrum. A distinct band, longer and more superficial than the rest, runs from the posterior superior iliac spine to the third and fourth pieces of the sacrum : this is named the long posterior ligament. Articular cartilage. This may be seen after the sacro-sciatic and ilio-lumbar ligaments have been examined, by opening the articula- tion and separating the bones. It covers the auricular surfaces of both sacrum and ilium, but is much thicker on the sacrum. Its surface is generally uneven ; and the intermediate cleft is sometimes partly interrupted by transverse fibres uniting the two layers. Mechanism. Theie is scarcely any appreciable movement in this articulation, owing to the tightness with which the two bones are bound together by ligaments, and the irregular form of the articular surfaces, which are consequently unable to glide over one another. In the erect posture the sacrum is suspended between the two hip- bones by the thick posterior sacro-iliac ligaments, and the upper arch of the pelvis is thereby rendered less rigid than would be the591 SACRO-SCIATIC LIGAMENTS. and small: case if it were formed of continuous bone. The sacro-iliac articula- tion thus serves to give elasticity to the pelvis, and to diminish the effect of shocks passing to the spine. Two sacro-sciatic ligaments pass from the side of the sacrum sacro-sciatic and coccyx to the hinder border of the hip-bone, across the space a\f"t"vo -.S between those bones at the back of the pelvis : they are named great and small. The great or posterior ligament (fig. 185, a) is attached above to large, the posterior inferior iliac spine, and to the side of the sacrum and coccyx ; and below to the inner margin of the ischial tu- berosity, sending forwards a prolongation (falciform process) along the ramus of the ischium. It is wide at the sacrum, and gets narrower towards the lower end ; but it is somewhat ex- panded again at the tuberosity. The relations of this band are seen in the dissection of the buttock (p. 644). The small or anterior ligament (fig. 185, b) is attached in- ternally by a wide piece to the border of the sacrum and coccyx, where it is united with the origin of the preceding band. The fibres are directed outwards, and are inserted as a narrow band into the ischial spine of the hip-bone. Its deep surface is blended with the coccygeus ; and it may be looked upon as being a fibrous portion of that muscle. Above it is the large sacro-sciatic foramen ; and below it is the small foramen of the same name, which is bounded by the two ligaments. By their position these ligaments convert into two foramina (sacro- apertures sciatic) the large sacro-sciatic excavation in the dried bones : the openings, and the things they give passage to, are described with the buttock (p. 644). Use. The sacro-sciatic ligaments, by holding down the lower part use. of the sacrum, serve to prevent that bone from rotating at the sacro- iliac articulation, under the influence of the weight pressing on its upper end in the erect position. The iliolumbar ligament is a strong triangular band, which nio-lumbar springs by its narrow end from the extremity of the transverse pro- ligam,'llt: cess of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Directed outwards and somewhat backwards, it spreads out to be inserted into the iliac crest for about an inch, opposite the back part of the iliac fossa.

This ligament supports the upright moveable portion of the spinal column, and resists the tendency of the last lumbar vertebra to slip forwards over the inclined base of the sacrum. Pubic Articulation (symphysis pubis; fig. 186, a). The two pubic bones are united by an interpubic disc, by ligamentous fibres in front and above, and by a strong subpubic ligament. The anterior pubic ligament is composed of interlacing fibres Fig. 186.* which are mixed with fibres of the tendon of the external oblique muscle. There is not any definite posterior band ; but the periosteum is thickened by a few scattered fibres. The superior ligamentous fibres fill the interval between the bones above the disc. The subpubic ligament (ligamentum arcuatum; fig. 186, d) is a strong triangvdar band occupying the angular interval between the pubic rami at the lower part of the symphysis. Its apex is con- tinuous with the fibrous portion of the interpubic disc ; its base is free and concave, and forms the summit of the subpubic arch. * Ligaments of the symphysis pubis, thyroid hole, and acetabulum, a.

The fibrous part is thickest in front; and at the upper and back portion of the symphysis there is cleft in it. generally a fissure, produced by the absorption of the fibrous sub- stance.

Position. During the dissection of the front of the thigh the body lies on the back, with the buttocks resting on the edge of the table, and with a block of suitable size beneath the loins. The lower limb should be supported in a half-bent position by a stool beneath the foot, and should be rotated outwards to make evident a hollow at the top of the thigh. Surface-marking. Before any of the integument is removed from the limb, the student is to observe the chief eminences and hollows on the surface of the thigh. The limit between the thigh and abdomen is marked, in front, by the firm band of Poupart's ligament reaching from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the pubis. On the outer side, tin- separation is indicated by the convexity of the iliac crest of the hip- bone, which subsides behind in the sacrum and coccyx. Internally is the projection of the pubis, from which the bony margin of the subpubic arch may be traced backwards, forming the inner boundary of the limb, to the ischial tuberosity. On the anterior aspect of the thigh, and close to Poupart's liga- ment, is a slight hollow, corresponding with the triangular space >>i Scarpa, in which the larger vessels of the limb are contained ; and extending thence oblicruely towards the inner side of the limb, is a slight depression marking the situation of the femoral artery beneath. The position of the arterial trunk may be ascertained by a line from the centre of the interval between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine to the inner condyle of the femur. At the outer side of the hip, from three to four inches below and behind the anterior part of the iliac crest, the well-marked projec- tion of the great trochanter of the femur will be recognised. In a thin body the head of the femur may be felt by rotating the limb inwards and outwards, while the thumb of one hand is placed in the hollow below Poupart's ligament, or the fingers behind lhe great trochanter.599 ANATOMY OF SUPERFICIAL PARTS. At the knee the outline of the several bones entering into the Bony formation of the joint may be traced with ease. In front of the of kMoe:'" joint, when it is half-bent, the rounded prominent patella may be patella; perceived ; this bone is firmly fixed while the limb is kept in the bent position, bat is moved with great freedom when the joint is extended, so as to relax the muscles inserted into it. On each side condyles of the patella is the projection of the condyle of the femur, but °efmu?; that on the inner side is the larger. If the fingers are passed along the sides of the patella while the joint is half bent, they will be conducted to the tuberosities of the head of the tibia, and to a tuberosities slight hollow between it and the femur. of thL tibia" Behind the joint is a slight depression over the situation of the ham The liam or popliteal space ; and on its sides are firm boundaries, which are benin(l- formed by the tendons (hamstrings) of the flexor muscles of the knee. Dissection. With the limb placed as before directed, the student Dissection, begins the dissection with the examination of the subcutaneous fatty tissue with its nerves and vessels. At first the integument is to be reflected only from the hollow on Take the front of the thigh close below Poupart's ligament. To raise the top of tin- skin over it, an incision about four inches in length, and only skin thlK1>- deep, is to be made from the pubis along the inner border of the thigh. At the lower end of the first incision, another cut is to be directed outwards across the front of the limb to the outer aspect ; and at the upper end the knife is to be carried along the line of Poupart's ligament as far as the crest of the ilium. The piece of skin included by these incisions is to be raised and turned outwards, without taking with it the subcutaneous fat. The subcutaneous fatty tissue, or the superficial fascia, forms a Superficial general investment for the limb, and is constructed of a network faseia: of areolar tissue, with fat or adipose substance amongst the meshes, how As a part of the common covering of the body, it is continuous forme<1; with that of the neighbouring regions ; consecpaently it may be followed inwards to the scrotum or the labium according to the sex, and upwards on the abdomen. Its thickness varies in different thickness bodies, according to the quantity of fat in it; and when well de- vari8S- veloped it may be divided into separate layers. Its relations will be made more evident by the following dissection. Dissection. To reflect the superficial fascia, incisions similar to To raise fcuo those made in the skin are to be employed ; and the separation from j^f80'^ the subjacent structures is to be begun below, where the large saphenous vein, and a condensed or membranous appearance on the under surface, will mark the depth of the stratum. The layer of fat may be thrown outwards readily by a few touches of the knife, when the superficial vessels and inguinal lymphatic glands will come into view. The subcutaneous layer decreases in thickness, and becomes more Relations of fibrous near Poupaft's ligament; and at its under aspect it has a smooth and membranous surface. It conceals the superficial vessels and the inguinal glands,' and is separated by these from Poupart's ligament.coo DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. Dissection Dissection (fig. 187). Tbe inguinal glands and the superficial vessels are to be next cleaned by the removal of any surrounding fat; but the student is to be careful not to destroy a deeper, very thin layer of areolar tissue which is beneath them, and is visible on the inner side of the centre of the limb. Three sets of vessels are to see the to be dissected out :—One set (artery and vein) is directed inwards vessels?1111 to tlie Pu0es> m& is named external pudic ; another, superficial epigastric, ascends over Poupart's ligament; and the third, the superficial circumflex iliac, appears at the outer part of the limb.

C01 A small nerve, the ilio-inguinal, is to be sought on the inner side and nerves, of the saphenous vein, close to the pubis; and a branch of the genito-crural nerve may be found a little outside the vein. Superficial Vessels. The small cutaneous arteries at the top The arteries of the thigh are the first branches of the femoral trunk, they pierce f^oIaLe the deep fascia (fascia lata), and are distributed to the integuments and the glands of the groin and neighbourhood. The external pcdic artery (superior; fig. 187, b) crosses the one external spermatic cord in its course inwards, and ends in the integuments of P^r°. the penis and scrotum, where it anastomoses with offsets of the in- ternal pudic artery. Another external pudic branch (inferior ; p. 612) pierces the fascia another lata at the inner border of the thigh, and ramifies also in the t^e fasciu. scrotum. In the female both branches supply the labium pudendi. The superficial epigastric artery (c) passes over Poupart's superficial ligament to the abdomen (p. 438), and communicates with branches epigastric, of the deep epigastric arteiy. The SUPERFICIAL CIRCUMFLEX ILIAC ARTERY (d) is the smallest of Superficial the three branches : appearing as two or more pieces at the upper fi^c"" pai't of the thigh near the iliac crest, it ia distributed in the integu- ments : it supplies an offset with the external cutaneous nerve. A vein accompanies each artery, having the same name as its com- Veins join panion vessel, and ends in the upper part of the saphenous vein, nous.*1* 6" with the exception of that with the inferior pudic artery : these veins will be noticed subsequently (p. 602). The superficial inguinal glands (e) are arranged in two lines, inguinal One set lies across the thigh, near Poupart's ligament; and the two sets, other is situate along the side of the saphenous vein. In the lower or femoral group the glands are larger than in the upper, and the lymphatic vessels from the surface of the lower limb enter them, which The upper or abdominal group is joined by the lymphatics of the ^5^% penis, by those of the surface of the abdomen, and by those of the lymphatics, buttock. The glands vary much in number and size ; and not unfrequently some of the longitudinal set by the side of the vein are blended together. Cribriform fascia. Beneath, and to the inner side of, the internal Cribriform saphenous vein there is a thin layer of areolar tissue on the surface lascia ls of the fascia lata, which is sometimes described as a special deeper layer of the superficial fascia. This stratum is continued across the an areolar aperture in the deep fascia (saphenous opening ; fig. 187, /) through n,e™bRim= which the vein disappears ; and being there perforated by many saphenous large lymphatic vessels, as well as by the saphenous vein, the name openin- : cribriform fascia has been given to this part. The cribriform fascia is closely united to the outer margin of the saphenous opening ; and it is also adherent to the subjacent crural sheath of the vessels in the aperture. In a hernial protrusion through the saphenous open- relation to ing, the cribriform fascia is stretched and pushed forwards by the femoral tumour, and forms one of the coverings. hernia. Dissection. Now the student has observed the disposition of the Dissection superficial fascia near Poupart's ligament, he may proceed to e\- of tlie front A of the thigh.002 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. Take awiiy the skin, and follow saphenous vein. Seek cutane- ous nerves of front of thigh, Internal saphenous vein in thigh amine the remainder of the subcutaneous covering of the thigh, together with the vessels and nerves in it. To raise the skin from the front of the thigh, a cut is to be cairied along the centre of the limb, over the knee-joint, to rather below the tubercle of the tibia. At the extremity of this a trans- verse incision is to be made across the front of the leg, but this is to reach farthest on the inner side. The skin may be reflected in Haps inwards and outwards'; and as it is raised from the front *of the knee, a superficial bursa between it and the patella will be opened. The saphenous vein is to be first traced out in the fat as far as the skin is reflected, but in removing the tissue from it the student should be careful of branches of the internal cutaneous nerve. The cutaneous neives of the front of the thigh (fig. 188) are to be sought in the fat, with small cutaneous arteries, in the following positions :—On the outer margin, below the upper third, is placed the external cutaneous nerve. In the middle of the limb, below the upper third, lie the two branches of the middle cutaneous nerve. At the inner margin are the ramifications of the internal cutaneous nerve,—one small offset appearing near the upper part of the thigh, one or more about half-way down, and one of the terminal 1 tranches (anterior) about the lower third. On the inner side of the knee three other cutaneous nerves are to be looked for :—One, a branch of the great saphenous, is directed outwards over the patella. Another, the trunk of the great saphe- nous nerve, lies by the side of the vein of the same name, close to the lower edge of the surface now dissected. And the third is a terminal branch (posterior) of the internal cutaneous nerve, which is close behind the preceding, and communicates with it. Vessels. All the cutaneous veins on the anterior and inner as- pects of the thigh are collected into one ; and this trunk is named saphenous from its manifest appearance on the surface. The internal saphenous vein (fig. 187, a) is the cutaneous trunk of the inner side of the lower limb, and extends from the foot to the top of the thigh. In the part of its course now dis- sected, the vessel lies inferiorly somewhat behind the knee-joint; but as it ascends to its termination, it is directed along the inner side and the front of the thigh. Near Poupart's ligament it pierces the fascia lata by a special opening named saphenous, and enters the deep vein (femoral) of the limb. Superficial branches join it both externally and internally ; and near Poupart's ligament the three veins corresponding with the arteries in that situation, viz., external pudic (6), superficial epigas- tric (c), and circumflex iliac (d), terminate in it. . Towards the upper part of the limb the veins of the inner side and back of the thigh are frequently united into one branch, which enters the saphenous trunk near the aperture in the fascia lata ; and some- times those on the outer side of the thigh are collected together in a similar way. When this arrangement exists three large veins will be present on the front of the thigh, near the saphenous opening.CUTANEOUS NEEVES. 603 Fig. 188.* On the side of the knee the vein receives a communicating branch from the deep veins. Some unnamed cutaneous arteries are distributed to the integu- ments along with the nerves ; and the superficial branch of the anastomotic artery (p. 618) accompanies the saphenous nerve and its branches near the knee. Nerves. The cutaneous nerves of the thigh are derived from branches of the lumbar plexus, and in greater number on the inner than the outer side. Ilio-inguinal. This nerve (p. 536) is small, and reaches the surface by passing through the external abdominal ring (fig. 187,1) ; it supplies the scrotum, and ends cn the adjacent part of the thigh, internal to the saphenous vein. Genito-crural. The crural branch of this nerve (p. 536) pierces the fascia lata near Poupart's ligament (fig. 188,6), rather ex- ternal to the line of the femoral artery. After or before the nerve has become su- perficial it communicates with the middle cutaneous nerve ; and it extends on the an- terior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the knee and the pelvis. Occasionally this branch is of large size, and takes the place of the external cuta- neous nerve on the outer side of the limb. The external cutaneous nerve (p. 536) ramifies on the outer aspect of the limb (fig. 188,'). At first it is contained in a prominent ridge of the fascia lata on the outer margin of the thigh, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch subdivides into two or three others, wdiich arch backwards to supply the integuments of the outer side of the thigh as low as the middle. The anterior branch appears on the fascia lata about four inches from Poupart's liga- ment and is continued to the knee below the other ; it distributes branches laterally, but those towards the posterior surface are more numerous, and larger. Middle cutaneous (fig. 188,2). The nerve of the centre of the is a cutaneous offset of the anterior crural (p. 622), and divides into two branches.

Derived from the anterior crural trunk, this nerve is furnished to the inner side of the thigh and leg. It is divided into two branches (anterior and posterior) which perforate the fascia at separate places. The anterior branch becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the thigh, in the line of the inner intermuscular septum (fig. 188, a), along which it is continued to the knee. This branch is distributed in the lower third of the thigh, as well as over the patella and tin- inner side of the knee-joint, and is united with the patellar branch of the internal saphenous nerve. The posterior branch (fig. 203,8) perforates the fascia on the inner side of the knee, behind the internal saphenous nerve, with which it communicates ; it furnishes offsets to the upper half of the leg, on the inner surface. Other small offsets of the nerve supply the inner side of the thigh, and appear by the side of the saphenous vein. One or two come into view near the top of the vein, and reach as far as the middle of the thigh ; and one, larger than the rest, becomes cutaneous- where the others cease, and extends as far as the knee. The internal saphenous nerve (fig. 188,'), a branch of the anterior crural, is continued to the foot, but only a small part of it is now visible. It pierces the fascia close below the knee on the inner side ; and after communicating with the inner branch of the internal cutaneous, gives forwards some offsets over the head of the tibia. Finally, it accompanies the saphenous vein to the leg and foot. Its patellar branch (fig. 188,5) appears on the inner side of the knee above the preceding, and is soon joined by the internal cuta- neous nerve. It ends in many branches over the patella; these communicate with offsets from the middle and internal cutaneous nerves, and form a network (patellar plexus) over the joint. Dissection. Let the fat and the inguinal glands be now removed from the surface of the fascia lata, the cutaneous nerves being thrown aside to be traced afterwards to their trunks. At the upper part of the thigh the cribriform fascia is to be re- moved with great care so as to show the saphenous opening, without injury to the subjacent crural sheath ; and on the outer side of the aperture a semilunar border is to be defined by dividing the fibrous bands that unite it to the front of the sheath. The fascia lata is the deep aponeurosis of the thigh. It is of a bluish-white colour, and surrounds the limb with a firm sheath ; but in fat bodies it is sometimes so slight as to be taken away with the subcutaneous fat. It is strongest on the outer aspect of the limb, where it receives the insertion of the tensor vaginae femoris, and most of the gluteus maximus muscle. This thickened part (ilio-tibial band) is attached above to the hip-bone, and below to the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and helps to keep the knee-joint straight in standing.605 THE FASCIA LATA. Numerous apertures exist in the fascia for the transmission of the A1'^^8 cutaneous nerves and vessels ; and the largest hole is near Poupart's ligament, to permit the passage of the internal saphenous vein. Processes prolonged from the deep surface form septa between, ^yg88"8],,, and fibrous sheaths around, the several muscles. Two of the pro- muscles, cesses are larger than the rest, and are named outer and inner inter- muscular septa of the thigh: they are fixed to the femur, so as to limit on the sides the extensor of the knee. The position of these partitions is marked by white lines on the surface. At the'top of the thigh the fascia is fixed to the prominent borders Connected of the pelvis. Thus, it is connected externally with the iliac crest, at upper and internally with the body of the pubis and the margin of the pubic arch. Behind, it is joined to the lower end of the sacrum and coccyx ; and in front, to Poupart's ligament between the pubis and the iliac crest. Behind the knee-joint the fascia passes un- interruptedly to the leg ; but in front of the articulation it blends j^r?"^t!lt with an expansion from the extensor muscle, and is continued over the joint and the patella, though separated from that bone by a bursa, to be inserted into the heads of the tibia and fibula. On each side of the patella is a band of almost transverse fibres ij^jesof" (retinaculum), which is attached to and supports the knee-cap. patella, The outer, thick and strong, is continuous externally with the ilio- strong, tibial band, and joins the insertion of the vastus externus at its attachment to the patella : it guides the patella outwards when the joint is bent. The inner band, of slight strength, is fixed to the inner patella lower than the other, and unites with the insertion of the weak- inner vastus. Directions. The flaps of skin which were removed from the front Replace of the thigh, to follow the cutaneous vessels and nerves, are to be aaPsofskin- now stitched together to keep moist the subjacent parts;, and the saphenous opening is to be learnt. The saphenous opening in the fascia lata (fig. 187,/) is an oval Saphenous aperture, which is situate rather internal to the middle line of the T"*"8 = thigh. It measures about half an inch in width, and one inch and and3 '0a' a half m length. Its upper extremity (superior cornu) is atsize; Poupart's ligament; and its lower extremity (inferior cornu) is distant from that structure about one inch and a half, and presents (when dissected) a well-defined margin. Internally, the saphenous opening has not any distinct margin, for no defined the membrane here (called the pubic portion of the fascia lata) is Ssidc; continued outwards over the subjacent muscle (pectineus), and behind the femoral vessels, to form the back of the crural sheath. Externally, the fascia lata (iliac part) forms a semilunar border, on outer when detached, the concavity of which is turned downwards and t^oxm inwards. This edge is named from its shape falciform margin of the Innrgin. saphenous opening (falciform process of Burns) ; it is superficial to the femoral vessels, and is connected by fibrous bands to the crural sheath, and to the cribriform fascia. Traced upwards, the outer which joins edge blends with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (part of Poupart's nfe™*'8606 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. and forms femoral ligament; tenseness of the margin varies. Parts transmitted through the opening. ligament) : the upper end of this border, where it is internal to the subjacent femoral vein, has been named the femoral ligament. The rigidity of the margin of the opening is much influenced by the position of the limb ; for with the finger beneath the upper part of the falciform border, while the thigh is moved in different directions, this band will be perceived to be most unyielding when the limb is extended and rotated out, and most relaxed when the thigh is bent and turned in the opposite direction. Through the lower cornu of the opening the saphenous vein is transmitted; and through the upper part, close to the falciform edge, a femoral hernia projects. Lymphatics and one or two superficial arteries also pass through it. PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. Anatomy of femoral hernia. Dissection for femoral sheath. Deline sheath. Crural arch : attach- ments ; form : parts closing hollow beneath. To understand the anatomy of a hernial protrusion in the thigh, the dissector has to study the undermentioned parts, viz., the crural arch and Gimbernat's ligament, the crural sheath with its crural canal and ling, together with a partition (septum crurale) between the thigh and the abdomen. Dissection (fig. 189). To examine Poupart's ligament and the membranous sheath round the femoral vessels, the piece of the fascia lata outside the saphenous opening is to be reflected inwards by the following incisions :—One cut is to be begun near the upper end of the falciform border, and to be carried outwards for one inch and a half, parallel and close to Poupart's ligament. Another is to be directed obliquely downwards and inwards from the termination of the first, to a little below the inferior cornu of the opening. When the fascia marked out by those incisions has been raised and turned inwards, and the fat removed, the tube on the vessels (crural sheath) will be brought into view as it descends beneath Poupart's ligament. With the handle of the scalpel the crural sheath is to be separated carefully from Poupart's ligament in front, and from Gimbernat's ligament on the inner side. Poupart's ligament or the crural arch (fig. 189, c) is the firm band of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, which stretches from the front of the iliac crest to the pubis (p. 443). When viewed on the surface the arch is curved down- wards towards the limb, so long as the fascia lata remains on the thigh. The outer half is oblique. But the inner half is almost horizontal, and widens as it approaches the pubis, where it is in- serted into the pubic spine and pectineal line of the hip-bone, forming Gimbernat's ligament. The space between the crural arch and the hip-bone is larger in the female than in the male, and is closed by parts passing from the abdomen to the thigh. The outer Ijalf of the interval is filled by the psoas and iliacus muscles, between which is the anterior crural nerve, while the external cutaneous nerve lies on the iliacus m ar theANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 607 anterior superior iliac spine : in this part Poapart's ligament is closely bound down to the muscle by its attachment to the iliac fascial The inner half is occupied by the femoral vessels and their sheath, with the upper end of the pectineus muscle; the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve issues on the outer side of the artery. Gimbernat's ligament, or the piece of the tendon of the external ,([™nt^J.'Itiat's oblique muscle which is inserted into the pectineal line, is about 1 three-fourths of an inch in length, and is triangular in shape.

By one margin (anterior) it is continuous with the crural arch, and by the opposite it is fixed to the pectineal line. In the erect position of the body the ligament is almost horizontal. The crural sheath (fig. 189, b) is a loose tube of membrane Crural around the femoral vessels. It has the form of a funnel, sloped un-she!ltl1 • equally on the sides. The wide part of the tube is upwards ; and B the narrow part ceases about two inches below Poupart's ligament, relations; by blending with the common areolar sheath of the blood-vessels. Its outer border is nearly straight, and is perforated by the genito- crural nerve ('). Its inner border is oblique, and is pierced by Lymphatics, superficial vessels, and the saphenous vein (/); this part of the sheath appears in the saphenous opening, and is con- nected to the falciform margin and the cribriform fascia. In front of the crural sheath is the iliac part of the fascia lata. The sheath is continuous with the fasciae of the abdomen and how formed, thigh in this way;—the anterior part is a prolongation of the transve.rsalis fascia beneath Poupart's ligament; and the posterior part is formed externally by the iliac fascia covering the psoas muscle, and internally by the pubic part of the fascia lata covering the pectineus. Crossing the front of the sheath, beneath the arch of Poupart's Deep crural ligament, is a fibrous band, the deep crural arch: It is noticed in are'1- the description of the transversalis fascia (p. 452).

The winding course of the hernia may suggest to the dissector How it is the direction in which attempts should be made to replace the in- taok.PUSlied testine in the abdominal cavity. With the view of making the bowel retrace its course, it will be necessary, if the protrusion is small, to direct it backwards and upwards ; but if the hernia is large, it must be pressed down first to the saphenous opening, and after- wards backwards and upwards towards the crural canal and ring. During the manipulation to return the intestine to its cavity, the thigh is to be raised and rotated inwards, in order that the margin of the saphenous opening and the other structures may be relaxed. Coverings. As the intestine protrudes it is clothed by the follow- Coverings ing layers, which are elongated and pushed before it from within toneum"" outwards. First is a covering of the peritoneum lining the abdomen, crural s'ep- which forms the hernial sac. Next one from the septum crurale g^'t"ural across the crural ring.

Farther, in an1.old hernia the covering derived from the septum crurale is united usually with that from the crural sheath, so as to form one layer, the fascia propria (Cooper). In general, in an operation for the relief of the strangulated bowel, the surgeon, after dividing the subcutaneous fat, can recognise but little of the coverings enume- rated by anatomists until he meets with that of the subperitoneal fat or septum crurale. R R610 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. Tumour, how known, Place of stricture. How to cut the external and the internal stricture. Diagnosis. This hernial tumour is generally smaller than inguinal, and does not extend into the scrotum in the male, or the labium in the female ; and if its neck can be traced below Poupart's liga- ment, it can be distinguished certainly from an inguinal hernia. Seat of stricture and division of it. The strangulation of a femoral hernia may be situate either outside or inside the neck of the sac. The external stricture may be found opposite the margin of the saphenous opening, or deeper in, opposite Poupart's ligament. It may be removed by cutting down on the neck of the tumour at the inner side, and dividing the constricting band arching over the neck of the hernia in this situation, without opening the sac. The stricture inside the neck of the sac is occasioned by the thick- ening of the peritoneum. For its relief the neck of the sac is to be laid bare, as if there was an external stricture ; and if the intestine cannot be passed into the abdomen after division of all resisting bands on the exterior of the neck, the sac of the peritoneum is to be opened; and a director having been introduced through the con- striction, a cut is to be made horizontally inwards for the extent of one or two lines. The several vessels that may be wounded in at- tempting to relieve the deep stricture are enumerated at page 465. Scarpa's triangular space. Triangular space. Clean out Scarpa's space. Follow vessels, seek nerves, take away fat. Contents, extent, hase and sides, roof and floor. This hollow is situate on the front of the thigh, and lies beneath the superficial depression observed near Poupart's ligament. Dissection (fig. 190). The space will appear on removing the fascia lata near Poupart's ligament. The muscular boundaries on the sides may be first dissected, and the muscle on the outer side (sartorius) should be fixed in place with stitches. Afterwards the remains of the crural sheath are to be taken away; and the femo- ral vessels are to be followed downwards as far as the sartorius muscle. On the outer side of the vessels clean the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, together with the branches of an artery (pro- funda), which are buried in the fat. In removing the fat from be- neath the femoral artery, the student is to look for one or two small nerves to the pectineus muscle. Scarpa's triangle (fig. 190) is an intermuscular space contain- ing the trunks of the blood-vessels of the thigh, and the anterior crural nerve, with lymphatics and fat. It extends commonly over the upper third of the thigh ; but the length varies with the breadth of the sartorius, and the height at which this muscle crosses inwards. The base of the space is at Poupart's ligament; externally it is bounded by the inner border of the sartorius ; and internally by the inner border of the adductor longus. Towards the surface it is covered by the fascia lata, and by the integuments with inguinal glands and superficial vessels. The floor slopes backwards on each side towards the middle ; it is constructed externally, where it is of small extent, by the conjoined psoas and611 SCARPA'S TRIANGULAR SPACE. iliacus (b) ; and internally by the pectineus and adductor longus muscles (e and f) ; and between and beneath these, near the large vessels, is a small piece of the adductor brevis. > The femoral artery runs through the deepest part of the hollow lyina shcrhtly outside the centre of the space, and supplies small artery. cutaneous offsets, as well as a large deep branch, the profunda : a small offset (external pudic) is directed from it to the scrotum acroi the inner boundary.

Deep lymphatics accompany the femoral vessels, and are continued into the iliac glands in the abdomen ; they are joined by the super- ficial lymphatics. Femoral artery (fig. 192). This vessel is a continuation of the Internal iliac, and reaches from the lower border of Poupart's liga- ment to the opening in the adductor magnus muscle ; at that spot it passes into the ham, and takes the name popliteal. Occupying three- fourths of the length of the thigh, the course of the vessel will be indicated, dirring rotation outwards of the limb with the knee-joint half bent, by a line drawn from a point midway between the sym- physis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, to the prominent tuberosity of the inner condyle of the femur. In the upper part of its course the artery lies rather internal to the head of the femur, and is comparatively superficial, being un- covered by muscle ; but lower down it is placed along the inner side of the shaft of that bone, and is beneath the sartorius muscle. This difference in its relations allows of a division of the arterial trunk into two portions, superficial and deep. The superficial part of the artery (fig. 190, a), which is now laid bare, is contained in Scarpa's triangular space, and is from three to four inches long. Its position in that hollow may be ascertained by the line before mentioned. Encased at first in the crural sheath for about two inches, it is covered by the skin and the superficial fascia, and by the fascia lata and some inguinal glands. At its beginning the artery rests on the psoas muscle; and it is subsequently placed over the pectineus (e), though at some distance from the muscle in this position of the limb, and separated from it by fat, and the profunda and femoral veins. Its companion vein (h) is on the inner side and close to it at the pubis, but is placed behind the artery as it leaves the space. The anterior crural nerve lies on the outer side, being distant about a third of an inch near Poupart's ligament; and the internal cutaneous branch of the nerve lies over the artery along the edge of the sartorius. Crossing beneath the vessels is the nerve of the pectineus (2). Unusual position. Branches : An external pudic. Unusual position. A few examples of transference of the main artery of the limb from the front to the back of the thigh have been recorded. In these cases the vessel passed from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatlc foramen, and accompanied the great sciatic nerve to the popliteal space. The branches of the artery in Scarpa's space are the superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac, two external pudic, and the deep femoral branch. The cutaneous offsets have been seen (p. 601), with the exception of the following, which lies at first beneath the fascia lata. The inferior external pudic artery (tig. 190, e) arises separately from, or in common with, the other pudic branch. It courses in-613 TJPPEE PART OF FEMORAL VESSELS. wards over the pectineus muscle, and perforates the fascia lata at the inner border of the thigh to end in the scrotum or labium pudendi, according to the sex : in the fat it anastomoses with branches of the superficial perineal artery. The deep femoral branch or the profunda (fig. 192, 2) is the Profunda: largest offset of the femoral artery, and arises from the outer side of that trunk from one to two inches below Poupart's ligament. Its origin, distribution is to the muscles of the thigh, and will be afterwards followed. In the present dissection it may be seen to lie over and position the iliacus muscle, where it gives the external circumflex artery ^angl?*'8 to the outer part of the thigh: and then to turn, with a large vein, beneath the trunks of the femoral vessels to the inner side of the limb.* Variation in origin. The origin of toe profunda may approach nearer to origin of Poupart's ligament until it arrives opposite that band ; or may even go beyond, profunda and reach the external iliac artery (one example, R. Quain). And the vanes- branch may recede farther from the ligament, till it leaves the parent trunk at the distance of four inches from the commencement; but in this case the circumflex branches usually arise separately from the femoral. In applying a ligature to the femoral artery in the upper part of the thigh, the thread should be placed four inches below Poupart's ligament, in order that the spot chosen may be free from the disturbing influence of so large an offset. Femoral vein (fig. 190, h). The principal vein of the limb, while Femoral in the triangular space, has almost the same relative anatomy as the ™k j . d artery : its position to that vessel, however, is not the same through- the artery; out. Beneath Poupart's ligament it is on the inner side of the arterial trunk, and on the same level, and is supported on the pubis between the psoas and pectineus muscles ; but it soon winds beneath afterwards the artery, and is placed between the main trunk and its deep Mlind it- branch. In this space it receives the internal saphenous and deep femoral veins, and a small branch (i) with the inferior external pudic artery. DEEP PARTS OF THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. The muscles on the front of the thigh are to be learnt next: they Muscles on are the sartorius and the extensor of the knee ; and at the top ofthe fr°nt of the thigh is the small tensor of the fascia lata. Four muscles are ie combined in the extensor, viz., rectus, crureus, vastus externus, and vastus internus. The external circumflex branch of the profunda artery lies amongst vessels, the muscles and supplies them with branches; and a large nerve, Nevv the anterior crural, furnishes offsets to them. Dissection. To proceed with the deep dissection, the limb is to be Take the. retained in the same position as before, and the flaps of skin on the faS(:i!l from * Sometimes the term common femoral is applied to the trunk above the origin of the profunda, and the names superficial and deep femoral to the nearly equal pieces into which it divides.DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. the front of the thigh.

Sartorius: origin ; course over the thigh ; insertion. Relations of the first or oblique portion ; front of the thigh are to be thrown aside. The fascia lata is to be cut along the middle line of the thigh and knee, and to be reflected to each side nearly to the same extent as the skin. Over the knee- joint the student is to note its attachment to the edges of the patella, and its union with a prolongation from the tendon of the extensor muscle of the knee. In raising the inner piece of the fascia, the narrow muscle appear- ing (sartorius) should be followed to its insertion into the tibia ; and to prevent its displacement, it should be fixed with stitches along both edges. Care should be taken of the small nerves in contact with the sartorius, viz., a plexus beneath it at the middle of the thigh from the saphenous, internal cutaneous, and obturator; two branches of the internal cutaneous below its middle,—one crossing the surface, and the other lying along the inner edge of the muscle ; and the trunk of the great saphenous escaping from beneath it near the knee, with the patellar branch of the same perforating it rather higher. Internal to the sartorius some strong muscles (adductors) are inclined downwards from the pelvis to the femur. The student is to lay bare the fore part of these muscles ; and beneath the most superficial (adductor longus), near where it touches the sartorius, he is to seek a branch of the obturator nerve to the plexus before mentioned in the middle of the thigh. On the outer side of the sartorius is the large extensor of the knee. For its dissection the knee is to be bent, to make tense the fibres; and an expansion below from the common tendon to the fascia lata and the knee-joint is not to be removed now,—its arrangement will be noticed after. The little muscle at the upper and outer part of the thigh,—tensor of the fascia lata, is to be cleaned ; and a strip of the fascia, corre- sponding with the width of the muscle, should be left along the outer aspect of the limb. After this slip has been detached, the rest of the fascia on the outer side of the thigh is to be divided by one or two transverse cuts, and is to be followed backwards to its insertion into the femur. The sartorius (fig. 191, a) is the longest muscle in the body, and extends from the pelvis to the leg. It arches over the front of the thigh, passing from the outer to the inner side of the limb, and lies in a hollow between the extensor on the one side, and the adductors on the other. Its origin is tendinous from the upper anterior iliac spinous pro- cess of the hip-bone, and from about half the interval between this and the inferior process. The fibres constitute a riband-like muscle, which ends in a thin tendon below the knee, and is inserted into the inner surface of the tibia,—mainly into a slight depression by the side of the tubercle for an inch and a half, but also, by its upper edge, as far back as the internal lateral ligament of the knee- joint. The muscle is superficial throughout, and is perforated by some cutaneous nerves and vessels. Its upper part is oblique, and forms the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangle ; it rests on theVessels: a.

Deep part of femoral artery: relations ; position of veins and concealed by this portion of the muscle. The lower tendinous part (i) rests on the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, being superficial to the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, and separated from them by a prolongation of their synovial bursa : from its upper border there is an aponeurotic expansion to join that from the extensor over the knee; and from its lower border is given off another which blends with the fascia of the leg. Below the tendon the great saphenous nerve appears with vessels ; and piercing it is the patellar branch of the same nerve. Action. The tibia and femur being free to move, the muscle bends the knee and hip-joints over which it passes, giving rise to rotation inwards of the tibia, and outwards of the femur. With the limbs fixed, the two muscles will assist in bringing for- wards the pelvis in stooping; and when standing on one leg the muscle will help to rotate the body, so as to turn the face to the opposite side. Dissection (fig. 192). The sartorius is to be turned aside, or cut through if it is necessary, to follow the remaining part of the femoral artery. Beneath the muscle is an aponeurosis between the adductor and extensor muscles ; this is thin above, and when it is divided the internal saphenous nerve will come into view. Parallel to the saphenous nerve above, but outside it, is the nerve to the vastus internus muscle, which sends an offset on the surface of the vastus to the knee-joint: this may be traced now, lest it should be destroyed afterwards. The plexus of nerves on the inner side of the thigh may be more completely dissected at this stage. The femoral vessels and their branches are to be nicely cleaned. Where the femoral artery passes to the back of the limb its small anastomotic branch arises : this branch is to be pursued through the fibres of the vastus internus, and in front of the adductor magnus tendon, to the knee; an offset of it is to be followed with the saphenous nerve. The aponeurotic covering of the femoral vessels (fig. 192, ') exists only where these are covered by the sartorius. It is thin above; but below, it is formed of strong fibres, which are directed transversely between the vastus internus and the tendons of the adductor muscles. Inferiorly, the membranous structure ceases at the opening in the adductor magnus by a defined border, beneath which the saphenous nerve and its vessels escape. The DEEP PART OP THE FEMORAL ARTERY (fig. 192, ') lies in a hollow between the muscles (Hunter's canal) until it reaches the opening in the adductor magnus. It is covered by the sartorius muscle and the subjacent aponeurosis, in addition to the integu- ments and fascia. Beneath it are the pectineus, the adductor brevis in part, the adductor longus, and a small piece of the adductor magnus. On the outer side is the vastus interims. The femoral vein' lies close to the artery, on its posterior and outer aspect; and in the integuments oftentimes an offset of the saphenous passes across the line of the arterial trunk.LOWER PART OP PEMORAL VESSELS. 617 Lyin" along the front of the artery is the internal saphenous Derve nerve, which is beneath the aponeurosis before noticed, but is not contained within the areolar sheath of the vessels.

The anastomotic branch (fig. 193, h) arises close to the opening in the adductor muscle, and divides at once into two pieces, superficial and deep :— The superficial offset (n) continues with the saphenous nerve to the lower border of the sartorius, and piercing the fascia lata, ramifies in the integuments. The deep branch (I) is concealed in the fibres of the vastus internus, and descends in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus to the inner side of the knee-joint, where it anastomoses with the articular branches of the popliteal artery. A branch passes outwards from it in the substance of the vastus, and forms an arch at the upper border of the patella with an offset of the superior external articular artery. Muscular branches. Branches for the supply of the muscles come mostly from the outer side of the femoral artery; they enter the sartorius, the vastus internus, and the adductor longus. The femoral vein corresponds closely with the femoral artery in its relations and in its branches. Dissection. The femoral artery and vein are to be cut across below the origin of the profunda, and are to be thrown downwards pre- paratory to the deeper dissection. Afterwards all the fat, and all the veins, are to be carefully removed from amongst the branches of the profunda artery and anterior crural nerve. Unless this dis- section is fully carried out, the upper part of the vastus internus and crureus will not be prepared for learning. The tensor vagina femoris s. fasci/e LATiE (fig. 193, l) occu- pies the upper third of the thigh, and is the smallest and most external of the outer set of muscles. It takes origin from the front of the crest of the ilium at the outer aspect, from the anterior superior spine, and from the edge of the notch between this and the inferior spine as far as the attachment of the sartorius. Its fibres form a fleshy belly about two inches wide, and are inserted into the ilio-tibial band of the fascia lata about three inches below, and rather in front of the line of, the great trochanter of the femur. At its origin the muscle is situate between the sartorius and the gluteus medius. Beneath it are the ascending offsets of the external circumflex artery; and a branch of the superior gluteal nerve enters its under surface. A strong sheath of fascia surrounds the muscle. Action. Supposing the limb moveable the muscle abducts the thigh, and may help in rotating inwards the femur. When the limb is fixed it will support the pelvis, and assist in balancing the latter on the femur in walking. The chief function of the tensor vaginae femoris is, however, toQUADRICEPS EXTENSOR OF KNEE. 619 act with the gluteus niaximus in tightening the ilio-tibial band so as to support the extended knee (p. 634). Dissection. After the tensor has been learnt, the slip of fascia extending from it to the knee may be cut-through ; and when it is fascia, detached from the muscles around, the rectus may be followed up- wards to its origin from the pelvis. The QUADRICEPS EXTENSOR CRURIS (fig. 191) consists of four ^^nle"" parts or heads, one long or superficial (rectus), which springs from the pelvis, and three short or deep (vastus internus, crureus, and vastus externus) which arise from the femur: all are united below in a common tendon. The rectus femoris (fig. 192, 13) gives rise to a fleshy promi- ^eshas nence on the front of the thigh. It arises from the pelvis by two origin at tendinous heads : one, the anterior, is attached to the anterior in- Pehls- ferior iliac spine; and the other, posterior, is fixed to a rough mark on the outer surface of the ilium close above the acetabulum : near their origin they join to form a single tendon. The fleshy fibres Snto^om- terminate below in another tendon, which joins the aponeuroses of mon tendon, the other muscles in the common tendon. The rectus is larger in the middle than at the ends ; and its fibres Shee^'!le are directed from the centre to the sides, giving rise to the condi- form, and tion called penniform. Its upper end is covered by the tensor except0"*1' vaginaa femoris, iliacus, and sartorius ; but in the rest of its extent above, it is superficial. It conceals branches of the external circumflex artery and anterior crural nerve, and rests on the crureus and vasti. The upper tendon of the rectus reaches farthest on the anterior sur- face ; while the lower tendon is most extensive on the posterior aspect of the muscle. Dissection.

It takes origin from the upper half of the femur, by a piece from half an inch to an inch thick, which is attached to the root of the neck of the femur, and the fore and outer parts of the root of the great trochanter ; then along the outer side of the gluteal ridge, and the upper half of the linea aspera ; and lastly to the contiguous external intermuscular septum. Inferiorly the fibres of the muscle end in flat tendon, which blends with those of the other portions in the common tendon. The vastus externus is the largest part of the quadriceps, and produces the prominence on the outer side of the thigh. Its cutaneous surface is aponeurotic above, and is partly covered by the rectus, tensor vaginae femoris, and gluteus maximus muscles. The deep surface rests on the crureus, and receives branches of the external circumflex artery and anterior crural nerve. The vastus internus (fig. 191, e) also has a narrow origin from the inner surface of the femur along the linea aspera and the pro- longation upwards of its inner lip, reaching as high as the small trochanter ; and in the lower half of the thigh from the tendons of the adductor longus and adductor magnus. The fibres join an aponeurosis which blends in the common tendon, and is attached to the patella lower than the vastus externus. The muscular mass is in part covered by the sartorius and rectus, but it projects between those muscles below. Some of the lower fibres are almost transverse, and will be able to draw the patella inwards. The crureus arises from the upper three-fourths of the anterior and outer surfaces of the femur, except where they are occupied by the vastus externus, and from the lower half of the external inter- muscular septum. Its fibres end, like the other parts, in an aponeurosis which enters into the common tendon. The rectus and vasti cover the crureus except for a small extent at its lower and hinder part. It lies upon the bone and the sub- crureus muscle. The common tendon resulting from the union of the foregoing is attached to the fore part of the upper border of the patella. It is oblong in shape, and about three inches long. A few fibres are prolonged over the front of the bone into the ligamentum patella?, which forms the continuation of the tendon. Dissection. To see the continuation of the tendon, and its insertion into the tibia, the student should divide along the middle line of the patella and knee-joint a thin aponeurotic layer, which is derived from the lower fibres of the muscle, and covers the joint. On reflecting inwards and outwards the fibrous layer, the tendon will be exposed. The lower part of the common tendon, or ligamentum patellcc, is about two inches long, and is narrower and thicker than the part above the knee. It extends from the lower margin of the patella to the tujlercle of the tibia ; and a bursa separates it from the bone above itsi insertion. From the lower part of the vasti muscles a superficial aponeurotic621 EXTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. expansion is derived : this prolongation, which is strongest on the inner side, is united with the fascia lata and the other tendinous offsets to form a capsule in front of the joint, and is fixed below to the heads of the tibia and fibula. Subcrureus muscle. Beneath the crareus, near the knee-joint, is a Srallmib- thin layer of pale fibres, which is but a part of the large muscle, muscle separated from the rest by areolar tissue. Attached to the femur in ends on the the lower fourth, and often by an outer and inner slip, it ends in sJ,novial sa0- aponeurotic fibres on the synovial sac of the knee-joint. Action. All parts of the quadriceps extend the knee-joint when J^? ^^, the tibia is moveable; and the rectus can flex the hip-joint over aWe; which it passes. The fleshy bellies are strong enough to break the patella transversely over the end of the femur, or to rupture some- times the common tendon. With the tibia as the fixed point the vasti will bring forwards the witti tibia femur, and straighten the knee, as in rising from the stooping posture and jumping; and the rectus will prop the pelvis on the femur, or assist in moving it forwards in stooping.

The external septum is the stronger, aud reaches from the insertion the outer of the gluteus maximus to the outer condyle of the femur. It is stronger; situate between the vastus externus and crureus on the one side, and the short head of the biceps on the other, to all of which it gives origin : it is perforated near the outer condyle by the upper external articular vessels and nerve. The inner partition is very thin along the side of the vastus the inner is internus; and its place is supplied by the strong tendon ofmdlstillcfc- the adductor magnus between the inner condyle and the linea aspera. The EXTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (fig. 192, 4) is the chief Vessel External for the supply of the muscles of the front of the thigh. It arises artS^6* usually from the outer side of the profunda (deep femoral) artery, but often from the femoral trunk. It is directed outwards through the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and beneath the sartorius divides and rectus muscles, and supplies offsets to those muscles. Its terminal into branches are ascending, transverse, and descending :— The ascending branch is directed beneath the tensor vagina} ascending, femoris to the outer side of the hip, where it anastomoses with the gluteal artery, and supplies the contiguous muscles. The transverse branch, the smallest, divides into two or three transverse, which enter the vastus externus, and anastomose with the per- forating arteries. The descending branch is the largest, and ends in pieces which are and de- distributed to the crureus and vastus externus muscles. One con- pending siderable branch descends to the knee, and anastomoses witli the r<mDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 622 Anterior crural nerve is divided. From its superficial part arise— middle cutaneous; internal cutaneous, which has anterior and posterior branches ; nerve to pectiiieus; branches to sartorius. The deep part gives off branches to rectus, to vastus externus, to crureus, and to vastus internus; upper external articular artery ; a small offset courses over the muscle with a nerve to the joint. The anterior crural nerve (fig. 192, 8) of the lumbar plexus (p. 536) supplies the muscles, and most of the integuments of the front of the thigh, and the integuments of the inner side of the leg. Soon after the trunk of the nerve leaves the abdomen it is flattened, and is divided into superficial and deep pieces. A. The superficial part gives off the middle and internal cutaneous nerves, and branches to the sartorius and pectineus muscles. The middle cutaneous nerve perforates the fascia lata, sometimes also the sartorius, about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and extends to the knee (p. 603). The internal cutaneous nerve sends two or more small twigs through the fascia lata to the integument of the upper two-thirds of the thigh, and then divides in front of the femoral artery, or on the inner side, into anterior and posterior branches. . Sometimes these branches arise separately from the anterior crural trunk. The anterior branch is directed to the inner side of the knee. As far as the middle of the thigh it lies over the sartorius, but it then pierces the fascia lata, and ramifies in the integuments (p. 604). The posterior branch remains beneath the fascia lata as far as the knee (p. 604). While underneath the fascia the nerve lies along the inner border of the sartorius, and joins in a plexus, about the middle of the thigh, with offsets of the obturator, and nearer the knee, with a branch of the internal saphenous nerve. The nerve to tlie pectineus (fig. 190, 2) is slender, and is directed inwards beneath the femoral vessels to the anterior surface of the muscle : sometimes there are two branches. Two or three branches to the sartorius arise in common with the middle cutaneous nerve. B. The deep part of the anterior crural nerve furnishes branches to the several heads of the quadriceps extensor muscle, and one cutaneous nerve—the internal saphenous. The branch to the rectus enters the deep surface of the muscle; from this branch a twig is sent to the hip-joint. The nerve to the vastus externus divides into two or more pieces as it enters the muscle. From one of these an articular filament is often continued downwards to the knee-joint. Two or three branches to the crureus pass into the anterior surface of the muscle ; and from the most internal a long twig descends to the subcrureus and the knee-joint. The nerve to the vastus internus (fig. 193,8) is nearly as large as the internal saphenous, in common with which it often arises. To the upper end of the vastus it furnishes one or more branches, and is then continued as far as the middle of the thigh, where it ends in offsets to the muscle and the knee-joint. Its articular branch (fig. 193,9) is prolonged on or m the vastus, and on the tendon of the adductor magnus, to the inner side of the knee-joint, where it is distributed over the synovial membrane of623 ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. the articulation. This small nerve accompanies the deep branch of the anastomotic artery (p. 618). The internal or long saphenous nerve (fig. 192) is the largest branch and^iong^ of the anterior crural. In the thigh the nerve takes the course of ^t"om the deep blood-vessels, and is continued along the artery, beneath the aponeurosis covering the same, as far as the opening in the adductor magnus muscle. At that spot the nerve passes from beneath the aponeurosis, and is prolonged under the sartorius muscle to the upper part of the leg, where it becomes cutaneous (fig. 188,4). It supplies two offsets while it is beneath the fascia in the thigh. A communicating branch arises about the middle of the thigh, which has a and crosses inwards beneath the sartorius to join in the plexus of eating"1" the internal cutaneous and obturator nerves, or with the internal cutaneous nearer the knee : this branch is often absent. The patellar branch springs from the nerve near the knee-joint, Start and perforating the sartorius muscle and the fascia lata, ends in the integument over the knee (p. 604). A branch of nerve to the tensor vagince femoris is derived from ^irg™,of the superior gluteal (p. 637) ; it enters the deep surface of the vagina, muscle, and may be followed nearly to the lower end. Directions. After the examination of the muscles of the front of the adduc- the thigh, with their vessels and nerves, the student is to learn the tors, adductor muscles, and the vessels and nerves which belong to them. PARTS ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. The muscles in this position are the three adductors,—longus, The adduo- brevis, and magnus, with the gracilis and pectineus. These have tormuscles> the following position with respect to one another ;—Internal to all, and their and the longest, is the gracilis. Superficial to the others are the l1osltl0n- pectineus and the adductor longus ; and beneath the last two are the short adductor and the adductor magnus.

Position to other muscles. Use on knee joint and femur: on pelvis. Pectineus: nri<,'in bum pubis ; inserted into femur; illations of surfaces; and borders Use on femur free and fixed. Adductor longus ex- tends from pelvis to femur ; relations to muscles and vessels. Use on femur, pubic arch. Inferiorly it is inserted by a flat tendon, about one-third of an inch wide, into the inner surface of the tibia, beneath and close to the sartorius. The muscle is superficial throughout. For two-thirds of the thigh it is flattened against the adductors brevis and magnus, so as to have its borders directed forwards and backwards ; and in the lower third, it intervenes between the sartorius and semimembranosus muscles, and helps to form the inner boundary of the popliteal space. At its insertion the tendon is nearer the knee than that of the semitendinosus, though at the same depth from the surface, and both lie over the internal lateral ligament ; from the tendon an expansion is continued to the fascia of the leg, like the sartorius. A bursa separates the tendon from the ligament, and projects above it to the sartorius. Action. It bends the knee-joint if the tibia is not fixed, rotating in that bone, and then brings the moveable femur towards the middle line with the other adductors. Supposing the foot resting on the ground, the gracilis will aid in propping the pelvis on the limb. The pectineus (fig. 191, p) is the highest of the muscles directed from the pelvis to the inner side of the femur. It has a fleshy origin from the pubic portion of the ilio-pectineal line, and slightly from the surface in front of that line ; and it is inserted by a thin tendon, about two inches in width, into the femur behind the small tro- chanter, and into the upper part of the line which extends from that process to the linea aspera. One surface of the muscle is in contact with the fascia lata ; and the femoral vessels lie over its lower part : the opposite surface touches the obturator externus and adductor brevis muscles, and the superficial portion of the obturator nerve. The pectineus lies between the psoas and the adductor longus ; and the internal circumflex vessels pass between its outer border and the psoas. Action. It adducts the limb and bends the hip-joint. When the femur is fixed it can support the pelvis in standing; or it can draw forwards the pelvis in stooping. The adductor longus lies below the pectineus (fig. 191, g), and ,is triangular in form, with the apex at the pelvis and the base at the femur. It arises by a narrow tendon from the front of the pubis in the angle between the crest and the symphysis ; and it is inserted into the inner edge of the linea aspera. This muscle is situate between the gracilis and the pectineus, and forms part of Scarpa's triangular space. Its anterior surface is covered near the femur by the femoral vessels and the sartorius : the posterior rests on the other two adductors, on the superficial part of the obturator nerve, and on the deep femoral artery. The tendon of insertion is closely united to the adductor magnus and vastus internus. Action. With the femur moveable, it will flex the hip-joint, and with the aid of the oiher adductors will carry inwards the limb, soADDUCTOE BREVIS MUSCLE. 625 as to cross the thigh-bones. In walking it helps the other adductors to project the limb. With the femur fixed, the muscle props and tilts forwards the on pelvis. pelvis. Dissection, The adductor brevis muscle, with the obturator nerve Dissection and the profunda vessels, will be arrived at by reflecting the two Last muscles. On cutting through the pectineus near the pubis, ^sa°t^ and throwing it down, the dissector may find occasionally the small nerve: accessory nerve of the obturator which turns beneath the outer border; if this is present, its branches to the hip-joint and the obturator nerve are to traced out. The adductor longus is then cut adduc- . . , .i m tor longus, to be divided near its origin, and raised with care, so as not to destroy the branches of the obturator nerve beneath : its tendon is to be detached from that of the adductor magnus beneath it, to see the branches of the profunda artery. Now the adductor brevis will be laid bare. A part of the obtu- to sho«^ rator nerve crosses over this muscle to the femoral artery, and sends oreviS; an offset to the plexus at the inner side of the thigh : a deeper part of the same nerve lies beneath this adductor. The muscle should be separated from the subjacent adductor magnus, where the lower trace branch of the nerve with an artery issues. In this last step of the nerv™ 0 dissection, the student should follow on and in the fibres of the ad- and branch ductor magnus a slender articular branch of the obturator nerve ; joi^'16"* this will afterwards be traced to the knee (p. 649). The accessory obturator nerve (Schmidt) is derived from the Accessory , . „ , i i -i n /^r.wN i obturator trunk ot the obturator, near the lumbar plexus (p. 53/J, and passes nerve, from the abdomen over the brim of the pelvis. In the thigh it turns beneath the pectineus, and joins the superficial branch of the obturator nerve; it supplies an offset to the hip-joint with the articular artery, and occasionally one to the under surface of the pectineus. The adductor brevis (fig. 193, d) has a fleshy and tendinous Adductor origin, about one inch and a half in depth, from the front of the narrow at pubis below the adductor longus, and close outside the gracilis.

Behind the muscle is the adductor magnus, behind, with the deep piece of the obturator nerve and a branch of the internal circumflex artery. In contact with the upper border lies and at upper the obturator externus (f), and the internal circumflex artery passes bonlur' between the two. Action. This muscle adducts the limb with slight flexion of the Use on hip-joint, like the pectineus. And if it acts from the femur, it will ftKraJ.e' balance and move forwards the pelvis. The obturator nerve (fig. 193, ') is a branch of the lumbar Obturator plexus (p. 536), and supplies the adductor muscles of the thigh, as s sDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. * Deep dissection of the adductor muscles, with their vessels and nerves.

The deep part (4) of the obturator nerve pierces the fibres of ^eee£e\®gfc "f the external obturator muscle, and, continuing beneath the adductor brevis, is consumed chiefly in the adductor magnus. The following offsets are supplied by it :— Muscular branches enter the obturator extemus as the nerve ^"'jU(jnol, pierces it; others are furnished to the large, and sometimes to the magnus, short adductor. A slender articular branch (fig. 183,5) enters the fibres of the ?n4^^ adductor magnus, and passes through this near the linea aspera to knee-joint, reach the popliteal artery, by which it is conducted to the back of the knee-joint : its termination is seen in the dissection of the pop- liteal space (p. 649). Dissection. To prepare the profunda artery and its branches, as Dissect pro- far as they are to be seen on the front of the thigh, it will be flulda- requisite to follow back the internal circumflex artery above the upper border of the adductor brevis, and to trace the perforating branches to the apertures in the adductors near the femur. The profunda (fig. 193, c) is the chief muscular artery of the Profunda thigh, and arises from the femoral about an inch and a half below 17: Poupart's ligament (p. 613). At its origin the vessel is placed on origin, the outer side of the parent trunk ; but it is soon directed inwards course, beneath the femoral vessels to the inner side of the femur, and ends and ending; at the lower third of the thigh in a small branch that pierces the adductor magnus.

Internal circumflex ends on baok of thigh, supplies hip- j«int and muscles. Three perfo- rating branches: llrst second ; third : and the ending is a fourth. Anastomotic branches. Profunda vein. Cut through adductor brevis. placed first over the pectineus and adductor brevis, and thence to its termination between the adductors longus and magnus. Its branches are numerous to the surrounding muscles on the front and back of the thigh, and maintain free anastomoses with other vessels of the thigh (p. 653) ; through these communications the blood finds its way to the lower part of the limb when the chief artery is obliterated either above or below the origin of the profunda. The named branches are these :— a. The external circumflex artery (fig. 193, e) has been described in the dissection of the parts on the front of the thigh (p. 621). b. The internal circumflex artery (fig. 193, d) arises from the inner and posterior part of the profunda, and turns backwards between the psoas and pectineus, but above the adductor brevis. Opposite the small trochanter it ends in two branches, which will be seen in the dissection of the buttock (p. 643). It supplies the undermen- tioned offsets to the inner side of the thigh :— An articular wrtery enters the hip-joint through the notch in the acetabulum. At the border of the adductor brevis two muscular branches arise;-—one ascends to the obturator and the superficial adductor muscles ; the other, which is larger, descends with the deep piece of the obturator nerve beneath the adductor brevis, and ends in this and the largest adductor. c. The perforating arteries, three in number, pierce the tendons of some of the adductor muscles close to the linea aspera of the femur : they sujjply muscles on the back of the thigh, and wind round the bone to end in the vastus extemus and crureus (p. 653). The first (/) begins opposite the lower border of the pectineus, and perforates the short and large adductors. The second (g) arises below the middle of the adductor brevis, and passes through the same muscles as the jn'eceding. The third (h) springs from the deep femoral trunk below the adductor brevis, and is transmitted through the adductor magnus. From the second or third perforating vessel a medullary artery is supplied to the femur. The terminal branch of the profunda (fourth perforating) pierces the adductor magnus near the aperture for the femoral artery. d. Muscular or anastomotic branches (i) to the back of the thigh (three or four in number) pass through the adductor magnus at some distance from the linea aspera, and end in a chain of anasto- moses in the hamstrings (p. 653). The profunda vein results from the union of the different branches corresponding with the offsets of its companion artery. It accom- panies closely the artery of the same name, to which it is superficial, and ends above in the femoral vein. Dissection. To bring into view the remaining muscles, viz., ad- ductor magnus, obturator externus, and the insertion of the psoas and iliacus, the adductor brevis is to be cut through near the pelvis, and to be thrown down. Then the investing layer of fascia and areolar tissue is to be removed from each muscle.ADDUCTOR MAGNUS MUSCLE. 629 After the adductor magnus has been learnt, detacli a few of the upper fibres to examine the obturator externus. The adductor magnus (fig. 193, e) is triangular in form, with Adductor its base directed upwards, one side being attached to the femur, and magnus" the other free at the inner side of the thigh. The muscle arises from the conjoined rami of the pubis and origin is ischium along their inner margin, and from the lower impression '"ur<" ' on the ischial tuberosity. The anterior fibres diverge from their fibres origin, being horizontal above but more oblique below, and are thetoinsor- inserted (from above down) into the back of the femur close inside tion. the gluteal ridge, into the linea aspera, and into the internal supra- some being • horizontal condylar line for about an inch. The posterior fibres, from the ischial tuberosity, are vertical in direction, and end at the lower others third of the thigh in a tendon, which is inserted into the inner con-x ur 1 a ' dyle of the femur, siirroiuiding the adductor tubercle, and is con- nected by a fibrous expansion to the lower part of the internal supracondylar line. The muscle consists of two parts, which differ in their characters, and form The anterior, thin and fleshy, forms a septum between the other ad- w° p 3' ductors and the muscles on the back of the thigh; but the posterior piece, partly fleshy and partly tendinous, constitutes the inner thick margin of the muscle. On the anterior surface are the other two adductors and the pectineus, with the obturator nerve and the pro- Relations of funda vessels. The posterior surface touches the hamstring muscles ' and the great sciatic nerve. In contact with the upper border are and borders, the obturator externus and the quadratus femoris, with the trans- verse branch of the internal circumflex vessels ; and along the inner border lie the gracilis and the sartorius. At its attachment to the femur the muscle is closely united with the other adductors, par- ticidarly the adductor longus, and in its lower part with the vastus internus. Near the bone it is pierced by apertures for the passage of the femoral and perforating arteries. Action. This muscle is a powerful adductor ; and the part arising Use on from the tuberosity is also an extensor of the hip. In standing, the fu""ir' latter part of the muscle, acting from the femur, has an important j™ lkin ^ influence in steadying the hip-joint; and in walking, the great and ' other adductors co-operate with the gluteal muscles externally to support the pelvis on the fixed limb. The opening in the adductor for the transmission of the femoral Openlngfor vessels into the popliteal space is tendinous at the anterior, but Ulc vessHs: ileshy at the posterior aspect. It is situate at the junction of the upper three-fourths with the lowest fourth of the thigh, and is larger than is necessary for the passage of the vessels. On the outside it is bounded by the vastus internus ; and on the inside by the tendon of boundaries, the adductor magnus, with some fibres added from the tendon of the long adductor. The psoas and ILIAOUS (fig. 193) arise separately in the abdomen Psoas and (p. 531), but are united in the thigh, the conjoined portion of the c^ofigh- muscles lying beneath Poupart's ligament.

The adduc- tors cover it and it touches hip' joint. Use. Detach obturator. Obturator artery divides into two ; inner, and outer branch. fleshy iliacus (o) mainly joins the tendon of the psoas, hut a few of its fibres are fixed into a special triangular surface of hone in front of and below the trochanter. Beneath the ligament the muscles occupy the interval between the ilio-pectineal eminence and the anterior superior iliac spinous process ; and below the pelvis the mass covers the capsule of the hip-joint, a large bursa intervening. On the front of the psoas is the femoral artery, and between the two muscles lies the anterior crural nerve. The pectineus and the internal circumflex vessels are con- tiguous to the inner border; and the sartorius and vastus interims touch the outer edge. ^ Action. These muscles act as flexors of the hip-joint; and the use of the psoas on the spinal column is given with the description in the abdomen (p. 532). The obturator externus (fig. 193, f) is triangular in form, with the base at the pelvis and the apex at the femur. The fibres of the muscle take origin from the outer surface of the obturator membrane for the inner half, and from the bony circumference of the thyroid foramen for a corresponding extent,—the bony attach- ment being an inch wide opposite the body of the pubis, and reach- ing inwards to the adductor brevis and magnus. The fibres are directed backwards and outwards to be inserted by a tendon into the pit at the root of the great trochanter. This muscle is concealed by the pectineus, and adductor brevis and magnus. It covers the obturator membrane and vessels, and is pierced by the deep part of the obturator nerve. As it winds back it is in contact with the lower surface of the hip-joint. The insertion of the muscle will be seen in the dissection of the buttock (p. 644). Action. The muscle is an external rotator of the thigh ; but its action will be given in full with the other nmseles of the same group in the buttock (p. 644). Dissection. By detaching the obturator muscle from the pelvis, the branches of the artery of the same name will be seen beneath its fibres. The deep part of the nerve may be followed back to the foramen at the same time. A better view will be obtained if this dissection is deferred till after the limb is removed. The obturator artery is a branch of the internal iliac (p. 559), and enters the thigh through the top of the thyroid foramen. In the aperture the artery divides into two pieces, which form a circle on the obturator membrane beneath the muscle :— The internal piece runs along the inner half of the membrane, and furnishes offsets to the obturator externus and the upper ends of the adductor muscles. The external piece descends close to the outer edge of the foramen, and after giving a branch inwards to join the lower end of the pre- ceding, is continued to the ischial tuberosity and the muscles arising therefrom. Offsets pass to both obturator muscles ; and an articular twig is given to the hip-joint.631 CUTANEOUS NERVES OF BUTTOCK. Brunches of nerve to the obturator externus come from the deep of portion of the obturator, and enter the posterior surface of the muscle. Section II. THE BUTTOCK, OE THE GLUTEAL REGION. Directions. Both this Section and the following one (to p. 658) Directions, are to be completed by the student in the time appointed for the body to lie in the prone position. Position. During the dissection of the back of the thigh the body Position of is placed with the face down ; and the pelvis is to be raised by the h°'}*- blocks, until the lower limbs hang vertically over the end of the dissecting table. When the body is turned, the points of bone marking posteriorly the limit between the thigh and the abdomen can be better ascertained. Dissection. ThC'integument is to be raised from the buttock by Take up the means of the following incisions :—One is to be made along tbe skin: iliac crest, and is to be continued in the middle line of the sacrum to the tip of the coccyx. Another is to be begun where the first terminates, and is to be. carried outwards and downwards across the thigh till it is about six inches below the great trochanter. The flap of skin thus marked out is to be thrown down. Many of the cutaneous nerves of this region will be found in seek euta- the fat along the line of the iliac crest (fig. 194). Thus, in front, oTthV crest* but rather below the crest, are branches of the external cutaneous, if these have not been cut in the dissection of the thigh. Crossing the crest towards the fore part is a large offset of the last dorsal nerve; and usually farther back, but close to the bone, a smaller branch from the ilio-hypogastric nerve. At the outer border of the erector spinte are two or three branches of the lumbar nerves. By the side of the sacrum and coccyx two or three offsets of the ami by side sacral nerves are to be looked for beneath the fat. of sacrum: The remaining cutaneous nerves are derived from the small other nerves sciatic, and must be sought beneath the fat along the line of the sciatic" lower incision, where they come from underneath the gluteusbelow: maximus.

The iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric (') crosses the iliac crest in front of the branches from the lumbar nerves, lying in a groove in the bone, and extends generally only a short distance below the crest. Offsets of the external cutaneous nerve of the' thigh bend back- wards to the integuments above the great trochanter, and cross the ramifications of the last dorsal nerve. Posterior primary branches. The offsets of the posterior primary pieces of the lumbar nerves (°) are two or three in number, and cross the crest of the ilium at the outer edge of the erector spina?; they ramify in the integuments of the middle of the buttock, and some branches may be traced nearly to the great trochanter. The branches of the sacral nerves (5) perforate the gluteus maximus near the sacrum and coccyx, and are then directed out- wards for a short distance in the integuments over the muscle. These offsets are usually two in number: the largest is opposite the lower end of the sacrum, and the other by the side of the coccyx. Small sciatic ('). This nerve of the sacral plexus (p. 564) sends superficial branches to the- buttock. Its cutaneous offsets appear along the lower border of the gluteus maximus, accompanied by superficial branches of the sciatic artery ; two or three ascend round the edge of the muscle, and are lost in the integuments of the lower part of the buttock; the remaining branches (2) descend to the thigh, and will be afterwards noticed on it (p. 641). The perforating cutaneous nerve of the sacral plexus (4) turns round the edge of the gluteus maximus near the coccyx, and supplies the skin of the adjacent part of the buttock : this nerve has been exposed in the dissection of the perineum. Dissection. The thin and unimportant deep fascia of this region may be disregarded, in order that the great gluteal muscle, which is the most difficult in the body to clean, may be well displayed. To lay bare the muscle, let the student turn aside the cutaneous nerves, and adduct and rotate inwards the limb to make tense the muscular fibres. Having cut through the fat and fascia from the origin to the insertion, let him carry the scalpel along one bundle of fibres at a time in the direction of a line from the sacrum to the femur, until all the coarse fasciculi are cleaned. If the student has a right limb, it will be more convenient to begin the dissection at the upper border ; but if a left limb, at the lower margin of the muscle. The fascia of the buttock is a prolongation of that enveloping the thigh, and is fixed to the crest of- the ilium, and to the sacrum and coccyx.

From this extensive origin the fibres &tq directed downwards and outwards to their insertion:—The whole of the upper half of the muscle, and a few superficial fibres of the lower half are inserted into the strong fascia lata (ilio-tibial band) of the outer side of the thigh ; and the remainder are fixed into the rough line (gluteal ridge) leading from the linea aspera to the great trochanter of the femur. The gluteus forms the prominence of the buttock, and resembles the deltoid muscle of the arm in its situation and in the coarseness of its texture. Its cutaneous surface is covered by the common integuments and the investing fascia of the limb, and by the super- ficial nerves and vessels. The things in contact with the under surface will be seen when the muscle is cut through. The upper border overlies the gluteus medius. -The lower edge, which is longer and thicker than the upper, in its inner part bounds pos- teriorly the perineal space, and in the rest of its extent lies obliquely across the back of the thigh ; beneath it the hamstring muscles and the sciatic vessels and nerves issue. Action. With the femur hanging the muscle extends the hip-joint by putting back that bone ; and the upper part can abduct, but the part inserted into the femur will adduct and rotate out the limb. When the limb is fixed, and the body is raised from a sitting info a standing posture, the gluteus acts as an extensor of the articulation by moving back the pelvis ; and in standing on one leg, the muscle can draw the sacrum towards the femur, so as to turn the face to the opposite side. By tightening the ilio-tibial band, the gluteus maximus also supports and steadies the knee-joint in the extended position. In this action it is assisted by the tensor vaginae femoris, which corrects the tendency of the gluteus to draw the ilio-tibial band backwards. Dissection (fig. 195). The gluteus maximus is to be cut across a little external to the middle ; and the deptli of the muscle will be ascertained by the fascia and some vessels beneath it. When this intermuscular layer is arrived at, the outer piece of the gluteus may be at once thrown towards its insertion ; but the inner piece is to be carefully raised, and the branches of the inferior gluteal nerve, and of the gluteal and sciatic arteries entering its deep surface, are to be cleaned. The loose fat is then to be taken away from the hollow between the pelvis and the trochanter, without injuring the vessels and nerves ; and the several muscles are to be cleaned, the fibres of each being made tense at the time of its dissection by rotating the femur. The vessels, nerves, and muscles, which are to be defined, may be ascertained by referring to the enumeration below of the parts beneath the gluteus. In the areolar tissue from the635 PAETS UNDER GLUTEUS MAXIMUS. ischial tuberosity and the great trochanter, a bursa on each promi- nence of bone may be observed. Lastly, the fibres of the muscle are to be detached at their origin ; remove and the inner piece may be removed entirely by cutting through onsin> Fig. 195.* rves. the vessels and nerves that enter it. In doing this the sacral nerves and dissect are to be dissected out of the fleshy fibres, and to be followed to the ^saoral surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they will be after- wards seen. mJ^t i^7f the tli1ssection of the buttock (Illustrations of Dissections), ntntt i'.t US £?dT B- pyrifo«nw. 0.

Trace sacral nerves. The sacral nerves are united beneath gluteus: cutaneous offsets. Gluteus medius arises from hip-bone, audi inserted into tro- chanter. Relations Parts beneath the gluteus (rig. 195). At its origin tlie gluteus maximus rests on the pelvis, and conceals part of the ilium, .sacrum and coccyx, also the ischial tuberosity with the origin of the ham- string muscles (l) and the great sacro-sciatic ligament (k). At its insertion it covers the upper end of the femur, -with the great trochanter, and the origin of the vastus extemus (i). Between the muscle and the trochanter is a large, loose synovial membrane ; between it and the vastus extemus is another synovial sac ; and occasionally there is a third over the ischial tuberosity. In the hollow between the pelvis and the femur the muscle conceals, from above downwards, the undermentioned parts:— First, a portion of the gluteus medius (a) ; and below it the pyri- formis (b), with the superficial branch (a) of the gluteal vessels between the two. Coming from beneath the piriformis are the inferior gluteal nerve supplying the gluteus maximus, and the large and small sciatic nerves (3, 6), with the sciatic vessels, which descend to the thigh between the great trochanter and the ischial tuberosity ; and internal to the sciatic are the pudic vessels and nerve (</, '), and the nerve to the obturator interims muscle (6), which are directed inwards through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. Still lower down is the tendon of the obturator interims muscle (d) with a fleshy fasciculus—the gemellus (c and e)—above and below it. Next comes the thin quadratus femoris nmscle (g) with the upper part of the adductor magnua (h) ; at the upper border of the quadratus is the tendon of the obturator externus (f) ; and at the lower border, between it and the adductor, issues one of the terminal branches of the internal circumflex artery (<;) with its veins. Dissection. Tracing back the offsets of the sacral nerves which perforate the gluteus, and removing a fibrous stratum which covers them, the looped arrangement of the first three nerves on the great sacro-sciatic ligament will appear. Finally, the nerves may be followed inwards beneath the multifidus spina3 to the posterior sacral foramina. Sacral nerves. The external pieces of the posterior primary branches of the first three sacral nerves, after passing outwards beneath the multifidus spina? (p. 402), are joined by loops on the surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament (fig. 123). Two or three cutaneous offsets are derived from this intercom- munication, and pierce the fibres of the gluteus maximus to be distributed on the surface (p. 632). The gluteus medius (fig. 195, a) is triangular in form, with its base at the iliac crest, and apex at the femur. It arises from the outer surface of the ilium between the crest and the supe- rior curved line above, and the middle curved line below : and many superficial fibres come from the strong fascia covering the front of the muscle. The fibres converge^ to a tendon, which inserted into an impression across the outer surface of the trochanter, extending from the tip behind to the root in front. The superficial surface is concealed in part by the gluteus maxi- 1S great637 GLUTEAL VESSELS. mus; and the deep is in contact with the gluteus minimus, and the gluteal vessels and nerve. The anterior border lies over the gluteus minimus and is in contact with the tensor of the fascia, lata. The posterior is contiguous to the pyriformis, only the superficial part of the gluteal vessels intervening. A small bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion and the trochanter. Action. The whole muscle abducts the hanging femur; and the f™™m anterior fibres rotate in the limb. hanging; Both limbs resting on the ground, the muscles assist in fixing the both limbs pelvis. In standing on one leg this gluteus will aid in balancing fixetl; the pelvis on the top of the femur, and will draw the body over to iu standing « i on one leg, the same side. In walking the fore part of the muscle acts in rotating the pelvis and walking, over the fixed limb. Dissection. "When the gluteus medius is detached from the pelvis, Detach and partly separated from the gluteus minimus beneath, the gluteal medius to vessels and the superior gluteal nerve will come into view. The two ^g",1^3,1 chief branches of the artery,—one being near the iliac crest, and the other lower down,—are to be traced beneath the fleshy fibres as the reflection of the gluteus is proceeded with ; and the main piece of the nerve is to be followed forwards to the tensor vagina? femoris and nerve, muscle.

The other portion (inferior; c) is directed ^da^lower* forwards over the middle of the smallest gluteal muscle, with the branch, nerve, towards the anterior lower iliac spine, where it enters the tensor of the fascia lata, and communicates with the external cir- cumflex branch (p. 621) : many offsets are furnished to the gluteus minimus, and some pierce that muscle to supply the hip-joint.

One surface is in contact with the gluteus medius, and the gluteal vessels and nerve ; the other with the hip-bone, the hip-joint, and the outer head of the rectus femoris muscle. The anterior border lies by the side of the gluteus medius ; and the posterior is covered by the pyiiformis muscle. A bursa is placed between the. tendon and the bone. Action. This muscle agrees in its action with the gluteus medius ; but as it reaches farther backwards, the hinder fibres may also have some, influence in rotating out the hanging femur. Dissection. Cut through the smallest gluteal muscle near the ilium, and define the tendinous portion of the rectus femoris under- neath it, close above the hip-joint. While detaching the gluteus from the parts underneath, the student cannot fail to notice the connection between its tendon and the capsule of the joint. The deep vessels to the articulation may be observed and followed as the muscle is removed. The posterior or reflected head of the rectus femoris is a tendon as wide as the little finger, and about two inches long, which is fixed into the impression above the margin of the acetabulum. In front it joins the straight head, which is attached to the anterior inferior iliac spine ; and its lower border is connected with the capsule of the hip-joint. The pyriformis (fig. 195, b) arises in the pelvis from the front of the sacrum (p. 588), and leaves that cavity through the great saero-sciatic foramen. Outside the pelvis it ends in a rounded tendon, which is inserted into the upper edge of the great trochanter, between the two smaller glutei. The muscle occupies the greater part of the sacro-sciatic foramen, and divides the vessels and nerves passing through that aperture into two groups :—Above it are the gluteal vessels and the superior gluteal nerve ; and below it the sciatic and pudic vessels and nerves, and some other branches of the sacral plexus. Its upper border is contiguous to the gluteus medius; and its lower, to the superior gemellus. Like the other rotator muscles in this situation, it is covered by the gluteus maximus, and by the gluteus medius at the insertion; it rests on the gluteus minimus, which separates Ll from the hip-joint. Its tendon is united by fibrous tissue to that of the obturator and gemelli. Action. The pyriformis rotates out the femur when that bom- is in a line with the trunk ; but if the hip-joint is bent it abducts tin- limb. Both limbs being fixed, the muscles balance the pelvis, and help to make the trunk erect after stooping to the ground. In standing on one leg, besides assisting to support the trunk, the pyriformis turns the face to the opposite side.SCIATIC AND PUDIC VESSELS. 639 Dissection. The pyrifomris may be cut across and raised towards Dissect the sacrum, to allow the dissector to follow upwards the sciatic and c£ief ves. pudic vessels, and to trace the accompanying nerves to their origin sels and from the sacral plexus.

A branch to the quadratus and inferior gemellus (6) may be found by raising the trmik of the great sciatic nerve ; but this will be followed to its termination after the muscles it supplies have been seen. Sciatic and Pudic Vessels. The arteries on the back of the ^iev^^s pelvis, below the pyriformis muscle, are branches of the internal the iliac, iliac (p. 559). The sciatic artery (fig. 195, b) supplies the buttock below the Sciatic gluteal. After escaping from the pelvis below the pyriformis, it artery- descends with the small sciatic nerve over the gemelli and obturator intemus muscles, as far as the lower border of the gluteus maximus ; course here the artery gives off many branches with the superficial offsets and ending; of its companion nerve; and much reduced in size, it is continued with that nerve along the back of the thigh. In this course it furnishes the following branches :— branches;— a. The coccygeal branch, arising close to the pelvis, perforates the coccygeal; great sacro-sciatic ligament and the gluteus maximus, and ramifies in this muscle, and on the back of the sacrum and coccyx. 6. The branch to the great sciatic nerve (comes nervi ischiadici) is branch to very slender, and entering the nerve near the pelvis, ramifies in it nerve0; along the thigh. c. Muscular branches enter the gluteus maximus, the upper muscular; gemellus, and obturator intemus ; and by means of a branch to the cpiadratus, which passes with the nerve of the same name beneath the gemelli and obturator intemus, it gives offsets to the hip-joint and the inferior gemellus. d. Anastomotic branch (fig. 195, e). Varying in size, this artery is anasto- directed outwards to the root of the great trochanter, where it motio' anastomoses with the internal circumflex and first perforating arteries. The pudic artery (fig. 195, d) belongs to the perineum and the Pudic genital organs : it is smaller than the sciatic, internal to which it arfcery lies. Only the small part of the vessel which winds over the ischial crosses the spine is seen on the back of the pelvis, for it enters the perineal .space through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, and is there dis- tributed (p. 421). It supplies a small branch over the back of the sacrum, which offsets, anastomoses with the gluteal and sciatic arteries ; and a twig from it accompanies the nerve to the obturator intemus muscle. The veins with the sciatic and pudic arteries receive contributing veins l wigs corresponding with the branches of those arteries at the back of the pelvis, and open into the internal iliac vein. Nerves. The nerves appearing at the back of the pelvis, below Nerves come the pyriformis, are derived from the sacral plexus (p.. 562) ; the ^saornIDISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 640 Inferior gluteal to gluteus maxiinus. largest are furnished to parts beyond the gluteal region, hut some are distributed to the muscles at the back of the pelvis.

The short trunk is directed backwards below the pyriformis, and divides Fig. 196.* branches which radiate upwards and downwards, gluteus maximus midway between its origin and into numerous and enter the insertion. The small sciatic (fig. 195/) is a cutaneous nerve of the back It sidings from the second and third sacral nerves (fig. 196, ss), and takes the course of the sciatic artery as far as the lower border of the great gluteus, where it gives many cutaneous branches.

The descending cutaneous branches (fig. 194,2) supply the integu- ^doending ments of the upper third of the thigh at the inner and posterior cutaneous aspects. One of these branches (fig. 195,7), which is larger than the branches; others, is distributed to the genital organs, and is named inferior infertor^ pudendal (p. 425); as it courses to the perineum, it turns below the Pur°° a ischial tuberosity, and perforates the fascia lata at the inner side of the thigh to end in the scrotum. The great sciatic (fig. 195,6) is the largest nerve in the body. Great sciatic It is the source of all the muscular, and most of the cutaneous ™™^e Qf branches to the limb beyond the knee, as well as of the muscular branches at the back of the thigh. At its origin it appears to be a prolongation of the sacral plexus (fig. 196, as). It is directed through the buttock to the back of course in niii the buttock * the thigh, and rests on the external rotator muscles below the pyriformis. Commonly it does not supply any branch to the "j!^™11?^11 buttock, but it may give origin to one or two filaments to the hip- ' 1S iegl0n- joint. Frequently the nerve is divided into two large trimks at its origin, and one of them (the external popliteal) pierces the fibres of the pyriformis muscle. The pudic nerve (fig. 195/) winds over the small sacro-sciatic Pudic nerve, ligament by the side of its companion artery, and is distributed with this vessel to the perineum and the genital organs (p. 421). No branch is supplied to the buttock. Small muscular branches of the sacral plexus are furnished to Muscular the external rotators except the obturator externus. The branch to the pyriformis is seen in the dissection of the sacral to plexus in the pelvis (p. 564). pyriformis; The nerve to the obturator internus (fig. 197,5) arises from the to obturator upper part of the plexus, and is directed to its muscle through the superiora1"1 small sacro-sciatic foramen with the pudic vessels : it gives off a gemellus; small twig to the superior gemellus ('). The nerve to the quadratus femoris (fig. 197,6) is a slender branch, toquadratus which passes with a companion artery beneath the gemelli and the ^melius'01 obturator to the anterior surface of its muscle. This branch will be seen more fully in a subsequent dissection, when offsets from it to the inferior gemellus and the hip-joint may be traced. Dissection. To see the remaining external rotator muscles, book clean rota- aside the great sciatic nerve, and take away the branches of the tor muscIes- sciatic artery if it is necessary. In cleaning these muscles the limb should be rotated inwards. The gemelli are to be separated from the tendon of the obturator internus. The superior gemellus (fig. 195, c) is the higher of the two Superior muscular slips along the sides of the tendon of the obturator gemellus- muscle. Internally it arises from the outer and lower part of t x642 DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. Inferior gemellus: both in- serted with obturator; use to help obturator.

Quadratus femoris: origin; insertion; parts over and be- neath it, and at lower border: the ischial spine, and externally it is inserted with the obturator into the great trochanter. Sometimes the muscle is absent. The inferior gemellus (fig. 195, e) is larger than its fellow. Its origin is connected with the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, along the lower edge of the groove for the obturator internus muscle; and its insertion is in common with the obturator tendon. This muscle is placed between the obturator internus and quadratus, but near the femur the tendon of the obturator externus comes into contact with its lower border. Action. These small fleshy slips are but accessory pieces of origin to the internal obturator, with which they combine in use. The obturator internus (fig. 195, d) arises from the hip-bone inside the pelvis (p. 588), and passes to the exterior through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. The tendon of the muscle is directed outwards over the hip-joint, and is inserted with the gemelli, in front of the pyriformis, into the inner side of the great trochanter, at the upper and fore part. Outside the pelvis the obturator is mostly tendinous, and is em- braced by the gemelli muscles in the following way ; near the pelvis the gemelli meet beneath, but near the trochanter they cover the tendon. Crossing the muscle are the large and small sciatic nerves and the sciatic vessels; and covering the whole is the gluteus maximus. On cutting through the tendon and raising the inner end, it will be found divided into four or five pieces as it turns over the margin of the pelvis (fig. 197, h) ; at this spot the bone is covered with cartilage, which forms ridges corresponding to the intervals between the tendinous slips, and the surfaces are lubri- cated by a synovial sac. There is sometimes another bursa between the tendon and the back of the hip-joint. Action. The action of this muscle is in all respects the same as that of the pyriformis (p. 638). The quadratus femoris (fig. 195, g) is situate between the inferior gemellus and the adductor magnus. Internally it arises from the outer border of the ischial tuberosity for two inches, by the side of the semimembranosus and adductor magnus ; externally it is inserted into a tubercle on the posterior intertrochanteric ridge of the femur (tubercle of the quadratus), and along a line on the upper end of that bone for about two inches, above the attachment of the great adductor. By one surface it is in contact with the sciatic vessels and nerves, and the gluteus maximus. By the other it rests on the obturator externus, the internal circumflex vessels, and its small nerve and vessels. Between its lower border and the adductor magnus the transverse branch of the internal circumflex artery issues. Between it and the small trochanter is a bursa, which is also common to the upper part of the adductor magnus. Action. The quadratus differs from the foregoing muscles of the same group in being able to rotate out the femur when the hip-joint is bent, as well as in the extended position; and it will assist slightly in adducting the limb.643 INTEENAL CIKCUMFLEX AETEEY.

The other (transverse; h) passes between the quadratic and adductor magrras to the hamstring mus- cles, and communicates with the perforating arteries. The obturator externus (fig. 197, l) has been dissected at its origin in the front of the thigh (p. 630). The part of the muscle now laid hare winds below the hip-joint, and ascends to be inserted into the pit at the root of the trochanter. On the back of the pelvis the obturator externus is covered by the quadratus, except near the femur where it is exposed between that muscle and the inferior gemellus (fig. 195, p). Its deep surface is in contact with the capsule of the hip-joint and the neck of the femur. Action. Like the quadratus femoris, it rotates out the femur in all positions of the limb : it is also to a slight extent an adductor and flexor of the hip-joint. The sacro-sciatic ligaments pass from the sacrum and coccyx to the ischium : they are two in number, and are named great and small. The great or posterior ligament (fig. 197, p) is attached above to the posterior inferior iliac spine, and to the side of the sacrum and coccyx ; and below, to the inner margin of the ischial tuberosity, sending forwards a prolongation along the ramus of the bone : some of the superficial fibres are continued over the tuberosity into the long head of the biceps. It is wide next the sacrum, and becomes narrower below; but it is somewhat expanded again at the tuberosity. On the cutaneous surface are the branches of the sacral nerves ; and the gluteus maximus conceals and takes origin from it. Branches of the sciatic artery and a cutaneous nerve from the sacral plexus perforate it. The small or anterior ligament passes from the sacrum and coccyx to the ischial spine. This band is more fully seen in the dissection of the pelvis (p. 591). These ligaments convert the deep sacro-sciatic notch of the dried pelvis into two foramina. Between their insertion into the spine and tuberosity of the hip-bone is the small sacro-sciatic foramen, which contains the internal obturator muscle with its nerve and vessels, and the pudic vessels and nerve. And above the smaller ligament is the large sacro-sciatic foramen, which gives passage to the pyriformis muscle, with the gluteal vessels and the superior gluteal nerve above it, and the sciatic and pudic vessels and nerves, the inferior gluteal nerve, and the nerves to the obturator interims and quadratus femoris below it, Section III.

When this space has been learnt, the student will return to the dissection of the thigh. Position. The limb shoidd be raised into the horizontal position. Position. Dissection (fig. 198). To remove the skin from the popliteal T^ette^ region, let a longitudinal incision be made behind the knee for the ovei.the distance of six inches above, and four inches below the j oint. At each »ain. extremity of this cut make a transverse incision, and raise the skin in two flaps, the one being turned outwards and the other inwards.

A and take the large quantity of fat may be next taken out of the space, but without Jf^fom the injury to the several small vessels and nerves in it. In cleaning the space the student will come upon the large inter- Seek the nal popliteal nerve in the middle, and the external popliteal on the theTpace. outer side. Both nerves give branches ; and the numerous offsets of the inner will be recognized more certainly by tracing them from above down along the trimk of the nerve, than by proceeding in the opposite direction : in fat bodies the two small nerves from the inner popliteal trunk to the knee-joint are difficult to find. Under cover of the outer boundary, and deep in the space, is an articular nerve from the external popliteal. In the bottom of the space are the popliteal vessels, the vein being clean the more superficial than the artery. The student is to seek an articular vessels; branch (superior) on each side, close above the condyle of the femur, and to clean numerous other branches of the vessels to the muscles around, especially to those of the calf. On the upper part of the find obtu- artery, the branch of nerve from the obturator to the knee-joint is ^dgiands' to be found ; and on the sides of the artery are three or four lym- phatic glands in the fat. After the ham has been cleaned, the saitorius and the gracilis are to be replaced in their natural position on the inner side. The popliteal space, or ham (fig. 198), is the hollow behind The ham: the knee : it allows of the free flexion of the joint, and contains the large vessels of the limb. When dissected, this interval has the situation form of a lozenge, and extends upwards along one-third of the ancl exto,,t '< femur, and downwards along one-sixth of the tibia ; but in the natural condition the muscles on the sides are approximated by the fascia of the limb, and the space is limited almost to the region of the joint.646 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. boundaries, outer and inner; limit above and below; This hollow is situate between the muscles on the back of the limb ; and the lateral boundaries are therefore formed by the muscles of the thigh (hamstrings), and leg. Thus, on the outer side, is the biceps muscle (°) as far as the joint, and the plantaris and the external head of the gastrocnemius (8) beyond that spot. On the inner side, as low as the articulation, are the semimembra- nosus (4) and semitendinosus superficial and deep boundaries; ijreatest width and depth ; contents.

Fig. 198* (5) muscles with the gracilis and sartorius between them and the femui; and beyond the joint is the inner head of the gastrocnemius ('). The upper point of the ham is formed by the apposition of the inner and outer hamstrings ; and at the lower point the heads of the gas- trocnemius touch each other. Stretched over the cavity are the fascia lata and the integuments. In the deep boundary, or the floor, are the following things,—the surface on the back of the femur included between the lines to the condyles (popliteal surface), the posterior liga- ment of the knee-joint, and part of the popliteus muscle with the upper end of the tibia. The popliteal space is widest and deepest immediately above the fe- moral condyles. Above and below it communicates, beneath the muscles, with the back of the thigh and leg. In the hollow are contained the popliteal vessels with their branches, and the ending of the external sa- phenous vein; the popliteal trunks of the great sciatic nerve, and some of their branches ; together with lymphatic glands, and a large quan- tity of fat. The small sciatic nerve and its vessels are placed superficially in the ham; and a branch of the obturator nerve lies on the artery in the bottom of the space. The popliteal artery (fig. 198, *) is the continuation of the femoral, and reaches from the opening in the adductor magnus to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it terminates by bifurcating into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. A portion of the artery lies in the popliteal space, and is not covered by muscle; * View of the popliteal space (Quain's Arteries). 1. Popliteal vessels. 2. Internal popliteal nerve. 3.

The description of the artery may be conveniently divided into two parts,—one reaching to the lower limit of the ham, and the other being beneath the gastrocnemius. As far as tJie ham the vessel is inclined obliquely from the inner The part in side of the limb to the interval between the condyles of the femur, the am' and is then directed along the middle of the space over the knee- course and joint. The artery is overlain by the belly of the semimembranosus re a 10US' muscle to within an inch of the internal condyle ; but thence onwards it is situate between the heads of the gastrocnemius, and is covered only by the fascia lata and the integuments. Beneath it is the femur, with the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. In contact with the vessel, and somewhat on the outer side at g^1*1*?™ of first, lies the popliteal vein, so that on looking into the space, the arterial trunk is almost covered ; but in the interval between the heads of the gastrocnemius, the vein and its branches conceal altogether the artery. In the lower part of the ham the short saphenous vein (fig. 199, i), and the muscular branches of the artery, are also superficial to the popliteal trunk. More superficial than the large vessels, and slightly external to and of the them in position, is placed the internal popliteal nerve, which, with its branches, lies over the artery, like the vein, between the heads of the gastrocnemius. In the bottom of the hollow the small obturator nerve runs on the artery to the joint. Dissection. To see the deep part of the artery, the inner head of ]^(1i™etr1)e the gastrocnemius should be cut through and raised. On removing gastrocne- the areolar tissue the vessels and nerves will appear. The lower inius- articular branches of the vessels and nerve are now brought into view;—the inner artery is below the head of the tibia, and the outer, higher up, between the tibia and fibula, each with a vein; and the first has a companion nerve. Beyond the ham. "While the artery is beneath the gastrocnemius Artery be- (fig. 204) it sinks deeply into the limb ; here it is crossed by a small yond ham: muscle—the plantaris (c), and the ending is concealed by the soleus (b). It rests on the popliteus muscle. Both the companion vein and the internal popliteal nerve change position of their position to the artery, and gradually cross over to it, so as to „er^eand lie on its inner side at the lower border of the popliteus. Sometimes the artery is divided as high as the back of the knee- joint ; and then the anterior tibial artery may lie beneath the pop- liteus muscle.

The cutaneous or superficial sural branches descend to the skin of the calf of the leg : they are usually three in number, one in the middle line, and one over each head of the gastrocnemius. c. The superior articular arteries arise from the popliteal trunk, one from the inner and one from the outer side, above the condyles of the femur ; they are directed almost transversely beneath the hamstring muscles, and turn round the bone to the front of the joint. The external branch (k) perforates the intermuscular septum, and divides in the substance of the crureus. Some of the branches end in that muscle, and anastomose with the external circumflex (of the profunda) ; others descend to the joint and anastomose with the lower external articular artery ; and one offset forms an arch across the front with the anastomotic artery. The internal artery (I), oftentimes very small, winds beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus, and terminates in the vastus in- ternus ; it supplies this and the knee-joint, and communicates with the deep part of the anastomotic artery. d. The inferior articular arteries (fig. 204) lie beneath the gastro- cnemius, but are not on the same level on opposite sides of the limb ; for the inner one descends below the internal tuberosity of the tibia, while the outer one is placed above the head of the fibula. Each lies beneath the lateral ligament of its own side. The external branch (c) supplies the outer side of the knee-joint, anastomosing with the other vessels on the articulation, and with the recurrent branch of the anterior tibial artery ; it sends an offset beneath the ligament of the patella to join a twig from one of the internal branches. The internal artery (b) ramifies over the front of the internal tuberosity of the tibia, and anastomoses Math the upper internal and lower external articular branches, and with the superficial branch of the anastomotic artery. e. The azygos branch enters the joint through the posterior liga- ment, and is distributed to the ligamentous structures, the fat, and the synovial membrane of the interior. The popliteal vein (fig. 199, h) originates in the union of the anterior and posterior tibial venae comites, and has the same extent and relations as the artery it accompanies. At the lower border of the popliteus muscle the vein is internal to the arterial trunk; between the heads of the gastrocnemius it is superficial to that vessel; and thence to the opening in the adductor magnus it lies to the outer side of, and close to, the artery. It is joined by branches corresponding with those of the artery, as well as by the short saphenous vein. The Popliteal Nerves (fig. 198) are the two large trunks derived from the division of the great sciatic in the thigh (p. 652), and are named internal and external. Each furnishes cutaneous and articvdar offsets, but only the inner one supplies branches to muscles.POPLITEAL NERVES AND BRANCHES. 649 The internal popliteal nerve (2) is larger than the external, jgg* and occupies the middle of the ham : its relations are similar to ,iei.ve: those of the artery, that is to say, it is partly superficial, and partly covered by the gastrocnemius. The nerve is continued to the back of the leg; but it retains the name popliteal only to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its position to the vessels has been branches already noticed. The branches arising from it are the following :— are a. Two small articular twigs (fig. 199,9) are furnished to the ^. knee-joint with the vessels. One accompanies the lower internal'r articular artery to the front of the articulation, and is the larger ; the other takes the same course as the azygos artery, and enters the back of the joint with it. b. Muscular branches arise from the nerve between the heads °f^ ula].. the gastrocnemius. One is furnished to each head of the gastro- mu30U ai > cnemius, and the outer of these usually supplies the plantaris. Another descends beneath the gastrocnemius, and enters the posterior surface of the soleus. And a fourth penetrates the popliteus at the anterior aspect, after turning round the lower border. c. The tibial communicating branch (fig. 203,3) is a cutaneous and one offset to the leg and foot. It lies beneath the fascia, and between the'tibiaT' the heads of the gastrocnemius, as far as the middle of the leg, °°m1™uni" where it becomes superficial, and unites with the peroneal com- municating branch of the external popliteal, to form the short saphenous nerve (p. 660). The external popliteal nerve (peroneal; fig. 198,3) lies along External the outer boimdary of the ham, and is at first concealed by the edge ^rve f*1 of the biceps muscle ; becoming superficial, it is continued over the outer head of the gastrocnemius, following the hinder border of the course biceps tendon, until it is below the head of the fibula. There it and ending; enters the fibres of the peroneus longus, and divides beneath that muscle into two—musculo-cutaneous and anterior tibial. Its branches branches are articular and cutaneous :— a. The articular nerve, arising high in the space, runs with the articular; upper external articular artery to the outer side of the knee, and sends a twig along the lower articular artery: both enter the joint. b. The peroneal communicating branch (fig. 203,4) soon pierces peroneal the fascia, and descends over the outer head of the gastrocnemius to eating1;""" join the tibial commivnicating from the internal popliteal in the short saphenous nerve. c. One or two external cutaneous branches arise either in common and external with the preceding or separately, and supply the skin of the outer ontg'.e0US side of the leg, reaching nearly to the external malleolus. The ARTICULAR BRANCH OE THE OBTURATOR NERVE (fig. 199, 7) Articular perforates the adductor magnus (p. 627), and is conducted by the obturator10 popliteal artery to the back of the knee.

The limb being replaced in the hanging position, the piece of skin between the buttock and the ham should be divided and reflected to the sides. In the fat on the outer side of the limb fine offsets of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh may be found ; and along the middle some filaments from the small sciatic nerve pierce the fascia. Remove the deep fascia of the limb, taking care of the small sciatic nerve and its artery. Lastly, clean tbe hamstring muscles ; trace the perforating and anastomotic arteries from the front of the thigh ; and clean the branches of the great sciatic nerve to the muscles. Muscles. The muscles behind the femur are flexors of the knee- joint. They reach from the pelvis to the bones of the leg, and are named hamstrings from their cord-like appearance on the sides of the ham. They are three in number, viz., biceps, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. The first of these lies on the outer, and the others on the inner side of tbe popliteal space. The biceps (fig. 199, d) has two heads of origin, long and short, which are attached to the pelvis and the femur. The long head arises from the upper and inner impression on the ischial tuberosity, in common with the semitendinosus muscle. The short head is fixed to the femur below the gluteus maximus, viz., to all the linea aspera, and to the upper three-fourths of the line leading to the outer condyle, as well as to the external intermuscular septum. The fibres end below in a tendon, which is inserted into the head of the fibula by two slips which embrace the external lateral ligament; and a slight piece is prolonged to the head of the tibia. ■ The muscle is superficial, except at the origin, where it is covered by the gluteus maximus ; it rests on the upper end of the semimem- branosus, on the great sciatic nerve, and on the adductor magnus muscle. On the inner side are the semitendinosus and semimem- branosus as far as the ham. Its tendon gives an offset to the deep fascia of the limb. Action. It can bend the knee if the leg-bones are not fixed, and afterwards rotate out the tibia ; and the long head will extend the bent hip-joint when the knee is straight. The leg being supported on the ground, the long head will assist in balancing and erecting the pelvis ; and the short head will draw down the femur so as to bend the knee in stooping. The semitendinosus (fig. 199, e) is a slender muscle and receives its name from its appearance. It arises from the tuberosity of the ischium with the long head of the biceps, and by fleshy fibres from the tendon of that muscle. Inferiorly it is inserted into theTHE HAMSTRING MUSCLES, inner surface of the tibia, close below the gracilis, and for a similar CX This muscle, like the biceps, is partly covered by the gluteus parts* maximus.

From its position, the ilio-femoral ligament will arrest extension of the joint; and when the femur is fixed in standing it will support the pelvis. At the inner and fore part of the joint is a much smaller band (fig. 200, b), which extends from the prominent portion of the pubis internal to the acetabulum to the lower end of the anterior inter- trochanteric line, and is named the pubo-fcmoral ligament.

The cotyloid ligament (fig. 186, g) is a narrow band of fibro- cartilage, which is fixed to the margin of the acetabulum, and is prolonged across the notch below, so as to form part of the trans- verse ligament. Its fibres are not continued around the acetabulum, but are fixed to the margin of the cavity, and cross one another in the band. It is thickest at its attachment to the bone, and becomes gradually thinner towards the free margin, where it is applied to the head of the femur. This ligament fills up the hollows in the rim of the acetabulum, deepens the socket for the femur, and makes a flexible margin to the cavity, which can yield slightly when the neck of the femur is pressed against it. The transverse ligament (fig. 186) bridges across the notch in the margin of the acetabulum. It consists partly of deep special fibres (h) which are attached to the margins of the notch ; and partly of a superficial bundle from the cotyloid ligament (g). Beneath it is an aperture by which vessels and nerves enter the acetabulum to supply the synovial membrane and the fat in the bottom of that hollow. The interarticular ligament (ligamentum teres ; fig. 202, b) is a band about an inch long, but of very variable thickness, which con- nects the head of the femur with the hip-bone. The ligament has a triangular form, the apex of the triangle being fixed to the pit on the head of the femur, and the base joining the transverse ligament. The free sides of the triangle are formed by two fibrous bundles, an anterior or pubic (c), which is attached with the transverse ligament to the pubic edge of the cotyloid notch, and a posterior or ischial (d), which is stronger, and is inserted beneath the transverse ligament into the ischial border of the notch. To see the condition of the interarticular ligament in the different movements of the joint, it should be examined in a specimen in which the capsule is entire, and the floor of the acetabulum has been cut out with a chisel from inside the pelvis. During extension of the joint the ligament is relaxed; and it cannot be tightened so long as the fully extended position is main- tained. In flexion of the joint the ligament is rendered somewhat tighter; but it is only fully stretched when, with the joint bent, the femur is adducted or rotated out : the pubic fasciculus of the band is especially tightened by the adduction, and the ischial slip by the outward rotation. A synovial membrane lines the capsular ligament, and is continued along the neck of the femur to the margin of the articular surface. In the bottom of the cotyloid cavity it is reflected over the fat in that situation ; and it surrounds the ligamentum teres. Dissection. To see the surface of the acetabulum, the lower limb is to be separated from the trunk by dividing the interarticular lio-ament, and by cutting through any parts that connect it to the pelvis : at this stage the pelvic attachments of the interarticular ligament can be better displayed.MOVEMENTS OF HIP-JOINT.

In the hollow of the cartilage, and close to the notch, is a mass of Pat iu the fat (fig. 186, /) covering about one-third of the area of the cotyloid bottom- cavity, which constitutes the gland of Havers : it communicates with the fat of the thigh beneath the transverse ligament. Movements. In this ball and socket joint, there are the same kinds Kinds of of movement as in the shoulder, viz., flexion and extension, abduc- tion and adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion and extension. In the swinging movement flexion is freer Swinging than extension, the thigh being capable of such elevation as to touch IU0Vemen, the belly. While swinging, the head of the femur revolves in the bottom of motion of the acetabulum, rotating around a horizontal axis ; and the rapidity femur; and extent of the movements do not endanger the security of the joint, the head of the bone not having any tendency to escape. * Hip-joint opened, to show the interarticular ligament, a.

Lateral movement motion of the head; state of the ligaments. Dislocation in lateral movements. Circum- duction. Rotation inwards, and out- wards. Examine attachment of muscles. In extension the strong ilio-femoral ligament (the inner hand especially) is tightened, and stops the movement. Flexion is not naturally arrested by the ligaments of the joint, hut hy the meeting of the soft parts of the thigh and abdomen. In abduction and adduction the femur is removed from, or brought towards, the middle line of the body. Of the two, abduction is the more extensive, because the limb may soon meet its fellow when it is moved inwards, though, if it is carried in front of the other, adduction is considerable. In both states the head moves in the opposite direction to the shaft. Thus, as the femur is abducted, the head descends, and a great part of the articular surface projects below the acetabulum; and when the limb is raised to its utmost, the upper edge of the neck meets the edge of the acetabulum, so as to prevent farther motion. As the limb descends and approaches the other, the head rises into the socket of the joint, and is securely lodged, finally, in the deepest part of the cavity. In abduction, the pubo-femoral ligament and lower part of the capsule are tightened over the projecting head of the femur, the upper part being relaxed. And in adduction, the outer band of the ilio-femoral ligament is rendered tense and arrests the movement. Dislocation may take place in both these lateral movements, the edge of the cotyloid cavity serving as the fulcrum on which the femur can be lifted out of the hollow. In circumduction, the four kinds of angular motion above noticed take place in succession, viz., flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction ; and the limb describes a cone, the base of which is at its extremity, and apex at the centre of the head of the femur. This movement is less free than in the shoulder-joint. There are two kinds of rotation, internal aud external; in the former, the great toe is turned in ; and in the latter it is moved outwards. In rotation inwards, the head of the femur rolls backwards hori- zontally across the acetabulum, the great trochanter being put forwards ; and the shaft of the bone revolves around a line internal to it, which passes from the centre of the head to the inner condyle. During this movement the posterior half of the capsule is put on the stretch, and the anterior is relaxed. In rotation out, the head of the bone rolls forwards across the cotyloid cavity, and the great trochanter is brought backwards. The outer band of the ilio-femoral ligament is tightened and checks the movement. Dissection. After the limb is removed, the attachments of all the muscles in the thigh are to be examined more minutely before the dissection of the leg is undertaken. The muscles should not be removed from the femur, but about two inches of each should be left for after study.659 SUPERFICIAL MARKINGS OF LEG. Section IV. THE BACK OF THE LEG. Directions. Before the dissection of the leg is begun, the student Surface- .should make himself acquainted, as in the thigh, with the promi- markms- nences of bone and muscle on the surface, and with the markings which indicate the position of the larger vessels. Prominences of bone. The bones of the leg can be traced beneath In the leg the skin from the knee to the ankle-joint. At the inner and fore 8Upernda{ part is the tibia, which is subcutaneous in all its extent, and is limited in front and behind by a sharp edge. Above, it presents in front a prominent tubercle into which the ligament of the patella is inserted; and on each side of this the tuberosities of the bone are super- ficial. The internal tuberosity is a uniform rounded prominence ; but the external forms a marked projection at the outer and fore part of the knee. Below, the tibia ends on the inner side of the ankle in the internal malleolar projection. On the outer side of the leg the lower half of the fibula may be felt with ease, but the upper half and the with more difficulty in consequence of the prominence of the muscles p^j?a 'n of the calf. The head of this bone may be recognized below the knee; and the lower end forma the eminence (malleolus) on the outer side of the ankle-joint. At the sides of the ankle are the prominent malleoli, the external Ankle-joint, being nearer to the heel; and when the joint is extended, the head of the astragalus can be felt below the tibia. Muscles and vessels of the leg. On the back of the leg is the swell Behind are of the calf: this is formed by the superficial muscles, and from it ^of the descends the firm band of the tendo Achillis, by which those t a muscles are connected with the heel. Between the tendon and the Achillis, edge of the tibia, but nearer the former, is placed the superficial vessels!8,1 part of the posterior tibial artery. In front, between th tibia and fibula are the flexor muscles of the ankle and the extensors of the toes, amongst which the anterior tibial artery lies deeply; the posi- Ljne of tion of the vessel will be indicated by a line from a point midway ^*|rlior between the head of the fibula and the projection of the external vessels, tuberosity of the tibia to the centre of the ankle-joint. Prominences of the foot. At the inner border of the foot, about an inner inch and a half in front of the internal malleolus, is the tuberosity {^footf of the navicular bone pointing out the spot at which an amputation °° " (Chopart's) is practised ; while one inch and a half farther forwards is a slight depression marking the articulation between the internal cuneiform and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. About the centre of the outer border of the foot is the tuberosity of the fifth Outer metatarsal bone. A line over the dorsum of the foot, from the border- centre of the ankle-joint to the interval between the inner two toes, fr°™al will lie over the position of the main artery. " 0I/' Position.

For the removal of the skin, one cut may be made along the middle of the leg to the sole of the foot, where a trans- verse incision is to be carried over the heel. The two resulting flaps of skin may be raised,—the outer one as far as the fibula, and the other as far as the inner margin of the tibia. In the fat the cutaneous nerves and vessels are to be followed. On the inner side, close to the tibia, is the internal saphenous vein with the nerve of the same name, together with twigs of the internal cutaneous near the knee. In the centre of the leg lies the external saphenous vein, with the small sciatic nerve as its companion above, and the external saphenous nerve below the middle of the leg. On the outer side cutaneous offsets of the external popliteal nerve will be met with. The superficial fascia, or the fatty layer of the back of the leg, is least thick over the tibia. Along the line of the superficial vessels it may be separated into two layers. Superficial Veins. Two veins appear in the dissection of the back of the leg, which are named saphenous—inner and outer. The internal saphenous vein (fig. 204, d) begins in an arch on the dorsum of the foot (p. 682). Ascending along the leg in front of the inner ankle, and then behind the inner edge of the tibia, it reaches the thigh (p. 602). In the leg the vein is joined by super- ficial branches, and by deep roots from the tibial veins. The external saphenous vein (fig. 203, c) begins at the outer end of the arch on the dorsum of the foot, and appears below the outer ankle. The vein then courses along the back of the leg to the ham, where it ends in the popliteal vein. It receives large branches about the heel, and others on the back of the leg, communicating with the internal saphenous. Cutaneous arteries accompany the superficial veins and nerves of the leg. Cutaneous Nerves (fig. 203). The nerves in the fat of the back of the leg are prolongations of branches already met with, viz., the internal and external saphenous, external popliteal, small sciatic, and internal cutaneous of the thigh. The internal saphenous nerve (fig. 203,") accompanies the vein of the same name beyond the knee (p. 623), and terminates at the middle of the inner border of the foot. In the leg the nerve gives off lateral cutaneous offsets, the largest of which turn over the tibia to the anterior aspect. The external or short saphenous nerve (fig. 203,5) is formed by the union of the tibial and peroneal communicating branches (p. 649), usually about the middle of the leg. It runs with the external saphenous vein below the outer ankle, and ends by supply- ing the outer side of the foot and little toe. It furnishes twigs to the skin of the lower part of the back of the leg, and large branches over the heel. Cutaneous nerves of the external popliteal.

Offset of the internal cutaneous ( fig. 203,s). The posterior branch of the internal cutaneous of the thigh (p. 604) extends to the middle of the leg, and communicates with the internal saphenous nerve. Dissection. The deep fascia will be seen by removing the fat. The superficial vessels and nerves may be either cut or turned aside. The deep fascia on the posterior aspect of the leg covers the muscles, and sends a thick process between the deep and superficial groups. Above, it is continuous with the investing membrane of the thigh, and receives offsets from the tendons about the knee ; and below, it joins the annular ligaments. Internally, it is fixed to the edge of the tibia : externally, it is continued uninterruptedly from the one aspect of the limb to the other; but from its deep surface an intermuscular septum is sent inwards between the muscles of the back and of the outer side of the leg to be attached to the outer border of the fibula. Veins are transmitted through it from the deep to the superficial vessels. Dissection. The fascia is to be divided along the centre of the leg as far as the heel, and is to be taken from the surface of the gastrocnemius muscle. By fixing with a stitch the inner cut head of the gastrocnemius, the fibres of the muscle will be more easily cleaned. Superficial Group of Muscles. In the calf of the leg there are three muscles, gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris, which extend the ankle. The first two are large, giving rise to the prominence on the surface, and end below by a common tendon ; but the last is inconsiderable in size, and chiefly tendinous. The gastrocnemius (fig. 203, a), the most superficial muscle, has two distinct pieces or heads, which arise from the lower end of the femur. The inner head of origin is attached by a large tendon to an impression at the upper aspect of the inner condyle, behind the insertion of the adductor magnus ; and by short tendinous fibres to the line above the condyle. The outer head is similarly fixed by tendon to a pit on the outer surface of the corresponding condyle, above the attachment of the popliteus muscle, and to the posterior surface of the bone immediately above the condyle. The fleshy fibres of the two heads are xuiited along the middle line by a narrow thin aponeurosis, and terminate below with the soleus in the common tendon of insertion. One surface is covered by the fascia. The other is in contact with the soleus and plantaris, and with the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve. The heads, by which the muscle arises, assist to form the lateral boundaries of the popliteal space, and ai'e crossed by the tendons of the hamstrings. The inner head is larger, and descends lower than the outer. In the outer head a piece of fibro-cartilage or a sesamoid bone may exist.663 SUPERFICIAL EXTENSORS OF ANKLE. Action. When the foot is unsupported, the gastrocnemius extends ™et™£tUe the ankle; and when the toes rest on the ground, it raises the os ^ ^. calcis and the weight of the body, as in standing on the toes, and in progression. Takincr its fixed point at the os calcis, the muscle draws down acting from ■■•"*"-"io J- ... below, the femur so as to bend the knee-jomt. Dissection. To see the soleus, the gastrocnemius is to be reflected Detach by cutting across the remaining head (fig. 204), and the vessels and f^uJ.0CUe~ nerves it receives. After the muscle has been thrown down, the soleus and plantaris must be cleaned. The soleus (fig. 204, b) is a large flat muscle, which is attached Soleus is to both bones of the leg. It arises from the head, and the upper the bones ° third of the posterior surface of the shaft of the fibula; from the of the leg, oblique line across the tibia, and from the inner edge of this bone as low as the middle ; and between the bones from an aponeurotic and joins arch over the large blood-vessels. Its fibres are directed downwards ?don to the common tendon. The superficial surface of the soleus is in contact with the gastro- parts over cnemius ; and where the two touch they are aponeurotic. Beneath andunder the soleus lie the bones of the leg, the deep muscles, and the vessels it; and nerves. Action. In its action on the foot the soleus, like the gastro- use, cnemius, extends the ankle and points the toes when the foot is ^eeefoot free to move ; and raises the heel if the toes rest on the ground. and jjxe)j. By the sudden and powerful contraction of the fibres of both muscles the common tendon is sometimes broken across. If it acts from the os calcis, it will draw back the bones of the acting from leg into a vertical position over the foot, as the body is raised to be ow" the erect posture after stooping. Tbndo Achillis (fie. 204, p). The common tendon of the gastro- Tendo . Achillis • cnemius and soleus is one of the strongest in the body. About three inches wide above, it commences at the middle of the leg, though extent' it receives fleshy fibres on the under surface nearly to the lower end: below, it is narrowed, and is inserted into the middle impression and i«ser- on the posterior aspect of the tuberosity of the os calcis. A bursa intervenes between it and the upper part of the tuberosity. The tendon is close beneath the fascia; and the external saphenous vein and nerve are superficial to it at first, but afterwards lie along its outer border. The plantaris (fig. 204, c) is remarkable in having the longest Plantaris: tendon in the body, which takes the appearance of a riband when it is stretched laterally. About three-quarters of an inch wide, the origin; muscle arises from the line above the outer condyle of the femur, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and the tendon is inserted into the os calcis with, or by the side of, the tendo insertion; Achillis, or into the fascia of the leg. The belly of the muscle, about three inches in length, is concealed j^*'0" of by the gastrocnemius, but the tendon appears on the inner side of 16 m"SC e' the tendo Achillis about the middle of the leg. This little muscle crosses the popliteal vessels, and lies on the soleus.DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 664 use like gastrocne- mius. Detach soleus, aud clean the <leei> fascia.

The soleus is to be detached from the bones of the leg, and the muscles and nerves entering it are to be divided; but in raising it, the student should take care not to injure the thin deep fascia and the vessels and nerves beneath. The superficial muscles may be next removed by cutting through their tendons near the os calcis; and the bursa between the tendo Achillis and the os calcis should be opened. The piece of fascia between the muscles of the superficial and deep groups is then to be cleaned ; and the integuments between the inner ankle and the heel are to be taken away to lay bare the annular ligament, but a cutaneous nerve to the sole of the foot, which pierces the ligament, is to be preserved. Deep part of the fascia. This intermuscular piece of the fascia of the leg is fixed to the tibia and fibula, and binds down the flexor muscles of the deep group. In the upper part of the leg it is thin and indistinct ; but lower in the limb it is much stronger, and is marked by some transverse fibres near the malleoli, which give it the appearance and office of an annular ligament in that situa- tion. Inferiorly it joins the internal annular ligament between the heel and the inner ankle. Dissection. The deep layer of muscles, the posterior tibial nerve, and the trunk and offsets of the posterior tibial vessels will be laid bare by the removal of the fascia and the areolar tissue. A muscle between the bones (tibialis posticus) is partly concealed by an aponeurosis which gives origin to the two lateral muscles (flexor digitorum and flexor hallucis) ; and it will not fully appear until after the membrane covering it has been divided longitudinally, and reflected to the sides. To prepare the peroneal artery, evert and partly divide the flexor hallucis, by which it is concealed ; then define branches from its lower part to the front of the leg, the outer side of the foot, and to join the posterior tibial artery. Deep Group of Muscles (fig. 205). The deep muscles at the back of the leg are four in number, viz., popliteus, flexor longus hallucis, flexor longus digitorum, and tibialis posticus. The first of these is close to the knee-joint; it crosses the bones, and is covered by a special aponeurosis. The flexors lie on the bones, the one of the great toe resting on the fibula, and that of the other toes on the tibia. And the tibialis covers the interosseous membrane. With the exception of the popliteus, all enter the sole of the foot; and they have a fleshy part parallel to the bones of the leg, and a tendi- nous part beneath the tarsus. The popliteus (fig. 205, a) arises by tendon, within the capsule of the knee-joint, from the front of an oblong depression on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur ; and external to the capsule of the joint, some fleshy fibres arise from the posterior ligament. The muscular fibres spread out, and are inserted into the665 DEEP MUSCLES OF BACK. parts around it. Use with tibia free ; special function. tibia above the oblique line on the posterior surface, as well as into into tibia; tbe aponeurosis covering tbem. The muscle rests on the tibia, and is covered by a fascia derived in great part from the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle: on it lie Fig. 205.* the popliteal vessels and nerve, and the gastrocnemius and plantaris. Along the upper border are the lower articu- lar vessels and nerve of the inner side of the knee; and the lower border corresponds with the attachment of the soleus on the tibia. The tendon of origin will be seen in the dissection of the ligaments of the knee-joint. Action. The leg being free, the muscle bends the knee-joint, and then rotates inwards the tibia. The po- pliteus is used especially in beginning the act of flexing the knee, as it pro- duces the rotation inwards of the tibia (or outwards of the femur) without which that movement cannot take place. The FLEXOR LONGUS HALLUCIS (flex. long, pollicis pedis ; fig. 205, f) arises below the soleus from the lower two- thirds of the posterior surface of the fibula ; from the' intermuscular septum between it and the peronei muscles ; and from the aponeurosis over the tibialis. Inferiorly the tendon of the muscle enters a groove in the astra- galus, and crosses the sole of the foot to its insertion into the great toe. Above, the muscle is covered by ( \ ^BIIiifSlE^r'' relations; the soleus; but below, it is super- ficial, and is in contact with the fascia. It lies on the fibula and lower end of the tibia, and conceals the peroneal vessels. Along the inner side are the posterior tibial nerve and vessels; and contiguous to the outer margin, but separated by fascia, are the peronei muscles. * Deep dissection of the back of the leg (Illustrations of Dissections).

Tibialis posticus : origin ; insertion; muscles and vessels in relation with it; use, with foot free, and fixed ; in standing, in rising up. Action. The foot being unsupported, the flexor bends the last phalanx of the great toe, and then extends the ankle. The foot resting on the ground, the muscle raises the heel; and it moves back the fibula as the body rises from stooping. The flexor longus digitorum (flex, perforans ; fig. 205, e) arises from the inner division of the posterior surface of the tibia, extend- ing from the attachment of the soleus to about three inches from the lower extremity ; and from the aponeurosis covering the tibialis posticus. Its tendon enters a compartment in the annular liga- ment, which is external to the sheath of the tibiaus ; and it divides in the sole of the feet into tendons for the last phalanges of the four outer toes. The muscle is narrow and pointed above, where it is placed be- neath the soleus; but in the lower half it is in contact with the fascia, and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve lie on it. The deep surface rests on the tibia and the tibialis posticus. Action. The muscle bends the farthest phalangeal joints of the four smaller toes, and then extends the ankle. If the toes are in contact with the ground, the flexor helps to raise the heel in walking ; and to move back the tibia in the act of rising from stooping. The tibialis posticus (fig. 205, d) occupies the interval between the bones of the leg, but it crosses over the tibia below to reach the inner side of the foot. The muscle arises from the interosseous membrane, except about one inch below, from an impression along the outer part of the posterior surface of the tibia extending from the external tuberosity to the middle of the bone, from the inner surface of the shaft of the fibula, and slightly from the aponeurosis covering it. In the lower part of the leg the muscle is directed be- neath the flexor digitorum; and its tendon, entering the inner space in the annular ligament, reaches the inner side of the foot to be inserted into the navicular and other bones (p. 681). The tibialis is concealed by the aponeurosis before mentioned, and is overlapped by the neighbouring muscles ; but in the lower part of the leg it is placed between the tibia and the long flexor of the toes. On the muscle are the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. The upper end presents two pointed processes of attach- ment—that to the tibia being the higher—between which the anterior tibial vessels are directed forwards. Action. Its action on the moveable foot is to depress the fore part and outer side, and carry the toes inwards, producing the move- ment in the tarsal joints known as inversion (p. 704), and to ex- tend the ankle-joint. The toes resting on the ground, it will aid the muscles of the calf in raising the heel in the ]3rogression of the body. In standing, the muscle can raise the inner border of the foot with the tibialis anticus, so as to throw the weight of the body on the outer edge. ' As the body rises from stooping, the tibialis draws back the bones of the leg, with the soleus.POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 667 The aponeurosis covering the tibialis is attached externally to the ^°n^osis inner border of the fibula ; but internally it joins the flexor longus muscle, digitorum without being attached to bone : it may be regarded as con- stituting a fibular origin of that muscle. Fibres of the flexor longus hallucis arise from one surface of the membrane, and of the tibialis posticus from the other. The POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY (fig. 205, e) is One Of the vessels Posterior resulting from the bifurcation of the popliteal trunk (p. 646). It artery: extends from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the lower extent; edge of the internal annular ligament, where it ends in two plantar branches for the sole of the foot. At its origin the artery lies midway between the tibia and fibula, course; but as it approaches the lower part of the leg it gradually inclines inwards ; and at its termination it is placed below the tibia, in the centre of the hollow between the heel and the inner ankle. For the upper two-thirds of the leg the vessel is concealed parts cover- by two muscles of the calf, viz., gastrocnemius and soleus ; but and beiowT in the lower third, as it lies between the tendo Achillis and the inner edge of the tibia, it is covered only by the integuments and the deep fascia. At its termination it is placed beneath the annular ligament. For its upper half the trunk lies over the tibialis posticus, but afterwards on the flexor digitorum, and on the parts be- lower end of the tibia and the ankle-joint. On the outer side is neatU lfc: the flexor hallucis. Between the heel and the ankle, the artery is placed between the under tendons of the common flexor of the digits and special flexor of the lament • great toe. Venae comites closely surround the vessel. The posterior tibial veins; nerve is at first internal to the artery ; but at the distance of about nerve; an inch it crosses to the outer side, and retains that position throughout. This artery supplies branches to the muscles and the tibia, and a branches :— large peroneal trunk to the outer side of the leg. a. Muscular branches enter the deep layer of muscles, and the Muscular, soleus ; and an offset from the branch to the soleus pierces the attach- ment of that muscle to the tibia, and ascends to the knee-joint. 6.

The peroneal artery (fig. 205, g) is often as large as the pos- terior tibial, and arises from that vessel about one inch from the beginning. It takes the fibula as its guide, and lying close to that bone in a fibrous canal between the origins of the flexor longus hallucis and tibialis posticus, reaches the lower part of the inter-, osseous membrane. At this spot it sends forwards a branch to the front of the leg (anterior peroneal); and it is directed onwards over the articulation between the tibia and fibula to the outer side of the heel (h), where it terminates in. branches, which anastomose with offsets of the tarsal and external plantar arteries.

Besides the anterior peroneal, it furnishes muscular, medullary and communicating offsets. a.

The anterior peroneal branch passes forwards through an open- ing below the interosseous membrane, and is continued to the dorsum and outer part of the foot; on the front of the leg and foot it anastomoses with the external malleolar and tarsal branches of the anterior tibial artery. d. A communicating offset near the ankle joins in an arch with a similar branch of the posterior tibial. Substitu- tions. Posterior tibial veins. Posterior tibial nerve extent; and rela- tions ; Peculiarities. The anterior brancb of the peroneal may take the place of the anterior tibial artery on the dorsum of the foot. A compensating principle may be observed amongst the arteries of the foot, as in those of the hand, by which the deficiency in one is supplied by an en- larged offset of another. The posterior tibial veins begin at the inner side of the foot by the union of the plantar : they ascend, one on each side of the artery, and unite with the anterior tibial at the lower border of the popliteus to form the large popliteal vein. They receive the peroneal veins, and branches corresponding with the offsets of the artery: branches connect them with the saphenous veins. The posterior tibial nerve (fig. 205,3), a continuation of the internal popliteal (p. 649), reaches like the artery from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the interval between the os calcis and the inner malleolus. While beneath the annular ligament, or somewhat higher than it, the nerve divides into the internal and ex- ternal plantar branches of the foot. Its relations to surrounding muscles are the same as those of the669 INTERNAL ANNULAR LIGAMENT. artery; but its position to the vessel changes, for it lies on the inner side above the origin of the peroneal offset, but thence to the termination, on the outer side. Its branches are muscular and branches cutaneous. Muscular branches are furnished to the two long flexors, the tibi- to muscles, alis posticus, and the soleus. There is an offset for each of the muscles ; and they may arise either separately along the trunk, or together from the upper end of the nerve. The branch to the tibialis is the largest; and that to the flexor hallucis lies on the peroneal artery. A cutaneous nerve of the sole of the foot (calcaneo-plantar ; fig. 205,4) q"^*1"" begins above the ankle, and piercing the internal annular ligament and sole, as two or more pieces, ends in the integuments of the inner and under parts of the heel: this nerve will be followed to its termina- tion in the dissection of the foot (fig. 206). The internal annular ligament stretches between the heel and Internal the inner ankle, and serves to confine the tendons of the deep layer of ligament : muscles of the foot and toes. Attached by a narrow part to the internal malleolus, the fibres diverge, and are inserted into the os calcis. One border (upper) is continuous with the fascia of the attaeh- leg; and the opposite gives attachment to the abductor hallucis ments- muscle of the foot. Beneath it are sheaths for the tendons. The innermost encloses Sheaths : the tibialis posticus, lodged in a groove on the back of the malleolus, their Immediately outside this is another space for the flexor digitorum. p0S1 10n' And about three-quarters of an inch nearer the os calcis is the flexor hallucis, resting in a groove in the astragalus. Each sheath is lined by a synovial membrane. Between the tendons of the two flexors of the digits are placed the tibial vessels and nerve. Section V. SOLE OF THE FOOT. Position.

Afterwards the skin is to be removed from each toe, and the digital vessels and nerves on the sides are to be dissected out at the same time. In the fat near the heel the student should follow the cutaneous and dissect nerve of the sole (fig. 206); and he may trace out, at a little dis- cu,;ane°»!j670 DISSECTION OP THE FOOT.

The subcutaneous fat is very abundant, and forms a thick cushion over the parts that press most on the ground in standing, viz., over the os calcis, and the metatarso-phalangeal articulations. Dissection. The fat shoidd now be removed, and the plantar fascia laid bare. Begmning the dissection near the heel, follow forwards the fascia towards the toes, to each of which a process is to be traced. In the intervals between the processes the digital nerves and arteries will be detected amongst much fatty and fibrous tissues ; but the vessels and nerves to the inner side of the great toe and outer side of the little, toe pierce the fascia farther back than the rest. The student is next to define a transverse fibrous band across the toes, over the digital vessels and nerves ; and when this has been displayed, he may remove the superficial fascia from the toes to see the sheaths of the tendons. Plantar fascia. The special fascia of the sole of the foot is of a pearly white colour and great strength, and sends septa between the muscles. Its thickness varies in different parts of the foot; and from this circumstance, and the existence of longitudinal depressions over the two chief intermuscidar septa, the fascia is divided into a central and two lateral pieces. The central part, which is much the thickest, is pointed at its attachment to the os calcis, but widens and becomes thinner as it extends forwards. A slight depression, corresponding with an intermuscular septum, marks its limit on each side ; and opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones it divides into five processes, which send fibres to the integuments near the web of the foot, and are continued onwards to the toes, one to each. "Where the pieces separate from each other, the digital vessels and nerves, and the lumbricales muscles become superficial, and are arched over by transverse fibres. If one of the digital processes be divided longitudinally, and its parts reflected to the sides, it will be seen to join the sheath of the flexor tendons, and to be fixed laterally into the margins of the metatarsal bone, and into the transverse metatarsal ligament. The lateral pieces of the fascia are thinner than the central one. On the inner margin of the foot the fascia has but little strength, and is continued to the dorsum ; but on the outer side it presents a strong band between the os calcis and the projection of the fifth metatarsal bone. Dissection. To examine the septa, a longitudinal incision may be made along the middle of the foot through the central piece of the fascia, and a transverse one near the calcaneum. On detaching the fascia from the subjacent flexor brevis digitorum, by carrying the scalpel from before backwards, the septal processes will appear on the sides of that muscle. The intermuscular septa pass deeply on the sides of the flexor brevis digitorum, and a piece of fascia reaches across the foot fromFIRST LAYER OF MUSCLES. 671 one septum to the other, beneath that flexor, so as to isolate it. The inner septum separates the short flexor from the abductor hallucis ; and the outer, from the abductor minimi digiti. The superficial transverse ligament crosses the roots of the toes, Transverse^ and is contained in the skin forming the rudimentary web of the the toes. foot. It is attached at the ends to the sheath of the flexor tendons of the great and little toes, and is connected with the sheaths of the others as it lies over them. Beneath it the digital nerves and vessels issue. The sheaths of the flexor tendons (fig. 207, g) are similar to those Sheaths of of the fingers, though not so distinct, and serve to confine the ten" tendons against the grooved bones. The sheath is weak opposite the articulations between the phalanges, but is strong opposite the centre of both the metatarsal and the next phalanx. Each is lubri- cated by a synovial membrane, and contains the tendons of the long and short flexor muscles. Dissection (fig. 206). In the sole of the foot the muscles are Dissect first numerous, and have been arranged in four layers. To prepare the muscles, first layer all the fascia must be taken away ; but this dissection must be made with some care, lest the digital nerves and vessels, which become superficial to the central muscle towards the toes, should be injured. The tendons of the short flexor muscle are to be followed to the toes, and one or more of the sheaths in which they are contained should be opened. First Layer of Muscles. In this layer are three muscles, viz., Muscles in the flexor brevis digitorum, the abductor hallucis, and abductor minimi iayei.. digiti. The short flexor of the toes lies in the centre of the foot; and each of the others is in a line with the toe on which it acts. The abductor hallucis (abd. pollicis pedis ; fig. 206, a), the j^uctor most internal muscle of the superficial layer, takes oriqin from the . . r J a origin; inner side of the larger tubercle on the under surface of the os calcis, from the plantar fascia, from the lower border of the internal annular ligament, and from the internal intermuscular septum. In front, the muscle ends in a tendon, which is joined by fibres of the short flexor, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the insertion; metatarsal phalanx of the great toe. The cutaneous surface of the muscle is in contact with the relations; plantar fascia; and the other touches the tendons of the tibial muscles, the plantar vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the long flexors of the toes, with the accessorius muscle. Action. This abductor acts chiefly as a flexor of the metatarso- use, as phalangeal joint of the great toe, but it will slightly abduct that abductor toe from the others. The plexor brevis digitorum (flexor perforatus ; fig. 206, b) Flexor arises posteriorly by a pointed process from the fore part of the torumdi8'" larger tubercle of the os calcis, and from the plantar fascia and the septa. About the centre of the foot the muscle divides into four slips, which become tendinous and are directed forwards over the tendons of the long flexor to enter the sheaths of the four smaller672 DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. divides into tendons for four toes; insertion; relations ; and nse.

Branches to muscles ; toes, where they are inserted into the middle phalanges. In the sheath of the toe the tendon of this muscle lies at first (in this position of the foot) on the long flexor; opposite the centre of the metatarsal phalanx it is slit for the passage of the other, and it is attached by two processes to the sides of the middle phalanx. The short flexor of the toes is contained in a sheath of the plantar fascia, and occupies the middle of the foot. It conceals the tendon of the long flexor of the toes, the accessory muscle, and the external plantar vessels and nerve. Action. It bends the first and second phalangeal joints of the four smaller toes, like the flexor sublimis in the upper limb, and approximates the toes at same time. The abductor minimi digiti (fig. 206, c) has a wide origin behind from the small outer tubercle of the os calcis, from the adjacent part of the inner tubercle, and from the plantar fascia and the external in- termuscular septum. It ends anteriorly in a tendon which is inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the little toe. The muscle lies along the outer border of the foot, and conceals the flexor accessorius, and the tendon of the peroneus longus. On its inner side are the external plantar vessels and nerves. Sometimes a part of the muscle is fixed into the projection of the fifth meta- tarsal bone. Action. Though it can abduct the little toe from the others, as the name signifies, its chief use is to bend the metatarso-phalangeal joint. Dissection. To bring into view the second layer of muscles and the plantar vessels and nerves, the muscles already examined must be reflected (fig. 207). Cut through the flexor perforates at the os calcis, and as it is raised, notice a branch of nerve and artery to it. Dividing the abductor minimi digiti near its origin, and turning it to the outer side of the foot, seek its nerve and vessel close to the calcaneum. The abductor hallucis can be drawn aside if it is necessary, but it may remain uncut till afterwards. Next, the internal plantar vessels and nerve are to be followed forwards to their termination, and backwards to their origin ; and the external plantar vessels and nerve, the tendons of the long flexors of the toes, the accessory muscle, and the small lumbricales, should be freed from fat. The Plantar Arteries (fig. 207) are the terminal branches of the posterior tibial trunk, and supply digital offsets to the toes. They are two in number, and are named external and internal from their relative position in the sole of the foot. Of the two, the external is the larger, and forms the plantar arch. The internal artery (a) is inconsiderable in size, and accom- panies the internal plantar nerve, under cover of the abductor hallucis, as far as the middle of the foot, where it ends in four super- ficial digital branches.

Internal nerve to three toes and a half; muscular branches; digital nerves are divided, ex- cept first, and give muscular branches, cutaneous and articu- lar offsel s. The external artery (b) takes an arched course in the foot, with the concavity of the arch turned inwards. The vessel is first directed outwards across the sole, and then obliquely inwards towards the root of the great toe, so that it crosses the foot twice. In the first half of its extent, viz., from the inner side of the cal- caneum to the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, the artery is comparatively superficial; in the other half, between the little and the great toe, it lies deeply in the foot, and forms the plantar arch. Only the first part of the artery is now laid bare ; the remaining portion, supplying the digital branches, will be noticed after the examination of the third layer of muscles (p. 679). As far as the metatarsal bone of the little toe, the vessel is concealed by the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum ; but for a short distance near its termination it lies in the interval between the last muscle and the abductor minimi digiti. In this extent it is placed on the os calcis, and the flexor accessorius ; and it is accompanied by venae comites, and the external plantar nerve. Branches. From the beginning of the artery two or three internal calcaneal branches arise. They perforate the origin of the abductor hallucis, and ramify over the heel, anastomosing -with the terminal branches of the peroneal artery. Offsets are also furnished to the muscles between which it lies ; and others turn round the outer border of foot to anastomose with the tarsal and metatarsal arteries. The Plantar Nerves (fig. 207) are derived from the bifurcation of the posteror tibial trunk behind the inner ankle. They are two in number, like the arteries, and have the same anatomy as those vessels, for each accompanies a plantar artery ; but the larger nerve lies with the smaller blood-vessel. The internal plantar nerve (*) courses between the short flexor of the toes and the abductor hallucis, and giving but few muscular offsets, divides into four digital branches (fig. 206, 2, 3, 4, 5) for the supply of both sides of the inner three toes, and half the fourth ; it resembles thus the median nerve of the hand in the distribution of its branches. Muscular offsets are given by the trunk to the short flexor of the toes (perforatus) and the abductor hallucis; and a few superficial twigs perforate the fascia. The four digital nerves have a numerical designation, and the first is nearest the inner border of the foot. The branch (2) to the inner side of the great toe is undivided, but the others are bifurcated at the cleft between the toes. Muscular branches are furnished by two of these nerves before they reach the toes ; thus, the first (most internal) supplies the flexor brevis hallucis ; and the second gives a branch to the innermost lumbrical muscle. _ Digital nerves on the toes. Each of the outer three nerves, being divided at the spot mentioned, supplies the contiguous sides of two toes, while the first belongs altogether to the inner side of the great675 EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE. toe ; all give offsets to the integuments, and the cutis beneath the nail, and articular filaments are distributed to the joints as in the fingers. The external plantar nerve (fig. 207,2) is spent chiefly in the Exte™a|o deep muscles of the sole of the foot, but it furnishes digital nerves £naentoeand to both sides of the little toe, and the outer side of the next. It a half; corresponds in its distribution with the ulnar nerve in the hand. It has the same course as the external plantar artery, and divides jJa?a^P^r" at the outer margin of the flexor brevis digitorum into a superficial deep parts; and a deep portion ;—the former gives origin to two digital nerves ; but the latter accompanies the arch of the plantar artery into the foot, and will be dissected afterwards (p 680). While the external plantar nerve is concealed by the short flexor J^^8.*0 of the toes, it gives muscular branches to the abductor minimi digiti and the flexor accessorius. The digital branches of the external plantar nerve (fig. 206) are b^nch^s*1 two. One (') is undivided ; it is distributed to the outer side of ' the little toe, and gives offsets to the flexor brevis minimi digiti, °ne sme e' and oftentimes to the interosseous muscles of the fourth space. The other (8) bifurcates at the cleft between the outer two toes, and one divided, supplies their collateral surfaces: this nerve communicates in the foot with the last digital branch of the internal plantar nerve. On the sides of the toes the digital nerves have the same dis- distribution tribution as those from the other plantar trunk, and end like them like ot er8' in a tuft of fine branches at the extremity of the digit. Dissection (fig. 207). To complete the preparation of the second Lay bare layer of muscles, the abductor hallucis should be detached from the layer of os calcis, and the muscle should be turned inwards. The internal muscles, plantar nerve and artery, and the superficial portion of the external plantar nerve, are to be cut across and thrown forwards ; but the external plantar artery and the nerve with it are not to be injured. All the fat, and the loose tissue and fascia, are then to be taken away near the toes. Second Later op Muscles (fig. 207). In this layer are the Muscles of tendons of the two flexor muscles at the back of the leg, viz., flexor iayerld longus digitorum and flexor longus hallucis, which cross one another. Connected with the former, soon after it enters the foot, is an accessory muscle; and at its division into pieces four fleshy slips (lumbricales) are added to it. The tendon of the flexor longus digitorum (fig. 207, b), while Tendon of entering the foot beneath the annular ligament, lies on the internal of'toe"0^ lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. In the foot it is directed obliquely towards the centre, where it is joined by the accessory divides into muscle and a slip from the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, and fow : divides into tendons for the four outer toes. Each tendon enters the sheath of the toe with and beneath a these pierce tendon from the flexor brevis (e). About the centre of the meta- tendons" tarsal phalanx the tendon of the long flexor (f) is transmitted ° ' through the other, and passes onwards to be inserted into the base of the ungual phalanx. Uniting the flexor tendons with the two short folds x x 2 *° tendonsDISSECTION OF THE FOOT. nearest phalanges of the toes are short synovial folds, one to each, as in the hand ; and the one fixing the flexor perforans is anterior (p. 300). Action. It flexes the last phalangeal joint, and combines with the short flexor in bending the first and second joints. If it acted by itself it would tend to bring the toes somewhat inwards, in con- sequence of its oblique position in the foot. The lumbricales (fig. 207, d) are four small muscles between the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum. Each arises from two tendons with the exception of the most internal, and this is con- nected with the inner side of the tendon to the second toe. Be- coming tendinous, they pass upwards on the tibial side of the four outer toes, and are inserted into the expansion of the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the first phalanx ; but they often end partially in an attachment to the side of the phalanx. The muscles decrease in size from the inner to the outer side of the foot. Action. These small muscles assist in flexing the metatarso- phalangeal joints ; and through their union with the long extensor tendon they may aid that muscle in straightening the two inter- phalangeal joints. The accessorius muscle (fig. 207, a) has two heads of origin :— One is mostly tendinous, and is attached to the outer surface of the os calcis, and to the long plantar ligament; the other is large and fleshy, and springs from the inner concave surface of the calcaneum. The fibres end in aponeurotic bands, which join the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum about the centre of the foot, and contribute slips to the pieces of that tendon going to the second, third and fourth digits (Turner). The muscle is bifurcated behind, and the heads of origin are separated by the long plantar ligament. On it lie the external plantar vessels and nerve ; and the muscles of the first layer conceal it. Action. By means of its offsets to the tendons of certain digits the muscle helps to bend those toes; and from its position on the outer side of, and behind the long flexor to which it is united, it will oppose the inward pull of that muscle, and enable it to bend the toes directly backwards. The tendon of the flexor longus hallucis (fig. 207, c) is deeper in the sole of the foot than the flexor longus digitorum: taking a straight course to the root of the great toe, it enters the digital sheath, to be inserted into the base of the ungual phalanx. It is united to the long flexor tendon by a strong tendinous process, which, joined by bands of the accessorius, is continued into the pieces of that tendon belonging to the second and third toes (Turner). Beneath the internal annular ligament this tendon lies in a groove on the back of the astragalus : in the foot it first occupies a similar groove on the under surface of the sustentaculum tali, and then lies- over the flexor brevis hallucis. Action. For the action of this muscle on the great toe, see page 666. Through the slip that it gives to the tendons of the commonTHIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. 677 flexor going to the second and third toes, it will bend those digits and other with the great toe. Dissection (fig. 208). For the dissection of the third layer of ^s|0^yer muscles, the accessorius and the tendons of the long flexors are ofmuseies. to be cut through near the calcaneum, and turned towards the toes. While raising the tendons, the external plantar nerve and artery are not to be interfered with ; and small nerves and vessels to the outer three lumbricales are to be looked for. Afterwards the areolar tissue is to be taken from the muscles now brought into view. Third Layer of Muscles (fig. 208). Only the short muscles of Muscles of the great and little toes enter into this layer. On the metatarsal thml layer* bone of the great toe the flexor brevis hallucis lies, and external to this is the adductor hallucis ; on the metatarsal bone of the little toe is placed the flexor brevis minimi digiti. Crossing the heads of the metatarsal bones is the transversus pedis muscle. The fleshy mass between the adductor hallucis and the short flexor of the little toe consists of the interosseous muscles of the next layer. The flexor brevis hallucis (flex. brev. pollicis pedis ; fig. 208, Flexor a) arises behind by two tendinous slips, one of which is fixed to the hallucis: inner side of the cuboid bone, while the other is prolonged from the origin; tendon of the tibialis posticus. Near the front of the first meta- tarsal bone the fleshy belly divides into two heads, which are inserted insertion; into the sides of the base of the metatarsal phalanx. Resting on the muscle at one part, and in the interval between relations; the heads at another, is the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. The inner head joins the abductor, and the outer is united with the adductor hallucis. A sesamoid bone is developed in the tendon connected with each head. Action. By its attachment to the first phalanx it flexes the meta- use. tarso-phalangeal joint of the big toe. The adductor hallucis (add. pollicis pedis; fig. 208, b), which Adductor is larger than the preceding muscle and external to it, arises from the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and from the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. Anteriorly the muscle is united with the outer head of the short flexor, and is inserted with it insertion; into the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the great toe. To the inner side is the flexor brevis; and beneath the outer relations; border the external plantar vessels and nerves are directed inwards. Action. Its first action will be to adduct the great toe to the use. others, and it will help afterwards in bending the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the toe. The transversus pedis (fig. 208, d) is placed transversely over Transversus! the heads of the metatarsal bones. Its origin is by fleshy bundles pedis: from the capsule of the metatarso-phalangeal articulations of the origin: three outer toes (frequently not from the little toe), and from the transverse metatarsal ligament.

Beneath the adductor lie the plantar arch and the external plantar nerve with their branches ; and through the first interosseous space the dorsal artery of the foot enters the sole. All these vessels and nerves, with their branches, require careful cleaning. The muscles projecting between the metatarsal bones are the interossei; the fascia covering them should be removed. The plantar arch (fig. 209, d) is the portion of the external °rf the plantar artery which reaches from the base of the metatarsal bone artery: of the little toe to the back of the first interosseous space : inter- extent; nally the arch is completed by a communicating branch from the dorsal artery of the foot (e; p. 680).

Dissect the last layer of muscles. Fourth layer of muscles. The last two are joined by superficial digital branches of the internal plantar at the root of the toes. On the sides of the toes the disposition of the arteries is like that of the digital in the hand. They extend to the end, where they unite in an arch, and give offsets to the sides and hall of the toe ; and the artery on the second digit anastomoses at the end of the toe with a branch from the anterior tibial artery. Near the front of both the metatarsal and the next phalanx, they form anastomotic loops beneath the flexor tendons, from which the phalangeal articu- lations are supplied. The dorsal artery op the foot (fig. 209, e) enters the sole at the posterior part of the first (inner) metatarsal space, and ends by inosculating with the plantar arch. By a large digital artery it furnishes branches to both sides of the great toe and half the next, in the same manner as the radial artery in the hand is distributed to one digit and a half. The digital branch (/) extends to the front of the first inter- osseous space, and divides into collateral branches (h) for the con- tiguous sides of the great toe and the next. Near the head of the metatarsal bone it sends inwards, beneath the flexor muscles, a digital branch (g) for the inner side of the great toe. The arteries have the same arrangement along the toes as the other digital branches ; and that to the second digit anastomoses at the end with a branch of the plantar arch. The deep part op the external plantar nerve (fig. 209, *) accompanies the arch of the artery, and ends internally in the ad- ductor hallucis. It furnishes branches to all the interossei, to the transversus pedis, and to the outer three lumbrical muscles (Brooks). This nerve corresponds with the deep portion of the ulnar nerve in the hand. Dissection. It will be needful to remove the transverse muscle, to see a ligament across the heads of the metatarsal bones. The transverse metatarsal ligament is a strong fibrous band, like that in the hand (p. 304), which connects together all the meta- tarsal bones at their anterior extremity. A thin fascia covering the interosseous muscles is attached to its hinder edge. It is con- cealed by the transversus pedis, and by the tendons, vessels, and nerves of the toes. Dissection. To complete the dissection of the last layer of muscles, the flexor brevis minimi digiti may be detached and thrown for- wards. Dividing then the metatarsal ligament between the bones, the knife is to be earned directly backwards for a short distance in the centre of each interosseous space, except the first, in order that the two interosseous muscles may be separated from each other. All the interossei are Aasible in the sole of the foot. The fascia covering the muscles should be taken away if any remains, and the branches of the external plantar nerve to them should be dissected out. Fourth Layer of Muscles (fig. 209). In the fourth and last layer of the foot are contained the interosseous muscles, and the tendons of the tibialis posticus and peroneus longua.FOURTH LAYER OF MUSCLES. 681 The interosseous muscles (fig. 209) are situate in the intervals Interossei. between the metatarsal bones : they consist of two sets, plantar and dorsal, like the interossei in the hand. Seven in number, there are three plantar and four dorsal; and two are found in each space, •except the innermost. The plantar muscles (o) belong to the outer three toes, and are Thr^ptan^ slender fleshy slips. Each arises from the under and inner surface outer toes, of the metatarsal bone ; and is inserted partly into the tibial side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the same toe, and partly by an expansion to the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the phalanx. These muscles are smaller than the dorsal, and are placed more in the sole of the foot. The dorsal muscles (i), one in each space, arise by two heads from ^e°t^°r^i1(, the lateral surfaces of the bones between which they lie ; and are bones. inserted like the others into the side, and on the dorsum of the meta- tarsal phalanx of certain toes :—Thus, the inner two muscles belong to the second toe, one to each side ; the next belongs to the outer side of the third toe ; and the remaining one to the outer side of the fourth toe. The interossei are crossed by the external plantar vessels and Relations, nerve, and their digital branches, and lie beneath the transversus pedis and the metatarsal ligament. The posterior perforating arteries pierce the hinder extremities of the dorsal set. Action.

Open also the fibrous sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, which crosses from the outer to the inner side of the foot. The tendon of the tibialis posticus is continued forwards over insertion of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint, and over the astra- tibialis pos- galo-navicular articulation, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the licus navievdar bone. From its insertion processes are continued to many of the other bones of the foot :—One is directed backwards to the into tarsus sustentaculum tab of the os calcis. Two offsets are directed for- wards ;—one to the internal cuneiform bone ; the other, much the largest, is attached to the middle and outer cuneiform, to the cuboid bone, and to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal !>«d mcta- bones.

The tendon of the peroneus longus muscle winds round the cuboid bone, and is continued inwards in the groove on the under surface, to be inserted into the internal cuneiform bone, and the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; and sometimes by a slip into the base of the second metatarsal bone. In the sole of the foot (fig. 209), it is contained in a sheath which is completed, towards the outer part, by the fibres of the long plantar ligament prolonged to the tarsal ends of the third and fourth meta- tarsal bones; but it is formed internally only by areolar tissue. A synovial membrane lubricates the sheath. Where the tendon turns round the cuboid bone it is thickened, and contains fibro-cartilage or a sesamoid bone. Section VI. THE FEONT OF THE LEG. Position of the limb. Raise the skin. Seek the cutaneous nerves in the leg; on the foot both vessels and nerves ; clean the fascia. Cutaneous veins: internal saphenous ; Position. The limb is to be raised to a convenient height by blocks beneath the knee, and the foot is to be extended in order that the muscles on the front of the leg may be put on the stretch. Dissection. To enable the dissector to raise the skin from the leg and foot, one incision should be made along the middle line from the knee to the toes, and this should be intersected by cross cuts at the ankle and the root of the toes. After the flaps of skin are reflected, the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be looked for. At the upper and inner part of the leg are some filaments from the great saphenous nerve ; and at the outer side others, still smaller, from the external popliteal nerve. Perforating the fascia in the lower third, on the anterior aspect, the musculo-cutaneous nerve may be found, the branches of which should be pursued to the toes. On the dorsum of the foot is a venous arch, which ends laterally in the saphenous veins. On the outer side lies the external saphenous nerve ; and about the middle of the instep the internal saphenous nerve ceases. In the interval between the great toe and the next the cutaneous part of the anterior tibial nerve appears. The digital nerves should be traced to the ends of the toes by removing the integuments ; and after the several vessels and nerves are dissected, the fat is to be taken away, in order that the fascia may be seen. The venous arch on the dorsum of the foot has its convexity turned forwards, and receives digital branches from the toes ; at its concavity it is joined by small veins from the instep. Internally and externally it passes into the saphenous veins. The internal saphenous vein begins at the inner side of the great toe, and in the arch. It ascends in front of the inner ankle683 CUTANEOUS NERVES ON THE FRONT. •210.' Source of the cutane- ous nerves. A /i Musculo- cutaneous supplies most of the toes: integument as to the inside of the leg (p. 660). Branches enter it from the inner border and sole of the foot. The external saphenous vein begins on the outside of the little external toe and foot, as well as in the venous arch; and it is continued ' below the outer ankle to the back of the leg (p. 660) Cutaneous Nerves (fig. 210). The super- ficial nerves on the front of the leg and foot are derived mainly from branches of the po- I pliteal trunks, viz., from the musculo-cutaneous 1 and anterior tibial nerves of the external popli- teal, and from the external saphenous nerve of the two popliteal. Some inconsiderable offsets ramify on the front of the leg from the internal saphenous and external popliteal. The musculo-cutaneous nerve (3) ends on the dorsum of the foot and toes. Perforating the fascia in the lower third of the leg with a cutaneous artery, it divides into two principal branches (inner and outer), which give dorsal digital nerves to the sides of all the toes, except the outer part of the little toe and the contigu- ous sides of the great toe and the next. The branches may be traced in the far as the end of the last phalanx : The inner branch (3) sends one offset to the inner side of the foot and great toe, and another to the adjacent sides of the second and third toes : it communicates with the internal saphe- nous and the anterior tibial nerves. The outer branch (4) also divides into two nerves; these lie over the third and fourth interosseous spaces, and bifurcate at the web of the foot for the contiguous sides of the three toes corresponding with those spaces : it joins the external saphenous nerve on the outer border of the foot. The anterior tibial nerve (x) becomes cutaneous in the first interosseous space, and is distributed to the opposed sides of the great toe and the next. The musculo- cutaneous nerve joins it, and sometimes assists in supplying the same toes. The EXTERNAL SAPHENOUS NERVE (fig. 203,'5) comes from the External back of the leg below the outer ankle, and is continued along the saPUenous foot to the outside of the little toe ; aU the outer margin of the°foot receives nerves from it, and the offsets towards the sole are larger than those to the dorsum. Occasionally it supplies both sides°of the little toe and part of the next. * Cutaneous nerves of the front of the leg and foot. 1. Anterior tibial 2.

Internal saphenous nerve (fig. 210,5). This nerve is continued along the vein of the same name to the middle of the instep, where it ceases mostly in the integuments, but some branches pass through the deep fascia to end in the tarsus. The deep fascia of the front of the leg is thickest near the knee- joint, where it gives origin to muscles. On the inner side it is fixed to the anterior border of the tibia ; but externally it is con- tinued round to the back of the leg. A strong intermuscular septum is sent in from the deep surface to the anterior border of the fibula, separating the anterior and external muscles ; and another weaker process passes backwards in the upper third of the leg between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum. Above, the fascia is connected to the heads of the leg-bones ; but below, it is continued to the dorsum of the foot. Above and below the ankle-joint it is strengthened by some transverse fibres, and gives rise to the two parts of the anterior annular ligament; and below the end of the fibula it forms another band, the external annular ligament. Dissection. The fascia is to be removed from the front of the leg and the dorsum of the foot, but the thickened band of the annular ligament above and below the end of the tibia is to be left. In separating the fascia from the subjacent muscles, let the edge of the scalpel be directed upwards. In like manner the fascia may be taken from the peronei muscles on the outer side of the fibula, but without destroying the band (ex- ternal annular ligament) below that bone. On the dorsum of the foot, the dorsal vessels with their nerve are to be displayed, and the tendons of the short and long extensors of the toes are to be traced to the ends of the digits. In the leg, the anterior tibial nerve and vessels are to be followed from the dorsum into their intermuscular space, and are then to be cleaned as high as the knee. The anterior annular ligament consists of two pieces, upper and lower, which confine the muscles in their position,—the former serving to bind the fleshy bellies to the bones of the leg, and the latter to keep down the tendons on the dorsum of the foot. The upper part, above the level of the ankle-joint, is attached laterally to the bones of the leg; it possesses one sheath with synovial membrane for the tibialis anticus. The lower part is situate in front of the tarsal bones. It is in- serted externally by a narrow piece into the upper surface of the os calcis, in front of the interosseous ligament ; and internally, where it is thin and widened, into the plantar fascia and the inner malle- olus. In this piece of the ligament there are three sheaths;—an inner one for the tibialis anticus ; an outer for the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius; and an intermediate one for the ex- tensor hallucis. Separate synovial membranes line the sheaths. The external annular ligament is placed below the fibula, and is attached on the one side to the outer malleolus, and on the other to the os calcis. Its lower edge is connected by fibrous tissue685 MUSCLES ON THE FRONT. to the sheaths of the peronei muscles on the outer side of the os ealcis. It contains the two lateral peronei muscles in one compart- ment ; and this is lined hy a synovial membrane, which sends two offsets below into the separate sheaths of the tendons. The Muscles on the Front of the Leg (fig. 211) are four in ^"^es^ number. The large muscle next the tibia is the tibialis anticus ; the leg that next the fibula, the extensor longus digitorum; while a small muscle, apparently the lower end of the last with a separate tendon to the fifth metatarsal bone, is the peroneus tertius. The muscle between the tibialis and extensor digitorum, in the lower part of the leg, is the extensor propriits hallucis. On the dorsum of the foot only one other muscle appears, the and foot, extensor brevis digitorum. The tibialis anticus (fig. 211,1) reaches the tarsus : it is thick Tibialis and fleshy in the upper, but tendinous in the lower part of the leg. anticus: It arises from the outer tuberosity, and the upper half of the external origin; surface of the tibia ; from the contiguous part of the interosseous membrane; and from the fascia of the leg, and the intermuscular septum between it and the extensor longus digitorum. Its tendon begins below the middle of the leg, and passes beneath both pieces of the annular ligament, where it is surrounded by a synovial sheath, tn be inserted into the internal cuneiform bone, and the metatarsal insertion; bone of the great toe. The muscle is subaponeurotic. It lies at first outside the tibia, rest- parts in ing on the interosseous membrane ; but it is then placed successively ' ' oveT the end of the tibia, the ankle-joint, and the. inner tarsal bones. On its outer side are the extensor muscles of the toes, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Action. Supposing the foot not fixed, the tibialis bends the ankle, use on the and raises the inner border of the foot. loot' free' If the foot is fixed, it can lift the inner border with the tibialis and fixed; posticus, and support the foot on the outer edge.

The EXTENSOR PROPRIUS HALLUCIS (ext. prop, pollicis pedis ; Extensor tig. 211) is deeply placed at its origin between the former muscle lmifucis; and the extensor longus digitorum, but its tendon becomes superficial on the dorsum of the foot. The muscle arises from the middle two- origin from fourths of the narrow anterior surface of the fibula, and from the Uhu]a' interosseous membrane for the same distance. At the ankle it ends in a tendon, which comes to the surface through a sheath in the insertion to lower piece of the annular ligament, and continues over thegreattoe; tarsus to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe.

Peroneus tertius: origin; insertion ; use with tibialis, with peronei. Anterior tibial artery: course and extent; direction ; When the foot is fixed on the ground and the tihia slants back- wards, the muscle can draw forwards that hone. The extensor longus digitorum (fig. 211,s) is fleshy in the leg, and tendinous on the foot, like the other muscles. Its origin is from the head, and upper three-fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula ; from the external tuberosity of the tibia, and about an inch (above) of the interosseous membrane ; and from the fascia of the leg, and the intermusctdar septum on each side. The tendon enters its sheath in the annular ligament with the peroneus tertius, and divides into four pieces. Below the ligament these slips are continued to the four outer toes, and are inserted into the middle and ungual phalanges:— On the metatarsal phalanx the tendons of the long and short extensor join with prolongations from the interossei and lumbricales to form an aponeurosis ; but there is no tendon from the short ex- tensor to the expansion on the little toe. At the distal end of this phalanx the aponeurosis is divided into three parts—a central and two lateral; the central piece is inserted into the base of the middle phalanx, while the lateral unite at the front of the middle, and are fixed into the ungual phalanx. In the leg the muscle is placed between the peronei on the one side, and the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius hallucis on the other. It lies on the fibula, the lower end of the tibia, and the ankle-joint. In the foot the tendons rest on the extensor brevis digitorum ; and the vessels and nerve are internal to them. Action. The muscle extends the four outer toes, acting mainly on the metatarso-phalangeal joints ; it can also bend the ankle-joint. If the tibia is inclined back, as when the foot reaches the ground in walking, it will be moved forwards by this and the other muscles on the front of the leg. The peroneus tertius is situate below the extensor longus digi- torum, from which it is seldom separate. It arises from the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the fibula, from the lower end of the interosseous membrane, and from the intermuscular septum between it and the peroneus brevis muscle ; and it is inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe on the upper surface. This muscle has the same relations in the leg as the lower part of the long extensor, and is contained in the same space in the annular ligament. Action. The muscle assists the tibialis anticus in bending the ankle ; but it differs from that muscle in raising the outer border of the foot, and thus helps the other peronei in producing the move- ment of eversion. The anterior tibial artery (fig. 211,4) extends from the bifur- cation of the popliteal trunk to the front of the ankle-joint. At this spot it becomes the dorsal artery of the foot. The course of the artery is forwards through the aperture in the upper part of the interosseous membrane, along the front of that membrane, and over the tibia to the foot.

The dorsal artery of the foot is the continuation of the an- terior tibial, and extends from the front of the ankle-joint to the posterior part of the first interosseous space : at this interval it passes downwards between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, to end in the sole (p. 680). The artery rests on the inner part of the tarsus, viz., the astraga- lus, the navicular, and middle cuneiform bones ; and it is covered by the integuments and the deep fascia, and by the inner piece of the extensor brevis muscle. The tendon of the extensor hallucis lies on the inner side, and that of the extensor longus digitorum on the outer, but neither is close to the vessel. The veins have the same position with respect to the artery as in the leg ; and the nerve is external to it. Peculiarities. On the dorsum of the foot the artery is often removed farther outwards than the line from the centre of the ankle to the back of the first interosseous space. The dorsal artery may also be reinforced or replaced by a large anterior peroneal branch. Branches:— Branches. Small offsets are given to the integuments, and the bones and ligaments of the inner side of the foot ; from the outer side of the vessel proceed two larger branches named tarsal and metatarsal ; and an interosseous branch is furnished to the first metatarsal space. Tarsal. a. The tarsal branch arises opposite the head of the astragalus, and runs beneath the extensor brevis digitorum to the outer border, of the foot, where it divides into twigs that inosculate with the meta- tarsal, external plantar, and anterior peroneal arteries: it supplies offsets to the extensor muscle beneath which it lies. external.

From the arch of the metatarsal branch three dorsal interosseous ^°gfveR arteries are furnished to the three outer metatarsal spaces ; and the seous, external of these sends a branch to the outer side of the little toe. They supply the interosseous muscles, and divide at the cleft of the toes into two small dorsal digital branches. At the fore part of the metatarsal space each interosseous branch and per- joins a digital artery in the sole of the foot by means of the anterior foratinS- perforating twig; and from the beginning of each a small branch, posterior perforating, descends to the plantar arch. c. The first dorsal interosseous artery arises from the main trunk First inter- J *j osseous as this is about to leave the dorsum of the foot; it extends forwards in the space between the first two toes, and is distributed by dorsal digital pieces like the other dorsal interosseous offsets. The anterior tibial veins have the same extent and relations ^j^""^ as the vessel they accompany. They take their usual position along the artery, one on each side, and form loops around it by cross branches ; they end in the popliteal vein. The branches they receive correspond with those of the artery ; and they communicate with the internal saphenous vein. Dissection. To examine the extensor brevis digitorum on the Divide dorsum of the foot, cut through the tendons of the extensor longus iongus. and peroneus tertius below the annular ligament, and throw them towards the toes.

Between the fibula and the peroneus longus muscle the external popliteal nerve divides into the musculo-cutaneous and anterior tibial; and from the beginning of the anterior tibial nerve, or the end of the popliteal trunk, a small branch called the recurrent articular is given off. The recurrent articular branch takes the course of the artery of the same name through the tibialis anticus muscle, in wbich most of its fibres end. A small twig may be followed to the knee- joint. The musculo-cutaneous nerve is continued between the extensor longus digitorum and the peronei muscles to the lower third of the leg, where it pierces the fascia, and is distributed to the dorsum of the foot and the toes (p. 683). Before the nerve becomes cutaneous it furnishes branches to the two larger peronei muscles. The anterior tibial nerve (fig. 211) is directed beneath the extensor longus digitorum, and reaches the tibial artery in the lower part of the upper third of the leg. From this spot it takes the course of the vessel along the leg and foot to the first interosseous space (p. 683). In the leg it lies for the most part in front of the anterior tibial vessels, but on the foot it is generally external to the dorsal artery. Branches. In the leg the nerve supplies the anterior tibial muscle, the extensors of the toes, and the peroneus tertius. On the dorsum of the foot it furnishes a considerable branch to the short extensor : this becomes enlarged, and gives offsets to the articulations of the foot. Muscles on the Outer Side op the Leg (fig. 205). Two muscles occupy this situation, and are named peroneal from their attachment to the fibula : they are distinguished as long and short. Intermuscular processes of fascia, which are attached to the fibula, isolate these muscles from others. The peroneus longus (fig. 205, g), the more superficial of the two muscles, passes into the sole of the foot round the outer border. It arises from the outer tuberosity of the tibia by a small slip ; from the head, and the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula for two- thirds of the length, gradually tapering downwards ; and from the fascia and the intermuscular septa. Inferiorly, it ends in a tendon which is continued through the external annular ligament with the peroneus brevis, lying in the groove at the back of the external malleolus ; and it passes finally in a separate sheath below the peroneus brevis along the side of the os calcis, and through the groove in the outer border of the cuboid bone, to the sole of the foot. Its position in the foot, and its insertion are described before (p. 682). In the leg the muscle is immediately beneath the fascia, and lies on the peroneus brevis. Beneath the annular ligament it is placed over the middle piece of the external lateral ligament of the ankle691 PEK0NE1 MUSCLES. with the peroneus brevis, and is surrounded by a single synovial membrane common to both.

The knee is the largest joint in the body, and is iormed by the contiguous ends of the tibia and femur, with the patella. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, and are maintained in apposition by strong and numerous ligaments. Oapsui The capsule (fig. 212) is an aponeurotic covering on the front of the joint, which closes the wide intervals between the anterior and how formed, the lateral ligaments ; and it is derived from the fascia lata united with fibrous offsets of the extensor and flexor muscles. It covers the anterior and the external lateral ligaments, being inserted below into arrange- the heads of the tibia and fibula ; and it blends on the inner side ment.

It is separated from the synovial membrane by the anterior ligament and by fat. Dissection. Four external ligaments, anterior and posterior, inter- nal and external lateral, are situate at opposite parts of the articula- tion. The posterior and the internal lateral ligaments will appear on the removal of the areolar tissue from their surfaces ; but the anterior and the external lateral are covered by the aponeurosis on the front of the joint, and will not be laid bare till this has been cut through. If there is a second external lateral band present, it is not concealed by the aponeurosis. The external lateral ligament (fig. 212,s) is round and cord-like. It is attached to the tuberosity of the outer condyle of the femur, below the tendon of the gastrocnemius, and descends vertically between two pieces of the tendon of the biceps to a depression on the * External aspect of the knee-joint (Bourgery). 1.

Beneath the liga- ment are the tendon of the popliteus, and the external lower articular vessels and nerve. A second fasciculus is sometimes present behind the other, but °^ional it is not attached to the femur ; it is connected above with the gastrocnemius, and below with the styloid process of the head of the fibula. The tendon of the biceps is inserted by two pieces into the head of ^ndon of^ the fibula; and from both of these, fibres are prolonged to the head divided. of the tibia. The external lateral ligament passes between the pieces into which the tendon is split. The tendon of the popliteus may be followed by dividing the Tendon of posterior ligament. It arises from the fore part of the oblong teuS^0ph* depression on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur. In its course to the outside of the joint, it crosses the external semilunar fibro-cartilage and the upper tibio-peroneal articulation. When the joint is bent, the tendon lies in the hollow on the condyle; but it slips out of that groove when the limb is extended. The tendon of the adductor magnus is inserted into the adductor ^u°cftor tubercle on the internal condyle of the femur, above the attachment magnus. of the internal lateral ligament. The internal lateral ligament (fig. 213, 3) is attached above to the Internal condyle of the femur, where it blends with the capsule ; but becoming llga" thicker below, and separate from the rest of the capsule, it is fixed attach- for about an inch into the inner surface of the tibia, below the level me"ts; of the ligamentum patella?: some of the deeper fibres join the internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. The tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles is joined by lie over the ligament ; and the tendon of the semimembranosus, {^nosus. and the internal lower articular vessels and nerve are beneath it. To the posterior edge some fibres from the tendon of the semimem- branosus are added. The tendon of the semimembranosus muscle is inserted beneath the Insertion internal lateral ligament into the lower part of the groove at the nfembrano-' back of the inner tuberosity of the tibia : between it and the upper sua- edge of the groove is a synovial bursa. The tendon sends a few fibres to the internal lateral ligament, a prolongation to join the fascia on the popliteus muscle, and another to the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The posterior ligament is wide and membranous, and is formed Posterior in great part by a strong slip from the tendon of the semimem- ,lgament branosus, which is directed across the joint to the outer side. It is fixed below to the head of the tibia behind the articular surface; and above, it is attached to the femur at the upper border of the intercondylar notch in the centre, but on each side it joins the tendinous head of the gastrocnemius. Numerous apertures exist in it for the passage of the vessels and nerves to the interior of the articulation ; and the tendon of the popliteus pierces its outer part.694 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Anterior ligament is tendon of the extensor. Open the knee-joint in front The anterior ligament or ligamentum patella; (fig. 213,2) is part of the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscle of the knee (p. 620). About two inches long, it is attached above to the apex and lower border of the patella ; and below to the tubercle of the tibia. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers it ; and a bursa intervenes between it and the front of the tibia above the tubercle. Dissection (fig. 214). To see the reflections of the synovial mem- brane, raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an incision on each side, above the patella. When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) and behind. Synovial membrane will be seen extending from the intercondylar fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is another fold (alar ligament) over some fat. The limb may be laid fiat on the table, and some of the posterior ligament removed, to show the pouches of the synovial membrane which project behind over the condyles of the femur ; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the parts are learnt. The synovial membrane (fig. 214) lines the interior of the joint, and is continued to the margins of the articular surfaces of the bones. It invests the interarticular fibro-cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and sends a pouch between the tendon of the popliteus and the external fibro-cartilage and the head of the tibia ; it is also reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. * The capsule of tho knee-joint cut across, and the patella thrown down, to show the named folds of the synovial sac. a. Mucous ligament, b. Internal, and c. External alar ligament.695 SYNOVIAL SAC AND FAT AROUND KNEE. There are three named folds of the synovial membrane. One in the centre of the joint is the mucous ligament (a), which contains ligaments,— small vessels and some fat, and extends from the interval between mucous, the condyles to the fat below the patella. Below and on each side of the patella is another fold—alar ligament (b and c), which is con- and alar, tinuous with the former below the patella, and is placed over a mass of fat: the inner (b) is prolonged farther than the outer by a semi- lunar piece of the synovial membrane. At the back and front of the articulation pouches are prolonged Pouches: beneath the tendons of muscles. Behind there are two, one on each side, between the condyle of the femur and the tendinous bead of two behind, the gastrocnemius. On the front, the sac projects under the extensor muscle one inch above the articular surface ; and if it communicates and one with the bursa in that situation, it will reach two inches above the before- joint-surface of the femur. When the joint is bent there is a greater length of the serous sac above the patella. Fat around the joint. Two large masses are placed above and below Articular the patella, and a smaller quantity of fat surrounds the crucial liga-fat' ments. The infrapatellar mass, the largest of all, fills the interval between below the the patella with its ligament and the head of the tibia, and gives patella ■ origin to the ridges of the synovial membrane. From it a piece is continued round the patella ; but it is larger at the inner margin than at the outer, and overhangs the inner perpendicular facet of that bone. This infrapatellar pad adapts itself to the varying shape and extent of the angular interspace between the bones and the liga- U3e; men turn patellse in the movements of the joint. The suprapatellar pad is interposed between the common extensor above the tendon and the femur round the top of the synovial sac, and is larger patella" on the outer than the inner side.

The ligamentous structures within the cap- Dissect sule will be brought into view, while the limb is still in the same ligaments, position, by throwing down the patella and its ligament, and clear- ing away the fat behind it. In this step the student must be careful of a small transverse band which connects anteriorly the interarticu- lar fibro-cartilages. The remains of the capsule and other ligaments, and the synovial membrane, are next to be cleared away from the front and back of the crucial ligaments, and from the fibro-cartilages. While cleaning the posterior crucial ligament, the limb is to be placed flat on the table with the patella down ; and the student is to be careful of a band in front of it from the external fibro-cartilage, or of two bands, one before and the other behind it. Ligaments within the capsule. The ligamentous structures within Ligaments the capsule consist of the central crucial ligaments, and of two plates ^apg|Se'Ue of fibro-cartilage on the head of the tibia. The crucial ligaments (fig. 215) are two strong fibrous cords Two crucial between the ends of the tibia and femur, which maintain the ligamonts- bones in contact. They cross one another like the legs of the letter X, and have received their name from that circumstance.DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 696 Anterior is oblique; its attach- ments. Posterior is vertical; its attach- ments. Their use. Both unite the bones. Rotation in checked by anterior. Special use of anterior, and poste- rior crucial. One is much anterior to the other at the attachment of the tibia. The anterior ligament (/) is very oblique in its direction, and is longer than the posterior. Inferiorly it is attached in front of the spine of the tibia, close to the inner articular surface, reaching back to the inner point of the spine ; superiorly it is inserted into an impression on the hinder part of Fig. 215.* the inner surface of the external condyle of the femur. The posterior ligament (e), the thicker of the two, is almost vertical between the bones at the back of the joint. By the lower end it is fixed to the hindmost impression of the hollow behind the spine of the tibia, near the margin of the bone ; and above, it is inserted into a mark occupying the lower part of the outer surface of the internal condyle, and extending forwards to the centre of the intercondylar fossa. The use of these ligaments in the movements of the joint may now be studied after the external ligaments have been cut through. As long as both ligaments are whole the bones cannot be separated from each other. Rotation in of the tibia is stopped by the anterior crucial. Rota- tion out is not checked by either ligament; for the bands uncross in the execution of the movement, and will permit the tibia to be tlimed hind part foremost. Supposing the tibia to move as in straightening the limb, the anterior prevents that bone being carried too far forwards by the extensor muscle, or by external force ; and the ligament is brought into action at the end of extension, because the tibia is being put in front of the femur. Its use is shown by cutting it across, and leav- ing the posterior entire, as then the tibial articulating surfaces can be placed in front of the femoral in the half-bent state of the joint. The posterior crucial arrests the too great movement backwards of the tibia by the flexors or by force ; and it is stretched in extreme flexion, in which the tibia is being drawn back from the femur. This use will be exemplified by cutting across the posterior (in * Interarticular ligaments of the knee-joint, a.

The two interarticular or semilunar fibro-cartilages (fig. 216) partly cover on each side the articular surface of the tibia. They are thick at the convex margin, where they are united by fibres to the capsule, and are thin, sharp, and free at the concave edge ; they are hollowed on the upper surface, so as to assist in giving depth to the fossae for the reception of the condyles of the femur, but are flattened below. Inserted into the tibia at their ex- tremities, they are coarsely fibrous at their attachment to Fig. 216.* the bone, like the crucial liga- ments ; and they become car- tilaginous only where they lie between the articular surfaces. The synovial membrane is re- flected over them. The internal fibro-cartilage (a) is ovoid in form, and is less sharply curved than the external. In front it is attached by a pointed end close to the anterior margin of the head of the tibia, in front of the anterior crucial ligament. At the back, where it is much wider, it is fixed to the inner lip of the hollow behind the spine of the tibia, between the attachment of the other cartilage and the posterior crucial ligament. The external fibro-cartilage (b) is nearly circular in form, and is connected to the bone within the points of attachment of its fellow. Its anterior part is fixed in front of the spine of the tibia, close to the outer articular surface, and opposite the anterior crucial ligament which it touches ; and its posterior extremity is inserted behind and between the two osseous points of the spine. This fibro-cartilage is less closely united to the capsule than the internal, for the fore part is in the centre of the joint, and the tendon of the popliteus muscle separates it behind from that membrane. The outer fibro-cartilage is provided with two accessory bands, one in front, the other behind. The anterior or transverse ligament (c) is a narrow band of fibres between the semilunar cartilages at the front of the joint. Some- times it is very small or even absent. The posterior or ascending band (d), thicker and stronger than the other, springs from the back of the outer fibro-cartilage, .and is inserted into the femur, as a single band (fig. 216, d), when it is Semilunar cartilages are two.

The fibro-cartilages deepen the sockets of the tibia for the reception of the condyles of the femur, and fill the interval between the articular surfaces of the bones at the circumference of the joint; they distribute the pressure of one bone on the other over a larger surface, and cause the force of shocks to be diminished in transmission. In flexion and extension they move forwards and backwards with the tibia. During flexion they recede somewhat from the fore part of the joint, and surround the narrow parts of the condyles of the femur; but in extension they are flattened out on the surface of the tibia. Of the two cartilages, the external moves the most in con- sequence of its being less attached to the capsule. In rotation the fibro-cartilages follow the tibial movements, but the external is most displaced by the projecting outer condyle of the femur. The accessory bands in front and behind serve to retain in place the less fixed external fibro-cartilage; thus the anterior ligament keeps forwards the front of that cartilage in flexion, and the posterior secures the back of the same from displacement in rotation. Articular surfaces of the bones. The end of the femur is marked by a patellar and two tibial surfaces. The patellar is placed in the middle above the others; it is hollowed along the centre, with a slanting surface on each side, the outer being much the larger of the two. The surfaces for contact with the tibia, two in number, occupy the ends of the condyles, and are separated from the patellar im- pression by an oblique groove on each side. At the lower part of each is a somewhat flattened surface, which is in contact with the tibia in standing; while behind there is a more convex portion, which touches the tibia in flexion. The inner condyle of the femur is curved at its anterior third, the concavity being directed out: this has been named the "oblique curvature." At the outer margin of the curve is a semilunar facet, which touches the perpendicular surface of the patella in extreme flexion. On the head of the tibia are two slight articular hollows, the inner being the deeper and larger, which rise towards the middle of the bone, on the points of the tibial spine. The joint-surface of the patella is marked by the following im- pressions. Close to the inner edge is a narrow perpendicular facet, and along the lower border is a similar transverse mark. Occupying the rest of the bone is a squarish surface, which is subdivided by a vertical and a transverse line into two pairs of marks—upper and lower. (Goodsir.) Movements of the joint. The chief movements of the knee are two in number, bending and straightening, like the elbow ; but there is, in addition, rotation of the tibia when the joint is bent. Flexion and extension. Each of these movements may be divided into stages for the purpose of indicating changes in its direction.699 MOVEMENTS OF THE KNEE. In flexion, the tibia with its fibro-cartilages moves backwards round Flexion: the end of the femur ; and the motion is limited by the extensor movement muscle, and by the meeting of the calf of the leg with the thigh. oiUbm; For the anterior third of the movement the tibia is directed back- ^"Sf^ wards and inwards along the oblique curve of the inner condyle, giving rise to an inward rotation of that bone ; but for the posterior two-thirds, the tibia passes straight back and up over both condyles. All the external ligaments are relaxed, except the anterior ; and state of the same is the case with the anterior crucial: the posterior crucial hsaments- ligament is put forcibly on the stretch towards the end of flexion.

Peroneotibial Articulations. The tibia and fibula are united by ligamentous bands at the extremities where they touch, and by an interosseous membrane between the shafts of the bones. Dissection. The muscles are to be taken away from the front and back of the interosseous membrane ; and the loose tissue is to be removed from a small band in front of, and behind, the upper and lower ends of the tibia and fibula. The upper articulation has very slight movement, and the structures between the ends of the bones are two small bands, anterior and posterior. The anterior ligament extends over the joint from the outer tube- rosity of the tibia to the head of the fibula. The posterior ligament, thinner than the anterior, is attached to the bones behind the joint: it is covered by the tendon of the popliteus muscle and a prolon- gation of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. The articular surfaces are covered with cartilage ; and the synovial cavity of the articulation is only separated by the thin posterior liga- ment from that of the knee-joint. The lower articulation possesses anterior, posterior, and inferior bands, together with an interosseous ligament (inferior) between the ends of the bones. The anterior ligament reaches obliquely from the lower end of the tibia to the fibula ; and the posterior has attachments behind the articulation similar to those of the band in front. The inferior ligament closes the notch at the back between the contiguous ends of the tibia and fibula, and consists of transverse yellowish fibres distinct from the posterior ligament. It is fixed on one side to the end of the fibula above the pit; and on the other it is inserted into the contiguous part of the tibia, and into the posterior edge of the articular surface, so as to assist in deepening the hollow into which the astragalus is received. This band cannot be seen until the astragalus has been disarticulated after the examination of the ankle-joint. The inferior interosseous ligament consists of strong bundles of fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards between the adjacent rough surfaces at the lower ends of the two bones. This also may be seen after the dissection of the ankle-joint, by sawing longitudinally the ends of the leg-bones. The interosseous membrane fills the interval between the bones of the leg, and serves as an aponeurotic partition between the muscles on the front and back of the limb. Its fibres are directed for the most part downwards from the tibia to the fibula ; but a few cross in the opposite direction. Internally it is fixed to the outer edge of the tibia ; and externallyj to the prominent interosseous ridge on the inner side of the fibula. In its upper part, close to the neck of the fibula, is an oval opening about an inch in length, which transmits the anterior tibial vessels ;701 LIGAMENTS OF ANKLE-JOINT. and at the lower end, between the membrane and the inferior articulation, is another small opening for the anterior peroneal vessels. Movement. Very little movement is allowed in the tibio-peroneal Motion articulations, as the chief use of the fibula is to give strength and elasticity to the ankle-joint, and attachment to muscles of the leg. In the upper joint there is a slight gliding chiefly from within in upper, out. In the lower articulation the ligaments permit some yielding of the fibula to the pressure of the astragalus, as when the weight avtieula- of the body is thrown on the inner side of the foot; but if the force tion- is violent, that bone will be fractured about the junction of the third and lowest fourths sooner than the ligaments give way.

For the purpose of defining the lateral ligaments, the limb must be placed first on one side and then on the other. The internal liga- ment is wide and strong, and lies beneath the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The external is divided into three separate pieces ; and to show these, the peronei muscles, and the remains of the annular ligament below the outer malleolus, should be taken away. * Internal lateral ligament of the ankle (altered from Bourgery). 1.

The external lateral ligament (fig. 218) consists of three separate pieces, anterior, middle, and posterior, which are attached to the astragalus and the os calcis. The anterior piece (') is a short fiat band, which is directed from the fore part of the malleolus to the side of the astragalus in front of the lateral articular surface. The middle portion (3) is flattened, and descends from the tip of the malleolus to the outer surface of the os calcis, about the middle. The posterior (2) is the strongest, and is almost horizontal in direc- tion ; it is connected externally to the pit on the inner surface of the malleolus, and is inserted into the posterior part of the astra- galus behind the upper articular surface, extending to the groove for the flexor hallucis tendon. The posterior and middle fasciculi are placed beneath the peronei muscles. The middle piece is but slightly in contact above with the synovial membrane of the ankle-joint; and both it and the posterior piece touch the synovial membrane between the astragalus and the os calcis. Dissection. Dividing the ligaments of the ankle-joint, separate the astragalus from the bones of the leg, to see the osseous surfaces entering into the joint. The synovial membrane of the joint lines the capsule, and is simple in its arrangement; but the cavity is continued upwards for a short distance between the tibia and fibula. Articular surfaces. On the tibia there are two articular surfaces, one of which corresponds with the end of the shaft, and the other with the malleolus. On the fibula the surface of the malleolus which is turned to the astragalus is covered with cartilage. The astragalus has a central articular surface, wider before (ban behind and trochlea-sbaped, which touches the end of the tibia ; and on its sides are articular impressions for contact with the malleoli, but the outer one is the larger.MOVEMENTS IN ANKLE-JOINT. 703 Movements.

The interosseous ligament (fig. 219, c) consists of strong vertical and oblique fibres, which are attached above and below to the depressions on the contiguous surfaces of the two bones. This band extends across the bones, and its depth is greatest at the outer side. In a subsequent stage of the dissection (p. 707) the articular surfaces of the bones will be seen, viz., one behind the interosseous ligament, and one in front of it, with two sxjnovial cavities. Movements. It is between the astragalus and os calcis that the important movements of the foot known as inversion and eversion chiefly take place. The motion is one of rotation about an oblique axis, which is directed from the upper and inner part of the head of the astragalus, backwards, downwards, and outwards to the lower and outer part of the posterior extremity of the os calcis.

As a result of this, aided by corresponding movements of the anterior tarsal bones, the fore part of the foot is depressed, and the arch increased; the toes are moved inwards ; and the outer border of the foot sinks, turning the sole in.

Astragalus with the navicular bone. The head of the Astragalus astragalus is received into the hollow of the navicular bone, and is naviCUiar united to it by a dorsal ligament; but the place of plantar and tone: external lateral ligaments is supplied by strong bands between the os calcis and the navicular bone, which will be noticed below.

Supposing the tendon of the tibialis posticus removed, the inferior ligament will be defined in the sole of the foot by cutting some fibro-cartilaginous substance from it. The inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament (fig. 221, c) is attached inferior behind to the fore part of the sustentaculum tali of the os calcis, and in front, to the hollow on the under surface of the navicular bone. In the upright posture of the body the tendon of the tibialis posticus is beneath it in the sole of the foot ; and on it the head of the astragalus rests. The erternal calcaneonavicular ligament (fig. 219, e) is placed external outside the head of the astragalus, and serves as a lateral ligament lament, to the astragalo-navicular articulation : it is about three-quarters of an inch deep. Behind, it is fixed to the upper part of the os calcis, between the articular surfaces for the cuboid bone and astragalus ; and in front it is inserted into the outer side of the navicular bone. The synovial cavity of this articulation is continued backwards synovial into the joint between the front of the os calcis and the astragalus. sac- Articular surfaces. The head of the astragalus has two articular Surfaces of faces ; a smaller, below, for the os calcis ; and a larger one, elon- bone- gated transversely and broader externally than internally, for the navicular bone.

The articulation are plantar, dorsal, and internal. The dorsal or superior calcaneo-cuboid ligament (fig. 219, r/) is a rather thin fasciculus of fibres, which is attached near to the con- tiguous ends of the os calcis and the cuboid bone; it is sometimes divided into two pieces, or it may be situate at the outer border of the foot. At the inner side of the cuboid bone is a stronger internal band (fig. 219,/) from the os calcis; this is fixed behind to the upper Fig. 220.* and inferior ligaments. The last is strongest, and divided into two parts : superficial and part of the os calcis, external to the band to the navicular bone, and in front to the contiguous inner side of the cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligament is much the strongest, and is divided into a superficial and a deep part:— The superficial portion, long plantar ligament (fig. 220, is attached to the under surface of the os calcis from near the posterior to the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone ; but the most internal are continued over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, assisting to form its sheath, and are inserted into the bast s of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. * Plantar ligaments of the foot (Bourgery). 1.

These joints participate, as has been already seen, in the move- movements; ments of inversion and eversion, the anterior bones moving over the hinder ones, downwards and inwards in inversion, and upwards araputation and outwards in eversion. It is at this line that the foot is practised divided in the operation known as Chopart's amputation. here- Dissection.

Then the interosseous ligament uniting the astragalus and the os calcis is to be cut through, to demonstrate its attachments, the articular surfaces of the bones, and the synovial sacs (p. 704). Articular surfaces of the two hinder tarsal bones. There are two Surfaces of articular surfaces, anterior' and posterior, to both the astragalus and os calcis the os calcis. The hinder one of the os calcis is convex from before back, and the anterior is concave; but sometimes the latter is subdivided into two. The surface of the astragalus will have a andastra- form exactly the reverse of that of the os calcis, viz., the hinder one galus' concave and the anterior convex; the anterior is seated on the head of the astragalus. Dissection. The calcaneocuboid joint may be opened to see the articular surfaces ; and the student is to keep in mind that all the other articulations of the foot are to be opened for the like purpose, even should directions not be given. Articulations of the navicular bone. The navicidar bone Union of the articulates in front with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally 'bam'™lar with the cuboid. In the articulation with the cuneiform bones (fig. 219) there are to the cunci- three longitudinal dorsal ligaments (i, k, I), one to each bone ; butfom; z z 2DISSECTION OF THE LEG. the innermost is the strongest and widest, and extends round the inside of the articulation into the sole of the foot (fig. 221, e). The place of plantar bands is supplied by processes of the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The naviculo-cuneiform articulations form one continuous joint, and from their synovial cavity offsets are sent forwards between the cuneiform bones. In the articulation with the cuboid there is a dorsal oblique band of fibres (fig. 219, h) between the contiguous parts of the bones ; a plantar transverse band (fig. 221, d), which is concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus ; and a strong interosseous ligament. When the bones touch, the surfaces are tipped with cartilage, and a process of the naviculo-cuneiform synovial cavity extends between them. Articulations of the cuneiform bones. These bones are united to one another by cross bands; and the external one articulates with the cuboid after a similar manner. The three cuneiform bones are connected together by short trans- verse dorsal bands (fig. 219, n) between the upper surfaces. Similar plantar ligaments are wanting, except one between the two inner- most (fig. 221, /). There are also interosseous ligaments between the contiguous surfaces of the bones. Laterally there are articular surfaces between the bones, with offsets of the common synovial cavity. Where the external cuneiform touches the cuboid bone, the sur- faces are covered with cartilage. A dorsal ligament (fig. 219, n) passes transversely between the two ; and a plantar ligament (fig. 221, g) takes a similar direction. Between the bones there is also an interosseous ligament. This joint is furnished either with a distinct synovial sac, or with a prolongation of the common synovial cavity. The synovial cavity of the articulations of the cuneiform bones is com- mon to many of the bones of the tarsus. Placed between the navicular and the three cuneiforms, it sends one prolongation forwards between the inner and middle cuneiform to the joints with the second and third metatarsal bones ; another between the middle and outer cuneiform bones; a third outwards to the articulation of the navicular with the cuboid bone (when present) ; and sometimes a fourth to the joint between the external cuneiform and the cuboid. Articular surfaces. On the navicular are three articular facets, the inner being rounded, and the other two flattened. The three cunei- forms unite in a shallow elliptical hollow, which is most excavated internally. Movement. The cuneiform bones glide up and nut on the navicular in inversion of the foot, and down and in in eversion ; aud the inner one moves more than the others in consequence of the shape of the articular surfaces, and the attachment to it of the tibialis aniieus.. When the bones pass clown the dorsal ligaments are made tight: and as they rise the interosseous and transverse plantar bands will keep them united.70'J LIGAMENTS OF METATARSAL BONES.

Articulation of the metatarsal bones. The bases of the four Union of the meta- outer metatarsal bones are connected together by dorsal, plantar, tarsus by and interosseous ligaments ; and where their lateral parts touch, they are covered with cartilage, and have offsets of a synovial sac. The dorsal ligaments (fig. 222) are small transverse bands from dorsal, the base of one metatarsal bone to the next. The plantar ligaments plantar, (fig. 220) are similar to the dorsal. The interosseous ligaments are short transverse fibres between the con- tiguous rough lateral surfaces : they may be afterwards seen by forcibly separating the bones. Lateral union. The four outer bones touch one another laterally ; the second metatarsal lies against the internal and external cunei- forms ; and the fourth is in contact inter- nally with the outer cuneiform. The articulating surfaces are covered with car- tilage ; and their synovial cavities are offsets of those serving for the articulation of the same four metatarsal with the tarsal bones. The metatarsal bone of the great toe, like that of the thumb, is not united to the others at its hase by any intervening bands. The distal ends of the five metatarsal bones are united by the transverse metatarsal ligament; this has been described on page 680. Tarsal with metatarsal bones. These articulations resemble the like parts in the hand, as there is a metatarsus separate joint for the great toe, and a common one for the four outer metatarsals. Articulation of the great toe.

The joint possesses likewise slight abductory and adductory move- ment. Articulation of the four outer toes. The three outer tarsal bones of the distal row correspond with four metatarsals,—the middle cunei- form being opposite the second metatarsal bone, the external cunei- form touching the third, and the cuboid carrying the outer two bones. The surfaces in contact are tipped with cartilage, and have longitudinal dorsal, plantar, and lateral ligaments, with some oblique in the sole. The dorsal ligaments (fig. 222) are thin bands of fibres, which are more or less longitudinal as they extend from the tarsal to the metatarsal bones. Each metatarsal bone receives one ligament, except that of the second toe, to which there are three,—the three bands to the second coming from all the cuneiform bones, one from each. The third bone obtains a ligament from the external cunei- form ; and the fourth and fifth have a fasciculus to each from the cuboid. Plantar ligaments (fig. 220). There is one longitudinal band from each of the outer two cuneiform to the corresponding metatarsal bone ; but between the cuboid and its metatarsal bones there are only some scattered fibres. The lateral ligaments are longitudinal; they he deeply between the bones, and are connected with the second and third metatarsals : they will be better seen by cutting the transverse bands joining the bases of the bones. To the bone of the second toe there are two bands, one on each side;—the inner is strong and is attached to the internal cuneiform ; and the outer is fixed to the external cunei- form bone. The metatarsal bone of the third toe is provided with one lateral slip on its outer side, which is inserted behind into the external cuneiform bone. Oblique plantar ligaments. A fasciculus of fibres extends across from the front of the internal cuneiform to the second and third meta- tarsals ; and from the external cuneiform there is another slip to the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Line of the articulation. The line of the articulation between the tarsus and metatarsus is zigzag, in consequence of the unequal lengths of the cuneiform bones. To open the articulation, the knife should be carried obliquely forwards from the tuberosity of the fifth to the outer side of the second metatarsal bone ; then about two lines farther back for the union of the second metatarsal with the middle cuneiform ; and finally, half an inch in front of the last articulation, for the joint of the internal cuneiform with the first metatarsal bone. Two synovial cavities are present in these tarso-metatarsal articu- lations. There is one between the cuboid and the two outer metatarsals, which serves also for the adjacent lateral articular surfaces of the latter bones : this is not always separate from the folio whig. The second is placed in the joint between the external and middle cuneiforms with their metatarsal bones (third and second), and is711 METATARSOPHALANGEAL JOINTS. an offset of the common synovial cavity belonging to the articula- tion of the navicular with the cuneiform bones (p. 708) : prolonga- tions from it extend between the lateral articular faces of the second, third, and fourth (inner side) metatarsals.

Articulations of the phalanges. There are two interpha- langeal joints to each toe, except the first. Ligaments similar to those in the metatarso-phalangeal joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior, are to be recognized in these articulations. The joint between the last two phalanges is least distinct; and often- times the small bones are immoveably united by osseous substance. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissection of the hand (p. 327). A simple synovial membrane exists in each phalangeal articulation. Articular surfaces. In both phalangeal joints, the nearer phalanx presents a trochlear surface ; and the distal one is marked by two lateral hollows or cups with a median ridge. Movement. Only flexion and extension are permitted in the two phalangeal joints of the toes, as in the hand. In flexion the farther phalanx glides under the nearer; and in extension the two are brought into a straight line. The bending is checked by the lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon; and the straightening is limited by the inferior ligament and the flexor tendons.ARTERIES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 713 TABLE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE LOWER LIMB.

The eyeball is the organ of vision, and is lodged in the orbit Supported in that hollow on a mass of fat, it is surrounded by muscles which impart movement to it; and a thin membrane (tunica vaginalis oculi or capsule of Tenon) isolates the ball, so as to allow free movement. Two lids protect the eye from external injury, and regulate tin- amount of light admitted into the interior ; and the anterior or ex- posed surface is covered by a mucous membrane (conjunctiva). Directions. In the absence of specimens of the human eye, the structure may be learnt on the eye of the pig or ox. Let the stu- dent procure half a dozen eyes of the ox for the purpose of dissec- tion. One or two shallow basins will be needed ; and some wax or tallow in the bottom of one, or in a deep plate, will be useful. Dissection. To see the general form of the ball of the eye, and the outer surface of the external coat, the attachments of the different muscles are to be taken away ; and the loose mucous membrane is to be removed from the front. The hall of the eye (fig. 223) consists of two parts, which differ in appearance, viz., an opaque posterior portion, forming about five- sixths of the whole, and a smaller transparent piece (cornea) in front; these two parts are segments of different sized spheres, the anterior belonging to the smaller sphere. To the back of the eye the optic nerve is attached, rather to the inner side of the axis of the ball ; and around it ciliary vessels and nerves enter. The antero-posterior diameter of the ball amounts to nearly an inch (igths), but the transverse measures an inch. The organ of vision is composed of central transparent parts, with enclosing membranes or coats. The coats, placed one within another, are named sclerotic, choroid, and retina. The transparent media in the interior are likewise three, viz., the lens, the aqueous humour, and the vitreous body. Dissection. To obtain a general idea of the structures to be dis- sected, the student may destroy one eyeball by cutting through it circularly : he will then be able to recognise the arrangement of • the parts mentioned above, with their strength and appearance, and will be better prepared to follow the directions that are after- wards given.717 SCLEROTIC COAT. Fibrous Coat of the Eyeball. The outer casing of the eye consists of an opaque hinder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior transparent portion, the cornea. The sclerotic is the firm, whitish, opaque portion of the outer coat of the eyeball, which supports the more delicate structures within. Dissection, To examine the inner and outer surfaces of this layer, Fig. 223.* Fibrous coat. Sclerotic part. Dissection to see the interior. it will be necessary to cut circularly with a scissors through the cornea close to the sclerotic, and to remove the cornea from the front of the eyeball; on piercing the cornea the aqueous fluid escapes from the containing chamber. The other structures may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 223, a) extends from the Extent of entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming sulerot,c; about five-sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one-tenth apertures of an inch), the optic nerve (I) is transmitted through an aperture Mund' in it : this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cribriform when the nerve is drawn out,—the lattice-like condition being due to the bundles of fibrous tissue between the funiculi of * Diagram of a horizontal section of the eyeball, a.

It consists of laminar fibrous tissue, with conjunctiva in front, and an elastic membrane behind ; no vessels ; many nerves. the nerve. Small apertures for the passage of vessels and nerves are situate around the optic nerve ; and there are others for vessels at the front and the centre of the ball. Anteriorly the sclerotic is continuous with the transparent cornea. On the outer surface this coat is smooth, except where the muscles are attached ; on the inner aspect it is of a dark colour, with flocculi of fine areolar tissue (membrana fusca) uniting it to the next coat, and Avith the ends of ruptured vessels and nerves. The sclerotic covering is thickest at the back of the eyeball, but it becomes thinner and whiter about a quarter of an inch from the cornea, where it is visible as the " white of the eye." Towards the junction with the cornea it is again somewhat thickened. In its substance, near the union with the cornea, is a small flattened venous space, the carnal of Schlemm (sinus circularis iridis; fig. 223, r). Structure. The sclerotic consists of bundles of white fibrous tissue, which interlace with one another, but run for the most part longi- tudinally and transversely. Its vessels are very scanty. Minute filaments of the ciliary nerves have been described, entering the deep surface of the membrane. Cornea (fig. 223, d). This firm transparent membrane forms about one-sixth of the eyeball, and measures about half an inch across. Its shape is circular, though when viewed from the front it appears larger in the transverse direction, in consequence of the opaque sclerotic structure encroaching farther on it above and below than ou the sides. It is convex in front, and concave behind ; and its thickness is nearly uniform (from -^th. to -g^th. of an inch), except near the cir- cumference, where it is somewhat thicker at the junction with the sclerotic. The anterior surface of the cornea is slightly less exten- sive than the posterior, owing to its being overlapped by the sclerotic. Supported by the aqueous humour, it is tense and nearly spherical diuing life ; but its radius of curvature varies in different individuals, and in the same person at different ages, being shorter in the young. After death it becomes flaccid from the transudation of the aqueous humour ; or if the eye is immersed in water, it is rendered opaque by infiltration of the tissue by that fluid. Structure. The substance of the cornea is composed of a special kind of connective tissue, arranged in irregular layers. Over the front the conjunctiva (which is here reduced to its epithelium) is continued ; and covering the back of the cornea proper is a very thin elastic stratum known as the membrane of Descemet. The latter may be peeled off, after a cut has been made through it, in shreds which curl up with the attached surface innermost. At the circumference of the cornea the membrane of Descemet breaks up into processes (pillars of the iris or ligamentum pectinatum iridis) which are partly reflected on to the front of the iris, and partly join the sclerotic and choroid coats. In the healthy condition the blood-vessels do not permeate the cornea, but cease in capillary loops at the circumference. Numerous tine branches of the ciliary nerves ramify in its substance.719 CHOROID COAT. Vascular Coat of the Eyeball (fig. 224).

Dissection. Supposing the cornea of an eye cut through circularly Dissection rr ° . , . i j_i j.1 to see the as before directed (p. 717), it will be necessary to take away the choroid sclerotic to lay bare the choroid coat. With the point of the scalpel, portion, or with a shut scissors, detach the fore part of the sclerotic from the front of the choroid by breaking through a soft whitish structure uniting them. Then, the eye being put into water, the outer coat is to be removed by cutting it away piece-meal with the scissors ; in taking it off, the slender vessels and nerves beneath are to be pre- served. The white ring round the eye in front, which comes into view during the dissection, is the ciliary muscle. For the purpose of obtaining a front view of the ciliary pro- J° cesses, which are connected with the anterior tennination of the cho- processed roid coat, let the cornea be removed as before on another eyeball. Detach next the fore part of the sclerotic from the choroid ; and after three or four cuts have been made in it towards the optic nerve, the resulting flaps may be pinned out, so as to support the eye in an upright position. On removing with care the iris, taking it away by an from the centre towards the circumference, the ciliary processes be- anterior neath will be displayed. A posterior view of the processes may be and a pos- prepared on another ball by cutting through it circularly with e 101 w" scissors, about one-third of an inch behind the cornea, so that the anterior can be removed from the posterior half; on taking away the portion of the vitreous mass adherent to the anterior part of the ball, and washing off the pigment from the back of the iris, the small processes will be made manifest. By means of the last dissection the interior of the choroid coat may be seen. If a vertical section is made of another eyeball, it will show the To make a ciliary processes in their natural position, and will demonstrate the section' relative situation of all the parts. This section, which is made witli difficulty, should be attempted in water with a sharp large knife, and on a surface of wax or wood, after the cornea and sclerotic have been cut with a scissors. When the eye has been divided, the halves shoidd remain in water. The choroid coat (fig. 223,6) is a thin membrane of a dark colour, Choroid: and extends from the optic nerve to the fore part of the eyeball, extent; When viewed on the eye in which the ciliary muscle is entire, it anterior appears to terminate there ; but it may lie seen in the other dissec-tormination; lions to pass inwards behind that muscle, and to end in a scries of projections (ciliary processes) at the back of the iris.

The inner surface is smooth, and is lined by the thin dark pigmen- Fig. 224." tary layer of the retina (fig. 223). Posteriorly it is pierced by a round aperture for the passage of the optic nerve ; and anterior! y it joins the iris. The ciliary processes (fig. 225, b) are solid projections on the inner surface of the choroid coat, disposed radially, and forming a circle beneath the ciliary muscle and the outer margin of the iris. About seventy in number, they comprise larger and smaller eminences, the former being the more numerous, and having a length of about one-tenth of an inch. They increase in depth from with- out inwards ; and at their inner ends they are united by transverse ridges. By their free extremities the processes bound peripherally the space (posterior chamber; fig. 226, i) behind the iris; in front, they correspond to the ciliary muscle, and at their inner ends to the back of the iris ; while behind, they are closely applied to the membrane on the front of the vitreous body (suspensory ligament of the lens ; fig. 226, t), and fit into hollows between eminences on the anterior surface of that structure. Structure. The choroid coat and its ciliary processes are composed of blood-vessels supported by pigmented areolar tissue.

In the ciliary processes the meshes of the capillary net- work are larger, and the interstitial pigment disappears towards the free ends of the larger processes. Ciliary muscle (fig. 224, d, e). In the eye from which the sclerotic coat has been removed, the white ring of the ciliary muscle may be seen covering the front of the choroid coat. The muscle forms a circular band, of a greyish white colour, and position; about one-tenth of an inch wide, ciliary processes. Ciliary muscle : Fig. 225." on the surface of the choroid coat, close to the outer margin of the iris. It consists of un- striated fibres, which are in two sets, radiating and circular :— The radiating fibres (fig. 226, e) arise in front from the sclerotic coat close to the junction with the cornea (beneath ?•), and are directed backwards, spreading out, to be inserted into the choroid coat opposite to, and a little behind, the ciliary pro- cesses. Some of the deeper fibres become transverse, and pass gradually into the following set. The circular fibres are beneath the bundle (fig. 226, m) surrounding the edge of the iris, opposite the inner part of the ciliary processes. Action. The ciliary muscle draws forwards the fore part of the choroid coat and the ciliary processes, and relaxes the suspensory ligament of the lens, thereby allowing the lens to become more con- vex, as required for vision at near distances. The ciliary muscle is therefore the muscle of accommodation, consists of radiatiDg radiating, and form a narrow and circular fibres ; The iris (fig. 224, c) is a vascular and muscular structure, about iris is vas- cular and muscular; half an inch in diameter, the vessels of which are continuous with those of the choroid coat. Its position and relations may be observed in the different dissections that have been prepared. Placed within the ring of the ciliary muscle, it is suspended in front of the lens (fig. 223, /), and is pierced by an aperture for the transmission of the light. It is circular in form, is variously coloured in different persons, and is immersed in the aqueous humour.

The anterior surface is free in the aqueous humour, and is marked by lines converging towards the pupil. The posterior surface is covered with a thick layer of pigment (fig. 226), to which the term uvea has been applied. The aperture in it (fig. 224) is the pupil of the eye ; this is slightly internal to the centre, and is nearly circular in form ; but its size is constantly varying (from -^th to -§- of an inch) by the contraction of the muscular fibres, according to the degree of lioht acting on the retina. Membrane of the pupil. In the foetus the aperture of the pupil is closed by a vascular transparent membrane, which is attached to the edge of the iris, and di- Fig. 226.* vides into two distinct chambers the space in which the iris is sus- pended. The vessels in it are continuous behind with those of the iris and the case of the lens. About the eighth month the vessels become imper- vious, and at the time of birth only fragments of the structure remain. Structure. The stroma of the iris is composed of connective tissue, the fibres of which are directed for the most part radially towards the pupil. In it are involuntary muscular fibres, both circular and radiating, together with pigment- cells ; and vessels and nerves ramify through the tissue. Muscular fibres. The sphmcier of the pupil (fig. 225, d) is a narrow band about -Jg-tli of an inch wide, which is close to the pupil, on the posterior aspect of the iris. The dilator of the pupil (e) consists of bundles of fibres which begin at the outer border of the iris, and end internally in the sphincter. Action. Enlargement of the pupil is effected by shortening of the radiating fibres ; and diminution, by contraction of the circular ring. The movements of the iris are involuntary, and regulate the admis- sion of light into the ball. The pigment of the iris is partly interspersed in the substance of the membrane, and partly collected into a thick layer on the posterior aspect, the above-mentioned uvea, which is continuous with the pigmentary stratum of the retina. The colour of the iris depends upon the nature and quantity of the interspersed pigment. * Enlarged representation of the parts of the eyeball on one side opposite the lens : the letters refer to the same parts as in fig. 223. d.

The arteries of the iris (fig. 227, b) have a looped arrangement: they are derived chiefly from the long and the anterior ciliary branches (d), hut some come from the vessels of the ciliary processes. On arriving at the ciliary muscle, the long and anterior ciliary arteries form a circle (e) round the margin of the iris; from this ring other anastomotic branches are directed towards the pupil, near which they join in a second arterial circle (/). From the last circle capillaries run to the edge of the pupil, and end in veins. The veins resemble the arteries in their arrangement in the 227.* iris, and terminate in the veins of the choroid coat. The nerves of the iris are the terminal branches of the ciliary nerves : they divide into branches which accompany the blood-vessels, and communicate with one another so as to form a plexus which gets gradually finer towards the pupil (fig. 227, a). Ciliary vessels and nerves (fig. 224). The ciliary arteries are offsets of the ophthalmic (p. 45), and supply the choroid, the ciliary processes, and the iris. They are classed into posterior and anterior, and two of the first set are named long ciliary ; but they will not be seen without a special injection of the vessels of the eye. The posterior ciliary arteries (g) pierce the sclerotic coat around and close to the optic nerve, and running forwards ou the choroid, divide into branches which enter its substance at different points. Two of this set (long ciliary) are directed forwards between the sclerotic and choroid, one on each side of the eyeball, and form a circle round the iris in the ciliary muscle, as before explained. In the ball the outer one lies rather above, and the inner, rather below the middle. The anterior ciliary arteries, five or six in number, are smaller than the posterior, and arise at the front of the orbit from muscular branches (p. 46) ; they pierce the sclerotic coat about a line behind the cornea, supply the ciliary processes, and join the circle of the long ciliary vessels. In inflammation of the iris these vessels are enlarged, and offsets of them form a ring round the cornea. The posterior ciliary veins have a different arrangement from the arteries. The branches form arches (vasa vorticosa ; fig. 224, 7i) in * Distribution of the nerves and vessels of the iris. a. Half of the iris showing the nerves, a.

The anterior ciliary veins begin in a plexus within the ciliary muscle, receiving tributaries from the iris and the ciliary processes, and accompany the arteries through the sclerotic to end in the oph- thalmic trunks : they communicate with the venous space of the canal of Schlemm (p. 718). The ciliary nerves (fig. 224, /) are derived from the lenticular ganglion, and the nasal nerve (p. 45). Entering the back of the eyeball with the arteries, they are continued with the vessels between the sclerotic and choroid as far as the ciliary muscle : at this spot the nerves send offsets to the cornea, and piercing the fibres of the ciliary muscle, enter the iris. Offsets from the nerves supply the ciliary muscle and the choroid, and fine twigs enter the sclerotic. Chamber of the Aqueous Humour (fig. 223).' The space between the cornea in front and the lens behind, in which the ins is suspended, contains a clear fluid named the aqueous humour. In the fcetus before the seventh month this interval is separated into two by the ins and the pupillary membrane ; but in the adult it is only partly divided, for the two communicate through the pupil. The boun- daries of the two chambers may be seen in the eye on which a vertical section has been made. The anterior chamber is the larger of the two ; it is limited in front by the cornea, and behind by the iris. The posterior chamber (i) is a narrow interval behind the iris at the circumference, which is bounded in front by the iris ; behind by the lens capsule, and by a piece of the membrane (suspensory ligament of the lens) on the front of the vitreous humour; and at the circumference by the ciliary processes. The Eetina (fig. 223, c). This layer is the innermost and most delicate of the coats of the eyeball, and is situate between the choroid coat and the transparent mass (vitreous) in the interior. It consists of two parts, viz., a thin membrane internally, continuous with the optic nerve, and a pigmentary layer outside, which adheres to the choroid coat. Dissection. The retina can be satisfactorily examined only on an eye which is obtained within forty-eight hours after death. To bring it into view on the eyeball in which the middle coat was dissected, the choroid must be torn away carefully with two pairs of forceps, while the eye is immersed in fluid. In this dissection the pigmentary layer separates from the nervous portion of the retina, and is removed with the choroid coat. The pigmentary portion of the retina is a very thin, dark layeT, which lines closely the inner surface of the choroid coat, and is continued over the ciliary processes into the uvea on the posterior surface of the iris (fig. 226). The nervous portion of the retina is a soft membrane of a pinkish grey tint and semitransparent when fresh ; but it soon loses this725 ANATOMY OF THE RETINA.

In the living state, however, the retina y"^^0 0111 is characterized by the existence of a purplish red colour, which is discharged under the influence of sunlight. This part of the retina extends over about the posterior two-thirds of the eyeball, reaching extent; from the entrance of the optic nerve to the outer extremities of the ciliary processes, where it ends in an irregular wavy border—the ora serrata. Its thickness diminishes from behind forwards. thickness; The outer surface of the dissected retina is slightly flocculent, outer owing to the tearing away of the pigmentary layer. The inner sur face is smooth : it is covered with folds in a preparation of the eye cut in two, but these are accidental, in consequence of the membrane having lost its proper support. At the spot where the optic nerve expands (porus opticus, optic disc ; fig. 228) the surface is slightly elevated (papilla optica); but in the centre of this is a slight ex- cavation where the central vessels ap- pear. In the interior of the human eye, in the axis of the ball, is a slightly elliptical yellow area (fig. 228), one-twelfth of an inch in diameter, which is named the yellow spot (macula lutea). Almost in the yellow spot, centre of this spot is a minute hollow, the fovea centralis, which and central appears black in consequence of the thinness of the wall allowing lovea' the dark pigment outside to be seen. From the ora serrata a very thin layer is continued on as far as Ciliary the tips of the ciliary processes : it is called the ciliary part of the f.^^ retina, but does not consist of nervous substance. It is not visible to the naked eye. For a description of the structure of the retina, the student is re- ferred to a work dealing with microscopic anatomy. Vessels of the retina. The central artery of the retina, accompanied Artery of by its vein, enters the eyeball through the optic nerve (p. 45). In retina the central depression of the optic papilla the artery divides into has four four primary branches,—two inner or nasal (upper and lower), and inches • two outer or temporal (also upper and lower). The outer branches are the larger, and follow an arched course above and below the yellow spot : all ramify in the innermost part of the nervous coat. No vessels enter the pigmentary layer. The veins have a similar arrangement. In the fmtus a branch of the artery passes through the centre of another in the vitreous mass to supply the lens-capsule. foetus. Vitreous Body. This is a soft transparent mass which fills the Vitreous body. * Objects on the inner surface of the retina.

The vitreous body may he seen on the eye on which the retina was dissected, by taking away the retina, the iris, and the ciliary muscle and processes. To obtain a view of its anterior part, with the lens in situation, an eyeball should be fixed upright, and the sclerotic and choroid coats cut through about a quarter of an inch behind the cornea ; then on removing carefully the cornea, the ciliary muscle and pro- cesses, and the iris, the vitreous body will be apparent. The vitreous body (fig. 223, h) is globular in form, and fills about four-fifths of the ball, supporting the retina. In front it is slightly hollowed, and receives the lens with its capsule (g), to which it is closely united. It is composed of a thin watery jelly, contained in a transparent membrane named hyaloid. The jelly consists in great part of fluid, which drains away when the vitreous body is exposed on a flat surface, or placed on a filter, and only a very small amount of solid matter remains ; but whether in the natural state it possesses any definite structure is uncertain. In the central part of the vitreous body, however, there is a canal filled with fluid (hyaloid canal), which extends from the optic papilla of the retina to the back of the lens-capsule, and served in the fcetus for the transmission of the capsular branch of the central artery of the retina. This canal is not visible without special preparation. The hyaloid membrane (n) is the thin, glassy, structureless layer enclosing the vitreous body, except at the fore part where the lens is placed. At the bottom of the ball, around the optic papilla, the membrane is closely connected with the retina ; and it sends a pro- longation forwards to line the canal of the vitreous. In front, the membrane becomes thicker as it approaches the ciliary processes, and is continued into the suspensory ligament of the lens. The vitreous mass and the hyaloid membrane are extravascular, and receive their nutritive material from the vessels of the ciliary processes and retina. Suspensory ligament op the lens (Zonule of Zinn). This is a transparent membranous structure (fig. 226, f), placed around the lens-capsule, which joins externally the hyaloid membrane opposite the anterior termination (ora serrata) of the retina. After the ciliary processes of the choroid coat are detached from it, dark lines of pigment cover the surface; and when these are washed away, plaits (ciliary processes) come into view, which are less prominent and longer than the processes of the choroid coat; but do not quite reach the lens-capsule internally. The two sets of prominences are dovetailed together,—the projections of one being received into hollows between the other; and in the fresh state the two structures are closely adherent. The membrane contains numerous si ill' radiating fibres, which internally become collected into bundles,* and are attached to the margin, and the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the lens-capsule. The tenseness is influenced by the state of the ciliary muscle, for during its contraction the727 LENS AND ITS CAPSULE. membrane is rendered lax by the drawing forwards of the ciliary processes.

The lens is situate behind the pupil of Lens of the the eye (fig. 223, </), and brings to a focus on the retina the rays of eyeba11- light entering through that aperture. The capsule is a firm and very elastic transparent case, which Capsule of closely surrounds the lens proper. The anterior surface (fig. 223) relati * f is free, and projects towards the pupil, around which it touches the anterior iris ; but externally the two are separated by a small interval—the surfacei posterior chamber (i) ; close to the margin of the lens it is joined by the suspensory ligament (t). The posterior surface is received posterior into a hollow on the front of the vitreous body, to which it is surface> inseparably united. The circumference of the case gives attachment and 5ir- curnttrencp * to the posterior fibres of the suspensory ligament, and behind this bounds the canal of Petit (o).

The lens will be obtained by cutting across the thin Open cap- membranous capsule in which it is enclosed. sule of lens- The lens is a solid and transparent doubly convex body ; but the Surfaces are curves are unequal on the two surfaces (fig. 223, g), the posterior equally"" being greater than the anterior. Its margin is somewhat rounded ; and the measurement from side to side is one-third of an inch, but dimensions; from before back about one-fifth of an inch. The density increases density; from the circumference to the centre; for while the superficial layers may be rubbed off with the finger, the deeper portion is firm, and is named the nucleus. On each surface are three lines diverging from the centre, and lines on the reaching towards the margin; they are the edges of planes or surfaces; " septa," where the ends of the lens-fibres meet, and are so situate that those on one side are intermediate in position to those on the other. In the human eye they are not distinctly seen, because they bifurcate repeatedly as they extend outwards. Structure. After the lens has been hardened by spirit or boiling, structure it may be demonstrated to consist of a series of layers (fig. 229) is laminar arranged one within another, like those of an onion. The laminse of each surface have their apices in the centre, where the septa meet; they may be detached from one another at that spot, and turned outwards towards the equator of the lens.

The form of the lens is nearly spherical in the foetus; but its convexity decreases with age, particularly on the anterior surface, until it becomes flattened in the adult. In the foetus it is soft, rather reddish in colour, and not quite transparent; in mature age it is firm and clear ; and in old age it becomes flatter on both sur- faces, denser, and of a yellowish colour. * A representation of the laminae in a hardened lens. a.

It is apparatus, commonly divided into three parts, known as the external ear, the middle ear, and the internal ear. Of these, the last is the essential portion, containing the terminal expansion of the auditory nerve ; and the others are to be regarded as accessory, serving to convey to it the vibrations produced by the sonorous undulations of the air. External Ear. This includes the pinna or auricle and the Parts of auditory canal: the former has been noticed at p. 33, and theouterear" latter remains to be described. The external auditory canal (meatus auditorius externus; fig. ^^?ry 230) is the passage which leads from the pinna towards the tympanic cavity (a part of the middle ear), from which it is separated in the recent state by the tympanic membrane. Dissection. To obtain a view of this canal, a recent temporal how to ob- bone is to be taken, to which the cartilaginous pinna remains ew attached. After the removal of the soft parts, the squamous piece of the bone in front of the Glaserian fissure is to be sawn off; and the front of the meatus, except a ring at the inner end which gives support to the thin membrana tympani, is to be cut away with a bone-forceps. The canal (fig. 230) is about one inch and a quarter in length, length, and is formed partly by bone, and partly by cartilage. It is directed forwards somewhat obliquely, and describes a slight vertical curve direction, with the convexity upwards. In shape it is rather flattened from size and before backwards ; and it is narrowest in the osseous portion. The suaPe; outer extremity is continuous with a hollow (concha) of the external ear, and the inner is closed by the membrana tympani. The cartilaginous part (a) is largest. It is about half an inch in cartilagi- length, and is formed chiefly by the pinna of the outer ear, which is "ous part attached to the margin of the osseous meatus ; but at the upper and is deficient posterior aspect the cartilage is deficient, and the tube is closed by abovo' fibrous tissue. One or two fissures (fissures of Santorini) cross the cartilage (p. 35). The osseous part (b) is about three-quarters of an inch long in the ossoous adult, and is slightly constricted about the middle. Its outer1,art' extremity is dilated, and the posterior edge projects farther than the outer «nd730 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. anterior ; the greater portion of the margin is rough, and gives at- inner end. tachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is smaller, and is marked in the dry hone, except at the upper part where there is a notch in the osseous margin, hy a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall and the floor extend inwards beyond the hinder wall and the roof for nearly a quarter of an inch.

After birth the osseous wall is completed by an outgrowth from the ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. Fig. 230.* Lining Lining of the meatus.

The chief part of the middle ear is the tympanum Middle ear or drum, a cavity containing air, which is interposed between the tympanum, external auditory canal and the labyrinth or internal ear. The space is traversed by a chain of small bones, with which special muscles and ligaments are connected. It communicates in front with the pharynx by a canal named the Eustachian tube ; and Eustachian behind, it is prolonged into a series of excavations in the mastoid j^de'mastoid part of the temporal bone—the mastoid cells. Small vessels and cells nerves ramify in the cavity. Dissection. The tympanic cavity should be examined in both a Dissection dried and a recent bone. On the dry temporal bone, after removing most of the squamous *° °g;n !t in portion by means of a vertical cut of the saw through the root of bone> the zygoma and the Glaserian fissure, the tympanum will be brought into view by cutting away with the bone-forceps some of the upper surface of the petrous portion, and the anterior part of the meatus auditorius. In the recent bone prepare the dissection as above, but without and in the doing injury to the membrana tympani, the chorda tympani nerve, recent bone- and the chain of bones with its muscles. The tympanum has the form of a very short cylinder, which is Tympanum: placed obliquely, so that its end-surfaces (the inner and outer walls f01'm aml of the tympanum) are nearer to the median plane in front than behind. The circumference of the cylinder is somewhat irregular, and interrupted at parts : in it a roof, a floor, and an anterior and a posterior wall are distinguished. The cavity measures about half dimensions, an inch from above down and from before back. Its breadth may be given as one-sixth of an inch ; but it is wider above and behind than at the lower and fore parts ; and it is narrowest in the centre, owing to the projection towards the cavity of the promontory on the inner wall, and of the tympanic membrane externally. The inner boundary of the tympanum (fig. 231) is formed by the inner wall oiiter wall of the osseous labyrinth, by the parts of which the con- formation of this surface is mainly determined. Occupying the greater part of the inner wall is a rounded eminence called the is marked by promontory (pr) ; this becomes narrow behind, and its surface is Promontory marked by two or three minute grooves which lodge the nerves of and grooves; the tympanic plexus. Above and below the narrowed end of the promontory is an aperture : both lead into the labyrinth. The upper aperture (/o) is semicircular in shape, with the con- fenestra vexity upwards, and is named fenestra ovalis : it opens into the ovalis; vestibule, and into it the inner bone (stapes) of the chain is fixed. The lower aperture, fenestra rotunda (/r), is rather triangular in fenestra form, and is situate within a funnel-shaped hollow: in the macerated rotunda bone it leads into the cochlea ; but in the recent state it is closed by a thin membrane—the secondary membrane of the tympanum. Arching above the fenestra ovalis on this wall is a ridge of bone ridge of (c/*) which marks the situation of the aqueduct of Fallopius, and SSSSS"732 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. contains the facial nerve.

The aperture by which the teudon of the muscle escapes is placed a little above and in front of the fenestra ovalis. The outer boundary of the cavity is formed by the membrana tympani (fig. 230, c), and the surrounding bone.

Crossing the membrane towards the upper part is the chorda tympani nerve, which issues through a special aperture close to the Glaserian fissure. The roof (tegmen tympani; fig. 231, tt) is a thin plate of bone ^r°^gs separating the tympanic cavity from the cranium. It occasionally perforated, presents one or more apertures, where the mucous lining of the tympanum comes into contact with the dura mater. The floor separates the tympanum from the jugular fossa Moor is (fig. 231, jf), and is more or less excavated by small cells, which cel1 ar' are extensions of the tympanic cavity, and lined by a prolongation of its mucous membrane. An anterior wall is present only to the lower half of the space, in front is which it separates from the carotid canal (fig. 231, cc) ; in the g^ei^l™°n upper half is the tympanic orifice of the Eustachian tube. tube. The posterior wall is similarly deficient in the upper half, where Behind are there is a large aperture leading into a space called the antrum antrum mastoideum (fig. 231, am), from which the mastoid cells are given mast0ldeum off. Below this opening, but near the inner wall, and on a level with the narrow part of the promontory, is the small conical projec- and ' tion of the pyramid (py). At the summit of the pyramid is a small orifice, from which a canal leads backwards and downwards to the aqueduct of Fallopius : the canal lodges the stapedius muscle, with canal Sometimes there is a slender round bar of bone connecting the otstare-llus- pyramid to the promontory (fig. 231). Some objects that have been referred to above, viz., the membrana tympani, the Eustachian tube, the mastoid cells, and the secondary tympanic, membrane, require separate notice. The membrana tymfani (fig. 232) is a thin translucent disc Tympanic between the external auditory canal and the cavity of the tympanum. mem 'a'u ' It is rather elliptical in shape, and its longest diameter, which is form and directed from above down, measures about two-fifths of an inch. slze By its circumference it is attached to a groove at the inner end of attachment; the auditory passage. In the foetus it is supported by a separate osseous ring—the tympanic bone (fig. 232, /). The membrane is position ; placed very obliquely, so that it forms an angle of about 45° with both a horizontal and a sagittal plane, the outer surface looking downwards and forwards. It is concave towards the auditory canal, is rather being sloped inwards from the circumference to the centre ; and it jjj'apcli. projects into the cavity of the tympanum.

The membrane is formed of three strata,—external, K consists internal, and middle. The outer one is continuous with the integu- neons"1*" ments of the meatus auditorius ; and the inner is derived from the a m"c""8. i_ <• .1 ™ .... and a fibrous mucous membrane of the tympanum. The middle layer is formed layer. of fibrous tissue, and is fixed to the groove in the bone. From its centre, where it is firmly united to the extremity of the handle of the malleus, fibres radiate towards the circumference ; and near the margin, at the inner aspect, lies a band of stronger circular fibres734 DISSECTION OF THE EAR.

Membrane in fenestra rotunda : construc- tion (fig. 232, c), which bridges across the notch at the upper part of the tympanic bone. Occupying the notch above-mentioned in the upper part of the osseous margin (notch of Rivinus), there is a small piece of the membrane which is softer and looser than the rest (membrana flaccida), being formed only by lax connective tissue between the skin and the mucous membrane. The Eustachian tube (fig. 230, e) is the channel through which the tympanic cavity communicates with the external air. It is about an inch and a half in length, and is directed forwards and inwards, as well as somewhat downwards, to the pharynx. Like the meatus auditorius, it is partly osseous and partly cartilaginous in texture. The osseous part is rather more than half an inch in length, and is narrowest at its anterior end. Its course in the temporal bone is along the angle of union of the squamous and petrous portions, outside the passage for the carotid artery. Anteriorly it ends in a somewhat oval opening, with an irregular margin, which gives attachment to the cartilage. The cartilaginous part of the tube is nearly an inch in length, and extends from the temporal bone to the interior of the pharynx (p. 125). Through this tube the mucous membrane of the drum of the ear is continuous with that of the pharynx ; and through it the mucus escapes. The mastoid cells are air-spaces occupying the interior of the temporal bone behind the tympanum and the external auditory meatus. They reach downwards into the mastoid process, and up- wards for a short distance into the adjoining region of the squamous portion of the bone. In front they communicate with the tympanum through asmall chamber named the antrum mastoideum (fig. 231, am). Their size and extent vary greatly in different individuals; and in some cases they are separated only by a very thin layer of bone from the exterior of the skull on the one side, and from the lateral sinus on the other. In the infant the mastoid antrum is present, but the cells are not formed ; the latter are developed at, or a little before, the period of puberty. The SECONDARY MEMBRANE OF THE TYMPANUM is placed in the fenestra rotunda, and is rather concave towards the tympanum, but convex towards the cochlear passage which it closes. It is formed of three strata, like the membrane on the opposite side of the cavity, viz., an external or mucous, derived from the * Inner -view of the membrana tympani in the foetus, with the malleus attached, a.

The outer one is num are named malleus from its resemblance to a mallet; the next, incus, three, being compared to an anvil; and the last, stapes, from its likeness to a stirrup. For their examination the student should be provided with some separate ossicles. The malleus (fig. 233) is the longest bone, and is twisted and Malleus lias bent. It is large at the upper part (head ; a), and small and pointed below (handle ; c) ; and it has two processes, with a narrowed part Fig. 233.* or neck. The liead or capitulum (a) is free in the cavity, is club- head, shaped, and at the back has a depression for articulation with the next bone. The neck (b) is the constricted part between the head neck, and the processes. The handle or manubrium (c) decreases in size handle, towards the tip, and is compressed from before backwards ; but at the extremity it is flattened from within outwards : to its outer margin the special fibrous stratum of the membrana tympani is connected. The short process (e) springs from the root of the handle on the short outer side, and is attached to the upper border of the tympanic membrane where it bridges across the notch of Eivinus. The long and long process (processus gracilis ; cl) is during infancy a slender flattened P10068,8, piece of bone, which projects from the neck of the malleus at the anterior aspect, and extends into the Glaserian fissure ; in the adult this process is most frequently converted into a fibrous band ; and in cases where the osseous process persists, it is joined with the sur- rounding bone, and cannot be separated. The incus is a flattened bone (fig. 233), and consists of a body Incus: and two processes. The body (b) is hollowed at the fore part (a) to body; articulate with the malleus. The short process (c) is somewhat processes, conical, and projects backwards nearly horizontally; its extremity rests against the lower and inner part of the margin bounding the opening into the mastoid antrum. The long process (d) is almost and long. * The three tympanic ossicles of the right side : the central bone is the malleus, the left-hand one, incus, and the right-hand one stapes.

Membrane in aperture of stupes. vertical, and descends parallel to the handle of the malleus, behind and internal to which it lies : it diminishes towards the extremity, where it is bent inwards, and ends in a small flattened knob—the orbicular process (e), for articulation with the stapes. The stapes (fig. 233) has a base or wider portion, and a head, with two sides or crura, like a stirrup. The base (d) is directed inwards, and is a thin osseous plate, convex at the upper margin and nearly straight at the lower, corresponding with the shape of the fenestra ovalis, into which it is received : the surface turned to the vestibule is convex, while the opposite is excavated. The head (a) is marked at the extremity by a superficial depression, which articulates with the orbicular process of the incus ; and it is sup- ported on a slightly constricted part, the neck (b). The crura extend horizontally from the neck to the base, and are grooved on the sur- face towards the enclosed aperture : the anterior crus (c) is shorter and straighter than the posterior. Ligaments of the ossicles. The small bones of the tympanic cavity are united into one chain by joints, and are farther kept in position by ligaments fixing them to the surrounding wall. Joints of the bones. Where the ossicles touch, they are connected together by articulations corresponding with the joints of larger bones ; for the osseous surfaces are covered with cartilage, are sur- rounded by a thin capsular ligament of fibrous tissue, and lubricated by a synovial sac. One articulation of this nature exists between the head of the malleus and the incus, and a second between the orbicu- lar process of the incus and the head of the stapes. Union of the bones to the wall. The bones are kept in place by the reflection of the mucous membrane over them, and by the following ligaments, three being connected with the malleus, and one each with the incus and stapes :— Ligaments of the malleus. The superior or suspensory ligament is a slender band which descends from the roof of the tympanum to the head of the malleus. The anterior ligament is the strongest of all: it passes from the fore part of the neck of the malleus to a projection at the anterior margin of the notch of Rivinus, and to the sides of the Glaserian fissure. A part of this ligament entering the fissure has been described as a muscle under the name of laxator tympani. The external ligament is short and fan-shaped : its fibres radiate from the outer and posterior parts of the neck of the malleus to the edge of the notch. The ligament of the incus attaches the extremity of the short process of that bone to the tympanic wall at the lower part of the orifice of the antrum mastoideum. The annular ligament of the stapes is composed of veiy short fibres, which unite the circumference of the base of the stirrup to the margin of the fenestra ovalis. Special ligament of the stapes. Closing the interval between the crura of the stapes there is a very thin membrane which is attached' to the groove of the bone. It is covered above and below by the mucous membrane.737 MUSCLES OF THE OSSICLES. Muscles of the ossicles (fig. 234). Two muscles are connected with the chain of bones, one being attached to the malleus, the other to the stapes. The tensor tympani (fig. 234, h) is the larger of the two mus- cles of the tympanum, and takes the shape of its containing tube, which must be laid open to see it completely. The muscle arises in Fig. 234.* front from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and the posterior extremity of the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and it also receives fibres from the surface of its bony canal. Posteriorly it ends in a tendon which is reflected over the end of the cochleariform pro- cess, and is inserted into the inner border of the handle of the malleus near its base. Action. The muscle draws in- wards the handle of the malleus towards the inner wall of the tympanic cavity, and tightens the membrane of the tympanum ; and as the long process of the incus is moved inwards with the malleus, the base of the stapes will be pressed into the fenestra ovalis. The stapedius (fig. 234, i) is lodged in the canal hollowed in the interior of the pyramid. Arising inside the tube, the muscle ends in a small tendon, which issues at the apex of the pyramid, and is inserted into the back of the head of the stapes. Action. By directing the neck of the stapes backwards, the muscle raises the fore part of the base out of the fenestra ovalis, diminishing the pressure on the fluid in the vestibule ; and supposing it to con- tract simultaneously with the tensor, it would prevent the sudden jar of the stapes on that fluid. Mucous membrane of the tympanum. The mucous lining of the tympanic cavity adheres closely to the wall; it is continuous with that of the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, and is pro- longed into the mastoid cells through the antrum. It forms part of the membrana tympani, and of the secondary mem- brane in the fenestra rotunda ; it is reflected also over the chain of bones, the muscles, ligaments, and chorda tympani nerve.

Blood-vessels. The arteries of the tympanum are furnished from the following branches of the external carotid, viz., internal maxil- lary, posterior auricular, and ascending pharyngeal; and some offsets come from the internal carotid in the temporal bone. The veins join the pterygoid plexus, and the large meningeal and pharyngeal branches. The internal maxillary artery supplies an anterior tympanic branch (fig. 232, d ; p. 88), which enters the cavity through the Glase- rian fissure, and furnishes a branch to the membrane of the tympanum; The middle meningeal artery also sends fine twigs to the upper part of the tympanum through small apertures in the roof of the cavity. The stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery (p. 80), entering the lower end of the aqueduct of Fallopius, gives twigs to the back of the cavity, and the mastoid cells. One of this set, pos- terior tympanic (fig. 232, e), anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery, and forms a circle around the mem- brana tympani, from which offsets are directed inwards. Other branches from the ascending pharyngeal, or from the in- ferior palatine artery, enter the fore part of the space by the Eustachian tube. One or two minute branches of the internal carotid artery reach the anterior wall of the tympanum from the carotid canal (p. 105). Nerves. The lining membrane of the tympanum is supplied from the plexus (tympanic) between Jacobson's and the sympathetic nerve ; but the muscles derive their nerves from other sources. Crossing the cavity is the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. Dissection (fig. 235). The preparation of the tympanic plexus will require a separate fresh temporal bone, which has been softened in diluted hydrochloric acid, and in which the nerves have been hardened afterwards in spirit. The origin of Jacobson's nerve from the glossopharyngeal is first to be sought close to the skull; and the fine auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric may be looked for at the same time (p. 107). Sup- posing the nerve to be found, the student should place the scalpel on the outer side of the Eustachian tube, and carry it backwards through the vaginal and styloid processes of the temporal bone, so as to take away the outer part of the tympanum, but without opening the lower end of the aqueduct of Fallopius. After the tympanum has been laid open, Jacobson's nerve is to be followed in its canal; and the branches in the grooves on the surface of the promontory are to be pursued ;—two of these, arching forwards, pass to the sympathetic on the carotid artery and to the Eustachian tube ; and two others are directed upwards beneath the tensor tympani muscle. The course of the chorda tympani nerve can be seen on the preparation used for the muscles.739 NERVES OF TYMPANUM.

In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining membrane, membrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Eustachian tube ; and it terminates in the three undermentioned ^ln°^r branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and v{Z i connect this nerve with others.

Nerves to muscles. The tensor tympani muscle is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion (fig. 235, ,J); and the stapedius re- ceives an offset from the facial trunk. The chorda tympani (fig. 235, R) is a branch of the facial nerve (p. 145). Entering the cavity behind, it crosses the membrana tympani, lying on the inner side of the handle of the malleus, and issues from the space by an aperture internal to the Glaserian fissure ; it joins the lingual nerve, and its i art her course to the tongue is described at page 92. The auricular branch of the vagus, though not a nerve of the tympanum, may now be traced in the softened bone. Arising in the jugular fossa (p. 110), the nerve enters a special canal, and crosses through the substance of the temporal bone to the back of the ear. Internal Ear or Labyrinth. The inner portion of the organ of hearing consists of a complex chamber surrounded by dense bone, within which are included sacs containing fluid, for the terminal expansion of the auditory nerve. The Osseous Labyrinth comprises the vestibule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea : in the macerated bone these communicate externally with the tympanum, and internally, through the meatus auditorius internus, with the cranial cavity. The vestibule (rig. 236), or the central cavity of the osseous labyrinth, is placed behind the cochlea, but in front of the semi- circular canals. Dissection. This space may be seen on the dry bone which has been used for the preparation of the tympanum. The bone is to be sawn through vertically close to the inner wall of the tympanum, so as to lay bare the fenestra ovalis leading into the vestibide. By enlarging the fenestra ovalis a very little in a direction upwards and forwards, the vestibular space will appear ; and the end of the superior semicircular canal will be opened. Other views of the cavity may be obtained by sections of the temporal bone in different directions, according to the opportunities and skill of the dissector. The vestibular space (fig. 236) is ovoidal in form, and the. ex- tremities are directed forwards and backwards. The larger end is turned back, and the under part or floor is more narrowed than the upper part or roof. It measures about one-fifth of an inch in length ; but it is narrower from without inwards. The following objects are to be noted on the boundaries of the space. In front, close to the outer wall, is a large aperture (g) leading into the cochlea ; and behind are five round openings of the three semicircular canals (d, e, /). The outer wall corresponds with the tympanum, and in it is the aperture of the fenestra ovalis. On the inner wall, nearer the front, than the back of the cavity, is a vertical ridge or crest (b). In front of the crest is a circular depression, fovea herndspherica (a),741 OSSEOUS LABYRINTH. which is pierced by minute apertures for nerves and vessels, and corresponds with the bottom of the internal auditory meatus. Be- hind the crest of bone, near the common opening of two of the semicircular canals, is the aperture of the aqueduct of the vestibule (c), a narrow canal which ends on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it contains a process of the membra- nous labyrinth called the ductus endolymphaticus, and a small vein.

From a difference in the direction of the tubes, they have been named superior vertical, posterior vertical, and horizontal. The superior vertical canal (a) crosses the upper border of the petrous part of the temporal Fig. 237-* hone, and forms a projection on the surface. Its outer end is marked by the ampulla, while the inner is joined with the following. The posterior vertical canal (jb) is directed backwards from its junction with the preceding to- wards the posterior surface of the temporal bone ; it is the longest of all, and has its am- pulla at the lower end. The horizontal canal (c) has separate apertures, and is the shortest of the three.

A thin fibrous periosteal membrane lines the vestibule and the semicircular canals, and is continuous with the fibrous process in the aqueduct of the vestibule. On the outer Avail of the cavity it stretches over the fenestra ovalis ; and in front it is prolonged into the cochlea through the aperture of the scala vestibuli (fig. 236, g).

This part of the osseous labyrinth has a position anterior to the vestibule, and has received its name from its resem- blance to a spiral shell. Dissection. To obtain a view of the cochlea it will be needful to cut or file away the bone between the promontory of the tympanum and the internal auditory canal on the preparation before used for displaying the vestibule; or this section may be made on another temporal bone in which the semicircular canals are not laid bare. For the like dissection in the recent state, a softened bone should be used. The cochlea (fig. 238) is conical in form, and is placed almost horizontally in front of the vestibular space.

Its length is size; about a quarter of an inch, and its width at the base is about the same. Resembling a spiral shell, the cochlea consists of a tube resembles^ wound round a central part or axis; but it differs from the shell in \n some having its tube subdivided by a partition. respects. The axis or modiolus (fig. 238, a) is the central stem which sup- °<^Jr ports the windings of the spiral tube. Conical in shape, its size ^is^ °r Fig. 238.* a.m. diminishes rapidly towards the last half turn of the tube, but it enlarges at the tip of the cochlea, forming a second small cone (b), which is bent. The axis is perforated by canals as far as the con- tracted part in the last half-turn, and the central one is larger than the others ; these transmit vessels and nerves in the fresh state. The spiral tube forms two turns and a half round the stem, and terminates above in a closed extremity named the cupola. When measivred along the outer side, it is about one inch and a half long. Its diameter at the beginning is about one-tenth of an inch, but it diminishes gradually to half that size towards the opposite end. Of the coils that the tube makes, the first is much the largest; this projects towards the tympanum, and gives rise to the eminence of the promontory on the inner wall of that cavity. The second turn is included within the first coil. The last half-turn bends sharply round, and presents a free margin (b)—the edge of the axis. In the recent bone the tube is divided into two main passages (scalEe) by the septum (fig. 238, c). In the dry bone a remnant of this partition is seen in the form of a thin osseous plate—lamina spiralis, projecting from the axis. Septum of the spiral tube (fig. 239).

The lamina spiralis is formed by two plates of bone, which en- close canals for vessels and nerves, and are separated farthest from each other at the axis. The upper surface of the lamina is covered in the outer fourth of its extent by a border or limbus of fibrous structure (a), which ends in wedge-shaped teeth near the margin of the bony plate. Between the teeth and the underlying bone is a channel (6) which is called sulcus spiralis: its edges are named vestibular (a) and tympanic (c).

Scaije OP THE cochlea (fig. 238). The tube of the cochlea is Scalasof divided by the septum into two primary passages, of which one is tear taba: the scala t ijmpani (s £), and the other scala vestibuli (s v) ; but the latter is rendered smaller by a third canal being cut off from it by membrane. These passages are placed one above another, the scala vestibuli position ; (s v) being nearest the apex of the cochlea. Above, they communi- extent; cate through the aperture named helicotrema (/). Below, they end joined differently, as the names express;—the scala vestibuli opens intoaove' the front of the vestibule (fig. 236, g) ; but the scala tympaui is Wiate shut out from the vestibular cavity by the lamina spiralis of the septum cochleae, and is closed below by the membrane of the fenestra rotunda, though in the dry bone it opens into the tympanum. Each has certain peculiarities. The vestibular scala extends into they differ the apex of the cochlea ; while the tympanic scala is largest near ana SjZe. the base. Connected with the last is the small aqueduct of the cochlea, which begins at an opening close to the lower end of the opening in scala, and ends at the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it transmits a small vein from the cochlea. The scaloe are clothed Avith a thin fibrous membrane, continuous lining with that in the vestibule : in the scala tympani it helps to close membrane' the fenestra rotunda, forming the inner layer of the secondary membrane of the tympanum, and joins the fibrous process in the aqueduct of the cochlea.

In them the ramifications of the auditory nerve are distributed. Dissection. The delicate internal sacs of the ear, with their nerves, cannot be dissected except on a temporal hone which has been softened in acid, and afterwards put in spirit. The previous in- structions for the dissection of the osseous labyrinth will guide the student to the situation of the membranous structures within it, hut the surrounding softened material must be removed with great care. The utricle (fig. 240, d), or the common sinus, is the Fig. 240.* larger of the two sacs, and is situate at the posterior and upper part of the vestibule, opposite the fovea hemiellip- tica in the roof. It is trans- versely oval in form, and con- nected Avith it posteriorly are three looped tubes, which occupy the semicircular canals. At the fore part of the sac is a thickened and more opaque part of its wall—ma- cula acustica (e), where the nerves enter; and opposite this, in the interior, is a small mass of calcareous granules or otoliths. The MEMBRANOUS SEMI- CIRCULAR canals ((/) are about one-third of the diameter of the osseous tubes, along the convex border of which they lie, being closely attached to the periosteal lining of the bony wall; and the remaining space is filled by perilymph. Each is marked at one end by an ampulla, which is relatively of large size and nearly fills the osseous case. Two are blended at one end, like the canals they occupy, so that they commiuiicate with the utricle by five openings. At each ampullary enlargement there is a transverse projection (crista acustica) into the interior of the tube; and at that spot a branch of the auditory nerve enters the wall. The saccule (fig. 240, a) is a smaller and rounder cyst than the utricle, in front of which it is placed, in the hollow of the fovea hemispherica. It communicates with the utricle through the ductus endolymphaticus, and is continous below by a short and small passage (canalis reunions; c) with the canal of the coclilea. Like the other sac, it possesses a macula (&) and otoliths where the nerves enter. * Petrous bone partly removed to show the membranous labyrinth in place (Breschet). a. Saccule; J, its macula, r.

In the vestibule the duct divides * °P™,1° into two small branches, one of which joins the saccule, and the utl.icie. other the utricle. For an account of the minute structure of the membranous labyrinth, reference must be made to a work on microscopic anatomy. Fig. 241. Auditory nerve divides into two parts ; upper lias ganglion, and supplies utricle, superior and external canals; Nerve of the Labyrinth. A special nerve, the eighth cranial or auditory (p. 189), is distributed to the labyrinth. Entering the internal auditory meatus with the facial nerve (p. 145), it divides into an upper smaller, and a lower larger piece, each of which again subdivides into three branches. At the bottom of the meatus, the upper piece is marked by a gang- lionic swelling—the intumescentia ganglioformis of Scarpa. The upper division of the nerve sends its branches to the macula of the utricle (fig. 241, c), to the ampulla of the superior vertical semicircular canal, and to the ampulla of the external semi- circular canal.

The veins are more numerous. The internal auditory artery arises from the basilar trank ■within the skull (p. 184), and divides in the internal auditory meatus into two branches,—one for the vestibule, and the other for the cochlea. The vestibular artery subdivides into small offsets which enter the cavity with the branches of the auditory nerve, and ramify over the sacs and the semicircular canals. The cochlear branch breaks up into numerous fine twigs which enter the modiolus and the canals in the lamina spiralis. Offsets supply the nerve and the parts in the neighbourhood of the limbns laminae spiralis, anil others ramify in the periosteal lining of the scalar; but there are no vessels in the outer part of the membrana basilaris. Veins. The internal auditory vein accompanies the artery, and ends in the inferior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. The vein of the aqueduct of the cochlea joins the internal jugular; and the vein of the aqueduct of the vestibule opens into the superior petrosal sinus.INDEX.

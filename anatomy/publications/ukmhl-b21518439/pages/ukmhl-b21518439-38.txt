" of the upper jaw, opposite the canine tooth, and external to the depressor of the wing of the nose. In the lower lip it is fixed on each side to the inferior jawbone, opposite the canine tooth, external to the levator menti muscle. To see these attachments the lip must be everted, and the mucous membrane carefully raised. Relations. The inner margin of the muscle is free, and bounds the aperture of the mouth ; while the outer edge blends with the different muscles Fig. 6.* that elevate or depress the lips and the angle of the mouth.

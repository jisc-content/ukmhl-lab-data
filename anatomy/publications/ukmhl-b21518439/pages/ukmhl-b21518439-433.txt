ISCHIO-RECTAL FOSSA. 419 which are contained in a sheath of fascia ; opposite the ischial tuberosity they are situate about an inch and a half from the edge of the bone, but towards the front of the space they approach to within half an inch of the margin of the ischial ramus. Crossing the centre of the hollow are the inferior hseniorrhoidal vessels and nerve (6),â€”branches of the pudic. At the anterior part, for a short and nerves distance, are two superficial perineal nerves (*) (of the pudic); and at m the S1>ace' the posterior part is a small branch of the fourth sacral nerve (?), Fig. 132.* with cutaneous offsets of the sacral plexus (4) and inferior hannor- rhoidal vessels (c), bending round the gluteus. Into this space the surgeon sinks his knife in the first incision First cut in in the lateral operation of lithotomy ; and as he carries it from enteretMs before backwards, he will divide the superficial hsemorrhoidal vessels si'acc- and nerve.

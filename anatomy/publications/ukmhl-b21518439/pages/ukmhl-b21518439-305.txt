291 BRANCHES OF ULNAR ARTERY. On the annular ligament the artery has passed through the fascia, jgW»E and lies close to the pisiform hone. The ulnar nerve, with its palmar ligament, branch, still accompanies the vessel on the inner side, Branches. The greater number of the offsets of the artery are distributed to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- Fig. 85 * Its branches are muscular, anterior and posterior recurrent, ing :— a. The anterior ulnar recurrent branch frequently arises in common with the next, and ascends on the brachialis anticus muscle, to join the branch of the anastomotic artery beneath the pronator teres. It sives offsets to the conti- guous muscles. 6. The posterior ulnar recurrent branch (d), of larger size than the ante- rior, is directed beneath the flexor sublimis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. There it passes with the ubiar nerve be- tween the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the raniifica- tions of the inferior pro- funda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow-joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve. c. The interosseous artery is a short thick trunk, which is directed back- wards towards the inter- osseous membrane, and divides into anterior and posterior branches : the two divisions will be afterwards followed. * Dissection of the deep muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two groups of muscles.

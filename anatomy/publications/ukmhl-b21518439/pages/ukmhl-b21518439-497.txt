483 VISCERAL PLEXUSES OF SYMPATHETIC. on the vessels, viz., superior mesenteric, aortic, spermatic, and in- £etictothe ferior mesenteric, are derived from the solar plexus beneath the stomach. The remaining portion of the sympathetic nerve in the abdomen will be subsequently referred to (p. 491). Dissection. On the two mesenteric arteries the dissector will have Dissection already made out the plexuses of nerves distributed to the intes- 0 tinal tube beyond the duodenum. He lias now to trace on the aorta the connecting nerves between and the mesenteric plexuses, by taking the peritoneum from the aorta l)lexus'an below the pancreas. From the upper part of the aortic plexus an offset is to be followed along the spermatic artery ; this may be done on the left side, where the vessel is partly laid bare. By detaching the peritoneum below the bifurcation of the "aorta, hypogastric and following downwards over the iliac arteries the nerves from the p exus" aortic plexus and the lumbar ganglia, the dissector will arrive at the hypogastric plexus, above the promontory of the sacrum. The superior mesenteric plexus is a large bundle of nerves, and is Superior lllf'SPllfcGTTC distributed to the same extent of the intestinal tube as the mesenteric plexus artery.

The aortic plexus is an open network of nerves covering the aorta Aortic plexus is below the superior mesenteric artery; it is stronger on the sides between than the front of the aorta, in consequence of its receiving acces- ^teriesf"0 sory branches from the lumbar ganglia, especially the left. Above, the plexus derives an offset, on each side of the aorta, from the solar and renal plexuses. It ends below, on each side, in branches offsets, which cross the common iliac artery, and enter the hypogastric plexus. From it offsets are furnished to the spermatic and inferior mesenteric arteries. The spermat ic plexus, formed by roots from both the aortic and the Spermatic renal plexus, runs on the spermatic artery to the testicle; in the cord plexus: it joins other filaments on the vas deferens. In the female, the nerves on the ovarian (spermatic) artery are in female, furnished to the ovary and the uterus. The inferior mesenteric plexus supplies the part of the intestinal Inferior tube to which its artery is distributed. This plexus is furnished from the left side of the aortic plexus ; and the nerves composing it are whiter and larger than in either of the preceding plexuses of the sympathetic. Near the sigmoid flexure the branching of the nerves join nerves and the union of contiguous twigs are well marked. Its offsets vessels" (plexuses) are left colic, sigmoid, and superior hemorrhoidal: they secondary ramify on those arteries, and have a like distribution. plexuses. The hypogastric plexus, or the large prevertebral centre for the Hypogastric supply of sympathetic nerves to the viscera of the pelvis, is situate 1>lexus: in front of the last lumbar vertebra. It is formed by the union ofsituation: the prolongations of the aortic plexus; and the nerves composing itformatio • i i 2

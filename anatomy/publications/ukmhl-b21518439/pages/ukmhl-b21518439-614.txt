coo DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. Dissection Dissection (fig. 187). Tbe inguinal glands and the superficial vessels are to be next cleaned by the removal of any surrounding fat; but the student is to be careful not to destroy a deeper, very thin layer of areolar tissue which is beneath them, and is visible on the inner side of the centre of the limb. Three sets of vessels are to see the to be dissected out :â€”One set (artery and vein) is directed inwards vessels?1111 to tlie Pu0es> m& is named external pudic ; another, superficial epigastric, ascends over Poupart's ligament; and the third, the superficial circumflex iliac, appears at the outer part of the limb. The large vein towards the inner side of the thigh, to which the branches converge, is the internal saphenous, ymplmtics, Some of the small lymphatic vessels may be traced from one inguinal gland to another. * Dissection of the superficial parts of the thigh (Illustrations of Dissec- tions). Vessels: a. Internal saphenous vein. b. Superficial pudic. c. Superficial epigastric, d. Superficial circumflex iliac, e. Inguinal glands. /. Saphenous opening. Nerves: 1. Ilio-inguinal. 2. External cutaneous. 3. Genito-crural. 4. Middle cutaneous. Small unnamed vessels accompany the different nerves to the integuments.

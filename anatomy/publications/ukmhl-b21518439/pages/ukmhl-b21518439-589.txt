STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. 575 membranous parts it is thrown into longitudinal folds during the folds; contracted state of the penis. Its surface is studded throughout with the apertures of minute glands, glands, which are lodged in the submucous tissue, and the ducts of which are inclined obliquely forwards. Submucous tissue. Beneath the mucous lining of the urethra is a Submucous stratum of longitudinal unstriated muscular fibres, mixed with tissue- elastic and fibrous tissues. It is continuous behind with the sub- mucous fibres of the bladder, and is joined in the prostate by the nature; muscular fibres accompanying the common seminal ducts. The stratum differs at spots :—It is most developed in the prostate ; arrangement in the membranous portion the muscular structure is less abundant; Fig. 179.* and in the spongy part fibrous tissue forms most of the submucous layer. Around the membranous and prostatic divisions of the urethra Erectile there is, in addition, immediately beneath the mucous membrane, a t&Xdtout thm layer of vascular or erectile tissue, which is continued back- wards from the corpus spongiosum to the neck of the bladder. Structure of the Penis. The form and the relations of the Penis penis having been described on p. 551, the bodies of which it is t^vweul r composed remain to be noticed. If a section is made along one erectile0" *' side of the penis, it will show this organ to be composed of two bodie8, masses of spongy and vascular tissue (corpora cavernosa) encased m a fibrous covering, with an imperfect septum between them, and having the corpus spongiosum attached along their under surface.

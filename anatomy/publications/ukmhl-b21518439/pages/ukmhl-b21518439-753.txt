739 NERVES OF TYMPANUM. The TYMPANIC BRANCH OP .THE GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL NERVE J^f"' (fi> 235 2 ; nerve of Jacobson, p. 108) enters a special aperture in the5 temporal bone (fig. 230, ct), to reach the inner wall of the tym- su^ies panum. In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining membrane, membrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Eustachian tube ; and it terminates in the three undermentioned ^ln°^r branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and v{Z i connect this nerve with others. Brandies. One branch is arched forwards and downwards, and one to sym- euters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (3) Pathetl('' on the artery (p. 114). The second (5) is the small deep petrosal nerve, which is directed small deep forwards through a canal beneath the cochleariform process, to join nerve, the carotid plexus of the sympathetic (sometimes also the large superficial petrosal nerve) in the foramen lacerum. And the third (■*) has the following course :—It ascends in front and small of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on the ™^r08al facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments (fig. 35). Be- yond the union with the facial, the nerve is named small superficial * Jaoobson's nerve in the tyropanum (Breschet). a. Carotid artery, b. Tensor tympani muscle, c. Inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve, d. Otic ganglion. Nerves: 1. Petrous ganglion of the glossopharyngeal. 2. Nerve of Jacohson. 3. Sympathetic on the carotid. 4. Small superficial petrosal nerve. 5. Small deep petrosal nerve. 6. Branch to Eustachian tube. 7. Facial nerve. 8. Chorda tympani. 9. Nerve of the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. 3 B 2

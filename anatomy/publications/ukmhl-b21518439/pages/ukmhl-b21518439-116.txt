DISSECTION OF DEEP VESSELS AND NERVES OF NECK. 102 Section IX. DEEP VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE NECK. Parts in this ^n tnis Section are included the deepest styloid muscle, the section. internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and some cranial and sympathetic nerves. Position of Position. The position of the part is to remain as before, viz., the head- neck is to be fixed over a small block. Dissection^ Dissection. To see the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the posterior rhaiyngeus, belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle should be de- tached from their origin and thrown down. The trunk of the external carotid artery is to be removed by cutting it through where the hypoglossal nerve crosses it, and by dividing those branches of it that have been already examined ; any veins accom- panying the arteries are to be taken away. While cleaning the pharyngeal surface of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. nerve and its branches, and the stylo-hyoid ligament are also to be prepared. The side of the jaw is to be drawn forwards on the face. Stylo- The stylo-pharyngeus muscle (fig. 23,5) resembles the other OrieS"56118' stylÂ°i<l muscles in its elongated form. The fibres arise from the root of the styloid process on the inner side, and descend between Insertion, the superior and middle constrictors to be inserted partly into the wall of the pharynx, and partly into the upper and hinder borders of the thyroid cartilage. Is between The muscle lies below the stylo-glossus, and between the carotid arteries arteries ; and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve turns over the lower end of its fleshy belly. Uge Action. It raises the pharynx, and tends to dilate the part of the cavity above the hyoid bone. From its attachment to the thyroid cartilage it will assist in elevating and drawing backwards the larynx. Stylo-hyoid The stylo-hyoid ligament is a fibrous band, which extends from ligament ^ne tip of the styloid process to the small cornu of the hyoid bone, lies by side Its position is between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus ",[Jneeei1" muscles, and over the internal carotid artery ; while the lower end is placed beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. To its posterior border, the middle constrictor muscle is attached below. It is frequently cartilaginous or osseous in part of, or occasionally hi all its extent. Sometimes a slip of fleshy fibres is continued along it. Internal The internal carotid artery supplies the deep parts of the carotid ^ad, viz., the brain, the contents of the orbit, and the nose; and takes a circuitous course through and along the base of the skull before it ends in branches to the cerebrum. Partal eady The arterial trunk in the cranium, and its offset to the orbit, have secn- ' been already learnt; but the portions in the neck and the temporal

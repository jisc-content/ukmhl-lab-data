The inner surface is smooth, and is lined by the thin dark pigmen- Fig. 224." tary layer of the retina (fig. 223). Posteriorly it is pierced by a round aperture for the passage of the optic nerve ; and anterior! y it joins the iris. The ciliary processes (fig. 225, b) are solid projections on the inner surface of the choroid coat, disposed radially, and forming a circle beneath the ciliary muscle and the outer margin of the iris. About seventy in number, they comprise larger and smaller eminences, the former being the more numerous, and having a length of about one-tenth of an inch. They increase in depth from with- out inwards ; and at their inner ends they are united by transverse ridges. By their free extremities the processes bound peripherally the space (posterior chamber; fig. 226, i) behind the iris; in front, they correspond to the ciliary muscle, and at their inner ends to the back of the iris ; while behind, they are closely applied to the membrane on the front of the vitreous body (suspensory ligament of the lens ; fig. 226, t), and fit into hollows between eminences on the anterior surface of that structure.

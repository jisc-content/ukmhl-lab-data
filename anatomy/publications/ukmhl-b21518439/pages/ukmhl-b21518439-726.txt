Kind of motion, movement of hone, state of ligaments. head of the metatarsal bone, is least impeded in the great toe joint ; hut these movements in the foot are not so free as in the hand. Articulations of the phalanges. There are two interpha- langeal joints to each toe, except the first. Ligaments similar to those in the metatarso-phalangeal joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior, are to be recognized in these articulations. The joint between the last two phalanges is least distinct; and often- times the small bones are immoveably united by osseous substance. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissection of the hand (p. 327). A simple synovial membrane exists in each phalangeal articulation. Articular surfaces. In both phalangeal joints, the nearer phalanx presents a trochlear surface ; and the distal one is marked by two lateral hollows or cups with a median ridge. Movement. Only flexion and extension are permitted in the two phalangeal joints of the toes, as in the hand. In flexion the farther phalanx glides under the nearer; and in extension the two are brought into a straight line. The bending is checked by the lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon; and the straightening is limited by the inferior ligament and the flexor tendons.

The peritoneum does not envelop the viscera in the pelvis so completely as in the upper part of the abdomen. After surround- ing the upper portion of the rectum, and forming a fold (irmo- rectum) behind it, the membrane covers the upper surface of the bladder, and projects for some way between the two viscera, thus giving rise to the recto-vesical pouch (fig. 145, 7-17)): on each Fig. 170.* The peri- toneum covers partly the rectum ; and partly the bladder leaving front and lower part free.

From the summit and sides of the bladder it is reflected to the wall of the pelvis and abdomen. All the front and lower part of the bladder are therefore uncovered by peritoneum ; and when the bladder is distended it rises above the pubic bones, so as to allow of its being opened in front without injury to the serous membrane. The recto-vesical pouch is wide above, where il corresponds with, the interval between the iliac arteries, and is narrow below between the rectum and bladder. It descends slightly into the interval between the vesiculao seminales, and ends usually at a line joining the spots where the ureters enter the wall of the Madder.

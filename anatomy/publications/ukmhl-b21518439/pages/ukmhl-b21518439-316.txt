DISSECTION OP THE HAND. 302 origin at the insertion, but these are united at the origin. Above, it arises from the lower border of the annular ligament and the Bheath of the flexor carpi radialis, from the trapezium and os magnum, and from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones. Below, its two insertion by heads are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of Fig. 88.* deeply placed in hand ; Adductor the thumb, the inner one being united with the adductor pollicis. A sesamoid bone is connected with each head close to its insertion. The tendon of the long flexor lies on this muscle, occupying- the interval between the heads near the insertion ; and the deep palmar arch of the radial artery issues beneath the inner head. Action. The muscle bends the metacarpophalangeal joint, and assists the opponens in drawing the thumb forwards and inwards over the palm. The adductor pollicis (d) is triangular in shape, with the apex * Deep dissection of the palm of tlie hand. (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles: a. Abductor pollicis. b. Opponens pollicis. c.

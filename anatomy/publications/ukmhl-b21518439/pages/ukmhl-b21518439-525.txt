511 OBVIOUS STRUCTURE OF LIVER. sheath, begin in the lobules, furnishes vaginal branches, which ramify in the sheath, giving it a red appearance in a well-injected liver, and supply twigs to the andcapsule coats of the portal vein and biliary ducts, and to the areolar tissue : from the vaginal branches a few offsets (capsular) are given to the ending in coat of the °liver. Finally, the artery ends in fine interlobular lobu es> branches, from which offsets enter the lobules. The hepatic veins (venae cavse hepaticse) begin by small intralobular ^f^ith- veins from the centre of the lobules ; these are received into the sub- 0ut a lobular branches, which anas- tomose together, and unite into Fig. 160 larger vessels. Finally, uniting with neighbouring branches to produce larger trunks, the hepatic veins are directed from before backwards to the vena cava inferior, into which they open by large orifices. The hepatic veins may be said to be without a sheath, except in the larger trunks ; so that when they are cut across the ends remain patent, in consequence of their close connection with the hver structure. Hepatic duct. The biliary ducts follow the portal vein in their mode of branching, and with the other vessels Biliary ducts form in the portal canals (fig. 160, d). right, left, run They issue from the liver at the transverse fissure in a right and ^nd left trunk, which by their union form the common hepatic duct ^pay°u {fig. 159, e).f ducts. Structure. The moderately-sized hepatic ducts consist of a fibrous structure coat, lined by a mucous layer; and penetrating the wall is a longi- s^6*™^" tudinal row of openings, on each side, leading into sacs, and into branched tubes which sometimes communicate. Lymphatics of the liver are superficial and deep. The superficial kympna- of the upper surface in part join the lymphatics of the thorax by superficial, piercing the diaphragm, and enter the anterior mediastinal glands ; those of the under surface mainly join the deep lymphatics issuing at the portal fissure. The deep lymphatics accompany both sets of vessels in the liver ; and deop. those with the portal vein descend through some small glands in the * Vessels in a portal canal, and the lobules of the liver (Kiernan).

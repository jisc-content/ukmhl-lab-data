These veins end in the internal jugular. The lingual nerve (fig. 24,1) has been followed in the pterygo- Lingual maxillary region to its passage between the ramus of the lower jaw uerve and the internal pterygoid muscle (p. 92). In the submaxillary region the nerve is inclined inwards to the side of the tongue, across along side the mucous membrane of the mouth and the origin of the superior of tonsue constrictor muscle, and above the deep part of the submaxillary Fig. 24.* gland. Lastly, it is directed forwards below the Whartonian duct, and along the side of the tongue to the apex. Branches are fur- nished to the surrounding parts, thus :— Two or more offsets connect it with the submaxillary ganglion, near the gland of that name. Farther forwards one or more branches descend on the hyo- glossus to unite in a loop with twigs of the hypoglossal nerve. Other filaments are supplied to the mucous membrane of the mouth, the gums, and the sublingual gland. Lastly, the branches for the tongue ascend through the muscular substance, and are distributed to the conical and fungiform papilkc. The submaxillary ganglion (fig. 24,2) resembles the other ganglia connected with the three trunks of the fifth nerve, and communicates with motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves.

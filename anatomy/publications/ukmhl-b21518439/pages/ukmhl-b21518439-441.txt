427 TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. ia to be removed completely from the corpus spongiosum and the surface of the ligament, and the erector muscle from the crus ot the penis Next, the crus penis is to be detached from the bone ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament nor to injure, near the pubic ramus, the terminal branches of the pudic artery and the nerve to the penis. The TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT OF THE URETHRA (deep perineal Tmngularf aponeurosis; fig. 134, c) occupies the anterior part of the sub-u?ethn.: pubic arch, and is about one inch and a half in depth in the middle line. On each side it is fixed to the pubic and ischial rami beneath the attaeh- crus penis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and in the mid- m ' die line is united with the central point of the perineum ; while laterally it is free and sloped towards the bone, so that the ligament is deeper at the sides than in the centre. Superficial to it are the bulb of the corpus spongiosum and the crura of the penis, with the ami muscles of the anterior half of the perineal space ; and the super- relatl0ns i ficial fascia joins it along the hinder border. From its deep surface some fibres of the levator ani arise ; and the thin anal fascia is con- tinued backwards from the ligament over that muscle in the ischio- rectal fossa. * Deep dissection of the perineum (Illustrations of Dissections).

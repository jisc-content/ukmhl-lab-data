MOVEMENTS OF HIP-JOINT. V V 057 Surfaces of bone. The articular surfaces of the bones are not Ai^oar completely covered with cartilage. In the head of the femur is a pit into which the round ligament femur. is inserted. The acetabulum is coated with cartilage at its circumference, ^e^^"' except opposite the cotyloid notch, and touches the head of the OU3 6Xter- 1 nally. Fig. 202.* femur by this part: this articular surface is deep above, but gradually decreases towards the edges of the notch. In the hollow of the cartilage, and close to the notch, is a mass of Pat iu the fat (fig. 186, /) covering about one-third of the area of the cotyloid bottom- cavity, which constitutes the gland of Havers : it communicates with the fat of the thigh beneath the transverse ligament. Movements. In this ball and socket joint, there are the same kinds Kinds of of movement as in the shoulder, viz., flexion and extension, abduc- tion and adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion and extension. In the swinging movement flexion is freer Swinging than extension, the thigh being capable of such elevation as to touch IU0Vemen, the belly. While swinging, the head of the femur revolves in the bottom of motion of the acetabulum, rotating around a horizontal axis ; and the rapidity femur; and extent of the movements do not endanger the security of the joint, the head of the bone not having any tendency to escape. * Hip-joint opened, to show the interarticular ligament, a.

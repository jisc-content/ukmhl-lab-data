748 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. Vessels of labyrinth. Auditory artery Iroui basilar, has a vestibular. ami a cochlear branch. Veins to petrosal sinuses and internal jugular. Blood-Vessels. The membranes of tbe labyrinth are supplied by an artery which enters the internal auditory meatus with the auditory nerve. The veins are more numerous. The internal auditory artery arises from the basilar trank ■within the skull (p. 184), and divides in the internal auditory meatus into two branches,—one for the vestibule, and the other for the cochlea. The vestibular artery subdivides into small offsets which enter the cavity with the branches of the auditory nerve, and ramify over the sacs and the semicircular canals. The cochlear branch breaks up into numerous fine twigs which enter the modiolus and the canals in the lamina spiralis. Offsets supply the nerve and the parts in the neighbourhood of the limbns laminae spiralis, anil others ramify in the periosteal lining of the scalar; but there are no vessels in the outer part of the membrana basilaris. Veins. The internal auditory vein accompanies the artery, and ends in the inferior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. The vein of the aqueduct of the cochlea joins the internal jugular; and the vein of the aqueduct of the vestibule opens into the superior petrosal sinus.

The ascending branch supplies the cajcum with the vermiform appendix and the beginning of the ascending colon, and anastomoses with the right colic artery; while the descending branch joins in a loop with the termination of the mesenteric trunk, and distributes offsets to the lower end of the ileum.

Near the ascending colon it divides into ascend- ing colon, ing and descending branches, which anastomose with the ileo-colic artery on the one side, and with the middle colic on the other. Middle colic The middle colic branch (c) springs from the upper part of the passes'to artery, and entering between the layers of the transverse meso- trausverse colon, divides into two branches : the right one anastomoses with the colon' artery to the ascending colon, and the left with the left colic branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (fig. 148, c).

Each is about an inchand a half long, and is larger at its hinder end, where it measures size; about half an inch in depth. By their narrow anterior ends the two bulbs are united in front of the urethra ; and they are joined by a venous plexus to the snail glans of the FiS- 182-* clitoris. These bodies answer to the divided bulb of the corpus spongiosum urethra in the male. connected to clitoris; represent bulb of male GENERATIVE ORGANS. The generative or- gans, or internal organs of generation, are the uterus and vagina, and the ovaries with the Fallopian tubes. Dissection. The vis- cera are now to be separated, so that the bladder and the urethra may be together, and the vagina and the uterus remain united. The bladder is to clean be set aside for subsequent use. The surface of the vagina and ,agina' the lower part of the uterus should be cleaned ; but the peritoneal investment of the latter is to be left untouched for the present.

It has a slightly curved course between the two points mentioned : and the anterior aud curved course * and posterior walls are not equal in length, for the former measures about two inches, and the latter three. In the body the vagina is flattened from before back, so that the form opposite surfaces are in contact; and the upper part of the posteiior wall is applied to the lower end of the uterus. Its size varies at and size, different spots ;â€”thus the external orifice, which is surrounded by the constrictor vagina? muscle, is the narrowest part; the middle portion is the largest; and the upper end is intermediate in dimen- sions between the other two.

COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. If7 with the internal jugular vein. Double valves, like those of the Valves, veins, are present in the interior of the tube ; and a pair guards the opening into the posterior part of the vein. Frequently the Frequenf upper part of the duct is divided ; and there may be separate van9tJr- openings into the large veins correspondmg with those divi- sions. Large lymphatic vessels from the left side of the head and neck, Brandies, and from the left upper limb, open into the upper part of the duct, and sometimes separately into the veins (10).

Fig. 28.* the left vessel arises from the arch of the aorta, and is therefore longer than the right, and contained partly in the chest. The description of the artery between its origin and the top of the sternum will be included in the dissection of the thorax. Beyond the sterno-elavicular articulation, the vessels on both In the neck sides so nearly resemble one another that the same description may serve for the two (p. 74). On the left side, however, the difference jugular vein and the pneumo-gastric nerve are nearer to the carotid "J,,™" than on the right side, and are sometimes placed over the artery, in the lower third of the neck.f Parts in the upper aperture of the thorax.

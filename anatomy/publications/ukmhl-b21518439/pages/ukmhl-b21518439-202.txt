And the most internal are continued through the tract of the other side back to the brain without entering the eye. The optic nerve extends from the commissure to the eyeball, and is about one inch and a half in length. It leaves the skull by the optic foramen, where it receives its sheaths from the dura mater and arachnoid. Its course in the orbit is described on p. 46. in the eyeball it ends in the retina. The third or oculomotor nerve (:t) is round and firm, and is Fig. 53.* attached by a series of filaments along an oblique line on the inner side of the cerebral peduncle, near the posterior perforated space, and close in front of the pons Varolii. deep in eras Beep origin.

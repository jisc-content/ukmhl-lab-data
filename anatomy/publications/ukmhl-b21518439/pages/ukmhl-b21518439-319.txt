INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 305 The interosseous muscles, so named from their position between the metacarpal bones, are seven in number. Two muscles occupy each space, except the first, where there is only one. They arise from the metacarpal bones, and are inserted into the first phalanges of the fin«ers. They are divided into palmar and dorsal ; but all are seen in the palm of the hand, though the former project more than the others. The palmar muscles (fig. 89), tbree in number, are smaller than the dorsal, and have each a single origin from the side of the Seven inter- osseous muscles, divided into palmar and dorsal. Palmar go to index, ring and little fingers. Fig. 89.* Fig. 90.+ metacarpal bone of the finger to which it belongs. The first is placed on the idnar side of the index finger, the second and third on "the radial side of the ring and little fingers respectively. The dorsal muscles (fig. 90), one in each space, arise by two heads Dorsal: two from the lateral surfaces of the metacarpal bones between which they ii(ng"1^l01n!e lie. The first (abductor indicis) is inserted on the radial side of each the index finger, the spcond on the radial, and the third on the ami ri,,j ulnar side of the middle finger, and the fourth on the ulnar side of lingers, the ring finger. Both sets of muscles have a similar termination (fig. 86, b) :— common ■ The fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted into the side of the first ^0^*3°^of or metacarpal phalanx, and sends an expansion to join the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the bone.

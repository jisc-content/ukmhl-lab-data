DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 706 Os calcis with cuboid bone, by dorsal, internal, ligaments in this The os calcis with the cuboid bone. The articulation are plantar, dorsal, and internal. The dorsal or superior calcaneo-cuboid ligament (fig. 219, r/) is a rather thin fasciculus of fibres, which is attached near to the con- tiguous ends of the os calcis and the cuboid bone; it is sometimes divided into two pieces, or it may be situate at the outer border of the foot. At the inner side of the cuboid bone is a stronger internal band (fig. 219,/) from the os calcis; this is fixed behind to the upper Fig. 220.* and inferior ligaments. The last is strongest, and divided into two parts : superficial and part of the os calcis, external to the band to the navicular bone, and in front to the contiguous inner side of the cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligament is much the strongest, and is divided into a superficial and a deep part:â€” The superficial portion, long plantar ligament (fig. 220, is attached to the under surface of the os calcis from near the posterior to the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone ; but the most internal are continued over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, assisting to form its sheath, and are inserted into the bast s of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. * Plantar ligaments of the foot (Bourgery). 1. Long plantar ligament. 2. Inner part of the short plantar ligament. 3. Tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. t View of the inferior ligaments of the tarsal bones, a. Long plantar, cut. b.

201 BASE OF CEREBRUM. the surface of the frontal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere, is the elongated process of the brain (o) named olfactory lobe, from which the °olfactory nerve-filaments spring. This process is frequently called the olfactory nerve, but its true nature as a lobe of the cerebrum is shown by its position and structure, as well as by its condition in the lower animals, in which it is generally of large size.

In the natural position the two peduncles occupy the opening in the tentorium cerebelli. Each is about three-cpiarters of an inch long, and widens as it approaches the cerebrum. Crossing its anterior surface is the optic tract; and between the crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space, * Under surface of the brain, a. Medulla oblongata, b.

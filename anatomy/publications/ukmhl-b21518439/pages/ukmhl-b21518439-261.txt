247 BOUNDARIES OF AXILLA. muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior wall are the two pectoral muscles, but these take unequal shares in its construction, in consecpience of the difference in their size :— thus the pectoralis major (a) extends over the whole front of the ^ front, space, reaching from the clavicle to the edge of the anterior fold; while the pectoralis minor (b) corresponds only to about the middle third of the wall. In the posterior boundary, from above down- and behind; wards, lie the subscapularis (f), the latissimus dorsi muscle (d), and Fig. 72.* the teres major (e): the free margin of this boundary, which is ' formed by the latissimus dorsi and teres major, is thicker and more prominent, especially near^he arm, than the anterior. On the inner side Of .the axilla lie the first five ribs, with their on the intervening iiiterco'stgl muscles, and the part of the serratus magnus er' anc (c) taking origiiiittom those bones. On the outer side the space outer sicles >' lias but small dimensions, and is limited by the humerus and the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles (g and h).

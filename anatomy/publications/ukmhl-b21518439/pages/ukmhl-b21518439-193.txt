STERNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. 179 the joint. The fibro-cartilage is of considerable strength, and prevents the clavicle being displaced upwards or inwards. Two synovial sacs are present in the articulation, one on each side Two of the fibro-cartilage. The external one is prolonged outwards for a g^3Â°vial short distance below, between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib. Movements. The clavicle can be moved upwards and downwards, Motion in and forwards and backwards ; but the extent of movement in each directions, direction is very limited, in consequence of the shortness of the liga- ments surrounding the articulation: the forward and upward movements are freer than the opposite. In the upward and down- ward movements, the clavicle glides on the interarticular fibro- cartilage ; and when the shovdder is depressed, the inner end of the bone is raised, while elevation of the shoulder is accompanied by a sinking of the inner end of the clavicle. In the forward and backward movements, the fibro-cartilage glides in the same direction over the sternal articular surface. Dislocation may take place in any direction, except downwards ; but it is of rare occurrence owing to the strength of the ligaments. x 2

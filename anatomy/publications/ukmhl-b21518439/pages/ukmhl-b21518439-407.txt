393 ACTION OF ERECTOR SPINjE. splenitis and levator anguli scapulae on the outer side, and the com- plexus on the inner side, the trachelo-mastoid being next to the •eomplexus. The cervicalis ascendens is attached to the transverse processes in a line with the splenius colli, and immediately behind the middle and posterior scalene muscles. * Action of erector spituo. These powerful muscles draw backwards J^ofboth or extend the spine, and come into play in bringing the column Fig. 121.* into, and in maintaming the erect position. The parts inserted into the dorsal vertebrae will be to some extent inspiratory muscles, since the dilatation of the thorax is aided by extension of the verte- bral column ; but the slips inserted into the ribs will draw down- wards these bones, and may thus act in forced expiration. The muscle of one side acting alone will incline the spine laterally. mu°cie anj The cervical prolongations have a similar action upon the neck and of portions , , iu neck, head. * Dissection of the muscles beneath the splenius. a.

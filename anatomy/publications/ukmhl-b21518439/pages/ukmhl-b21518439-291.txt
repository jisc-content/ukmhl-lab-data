NERVES OF THE ARM. 277 triceps muscle : one of the offsets forms an arch across the back of the humerus with a branch of the superior profunda. In front of the elbow-joint the anastomotic branch sends an offset to the pronator teres muscle ; this joins the anterior ulnar recurrent branch. The brachial veins (fig. 82, d) accompany the artery, one on vÂ«d in each side and have branches of communication across that vessel; they receive tributary veins corresponding to the branches of the artery. Superiorly they usually join into one, which enters the axillary vein near the subscapular muscle. Fig. 82.* Nerves of the Arm (fig. 82). The nerves on the front of the Nerves on arm are derived from the terminal cords of the brachial plexus. frontofarm Few of them furnish offsets above the elbow, as they are continued, for the most part without branching, to the forearm and the hand. The cutaneous branches of some of them have been already re- ferred to (p. 272). The median nerve (') arises from the brachial plexus by two Median heads, one from the outer, and the other from the inner cord thTartery, (p. 256), and accompanies the brachial artery to the forearm. Beginning on the outer side of the artery, the nerve crosses over, or less frequently under, it below the middle of the arm, and is placed on the inner side a little above the elbow. It does not give any lias not any branch in the arm ; but there may be a fascicidus connecting it branc1'- * Dissection of the inner side of the arm. (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles: a.

SCArULAR MUSCLES. 261 Section II. SCAPULAR MUSCLES, VESSELS, NERVES, AND LIGAMENTS. Dissection of muscles. Muscles attached to upper margin of the scapula, Position. After the limb has been separated from the trunk it is Position, to be placed with the subscapularis uppermost. Dissection. The, different muscles that have been traced to the scapida in the dissection of the front of the chest and of the back are now to be followed to their insertion into the bone. A small part of each, about an inch in length, should be left for the purpose of showing the attachment. Between the larger rhomboid muscle and the serratus magnus, at the base of the scapula, run the posterior scapular artery and vein, the ramifications of which are to be traced. To the borders and the angles of the scapida the following muscles are connected :â€” From the upper mar- gin of the scapida arises one muscle, the omo- hyoid (fig. 77, e). About half an inch wide at its origin, the muscle is attached to the edge of the lione behind the notch, and sometimes to the ligament which bridges over the notch. Along the axillary margin arise the long head of the triceps (fig. 83, a), and' the teres minor (h) and major (g) muscles ; these attach- ments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The vertebral border of the bone has four muscles inserted into it. and lo base > Between the superior augle and the spine is the levator anguli scapula; (fig. 78, h) ; 'opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor (j) is attached ; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major (k) is inserted : the upper fibres of the last * View of the subscapularis and the surrounding muscles.

DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 226 Aqueduct of Sylvius. Three sets of fibres in cerebral hemisphere. Ascending fibres ; The aqueduct of Syhius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum) is a narrow passage, about five-eighths of an inch long, uniting the third and fourth ventricles. It is lined by ependyma, external to which is a layer of grey matter continuous with that of the floor of the two cavities. Fibres of the cerebrum. In the cerebral hemispheres three systems of fibres are distinguished, viz., ascending, transverse, and longitudinal. The ascending are derived in large part from the spinal cord and the lower portions of the encephalon ; the transverse and longitudinal connect together parts of the cerebrum. Ascending or â– peduncular fibres (fig. 67). The longitudinal fibres entering the mid-brain from the pons are collected into two sets, Fig. 67.* which are contained respectively hi the crusta and the tegmentum. their origin. In this region they are reinforced by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and by fibres derived from the corpora quadrigemina, as well as by others springing from the grey nuclei of the crura. Fibres of Th.e fibres of the crusta enter the internal capsule ; and while some (including the pyramidal tract) are continued without interruption through this into the medullary centre of the hemisphere, others j>ass into the lenticular and caudate nuclei, and fresh fibres are mid of added from those bodies. The longitudinal fibres of the tegmentum tegmentum. for most part end in the optic thalamus, from the outer side of * Posterior view of the connections between the cerebrum, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. 1.

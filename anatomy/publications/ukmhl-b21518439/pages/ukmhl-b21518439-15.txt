B DEMONSTRATIONS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTEENAL PAKTS OF THE HEAD. Directions. In the dissection of the head and neck, the student Parts to he should endeavour to learn the parts described in the first fifty- the^ody'i's seven pages, before the position of the body is changed ; but if want turned, of time necessitates the omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 35) can be best deferred till a subsecpient stage. The exterior and the interior of the head, the orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck should be examined while the body lies in its first position on the back. The student begins with the dissection of the muscles of the scalp and ear. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Position. The body lying on the back, raise the head to a suitable Position of height, and turn the face to the right side. Extrinsic Muscles of the Ear. Three muscles pass to the Muscles of auricle from the side of the head. Two are above it,â€”one eleva- the ear' ting, the other drawing it forwards ; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards noticed (p. 34). Dissection. When the auricle has been drawn down by hooks, Dissection the position of the upper muscle will be indicated by a slight muflofesj prominence between it and the head. A horizontal incision, about three inches in length, is to be made through the skin close above the ear, and from the centre of this another cut is to'be carried up- above mentioned for a similar flaps of skin between these cuts wards along the cutaneous ridge distance. By carefully raising the from below upwards, and removing a little areolar tissue, a thin fan-shaped layer of pale muscular fibres will come into view, the

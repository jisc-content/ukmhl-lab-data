DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 376 connec tions structure ; and size are determined by the bones between which it lies. It is connected in front and behind with the anterior and posterior common ligaments ; and on the sides, in the dorsal region, with the stellate and interarticular ligaments of the ribs. In the sections that have been made the intervertebral substance Fig. 114.* Fig. 115. f outer part of fibrous lam i uk : inner part of pulpy substance,, Fig. 116.: is seen to consist of two different parts,—an external, firm and laminar, and air internal, soft and pulpy (fig. 115). The outer laminar part (fig. 116, a) forms more than half of the disc. The laminae are disposed concentrically, but do not form complete rings ; and they are at- tached by their edges to the bodies of the vertebras (fig. 1 15, «). They are composed for the most part of white fibro-cartilage ; but the superficial ones consist of fibrous tissue. The fibres are parallel in each lamina, and run obliquely between two vertebrae ; but the direction is reversed in alternate layers (fig. 114). This arrangement of the fibres is best seen on the thicker discs between the lumbar vertebras ; and it may be demonstrated by dissecting layer after layer. The central pulpy portion of the disc (fig. 116, b) is very soft, * Intervertebral substance in the lumbar region with its laniinre displayed. a.

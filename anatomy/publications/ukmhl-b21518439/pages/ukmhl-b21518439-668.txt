654 DISSECTION OP THE THIGH. thickness varies. Ilio-femoral ligament: attach- ments : trochanteric line (fig. 201) ; and above, into the neck near the great trochanter. The capsule differs much in strength, and in the arrangement vof the fibres at the fore and hinder parts. On the front it is strengthened by a broad and thick layer of longitudinal fibresâ€”the ilio-femoral ligament (fig. 200, a, c). This is fixed above, where it is about an inch broad, to the lower part of the anterior inferior iliac spine and to a rough mark continued backwards therefrom on the outer surface of the ilium immediately division ; and use. Pubo- femoral band. Thin part of capsule. above the acetabulum. Becoming wider below, it is inserted into the whole length of the anterior intertrochanteric line ; and its fibres generally form two stronger bands, which are attached at the upper and lower ends respectively of the intertrochanteric line, with a thinner part in the middle : from this arrangement the name of the Y liga- ment has also been given to it. From its position, the ilio-femoral ligament will arrest extension of the joint; and when the femur is fixed in standing it will support the pelvis. At the inner and fore part of the joint is a much smaller band (fig. 200, b), which extends from the prominent portion of the pubis internal to the acetabulum to the lower end of the anterior inter- trochanteric line, and is named the pubo-fcmoral ligament. Between the ilio-femoral and pubo-femoral ligaments, near the hip-bone, the capsule is very thin, and sometimes presents an open- * Fore part of the capsule of the hip-joint, a, c.

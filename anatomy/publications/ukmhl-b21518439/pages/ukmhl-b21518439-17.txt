3 OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS MUSCLE. thirds of the upper curved line of the occipital bone, and from the Ocetpitjl. mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The fibres are about one inch ^ 'eSdmg. and a half in length, and ascend to the aponeurosis. The anterior or frontal part (') forms a thin layer which covers Frontal about the lower two-thirds of the frontal bone. Its fibres are paler ^ at_ than those of the occipital part, and spring from the aponeurosis tacho.,1. Fig. 1:* some distance belbWthe line of the coronal suture. They descend to the eyebrow and root of the nose, where they interlace with the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, comvgator supercilii and pyramidal is nasi muscles, and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue. Some fasciculi are frequently attached to the nasal bone internally, - and to the external angular process of the frontal bone on 'the outer- side. The right and left muscular portions meet at the lower part of the forehead. ) . i.

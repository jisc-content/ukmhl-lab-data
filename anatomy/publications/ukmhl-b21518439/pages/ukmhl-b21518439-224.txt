DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 210 How to see Dissection, The parts to be now described can only be seen satisfactorily on a separate hemisphere ; but if the student possesses only the one brain, he may show much of the inner surface by cutting off the left hemisphere as low as the corpus callosum. marginal Solci. The calloso-marcjinal sulcus (cm) begins below the rostrum sulcus. of the corpus callosum, and arches upwards, following the curve of the fore part of that body. It is then directed backwards as far as Parieto- occipital iissure. Calcarine Assure. the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, Avhere it bends up- wards and ends by notching the superior margin of the hemisphere (fig. 60, cm). Its fore part is frequently interrupted by one or two small gyri uniting the adjacent convolutions. The parieto-occipital or perpendicular fissure (fig. 62, po) is a deep cleft which descends from the upper margin of the hemisphere at the back part, with a slight inclination forwards, to join the follow- ing sulcus on a level with the hinder end of the corpus callosum. The calcarine fissure (c) is nearly horizontal. It begins close to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, and is directed forwards, receiving the parieto-occipital fissure about the middle of its length, to end a little below the splenium of the corpus callosum. It gives rise to the eminence called calcar avis' in the lateral ventricle, whence its name. * Sulci and convolutions of the inner aspect of the hemisphere. Sulci: cm. Calloso-marginal. po.

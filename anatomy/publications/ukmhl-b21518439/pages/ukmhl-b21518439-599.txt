585 STRUCTURE OF OVARY. accompanies it in the inguinal canal, and remains pervious sometimes for a short distance. The ligament is composed of unstriated muscular fibres, derived from the uterus, together with vessels and areolar tissue. OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES. Ovary (fig. 183, h). The ovaries are two bodies, corresponding with the testes of the male. They are contained in the broad liga- ments of the uterus, one in each. Each ovary is of an oval form, and somewhat compressed in one direction. It is of a whitish colour, with either a smooth or a scarred surface. Its volume is variable ; but in the virgin state it is about one inch and a half in length, half as much in width, and a third of an inch in thickness. Its weight varies from one to two drachms. The ovary is placed at the back of the broad ligament, and is attached to that membrane by one margin, where the vessels enter the organ at the hilum. The other margin and both surfaces are free. One end (the upper in the natural position) is rounded, and is connected with one of the fimbriae (</) at the mouth of the Fallo- pian tube. The opposite extremity is narrowed, and is fixed to the side of the uterus by a fibrous cord,—the ligament of the ovary (t), below the level of the Fallopian tube and round ligament. Structure. The ovary consists of a stroma enclosing small sacs named Graafian vesicles, which contain the ova, and the whole is surrounded by a fibrous tunic. The peritoneum invests it except at the attached margin. The fibrous coat is continuous with the contained stroma. Some- times a yellow spot (corpus luteum), or some cicatrices, may be seen in this Fig. 184.* covering. Stroma (fig. 184). The substance of the ovary is spongy, vascular, and fibrous. At the centre the fibres radiate from the hilum towards the circumference. But at the exterior is a granular material (cortical layer) which contains very many small fol- licles, about y^gth of an inch in size —the nascent Graafian vesicles. The Graafian vesicles or ovisacs (fig. 184) are round and transparent sacs, containing fluid, and scattered through the stroma of the ovary below the cortical layer. During the child-bearing period some are larger than the rest (a); and of this larger set ten to thirty, * Ovary during the child-bearing period laid open. a.

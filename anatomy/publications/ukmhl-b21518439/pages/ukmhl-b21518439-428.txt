THE SPINAL CORD. AND ITS MEMBRANES. 414 White substance. Grey and white sub- stance vary. The white substance of (lie cord is composed chiefly of medullated nerve-fibres disposed in longitudinal bundles, which are enclosed by irregular septa of connective tissue prolonged from the pia mater on the surface. Three larger processes of the pia mater extend into the back of the cord ; these are the posterior median septum already referred to, and the posterior intermediate septum on each side, which passes forwards in the cervical region from the furrow of the same name, and separates the posterior median and postero-external columns. Modifications in the grey and white substance. The white substance Fig. 130. Fig. 131. t Crescents alter their shape. Vessels of the spinal canal.

The grey substance is least in amount in the dorsal region. The comua of the grey crescents decrease in length from above down, especially the posterior, and towards the end of the cord they blend in one indented or cruciform mass. Intraspinal Vessels. Arteries supply the cord and its mem- branes, and the bodies of the vertebrae. The veins form a remark- able plexus within the canal, but this will not be seen unless they have been specially injected. The intraspinal arteries (fig. 130, a) are derived from the vessels along the sides and front of the spinal column, viz., from the vertebral and ascending cervical in the neck, frorn the intercostal in * Intraspinal arteries in the loins (Museum of University College, London). a.

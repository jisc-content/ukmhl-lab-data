299 BRANCHES OF MEDIAN NERVE. fidal to the arteries, and reach to the last phalanx, where they end oftta in filaments for the ball, and the pulp beneath the nail. In their bourse downwards the nerves supply chiefly tegumentary branches : Jjgg. one of these is directed backwards by the side of the metacarpal phalanx, and after uniting with the digital nerve on the back of the finger (p. 285), is continued to the dorsum of the last phalanx. Fig. 87.* Dissection. The tendons of the flexor muscles may next be Dissection followed to their termination. To expose them, the ulnar artery tendons, should be cut through below the origin of the deep branch ; and the superficial volar branch of the radial having been divided, the palmar arch is to be thrown towards the fingers. The ulnar and median nerves are also to be cut below the annular ligament, and turned downwards. * Superficial dissection of the palm of the hand. (Illustrations of Dissec- tions.) Muscles: a. Abductor pollicis. c. Outer head of flexor brevis. d. Adductor pollicis. h. Palinavis hrevis. Arteries: a. Ulnar, b. Radial, c. Superficial volar branch, d. Superficial palmar arch. e. Branch uniting the arch with /, the radial digital branch of the fore finger. .'/. Digital branches of the superficial arch. Nerves.: 1. Ulnar, and 2, its two digital brandies. 3. Median, and 5, its digital branches. 4. Branch of the median to thumb-muscles. 5 (On the annular ligament). Communicating branch from the median to the ulnar.

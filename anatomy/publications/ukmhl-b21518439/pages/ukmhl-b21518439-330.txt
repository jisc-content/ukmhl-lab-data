DISSECTION OP UPrER LIMB. 316 Surface of humerus; of scapula. Kinds of movement. Flexion ami Articular surfaces (fig. 93). The convex articular head of the humerus is three or four times as large as the hollow of the scapula, and forms rather less than the half of a sphere. The head of the hone is supported on a short neck, which is joined to the shaft at an ohtuse angle. The glenoid fossa of the scapida is ovoidal in form with the larger end down, and is very shallow. Its margin is slightly more promi- nent "below than ahove. Movements. In this joint there is the common angular motion in four directions, with the circular or circumductory; and in addition a movement of rotation. In the swinging to and fro movement, the carrying forwards and Fig. 93.* extension are accom- panied by rotation of scapula. Condition of head of humerus. Checks to movements. inwards of the humerus constitutes flexion; and the moving it backwards and outwards, extension. Flexion is freer than extension; and as the joint is bent the scapula follows the humerus, undergoing a rotation upwards, so that the whole range of movement of the aim in this direction is much greater than that taking place in the scapulo-humeral articulation. In extension the scapula is similarly rotated downwards, the lower angle approaching the spine. During these movements the head of the humerus rests in the bottom of the glenoid fossa, rotating around an axis that is nearly perpendicular to the plane of that cavity ; and there is no tendency to dislocation either from the rapidity or extent of the movement. Flexion of the humerus upon the scapula is checked by the twisting of the capsule, and by the meeting of the small tuberosity of the former bone with the coraco-acromial arch. Extension is limited mainly by the coraco-humeral ligament. Abduction and adduction. In abduction,, the arm is moved out- * "View of the interior of the shoulder-joint, a.

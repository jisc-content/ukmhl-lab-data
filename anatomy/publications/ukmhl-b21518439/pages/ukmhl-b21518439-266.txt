DISSECTION OF THE UTTER LIMB. 252 and nerves On the acromial side lie the cords of the brachial plexus; superficial to it is the external anterior thoracic nerve; and' beneath it is the posterior thoracic. StfSd- In itS secondVart, the pectoralis minor and major (b and a) are with ' sulierficial t0 the a^eiy. But there is not any muscle immediately muscles, m contact behind, for the vessel is placed across the top of the axilla, particularly when the limb is in the position recpiired by the dissection. ve!a> The companion vein (g) lies to the inner side, but separated from the arterial trunk by the inner cord of the brachial plexus. and nerves In this position the cords of the brachial plexus lie around it, one being outside, another inside, and the third behind the artery. And beyond Beyond the pectoralis minor, the artery is at first concealed by pectoral1: t^ie lÂ°wer border of the great pectoral muscle (a) ; but thence to * Second view of the dissection of the chest (Illustrations of Dissections).

380 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Rotation : movement of bones : where present. vertebral substance compressed ; and on the left those structures will be tightened so as to check the movement. Rotation is the twisting of the bodies of the vertebra) around a vertical axis through their centres, the fore part being turned to the right or left, while the lower articular processes glide in the opposite direction over the upper of the next bone below. The movement will obviously be checked by the tightening of one set of oblique fibres in the intervertebral disc. A pure rotation of this kind, however, takes place only to a small extent in the upper dorsal region ; but in the neck a greatei degree of turning movement is permitted in combination with lateral flexion, owing to the conformation of the articular surfaces. In the loins the articular surfaces are so disposed that rotation is impossible.

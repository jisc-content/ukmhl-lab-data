Externally it is fixed to the conjoined rami of the ischium and pubis, outside the line of the crus penis and its muscle, extending as far back as the ischial tuberosity. Posteriorly this layer bends upwards to join the triangular ligament of the urethra; but in front it is unattached, and is continued to the scrotum and penis.

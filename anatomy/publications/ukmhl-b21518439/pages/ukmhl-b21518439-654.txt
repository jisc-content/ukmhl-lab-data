DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 640 Inferior gluteal to gluteus maxiinus. largest are furnished to parts beyond the gluteal region, hut some are distributed to the muscles at the back of the pelvis. The inferior gluteal NERVE is larger than the superior, and arises from the upper part of the sacral plexus (fig. 196, ig). The short trunk is directed backwards below the pyriformis, and divides Fig. 196.* branches which radiate upwards and downwards, gluteus maximus midway between its origin and into numerous and enter the insertion. The small sciatic (fig. 195/) is a cutaneous nerve of the back It sidings from the second and third sacral nerves (fig. 196, ss), and takes the course of the sciatic artery as far as the lower border of the great gluteus, where it gives many cutaneous branches. Much diminished in size at that sjiot, the nerve is con- tinued along the back of the thigh beneath the fascia, and ends SUESSf of the thigh. * Diagram of the sacral plexus from behind. L S C.

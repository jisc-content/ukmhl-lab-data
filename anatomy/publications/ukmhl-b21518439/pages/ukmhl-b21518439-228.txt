DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 214 from"'others ^ juy"'s of tlie sePtluu lucidvmi, and lias not any lining of ventride. Tlie lateral ventricle (fig. 63) is a narrow space which extends nearly the whole length of the hemisphere, and sends a process downwards into the temporo-sphenoidal lohe. The cavities of the two sides approach one another in front, where they are only separated Kg. 63.* by the thin septum lucidum ; and below the hinder part of that partition, each communicates with the third ventricle by an aperture known as the foramen of Monro. At the back there is a wider interval between them. The roof of the space is formed in it? whole extent by the fibres of the corpus callosum passing outwards to the convolutions; in the floor are numerous objects which will be enumerated in connection with the several parts of the ventricle. Subdivision. The ventricle consists of a central part or body, and three processes or comua, anterior, posterior, and middle or inferior. * View of the lateral ventricles : on the left side the descending cornu is laid open.

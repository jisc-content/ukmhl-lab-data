535 LUMBAR PLEXUS. the Four lumbar nerves enter plexus Fig. 167.1 and supply muscles: liftli to the sacral plexus. On the right side the psoas is to be left untouched, in order that the place of emergence from it of the different offsets of the plexus may be noticed. Lumbar Spinal Nerves. The anterior primary branches of lumbar nerves enter the lumbar plexus, with the exception of the last. Five in number, they increase in size from above down, and are joined by filaments of the sympathetic near the intervertebral fora- mina. Before entering the plexus, they supply branches to the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The fifth nerve (fig. 173) receives a commu- nicating branch from the fourth, and is to be fol- lowed into the pelvis to its junction with the sacral plexus. After the two are united, the name lumbosacral cord is ap- plied to the common trunk. The LUMBAR PLEXUS (fig. 167) is formed by the intercommunication of the first four lumbar nerves. Contained in the substance of the psoas, near the posterior surface, it consists of communicating loops be- tween the several nerves, and increases in size from above downwards, like the individual nerves. Superiorly it is sometimes muted by a small branch with the last dorsal nerve ; and infenorly it joins the sacral plexus through the large lumbo- sacral cord. The branches of the plexus are six in number, and supply the Six lower part of the abdominal wall and the muscular covering of the '5?'_°s' Plexus bow formed; situation ; connections witll nerves.

580 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. dissection to see it; is like the penis; has a glans and 11 e- puee; comi osi- tion, anterior commissure must be removed ; and, after the body of the organ has been laid bare, the crura, one on each side, are to be followed outwards. The clitoris (fig. 181, b) is a small erectile body, and is the repre- sentative of the penis. It has the same composition as the penis, except that the urethra is not continued along it. Its an tenor extremity is terminated by a rounded part or glans (c), and is covered by a fold of the mucous membrane corresponding to the prepuce of the male (p. 432). In its structure this organ resembles the penis in the following particulars:â€”It consists of corpora cavernosa, which are attached Fig. 181.* corpora cavernosa, CO) pus spongio- sum, and erectile tissue. Bulbs of vestibule: by crura (one on each side ; a) to the ischio-pubic rami, and are blended in the body. A small suspensory ligament descends to it from the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris; and along the middle is an imperfect pectiniform septum. Farther, it possesses a portion of corpus spongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans clitoridis (c). Structure. The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that in the male organ (p. 576). The blood-vessels of the corpus cavernosum are like those of the penis; and the glans receives the ending of the dorsal artery (p. 440). The bulb OF the vestibdle (semi-bulb, Taylor; fig. 182, a) is an elongated and flattened mass of cavernous or erectile tissue, which is enclosed in a thin fibrous coat. It lies by the side of the vestibule * Representation of the clitoris. a. Cms, and b. Body of the corpus cavernosum c. Gl.ina clitoridis.

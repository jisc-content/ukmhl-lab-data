DISSECTION OF TIIK ABDOMEN. 48S in which it gastric branches. It then ascends between the layers of the small enas' omentum, on the left side of the bile-duct and portal vein, and divides near the transverse fissure of the liver into two—the right and supplies and left hepatic. Branches are distributed not only to the liver, but also to the stomach, the duodenum, and the pancreas, as below :— onsets to a- The gastro-chwdenal artery is a short vessel which descends beneath the duodenum near the pylorus, and divides into the two following branches :— stomach, The r^lt gastroepiploic artery (h) is the continuation of the gastro-duodenal trunk, and runs from right to left along the great curvature of the stomach. It gives offsets upwards to the surface of the stomach, and downwards to the great omentum, and ends by inosculating with the left gastro-epiploVc artery.' duodenum The superior pancreaticv-duodenal artery (i) is of small size, and pancreas descends between the duodenum and pancreas to join the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. Offsets are given to both the viscera ; and on their posterior aspect is another small artery of the pancreatico-duodenal, with a similar position and distribution. b. The pyloric branch (o) descends to the small curvature of the stomach, and, running from right to left, anastomoses with the coronary artery; it distributes small twigs on both surfaces of the stomach. Branches to The hepatic branches sink into the liver at the transverse fissure, the liver, an(j ramjfv in its substance :— * View of the coeliac axis, and of the viscera to which its branches are supplied (Tiedernann).

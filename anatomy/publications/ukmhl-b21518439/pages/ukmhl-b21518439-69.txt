CLAVICULAR PAET OF POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. clavicle He the suprascapular vessels ; and crossing the upper angle, at'the meeting of the onio-hyoid and sterno-mastoid muscles, are the transverse" cervical vessels. Entering the space from above is the external jugular vein (8), which descends over (seldom under) the omo-hyoid, and opens into the subclavian vein; in this region Fig. 14.* the vein receives the suprascapular and transverse cervical branches, and sometimes a small vein over the clavicle, from the cephalic vein of the arm. * Part of the posterior triangle of the neck is here displayed, but the student should carry the dissection as high as the head, so as to lay bare the whole of that space. 1.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 438 posterior The posterior branches are small, and are directed back to the integuments over the latissimus dorsi muscle, tamohs 6 anterior branches are continued forwards nearly to the edge of the rectus muscle, and increasing in size from above down, supply the integuments on the side of the belly : they furnish offsets to the digitations of the external oblique muscle. Last dorsal The lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve is larger than, and does not divide like the others. After piercing the fibres of the external oblique muscle, it is directed over the iliac crest to the .sur- face of the gluteal region (p. 631). Anterior The antertor cutaneods nerves of the abdomen pierce the nerves of* saeath of the rectus : in the integuments they bend outwards to- intercostal, wards the lateral cutaneous nerves. The number and the situation of these small nerves are very uncertain, iiio-hypo- The ilio- hypogastric nerve is distributed by two pieces : one hmibar° passes over the crest of the ilium (iliac branch); the other ramifies plexus: on the lower part of the abdomen (hypogastric branch) :— iliac branch, (a) The iliac branch lies close to the crest of the hip-bone near the last dorsal nerve, and enters the fat of the gluteal region (p. 632). hypogastric (b) The hypogastric branch pierces the aponeurosis of the exter- biuiich. na| 0UiqUe muscle above the abdominal ring, and is distributed to the skin of the lower part of the abdomen, mo-inguinal The ilio-inguinal nerve becomes cutaneous through the exter- J'i('xus°f th° nal abdominal ring, and descends to the teguments of the scrotum, and upper and inner part of the thigh. Vessels with Cutaneous Vessels. Cutaneous vessels run with both sets of nerves on the abdomen ;—with the lateral cutaneous nerves are branches from the intercostal arteries; and with the anterior cutaneous are offsets from the internal mammary and epigastric vessels. In the groin are three small superficial branches of the femoral artery, viz., pudic, epigastric, and circumflex iliac. both lateral The lateral cutaneous arteries have the same distribution as the nerves they accompany. The anterior or chief offsets are directed towards the front of the abdomen, and end about the outer edge of the rectus muscle, and anterior The anterior cutaneous arteries are irregular in number cutaueous. ancl in position, like the nerves. After piercing the sheath of the rectus, they run outwards with the nerves towards the other set of branches. Prom Branches of the femoral artery. Three cutaneous onsets arte0rath ascend from the thigh between the layers of the superficial fascia, brandies';6 and ramify in the integuments of the genital organs and lower part of the abdomen. The beginning of these vessels appears in the dis- section of the thigh, external The external pudic branch (superficial) crosses the spermatic pudic, cora^ to which it gives offsets, and ends in the integuments of the under part of the penis. . superficial The superficial epigastric branch ascends over Poupart's ligament, epigastric

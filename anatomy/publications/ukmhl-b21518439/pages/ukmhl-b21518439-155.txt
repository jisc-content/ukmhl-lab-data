HI SPHENOPALATINE GANGLION. the mouth through the largest palatine canal, and courses forwards £0as2™chos nearly to the incisor teeth, where it joins the naso-palatine nerve. While in the canal, the nerve furnishes two or more filaments (inferior nasalj) to the membrane on the middle and lower spongy- bones ; in the roof of the mouth it supplies the mucous membrane and glands, and gives an offset to the soft palate. The small or posterior palatine nerve (10) lies in the smaller canal, small; and and ends inferiorly in the soft palate, the uvula, and the tonsil. It is said to supply the levator palati and azygos uvulae muscles. The external palatine nerve is smaller than the other two, and external descends in the canal of the same name to be distributed to the pa a me- velum palati and the tonsil. The pharyngeal branch is very small, and is directed through the pharyngeal Fig. 34.* pterygopalatine canal to supply the mucous membrane of the pharynx near the Eustachian tube. Branches to the orbit. Two or three in number, these ascend Orbital through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and end in the periosteum and orbital muscle (p. 50). It will be necessary to cut through the sphenoid bone to follow these nerves to their termination. Connecting branches. The ganglion is united, as before said, with Uniting the spheno-palatine branches of the fifth nerve (fig. 34,'), receiving braucnes' sensory fibres through them; and through the medium of the ' Vidian, which is described below, it communicates with a motor nerve (facial), and with the sympathetic nerve. * Nerves of the outer wall of the nose and of the palate. 1.

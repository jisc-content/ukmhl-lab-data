196 DISSECTION OP THE BRAIN. vanes m extent. fibres from each, side, but the proportion of the pyramidal fibres which decussate in the medulla varies much in different individuals. Dissection. For the purpose of seeing the deeper fibres of the medulla oblongata, the pyramid may be cut across on the right side between the decussation and the olivary body (fig. 57) and raised towards the pons. The lateral tract is composed of the remaining fibres of the lateral ra " column of the cord, after the crossed pyramidal tract has been given off. Most of these pass deeply behind the olivary body, and through the reticular formation to the pons ; but one .small band, the direct cerebellar tract, is continued superficially from the lateral column to the cerebellum. This band is often visible on the surface of the medulla, as a whiter streak lying along the outer edge of the Dissection. Fibres of Direct cerebellar tract. Fibres of funiculus cuneatus, gracilis, and of Rolando. Formation of restiform body. Arciforin fibres, lateral tract, and inclining backwards above the tubercle of Rolando to join the restiform body. Posterior funiculi. The white fibres of the cuneate and slender funiculi are the continuation of the posterior, and posterior median columns of the cord respectively, and are believed to end entirely in the grey nuclei of the funiculi. The funiculus of Rolando has only a very thin superficial white layer, which is also derived from the posterior column. The restiform body is formed mainly by the arciforin fibres of the medulla, with the direct cerebellar tract from the lateral column of the cord. Arciform fibres.

Costo-cora- At this stage the cephalic vein is to he defined as it crosses in- wards to the axillary vein. A branch of nerve (anterior thoracic), and the acromio-thoracic vessels, which perforate the sheath around the axillary trunks, are to be followed to the pectoral muscle. The remaining part of the pectoralis major may be cut about its centre, and the pieces thrown inwards and outwards. Any fat coming into view is to be removed ; and the tendon of the pectoralis is to be followed to the humerus. Insertion of the pectoralis. The tendon of the pectoralis consists of two layers, anterior and posterior, at its attachment to the bone ;â€” the anterior receives the clavicular and upper sternal fibres, and joins the tendon of the deltoid muscle ; and the posterior gives attachment to the lower ascending fibres. The tendon is from two inches to two inches and a half wide, and sends upwards one ex- pansion over the bicipital groove to the capside of the shoulder- joint, and another downwards to the fascia of the arm. Parts covered by the pectoralis. The great pectoral muscle covers the pectoralis minor, and forms alone, above and below that muscle, the anterior boundary of the axilla. Between the pectoralis minor and the clavicle it conceals the subclavius muscle, the sheath con- taining the axillary vessels, and the branches perforating that sheath. Below the pectoralis minor it lies on the side of the chest, on the axillary vessels and nerves, and on the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles near the humerus. The pectoralis minor (fig. 73, b) is also triangular in shape, and extends from the thorax to the shoulder. It arises from the third, fourth and fifth ribs, immediately external to their cartilages, by tendinous slips which are blended with the aponeuroses covering the intercostal muscles. The fibres converge to their insertion into the anterior half of the coracoid process of the scapula, at its upper and inner part. This muscle assists the pectoralis major in forming the anterior wall of the axilla, and near its insertion it lies over the large vessels and the accompanying nerves. The upper border is separated from the clavicle by a triangular interval. The lower border projects beyond the pectoralis major close to the chest; and along it the long thoracic vessels lie. The tendon of insertion is united with the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps. Action. It draws the scapula forwards and downwards ; and in laborious breathing it becomes an inspiratory muscle, taking its fixed point at the shoulder. Dissection. Supposing the clavicle raised by pressing backwards the arm, as before directed, the tube of fascia around the vessels will be demonstrated by making a transverse cut below the costo- coracoid membrane (fig. 73), so that the handle of the scalpel can be passed beneath it. Then, by dividing the membrane itself near the clavicle and raising the lower border of the subclavhis, this muscle will be seen to be encased by fascia, which is attached to the bone both before and behind it. The costo-coracoid membrane or ligament (fig. 73) is a firm

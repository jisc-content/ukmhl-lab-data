Be- hind the crest of bone, near the common opening of two of the semicircular canals, is the aperture of the aqueduct of the vestibule (c), a narrow canal which ends on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it contains a process of the membra- nous labyrinth called the ductus endolymphaticus, and a small vein. Fig. 236.* The roof is occupied by a slight transversely oval depression, fossa in roof. fovea hemielliptica; this is separated from the fovea hemispherica by a prolongation of the crest (b) on the inner wall. The semicircular canals (fig. 237) are three osseous tubes, Three semi- circulcir which are situate behind the vestibule, and are named from their canals: form. Dissection. These small canals will be easily brought into view preparation 1 ly the removal of the surrounding bone by means of a file or bone 0 tlie,n' forceps. Two may be seen opening near the aperture made in the vestibule, and may be followed thence ; but the third is altogether towards the posterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canals are unequal in length, and each forms more than half length; an ellipse. They communicate at eacli end with the vestibule, but termination the contiguous ends of two are blended together so as to give only live openings into that cavity. Eacli is marked by one dilated one end extremity which is called the ampulla.

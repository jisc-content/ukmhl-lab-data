265 INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE. The infraspinatus mdscle (fig. 78, b) occupies the infraspinous Infraspina- fossa of the scapula, and extends to the upper end of the humerus. f™™8C8 The muscle arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula, ^ Qf ^ from the dorsal surface of the bone below that process, except at the name; neck and the narrow area along the axillary border where the teres muscles are attached, and from a special fascia covering it. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the middle insertion: impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and joins the Eig. 78. ♦ tendons of the supraspinatus and teres minor. The fleshy fibres arising from the spine overlay the tendon of the muscle. A part of the muscle is subcutaneous ; but the upper portion is relations concealed by the deltoid, and the lower angle by the latissinius dorsi. The lower border is- in contact with the teres minor, with which it is often united. The muscle lies on the scapula and the scapulo-humeral articulation ; and there is sometimes a small bursa between it and the capsule of the joint. Action. With the humerus hanging it acts as a rotator outwards ; arid "s° and when the bone is raised it will move the arm backwards in concert with the hinder part of the deltoid. * View of the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and of the circumflex vessels and nerve.

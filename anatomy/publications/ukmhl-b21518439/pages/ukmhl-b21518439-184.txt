DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 170 anticus major. Origin. Insertion. the preceding muscle, and is largest at the upper end. Its origin is by pointed tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the trans- verse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebra); and the fibres ascend to be inserted, shortly tendinous, into the basilar process of the occipital bone by the side of the pharyngeal tubercle, reaching from the middle line to the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Fig. 45. Relations. Use. Rectus anticus minor is beneath preceding. This muscle partly conceals the longus colli and rectus anticus minor. Its anterior surface is in contact with the pharynx, the internal and common carotid arteries, and the sympathetic nerve. The origin from the cervical vertebrae corresponds with that of the scalenus anticus. Action. It flexes the head and the cervical portion of the spine. The rectus capitis anticus minor (fig. 45, o) is a small flat- muscle, which arises from the front of the lateral mass of the atlas at the root of the transverse process, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone behind the last muscle, and half an inch from its fellow. The anterior primary branch of the suboccipital nerve emerges between the borders of this muscle and the rectus capitis lateralis. * Deep muscles of the front of the neck and scaleni. a. Longus colli. b. Rectus capitis anticus major, o. Scalenus anticus. D. Scalenus medius. f. Scalenus posticus, o. Rectus capitis anticus minor.

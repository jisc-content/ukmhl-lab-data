The anterior annular ligament of the wrist, which arches over the tendons passing to the hand, is next to be defined. This strong band is at some depth from the surface; and while the student removes the fibrous tissue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the palm of the hand. The ulnar vessels and nerve pass over the ligament, and will serve as a guide to its depth. Hollow in front of the elbow (fig. 84). This hollow is situate between the inner and the outer muscles of the forearm, and is some- what triangular in shape, with the wider jjart towards the humerus. It is bounded on the outer side by the supinator longus muscle, and on the inner side by the pronator teres. The aponeurosis of the limb is stretched over the space ; and the bones, covered by the brachialis anticus and supinator brevis, form the deep boundary. Contents. In the hollow are lodged the termination of the brachial artery, with its veins, and the median nerve ; the musculo-spiral nerve ; the tendon of the biceps muscle ; and small recurrent vessels, with much fat and a few glands. These several parts have the following relative position :—The tendon of the biceps is directed towards the outer boundary to reach the radius ; and on the outer side, concealed by the supinator longus muscle, is the musculo-spiral nerve. Nearly in the centre of the space are the brachial vessels and the median nerve, the nerve being internal; but as the artery is inclined to the outer side of the limb, they soon become distant from one another about half an inch. The brachial artery divides here into two trunks—radial and ulnar ; and the recurrent radial and ulnar branches appear in the space— the former on the outer, and the latter on the inner side. Two or three lymphatic glands lie on the sides of the artery, and one below its point of splitting. Muscles on the Front of the Forearm (fig. 84). The muscles on the front of the forearm are divided into a superficial and a deep group. In the superficial group there are five muscles, which are fixed to the inner condyle of the humerus by a common tendon, and lie in the undermentioned order from the outer to the inner side ;— pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris ; and deeper and larger than any of these is the flexor sublimis digitorum. The deep group will be met with in a subsequent dissection (p. 293). The pronator radii teres (fig. 84,3) arises from the inner con- dyle of the humerus by the common tendon ; from the ridge above the condyle by fleshy fibres ; from the inner edge of the coronoid process by a second tendinous slip ; and from the fascia, and the septum between it and the next muscle. It is inserted by a flat tendon into an impression, an inch in length, on the middle of the outer surface of the radius.

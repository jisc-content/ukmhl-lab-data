730 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. anterior ; the greater portion of the margin is rough, and gives at- inner end. tachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is smaller, and is marked in the dry hone, except at the upper part where there is a notch in the osseous margin, hy a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall and the floor extend inwards beyond the hinder wall and the roof for nearly a quarter of an inch. Condition in In the fcetus the osseous part of the meatus is very imperfect, the the fcetus. floor an& anterior wall being composed of fibrous tissue (Symington). After birth the osseous wall is completed by an outgrowth from the ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. Fig. 230.* Lining Lining of the meatus. A prolongation of the integument lines oTtheskin. the auditory passage, and is united more closely to the osseous than to the cartilaginous portion ; it is continued over the membrane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pellicle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue over the cartilage Ceruininons of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow-brown colour, glands. resembling in form and arrangement the sweat-glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear-wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices ; they are absent in the osseous part, and are most abundant in that 'small portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. Vessels. Vessels and nerves. The meatus receives its arteries from the pos- terior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the temporal branch of Nerves. the external carotid (p. 80).

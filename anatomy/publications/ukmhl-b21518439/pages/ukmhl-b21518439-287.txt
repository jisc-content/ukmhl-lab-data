273 FASCIA AND MUSCLES OF THE ARM. the inner side and posterior surfade of the arm in the upper half. The size and distribution of this nerve depend upon the develop- ment of the small internal cutaneous and the offset of the musculo- spinal The deep fascia of the arm is a white shining membrane, which Aponeurosis surrounds the limb, and sends processes between the muscles. oft eann Over the biceps muscle it is thinner than elsewhere. At certain points it receives accessory fibres from the subjacent tendons :—thus, receives ac- in front of the elbow an offset from the tendon of the biceps joins it; ^jons and near the axilla the tendons of the pectoralis major, latissimus tendons; dorsi, and teres major send prolongations to it. At the upper part of the limb the fascia is continuous with that ^^°sition of the axilla, and is prolonged over the deltoid and pectoral muscles to the scapula, clavicle, and chest.

As the back of the arm will not be dissected now, the Directions skin may be replaced on it until the front has been examined. g°rvgdot>" And to keep in place the vessels and nerves at the upper part of the limb, these should be tied together with string in their natural position to one another, and fastened to the coracoid process.

The limb is still to lie on the back, but the shoidder is Position of to be raised by means of a small block; and the scapula is to be fixed in such a position as to render tense the muscles. The inner surface of the arm is to be placed towards the dissector. Dissection. The aponeurosis is to be reflected from the front of Dissection the arm by an incision along the centre, like that through the skin; ' and it is to be removed on the outer side as far as the outer supra- condylar ridge of the humerus, but on the inner side rather farther back than the corresponding line, so as to lay bare part of the of vessels, triceps muscle. In raising the fascia the knife must be carried in the direction of the fibres of the biceps muscle ; and to prevent the displacement of the brachial artery and its companion nerves, fasten them here and there with stitches. In front of the elbow is a hollow containing the brachial vessels ; and of hol- and into this the artery should be followed, to show its ending in the elbow, radial and ulnar trunks. Muscles on the Front of the Arm. There are only three Position of muscles on the front of the arm. The one along the centre of the of ti™ Tnn* limb is the biceps ; and that along its inner side, reaching about half way down, is the coraco-brachialis. The brachialis anticus lies beneath the biceps. Some muscles of the forearm are connected to the inner and outer condyles of the humerus, and to the ridge above the outer condyle. The biceps muscle (fig. 81,8; 82, b) forms the prominence seen Biceps has on the front of the arm. It is wider at the middle than at either taJSS? end; and the upper end consists of two tendinous pieces of dif- ferent lengths, which are attached to the scapula.

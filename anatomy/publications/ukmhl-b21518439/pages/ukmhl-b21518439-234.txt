Fig. 65.* Crossing the centre of the ventricle, from one optic thalamus to the other, is a band of grey matter—the soft commissure (d). Openings This space communicates with the other ventricles of the brain into other in the following way :—In front it joins each lateral ventricle ventricles. o j j * View of the third and fourth ventricles ; the former being exposed by the removal of the velum interpositum ; and the latter by dividing vertically the worm of the cerebellum.

The posterior surface, rounded, is invested altogether by the serous membrane. extremities, The upper end or fundus is the largest part of the organ, and is in Pig. 171.* contact with the small intestine. The lower end or neck (cervix) is received into the vagina. To each side are attached the broad ligament with the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, and the ovary. The round or suspensory ligament (n) is a fibrous cord about five inches long/ which is directed forwards and outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and then through the inguinal canal to end in the groin. This cord lies over the obliterated hypogastric, and the ex- ternal iliac artery ; and it is surrounded by the peritoneum, which accompanies it a short way into the canal. The Fallopian tube (m), about four inches long, is contained in * Side view of the female pelvis. (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles and Viscera: A. Pyriformis muscle, cut. b.

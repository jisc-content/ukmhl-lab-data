183 YERTEBEAL AND BASILAR ARTERIES. d. The inferior cerebellar artery (posterior, ,0) arises from the end JJ^* nndB of the vertehral (sometimes from the basilar), and winds backwards cerebellum, round the medulla oblongata, between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, to the median groove of the cerebellum. Directed onwards in the sulcus between the hemisphere and the inferior vermiform process, the artery reaches the hinder margin of the small brain, and there anastomoses with the superior cere- bellar artery. An offset of this branch ramifies over the under part of the offsets, cerebellar hemisphere, and ends externally by anastomosing with the Fig. 52.* artery of the upper surface. As the vessel passes by the side of the fourth ventricle, it gives a small choroid branch to the plexus of that cavity. The basilar artery (u), formed by the union of the two verte- Basilar brals, reaches from the lower to the upper border of the pons, where artery> it ends by dividing into two branches (posterior cerebral) for the extent antl cerebrum. The vessel lies in the median groove of the pons, rest- situation, ing against the body of the sphenoid bone. On each side of, and almost parallel to it is the sixth nerve. Brandies. Besides the two terminal branches mentioned above, Branches: the artery supplies transverse offsets to the pons and the fore part of the cerebellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of the cerebellum. a. The transverse arteries of the pons are four or five small twigs, transverse to the lions; * Arteries at the base of the brain. 1. Internal carotid trunk. 2. Anterior cerebral. 3.

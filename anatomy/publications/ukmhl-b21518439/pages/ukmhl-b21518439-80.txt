DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 66 of brachial plexus; The outer part of the subclavian artery having been already prepared, let the dissector remove more completely the fibrous tissue from the nerves of the brachial plexus. From the plexus trace the small branch to the subclavius muscle, and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles, which pierce the middle scalenus. Fig. 16.* of cervicul plexus. If it is thought necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied. Clean the cervical plexus, and seek its muscular branches, the small twigs to join the descendens noni, and the roots of the phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the middle scalenus muscle be defined, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. * A view of the common carotid and subclavian arteries(Quain's" Arteries"). 1.

308 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. The Substance called Gland of the Joints covered with a Vascular Membrane, and lodged in a Depression in the under and inner part of the Acetabulum. At the edges of this Substance F/vV/ges are sent out, which furnish part of the Synovia for the lubrication of the Joint. The edges of this Substance are fixed to those of the Pit in the Acetabulum, by small Ligamentous Bridles, termed Ligamenta Miicosuy vel Ligamcniula Masses Adir ]wso~ G landulosee. Ligaments, &c. of the Joint of the Knee. Tlie Lateral Ligaments which lie at the sides of the Joint, and adhere to the outer Surface of the Capsular Ligament. The Internal Lateral Ligament y which is of consider- able breadth, arising lrom the upper part and Tubercle of the internal Condyle of the Os Femoris, and inserted into the upper and inner jiart of the Tibia ; the Fibres passing obliqu^y forwards, till they have reached a iitik below the Plead of the Bone. The Long External Lateral Ligamenty which is nar- rower, but thicker and stronger than the former, aris- ing from the Tubercle above the external Condyle of the Os Femoris, and fixed to the Fibula, a little below its Head. â€¢ Behind the long external Lateral Ligament, there is an Expansion attached nearly in the same manner as this Ligament, which has been termed the External Short Lateral Ligament.' These Ligaments prevent the lateral and rotatory mo- tions

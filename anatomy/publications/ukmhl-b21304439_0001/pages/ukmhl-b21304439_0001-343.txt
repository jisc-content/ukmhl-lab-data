The two Transverse Ligaments of the Pelvis., which arise from the posterior part of the Spine of the Os Ilium, and run transversely. The one is superior, and is fixed to the Transverse Process of the last Vertebra of tlie Loins; the other inferior, and is connected to the first Transverse Process of the Os Sacrum. The Ilio-Sacral Ligaments, which arise from the pos- terior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium, descend oblique- ly, and are fixed to the first, third, and fourth spurious Transverse Processes of the Os Sacrum. ' These, .with the two Transverse Ligaments, assist in j binding the Bones together to which they are connected. The Capsular Ligament of the Symphysis of the Os I Ilium and Saaiim, which surrounds the Joint, and as- j sists in connecting the two Bones to each other. A very thin Cartilage within this Joint, which cements l| the two Bones strongly together, and which constantly •! ailheres to the Os Sacrum, when the Joint is opened. T2 a k

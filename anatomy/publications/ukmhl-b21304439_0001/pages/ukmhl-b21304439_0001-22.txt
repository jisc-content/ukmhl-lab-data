t> COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. and particularly in the Furrows of Bones, for the trans- mission of Blood-vessels into their substance. Near the middle of most of the Bones, especially the long ones, there is a slanting Canal for the passage of the principal Medullary Vessels. Numerous Orifices, some of them very considerable in size, are observed at the extremities of long Bones. Some serve for the transmission of Blood-vessels, and others for giving attachment to the Fibres of the Liga- ments of the Joints. The principal Vessels pass into the Cancelli, internal Membranes, and Marrow, and return to the solid Sub- stance of the Bone, where they meet those sent inwards from the Periosteum. In some Jlat Bones^ as those of the Cranium^ the Bones are entirely supplied from the Vessels of the surrounding Membranes, and the Vascularity there is uniform. In the Subject, the Blood-vessels of the Bones can be shewn by a successful injection thrown into them j and in living Animals, when the Bones are cut across, their Vascularity appears by the Blood which oozes from their divided extremities. The Vascularity of Bone is also shewn, by feeding an Animal, for some time, on the Rubia Tinctorum, or Madder-root, after which the Bones are found to be completely tinged with the colouring matter of the Madder. As a person advances in life, the Blood-vessels of the Bones contract in their Diameters, as appears from the Bones of old people having less Blood in them than tho?e

78 COMPENDIUxM OF ANATOMY. [PaktI. The t hey are faced with Cartilage, to be articulated with the 'J^iibercles of the Ribs. Tlie Spinous Processes, long, thick at the roots, but slender near the extremities, and pointing obliquely downwards over each other, by which the Spinal Mar- row in this part is well protected. Tlie upper Edge of the Spinous Pi'ocesses of these Vertebra?, formed into a Ridge, which, in certain motions of the Spine, is received by a Groove in the under part of the Spinous Process of the Vertebra im- mediately above it. The last peculiarity of Structure, with the others al- ready mentioned, prevent the Dorsal Vertebrae from liaving much motion. The Jirst Dorsal Vei'tehra, having the whole of the Ih't for the Head of the First Rib formed in it. The twelfth Dorsal Vertebra receiving the whole Head of the last Rib, and having no Cartilaginous Surface on its Transverse Process. The Limbar Vertebra:, or those of the Loins, having their bodies larger and broader than those of the other two classes. The Intervertebral Substances, the thickest of any, and most so at their fore part, by which the Spine is rendered convex there, for the support of the Abdo- minal Bowels. The Oblique Processes, remarkably deep, and placed upright, the Superior Oblique Processes of one Verte- bra facing inwards, and receiving the Inferior Oblique Processes of the Vertebra above it, which are turned in the opposite direction.

286 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartIIL the side ol tlie Atlas, and to tlie inner edge of the Fo- ramen Magnum. They are short, but of great strength, and prevent the Head from turning too far round. The Tramverse Ligamenty which arises from the inner side of tlie Atlas, and, going across behind the Proces- sus Dentatus, is fixed to the opposite side of the Atlas. The edges of this Ligament extend upwards and downwards, and form two Processes, called its Appen- dices^ which are fixed to the Foramen Magnum and Processus Dentatus. The middle of the Ligament is ' remarkably firm where that Process plays upon it. It keeps the Processus Dentatus in its place, and prevents it from injuring the Spinal Marrow in the different mo- tions of the Head. Ligaments of the other Vertebrae. 'I'he Anterior Common Ligament of the Vertebra*, which is a strong Tendinous Band, extending along the convex or outer part of the Vertebrae, from the upper to the under region of the Spine. It begins at the second Cervical ^'^ertebra', and descends as far as the Os Sa- crum, where it spreads out, becomes thinner, and va- nishes about the under part of this Bone. It is much thicker upon the fore part than on the sides of the Ver- tebrai, by which the Bones are more firmly united an- teriorly, and is thinnest in the Neck and Loins, where the motions of the Spine arc greatest. Internally, it is blended with the Periosteum, and, through its whole course, it sends off small Processes to be fixed to the Bodies of the Vertebrae, by which their connection is made

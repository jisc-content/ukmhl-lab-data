Part I.] OF THE BONES. 77 The SpiJKnis Process, thick and strong, to give ori- gin to the Muscles which assist in the extension and ro- O tation of the Head, and tui-ned down to allow these motions to be readily performed. In the Foetus, the Vertebra Dentata consists of four pieces, three of which are common to all the Vertebrae, the fourth is the Processus Dentatus, which is joined by Cartilage to the Body of the Bone. The sevetith Cervical Vertebra, approaching to the form of the Dorsal Vertebrae.—The Spinal and Trans- verse Pi’ocesses have no Bifurcation. The Dorsal Vertebra, or Vertebra of the Back, hoi’i- zontal above and below, having their Bodies larger, sharper before, flatter at the sides, and more hollow be- hind, than those of the Cervical Vertebrae. A Pit, lined with Cartilage at each side of their up- per and under Edges, near the Transverse Processes, for the articulation of the Heads of the Ribs. The hftervcrtebral Substances, thin, to admit only of little motion; and thinnest anteriorly, to enlarge the Curvature of the Spine, and increase the Cavity of the Thorax. The Spinal Canal is here more circular, but corre- sponding with the size of the Spinal Marrow,—is smaller than in any of the other Vertebra?. The Oblique Processes, having nearly a perpendicular direction, the upper ones slanting forwards, and the under ones backwards. The Transverse Processes, long, turned obliquely backwards, and enlarged at their outer extremity, where the} V'

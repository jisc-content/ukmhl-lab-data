A a manner as to allow motion upwards and downwards, though only a small degree in any single Rib, and that towards its middle; but no motion in any other direc- tion. TheJir&t Rib the most crooked; from this downwards the Ribs becoming gradually straighter.' The uppermost Ribs approaching nearer to the hori- zontal situation; their obliquity, with respect to the Spine, increasing as they descend, and their anterior extremities becoming more distant from each other. The Cartilages oi the Ribs,- like the Ribs themselves, becoming gradually longer from the first to the seventh, but, contrary to what happens in the Ribs, approach- ing nearer to each other in their descent. The length of the Ribs, increasing from the first to tlie seventh, and then decreasing to the twelfth. The distance between the heads of the Ribs and their Angles, increasing to the ninth Rib, corresponding with the breadth of the Sacro-Lumbalis which covers them. The Ribs divided into True and False. The True Ribs^—the seven uppermost having their Cartilages joined to the Sternum, and opposed to the Heart.and Lungs, from which they are termed the T?uc CustodcSj or Guards of Life. The False Ribsy—the five inferior, not reaching the Sternum. The Cartilages of the False Ribs, shorter as they de- scend, and more flexible than those of the True Ribs. The posterior Extremity of the first Rib, artiadated only with the first Vertebra of the Back.

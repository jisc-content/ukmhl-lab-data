m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. gaments, that no sensible motion appears in the Sub- joined by an union of Substance. Tlie Fibula affords attachment to Muscles ; assists in securing the Articulation of the Foot; adds to the form •and strength of the Leg •, and, by the head of tlic Bone being fixed to that of the Tibia, it widens the space for the Interosseous Ligament. The subslance of the Tibia and Fibula is like that in other long Bones. * In the Foetus, the extremities of the Fibula are Car- tilaginous, and afterwards become Epiphyses, previous to being united to the Body of the Bone. The Patella, placed at the fore part of the Joint of the Knee, and in some respects bearing the same relation to the Tibia as the Olecranon does to the Ulna. The shape of the Patella, iriangtdar and Jlatf or of the figure of a Heart as painted upon playing-cards. The anterior Surface of the Bone, convex^ and perfo- rated by numerous Holes, for the insertion of Tendons and Ligaments which cover it. The posterior Surface., which corresponds with the Trochlea of the Os Femoris, smooth, covered witli ject j though in this joint, as in several others, where the Bones are firmly fixed by short Ligaments, there may be an elastic yielding in the living Body. In old people, these two Bones arc not unfrequcntly Patella, or Rotula. Cartilage, and divided by a longitudinal prominent Ridge into two unequal Cavities. The circumference of the articular Surface, marked by

Part I.] 47 OF TFIE BONES. qF the Bone, and each hollow at the upper and outer part, for lodging a share of the Temporal Muscles. The Orbitar Platesy at the fore part of the Temporal Wings, forming a portion of the outside of the Orbits. The Spinous Process^ at the under and back part of each Temporal Plate. A Styloid Process^ frequently observed at the point of the Spinous, from botli of which the Circumflexus Pa- lati arises. Between the Temporal and Spinous Processes, an Arch for receiving the fore part of the Temporal Bone. The two Pterygoidy or Aliform Processes, placed al- most perpendicularly to the Base of the Cranium. The Pterygoid Processes are compared to the wings, though more properly resembling the feet, of a Bat. Each is composed of two Plates. The Extmial Plate, broad and hollotv without, where Uie External Pterygoid Muscle has its origin. Between the root of this Plate and that of the Temporal one, a largeâ€™Depression, where the principal part of the exter- nal Pterygoid Muscle has its origin. At the fore j)art of this is another Depression, forming part of the open- ing common to the Sphenoid, and to the Malar and superior Maxillary Bones. ' The internal Plate, natrovoer and longer than the ex- ternal, and, with its fellow on the opposite side, form- ing the back part of the Nose. A Hook-like Process upon the internal Plate, over which the Circumflexus Palati moves. The Fossa Pterygoidea, facing backwards between the Pterygoid

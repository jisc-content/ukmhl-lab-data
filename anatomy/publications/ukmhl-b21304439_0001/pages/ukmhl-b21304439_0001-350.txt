20B COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IIL Ligajients, &c. of ihe Joint of the Elbow. The Capsular Ligament, which arises round the Mar- gin of the Articular Surface, at the Lower End of the (Js Humeri, and is fixed about the edge of the Articu- lar Surface of the Ulna, and also to the Coronary Li- gament of the Radius. The sides of the Elbow-Joint are strengthened hy two Ligamaitous Bands, which adhei'e so firmly to the outer Surface of the Capsular Ligament, that they appear to be part of its Substance, via. The Brachio-Ulnar, or Internal Lateral Ligament, wâ€™hich arises from the fore jxirt of the inner Condyle of the Os Humeri, and spreads out, in a radiated manner, to be fixed to the inside of the Coronoid Process of the Ulna, and I'he Brachio-Radial, or External Lateral Ligament, which is like the former, but larger. It arises from the external Condyle of the Os Humeri, and is expanded upon the Coronary Ligament into which it is inserted. The Coremary, Annular, or Orbicular Ligament of the Radius, which approaches to the firmness of Cartilage. It arises from one side of the small Semilunar Cavity of the Ulna, and, after surrounding the Neck of the Radius, is fixed to the other side of that Cavity. The tipper edge of it is incorporated with, and maybe con- sidered as a part of, the Capsular Ligament, while its under edge is fixed round the Neck of the Radius, al- lowing that Bone to move freely round its own axis, upon

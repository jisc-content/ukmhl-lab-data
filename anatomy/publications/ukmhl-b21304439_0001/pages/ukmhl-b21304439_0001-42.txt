2^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. it is to be obsei'ved, that the term Squamous is also ap- plied to all the Sutures on which the Temporal Muscle is placed ; it therefore includes part of the Coronal and Sphenoid Sutures. ) In the Sutures of the Cranium there are often Addi- tional Bones, called Ossa Triquetra, from their being of a triangular form, and Ossa Wormianaj from Wormius, who, though not the discoverer, gave a description of them. The Ossa Wormiana vary much in figure, size, and number, and arc occasionally found in the different Su- tures, though most frequently in the middle of tlie Ivambdoid. Wherever they occur, the Sutures surrounding them arc observed to be similar to the neighbouring Sutures; of course they are equally with them distinguished from Fractures of the Skull. Between the Bones of the Cranium and those of the Face, fix'e Sutures are also found, and they are said to be common to these two sets of Bones. Parts, however, of these Sutures, are only between the Bones of the Cranium. The Sutures here are. The Ethmoid Suture^ which surrounds the Ethmoid Bone. The S'phenoid Suturey which surrounds the Sphenoid Bone. The Ethmoid and Sphenoid Sutures in some parts .assist in forming other Sutures, especially the Squamous and Transverse ; and in other parts there is but one Suture common to these two Bones. The Transverse SKiwe, which runs across the Or- bits

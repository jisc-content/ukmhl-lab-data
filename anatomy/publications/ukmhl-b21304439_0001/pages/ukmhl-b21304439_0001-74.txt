5S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L The A Notch forming the under and fore part of the Nos- tril, to the edge of which, and to the corresponding one of the Nasal Process, the Cartilages of the side of the Nose are connected. The Alveoli^ or Sockets for the Teetli, porom for the firmer adhesion of the reflected Membrane of the Gums, and for the transmission of Blood-vessels into the Sub- stance of the Bones; the number of Sockets corre- sponding to the Fangs of the Teeth. The Lacrymal Fossuy which, with that of the Os Un- guis, forms a passage for the Lacrymal Duct into the Nose. A Canal in the Orbitar Plate, teiTninated anteriorly by the Foramen iTifra-Orbitarium, through which the infra-Orbitar Branch of the second part of the Fifth Iâ€™air of Nerves, with a Branch of the internal Maxillary Artery, pass to the Face. The Foramen Incisivimj vel Palatinum AnterniSy be- hind the Fore-Teeth, common to both Bones below, but proper to each above, and filled witli a Process of the Soft Palate, and with small Vessels and Nerves^ w'hich run between the Membranes of the Mouth and Nose. In some Subjects, there is a distinct Ductns Incisimis, leading from one, or from each Nostril into the Cavity, of the Mouth, similar to that which is always found in the large Quadrupeds. A small Hole commonly found in the Nasal Process, and some minute Passages at the back part of the Tube- rosity, for the transmission of Blood-^'^essels and Nerves into the Substance of the Bone and Teeth, and into the Antrum Maxillare.

2y OF THE BONES. Part I.] The side of the middle of each Superciliary Ridge, through which a branch of the Ocular Artery, and part of .the Ophthalmic Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, pass to the soft parts of the Forehead. In some Skulls, the Vessels and Nerves are lodged in Furrows on the Surface of the Bone. Frequently, instead of a Hole, a Notch only is seen, the Vessels and Nerves then passing over the Superci- liary Ridge •, or two Holes in one side, and one in the other, &c. The Foramina Orbitaria Interna^ Anteriiis et Poslc~ riusy between the Orbitar Plates of the Frontal and Eth- moid Bones, and about three-fourths of an inch distant from each other, through which small Twigs of Nerves from the first part of the Fifth Pair, and of Arteries from the Ocular Artery, pass into the Nose. • Small Perforations are found upon the under and fore part of the Frontal Bone, for the transmission of very minute Arteries or Nerves into the Sinuses, or to the Substance of the Bone. The concave inner and lore part of the Os Frontis, for lodging the Anterior Lobes of the Brain. The convex under parts, for supporting these Lobe?, and covering the Eyes. ' The Ridges and Depressions of the Orbitar Processes, marked by the convolutions of the Brain. Small Fuiro'ws on the inside of the Bone, for lodging the Blood-vessels of the Dura Mater. ' ' Slight Sinuosities, more evident on the under than on the upper part of the Bone, occasioned by the convolu- tions of the anterior part of the Brain.

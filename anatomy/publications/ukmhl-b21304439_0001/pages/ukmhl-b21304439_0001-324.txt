272 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOxMY. [PartIII. Some of the Bursaj of contiguous Tendons commu- nicate with each other; as between the Extensor Carpi iiadialis and Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis. Others communicate, not only in Adults, but often also in Children, with the Cavity of the Joints ; as be- hind the Tendon of the Extensors of the Leg; though this is more frequently the case in advanced age. Their Structure is the same with that of the inner Layer of the Capsular Ligament of the Joints. Like that, they are formed of a thin Pellucid Mem- brane, possessing little Sensibility, and joined to tlie surrounding parts by Cellular Substance, which, in many places, is intermixed with Fat. Like the Capsule of the Joint, they .have commonly a thin Layer of Cartilage, or of tough Membrane, be- tween them and the Bone. Like it, they have reddish-coloured Musses of Fat projecting into their Cavities, from the edges of which Fringes are sent off; as behind the Ligament of the Pa- tella, or at the Insertion of the Tendo Achillis. Like it also, the inside of the Bursm is remarkably smooth, being lubricated with the same kind of Gelati- nous Mucus which is found in the Cavities of the Joints; â€”the Mucus serving the same general purpose with that of the Joints, viz. to lessen Friction, and prevent the consequences which would otherwise result from it.

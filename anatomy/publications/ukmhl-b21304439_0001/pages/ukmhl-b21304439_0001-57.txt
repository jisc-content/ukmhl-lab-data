Part L] 41 OF THE BONES. Artery to, and of the Great Sympathetic Nerve from, the Brain. In the upper and back part of the Canal, one, some- times two, minute Holes are observed, through which the internal Carotid Arteiy sends one or two Twigs to the Tympanum. The Iter a Palate ad Aurenit or Emtacliian' Tube, between the Fissure for the Capsular Ligament of the Lower Jaw, and the passage of the internal Carotid Artery, extending outwards and backwards in an hori- zontal direction, till it terminates in the Tympanum. In the Subject, it is formed, by the addition of Car- tilage and Ligament, into a trrmipet-like Tube, which is continued forwards and inwards to the back part of the Nostril, and conveys air from the Nose to the Tym- panum of the Ear. The Foramen Mastoideimij occasionally found at the back part of the Mastoid Process, or in the Lambdoid Suture. When present, it sometimes transmits an Ar- tery to the Dura Mater, but more commonly a Vein from the Integuments of the Head to the Lateral Sinus. Sometimes two or three Foramina Mastoidea are ob-’ serv^, serving the same purpose with that already no- ticed ; but these, like all the other passages for Veins leading into the Sinuses, are very uncertain. The tipper and inner Edge of the Squamous Plate formed into Ridges and Fwtro’ii's, where it is connected with the Parietal Bone. The inner Surface of the Squamous Plate, tineqiial M’here it is marked by the Convolutions of the middle part

118 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Round the Heads, a depression, for the insertion of the Capsular Ligaments. The Metacarpal Bones are joined by their Bases to the Carpus, and to each other by nearly plain Surfaces i in const^uence of which, and the strength of their con- necting Ligaments, their motions here are inconsider- able. The Base of the Metacarpal Bone of the Fore-finger, opposed to, and corresponding with, the Os Trape- zoides, and partly with the Os Trapezium. The inner part of the Base, forming a Ridge, which is articulated with the Os Magnum, and with the next Metacarpal Bone. The connection of the Base is so firm, that it has little or no motion. The Metacarpal Bone of the Mid-fnger, commonly tlie second in length. The Base pf the Bone generally slanting inwards and downwards, opposed to the Os Magnum. The outer and back part of the Base projecting, and forming a sort oi Process, the external Surface of which is connected with the Ridge of the former Bone. Iâ€™he motion of this Bone is little more than that of the former one. The Metacarpal Bone of the Ring-finger, shorter than the former Bone. Its Base, semicircular where it is opposed to the Os Uncifonne. The motion is something greater than that of the for- mpr Bone.

I Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS,-&c. 299 upon the Articular Surface of the Os Humeri, and in the small Semilunar Cavity of the Ulna. Besides the Ligaments already described, there are others which run in various directions upon the fore and back parts of the Joint, contributing to its strength, and having tlie names of Anteinor and Posterior Acces- sory Ligaments. There are also two Tendinous Substances, termed Inter-muscular Ligaments of the Os Humeri^ which ex- tend along the under and lateral parts of this Bone, giving origin to part of the Muscles situated at this part of the Arm. The Ligaments and Bones of the Joint of the Elbow form a complete Hinge, which allows the Fore Arm to have free flexion and extension upon the Os Humeri, but no rotation when the Arm is in the extended state, though a small degree of it is perceptible when the Joint is moderately bent, and the Ligaments thereby relaxed. Within th<j Capsular Ligament, and chiefly in the upper part of the Pit of the Os Humeri in wliich the Olecranon plays, the Patty Substance is lodged for the lubrication of the Joint. A similar: Substance^ but much smaller in quantity,, is tlso found in the Depression in which the Coronoid Process of the Ulna moves, i Ligaments between the Bodies^ and between the Under Ends of the Radius and Ulna. The Inter osseous Ligament^ which extends between tlie sharp

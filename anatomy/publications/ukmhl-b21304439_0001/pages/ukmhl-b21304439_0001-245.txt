193 Part IL] OF THE MUSCLES. MUSCLES SITUATED WITHIN THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. Diaphragma. The Diaphragm forms a Fleshy-ard Tendinous Par- tition, which separates the Cavity of the Abdomen from that of the Thorax, and is perforated by several Holes, ; for the passage of Vessels and Nerves which go into, or I come out from tlie Abdomen. It is concave below, and I convex above; the middle of it reaching as high within I the Thorax as the fourth pair of Ribs. Above, it is • covered by the Pleura, and below, by the Peritoneum j I and is commonly divided into two portions, called Su- iperior and Inferior Muscles of the Diaphragm. Superior, or Greater Muscle of the Diaphragvi, Origin: By Fleshy Indentations, from the Cartilage lEnsiformis, and from the Cai’tilages of the seventh, and cof all the inferior Ribs on both sides. From these dif- fferent Origins, the Fibres run in a radiated manner. Insertion : Into a Cordiform Tendon, placed in the imiddle of the Diaphragm, and in which the Fibres of tthe opposite sides are interlaced.—Towards the right sside, the Tendon is’ perforateil by a triangular Hole for tthe passage of the Vena Cava Inferior; and to the upper (.convex part of it, the Pericardium and Mediastinum ^i»re connected.

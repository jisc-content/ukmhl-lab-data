Part I.] 117 . OF THE BONES. Metacarpal Bones of the Fingers. Their bodies long and round, behind, forming part of 1 the -convexity of the Hand j before, giving hollowness t to the Palm. The extremities of these Bones, considerably larger I than their bodies, in consequence of which they leave : spaces for the Interossei. The upper ends or basesy faty where they are articu- 1 lated with the Bones of the Carpus. Round the edges of the Cartilaginous Surfaces, at the i upper ends, the depressio?is wheiâ€™e the Capsular Liga- jinents are fixed. The sides of the upper ends faty and drawn close to- {gether, where they are articulated with each other. Their Bodies diverging towards their under extremi- t ties, by which they regulate the motions of the Fingers. A Ridge at the upper and back part of their Bodies, 1 with a depression on each side of it, formed by the In- t terossei. The under and back part of their Bodies, made flat Iby the motion of the Tendons of the Extensors of the 1 Fingers. The anterior Surface of their Bodies concavey and 1 rendered fat at the sidesy by the Interossei Muscles. The lower endsy or headsy formed into Balls, which i are flattened upon their sides by their motions upon teach other. At the fore part of each side of the Heads, a little prominence, for the attachment of the Ligaments which f fix these Bones to each other. H 3 Round 1

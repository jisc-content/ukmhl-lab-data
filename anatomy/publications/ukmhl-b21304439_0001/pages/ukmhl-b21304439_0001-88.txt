TRUE VERTEBRJE, Twenty-four in Number. Each of the true Vertebrae composed of a Body and Pi'ocesscs. The Body of a spongy nature, with upper and wider Surfaces placed horizontally. The anterior convexity of the Body, and posterior concavity. Numerous small Holes on the anterior and lateral parts of the Body, for the passage of Blood-vessels into the Substance of the Bone, or for the attachment of Liga- mentous Fibres. A Ring of Bone, at the upper and under edges of the Body, of a firmer texture than the rest of its sub- stance, and thereby adding to the general strength of the Bone.

210 OF THE MUSCLES. Part IL] Teres Ma.tor, vel Scapulo-Humei-alis. Origin: Fleshy, from the Dorsal side of the inferior Angle of the Scapula, and from a small part of its infe- rior Costa. It is situated at the under part of the Teres Minor, and sends off a broad flat Tendon, which ac- companies that of the Latissimus Dorsi. Insertion: Along with the Latissimus Dorsi, into the Ridge at the inner side of the Groove for lodging the Tendon of the Long Head of the Biceps. Action: To roll the Humerus inwards, and to draw it backwards and downwards. Deltoides, vel Suh-Acromio-Hiimeralis. t Origin: Fleshy, from all the outer part of the Clavicle nnoccupicd by the Pectoralis Major, from whicli it is separated by a small Fissure; Tendinous and Fleshy, from the Acromion, and lower Mai'gin of almost the whole Spine of the Scapula, opposite to the insertion of the Trapezius. From these Origins it runs, under the appearance of three Muscles going in different directions, and sepa- rated from each other by slight Fissures j viz. from the Clavicle outwards, from the Acromion downwards, and from the Spine of the Scapula forwards; and is com- posed of a number of Fasciculi, forming a strong Fleshy Muscle, which covers the joint of the Os Humeri. Insertion; Below that of the Pectoralis Major, by a short and strong Tendon, into a rough Surface, on the outer i-i.

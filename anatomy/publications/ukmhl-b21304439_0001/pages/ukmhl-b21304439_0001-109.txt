OF THE BONES. ’Part L] 93 a v)art of the Thorax, and the flat Surface opposed to the Xiungs. The upper Edge of the Rib, rotmd where the Inter- :costales are fixed. The tender Edge^ shatp where the Intercostalis Exter- nus is fixed. A Fossa at the inside of the under Edge, for lodging hhe Intercostal Vessels and Nerves. The upper edge of tkhe Fossa gives origin to the Intercostalis Internus. The Fossa wanting towards the extremities of the PRibs; the Vessels not being in contact with them be- :iaind, and too small to impress them anteriorly. An Oval Pit in the anterior extremity of each Rib, for receiving the Cartilage which runs from it to tlie >Sternum. The Cartilages of the Ribs, placed between them and khe Sternum. The Cartilages, like the 'R\hs,Jlat on their outer and linncr Surfaces, and smooth where they are opposed to ithe Lungs. The Cartilage of each Rib, forming, with the Rib titself, a Curve, the concave part upwards. And with the Sternum, an obtuse Angle above, and lan acute one below. The Cartilages yield to the motions of the Ribs, and ‘enable them to return to their former position, when khe Muscles cease to act. The Cartilages of tlie Ribs, rin old people, are frequently ossified. The Ribs ai’e connected behind to the Vertebrae by a double articulation, and before to the Sternum by the Cartilages, or by the Cartilages to each other, in such

. OF THE BONES. Part I.] Femoris, their solid sides, near their middle, are re- markably thick, and there the Cancelli are scarcely per- ceptible; while at their extremities, their sides are scarcely thicker than writing-paper, and their Cancelli are so numerous as to occupy the whole space between their sides. The Cancelli of Bones are formed by the internal Plates passing inwards, and decussating each other j and in the long Bones, the sides of the Bone, in con- sequence of sending off the Cancelli, become gradually thinner towards its extremities, while the Cancelli in proportion become more numerous. The Cancelli, though extremely minute, exist even in the most solid parts of Bones, as can be seen by ex- posure to heat, or in Bones enlarged by disease. In either of these cases, small Cells may be observed, and aro distinguishable from the Canals for containing the Vessels, the former being irregular, and the lattet cy- lindrical. » The Cancelli support the Membranes containing the Marrow’, as the Cellular Substance does the Fat, and prevent one part of the Column of Marrow from gra- vitating upon another in the various positions of the Body. They also furnish a wider surface for the dis- persion of the Arteries which secrete the Marrow. Upon the surface of Bones there are numerous Fis~ suresy for the more intimate connection of the Perios- teum with the Bone, and for lodgement to Blood-vessels, which pass into its Substance. • Many minute Orifices are observed upon the surface, A 3 and I

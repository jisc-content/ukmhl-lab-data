62 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. mold Cells, by the Ethmoid Suture ;â€”and to its fellow, by the longitudinal Palate Suture. In the Fcptus, the Palate-Bone is complete, but there are no Cells in the Orbitar Processes. Ossa Spongiosa, vel Turbinata Inferiora. The situation of each in the under part of the side of the Nose. Its Triangular form and spongy appearance, resem- bling the Os Spongiosum Superius. Its Convexity towards the Septum Nasi, and Concavity outwards. The under edge placed horizontally near the under part of the Nose, and ending in a sharp point behind. The /ifo Processes at the upper part of the Bone, the anterior ascending and forming part of the Lacrymal Groove, and the posterior descending in form of a Hook, to make part of tlie Side of the Maxillary Sinus. I'he Connection of this Bone to the Os Maxillare, Os Palati, and Os Unguis, by a distinct Suture in the young Subject; but in the Adult, by a concretion of substance. The Ossa Spongiosa afford a large surface for extend- ing the Organ of Smell, by allowing the Membrane of the Nose to be expanded, upon which the Olfactory Nerves are dispersed. In the Foetus, the'se Bones are almost complete.

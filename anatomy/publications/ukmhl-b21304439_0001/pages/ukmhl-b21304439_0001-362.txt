The Capsular Ligament, along with the other Liga- ments of this Joint, admits of the flexion and extension of the Leg, but of no lateral nor rotatory motion in the extended state, though of a small degree of each when the Limb is fully bent. The Ligame^tum Alare^ Mojus et Minus, which are Folds of the Capsular Ligament, running like tVings at the sides of the Patella, to which, and to the Fatty Substance of the Joint, they are attached. J'he Ligamentum Mucosum, continued from the join- ing of the Ligamenta Alaria to the Os Femoris, imme- diately above the Anterior Crucial Ligament. It pre- serves the Synovial Substance in its proper place, dur- ing the various motions of the Joint. I'he tiao Crucial, or Internal Ligaments, which arise from the Semilunar Notch between the Condyles of the Os Femoris, and decussate each other within the Cavity of the Joint. > The Anterior Crucial Ligament runs downwards and forwards, to be fixed to a Pit before the rough Protu- berance in the middle of the Articulating Surface of the Head of the Tibia. The Posterior Crucial Ligament descends to be fixed to a Pit behind the above-mentioned rough Protuberance. These Ligaments, in the extended state of the Leg, prevent it from going forwards beyond a straight line with the Thigh. When the Knee is bent, they allow the Fpot to be turned out\yards, but nptiu the contrary direction. The

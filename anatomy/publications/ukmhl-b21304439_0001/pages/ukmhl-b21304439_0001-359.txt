Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. 50'7 Fascia Lata and surrounding Muscles ; but the strong- est of these Slips arises with diverging Fibres from the inferior-anterior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium. The Capsular Ligament allows the Thigh-bone to be moved to every side; and when its Body is moved for- wards or backwards, a small degree of rotation is per- formed round the Cervix of the Bone. The Internal, co-mmonly called the Round Ligament, •which arises by a broad flat beginning from the under and inner part of the Cavity of the Acetabulum, and is connected with the Substance termed Gland of the Joint. From this it runs backwards and a little upwards, be- coming gradually narrower and rounder, to be fixed to the Pit upon the inner Surface of the Ball of the Os Femoris. The Round Ligament prevents the Bone from being dislocated upwards or inwards, and assists in agitating the Mucous Substance within the Joint. A Cartilaginous Ligameid surrounding the Brim of the Acetabulum, and thereby increasing the depth of that Cavity for the reception of the Head of the Thigh- bone. ’ A Double Cartilaginous Ligament, stretched from one end of the Breach in the under and fore part of the Acetabulum, to the other, but leaving a Hole behind it for containing part of the Substance called Glaiid of the Joint, and for the passage of the Vessels of that Sub- stance. Tiiis Ligament allows the Tliigh-bone to be moved inwards, and the Glandular-looking Substance to be agitated with safety. U2 Tire

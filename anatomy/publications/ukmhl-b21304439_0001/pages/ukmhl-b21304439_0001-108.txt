i 02 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. number of the Dorsal Vertebrce always corresponding with that of the Ribs. Iâ€™lieir Figurcy convex externally, by which their strength is increased; and concave and smooth internally, with their flat sides turned towards the Lungs, which they protect. The Head of each Rib formed into a Ridge and too hollovD Surfaces covered with Cartilage, to be articulated with the bodies of two Vertebras and their intermediate II Cartilage. Round the Head, the Bone spongy^ for the attach- ment of the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. The Tubercle of the Rib, at a little distance from its Head, with a flat Cartilaginous Surface and irregular Edge, to be articulated to the Transverse Process of the undermost of the two Vertebrae, to which the head of the Rib is joined. The Cervix of the Rib, between its Head and Tu- bercle, of a roundish form. Another small Tubercle in most of the Ribs, at the outer side of the former, for the attachment of Liga- ments which fix the Ribs to each other, and to the Transverse Processes ; and also for the insertion of the outer Slips of the Longissimps Dorsi. Beyond the Tubercle, the Rib rendered Jlat by the Sa cro- Lumbal is. The Angle of the Ribs to which the Sacro-Lumbalis is fixed, where the Bones are about to bend, to form the lateral part of the Thorax. The Rib becoming broader and flatter at the lateral part /

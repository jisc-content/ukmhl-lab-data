2ir Fart II.] OF THE MUSCLES'. • MuLTiriDUS Spin^, I’orraerly described as three distinct Muscles, viz. Tra?is- verso-Spinalis Lumborum, Transverso-Spinalis Dorsi, and Tramverso-Spinalis Colli. 0)-igin: From the side and Spinous Processes of the I Os Sacrum, and from that part of the Os Ilium which j joins with the Sacrum; from all the Oblique and Trans- ’ verse Processes of the Lumbar Vertebrae ; from all the ' Transverse Processes of the Dorsal, and of the four In- Iferior Cervical Vertebrae, by as many distinct Tendons, ’ which soon become Fleshy, and run obliquely upwards I and inwards. Insertion: By distinct Tendons, into all the Spinous . Processes of the Lumbar, Dorsal, and Cervical Verte- ! brae, excepting the Atlas. Action: To extend the Spine obliquely, and pull it to : a side. When both Muscles act, they draw the Spine I directly backwards. Semi-Spinalis Colli, Vel Transverso-Spinalis Colli. Origin: From the Transverse Processes of the six 1 uppermost Dorsal Vertebrae, by an equal number of \ distinct Tendons, wliich run obliquely under the Com- I plexus. O 2 Insertion : 4

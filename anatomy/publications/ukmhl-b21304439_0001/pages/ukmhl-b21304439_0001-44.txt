28 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Superciliary Ridgesy on which the Eye-Brows ara placed, extending between the external and internal Angular Processes on each side. Projections, generally seen above the inner ends of the Superciliary Ridges, indicating the situation of the Cavities called Frontal Simeses. The Nasal Process, placed between the internal An- gular Processes, and forming part of the Nose. Part of the Temporal Process, or Ridge, on each side, behind the external Angular Process, which forms the boundary between the 'I'emporal and Frontal Muscles. The Orbitar Processes, or Plates, which, contraa*y to (he rest of tlie Bone, are hollow below, and extend a considerable way back, to form the upper parts of the Orbits for lodging the Eyes and their Appendages. The Orbitar Plates, contrary to the other parts of the Bone, are rendered so thin by the pressure of the Brain and Eye on the opposite sides, that they becopie transparent, and the Cancelli, especially in old people, are obliterated. The Sinuosity at the upper part of the Orbit, behind the outer end of the Superciliary Ridge, on each side, for lodging the Lacrymal Qland. Behind each internal Angular Process, a small Pit, to which the Cartilaginous Pulley of the Superior Ob- lique Muscle is fixed. The Temporal Fossa, behind the Temporal Process, for lodging part of the Muscle of that name. The Opening .between the Orbitar Processes, for re- ceiving the Cribriform Plate of the Etlimoid Bone. I'he Foramen Supra-orbitarium, a little to the inner- side

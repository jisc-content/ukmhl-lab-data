289 Faht liL] OF THE LIGAMENTS, See. j The External Ligaments of the Necks of the RibSf j called Ligamenta Transversaria Externa. They arise ! from the points of the Transverse Processes externally, and are fixed to the back part of the Necks of the Ribs. Ligamenta Cervicis Costanm Externa, or External LignmeiUs of the Necks of the Ribs, whidi ai-ise from the external Margins of the inferior oblique Processes, and descend obliquely outwards, to be fixed to the upper and outer part of the Necks of all the Ribs. The Ligaments at this end of the Ribs, together with the situation of the Transverse Processes, admit of their motion upwards and downwards, but prevent them from moving in any other direction. Short Ligamentous Fibres, which run from the Mar- gins of the anterior, extremities of the Ribs to the Mar- gins of their corresponding Cartilages; the Cartilages and Ribs being joined by an union of Substance. Radiated Ligaments, whicli go from the anterior Sur- faces of the Capsular Ligaments over the external Sur- face of the Sternum. Many of the Fibres of these Ligaments intermix with their fellows on the opposite side. The Capsular Ligaments of the Cartilages of the Ribs, which arise from the Margins of the Articular Cavities ' of the Sternum, and are fixed round the extremities of the seven True Ribs. Membrane proper to the Sternum, which is a firm Ex- ] pension, composed of Tendinous Fibres running in dif- ferent directions, but chiefly in a longitudinal one, and â–  covering the anterior and posterior Surfaces of the Bone, VoL.

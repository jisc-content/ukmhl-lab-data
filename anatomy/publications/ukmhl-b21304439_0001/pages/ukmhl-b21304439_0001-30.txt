U COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part!. The Ossification of broad Bones begins, in some, as in those of the Cranium, between Membranes only, and in others, as in the Ossa Ilia, in Cartilage, and it ap- pears in each Bone in one or more places; There the Osseous Particles are so joined together, as to have a Fibrous appearance. The Fibrous Structure is most distinctly seen in the Cranium of a Foetus about three months after Concep- tion, where the beginning of the Ossification is like a fine irregular net-work, in the middle of which the Fibres are more closely connected than in the circum- ference. In viewing the flat Bones of a Foetus a little more ad- vanced, the bony particles are observed to be so dis- posed, as to have a distinct radiated appearance. The vacancies between the Fibres, which occasion the radiated appearance, are found by Injection to be chief- ly passages for Blood-vessels. As the Foetus increases in size, the Osseous Fibres increase in number, till a Lamina is produced ; and as the Bone continues to grow, more Laminae are added, till the more solid part of a Bone is formed. . The Inner Layers of the Bones are observed to be more porous than the Outer, and none of them are found to have the solidity they acquire in the Adult state, till they have arrived at their full growth. The Ossification of long Bones begins between the Periosteum and Mernbrana Medullaris, by a central Bing, from which the Fibres extend towards the ends of the Bones.

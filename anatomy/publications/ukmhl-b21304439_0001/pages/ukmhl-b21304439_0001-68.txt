Jn the Foetus, the Temporal Wings are separated from the Body of the Bone by Maceration, and there are no Sphenoid Sinuses. OF THE BONES OF THE FACE. The Bones of tlic Face, and the relative proportions between the Face and Cranium, vary considerably a- mong people of different nations, but they likewise vary among the individuals of the same country. It is diffi- cult, therefore, to ascertain the proportions with accu- racy. An Angle termed Facial, however, is considered by some late Authors as being the simplest method of determining this circumstance. The Facial Angle is formed by drawing a line through the external Auditory Passage and bottohi of the Nos- tril, and another, termed Facial, from the convexity of the Forehead to the under and fore part of the Upper Jaw, so os to intersect the former. In the Grecian, the Facial Angle is found to bo be- tween 90° and 100° ; in the European, between 80° and 90° j and in the African, on account of the greater pro- minence of the Jaws, about 70°.

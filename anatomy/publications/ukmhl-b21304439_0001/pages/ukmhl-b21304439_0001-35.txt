OF THE BONES. Part I.] OF THE SKELETON. Though the term Skeleton be applied to a variety of Substances, yet, in Anatomy, it is always understood to signify the Bones of Animals, connected together in their natural situation, after the soft parts of the Body in general are removed. It is termed a Natural Skeleton, when the Bones are joined by their own Ligaments ; And an Artificial Skeleton, when joined by Wire, &c. Small Subjects, and the Bones of those which aro not fully ossified, are most conveniently prepared the first way; while the Bones of large Adult Animals arc more readily cleaned when single, and are easily restored to their natural situation. In viewing the Bones in their natural situation in the Skeleton, scarcely any of them are obsei’vod to be placed in a perpendicular direction to another •, yet in an erect posture, a perpendicular line from their common centre of gravity falls in the middle of their common base. On this account, the Body is found to be as firmly sup- ported, as if the axis of all the Bones had been a straight line perpendicular to the horizon, and much greater quickness, ease, and strength, is given to the Body, in several of its most necessary motions. The Fluman Skeleton is generally divided into FleaJ, Trunk, Superior and Inferior Extremities.

114. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. convexity, by which they are articulated with the lower end of the Bones of the Fore-arm ; the Ossa Scaphoides and Lunare being received in the Socket formed by the Radius, while the Os Cuneiforme is opposed to the Cartilaginous end of the Ulna. By this kind of arti- culation, extensive motion is allowed forwards and back- wards, and to each side ; and by a succession of these motions, the Hand is made to move in a circle, but no motion is performed by the Carpus round its own axis, except what it has along with the Radius in the Supina- tion and Pronation of the Hand. The Os PisiFOiiME, placed upon the anterior and inner Surface of the Os Cuneiforme, forming a Promi- nence which is readily felt in the Wrist, and which gives attachment to strong Tendons and Ligaments, particu- larly to part of the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare. The Os Trapezium, named from the four unequal Edges of its posterior Surface. The Situation of this Bone, at the root of the Meta- carpal Bone of the Thumb. The upper part of the Bone, forming a smooth Pit, to be articulated with the Os Scaphoides. The inner side, hollo'x, and articulated with the Os Trapezoides. The under Surface, forming a Pulley, on which the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb moves. The anterior Surface, sending out a Process, which is prominent in the Palm, and marked by the Trans- verse

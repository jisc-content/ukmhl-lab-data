Part L] OF THE BONES. ,â€™jij The posterior Depression, the larger of the two, form- ing part of the Orbit. The anterior Depression, lodging part of the Lacry- mal Sac and Duct, and perforated by small Holes, through whicli Fibres pass, to make a firm connection between the Bone and its investing Membrane. The inner Surface, composed of a Fw'row and in:o hregular convex Surfaces, corresponding with the ante- rior Ethmoid Cells. The Substance of the Bone is the thinnest and most brittle of any in the Body. Its Connection to the Frontal Bone, by the Trans- verse Suture, and to the Os Planum by the Ethmoid Suture. Internally, it is connected with the Etlimoid Cells. In the Foetus, it is fully formed. Ossa Malaruw. \ The Situation of each in the outer pai-t of the Cheek. The external convex, smooth Surface. The posterior hollow Surf ace, for lodging part of die Temporal Muscle. The superior Orbitar Process, forming part of the outside of the Orbit. The inferior' Orbitar Process, forming part of the lower Edge of the Orbit. . 1 he Maxillary Process, forming the under part of the Prominence of the Cheek. 1 he Arch between the Orbitar Processes, which forms D d< near

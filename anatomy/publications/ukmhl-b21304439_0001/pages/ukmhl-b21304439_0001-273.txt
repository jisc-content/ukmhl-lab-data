t ^ Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. MUSCLES CHIEFLY SITUATED ON THE ARM, SEUVIN& FOR THE MOTION OF THE FORE-ARM. Aponeurosis of the Superior Extremity. The greater part of the Superior Extremity is cover- ed by a Tendinous Membrane or Aponeurosis, whicli ari?es from the Bones of, and Muscles on, the Shoulder. On the Humerus, it incloses the Flexor and Extensor Muscles of the Fore-Arm, and is connected to the Ridges and Condyles at the under end of the Os Humeri. At the bending of the Elbow, it receives considerable additions from the Tendons of the Biceps and Triceps of the Fore-Arm, where the Fibres from the opposite sides decussate each other. ' It becomes thicker and stronger on the Fore-Arm, and forms a firm covering to the Muscles there. o In its descent, it gives off among the Muscles, Par- titions which are fixed to the Radius and Ulna. The Membrane is at length lost insensibly upon the Hand. It is thicker and stronger on the outer than upon the inner side of the Extremity, particularly on the Fore- Arm, at the under and back part of which it forms a thick and strong Band, which, running transversely, gets the name of LigamenUm Carpi Annulare Postcrius. The use of this Aponeurosis, like that in other parts of the Body, is to brace the Muscles, by keeping them in their proper place while in action, and to give origin to

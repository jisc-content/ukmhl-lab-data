I M |j Part I.] OF THE BONES. 75 the Bony Arch, the Oblique Processes complete, the bccfiniiing Transverse Processes, but no Spinal Process. The Vertebrae divided into seven Cervical, tvcelve Dor- sal, and Jive Lumbar. The Cervical Vertebrcc, or Vertebra: of the Neck, hav- ing their Bodies smaller, more fattened before and be- hind, and mo^'e hollowed above and below, than those of the other Vertebrae. The Aiiicidating Processes, more obliqtie than the rest. The Transverse Processes, perforated for the passage of the Vertebral Blood-vessels, and hollowed above for the transmission of the Spinal Nerves. The Spinal Processes, placed horizontally, than the rest, and forked for the attachment of Muscles. Tlie Cervical Vertebrae admit of free motion, in con- sequence of the thickness of their Cartilages, and the nature of their Processes, but give less protection behind to the Spinal Marrow than is given in other parts of the Spine. The first Vertebra, called Atlas, from its supporting tlie Globe of the Head, having only a small Arch in- stead of a Body. The upper and under Surfaces of the Arch, marked by the Ligaments which fix it to the Head and second Vertebra. The back part of the Arch, hollffw, and covered bp a smooth Cartilage, where it turns upon the Processus â€¢Dentatus of the second Vertebra. 1 he inner parts of the sides of the Vertebra, between the superior and inferior Oblique Processes, marked by the Lateral Ligaments which go to the Processus Den- tatus, I

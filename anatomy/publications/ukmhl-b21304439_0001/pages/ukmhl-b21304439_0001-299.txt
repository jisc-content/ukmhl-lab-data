Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 24-7 ✓ Gemini, vel Gemelliy vel lichio-Trochanterius. Origin: By two distinct Heads; the superior from the Spinous Process, and the inferior from the Tubero- sity of the Os Ischium, and from the Sacro-Sciatic Li- gament. The two Heads are united by a Tendinous and Fleshy Membrane, and form a Sheath for the re- ception of the Tendon of the Obturator Internus. Insertion ; Tendinous and Fleshy, into the Cavity at the inner side of the root of the Trochanter Major, on each side of the Tendon of the Obturator Internus, to which they firmly adhere. Action; To roll the Thigh outwards, and to prevent the Tendon of the Obturator Internus from starting out of its place while the Muscle is in action. Obturator Internus, Vel Marsifpialis, vel Szih-Puhio- Trochanicrius Internus. Origin : Within the Pelvis, by a semicircular Fleshy margin, from the anterior half of the Foramen I'hyroi- deum, and, in part, from the Obturator Ligament. Its Fibres converge, and send off a round Tendon, which passes over the Os Ischium, between the Spine and Tuber of that Bone, as a rope passes over a pulley.— W'here it goes over the Capsular Ligament of the Thigh- bone, it is inclosed in the Sheath of the Gemini. Jnsei tion: By a round Tendon, along with the Gemi- ni, into the large Pit at the root of the Trochanter Major. Action : To roll the Thigh obliquely outwards. Q 4- Quadratus

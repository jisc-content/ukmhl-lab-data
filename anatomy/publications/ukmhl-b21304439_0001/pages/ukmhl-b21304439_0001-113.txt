Part I.] OF THE BONES. 97 The VoL. I. G I having a Pit upon each side, for receiving the Cartilage I of the first Rib. Part of the Pit 'm each of the under Corners of the first . Piece, for the Cartilage of the second Rib. The second piece of the Sternum, of an oblong form, Ibut a little broader below than above, and considerablj llonger than the former. Complete Pits upon the edges of this piece, for the Car- ttilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth pair of Ribs, jand part of the Pits for those of the second and seventh. Lines extending across the Bone, between the Pits, edenoting the original marks of division of this piece. i The Connection of the second piece of the Sternum tto the first by Cartilage, which, in the earlier period of Uife, allows some yielding, but this becoming gradually Hess as the person advances in life. The third piece of the Sternum, cartilaginous in a \young Subject, and pointed like a bi'oad-sword, hence itermed Cartilago Ensiformis. The Adult has this piece commonly ossified in the middle, and cartilaginous at the edges. The Size of this piece muck legs than that of the other ttwo. t Only owe half of the Pit, for the Cartilage of the se- iventh Rib, formed in each side of this piece. The Variations of the Cartilago Ensiformis are con- Fsiderable in different Subjects;â€”for, instead of the xommon form, it is sometimes narrow like the point of u small sword, or turned obliquely to one side, or for- wards, or backwards, "or forked at the point, or perfo- :rated in the middle.

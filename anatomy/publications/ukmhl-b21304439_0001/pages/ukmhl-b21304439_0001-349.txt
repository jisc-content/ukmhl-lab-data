297 Fart III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. The Pro'per Posterior Ligament of the Scapula, wliich is sometimes double, and is stretched across the Semi- lunar Notch of the Scapula, forming that Notch into one or two Holes for the passage of the superior-poste- ripr Scapulary Vessels and Nerve. Ligaments, &c. of the Joint of the Shoulder. The Capsular Ligament, which arises from the Cervix of the Scapula, behind the Margin of the Glenoid Ca- vity, and is fixed round the Neck of the Os Humerii loosely inclosing the Ball of that Bone. A ^nall Fmhriated Oigan within the Capsular Liga- ment, for the Secretion of tlie Synovia. A Sheath sent down from the fore part of the Capsu- lar Ligament, between the Tuberosities of the Os Hu- meri, which incloses the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps Flexor Cubiti, and prevents it from starting out of its place. Additional Liganmitous Bands of the Capsular Liga- jnent, which adhere to its anterior Surface.—What gives most strength to this Joint, as well as to several other Joints of the Body, is the covering from the sur- rounding Muscles. From the shallowness of the Glenoid Cavity, from the extent and looseness of the Capsular Ligament, and from the Structure of the other parts of the Joint, more • extensive motion is allowed to the Os Humeri than to any other Bone of the Body ; as it can not only move 1 freely to every side, but also possesses a considerable de- gree of motion upon its own axis.

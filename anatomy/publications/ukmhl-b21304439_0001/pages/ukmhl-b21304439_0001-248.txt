196 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. MUSCLES Transverse Processes of the last Dorsal, and of all the Lumbar Vertebrae, by an equal number of Fleshy Slips, which uniting, form a thick strong Muscle, which bounds the upper part of the side of the Pelvis; passing down over the Os Pubis, behind Poupart’s Ligament. Insertion : Tendinous and Fleshy, into the Trochan- ter Minor, and part of the Body of the Os P'emoris. ActionTo bend the Thigh, and turn it a little out- wards, or, when the Inferior Extremity is fixed, to assist in bending the Body. Iliacus Internus, vel Ilio~Trochaniinem. Origin: F'lcshy, from the Transverse Process of the last Lumbar Vertebra ; from all the inner edge of the Spine of the Os Ilium; from the edge of that Bone, be- tween its anterior-superior Spinous Process and the A- cetabulum *, from most of the hollow part of the Os Ilium, and from an Aponeurosis covering it, (the Iliac Fascia), which is sent up from the Spine of the Bone and inner side of Poupart’s Ligament. It joins the Psoas Mag- nus, where it begins to become Tendinous on the Os Pubis. Insertion: Along with the Psoas Magnus. Action: To assist the Psoas in bending the Thigh.

no COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. A rough Surface at the outer and middle part of the Pone, for the insertion of the Pronator Radii Teres. ' The IcTiVer End of the Radiusy becoming gradually ' larger, and flat on its fore part, where it is covered by the Pronator Radii Quadratus. A Ridge upon the under and back part of the Radius, with a Fossa upon each side of it, where the Tendons of the Extensor Muscles of the Fingers pass. 'I’he outer side of this extremity of the Bone, hollorjaed i by the Extensors of the Thumb. A semilunar Cavity at the inner side of the under end of the Radius, lined with Cartilage, for receiving the corresponding extremity of the Ulna. 'i'he Icmer End of the Bone, formed into a Cavity of an oval or naviadar shape, and lined with Cartilage, for receiving the two first Bones of the Carpus. A small Transverse Ridge, frequently found in the middle of this Cavity, w’hich insinuates itself between the two first Bones of the Carpus. The under and outer part of the Radius, forming a Process somewliat similar to the Stvloid Process of the Ulna. From this Process a Ligament is sent to the Wrist. The Plead of the Radius is articulated with the outer j)art of the articular Surface of the Os Plumeri; the Radius is besides joined by a double articulation to the Ulna, for above, the head of the Radius is received into the small Semilunar Cavity of the Ulna, while the under end of the Ulna is received into the small Semiluuarjl Cavity of the Radius j in consequence of which connec-i tiun, the Radius accompanies the Ulna in the flexionji andiA

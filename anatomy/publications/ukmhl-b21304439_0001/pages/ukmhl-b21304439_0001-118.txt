102 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The by which it is rendered deeper, for receiving the Ball of the Os Humeri. Tile shape of that Cavity, resembling an Egg cut longitudinally, with the large end undermost, but so shallow as to receive only a small portion of the Ball of the Os Humeri, the rest of the Ball being contained . in liie Capsular Ligament. 'The SphiCy running across the Bone, dividing it into a small upper, and large under Surface, and giving ori- gin to part of the Spinati. The Spine, small .at its beginning, and becoming higher and broader in its course forwards. A triangular Spacey between the root of the Spine and Base of the Bone, where part of the Trapezius is fixed. Near the Base of the Spine, a passage for the princi- pal Vessels which supply the Substance of the Bone. The Fossa supra-spinatay or space above the Spine, for the origin of the .* upra-spinatus. 'Hie Fossa inj'ra-spinatay Iâ€™or the origin of the Infra- spinatus. The Spine becoming broad and flat, and terminating in a point at its anterior extremity, -where it is termed Acromiojiy or lop of the Shoulder. The under Surface of the Acromion, hollow for the passage of the Spinati. The Situation of the Acromion over the upper end of the Humerus, which, together with the Ligaments, con- tributes to the protection of the Joint. The anterior Edge of the Acromion, tipped with Carti- lage for its articulation with the outer end of the Clavicle.

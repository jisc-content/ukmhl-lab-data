9 Part I.] OF THE BONES. The outer Surface of this Membrane is connected to the surrounding parts by Cellular Substance. The inner Surface is more uniform than the outer, and its Fibres run, most frequently, in the same direction with those of the subjacent Bone. The inner ^art of the Periosteum is intimately con- nected to the surface of the Bones by short Fibres; and this connection is much stronger in the Child than in the Adult. Some of these Fibres may be considered as Ligamentous, but most of them are found by Injection to consist of Blood-vessels. The Periosteum, as well as other Membranes, must be supplied with Nerves; but these are too minute to be readily traced. The Sensibility of the Periosteum, like that of other Membranes, is by no means acute. In the inflamed state, its sensibility is vei'y considerable. The principal Uses of this Membrane are,—to trans- mit the Vessels which are spread out upon its surface into the Substance of the Bones;—to give attachment to Muscles ;—to prevent the effects of Friction between them and the Bones j—to assist in binding the latter to- gether ;—to assist in setting limits to the increase, and to check the overgrowth of Bones ;—and, in young per- sons, to strengthen the junction of the Bones with their Epiphyses, Cartilages, and Ligaments. 4 Membrana Meduixarir. This, improperly called Periosteum Internum, is an extremely fine Membrane, whicli lines the inside of tlie . Bones

3U. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartIII. . Ligaments of the Tarsus. The Capsular Lipamenty which joins the Articular Surface of the Os Calcis to that of the Astragalus. A number of Short Ligaments, lying in the Fossa of tlie AstragtUus and ol the Os Calcis, and forming the Ligamentous Apparatus of the Sinuous Cavity, which assists in fixing the two Bones strongly together. I’lie Capsular, the Broad Superior, and the Internal Lateral Ligaments, connecting the Astragalus, to the Os Navicnlare, and admitting of the lateral and rotatory motions of the Foot. The Superior, the Lateral, and ihe Inferior Ligaments, fixing the Os Calcis to the Os Cuboides, where a small dcgi’ee of motion is allowed to every side, llie inferior Ligaments consist of a Long, an Oblique, and a BJionv- hold Ligament, which are the longest and strongest of the Sole. The Superior Superficial, the Interosseous, and the In- ' ferior Transverse Ligaments, which fix the Os Navicu- Jare and Os Cuboides to each other. The Superior Lateral, and Plantar Ligaments, which fix the Os Naviculare to the Os Cuneiforme. The Supeiior Supeifcial, and the Plantar Ligaments, which connect the Os Cuboides to the Os Cuneiforme Externum. The Dorsal and Plantar Ligaments, which unite the Ossa Cuneiformia to each other. Besides the Capsular Ligaments of the Tarsus already mentioned, each of the other Joints of these Bones is furnished with its proper Capsular Ligament. From

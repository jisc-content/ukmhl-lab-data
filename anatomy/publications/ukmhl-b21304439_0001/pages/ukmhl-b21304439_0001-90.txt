71. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L the TJio tiao Inferior Oblique^ or Articulating Processes, also covered with Cartilage, and placed upon the under 2>art of the sides of the Arch. Tlie two Superior Oblique Processes of one Vertebra, articulated with the two Inferior Oblique of the Vertebra immediately above it. Round the edges of the Oblique Processes, rough Lines for the attachment of their articulating Liga- ments. The two Transverse Processes projecting from the sides of the Arch, and between the Oblique Processes. The Sphious Process, sent out from the back part of the Arch, which, being sharp and pointed, gives name to the whole chain of Bones. The Edges of this Process, as well as of the Arch, rough, where Ligaments come off which fix the corre- sponding parts of the contiguous Vertebi'ae together. The Substance of the Processes stronger, with a thicker external Plate than the Bodies of the Vertebrae. 'I'hc Vertebrae are joined to each other by a double Articulation ; their Bodies being connected by the In- tervertebral Substances already described; and their Oblique Processes are so connected by their Ligaments as to allow a small degree of motion to all sides. The uses of the true Vertebrae are, to give an erect posture to the Trunk of the Body; to allow a sufficient and secure motion to the Head, Neck, and Trunk; and to support and jn'otect the Bowels and other soft parts. In the Foetus, each Vertebra consists of three pieces connected by Cartilages, viz. the Body not fully ossified ; a curved Bone on each side, forming a small share of

0 3 ' by lOi 'Part I.]- ' OF THE BONES. The l)orstm, or outer Surface bf the Scapula, ren- dered convex in some parts, and concave in otliers, by the action of the Muscles which cover it. The body of the Scapula is remarhahly tMuy and, in an old person, transparent. The three Edges of the Bone thick and strongs and termed Costce. The superior or Cervical Costa the shortest of the three, and placed nearly opposite to the second Rib. A Semilunar Notch near the fore part of the superior Costa, for the passage of the superior Scapulary Ves- sels and Nerves. The inferior or anterior Costa, extending obliquely downwards and ..backwards," between the third and eighth Ribs. The posterior Costa, or Base of the Bone, placed ob- liquely with respect to the Spine, the upper end being considerably nearer to it than the under. The upper part of the Base, above the Spine, run- ning obliquely forwards to the upper angle, and giving attachment to the Levator Scapulte. The inferior Angle very acute, and marked by the passage of the Latissimus Dorsi, and the origin of the Teres Major. The superior Angle approaching a right Angle. The anterior Angle, forming the Cei'vix, whicli sup- ports the head of the Bone. The Glenoid Cavity, placed on the fore part of the Head of the Bone, and lined with Cartilage for the ar- ticulation of the Os Humeri. The Cartilage lining this Cavity thickest at the edges,

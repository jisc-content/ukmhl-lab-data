The Fossa for the Intercostal Vessels and Nerves wanting at the edge of this Rib. The Cartilages of the two under True Ribs, and three iiapper False Ribs, joined to each other by an union of SSubstance. The Head of the eleventh Rib, having no Tubercle for ’articulation, being only loosely joined to the Transverse [Process. Tlie twelfth Rib much shorter than the rest. Its Head is only joined to the twelfth Vertebra of the Back. It lihas no Tubercle, nor articulation with the Transverse IProcess ; neither has it any Fossa at its under edge, the Wessels and Nerves running some way below it. The Anterior Extremities of the eleventh and twelfth IRibs, not joined to each other, nor to any other Rib, tbut lying loose among the Muscles;—hence these Ribs ‘sometimes named Floating Ribs. The Substance of the Ribs, like that of the Vertebra?, iiis cellular, and only covered with a thin external Plate, iwhich becomes somewhat thicker towards the Verte- Ibrm. In the Foetus, the Heads and Tubercles of the Ribs lhave Cartilages, part of which become thin Epiphysjss. .After Birth, the Bodies of the Ribs encroach.gradually (on the Cartilages; hence the Cartilages of the Ribs are {proportionally shorter in Adults than in Children., The Ribs give form to the Thorax, coyer and defend 1 the Pleart and I.ungs, and assist the latter in perform- i ing respiration.

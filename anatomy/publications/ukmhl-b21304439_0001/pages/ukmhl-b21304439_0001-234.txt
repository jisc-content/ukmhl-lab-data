182 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PautD. the From the inside of the Crural Arch, and from the Spine of the Ilium, a Tendinous Aponeurosis, termed Iliac Fascia^ is sent off, which is reflected over the Ilia- cus Internus, and Psoas Magnus, which it braces and protects. It descends afterwards between the Psoas and External Iliac Vessels, to give a lining to the Bones, ISIuscles, and Ligaments, at the inner side of the Pelvis. It is firmly attached to the Linea Ilio-Pectinea, and be- hind the Origin of the Crural Vessels, is incorporated with the Pubal part of the Fascia Lata, in such a man- ner, that the one may in a great measure be considered as a continuation of the other. From the Crural Arch, from the Iliac Portion of the [.inca Ilio-Pectinea, and reflected also from the under part of the Expansion covering the Iliacus Internus, another Aponeurotic Expansion, the Fascia Transversa- lis of Mr Coopkr, is sent upwards, which lines the in- side of the Transversalis, lies between it and the Peri- toneum, and becomes gradually thinner in its ascent to- wards the upper part of the Abdomen. The Angle of reflection between these two Expan- sions being formed of strong Tendinous Fibres, the Abdomen at this place is fortified, and the Bowels are prevented from protruding between the Spine of the Ilium and Iliac Blood-Vessels, Besides these Expansions, others are mentioned by late Authors, as being sent down to inclose the Femoral V^essels at the upper part of the Thigh, so as to form what is called tlie Crural Sheath. The beginning of the Crural Sheath, or that part next the Cavity of the Pelvis, is formed anteriorly by

The Nasal Platey extending downwiirds and forwards from the Base of the Crista Galli, to form the upper and back part of the Septum Narium, or Partition of the Nostrils. The greater part of this Process is very thin, but to- wards its anterior and imder edge it becomes thinker, for its firmer junction with the Bones and middle Carti- lage of the Nose. It is frequently bent a little to one side; in such cases, the two Nostrils become unequal in size. The Ethmoid Cellsy of an indeterminate number and form, placed under the Cribriform Plate, a little to the outside of the Nasal Lamella, separated from each other by thin Partitions, and serving the same puiposes as the Frontal Sinuses.

In the Quadruped, this Bone is convoluted like a Turban, hence, in the human species, it is frequently called Turbinatum. Its Convexity towards the Septum, and Concavity outwards.

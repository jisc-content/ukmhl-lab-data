fs2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Sterno-Cleido-Mastoideus, vel Stcrno-Masfoideus. Origin: From the top of the Sternum, and the ante- rior end of the Clavicle, by two distinct Heads; the first of which is round, tendinous, and a little fleshy; the other is broad and fleshy. A little above the Clavicle, the two Heads unite to form a strong Muscle, which runs obliquely upwards and outwards ; the greater part of it being covered by the Platysma Myoides. Insertion: By a thick strong Tendon, into the Mas- toid Process, which it surrounds •, and becoming thin- ner, the Insertion extends as far back as the Lambdoid Suture. Action: To turn the Head to one side, and assist in rolling it. When both Muscles act, they bow the Head. MUCLES SITUATED BEnVEEN THE OS ITYOIDES AND TRUNK. Sterno-Hyoideus. Origin; From the edge of the upper Bone of the Sternum internally, and from the adjacent parts of the Clavicle and Cartilage of the first Rib *,—ascending upon the fore part of the Traebea and following Muscle.

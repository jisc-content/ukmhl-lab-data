U8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. which is implanted into the part to be moved, and which is commonly smaller than the Origin. The Division of a Muscle into Fleshy mid Tendinous Parts. The Fleshy part distinguished by being soft^ sensible^ generally of a red colour^—from the great quantity of Blood in it,—and possessing contractility. The Fleshy part, composed of a collection of Fibres, intermixed with Blood-vessels, Lymphatics, and Nerves, with some Cellular Substance and Fat. The Muscular Fibres consist chiefly of Fibrin^ with a small quantity of Gelatin, Albumen, and Saline Matter. The Division of Muscles into Rectilineal^ as in the Sartorius;—Simple Penniform^ as in the Peroneiis Lon- gus;—Complete Penyiiform, as in the Rectus Femoris;— Compound Penniform, as in the Fore paH of the Soletis ; —Radiated^ as in the Pectoralis Major;—Holloxa, as in the Hearty Intestines^ Bladder of Uriney Sfc. The partiadar Names of Muscles are taken from their shapey sizey situatioiiy directiony compositiony uscy and attachment. The Tendoiiy like the fleshy part of the Muscle, is of a fibrous nature, but is distinguished from the Flesh, by being generally smallery fiimery stronger —of a vdiite glistening coloury having no contractilityy and little or no sensibility in the sound state. From long boiling, it is observed to afford a large portion of Jelly, or Glue. Tendons have very few Blood-vesselsy and no evident Nerves. Tendons connect Muscles to Bones, and by the small- ness of their siae compared to the Belly of the Muscle, preserve

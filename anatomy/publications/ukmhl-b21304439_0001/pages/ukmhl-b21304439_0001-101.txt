: Part L] S5 OF THE BONES. -4 > Os Ilium. I The Os Ilhm, forming the upper part of the Os In- nominatum, and spreading out, to assist in supporting the contents of the Abdomen. The Ijarsuniy or outer convex Surface of the Bone, raised in some parts, and depressed in others, where the Glutei Muscles, or Extensors of the Thigh, have their origin. The Spine, or upper semicircular edge of the Bone, for the attachment of the Oblique and Transverse Ab- dominal Muscles. The anterior-superior Spinous Process, or anterior ex- tremity of the Spine, for the attachment of the Sarto- rius and of Poupart’s Ligament. The anterior-inferior Spinous Process, a little below the former, for the attachment of the Rectus Femoris. The tico posterior Spinous Processes, at the back part of the Spine, less considerable than the two anterior ; partly for the origin of Muscles, but chiefly for the at- tachment of Ligaments which belong to the Joint be- tween this Bone and the Os Sacrum. • 'Hie Notch of the Os Ilium under the posterior-infe- rior Spinous Process, for the passage of the Pyriform Muscle, the Sciatic Nerve, and Blood-vessels. 'fhe Venter, or inner concave Surface of the Bone, for the attachment of one of the Flexors of the Thigh, termed Iliacus Internm, and ,the support of a portion of the Intestinum Ilium and Colon.

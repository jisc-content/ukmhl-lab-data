lOS COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartI. The Older PaH of tlie Articular Surface, upon wliich the IJeatl of the Radius plays, of a round form, and considered by some Authors as the smooth part of the outer Condyle. Round the Edge of the Articular Cavity, the Bone marked by the insertion of the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. A small Cavity at the under and fore part of the Bone, above the Trochlea, for receiving the Coronoid Process of the L^lna in the Flexion of the Fore-arm. A large Cavity at the under and back part of the Bone, also above the Trochlea, the under part of it for receiving the Olecranon of the Ulna in the extension of the Fore-arm, and the upper part for containing the Fat of the .Joint. Between these cavities the Bone is pressed so thin as to become transparent, especially in an old person. The Substance and inner Structure of the Os Hu- meri is the same as in other long round Bones. The sides are compact, but the Cancelli are so large in the middle of the Bone, as to give the appearance of a hol- low Cylinder. The Ball of the Os Flumeri is articulated with the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula, which, from its super- ficial nature, and the long Ligaments inclosing the Joint, .allows the Arm to move in all directions; the Bone even performing a small degree of motion round its own axis. 'JThe extent of motion of the Arm, however, is conside- rably increased by the rolling of the Scapula. In the Foetus, the Extremities of the Bone are Car- tilaginous 5 and the Ball w'ith the Tubercles, and the Trochlea

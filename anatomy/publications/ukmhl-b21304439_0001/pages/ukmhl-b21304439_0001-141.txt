OF THE BONES. Paiit I.] The internal Condyle^ larger and deeper than the ex- ternal, to compensate for the obliquity of the Thigh, and to give less obliquity to the Leg. A Notch between the back part of the Condyles, for lodging the Popliteal Vessels and Nerves. A semilunar rough Notch, deeper and lower than the former one, for the attachment of the Crucial or inter- nal Ligaments of the Knee. The Thiffh-bone is articulated above with the Os In- O nominatum, which allows the free motion of the Body of the Bone in all directions. It is restrained, howevor, in its motions outwards by the Ligamentiim Rotundura, and by the high Brim of the Acetabulum. The Head and Neck of the Bone can move round their own axis, though its Body possesses little rotatory motion. In consequence of the oblique situation of the Head and Neck when the Ball rolls, the Body of the Bone is only brought forwards or backwards. In tlie Foetus, the different Processes of the Bone are Cartilaginous, and afterwards form large Epiphyses. The in7ier substance of this Bone, like that of other long Bones, consists of a fibrous reticular substance in the middle, and lamellated Cancelli at the extremities. The body of the Bone has remarkably thick and strong solid sides, but towards the ends these become almost as thin as a piece of paper. LEG,

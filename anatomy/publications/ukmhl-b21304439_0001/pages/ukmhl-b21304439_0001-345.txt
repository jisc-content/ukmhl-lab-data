293 t Paht III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. is fixed along the outer edge of the Ligament, which it increases in breadtli. The Inferior or Falciform Appendix is situated within the Cavity of the Pelvis; the back part of it is connect- ed with the middle of the lai-ge External Ligament, and the remainder is extended round the Curvature of the Os Ischium. These two Productions assist the large Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament in furnishing a more commodious situation for, and attachment to, part of the Gluteus Maxinuts and Obturator Internus Muscles. Besides the Ilio-Sacral and Sacro-Ischiatic Ligaments, several other Slips are observed upon the back of the Os Sacrum, which descend in an irregular manner, and strengthen the connection between that Bone and the Ossa Ilia. r The large Holes upon the back part of the Os Sa- crum are also surrounded with various Ligamentous Ex- pansions projecting from one Tubercle to another, and giving Origin to Muscular Fibres, and protection to small Vessels and Nerves which creep under them. A Geno al Covering sent down from the Ligaments of the Os Sacrum, which spreads over and connects the different pieces of the Os Coccygis together, allowing considerable motion, as alreadyâ€™ mentioned in the de- scription of this Bone. Longihidinal Ligaments of the Os Coccygis, which de- scend from those upon the Dorsum of the Os Sacrum, to be fixed to the back part of the Os Coccygis. The Ligaments of this Bone prevent it from being pulled too much forwards by the action of the Cuccygeus, and T 3 they

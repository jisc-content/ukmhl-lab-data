OF THE BONES. Part L] 15 long Bones, are considerably shorter than the Exterior, because they pass gradually inwards to form the Can- celii, while the exterior parts are continued to the ex- tremities of the Bones. The Ossification of spherical-shaped Bones, as in the ^Vrist, begins by one Nucleus, and that of irregular- formed Bones, as in the Vertebra?, by different Nuclei; and both of these sets of Bones have their origin in Cartilage. All the Epiphyses, likewise, have their original for- mation in Cartilage. The Ossification which begins in Cartilage is consi- derably later than that which has its origin between Membranes, and this is at very different times in diffe- rent parts of the Body. When Ossification is about to begin in a particular Cartilage, and which is most frequently in the centre, the Arteries, which were formerly transparent, become dilated, and receive the red Blood from which the Os- seous Matter is secreted. This Matter retains, for some time, the form of the Vessels which give it origin, till, more Arteries being by degrees dilated, and more Os- seous Matter deposited, the Bone at length attains its complete form. ^ Some Bones are completely formed at the time of Birth, as the small Bones of the Ear. The generality of Bones are incomplete until the age of puberty, or between the fifteenth and twentieth year, and in some few instances not until a later period. In Children, the greater number of parts in Bones are Epiphyses or Appendices^ which, in Adults, become Apophyses or Processes. < Tlie

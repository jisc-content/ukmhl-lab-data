13S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The A Hidge above, and a Jlat Surface at each side of their bodies, for tlie origin of the Interossei Muscles. Tliefiat Surfaces turned obliquely outwards, and the obliquity increasing the more externally the Bones are placed. The anterior Extremities ^oxinmg Balls, to be articu- lated with the Toes;â€”the Balls much longer from above downwards, than IVom one side to the other. Hound the Heads distinct imjiressions, where the Capsular Ligaments are fixed. The Metatarsal Bones of the Great Toe, by much the thickest and strongest, but shortest of the Metatarsus. Tlie articulating Cavity of its Base, deeper than the rest. The anterior Extremity, bearing a greater proportion to the Base than the rest, having a much larger share of the weight of the Body to sustain here, and formed into a middle Prominence, with ivco lateral Depressions, where the Bones termed Ossa Sesamoidea move. The Metatarsal Bone of the Second Toe, the longest of the five. The Metatarsal Bone of the Middle Toe, the second in length, with a Base like that of the fonner Bone, triangular, but a little larger, to be articulated with the Os Cuneiforme Externum. The Metatarsal Bone of the Fourth Toe, nearly of the same length as the former, but distinguished from it by its Base being thicker below, and its Cartilaginous Surface being more of a square form, corresponding with the anterior and inner part of the Os Cuhoides, with which it is articulated.

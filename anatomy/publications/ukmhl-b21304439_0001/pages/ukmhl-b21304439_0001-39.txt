I'he Bones of the Cranium are composed of two Tables, which at the upper part are nearly parallel to each other. The two Tables have intermediate Cancelli, termed here Diploe, though nearly of the same nature with the Cancelli in other flat Bones. Tlie External Table of the Cranium is somewhat thicker than the Internal^ which, from its thinness and consequent brittleness, is called Vitrea. The Diploe, or Cancelliy between the Tables, are more regular between the Bones of the upper than of the under part of the Cranium, where, in several of the hard Bones, they are not observable. In the Skulls of old Subjects, the Diploe are often so obliterated, that scarcely any vestige of them can be t seen. In certain diseased Bones, the Diploe are of great thickness, while the Tables of the Skull are thin like paper. . The Cranium is genei-aLâ€™y composed of eight Bones; six of which are said to be proper to the Cranium, and two common to it and the Face. The six proper to the Cranium are, The Os Frontisy placed in the fore part of the Cra- nium. The /uo Ossa Parietaliay placed in the upper and la- teral parts of the Cranium.

COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. to many of the Muscular Fibres which lie immediately under it. Biceps Flexor Cubiti, vel Biceps^ vel Scapulo-Radialis. Origin: By two Heads: The outer one, called its Lo7ig Heady begins by a slender Tendon from the upper edge of the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula, passes over the Ball of the Os Flumeri within the Joint, and, ini its descent without the Joint, is inclosed in a Groove upon tlie upper and fore part of the Bone, by a Ligament which proceeds from the Capsular Ligament and adja- cent Tendons : The inner one, called its Short Head, arises. Tendinous and Fleshy, from the Coracoid Pro- cess of the Scapula, in common witli the Coraco-Bra- chialis. A little below the middle of the fore part of the Os Humeri, the two Heads unite, and form a thick Fleshy Belly. Insertion: By a strong roundish Tendon, into the Tubercle at the upper and inner part of the Radius, and by a Tendinous Expansion into the Aponeurosis of the Fore-Arm, which it likewise assists in forming. Action : To bend the Fore-Arm, and to assist the Su- pinator Muscles in rolling the Radius outwards, and, of course, to turn the Palm of the Hand upwards^^ Brachialis Internus, vel Humet'o-Cubitalis^ Origin: Fleshy, from the middle of the Os Humeri, at each side of the Deltoides, covering all, and attaclietl to most, of the under and fore part of the Bone.

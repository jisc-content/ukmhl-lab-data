PartIII.T OF'THEXIGA]VreOTS,'&c. ' 311 I.IGAMEXTS The i-Jco Inter-articular Cartilages, called Semilunar from their shape like a Crescent, placed upon the top- of the Tibia. The outer convex edge of each of these Cartilages is Â» thick, while the inner concave edge becomes thin and sharp like a knife or sickle,'and being concave above, the iSockets for the Condyles of tlie Os Femoris are ren- dered deeper, and this Bone and the Tibia are more accurately adapted to each other. ^ Each of these Cartilages is broad in the middle, their extremities becoming narrower and thinner as they ap- proach one another. Each covers about two-thirds of the Superficial Cavity of the top of the Tibia, leaving one third bare in the middle. The extremities are termed Cornua, and are fixed by Ligaments to the Protuberance of the Tibia. The anterior Cornua are joined to each other by a Transverse Ligament. The convex edge of these Cartilages is fixed to the Capsular and other Ligaments, in such a manner as to allow them to play a little upon the Cartilaginous Sur- face of the Tibia, by which the motions of that Bone upon the Condyles of the Os Femoris are facilitated. The Mucous or Fatty Substances of this Joint, which are the largest of any in the Body, are situated in the different interstices of the Joint, but chiefly round the edges of the Patella. They are covei'ed by a fine Mem- brane reflected from the inner Surface of the Capsular Ligament. - 1 Fimbria project from the edges of these Fatty Sub- stances, which discharge Synovia for the lubrication of the Joint. . c.;..

FPAiir li;]’ OF THE MUSCLES;' " m' The whole of this Fascia is frequently so thin, as to. ■lappear. little else than Cellular Substance condensed; Iln the inflamed state, however, it sometimes becomes . rremarkably thick. It forms the Outer, or Superficial IFascia, in Inguinal and Crural Herniae. . Lbider the Superficial Fascia, on the Thigh, there is :ia thick and strong Aponeurosis, which arises from the ffore part of the Spine of the Ilium, from the whole iunder edge of the Crural Arch, and from the upper and ffore part of the Os Pubis. This forms part of the Fas- icia Lata Femoi'iSf (to be afterwards taken .notice of), 1 which incloses the Muscles upon the Thigh. The portion arising from the Ilium and Crural Arch i is termed Ilial, and that from the Pubis, Puhal 'portion (of the Fascia Lata. The Ilial and Pubal portions form I a considerable Angle at the inner side of the Femoral ’.Vessels, and between the Muscles on the fore and those I on the inner side of the Thigh. The upper and inner part of the Ilial Portion, forms a Semilunar Edge^ described by Mr Burns, in.;.the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal for 1806, un- der the name of Falciform Process, which leaves a large opening, where the Vena Saphena Major, ascending upon the Pubal Portion of the Fascia Lata, terminates in the Femoral Vein. At the edge of the Falciform Process, a Gland is commonly placed, and sometimes two, through whicli part of the Superficial Lymphatics of the Thigh pass ’in their course towards the Abdomen. At this part of the Thigh, the portion of the Bowels passing through the Crural Ring, protrudes in Femoral Hernia. M2 Frequently

129 Part L] OF THE BONES. nallyj Tor the insertion of the Biceps Flexor Cruris, and of the external lateral Ligament of the Knee. The Body of the Bone bent a little inwards and back- wards, and unequally triangular, with the surfaces be- 1 tween the Angles marked by the Muscles which arise 1 from it, or are placed upon it. A Ridge at the inner side of the Fibula, opposed to ( one at the outer part of the Tibia, for the insertion of 1 the Interosseous Ligament. A Canal on the back part of the Bone, slanting "ob- ' liquely downwards, a little above its middle, for the pas- ssage of the Medullary Vessels. The tmder End of the Fibula, broad and Jlat^ to be i received by the semilunar Cavity of the Tibia. The under end of the Bone forming the Malleolus iEitemus, or outer Ankle, which is lower and farther I back than the inner Ankle, the obliquity of the two iMalleoli in some measure corresponding with the obli- cquity of the Foot. A convex smooth Surface on the inner side of the Mai- ' lleolus Externus, opposed to the outer side of the Astra- jgalus, which moves upon it. ^ The Coronoicl, Process, sent down from the Malleolus lExternus, from which Ligaments go to the Bones at uhe outer side of the Foot. A Furro-ii} upon the back part of the Malleolus Ex- tternus, for lodging the Tendons of the Peronei. The Fibula being articulated with the Tibia at its su- .perior extremity by almost plain surfaces, and tied to it by strong and short Ligaments, only a very little mo- ition is allowed. At the under end it is joined so firmly by strong Li- VoL.I. I gamnets, '

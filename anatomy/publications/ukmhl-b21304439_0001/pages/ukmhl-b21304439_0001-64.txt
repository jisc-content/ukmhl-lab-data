4S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. I’terygoid Plates, giving rise to the internal Pterygoid jMuscIo. A small Depressio7i at the back part of the root of the internal Pterygoid Plate, which gives origin to part of the Circumflex Muscle of the Palate. A Groove on each side, which extends at the inner jtart of the Bone, between the root of the Styloid Pro- cess and tliat of the internal Pterygoid Plate, assisting in the formation of the Eustachian Tube. The two Triangtdar Processes., which adhere to the under part of the Sphenoid, and to the Ethmoid Bone, and which are considered as two of the Bones of the Face. The Processus Azygos, standing single, and forming a sharp ridge which projects from under the middle and fore part of the Bone. 'I’he Clinoid Pt'oeesses, seen on the inside of the Bone, compared to the supporters of a Bed, of which them arc, Ttco Anterior, projecting from the fore part of tlie Body of the Bone, and extending horizontally outwards j each terminating in a point which obtains the name of Transverse Spinous Process ; and. One Posterior, situated transversely, some way behind file anterior Processes, and frequently ending in two Knobs, which incline obliquely forwards. Sometimes one or both of the anterior Clinoid Pro- cesses are united with the posterior, forming an Arch over the internal Carotid Artery. The Processus Olivan's, considered by some as a fourth Clinoid

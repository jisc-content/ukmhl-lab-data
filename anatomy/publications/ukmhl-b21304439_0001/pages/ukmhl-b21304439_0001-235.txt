Part IL] 18S OF THE MUSCLES. M 1’ The the Fascia Transversalis, Crural Arch, and Cellular Sub- stance blended together, posteriorly by the conjoined Fascia Iliaca, Pubal part of the Fascia Lata, and Cel- lular Substance. The anterior and posterior portions of the Fascia uniting together at the sides of the Blood- vessels, form the lateral parts of the Sheath. Lower than the Crural Arch, and extending as far as the Perforation in the Tendon of the Great Adductor Muscle of the Thigh, the Artery is covered before by the Fascia Lata, behind by the deep part, or Pubal portion of that Fascia, and laterally by the two Fasciae conjoined by Cellular Substance. The Sheath and Vessels it incloses, at the upper part of the Thigh, with the External Iliac Vessels also at the inner part of the Pelvis, are strengthened by some Ten- dinous slips, which run between, and also at the sides of the Vessels •, uniting them together, to the Crural Arch before, and to the Bones behind, over which they pass. Within the Fascim the Vessels are closely connected together, as the Great Vessels in the Neck are, by a Vagina of Cellular Substance condensed, and which may be considered as the propei' S/iealh of the Great Vessels situated in the Thigh. Between the inner part of the External Iliac Vein, and the insertion of the under column of Poupart’s Ligament into the Os Pubis, and having the Os Pubis behind covered by its Ligament, a triangular space is left, at the outer part of which there is a small aperture, which forms the Crural Foramen of Gimbernat. The triangular Cavity and Aperture are more considerable in the Female than in the Male. Through thisvFora- mpn the Bowels protrude in Femoral Hernia.

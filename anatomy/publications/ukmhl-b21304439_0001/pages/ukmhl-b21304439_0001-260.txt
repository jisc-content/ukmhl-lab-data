tJ08 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Transverse Processes of the fourtli, fifth, and sixth Cer- vical Vertebra?, by three distinct Tendons. It turns the Neck obliquely backward and to one side. Lonoissimus Dorsi, vel Sacro-Spinalis. Origin: In common with the Sacro-Lumbalis. It forms a large, thick, and strong Muscle, which fills the Hollow between the Spine and Angles of the Ribs; be- coming gi-adually smaller in its ascent. Insertion: Into the Transverse Processes of all the Dorsal Vertebra?, chiefly by small double Tendons; and, by a Tendinous and Fleshy Slip, into the lower edge of each of the Ribs, excepting the two Inferior, near their Tubercles. Action: Iâ€™o extend the Trunk, and keep it erect; the outer part may assist in depressing the Ribs during laborious Expiration. From the upper part of tliis Muscle, a round Fleshy Slip runs up to join the Cervicalis Descendens. Spinalis Dorsi. Origin: By five Tendinous Slips, from the Spinous Processes of the two upper Lumbar, and the three lower Dorsal Vertebrae. In its ascent, it is incorporated with the Longissimus Dorsi. Insertion: Into the Spinous Processes of the eight or nine uppermost Dorsal Vertebra?, excepting the first, by as many Tendons. Action:

The upper end of the Radius^ covered with Cartilage, Â»and formed into a circular head, which is hollowed jtobove, for receiving the outer part of the Articular Siir- fiace of the Os Humeri. * The inner Side of the Head smooth, and also covered rwith Cartilage, where it plays in the small Semilunar LCavity at the outer side of the Ulna. The Cei-vix of the Radius smaller than the Head ; in ;lthc Subject, surrounded by a circular Ligament, which kkeejis the Bone in its place, and allows it to roll upon lithe Ulna. The lubercle of the Radius, at the under and inner upart of the Cervix, for the insertion of the Biceps Flexor tCubiti. The Bodp of the Bone larger than that of the Ulna, convex on its outer and back part, and rounded by tlie ^Muscles which cover it. The Surfaces next the Ulna fat^ where Muscles of i.the Hand take their origin. The anter ior imd posteriot' Surfaces, terminating next : the Ulna, in a sharp Ridge, to which tlie Interosseous ILigament of the Fore-arm is fixed.

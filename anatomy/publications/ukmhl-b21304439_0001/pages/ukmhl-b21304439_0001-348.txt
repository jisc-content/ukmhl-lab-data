The Ligaments which join the posterior extremity of the Clavicle to the Acromion, having a Capsular IJga- ment within, and sometimes an Interarticular Cartilage. The Ligamentvm Conoideum^ which arises from the root of the Coracoid Process, and is fixed to the Tu- bercle at the outer end of the Clavicle. The Jjigamenlum Trapezoidmmy which arises from the point of the Coracoid Process, and is fixed to the under edge of the Clavicle. A thin Ligamentous Slip which comes from the Ten- don of the JSubclavius, or from the Clavicle, and joins the Trapezoid Ligament. The Ligaments fixing the Clavicle to the Scapula are of such strength, as to allow only a small degree of mo- tion, and that chidly of a rolling or twisting nature. I>igawi:kts to the Scapula. file Frojicr Anterior Triangidur Ligament of the Sca- pula, which arises broad from the External Surface of the Coracoid Process, and becomes narrower where it is fixed to the posterior Margin of the Acromion. This Ligament forms one continued Surface. It is thickest, however, on each side, and these thicker parts are united by a thin intermediate Ligamentous Mem- brane, which, when removed, gives to the Ligament the appearance of being double.â€”It confines the Ten- don of the Supra-Spinatus, and assists in protecting tlie upper and iiiiier part of the Joint of the Humerus.

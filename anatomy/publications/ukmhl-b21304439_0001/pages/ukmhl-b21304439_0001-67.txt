Part I.] OF THE BONES. 51 The 1) 2 The Foramina Pterygoidea are the smallest of the Sphenoid Holes, and cannot be distinctly seen in tlie entire Skull. Sometimes one or more small passages are observed in or near the Sella Turcica, for the transmission of Blood-vessels into the Sphenoid Sinuses, or to the sub- stance of the Bone. Tlie Foramina Lacera Anterioray common to tlie points of the Partes Petrosae and the Sphenoid Bone. In a recent Skull, each of these Floles is filled behind with a thin Plate of Bone, which covert the internal Carotid Arter}^, and farther forwards, with a Cartilagi- nous Ligament, which lies over the Eustachian Tube, both of which drop out by maceration. The Sphenoid SinuseSy occupying the whole of the Body of the Bone, at the under and fore part of the Â« Sella Turcica, answering the same purposes with the Ethmoid and Frontal Cells. A complete Partition between the right and left Sphe- noid Sinuses. A Passage from the upper and fore part of each of the Sphenoid Sinuses, descending, in a slanting direc- tion, into the superior-posterior parts of the Nose. The two Sinuses are frequently of unequal size, and sometimes there is but one lai'ge Cavity, widi an open- ing into one of the Nostrils. In some Subjects, instead of Sinuses, the Body of the Bone is composed of large Cells. The Substance of this Bone is the most unequal of any in the Body, some parts being extremely thin, while others are thicker than'most parts of the Cranium.

OF THE BONES. 37 Part LJ The C 3 I The jFosste at the sides of the upper Limb, for con- taining the posterior Lobes of the Cerebrum. The Fossce at the sides of the lower Limb, i’or con- taining the Cerebellum. Anterior to the Fossae for lodging the Cerebellum, /•wo Cavities for receiving the lateral Sinuses, previous to their leaving the Cavity of the Cranium. The concave Surface of the Cuneiform Process, for receiving the Medulla Oblongata and Basilar Artery. The depressions at each side of the Cuneiform Pro- cess, wliere the inferior Petrosal Sinuses are placed. The Foramen Magnum^ behind the Basilar Process, and between the Condyles, for the passage of the Mc- dnlla Oblongata, Vertebral Blood-Vessels, and Acces- sory Nerves. The superior or antei ior Condyloid Foramina^ at the sides of the Foramen Magnum, and immediately over the Condyles, for the passage of the Ninth Pair of Nerves. 'The postei'ior Condyloid Foraminay at the back part of the root of the Condyles, for the passage of Veins from the Occiput, or from the Vertebral Veins, into the lateral Sinuses, near their terminations. Frequently one of the posterior Condyloid Foramina is wanting; sometimes both, when the Veins pass through the Foramen Magnum. Besides the Holes above taken notice of, others are olten found, near the edges of the Bone, for the trans- mission of Veins, the number and size of which are uncertain.

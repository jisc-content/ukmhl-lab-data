loo COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part 1. The rJie under Surface hollow^ for Iwlging a portion of the Subclavius. In the under Surface, one or more small Canals, leading obliquely outwards, for the passage of the Me- dullary Vessels. The External, or Scapulary Extremity, tipped with Cartilage, to be articulated with the Acromion of the Scapula. Near the back part of the Scapulary Extremity, a Tubercle, for the attachment of a strong Ligament, which connects this Bone to the Coracoid Process of the Scapula. The Substance of this Bone is like that of other Ions round Bones, but the external Table is of considerable thickness and strength. The Clavicle supports the Shoulder at a proper dis- tance from the Thorax, and thereby renders the motions of the Arm more extensive. It gives origin to several Muscles, and defence to large Vessels and Nerves. In a Foetus, the Clavicle is completely formed. ScAruLA. The Situation of the Scapula, upon the upper and back part of the Thorax, at some distance from the Ribs, the interval being filled up by a cushion of Flesh. The shape of the Scapula triangtilar, with one of the angles placed downwards. The Venter, or inner Surface, concave, corresponding with the convexity of the Ribs, and marked with Bidges and Depressions by the Subscapularis.

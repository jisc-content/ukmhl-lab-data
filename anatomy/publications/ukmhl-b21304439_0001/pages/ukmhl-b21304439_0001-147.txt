Part L] OF THE BONES. 151 by a rough Line., into \thich the Capsular Ligament of the Joint is fixed. Tlie Base, or upper part of the Bone, horizontal, and marked by the insertion of the Tendons of the Extensors of the Leg. The back part of the Apex, rough and depressed, for the attachment of the Ligament wliicli passes from the Patella to the Tubercle of the Tibia. , Tlie Ligaments of the Patella allow it to be moved upwards and downwards ; and when the Leg is extend- ed, they admit of its motion to either side, or to be rolled. When the Leg is extended, the Patella is lodged in the Trochlea of the Os Femoris; when the Limb is bent, the Patella is pulled down by the Tibia, and lodged in a hollow at the fore part of the Knee. The Patella has a thin, though firm external Table. Its internal Substance is cellular, but the Cells are small, . and have so much Osseous Matter employed in their I formation, as to give.the Bone a considerable degree of â€˜ strength. The structure of this Bone, the toughness of the Li- ! gaments which cover it, and the free motion it is aliow- (ed, are found to enable it better to resist any common 1 force applied to it, than if it had been a process con- ttinned from the Tibia, as the Olecranon is from the I Ulna. The Patella defends the fore part of the Knee, and s serves as a pulley or lever^Ty enabling the Muscles : fixed to it to act with greater advantage in extending t the Leg. 12 It

OF THE BONES. 73 I Part L] I The Intervertebral Substances^ of a Carlilago-I.iga~ meiitaus nature^ placed between the Bodies of tlie Ver- tebi'je, for fixing them together, and allowing the Spine to be moved in all directions. 'I'he Intervertebral Substances, composed of Co7icen^ trie Lamellccy with their edges firmly fixed to the Bodies of the Vertebrae. The Lamellae of these Substances, formed of Oblique Fibres^ which decussate each other, and are very com- pressible. The Centre oi these Substances changes from Lamellccy and puts on the appearance of a Mucus or Ptdp^ which has little compressibility, and serves as a pivot upon which the other parts of the Ligament can move with such gradual yielding as to lessen shocks in the Spine in violent motions of the Body. The Inieivei'tcbral Substances^ like the Vertebrae them- selves, larger and thicker as they descend, to give more security to the parts they support. An Arch sent out from the back part of the Body of each Vertebra, which, together with the Body, forms a large Hole^ which is part of the Canal, for the passage of the Spinal Marrow. A Notch at the'upper and under edges of each side of the Arch, forming, in the contiguous Vertebra?, the passage of the Spinal Nerves. The Processes of each Vertebra, seven in number, viz. two Superior Oblique, two Inferior Oblique, two Transverse, and one Spinous. The tino Superi&r Oblique^ or Articulating Processes^ covered with Cartilage, placed upon the upper part of the sides of the Arch. , The i '

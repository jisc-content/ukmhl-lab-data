Part I.] OF THE BONES. '8» F 2 derive Thejirst or uppermost'piece the largest, with Shoulders reaching farther than the end of the Os Sacrum. This is regarded by some as a proper distinction between the Os Coccygis and Os Sacrum. From the back part of the Shoulders, two Cornua frequently ascend to join the forked* Spinous Processes at the end of the Os Sacrum, and form a passage for the transmission of the last Pair of Spinal Nerves. The three lower Bones of the Os Coccygis becoming gradually smaller, the fourth terminating in a rough point. Cartilage is interposed between the different pieces of this Bone in young Subjects, joining them together, after tlie manner of the Vertebr®; allowing motion upon each other forwards and backwards, but chiefly between the first and second pieces; and a-greater de- gree of motion there in the Female than in the Male. In advanced life, but earlier in Men than in Women, the pieces grow together so as to admit of no motion ; but this takes place much later between the first and se- cond, than between the other pieces. The Substance, like that of the Os Sacrum, is spongy, but this Bone differs from the Sacrum in having no pas- sage for the Spinal Marrow, nor Holes for Spinal Nerves. The Connection of this Bone, in young Subjects, to the Os Sacrum, by Cartilage,—in old People, by an union of Substance. The Surface of the Bone is covered by a strong Li- gament, which adds to its strength; and its sides give rise to numerous Muscular Fibres, which, while they

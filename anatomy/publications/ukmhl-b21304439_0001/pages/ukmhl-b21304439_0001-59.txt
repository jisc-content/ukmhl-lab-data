Part I.] ' 43 OF THE BONES; the Seventh Pair of Nerves. The others are the Pas-' sages of the Branches of the Portio Mollis of that Nerve. Someway below the Meatus Internus, is the opening of the passage termed, by Cotunnius, Aquaductus Cocli- lece; and near the same distance behind the Meatus,. and on the same side of the Bone, is the mouth of the Aquaeductus Vestibuli. The Foramen Innominatum^ near the middle of the Anterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, and leading back- wards for the passage of the Vidian Nerve, which is re- flected from the Second Branch of the Fifth, to the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Orifice of the Canalis Caroticus appearing at the under part of the point of the Pars Petrosa. The Foramen Lacerum Posterkes, or Hole common to the Pars Petrosa and Cuneiform Process of the Occipi- tal Bone, for the passage of the Lateral Sinus, the Eighth Pair, and Accessory Nerves. The Nerves pass through the fore part of the Hole, and are separated from the Sinus by a Process of the Dura Mater, stretched be- tween two small Processes of these Bones. In some Skulls, an Osseous Partition separates the Nerves from the Sinus. The Connection of the Bone, at its upper curved Edge, to the Parietal Bone by the Squamous Suture. To the under and back part of the Parietal Bone, by the Additamentum Suturae Squamosa?. To the Occipital Bone, by the Additamentum Suturae Lambdoidalis. The Squamous part of the Temporal Bone is thin, .but equal,

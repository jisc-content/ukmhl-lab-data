OF THE BONES. Part I.] 135 I 4 The and to several Muscles of the Sole ; and before the Pro- minences, the Bone concavey where it lodges part of these Muscles. The anterior Surface concavey and somewhat in form of a pulley placed obliquely, for its articulation with the Os Cuboides. The Os Calcis is articulated with the Astragalus by Ligaments of such strength, that this part of the Foot, upon which the Body rests, is rendered firm and secure, but enjoys very little motion. In the FcEtus, a large proportion of this Bone is os- sified, and the Projection forming the Heel is afterwards an Epiphysis. The Os Naviculare, situated at the fore part of the Astragalus, and inner part of the Foot. Tlie posterior Sxirfaccy forming a Cavity somewhat like that of a Boat, for receiving the Head of the As- tragalus in the manner of Ball and Socket. A Prominence at the inner side of the Bone, for the insertion of Tendons, Muscles, and strong Ligaments, particularly for the Ligament stretched between this Bone and the Os Calcis,- for the support of the Astra- galus. fore part of the Bone conveXy and divided into three articular Suifacesy for the articulation with the Ossa Cuneiformia. Between the Os Naviculare and Astragalus, the Foot has its principal lateral and rotatory motions, though each of the other Joints of the Tarsus contributes a little:

Part 1.] OF THE BONES. 8i T^heposterior Cavity, rough and irregular; and in I the recent Subject, full of Ligamentous Fibres and Cel- i Ildar Substanccy which are included in the general Cap- ! sular Ligament, and which also assist in fixing the two Bones to each other. The Spinous Processes: The three uppermost com- j monly distincty but remarkably short: There is a great 1 variety, however, in the number and appearance of I the Spinous Processes in different Bones, and conse- ( quently of the length of the complete part of the Spi- 1 nous Canal. Four Pair of large Holes on the anterior Surface of I the Bone, at the end of the Lines already described, j and Grooves running out from the Holes, for the pas- s saffe of the Sacral Nerves. O Four Pair of Holes on the posterior Surfacsy not much 5 smaller than those seen anteriorly; but so filled with < Cellular Substance, and. covered with Membranes in the 1 recent Body, as only to admit small Nerves to pass out t to the Muscles on the back part of the Pelvis, and mi- I nute Arteries to enter to the Cauda Equina. A Notch at the under end of each side of the Bone, »or a Hole common to it and the Os Coccygis, for the j passage of the last Spinal Nerve. The Substance of the Os Sacrum, like that of the (other Vertebrae, is very spongyy and covered only by a t thin external Plate j this, however, is rendered consi- c derably stronger • by a Ligamentous Membrane which a adheres to it. The Connection of this Bone above to the last Lum- Ibar Vertebra, in the same manner as the other Verte- V OL. I. , F bras

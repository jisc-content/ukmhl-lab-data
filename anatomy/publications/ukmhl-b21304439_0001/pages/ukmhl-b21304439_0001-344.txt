592 COMPENDIUM or ANATOMY. [Part111. A Ligainejilous and Cellular Substance^ containing Mucus, which forms the back part of this Joint, also assisting to fix the two Bones to each other, in such a manner .os to allow no motion; the Joint, howeveiâ€™, along with its fellow, and that between the Ossa Pubis, being useful in diminishing the cfiects which might re- sult from Concussion. Tlie two Sacro-Ischiatic Ligaments, situated in the un- dfcr and back part of the Pelvis. They arise in common from the Transverse Processes of the Os Sacrum, from the under and lateral part of that Bone, and from the upper part of the Os Coccygis. 'Phe first, called the Large, External, or Posterior Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament, descends obliquely, to be fixed to the Tuberosity of the Os Ischium. The other, called the Small, Internal, or Anterior Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament, runs transversely to be fixed to the Spinous Process of the Os Ischium. These tw'o Ligaments assist in binding the Bones of the Pelvis, in supporting its contents, and in giving Origin to part of its Muscles. By the External, the Notch of the Ilium is formed into a Hole for the passage of the Py riform Muscle, the Sciatic Nerve, and the Blood- 1 vessels \vhich belong to the outside of the Pelvis. Be- tween the Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments, an Opening is left for the passage of the Obturator Intcrnus. The two Membranous Productions which are connect- ed with the large Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament, termed by Weitbrecht the Superior and Inferior Appendices ol the large Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament. The Supericn' Appendix, which is Tendinous, arises from the back part of the Spine of the Os Ilium, and is

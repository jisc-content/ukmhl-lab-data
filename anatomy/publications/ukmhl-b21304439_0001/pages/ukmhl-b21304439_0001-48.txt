32 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The upper Edge, longest- 'J'he anterior Edge, next in length. The posterior Edge, shorter. The inferior^ shortest, and in form of a ragged arcli, to be connected to the upper rounded edge of the Squa- mous part of the Temporal Bone. The three Jirst Edges of the Bone raggedy where they assist in forming the true Sutures. The corners of the Bone obtuse, excepting the under anterior, which forms a kind of process. The external surface of the Bone, smooth and convex. The Transverse arched Ridge, or Lme, frequently of a whiter colour than the rest of the Bone, placed ex- ternally a little below its middle height, for the origin of the Temporal Muscle. The radiated Furrows at the under part of the Bone, formed by the Fibres of the Temporal Muscle. Near the semicircular edge, many inequalities, which join similar inequalities on the inside of the Temporal Bone, to form the Squamous Suture. 'I'he Foramen Parietale, near the upper and back jiart of the Bone, for the transmission of a Vein from the Integuments of the Head to the superior longitu- dinal Sinus *, and sometimes of a small Brand yfrom the Temporal or the Occipital Artery, to the Falx of the Dura Mater. In several Skulls, one of the Parietal Holes is want- ing â€¢, in some, two are found in one side; in others, none in eitlier. 'Fhe internal concave Surface of the Bone. The Fnrrovcs made by the Blood-Vessels of the Dura Mater;

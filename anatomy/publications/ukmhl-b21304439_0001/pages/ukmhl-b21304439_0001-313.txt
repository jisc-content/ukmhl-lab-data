Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 261 I The Tendon of the Little Toe is frequently want- ing. Flexor Longus Digitorum, Vel Flexor Profundus, vel Perforans, vel Tibio- Phalavgeiis Communis. Origin: By an acute Tendon, which soon becomes Fleshy, from the back part of the Tibia, at the under edge of the Popliteus j and this beginning is continued down the inner edge of the Bone, by short Fleshy Fi- bres ending in its Tendon. It arises also by Tendinous and Fleshy Fibres, from the outer edge of the Tibia ; and between this double order of Fibres the Tibialis Posticus lies inclosed. Having gone under two Annu- lar Ligaments, it passes through a Sinuosity at the in- side of the Os Calcis; and about the middle of the Sole, receives a Tendon from the Flexor Longus Polli- cis. It then divides into four Tendons which run through the Slits of the Perforatus. Insei'tion: Into the Base of the third Phalanx of the four smaller Toes ; the Tendons of this, as well as of the Flexor Brevis, being inclosed upon the Toes by . Annular Ligaments. Action: To bend the different Joints of the Toes, particularly the last one. 1 1 113 Flexor » 1 ! i < « I

300 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. sliarp Ridges of the Radius and Ulna, filling up the greater part of the space between tliese two Bones. It is broadest in the middle, in consequence of the Bopes here being largest at their extremities, and is composed of small Lasektdi^ which run obliquely downwards and inwards. Two or three of these Slips, however, go in the opposite direction â€¢, and one of them, termed Oblique higament^ and Choi da Transversalh Cubitii is stretched between the Tubercle of the Ulna and under part of the Tubercle of the Radius. In different parts of the Interosseous Ligament there are Perforations for the passage of Blood-vessels from the fore to the back part of the Fore-Arm, and a large Opening is found at the upper edge of it, which is oc- cupied by Muscles. Th is Ligament assists in binding the Ulna and Ra- dius together, prevents the Radius from rolling too much outwards, and furnishes a commodious attach- ment for Muscles. Tlic Capsular^ or Saccifonn Ugamm:% which arises from the edges of the Semilunar Cavity at the under end of the Radius, and surrounds the Head of the Ulna, allowing the Radius to turn upon Uie Ulna, in perform- ing the different motions of Pronation and Supination of the Hand. Ligaments, &c. bekjoeen the Fore-Arm and Wrist. The Capsular Ligament^ which arises from the Mar- gin of the Glenoid or Navicular Cavity of the Radius, and from tile edge of the moveable Cartilage at the Head

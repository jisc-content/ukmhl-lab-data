Part I.] OF THE BONES. 35 Cavities between the smaller Arch and the Foramen Magnum, for the reception of the Recti Minoi*es. The perpendicular Spine, running through the middle of the two Arches, and separating the Muscles of the opposite sides. The unequal Edges of the Foramen Magnum, for the insertion of Ligaments, by which the Head is fixed to the Vertebrae of the Neck. The infer ior Angle, contrary to the rest of the Bone, flattened and stretched forwards in form of a wedge; hence called Cuneiform, or, from its situation. Basilar Process. The unequal Surface of the Cuneiform Process, for the attachment of the Recti Anteriores Muscles. The Condyles placed at the Base of the Cuneiform Process, and at the fore and lateral parts of the Fora- men Magnum, for the Articulation with the Atlas, or first Vertebra of the Neck. ^ The oval form and smooth Cartilaginous Surface of the Condyles, corresponding with the superior articu- lating Processes of the Atlas. The Condyles run obliquely forwards and inwards, and are deepest at their inner parts ; in consequence of which they are prevented from sliding to either side out of the Cavities of the Atlas. In some Subjects, each of the Condyles is more or less divided, giving the appearance of two Prominences. Round their Roots, the surface is unequal, for the attachment of the Capsular Ligaments. The rough Prominences between the Condyles and Mastoid Processes of the Temporal Bones, for the in- C 2 sertion 1

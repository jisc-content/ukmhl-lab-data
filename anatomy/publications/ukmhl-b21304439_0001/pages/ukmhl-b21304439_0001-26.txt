10 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Bones in general, and is divided into numberless small })arts, which also line the dillerent Cancelli. It forms so many irregular Bags, communicating with each otlter, and adbrding a large surface for the dispersion of the secretory Vessels of the Marrow. Marrow. The Marro'io may be considered as an Appendage to die general Corpus Adiposum. It is deposited by the Arteries in the Cavities of the Bones, at the same time that the rest of the Body is supplied with Fat. The Blood-vessels of the Marrow', surrounded by the Periosteum, enter the Bones by oblique Canals, which have already been taken notice of in the description of the Bones in general. Mdien the Arteries have entered the Cavities of the Bones, they divide into Branches, which arc spread out upon the Cancelli, Membrana Mcdullaris, and Marrow; from these many minute Branches are reflected out- wards to the Tables of the Bones, which communicate with those sent from the inner surface of the Perios- teum. The Veins which return the Blood from the MaiTow and Substance of the Bones, are collected into small Trunks, which pass out where the Arteries penetrated the Bones, and discharge their contents into the neigh- bouring Veins. The greater degree of Vascularity of the Solids in Children than in Adults, is no where more conspicuous than here; for Injections which pass readily in these Vessels

The Part L] OF THE BONES. IS f and the Articular Cartilages, by long boiling, are found to be in a great measure dissolved. One set of Cartilages supply the place of Bone;—or, by their flexibility, admit of a certain degree of motion, while their elasticity recovers their natural position ;— as in the N^ose, Larynx^ Cartilages the Itibs^ Carti- lages supplying Briihs to Cavities^ &c. Another set, in Children, supply the place of Bone, until Bone is formed, and afford a Nidus for the Os- seous Fibres to shoot in ;—as in the long Bones of Chil- dren. A third set, the most extensive, by the smoothness and slipperiness of their surface, allow the Bones to move readily, without any abrasion ;—as in the Cartilages of the Joints. By their elastic nature, they render the motions easier, and lessen the concussion in the more violent motions of the Body, as running, jumping, &ct They also prevent the inordinate growth of Bones at - their articulating surfaces, and the coalescence of the Fibres of the adjoining Bones. A fourth set supply the office both of Cartilages and Ligament, giving the elasticity of the former, and flexi- bility of the latter ; uniting some immoveably together, and allowing to others a small degree of motion ;—as in the Cartilages of the Bones of the Pelvis and Spine. Of the Formation of Bone. The generality of Bones are originally formed, either between Membranes, or in the Substance of Cartilages; the Teeth are formed in distinct Bags.

ys COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paht I. The connection oi tlicBone to the Ossa Parietalia, by the Lambcloid Suture. This Bone is among the thickest of the Cranium, though very unequal *, being thick and strong above, where it is little alicctcd by Muscles, and so thin below, where it is pressed by the weight of the Cerebellum in- ternally, and by the action of the Muscles externally, as to be in many Skulls rendered transparent. But the tliick Muscles and strong Spine of the Bone assist great- ly in proventing'iujuries from happening here. In the Foetus, the Occipital Bone is divided into four .pieces; the first, which is larger than the other three, forms all the part of the Bone above the Foramen Mag- num ; the second and third are placed at the sides of that Foramen, and constitute almost the whole of the Condvles ; and the fourth forms the Cuneiform Process. Ossa Temporum. In these we observe. The situation of each Temporal Bone in the under and lateral part of the Cranium. Tlie Squanums Plate^ which forms a part of the Temple, and gives origin to a portion of the Temporal Muscle. The Squamous Plate appearing equal and smooth externally, with a ihin semicircular edge above, which, by overlapping the under edge of the Parietal Bone, irives name to this Process. The Mastoid or Mammillary Process, giving insertion to strong Muscles, particularly the Sterno-mastoid; and containing

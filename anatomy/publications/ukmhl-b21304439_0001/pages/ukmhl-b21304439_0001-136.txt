120 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The scend, and their Bases larger than tlieir inferior extre- mities. The posterior Surfaces convex^ and covered chiefly by the Tendinous Expansions of the Extensors of the Fingers. Their anterior Surfaces and in some parts con- cavcy for lodging the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles. Ridges at the sides of their anterior Surfaces, for the attachment of the retaining Ligaments of the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles. The first Phalanx longer than the second, and the second than the third. The Bases of the first Phalanx formed into Sockets^ to receive the Balls of the Metacarpal Bones, and to allow motion to all sides. The lower ends of this Phalanx, consisting of Prominences^ and middle Cavities or Pulleys, the Carti- laginous Surfaces of which reach considerably farther up in the fore than in the back part. The Bases of the second Phalanx, with lateral Cavi- tieSf and middle Ridges, corresponding with the Pulleys of the first Phalanx, and axlmitting of flexion and ex- . tension only. i fi The lo"iVer ends of this Phalanx, similar to those of the first. The Bases of the third Phalanx, like those of the se- cond, and the motions also similar. The under ends of the third Phalanx rough, where the Pulpy, Vascular, and Nervous Substance of the points of the Fingers is situated, r . .

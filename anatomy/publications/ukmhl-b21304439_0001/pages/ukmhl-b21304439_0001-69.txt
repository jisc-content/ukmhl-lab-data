5^ OF THE BONEÂ«. Part L] The D 3 area of the Face in the European is observed to be only half of that of the Cranium, but is somewhat more in the Negro; or, the Face is larger in the one, while the Cranium is bigger in the other. In the Bones of the Face we observe, Their Division into Upper and Under Javcs. The Upper Jaw, or Maxilla Superior, besides the Teeth, composed of seven Pair of Bones, and one Kaith- out a felUm, viz. Two Ossa Nasi; Two Ossa Unguis; Two Ossa Ma~ lanm ; Two Ossa Maxillaria Superiora ; Ttvo Ossa Pa- lati; Two Ossa Spongiosa Inferiora ; Two Ossa Trian- gidaria ; and the Vomer. The Lower Jaw, or Maxilla Inferior, consists of a single Bone, with the Teeth. The Bones of the Upper Jaw are joined together by Sutures which have no distinct Indentations, like those of the Cranium; but, like them, they are frequently found obliterated in the Skulls of old people. The Bones here, in consequence of the nature of the Su- tures, have no motion but what they possess in common with the Cranium. The Sutures shall be taken notice of in the description of the Bones between which the;/ are placed. Ossa Nasi. Their Situation in the upper and fore part of the Nose. The oblong Fonn of each, though irregularly so.

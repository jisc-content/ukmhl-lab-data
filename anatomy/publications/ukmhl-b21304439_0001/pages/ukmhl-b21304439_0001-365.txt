Past III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. 313 Ligaments connecting the Bones of the Tarsus â€¢with those of the Leg. The Anterior Ligament of the Fibula^ which arises from the anterior part of the Malleolus Externus, and passes obliquely forwards, to be fixed to the upper and outer part of the Astragalus. The Middle, or Ber-pendicidar Ligament of the Fibula, which arises from the point of tlie Malleolus Externus, and descends almost perpendicularly, to be inserted into the outside of the Os Calcis. The Posterior Ligament of the Filnda, which arises from the under and back part of the Malleolus Externus, and runs backwards, to be joined to the outer and pos- terior part of the Astragalus. The Ligamentum Delloides of the Tibia, which arises from the Malleolus Internus, and descends in a radiated form, to be attached to the Astragalus, Os Cakis, and Os Naviculare. The Capsular Ligament, which lies within the former Ligaments, and is remarkably thin, especially before and behind, for. the readier motion of the Joint. It arises from the Margin of the Articular Cavity of the Tibia and Fibula, and is fixed round the edge of the Articular Surface of the Astragalus. The Ligaments and the other constituent parts of the Ankle-joint form it into a complete Hinge, which allows flexion and extension, but no rotation nor lateral motion, in the bended state of the Foot, though a small degree of each when it is fully extended. i Ligaments

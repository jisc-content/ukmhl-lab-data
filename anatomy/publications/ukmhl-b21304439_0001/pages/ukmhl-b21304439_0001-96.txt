80 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartI. The The convex irregular Surface behind, where strong Muscles arise, which assist in extending the Spine and Thigh. Four transverse prominent Lines seen anteriorly, indi- cating the situation of the Cartilages which originally divided the Bone into five pieces. The Spinal Canal, of a triargular form, of great size above, but becoming gradually smaller in its de- scent ; corresponding to the size of the under end of the Spinal Marrow, termed Cauda Equina, which goes through it. The tmder part of the Spinal passage, commonly open behind *, the Canal being completed, in the Sub- ject, by the addition of a strong Ligamentous Mem- brane. 'I'he Arch at the sides and back part of the Spinal Canal, much thicker and stronger than in the true Ver- Tel)ric. 'I'he ivio Oblique Processes belonging to this Bone, lacing backwards, to correspond with the two inferior Processes of the last Lumbar Vertebra. A large Obloiig Process on each side of the Bone, formed by the concretion of all the original Transverse Processes. 'I'he upper lateral parts of the Bone, which corre- spond with the three superior Transverse Processes, divided into treo irregular Cavities on each side, by a perpendicular Ridge. The anterior of the two Cavities lined wdth Cartilage, which glues this Bone to the Os Ilium, and in such a manner as not to allow any motion.

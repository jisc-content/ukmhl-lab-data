f 2S5 Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. the f i inserted into tlie inner Surface of the Angle of the ! Lower Jaw, near its posterior Foramen ;—assisting to 1 keep the Jaw in situ, and to prevent the inferior Maxil- ! lary Vessels and Nerve from being injured by the action ' of the Pterygoid Muscle. Ligaments connecting the Head ujith the First and Se- cond Vertebra the Neck, and these two Verte- ! BR^ with each other. ! The two Capsidar Ligaments, which arise from the margin of the superior articulating Processes of the Atlas, and are inserted into the Base of the Condyles of the Occipital Bone, where the Head has its flexion and extension without rotation. The Ciradar Ligament, which arises from the edge . of the Spinal Hole of the first Vertebra, is connected > with the Capsular Ligaments of the superior articulating V Processes of the Atlas, and is inserted into the edge oi i the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone. I The two Capsular Ligaments, which fix the inl’erior I oblique Processes of the Atlas to the superior oblique of the Vertebra Dentata, and admit of the rotation of the Head, with a small degree of flexion to eitlicr side. ' The Perpendicular Ligament, which fixes the Proces- sus Dentatus of the second Vertebra to the edge of the anterior part of the Foramen Magnum, and is twisted in the rotation of the Head. The two Lateral, or Moderator Ligaments, which arise each from the side of the Processus Dentatus, and run outwards and upwards to be fixed to the inner part of

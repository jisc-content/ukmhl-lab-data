76 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The tatus, and by the Transverse Ligament which passes behind that Process. An Arch upon the back part of the Atlas, instead of a Spinous Process, marked by Muscles and Ligaments. 'Iâ€™he Superior Oblupie Processes^ oval, danting, and holloTiV, for receiving the Condyles of the Occipital Bone. A curved Fossa under the outer and back part of each Oblique Process, for the passage of the Vertebral Ar- teries into the Plead, and Tenth Pair of Nerves out of it. The Transverse Processes, longer than in any other Cervical Vertebra, for the origin of several Muscles. The Connection of the Atlas to the Occipital Bone, where the Plead has its Jlexion and extension, but little other motion. The second Vertebra, called Dentata, from the Tooth- like Process on the upper part of its Body. The Body of this Vertebra larger than the rest, and of a Conical figure. The fore part of the Processus Dentatus, convex and covered vcith Cartilage where it tunis upon the Atlas. It has the same appearance behind, where it moves upon the Transverse Ligament. The Sides of this Process, marked by the insertion of the lateral Ligaments, and its point by the insertion of the perpendicular Ligament which is fixed to the edge of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone. The Sitperior Oblique Processes placed horizontally, and a little elevated in the middle, to be received into the hollow Inferior Oblique Processes of the Atlas, where the Head has'its principal rotatory motion.

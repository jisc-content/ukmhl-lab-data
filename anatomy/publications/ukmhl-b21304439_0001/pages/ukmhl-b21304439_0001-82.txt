Ofi COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part 1. side to that of the other j and thickest behind, corre- sponding there with the increased^ thickness of the Teeth. The Alveolar Process, composed of two Plates, and divided by cross Partitions, which, as in the Upper Jaw,, mark the different Alveoli for the Fangs of the Teeth. The Posterior Part of the Internal Plate, slanting in- wards, and thinner than the External, giving the Jaw a twisted appearance. Opposite the Alveoli, the External Plate swelling, and giving a fluted form, \vhich is observed in the whole extent of the Alveolar Process of the U]>per Jaw, and in the fore part of the Lower Jaw. At the fore part of the Jaw, the Alveoli are perpen- dicular, but turn inwards behind, where they are placed nearer the inner than the outer part of the Jaw. The Sockets worn down by old age, in consequence of which the Teeth drop out, the Jaw becomes narrower, and, when the Mouth is shut, appears more prominent. The posterior Maxillai'y Foramen at the roots of the Condyloid and Covonoid Processes, upon the inner side of the Jaw, for the j^assage of the Third, or inferior Maxillary Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, with the corresponding Blood-Vessels. A small-pointed Process at the inner edge of this Hole, where a Ligament goes offâ€™ to be fixed to the Temporal Bone. Above the Hole, the Bone marked by the passage of the Nerve and Vessels ; and belpw it, commonly a small Furrffw, pointing out the course of a Nerve which goes to a Muscle and Gland under the Tongue.

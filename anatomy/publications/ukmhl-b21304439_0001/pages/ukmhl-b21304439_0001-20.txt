4. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paht I. The Plates of Bones are originally formed by the Vessels of the Periosteum Externum and Membrana Mcdullaris, and not, as has been supposed by some Authors, from Layers detached from the external Pe- riosteum. The Plates are connected by Fibres^ which some have considered as Clavicidi or Nails, and called Perpendicu- lar, Oblique, &c. according to their different directions. The outei' Plates of Bones are firmly compacted, so as to appear like one solid substance. The inner Parts of Bones in general, wliether long, round, or flat, have their Plates and Threads running in various directions, intersecting each other, and forming the Cancclli, or Spongy Substance of the Bones; the Cancelli every where communicating with each other. The Cancelli, in the middle of long Bones, are Fi- brous, and form the Reticular Substance which divides the Bone into large Cells. Towards the extremities of long Bones, the Cancelli are lamellated, and much more numerous than in their middle. Cancelli, of a similar nature to those of the long Bones, are also placed between the Tables of flat, and inner parts of round Bones. In some of the broad Bones, however, as the Scapula, the solid parts are so much compressed as to leave little or no room for Cancelli. On the contrary, in the middle of the long Bones, as the Os Plumeri, the Cavities are so large as to give to the Bone the appearance of a hollovo Cylinder. In- some of the largest of the long Bones, as the Os Femoris,

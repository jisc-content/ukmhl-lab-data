The Obturator Membrane, or Ligament of the Fora- men Thyroideum, which adheres to the Margin of the Foramen Thyroideum, and fills the whole of that Open- ing, excepting the Oblique Notch at its upper part for ) the passage of the Obturator Vessels and Nerve. It * assists in supporting the Contents of the Pelvis, and in giving origin to the Obturatores. By yielding a little in the time of Labour, it contributes in a small degree to an easier Delivery.

From the strength of the Ligaments which unite these Bones to each other, and from the plainness of their Ar- ticulating Surfaces, no more motion is allowed than to prevent the effects of concussion in walking, leaping, &c. Ligaments heL'ween the Tarsus and Metatarsus. The Bones of the Metatarsus are fixed to those of the Tarsus by Capstdar, and numerous other Ligaments^ which are called Dorsal, Plantar, Lateral, accortling to their situations;—Straight, Oblique, or Ti ansverse, according to their directions. The nature of this Joint is the same with that between the Carpus and Metacarpus. Ligaments connecting the Metatarsal Bones to each other. The Dorsal, Plantar, and Lateral Ligaments, which connect the Bases of the Metatarsal Bones with each other. The Transverse Ligaments, which join the Heads of these Bones together. Ligaments of the Phalanges of the Toes. The Capsular and Lateral Ligaments i—resembling those of the Fingers. Ligaments ajid Sheaths retaining the Tendons of the Muscles of the Foot and Toes, in sihi. The Annular Ligament of the Tarsus, which is a thickened part of the Aponeurosis of the Leg, splitting into superior and inferior portions, which bind down the

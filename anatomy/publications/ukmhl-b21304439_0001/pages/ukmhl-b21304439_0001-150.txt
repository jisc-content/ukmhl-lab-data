I3i COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. â€™ 'I lie Os Calcis, the largest of the Tarsal Bones, si- tuated under the Astragalus, and in the back part of the Foot. A large rough TuherosUy or Knob, projecting behind, to form the Heel, and to make one end of the Arch of the Foot. A sujperjicial Cavity in the upper and back part of this Knob, for the insertion of the Tendo AchiUis. A smooth Convexity on the upppr part of the Bone, for its articulation with the under and back part of the Astragalus. A Fossa or Sinuous Cavity at the fore part of this ar- ticulating Surface, running forwards and outwards, and giving origin 'to strong Ligaments which are inserted into the corresponding Fossa of the Astragalus. Tivo Framincnccs at the inner and fore part of the Bone, concave, and smooth above, w'ith a Pit between them, for the articulation with the under and fore part of the Astragalus. Frpm the posterior Prominence the Cartilaginous Li- gament arises, which is fixed to the Os Naviculare. A large Cavity or Arch at the inner side of the Bone, between the posterior of the two last-mentioned Pro- cesses and Projection of the Heel, for lodging the Ten- dons of the long Flexprs of the Toes, together with thp Vessels and Nerves of the Sole, A Degression jn the external Surface of the Bone, near its fore part, where the Tendon of the Peroneiis Longus runs in its way to the Sole. The under and back part of the Bone, forming "wo Prominences, where it gives origin to the Aponeuiosis, and

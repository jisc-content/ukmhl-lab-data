Its Fleshy Belly sends off four round Tendons before it passes under the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare Anterius. In their course, they are connected to those of the following Muscle by fine Membranous Webs, and upon the Fingers are inclosed in strong Tendinous Sheaths. Insertion: Into the anterior and upper part of the second Phalanx of the Fingers, being, near the under part of the first Phalanx, split and twisted to form a Passage, and at the same time a kind of Sheath, for the Tendons of the Flexor Profundus.

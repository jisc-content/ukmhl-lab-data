Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. 283 redder colour, from the numerous Blood-vessels dis- perse<l upon them. They have been generally considered as Glands lodg- ed within Masses of Fat; but, upon a minute inspec- tion, no knotty or Glandular bodies are to be found in them ; nor have they the appearance of Glands, farther than in being Secreting Substances ; which circumstance alone assimilates them to the nature of Glands. From the edges of these Fatty bodies, Fimbriee hang loose, and convey a lubricating Liquor, called Synovtat into the Cavity of the Joints. From the extremities of these Fringes^ the Liquor can be readily squeezed out by pressure; but their Cavities and Orifices arc so minute, or are otherwise of such a nature, as to have hitherto eluded discovery. ILc Fimbriae have been generally considered as Ex~ creto}y Ducts of Glands within the Joints. Dr Mon- ro, however, in his Work upon the Bursae Mucosai, supposes tliein to be of the nature of the Follirlrs oj the Urethra^ which prepare a Mucilaginous I.icjuor, witliout the assistance of any knotty or CHandular Or- gan. The Arteries which supply these Bodies with Blood for their Secretion, and the J^eins which return the Blood after the Secretion has been performed, can be readily seen ; but no Nerves can be traced into them; nor does it appear that they possess a higher degree of Sensibility than the other parts of the Joints already described, although, when they inflame and suppurate, they have in some instances been observed to occasion the most excruciating pain.

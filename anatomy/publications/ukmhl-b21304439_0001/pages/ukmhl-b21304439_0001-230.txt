178 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartIL || jl; Spine of the Ilium. This is the Ring of the External | Obliqxie Muscley or Supra-Ruhial Ring, for the transmis- j| sion of the Spermatic Cord in the Male, and the round j Ligament of the Uterus in the Female, and where the Bowels protrude in the Inguinal Plernia. Surrounding the exit of the Cord, or the round Li- gament, from the Ring, there is a quantity of Cellular Substance, and some Tendinttus Fibres, which assist in ; filling that passage, and in preventing any conimunica- i tion between the outer and inner parts.- The place where the columns separate to form the i Ring varies in different Subjects. In some, the separa- i tion is considerably farther out than the part already | described, though more generally the division is at the i| outer end of the Ring. At this end of the Ring, the || Columns are joined by Tendinous Fibres, which arise ii from the Os Ilium, and from Poupart’s Ligament; ;l and are part of the Fibres mentioned above, as decus- [i sating the Tendon of the External Oblique Muscle. i Through the Abdominal Ring, there is no direct ;• opening into the Cavity of the Abdomen ; the passage | being shut by the Obliquus Internus, and Transversalis II Abdominis. , Over the Tendon of the External Oblique Muscle, there is a thin Expansion, or Supetjicial Fascia^ con- |j sisting chiefly of Transverse Fibres. This can also be ^ traced down upon the fore part of the Thigh. It ad- i heres to the whole length of the Crural Arch. Part of ; it passes along the Spermatic Cord as far as the Scro- l turn, the rest of it spreads over the Inguinal Glands, i and vanishes in the Fat of the Thigh.

302 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paht III. fixed iu a similar manner to that of the under Row, chiefly admitting of flexion and extension, and that in a smaller degree than in tlie former Joint. The Short Ligaments of the Bones of the Carpus, wliich are small Ligamentous Slips running in various directions, joining the different Bones of the Carpus, —first of the same Row, then of the two Rows toge- ther. 'riiey are termed Oblique, Trajisversc, Capsular, and Proper Ligaments of the Bones of the Wrist, and admit only of a small degree of yielding between the different Bones in the same Row. Ligaments belxceeyi the Carpal and Metacarpal Bones. The Articular Ligaments, which arise from the Mar- gins of the second Row of the Carpal Bones, and arc fixed to the Margins of the adjoining Bones of the Me- tacarpus. Other Ligaments run in a radiated manner from the Carpal to the Metacarpal Bones •, the whole getting the names of Articular, Lateral, Straight, Pa - pendicular, &c. according to their different directions. From the flatness of the Articular Surfaces, and strength of the Connecting Ligaments, very little mo- tion is allowed between the Carpus and ^Metacarpus. Ligaments betxreeyi the ’Extremities of the Metacarpai. Bones. I The Interosseous Ligaments at the Bases of the Meta- carpal Bones. They are short Slips, which run trans- versely.

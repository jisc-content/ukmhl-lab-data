•m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PAra’ ill. are fine Membranous Webs connecting the Tendons of the Sublimis, first to each other, then to those of the Profundus, and forming, at the same time. Bursae Mu- cosae, which surround these Tendons. The Vaginal or Crucial Ligaments of the Phalangesy which arise from the Ridges on the concave side of the ^ Phalanges, and run over the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers. Upon the Body of the Pha- langes, they are thick and strong, to bind down the I’cndons while their Muscles are in action; but over the Joints they are thin, and have, in some parts, a Oucial appearance, to allow the ready motion of the .loints. "I'he Accessory Ligaments of the Flexor Tendons of the FingerSy wliich are small Tendinous FreenOy arising from the first and second Phalanges of the Fingers. They run obliquely forwards within the Vaginal Ligaments, terminate in the Tendons of the Two Flexor Muscles of the Fingers, and assist in keeping them in their places. The Extei'nal Transvetscy or Posterior Annular Li- gament of the Wristy which is part of the Aponeurosis of the Fore-Arm, extending across the back of the Wrist, from the inner side of the extremity of the Ul- fia and Os Pisiforme to the outer side of the extremity of the^ladius. It is connected with the small Annular Ligaments which tie down the Tendons of the Exten- sores Ossis Metacarpi et Primi Internodii Pollicis, and the Extensor Carpi Ulnaris. JJie Vaoinal LivamentSy which adhere to the former Ligaments, and serve as Sheaths afnd Bursae Mu- cosae

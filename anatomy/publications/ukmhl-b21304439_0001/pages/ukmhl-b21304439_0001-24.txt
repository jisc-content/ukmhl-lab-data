» COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. CPart I. The proportion in different persons, in different Bones of the same person, and in the same Bone at different ages* The Earthy Matter, however, bears the largest propor- tion ; but this is less in Children than in persons of more advanced life. The Earthy Matter is obtained by Calcination, or by Maceration in a diluted acid, and afterwards precipitat- ing it, when it is found to consist chiefly of Phosphate of Lime. In either of these Processes, the Bone retains its shape; but in the former it is brittle, and of a pure white colour, while in the latter it is flexible, consisting principally of Cartilaginous Matter. By boiling in water for a sufficient length of time, and especially if under an increased pressure, as in Pa- pin’s Digester, the Fat and Gelatin of Bones are dissolv- ed and separated, and the Bone retaining its Earthy Matter preserves also its white colour. The general Use of Bones is,—to give firmness and shape to the Body, to furnish attachment to the Muscles, and serve as Levers for these to act on, and to lodge, protect, and support the Bowels. Periosteum. The Periosteum derives its name from its furnishing a general Covering to the Bones. In certain parts, however, it is perforated by Muscles, Ligaments, or Cartilages, which arc fixed immediately to the surface of the Bones; and at the Joints it sepa- rates from the Bones, to give a Covering to the Capsu- lar Ligaments. It is formed of many Fibres, which, in certain parts, can be divided into Layers,

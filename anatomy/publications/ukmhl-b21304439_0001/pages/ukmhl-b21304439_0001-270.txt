1318 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II, Scapula? which is below its Spine j and from the Spine itself as far as the Cervix Scapulae. The Fibres run obliquely towards a Tendon in the middle of the Muscle, which runs forwards, and adheres to the Capsular Liga- ment. Insertion: By a flat thick Tendon, into the upper and outer part of the large Protuberaiicc on the Head of the Os Humeri. Action: To roll the Os Humeri outwards j to assist in raising, and in supporting it when raised; and to pull the Ligament from between the Bones. These two Muscles are covered by an Aponeurosis, which extends between the Costae and edges of the Spine of the Scapula, and gives rise to many of the Muscular Fibres. Teres Minor, Vel S2iper-Scapulo-Trochitcreus Minimis. Origin: Fleshy, from the inferior Costa of the Sca- pula. It ascends along the under edge of the Infra- Spinatus, and adheres to the Capsular Ligament. Insertion: Tendinous, into the back part of the large Protuberance on the Head of the Os Humeri, a little below the Infra-Spinatus. Action: To roll the Os Humeri outwards, to draw it backwards, and to prevent the Ligament from being pinched between the Bones. Teris

39 OF THE BONES. Fart L] confining Cells which communicate with each other, aiyl with the Cavity of the Ear, called Tympanum. The Petrous Process, remarkably hard, very unequal, and of an oblong form, but becoming smaller in its pro- gress j placed at the base of the Bone, from which it runs obliquely forwards and inwards, and contains the inter- nal Organ of Hearing, to be afterwards described. The Zygomatic Process, running from the under and fore part of the Squamous Plate, to join the Os Malm; forming an Arch, on the inner side of which the Tem- poral Muscle passes to the Lower Jaw. A Tubercle of an oblong form at the root of this Pro- cess, covered with a smooth Cartilage, making part of the Articulation of the Lower Jaw. . The Styloid Process, placed at the root of the Pars Petrosa, and going obliquely downwards and forwards, to give origin to Muscles which borrow' part of their name from it, and belontj to the Tongue and Throat. It is generally about an inch in length, though some- times a great deal more, and is remarkably slender. It is frequently, even in Adults, not entirely ossified, and is therefore apt to drop off in macerating the Bones. I he V^inal Process, of an inconsiderable size, siur- rounding the root of the Styloid Process, and deepest at its fore part. The Rough Semicircular Ridge, at the under part of the exteiâ€™nal Meatus ; sometimes also considered as a Process, and called Auditory, tor the connection of the Cartilage of the Ear. A Groove at the inner part of the root of the Mastoid Process, giving origin to the Digastric Muscle 5 and a C 4 little

The posterior Surface of the Cranium is marked by the insertion of Muscles arising from the back part of the Trunk. The uppa' and inner Surface of the Cranium is liol- lo'ii'y for lodging the Brain. The wider and inner Surface of the Cranium has many unequal CavitieSy for lodging the Lobes and Ap- pendages of the Brain and Cerebellum, and for allowing passage to the Vessels and Nerves of the Encephalon in general. Along the inner side of the Cranium are many Fur- rows, for the reception of the Blood-vessels of the Dura Mater. Upon the inner Surface of certain Crania, Sinuosities are observed, for lodging luxuriances of the Brain ; and here the Cranium is sometimes so thin, as to be render- ed trans])arent; the two Tables being then closely com- pacted without any Cancelli. In some Crania, Pits arc seen of different figures and sizes, for lodging Granidous Bodies on the Dura Mater, termed

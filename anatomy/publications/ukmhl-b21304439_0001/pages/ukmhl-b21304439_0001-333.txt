.1 Part III.3 OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. 2S1 nature of a Hinge^ the Ligament is strongest at the sides of that Flinge. The mta' part of the Capsular Ligament is formed of a continuation of the Pei-iostetm, which is connected to the surrounding parts by Cellular Substance; while the inner Layer,—remarkably thin and dense,—is reflected over the Bones and Cartilages which the Ligament in- cludes *, one part of it thus forming Peiiosteiim, and the other Perichondrium. In certain parts of the Body, there are, besides the Capsular Ligaments, others for the firmer connection of the Bones, or for confining the motion to one par- ticular side; as the Round Ligament of the Thigh, or Citicialf or Lateral Ligaments of the Knee. Wherever the Ligaments are few, long, and weak, the motions are more extensive; and, on the contrary, where the Ligaments are numerous, short, and strong, the motions are more limited. In some parts of the Body, Ligaments supply the place of Bone, as in the Pelvis: In others, they give origin to Muscles, as between the Radius and Ulna: In some parts, they assist in connecting immoveable Bones, as at the Os Sacrum and Os Innominatum: In ^ others, they form a Socket in which moveable Bones play, as where part of the Astragalus moves on the Li- gament stretched between the Os Calcis and Os Sea-- phoides. Ligaments have numerous Blood-vessels, v/hieh can be readily injected. Upon the inner surface of the Capsular Ligaments, their

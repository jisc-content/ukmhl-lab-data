The / Part L] OF THE BONES. 59 The Sinm Maxillaris, Antncm MaxillarCi or, from its describe!’, called Highmoriaminii of great size, occupy- ing the whole inner part of the Body of the Bone, si- tuated under the Orbitar Plate, and above the large Dentes Molares, destined for the same purposes as the other Sinuses of the Bones of the Plead. The Partition between the Sinus and Sockets of tlie Teeth is commonly of considerable thickness ; but not unfrequently there is only a thin Plate interposed, and small Prominences, containing the points of the roots of the Teeth, may often be observed in the middle of this Cavity. The Opening of the Sinus, large in the separated Maxillary Bone, but, in the connected state, so covered by the inferior Spongy Bone, and by the Palate-Bone and Membranes, as [to leave only one, or sometimes two Apertures, little larger than to admit the point of a Surgeon’s Probe. The Aperture is situated at the upper part of the Sinus, and descends obliquely back- wards to terminate between the Ossa Spongiosa supe- rius et inferius, in the Cavity of the Nose. The Connection of the Os Maxillare Superius to the Frontal Bone, by the Transverse Suture;—to the Os Unguis, by the Lacrymal Suture;—to the Os Nasi, by the Lateral Nasal Suture j—to the Cheek-Bone, by the internal and external Orbitar Sutures ;—to the Os Pla- num, by the Ethmoid Suture;—to its fellow, by the Longitudinal Palate Suture;—to its fellow also, between the fore part of the Nose and Mouth, by the Mysta- chial Suture.

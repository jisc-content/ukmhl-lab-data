194 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartII. Inferior, or Lesser Muscle, or Appendix of the Diaphragm. Origin: By four Pair of Heads, of which one Pair in the middle, commonly called its Long, or Tendinous Cruruy is the longest. The long Crura arise from the fore part of the fourtli Lumbar Vertebra, and adhere to the Bodies of all the Vertebrae of the Loins above nis, by the intervention of the Ligamentum Commune An- terius covering these Bones. In their ascent, they leave an oval opening for the passage of the Aorta and Tho- racic Duct. The other Heads arise from the third, and also from the second Lumbar Vertebra, and are placed farther out. From the different Heads the Muscular Fibres run upwards, and form, in the middle, two fleshy Columns, or Crura, which decussate, and leave an open- ing for the passage of the Oesophagus. Insertion: By strong Fleshy Fibres, into the posterior edge of the Cordiform, or middle Tendon. Action: To enlarge the Cavity of the Thorax in In- spiration, by its Fleshy part contracting, and bringing its two sides down from a convex to a plane Surface ; the Abdominal Muscles at the same time yielding, but the Tendinous'part of the Diaphragm remaining nearly in the same situation. In Expiration, the Diaphragm is replaced, chiefly by the action of the Abdominal Muscles. It is the Antagonist of the Abdominal Mus- cles in Inspiration, but acts in concert with them in De- jection and in Voraiiting. Quadbatus

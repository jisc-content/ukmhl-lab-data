28i COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartIII. The Synovia, which is a thin Mucilaginous Liquor, resembling the glair of an egg, appears to be furnished, not only by the Substances already mentioned, but also by the inner Surface of the Capsular Ligaments in ge- neral, and serves for the lubrication of the Joints. LIGAMENTS op the HEAD and TRUNK. Ligaments of the Lower Jaw. The Capsular Ligament on each side, which arises ii om the whole Margin of the Articular Cavity of the Tem- poral Bone, and is inserted, first into the edge of the Interarticular Cartilage, formerly token notice of, and afterwards round the Cervix of the Lower Jaw. This Ligament, like others which belong to Joints of the Hinge kind, is thickest and strongest at the sides of the Joint, to confine the lateral motion of the Jaw. By it the Jaw is allowed to move upwards, down- wards, or a little forwards or backwards, or to either side, and the motions are rendered easier by the inter- vention of the Interarticular Cartilage, which follows the Condyle in its different motions. The Suspensoiy Ligament of the Stylo-glossus, which is attached by one end to the Styloid Process, and to a Ligament running from that Process to the OsHyoides, and by the other end to the Angle of the Lower Jaw; â€”serving to support the Stylo-glossus, and to give ori- gin to part of it. The Lateral Ligament, which arises from the Margin #f the Articular Cavity of the Temporal Bone, and is inserted

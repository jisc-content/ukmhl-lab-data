45 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. CPart I. the part of the Biain, and by the Arteries of the Dura Mater. The Pars Petrosa, of great size, running forwards and inwards, with a sharp angle above, and two flat sides â€¢, one facing obliquely forwards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. llie anterior and outer Surface of the Pars Petrosa opposed to the lateral Lobes of the Brain. I'he posterior and inner Surface of the Pars Petrosa opposed to the Cerebellum. The Ridge between the tw'o Surfaces of the Pars Pe- trosa, for the attachment of the Tentorium Durse Ma- tris. A Groove frequently found upon the Ridge of the Pars Petrosa, for lodging the superior Petrosal Sinus. A Fossa, at the root of the posterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, and opposite to the Mastoid Process, for lodging the Lateral Sinus, where it turns downwards to go out of the Cranium. In this Fossa the Passage is ob- served which corresponds with the Foramen Mastoidcum. . The Lateral Sinuses are frequently of unequal size ; of course this Cavity is then larger in one Temporal Bone than in the other. I'lie Meatus Auditorius Internus, or Foramen Auditi- vum, passing outwards and backwards, in the posterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, for the passage of the Se- venth Pair of Nerves, and the principal Artery belong- ing to the inner ear. In the bottom of this passage, there are many Fora- mina ; one above, more conspicuous than the rest, is the beginning of the passage for the Portio- Dura of

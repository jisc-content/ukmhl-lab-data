Part HI.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c. 301 Head of the Ulna, and is fixed to the Cartilaginous edges of the three first Bones of the Carpus. The Inter-Articular Cartilage^ placed between the Head of the Ulna and Os Cunciforme, and which is a continuation of the Cartilage covering the end of the Radius. It is concave above and below, and is connect- ed loosely to the end of the Styloid Process. The T’iSio Lateral Ligaments^ one of which arises from the Styloid Process at the under end of the Radius, and is fixec^o the Os Naviculare ; and the other from the Stvloid Process of the Ulna, and is fixed to the Cunei- foi’m and Pisiform Bones. The Ligaments of this Joint allow extensive motion forwards and backwards j and a considerable degree of it to either side. The Mucous Ligament^ which lies within the Joint, and extends from the Groove between the two first Bones of the Carpus, to the corresponding part of the Radius. It is supposed to regulate the Mucous Organ connected with it. Ligaments of the Carpus. The Anterior, Annular, or Transverse Ligament, which is stretched across from the projecting Points of the Ossa Pisiformc and Unciforme, to the Scaphoides and Trapezium, and forms an Arch which covers and preserves in their places the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers. Tlie Capsular Ligament, wh'ich arises from the Carti- iiiginous edge of the upper Row of the Carpus, and is fixed

70 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Os FIyoides. I'hc circumstances to be attended to here arc, The Situation of that Bone, at the root of the 'Iâ€™ongue and top of the Larynx. The Shape, compared to that of the Greek letter v. The Boclp of the Bone, the middle broad part, co?i- x'ex before, and concave, behind. The concavity behind, oblique, to receive the Thy- roid Cartilage, when the Os Hyoides and Larynx are pulled towards each other. Several Impressions seen on its Body, occasioned by tlie numerous Muscles fixed to it. The Cornua, extending backwards and upwards from each side of the Body, with their two plain Surfaces slanting from above downwards and outwards, and giv- ing attachment to Muscles and Ligaments of the Tongue and Larynx. Each of the Cornua becoming gradually smaller in its course backw'ards, and endijig in a round Tubercle, which is connected to the upper Cornu of the Thyroid Cartilage. Between the Body and Cornua frequently a Furrow, pointing out the former separation in young subjects. The Appendices, having the size and form of a grain of decorticated Barley, placed at the upper part of the Articulation between the Body and Cornua, for the at- tachment of Muscles. From each Appendix, a Ligament is sent up to the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone, to assist in con- pecting the Os Hyoides to the Cranium.

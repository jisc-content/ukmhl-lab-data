j Part II.] . OF THE MUSCLES. 159 arises from the Bones which give origin to the upper semicircular part of the Temporal Muscle, and, de- scending over it, is fixed to the Zygoma. Use: To brace the whole, and to give origin to part of the Temporal Muscle. Temporalis, vel Temporo-Maxillaris. Origin: Semicircular and Fleshy, from the lower half of the Parietal Bone, and Temporal Fossa of the Frontal Bone; and from the Squamous part of the Temporal, and Temporal Plate of the Sphenoid Bone. —It arises likewise from the Aponeurosis covering it;— from these origins the Fibres descend like Radii, and the Muscle sends off a strong Tendon, which passes under the Jugum. Insertion: Into the whole of the Coronoid Process of the Lower Jaw, which it incloses as in a Sheath, and is continued to near the last Dens Molaris. Action : To pull the Lower Jaw upwards, and a little backwards against the Upper Jaw. Massetkr, vel Zygomato-Maxillaris. Origin : By strong Tendinous and Fleshy Fibres from the Superior Maxillary Bone, where it joins the Os Malse, and from the whole length of the under and in- ner edge of the Zygoma *,—the outer part of the Muscle slanting backwards, the inner part forwards, and in some measure decussating the other. In its descent, it covers the

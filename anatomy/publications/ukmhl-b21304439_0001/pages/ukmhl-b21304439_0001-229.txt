[Part H.] OF THE MUSCLES. 177 NMusdes and great Vessels and Nerves of the Thigh, to Ihe upper part of the Os Pubis, to which it is fixed. This part of the Tendon, which was formerly known % the name of Poupart’s, or Fallopius’s, or Ingui- nnal Ligament, forms a curve behind, over the Blood- vvesscls, and therefore is now known by the name of iCh'Ural Arch. Somewhat higher, and farther out, than the Symphy- ssis Pubis, or about an inch and a half in a full-sized /Adult, Poupart’s Ligament divides into an upper and lundcr column. The upper column is fixed to the Symphysis Pubis, land to the Os Pubis of the opposite side. The under oone is twisted or doubled in, and inserted into the up- pper part of the Os Pubis, and Pubal portion of the Li- inea Ilio-pectinca, from the Femoral Vessels, as far as ithc Crest or Tuberosity of the Bone, and forms a firm ■sharp line towards the Abdomen, which constitutes the [posterior edge of the Crural Arch, or forms \\\q ChiraV IRing of GimbernaT, of late so frequently mentioned tby Surgeons. The under column is looser, and more slender in the IFemale than in the Male; and the space between the IFemoral Vessels and the insertion of this part of the ILigament is larger; in consequence of which, Pro'tru-^ ssions of the Bowels happen here more frequently in ’’Women. Where the columns separate, a space of an oval form lis left, about an inch in length in the Male, but less in tthe Female, the direction running upwards and out- ^wards, or somewhat in a line between the Pubis and VoL.

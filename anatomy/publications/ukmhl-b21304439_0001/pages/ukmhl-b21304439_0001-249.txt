Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 197 MUSCLES SITUATED UPON THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE THORAX. Â« Pectoralis Major, vel Pectwalisy vel Sternor Hiimcralis. Origin : From the Sternal half of the Clavicle ; from the fore part of the edge of almost the whole length of the upper and middle Bone of the Sternum, where it is connected with its fellow ; and from the Cartilages of the fifth and sixth Ribs, where it mixes with the Obli- quus Externus. The Fibres fi*om thence converge to- wards the Axilla, where they decussate, and send off a flat twisted Tendon. Insertion: Into the Ridge at the outer edge of the Groove for lodging the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps. Action ; To draw the Arm towards the Sternum. Between the Portions of the Muscle arisinj; from the Clavicle and Sternum, there is a slight separation, in consequence of which these Portions have been consi- dered by some Authors as two distinct Muscles. Pectoralis Minor, Vel Serratus Minor AnticxiSy vel Costo-Coracoidalis. \ Origifi: Tendinous and Fleshy, in a serrated man- ner, from the third, fourth, and fifth Ribs, near their N S Cartilages.

In consequence of which the Marrow is found to be thin and bloody in Children, oily and thick in Adults, and watery in old people. The Marrow, lilce the Fat, when viewed through a Microscope, resembles a cluster of pearls;—'Or it is con- tained in spherical Sacs, upon which Vessels are mi- nutely dispersed,*but from which no Excretory Ducts have been discovered to pass out. It possesses little Sensibility in the sound state; and what it does possess is considered by the latest Authors as belonging rather to its Membranes than to the Mar- row itself. But that this part of the Body is not without Nerves, seems to be proved by the experiments made on the Marrow when the Bones of living Animals are cut, and by the pain a person frequently suffers from Diseases within the Bones. Cartilages. Cartilages are of a ^johite Colour^ of an elastic Substancey and much softer than Bones, in consequence of tlie smaller quantity of Earth entering their composition. The Structure is not so evidently Fibrous as that of Bones, yet, by long Maceration, or by tearing them asunder, a Fibrous disposition is perceptible. Their Vessels are extremely small, though they can be readily injected in Cai’tilages where Bone is beginning to form. The Vessels of the Cartilages of the Joints CD seem

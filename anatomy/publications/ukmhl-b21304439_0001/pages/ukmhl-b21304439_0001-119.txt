The Coiacoid Process, arising from' the Neck of the Bone, and making a curvature forwards, so os to leave a hollow at its root for the passage of the Subscajjularis. The Pomt of this Process, giving origin to Muscles, and to a strong Ligament which passes transversely from its side, to be fixed to the Acromion, for the protection of the Joint. The Inferior Costa and Processes are thick and strong, while the Body is so pressed by its own Muscles, especially in old people, as to become in many parts transparent. The Scapula is joined to the Clavicle by Ligaments of such strength, as only to allow a small degree of mo- tion, and that chiefly of a tw'isting nature; but the .Scapula is so connected by Muscles to the Head, Os Hyoides, Trunk, and Arm, as to have motion up- wards, downwards, and to either side* and through the medium of the Clavicle, to be rolled upon the top of the Sternum, In the Foetus, the Base, Acromion, Coracoid Pro- cess, and Head of the Scapula, are Cartilaginous. The three first are afterwards joined as Epiphyses while the Head, with the Glenoid Cavity, is gradually pro- iliiced from the Body of the Bone.

I The I ' Part L] OF THE BONES. 79 ’ The Transverse Processes, long, slender, and spread ^ I out from the Bone, to give origin to large Muscles, and i: to admit of free motion. Tlie Sjnnous Processes, short, large, and strong, and I placed horizontally, with narrow edges above and be- low, and broad flat sides, giving origin to Muscles of !, great strength. ' The Spinal Canal, larger than in the back, for the ] passage of the^Cords of the Spinal Marrow, which form I the Cauda Equina. In consequence of the thickness of the Intervertebral I Substances, and the situation of the Processes of the Lumbai’ Vertebrae, the motion of this part of the Spine is extensive, though not so much so as in the Neck. FALSE VERTEBRAS. The False Vertebra, composed of the Os Sacrum and Os Coccygis. Os Sacrum. The triangular Form of the Bone, with its pointed under extremity. Thejlat concave anterior Surface, for enlarging the Cavity of the Pelvis. The under and fore part forming a turn, called, by some, the Lesser Angle of this Bone.

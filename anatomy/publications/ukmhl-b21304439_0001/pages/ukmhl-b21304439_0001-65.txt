Part I.J COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. 49 Clinoid Process, lying between, and a little behind, the roots of the anterior Clinoid Processes. Between the anterior Clinoid Processes, a small-point- ed Process frequently juts forwards, to join the Cribri- Ibrm Plate of the Ethmoid Bone, from which it is sometimes called Ethmoid Process. The Temporal Fossee of this Bone, which lodge a share of the Lateral Lobes of the Brain. A Fossa between the anterior Clinoid Processes, where part of the anterior Lobes of the Brain rests. A Depression before the Processus Olivaris, where the conjoined Optic Nerves lie ; and a Fossa on each side of it, %vhere these Nerves are situated, previous to their entering the Orbits. The Fossa Pituitaria, Sella Turccia., Ephippium^ or Turkish Saddle, between the Processus Olivaris, and pos- terior Clinoid Process, for lodging the Glandula Pitui- taria. A Depression, running first upwards, then forwards, upon each side of the posterior Clinoid Process and Sella Turcica, and terminating in a Pit at the root of the anterior Clinoid Process. These Depressions point out the course of the internal Carotid Arteries, when they have entered the Cranium, and previous to their perforating the Dura Matter, to be dispersed upon the Brain. Besides these Impressions, several others may be ob- served, made by Nerves and Vessels leading to or from their respective Holes in the Base of the Cranium.

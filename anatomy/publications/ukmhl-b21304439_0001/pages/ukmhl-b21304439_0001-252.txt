200 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Intercostales Interni. Origin: The same with that of the Externi j but they begin at the Sternum, and run downwards and batic- v/ards, decussating the former Muscles like the strokes of the letter X, and continuing as far as the Angles of the Ribs, from which to the Spine they are wanting. Insci lion In the same manner as the Externi. Portions of the Intercostalcs Interni, near the under part of the Thorax, which pass over one Rib, and ter- minate in the next below it, are called, by Douglas, Costaruni Depressores Proprii. fiction of the In ter costales Interni, as well as of the Externi: To enlarge the Cavity of the Thorax, by ele- vating the Ribs in the time of Inspiration j and the ob- liquity of the one set balancing that of the other, allows them to be raised more immediately upwards. From the obliquity of their Fibres, they are found to possess a greater power in raising the Ribsj than Fibres going in a perpendicular direction. The Intercostales Externi end near the Sternum, and the Interni near the Spine, to admit the ready mo- tion of the Ribs j for, had the former been continued to the Sternum, and the latter to the Spine, the parts of these Muscles supposed to be thus fixed, would of course have become Antagonists to the rest. The Portions called Levatores and Depressores Costa- f-um assist in raising the Ribs, in the same manner as the rest of the Intercostales, Sterno-

Part I-] 61 OF THE BONES. mation of the Orbit, and of the Ethmoid and Sphenoid Sinuses, being hollow within. The Anterior Orbitar Process, the larger of the two, with its upper Surface appearing in the bottom of the Orbit, behind the back part of the Os Planum and Os Maxillare. ' v A No/c/i between the Orbitar Pi'ocesses, forming part of the Foramen Spheno-Palatimmy for the passage of the lateral Nasal Vessels-and Nerves. ■ The Forramen Palatinum Posterius, vel Palato^Maxil- larey at the outer end of tlie Palate-Plate of this Bone, but common to it and the Maxillary Bone, for the transmission of the Palatine Vessels and Nerve. A small Hole frequently observed behind the former, and communicating with it, for the passage of a Branch of the Palatine Nerve. The Foramen Spheno-Maxillare, Lacerim Inferius, or Inferior Orbiiar Fissure, at the under and outer part of the Orbit, and common to the Cuneiform, Maxillary, Malar, and Palate Bones, for lodging Fat belonging to the Eye, and transmitting small Twigs of Vessels and Nerves into the Orbit. The Palate-Plate of this Bone and its Pterygoid Pro- cess are firm and strong; but the Nasal Plate and Or- bitar Process are thin and brittle.

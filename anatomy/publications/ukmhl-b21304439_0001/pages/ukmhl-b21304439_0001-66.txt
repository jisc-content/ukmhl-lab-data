50 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The CHnoid Processes, for the transmission of the Optic Nerves and Ocular Arteries. The Foramina Lacera Supcriora, or Superior Orbitar Fissures, under the anterior Clinoid Processes and their transverse Spinous Parts, for the passage of the Third, Fourih, first part of the Fifth, and the Sixth Pair of Nerves, with the Ocular Veins. The Foramina Lacera arc largest at their inner ends. At their outer extremities they are considerably smaller, and are formed there by the Os Frontis ; hence they may be ranked among the common Holes of the Cra- nium. 'I'he Foramina Rotunda, a little behind the Foramina J.accra, for the passage of the second part of the fifth Pair of Nerves, which are termed also Superior Maxil- lary. The Foramina Ovalia, considerably larger than the Foramina Rotunda, and placed farther back, and more externally, foi^the passage of the third part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, and, commonly, for the passage of the Veins which accompany the principal Arteries of the Dura Mater. The Foramina Spinalia, a little to the outer and back part of the Foramina Ovalia, and in the points of the Spinous Processes, for the transmission of the principal Arteries of the Dura Mater. The Foi'amina Plerygoidea, termed also, after the dis- coverer, Foramina Vidiana, at the roots of the inner Plates of the Pterygoid Processes, for the passage of two reflected Branches of the second part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves.

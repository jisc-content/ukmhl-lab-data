OF THE BONES. Part I.] 65 The Angle of the Jaw at the back part of the Base. Impressions made by the Masseter Muscle, upon the outside of the Angle, and also on the Plate which arises from the back part of the Bone. The PlatCy which rises from the Angle of the Jaw, on each side, running upwards and a little backwards, and terminating in two Processes, termed Condyloid and Cotronoid. The Condyloid or Articidar Process, with an oblong rounded head, covered with Cartilage, and placed al- most transversely upon a Cervix at the upper and back part of the Bone; though, with respect to each other, the Condyles are somewhat oblique, the external extre- mity being directed a little forward. At the under and foiâ€™e part of the Condyle, a Cavity for the insertion of the Pterygoideus Externus. The Coronoid Process, into which the Temporal Muscle is inserted,^a little before the Condyloid Process, and in the natural situation of the Jaw, placed on the inner side of the Zygoma. The Anterior Edge of this Process, forming a Ridge which goes downwards and forwards, terminating at the outside of the Posterior Alveoli. From the inner side of the Coronoid Process, another Ridge seen terminating nearly opposite to the former. To these Ridges, the Membranes of the Gums and Muscles belonging to the Mouth are fixed. The Alveolar Process, and Alveoli, nearly similar to those of the Upper Jaw. Tlie Alveolar Process, extending along the Upper Edge of the Bone, from the Coronoid Process of one VoL, I. ' E side

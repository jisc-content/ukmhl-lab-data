The inner part of the Base having no smooth Sur- face, not being contiguous to any other Bone. From the nature of the Joint, the looseness of the Ligaments, and from the existence of a proper Muscle here, this Bone possesses a larger share of motion than any of the rest. The Metacarpal Bone of the Thumby having the ge- neral resemblance of those of the Fingers, but differing from them in being placed obliquely with respect to the Metacarpal Bones of the Fingers, and in some measure opposing them. This Bone thicker and stronger, but shorter than . those of the Fingers. The Base of this Bone articulated with the Pulley formed by the Trapezium, the Bone appearing to admit of flexion and extension only; but, from the looseness of the Ligaments, enjoying the same kind of motion M'ith Joints formed after the manner of Ball and Socket. The inferior extremity of the Bone, considerably flatter than those of the other Metacarpal Bones. j Fingers. â€˜ The composed each of three Bones ; the three Rows of Bones, taken transversely, termed Phalanges.

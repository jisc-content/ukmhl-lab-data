J28 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartI. 1 behind, where the Tendon of the Tibialis Posticus is placed. Tlie semicircular Cavity^ at the under and outer side of the Tibia, for receiving the under end of the Fibula. Round the edge of the articulating Cavity, the Bone marked by the insertion of the Capsular Ligament. The Tibia has a strong external Table, with a con- i .siderable quantity of spongy substance. j The Articulation of the upper end of the Tibia with j the Os Femoris, is of such a nature as to allow flexion to a gi'eat degree, but the numerous Ligaments fixed here prevent it from being extended beyond a straight line with the Thigh; and then there is no rotation nor lateral motion, though, when the Joint is bent, the Li- gaments are so much relaxed, that the Leg may be made in a small degree to roll, or to turn a little to either side. The Extremities of the Tibia arc Cartilaginous in the Foetus, and become afterwards Epiphyses. Fibula, Placed at the outer side of the Tibia, and by much the smaller of the two Bones, being the most slender Bone, in proportion to its length, of any in the Body. The upper end of the Fibula, formed into a large Heady with a superjicial smooth Cavity towards its inner side, to be articulated with the Tibia, where it is tied by Ligaments of such strength as to allow very little motion. J'he Head of the Fibula, irregular and rough exter- nally,

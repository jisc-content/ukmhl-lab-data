180 COMPENDIUxM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Frequently the Semilunar Edge of the Fascia is in- distinct, the Ilial and Piibal Portions being then con- fusedly united by an intermixture of Tendinous and Cellular Substance. Behind the Great Vessels of the Thigh, part of the Pubal Portion of the Fascia is continued down, to be fixed to the Os Femoris, as far as the place where the Femoral Artery perforates the Triceps Muscle. Obliquus Ascenbens Internus, Vel Obliquus hitemtis Abdominis^ vel Ilio-Abdominalis, Origin : From the back part of the Os Sacrum ;— from the Spinous Processes of the three lowest Lumbar Vertebrae, by a Tendon common to it and the Serratus Posticus Inferior ;—from the whole length of the Spine of the Os Ilium j—and from the inside of Poupaut’s Ligament, at the middle of which it sends off’ the Cre- master. From these Origins the Fibres are disposed in a radiated manner j but the greater part of them run in a slanting direction upwards. At the Linea Semiluna- ris, the Muscle becomes Tendinous, and adheres firm- ly to the Tendon of the Obliquus Externus. Here its Tendon divides into two Layers: the anterior Layer, with the greater part of the inferior portion of the pos- terior Layer, joins the Tendon of the External Oblique, and goes over the Rectus, to be inserted into the whole length of the Linea Alba. The posterior Layer joins the Tendon of the Transversalis, and goes behind the Rectus } and this union is continued down, till it reaches about*

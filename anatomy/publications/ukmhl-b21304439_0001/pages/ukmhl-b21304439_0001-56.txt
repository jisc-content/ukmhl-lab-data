[Paut I, little anterior to iliis another Groove, in which the Oc- cipital Artery runs. nic Glenoid or Artindar Cavity^ behind the root of the Zygoma, of an oblong or somewhat oval form, of great size, and lined w’ith Cartilage, for tlie Articula- tion of the Lower Jaw'. The Glenoid Fissure^ at the back part of this Cavity, and between it and the Pax's Petrosa, and also between the Pars Petrosa and Sphenoid Bone, for the attach- ment of part of the Capsular Ligament of the Articu- lation of the Lower Jaw. A Depression between the Glenoid Fissure and Styloid Process, for lodging a portion of the Parotid Gland. The Thimhle-like Cavity^ ortho JugularFossa^ at the inner side of the root of the Styloid Process, for lodging the lop of the internal Jugular Vein. 'Y\ic Meatus yluditorius ExternuSi—a large Canal, be- tween the Mastoid and Zygomatic Processes, leading inwards and forwards to the Organ of Hearing. Around the external Meatus, a rough Surface, for the connection of the Cartilages and Ligaments of the Ear. The Foyamen Stylo-mastoideumy or Aqueduct of Fallo- pius^ between the Styloid and Mastoid Processes, for the transmission of the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair of Nerves. The Foramen Caroticim^ or Canalis CaroticuSt at the inner and fore part of the Jugular P ossa, and also be- fore and at the inside of the Styloid Pi’ocess, leading upwards, then forwards, through the point of the Pars Petrosa, for the transmission of the internal Carotid Artery

^0 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part h The Frontal Spine, in the middle of the under part of the Bone, formed by tlie coalescence of the inner tables, for the attachment of the Falx of the Dura Mater. In such Skulls as have the Sagittal Suture continued to the Nose, the Frontal Spine docs not appear; the inner Plates, in such cases, not having grown together to form it. The Frontal Furro-jo, extending upwards from the Spine, for lodging the upper part of the superior Lon- gitudinal Sinus of the Dura Mater, and for the attach- ment of the Falx. The Foramen Ccccum at the under part of the Spine, for the reception of a process of the Falx, and of small Blood-vessels which penetrate into the Nose, or to the substance of the Bone. Here also the superior Longi- tudinal Sinus takes its origin. This hole is frequently common to the Frontal and Ethmoid Bones. Tlie Frontal Sinuses, placed behind the inner ends of the Superciliary Ridges, about an inch in height, and somewhat more than that in breadth, andâ€™, in some Skulls, forming Prominences near the root of the Nose. Tlie Walls of the Sinuses, formed by a separation of the Tables of the Bone; there being no Diploe here. The Partition between them placed perpendicularly, and preventing them from having any communication with each other. Their capacities vary much in dilTcrent Subjects, and' they are frequently unequal in size in the same Body. In some they are wanting, which is oftener found to happen in persons having aflat Forehead, and where the Sasittal Suture i? continued to the Nose. In others, they are

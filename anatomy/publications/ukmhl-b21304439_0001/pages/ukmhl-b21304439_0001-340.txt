288 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. The Vertebrae of the Back, fixing these Processes to each otlier. Â« The Capsular LigamenlSj which join the articulating Processes to eacli other. The Posterior or Internal Common Ligament of the Vertebrae, somewhat similar to the anterior one. It begins at the anterior edge of the Foramen Mag- num, and passes along the inner or concave part of the Bodies of the Vertebrae, becoming broader over each of the Intervertebrjil Substances. It adheres firmly to their upper and under edges, and terminates at the lower part of the Os Sacrum. It prevents the Spine from being too much bent forwards. Ligaments of the Ribs. The Capsular Ligaments of the Head of the Ribs, which arise from these Heads, and are fixed to the Cir- cumference of the Pits in the sides of the Bodies of the Vertebrm and Intervertebral Cartilages. The outer part of each Ligament sends off, or is connected with, radiated Fibres which are spread out upon the^ sides of the Vertebrae. The Capsular Ligaments of the Tubercles of the Ribs, which arise round the Articular Pits on the points of the Transverse Processes of the Vertebrae of the Back, and are fixed round the Tubercles of the Ribs. Internal Ligaments of the back of the Ribs, called Ligamenta T7-ajisversaria Interna, which arise from the inferior Surfiices of the Transverse Processes, and are fixed to the superior Margins of the Necks of the near- est Ribs.

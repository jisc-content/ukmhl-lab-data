36 COMrENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The scrtion of the Recti Capitis Lateralcs Muscles; and, anterior to these, the semilunar Notches which form part of the Holes common to the Temjjoral and Occi- pital Bones. The Flexion and Extension of the Head arc perform- ed at the Condyles, but they are found to be placed be- hind its centre of gravity, which affords space for the Mouth, Throat, &c.; and the Head is prevented from falling forwards by the constant action of the strong Ex- tensor Muscles, placed on the back part of the Neck. The intei'Tial Surface of the Bone hoiloâ€™ut.if for contain- ing the back part of the Brain. The Cruciform Spine of the inner side, formed by two Ridges, the one placed perpendicularly in the middle of the Bone, the other crossing the first in an horizontal direction. The upper Limb of the perpendicular Spine hollow in the middle, or frequently at one side, for the reception of the superior longitudinal Sinus, and the attachment of the Falx. The lateral Limbs, placed opposite to the great exter- nal arched Spine, and hollow in the middle, for contain- ing the lateral Sinuses, and giving attachment to the Tentorium Durae Matris. The hollow in one of the lateral Limbs is frequently the continuation of that made in the perpendicular Spine by the longitudinal Sinus, and therefore is often larger than the other. The lower Limb, short, for the attachment of the Falx Minor, and sometimes hollow, for the reception of an Occipital Sinus.

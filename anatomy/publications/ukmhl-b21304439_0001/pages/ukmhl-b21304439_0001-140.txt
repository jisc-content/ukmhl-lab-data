124 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The T\\efore part of the Bone, Jlat^ where it is covered by the Crurens. The Sides of the Bone jlattened at its middle and lower part by the two Vasti. The Linea Aspcra^ or Ragged Ridge, on the back part of the Bone, extending from the Trochanters, but chiefly from the large one, to the lower part of the Bone, and giving attachment to numerous Muscles which pass from the Pelvis to the Thigh, or from the Thigh to the Leg. The Linea Aspera is forked at both its extremities; extending above to the Trochanters, while below, the two lines into which it divides terminate in the Condyles. The Canal for the Medullary Vessels, slanting up- wards, a little below the middle height of the posterior part of the Bone. The undei' and hack part of the Bone jiat, where the Pojjliteal Vessels and Nerves are placed. .The longer End of the Bone becoming gradually en- larged, and perforated by many Holes, for the insertion of the Capsular Ligament of the Knee, and for the pas- sage of the Nutritious Vessels of the Bone. The lower End, also marked by the insertion of seve- ral Muscles. The Cartilaginous Trochlea at the under and fore part of the Bone, placed obliquely, with its outer Sur- face larger and higher than its inner one, to be adapted to the Patella, which moves upon it. The external and internal Condyles, continued back from the Trochlea, and also covered with Cartilage, for the motion of the Tibia.

176 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Serro3 intermix with the Indentations of the Serratas Major Anticus, and the Muscle is commonly connected with the Pectoralis Major, Intercostales, and Latissi- mus Dorsi; the last of which covers the edge of a por- tion of it, extending from the twelfth Rib to the Spine of the Os Ilium, from the anterior half of which it has also part of its origin.—From these attachments the Fibres of the Muscle run obliquely downwards and for- wards, and terminate (sometimes by distinct Indenta- tions) in a broad Tendon, or Aponeurosis, which, near its margin, is firmly connected with the Tendon of the following Muscle, where it forms a curved line, called Linea Semilunaris. From this the Tendinous Fibree are continued in the same direction with the Fleshy Fibres, to the middle of the Abdomen. Insertion: Into its fellow of the opposite side, by the medium of the Linea Alha^ which extends from the Cartilago Ensiformis to the Pubis. This white line is formed by the meeting of the Tendons of the Oblique and Transverse Muscles of the Abdomen, and is perfo- rated in the middle by the Umbilicus—originally a pas- sage for the Umbilical Cord, and now formed into a Cicatrix. The Tendon of this Muscle is strengthened by other Tendons of a more delicate nature, lying upon its outer Surface, which decussate it, in a curveil direction, up- wards and inwards. The under part of the Tendon, thicker and stronger than the rest of it, extends from the superior-anterior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium, over the Flexor Muscles

1-4- COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. cqiml, while the Pars Petrosa is thick and strong, but irregular, having within it several Cavities, Processes, and Bones, which belong to the Organ of Hearing. In a Foetus, the Squamous is separated from the Pe- trous part by a Fissure; there is no appearance of Mas- toid or Styloid Process, and instead of an Osseous Mea- tus Externus, there is only a Ring of Bone, in which the Mcmbraiia Tympani is fixed. I Os Etiimoides. Observe here, The Sifuaiiori of the Ethmoid, or Cribriform Bone, in the fore part of the Base of the Cranium. Its Cuboid Figure. The Cribriform Platen from which the Bone has its name, placed horizontally, and perforated, excepting at its back part, with many Holes, placed irregulaa-ly and of different sizes, for the transmission of the Branches of the First or Olfactory Pair of Nerves. In the recent Subject, these Holes are so much filled up by the Processes of the Dura Mater which inclose the Nerves, that they are much less evident than in Bones where the Membranes have been removed. The Crista Gallic arising perpendicularly from the middle of the Cribriform Plate, and highest at the upper and fore part. To the Edge of this Process, and to the unimperfo- rated part of the Cribriform Plate, the Falx of the Dura Mater is fixed. A Notch at the fore part of the Root of the Crista Gain,

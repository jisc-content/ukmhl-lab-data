I'he external Surface convex^ and smooth at the upper part. The large Arched Ridge, running across the Bone, near the middle of the convex Surface, to the centre of which the Trapezii Muscles are fixed, the outer parts giving origin to the Occipito-frontalis. The smaller Arch, half-way between the former and the passage termed Foramen Magnum, The deptessions between the middle of the large and small Arches, for the connection of the Complexi Muscles.

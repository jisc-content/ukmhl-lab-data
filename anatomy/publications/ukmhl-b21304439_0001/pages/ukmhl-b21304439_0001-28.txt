]2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. seem entirely to exclude the red Blood. No Anatomist has been able to inject them, and Madder, mixed with the food of Animals, does nof change their colour as it does that of Bones. No Nerves can be traced to them; nor do they possess any sensibility in the sound state. Y^et the Granulations which rise on the surface of Carti- lages after Amputation at the Joints arc very sensible. Upon their surface there is a thin Membrane, termed Perichondrium., which, in Cartilages supplying the place of Bone, as in those of the Ribs, or at the ends of the long Bones in Children, is a continuation of the Perios- tetwiy and serves the same general purposes to Cartilage as the Periosteum does to Bone. The Perichondrium of Cartilages which supply the place of Bone, or by their flexibility possess a degree of motion, has Blood-vessels, which, like those of the Pe- riosteum, can be injected. But the Vessels of this Membrane belonging to other Cartilages, particularly those covering the Articular Cartilages, cannot be in- jected. Upon the surface of Aj-ticular Cartilages, the Peri- chondrium is a Pejlcction of the inner surface of the Capsular Ligament, and is so very thin, and adheres so closely, as to appear like part of the Cartilage itseE They have no internal Cavity, nor Cancelli, nor in- ternal Membrane, for lodging Marrow ; their weight is nearly a third less than that of Bone. Their texture is less changed by acids; but a much greater proportion of them than of Bones is destroyed by the action of a strong fire. They are softened by maceration in Water; and

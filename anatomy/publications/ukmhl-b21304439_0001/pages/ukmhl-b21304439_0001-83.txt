Part I.] OF THE BONES. 67 Between the Posterior Maxillary Foramen and the angle, the Bone marked by the insertion of the Internal Pterygoid Muscle. The Anterior Maxillary Foramen^ or Mental Holey at the side of the Chin, where the remains of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve and Vessels come outi The Inferior Maxillaiy Canal, running in the sub- stance of the Bone, between the Posterior and Anterior Foramina, a little below the roots of the Teeth, and having many perforations, for the passage of small branches of Vessels and Nerves which supply the Jaw and Teeth. The Tables of the Jaw, remarkably thick, compact, and hard, and within, furnished with numerous Cells, which surround the Maxillary Canals. The Artiadation of the Jaw by its Condyloid Pro- cess with the Glenoid Cavity of the Temporal Bone, and also with the Tubercle at the root of its Zygomatic Process. An Intermediate moveable Cartilage, placed in the Ar- ticulation of the Lower Jaw, in its gentler motion al- lowing the Condyle to remain in the Glenoid Cavity, but admitting it to advance upon the Tubercle or root of the Zygoma, when the Mouth is widely opened. In the Foetus, the Lower Jaw is somewhat of a semi- circular figure, and is composed of two Pieces, joined together in the middle of the Chin by the intervention, of a Cartilage. This Union, termed Symphysis, gra- dually ossifies, and leaves no mark of any former di- vision. TEETH. E2

Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS, &c: ^ S09 tions of the Leg in the extended state, but admit of a small degree of botl^ when the Limb is bent. The Posterim' Ligament of Winslow, formed of ir- regular Bands which arise from the upper and back part . of the external Condyle of the Os Femoris, and descend obliquely over the Capsular Ligament, to be fixed to the Tibia under the inner and back part of its Head. It pre- vents the Leg from being pulled farther forwards than to a straight line with the Thiffh, and also furnishes a convenient situation for the be<2[innin£;s of the Gastrocne- raius and Plantaris Muscles. \\lien this Ligament is wanting, which is sometimes ‘ the case, its place is supplied by a Mejnbranoiis ^xpan- ■ sion. The Ligament of the Patella, which arises from a De- pression behind the Apex of that Bone, and is fixed to the Tuberosity of the upper and fore part of the Tibia. By the intervenrion of this Ligament, the Muscles in- serted into the Patella are enabled to extend the Leg. The Capsular Ligament, which aeees from the whole Circumference of the under end of the 'I high-bone, some way above the Margin of the Articulating Carti- lage, and above the posterior part of the great Notch between the Condyles. From this it descends to be fix- ed round the Head of the Tibia, and into the whole Margin of the Arti(^ating .Surface of the Patella, in such a manner that the Patella forms part of the Cap- sule of the Joint. The Capsular Ligament is of itself remarkably thin, but so covered by the Ligaments already mentioned, by the general Aponeurosis of the Limb, and by' the Ten- U 3 dons

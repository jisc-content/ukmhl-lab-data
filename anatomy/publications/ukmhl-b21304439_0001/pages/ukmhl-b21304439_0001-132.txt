116 COMPENDIUM'OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Os Unciforme, placed in the under and inner part of the Wrist. The u])per and innc^' Surfacej articulated with the 0Â« Cuneiforme. The outet' Surface, articulated with the Os Magnum. The infei'ior Surface, opposed to the Metacarpal Bones of the Ring and Little Fingers. The anterior Surface, sending out the Unciform Pro- cess, which gives name to the Bone. The Unciform Process, curved for the passage of the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers. The Articulation between the first and second Row of Carpal Bones allows motion to each side, but chiefly forwards and backwards; the motion, however, is less extensive than between the Fore-arm and Wrist. Tlie Connection between the different Bones in each Row, is of such a nature as not to admit of any sensible motion. The Substance of the Carpal Bones is spongy, but strong in proportion to their size. The Carpus serves as a Base to the Hand, protects its Tendons, &c. and affords free and extensive motion, i In the Foetus, the Bones of the Carpus are in a Car- tilaginous state. Metacarpus, Consisting of four Bones for supporting the Fingers, and one for the Thumb. t 6 Mdacarpal

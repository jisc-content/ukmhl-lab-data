The Q'ucial Inierveitebral Ligaments, which are nu- merous and short, but strong, situated behind the Liga- • mentum Commune Anterius; crossing each other ob- liquely, they join the Bodies of the Vertebrae together, upon tlie outer edges of the Intervertebral SubsUmccs, to which also they firmly adhere. I l^he Intei-vertcbral Substances, (already described along . with the Bones), which join the Bodies of the Vertebrm together, and allow an yielding motion in all directions. These substances are so compressible as to yield to the weight of the upper part of the Body j so that, after having been in an erect posture through the course of the day, the height of a person in the prime of life, and of middle stature, is diminished from half an inch to an inch in the evening, but, after a night’s rest in the usual attitude, it is found to be restored. I’lie Ligaments which run from the edge of the Bony !' Arch and Spinous Process of one Vertebra to that of j the next, so as to assist in filling up the Interstices, and i in fixing the Vertebrm tooether. O O ! A Ligamentous Cord which fixes rhe points of the Spinous Processes together. The Cervical Ligament, termed Ligumentmn Xuclue, vel Colli, w'hich arises from the perpendicular Spine of the Occipital Bone, and descends on the back-part of the Neck, adhering to the Spinous Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae, and giving oi’igin to part of the Trapezius.

88 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartI. the Bone, to form, with a similar Ridge of the Os Ilium, the Linca Ilio-jpectincay Briniy or upper opening of the Pelvis. That part of the Brim of the Pelvis which is formed by this Bone, is described by some Authors as being sometimes so shaiâ€™p, as to injure the parts which lie im- mediately contiguous to it. Another Ridge^ from the former, extending down- wards and backwards towards the breach in the fore part of the Acetabulum. A Cavity below these Ridges, for the origin of the Pcctineus. At the upper and outer part of the Foramen Thy- roideum, the Bone having a tvoisted appeara7ice, and a Notch which is formed into a Hole in the Subject, by the addition of the Obturator Ligament, for the pas- sage of the Obturator Vessels and Nerves. The inner end of the Bone, rough and unequal^ but covered with a Ligamentous Cartilage, which, in fresh Bones, joins the two Ossa Pubis so firmly together, as to prevent them from moving upon each other. The inner part of the Bone is broad, and depressed, before, where it gives origin to part of the Adductor Muscles of the Thigh. The inner part of the Bone becoming narrower, and ending in the Crus^ which goes downwards to join the Crus of the Os Ischium, and form, along with that Crus, one side of the Arch of tlie Pubis. The Foramen Thyroidcum, formed by the Os Pubis and Os Ischium, and in the Subject, filled by a Mem- branous Ligament, excepting at the Notch above men- tioned,

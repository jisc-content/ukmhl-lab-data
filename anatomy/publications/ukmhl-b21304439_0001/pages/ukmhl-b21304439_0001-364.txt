S12 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. Ligament? Ligaments connecting the Fibula to the Tibia. The Capsular Ligament of the superior extremity of the Fibula, which ties it to the outer part of the Head of the Tibia, and which is strengthened by the external Lateral Ligament of the Knee, and by the Tendon of the Biceps which is fixed to the Fibula. The Interosseous Ligament., one edge of which is fixed to the Ridge or Angle at the outer and back part of the Tibia, the other to the corresponding Ridge at the in- ner side of the Fibula. It fills the space between the Tibia and Fibula, like the Interosseous Ligament of the Fore-arm, and is of a similar structure, being formed of oblicjue Fibres, and perforated in various places for the passage of Vessels and Nerves. At its upper part there is a large Opening, where the Muscles of the opposite sides are in contact, and where Blood-vessels pass to the fore part of the Leg. It serves chiefly for the Origin of part of the Muscles â– which belong to the Foot, and thereby supplies the place of Bone. The Ligaments of the inferior extremity of the Fibula, which are called Anterior-supanor, and Posterior-supe^ rior, according to their situations, arising from the edges of the Semilunar Cavity of the Tibia, and fixed to the jMalleolus Externus of the Fibula. The Ligaments between the ends of the Tibia and Fi- . hula join the two Bones so firmly together, as to admit of no sensible motion.

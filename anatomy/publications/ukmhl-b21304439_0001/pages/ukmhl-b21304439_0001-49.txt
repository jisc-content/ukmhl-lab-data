OF THE BONES. 33 Part I.] VoL. I. C The Mater ; tlie principal of which begin by a Trunk at the under and fore part of the Bone, where frequently a full Canal is formed. • ' In their progress upwards, the Furrows divide'into many branches, and frequently small passages are seen running from these into the Oiploe. The dcpressimi at the upper Edge of the Bone, for the attachment of the upper part of the Falx, and lodge- ment of the superior longitudinal Sinus. This is most distinctly seen when the Bones are conjoined. The depression for the longitudinal Sinus, like the Sinus itself, becomes large in its coiu’se backwards j and frequently it is larger in one Bone than the other. The Fossa at the under and back part of the Bbhe, for lodging a small part of the lateral Sinus. Numerous dejn essions found on the inside of the Bone, occasioned by the prominences of the Brain. The connection of the Parietal Bones to the Os Fronds by the Coronal, and to each other by the Sa- gittal Suture. The Parietal Bones have the two Tables and Diploe the completest, and are the most equal and smooth of any of the Cranium. In the Foetus, the sides of the Parietal Bones are in- complete, and there is no Parietal Hole. Between the Parietal Bones and the middle of the divided Os Fron- tis, there is a large interstice, termed, in common lan- guage, o'peningqf the Head, and by Anatomists, Bregma, Foils, or Fontanella, from its having been supposed by the Ancients, that through it the superfluous Humours of the Brain are evacuated.

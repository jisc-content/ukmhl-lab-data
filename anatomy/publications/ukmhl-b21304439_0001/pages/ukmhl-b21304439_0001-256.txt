204 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PAnxII. running transversely, pull it backwards; and the infe- rior Fibres ascending, depress it. The whole acting together, bring it immediately back.â€”When the Sca- pula is fixed, the Muscle assists in moving the Head backwards. Latissimus Dorsi, vel Lumbo~Humeralis. Origin: By a broad Tendinous Expansion, from the posterior part of the Spine of the Os Ilium ; from all the Spinous Processes of the Vertebraj extending be- tween the under end of the Os Sacrum and sixth Dorsal Vertebra, and, by three or four Tendinous or Fleshy Slips, from an equal number of inferior Ribs. The Tendon by degrees changes into a Muscle of great breadth, the inferior Fibres of which run upwards and outwards, and the superior transversely over the inferior Angle of the Scapula, receiving a small Slip from it in their way to the Axilla, where the Fibres of the Muscle in general are collected, twisted, and folded, like tliose of the Pectoralis Major. Insertion : By a strong thin Tendon, into the inner edge of the Groove for lodging the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps. Action: To pull the Arm downwards and backw^ards, and to roll the Os Humeri inwards, by which tire Palm of the Hand is made to face backwards. When the Pectoralis Major acts at the same time with this one, the Arm is brought immediately down towards the Trunk. The Latissimus Dorsi and Pectoralis Major form the ' , Axilla,

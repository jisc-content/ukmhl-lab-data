Part I.J OF THE BONES. 27 The bits and Root of the Nose, between the Frontal, Ma- lar, Sphenoid, Ethmoid, Superior Maxillary, and Na- sal Bones. The Zygomatic Sutures, placed between the Temporal and Cheek Bones, and slanting obliquely downward^ and backwards. 'Ihe advantages derived from the Cranium being form- ed of different Bones and Sutures are, that the Spheroi- dal figure is sooner completed ;—that the Bones, which are at some distance from each other at birth, yield, and conduce to an easier Delivery;—that the Dura Mater, by the Sutures, has a firmer adhesion;—and that Frac- tures are frequently prevented from extending so far as they would do in one continued bony substance. OF THE SEPARATE BONES OF THE HEAD. Os Frontis. The principal things to be attended to in this Bone are. The Situation of the Os Frontis in the fore part of the Cranium. Its Shape, which has been compared to that of a Clam-shell. Its External Surface smooth, and above convex. The external and internal Angular, or Orhitar Pro^ cesses, forming part of the Orbits.

9 of the simplicity of Nature's works,—here that simplicity is fully ex- empted. These limbs consist of the same parts, their materials are identical; yet, as we have seen, they execute different functions, and so may be considered as different organs, which is sufficiently indi- cated by the different names by which they are popularly known. And all this is effected by one portion being largely developed, a contiguousone being less so,—some being evolved toamaximum, whilst others are left rudimentary, as if nature were sparing of her materials, yet profuse in the results she would elaborate out of them :—And this is what we really mean when we speak of the simplicity of Nature's works, as contrasted with* the grandeur and comprehensiveness of her designs. I would fain carry your attention with me yet a little farther, for the purpose of giving you a' coup dyceil view of the structure of Man and Animals. When we have surveyed and inspected attentively the different divisions of the Animal Kingdom, and examined the structure of its different Orders, say from the Fishes up to the Mammi- ferae, we see that, though variously modified, the proximate or anato- mical constituents of the members (as in the instances cited,) and also of the trunk, are analogous. Now, whilst we pass from link to link in this great chain, if the mind dwells sufficiently long on each of the Natural Families which it connects, to retain an impression of its fun- damental form, omitting the minor traits which give to each its indi- viduality; if, in a word, as it passes from the lowest to the highest, it retains that which is essential in the form and composition of each, abstracting its peculiarities, it will gradually ascend to the con- templation of a form, which will be a Type or Representative of all, divested of the peculiarities which mark each of them. Having thus ascended to the contemplation of a Type, or abstract Form, which may be conceived to contain within it the components, or anatomical ele- ments, of each of the Natural Families, (Fishes, Reptiles, Birds, Mammalia,) but yet stripped of the peculiarities of figure which characterize them respectively;—having arrived at such a form, I say, and retained it for a while before the mind's eye, so as to fix the impression of it, we may readily reverse this mental process, and proceed to evolve the Model which is thus present to the mind, c

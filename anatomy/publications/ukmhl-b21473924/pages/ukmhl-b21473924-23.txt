15 sion to which the study of Anatomy and Zoology, if fairly conducted, will always lead : it was to indicate this result that I called your alientiou to this subject, and also to shew you that the study of the structure of animals did not consist in dry details or useless minutiae; and, moreover, that the appearance, of complexity and difficulty, which it presents at a first view, ceases, or is greatly diminished, by having a clue to guide your steps and direct the course of your enquiries; and in proportion as complexity and difficulty are removed from the pursuit, will a taste and a liking for it spring up. Until very lately, the study of loology and comparative anatomy was greatly neglected by our professional brethren: they appear to have regarded it as something fitted to employ light minds, or occupy hours of leisure and amusement. A slight examination, however, would suffice to shew, that the facts it unfolds are not merely interest- ing,—that they are instructive in the highest degree, as they tend to throw considerable light on several obscure points connected with the anatomy of the human body, by affording the means of comparing the composition, arrangement, and properties of its different organs^ with the corresponding parts in other animals. Whatever removes ob- scurity or doubt enlarges the boundaries of knowledge, and lessens the dominion of error and ignorance; so whatever increases our knowledge of the structure of the human body, necessarily elucidates its functions* and throws a light on those derangements of structure and function which constitute disease. I now direct your attention to another topic not less attractive or interesting,—I mean those organs by which we maintain our relations with the world aroutid us. By the Taste and Touch we learn some of the ordinary properties of different substances; by the Ear we recog- nize all the shades and varieties of change impressed by sounding bod ies on the atmosphere, and appreciate their characters by means of the impressions which are conveyed to the sentient extremities of the nerves. The Eye makes us acquainted with other properties of bodies, more particularly their colour, which, but for its assistance, would remain for ever unknown to us; but it is not merely of the existence or of the properties of things in our immediate vicinity that wc are apprised by this wondrous inlet to knowledge, its field of view extends

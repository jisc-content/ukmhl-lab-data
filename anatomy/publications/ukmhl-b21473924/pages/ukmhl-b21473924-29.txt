21 here present on litis occasion there are many who will as fully realize the expectations which their friends entertain of Ihein, and that whenever in after-life they shall look back on the time spent amongst us, it will be with the pleasurable recollection of having steadily de- voted it to the acquisition of professional, as well as general, attain- ment. At your entrance into this place, I feel anxious to impress upon you, as a principle for your guidance, that you are no longer to consider yourselves merely as pupils; you should consider yourselves as professional gentlemen, assembled here as in a place of study, where you are to acquire that knowledge, and those attainments, which are necessary for the discharge of the duties of that profession to which you have devoted yourselves. Knowledge, no matter how extended and various it may be, will not ensure success or conciliate esteem unless it be supported by principle and conduct. You come here to acquire professional knowledge, 1 trust you will be not only assiduous in that pursuit, but also punctilious in the observance of all the pro- prieties of professional conduct. As to the relation which is about to spring up between us, I should wish to consider it not as that between master and pupil, so much as that which should exist between senior and junior, assuming both to be guided by strictly professional principles; and, as to rank or station, I, for my own part, ask for none, covet none, am ambitious of none, save that which acquirement and conduct can ndver fail to vindicate for themselves either here or elsewhere.

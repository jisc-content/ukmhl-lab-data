17 litigated questions. Judging from what we feel in ourselves, or what we know of our personal identity, we should perhaps consider the brain as a unit or single organ, which ministers to the general pur- poses of innervation; I use that term in an extended meaning, as including, within its comprehension, all those properties and endow- ments, whatever they be, which flow from, and are dependent on, nervous influence. But were we to look at it in another point of view, were we to trace its varieties of conformation in the animal series, and, at the same time, note the steps of its development in man from the first moment of conception to its full evolution, we perhaps would be disposed to consider it, not as a unit or single organ, but as an aggregate of units or single organs, each ministering to a distinct function, and all conspiring to a common end,â€”the innervation of the subject. These different parts, then, of the animal economy, present, as a subject for investigation, sufficient inducements to engage the attention of inquiring minds; but it is not as a matter of inquiry, or of curiosity, that you engage in such pursuits, it is with a view to make practical applications of the knowledge you acquire, when you enter on the duties of your profession. In this point of view, the study of the structure and functions of the human body becomes the pivot on which all your pursuits turn, and to which all your inquiries must have a reference. The sphere of your usefulness is wide and extended, it embraces all the physical ills "which flesh is heir to :" every form of the infinite malady is included within your province, and submitted to your direction; and no matter whether any particu- lar case that is presented to you, be slight in its degree, or short in its duration; no matter whether it be a fancied ill or a real disease, the one is not the less real to the mind and feeling of the sufferer, or the other a less serious disturbance of his health and his comfort; all equally demand your care and attention, without any distinction as to their cause, their duration, or degree. To acquire the knowledge necessary to discharge such important duties, and fulfil such serious trusts, is the proper end and aim of all your pursuits whilst here; and surely, the information and discretion necessary for purposes at once so various and complex, cannot be slight or common-place.

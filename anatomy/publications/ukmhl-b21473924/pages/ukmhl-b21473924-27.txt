19 even to their ultimate termination in the air-cells. If we could just imagine the one to be drawn out from the interior, and the other peeled off, like the rind from a fruit, we should leave insulated, what the older anatomists termed the parenchyma of the organ. Now, observation has shown that either of these three component parts maybe inflamed separately, the others remaining unaffected; and pathologists have remarked the inflamed condition of these textures by distinct names, the one being called Pleuritis, the other Bron- chitis, the third Pneumonia. The serous membrane, when inflamed, will present a certain set of characters, go through a series of changes, and exhibit a train of phenomena in its anatomical charac- ters, as well as in the symptoms which arise, as widely different from those presented by the mucous membrane, under similar circum- stances, as if these textures did not belong to the same organ. But, i f weexamine the progress of inflammation in the peritoneum, in the arachnoid, or in the serous lamella of the pericardium, and compare its characters and symptoms with those presented by the pleura, we shall find the most striking similitude, though these membranes are placed in different cavities, and enter into the composition of organs, which minister to perfectly distinct functions. As, in consequence of their striking similarity in structure, properties, and anatomical characters, these membranes are ranged under one head, and form one class, so their diseases should also form one group; on the obvious principle, that the more close the similitude between parts in their structure, functions, and characters, in health, the more nearly will they resemble one another in the. changes induced by disease. These considerations at once point out the necessity of applying the principle of analysis, aided by experiment and observation, to the study of anatomy; they indicate also a mode of arranging diseases according to a natural method, by grouping them together according to their mutual affinities, and thereby introducing into medicine those rigorous methods of investigation, which have already effected so much for other departments of natural science. When the structure of the body is investigated, in reference to practical Surgery, a different method is pursued. The body is con- sidered as divisible, not into elementary textures, but into separate

22 LECTURE ON THE STUDY OF PHYSIOLOGY. Having at our meeting, yesterday, presented to you some general views of the structure of Man and Animals, I shall to-day otter some remarks on the second section of our course, or that which treats of Physiology. Physiology means literally a discourse on Nature; so that when taken in the original signification of the term, it included within its comprehension the whole range of Natural Science ; it is now, how- ever, confined to that department of it, which treats of the various phenomena of living beings; the laws which preside over Ihem, and the agencies by wliicli^ their existence is, in the first instance, deter- mined, as well as those by which it is subsequently maintained. In short, it is the science of life, in all its various forms, and as such has been called " Biology." You are aware that anatomy is usually divided into two compartments, human and comparative. Physiology is similarly divided. This does not arise from any thing in the nature of the subject; the laws of life, the principles of orga- nization are the same in all animated beings, however modified they may be in the conditions of their existence. The division appears to have been adopted merely as a matter of convenience, for to investi- gate' such a subject thoroughly in all its details and bearings, much less to make efforts towards extending its boundaries, would far ex- ceed the power of ordinary individuals. This defect of our constitu- tion can only be remedied] by acting on the principle of the division of labour, as the only means of attaining an adequate degree of precision and minuteness in details so varied and complete. 1 (I

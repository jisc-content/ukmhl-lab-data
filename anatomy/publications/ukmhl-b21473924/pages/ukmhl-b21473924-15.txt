7 ficial depression on which it moves, and so admits, attlie shoulder, the utmost variety and latitude of movement; the bones of the Fore-arm too are calculated for flexibility and motion, one rolling on the other, and both fitted with a perfect apparatus of muscles or moving powers, which, with the utmost ease and precision, turn the Wrist, and guide the Hand to any object to which it is to be applied. The bones, then, in arrangement and general plan, are similar, yet, by slight modifi- cations, are fitted for totally different purposes. The Hand and the Foot [2, 1,] agree in the elements of which they are composed, and in the number of them ; but they are de- veloped so differently in each, that they form totally distinct Mem- bers, and serve for widely different purposes. The solid and the moveable parts in each are strongly contrasted; the pieces which compose the solid part of the Foot [fig. 1 d] are strong and large, those of the Hand [2 d*~] are comparatively diminutive, but the Fingers, or flexible part [/*], are largely developed, as compared with the Toes [1,/]. It is commonly said that this arises merely because the Toes are less necessary for support and progression than the rest of the Foot, whilst the Fingers are more necessary for pre- hension.and adjustment than the rest of the Hand ; it would be more correct to say that it is the result of a general law which pervades the whole Animal Kingdom,â€”a law which establishes what may be termed a principle of compensation, by virtue of which, if any given part is increased above par, its increase is effected at the expense of some other; or, as it has been technically expressed, if the " forma- tive effort" be strongly directed to one part, it will be less so to some neighbouring one. The arch of the foot is the more important part in reference to its general purpose of sustaining the body, the Toes being obviously less so as a means of support or progression. It is just the reverse in the Hand : the Fingers, or flexible part, being the more important one, in reference to the various purposes which the Hand has to perform, and therefore they are proportionally evolved or developed. Again, when we direct our attention to a single part of the Hand, viz. the Thumb [2 x], and contrast it with the corresponding part of the Foot [1 x], we see how a new instrument is produced by a mere

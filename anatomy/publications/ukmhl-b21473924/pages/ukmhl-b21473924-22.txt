14 determine the description of the teeth to which they helonged, and reciprocally we can determine the other bones by the teeth. It may be said, that though we may from such data infer the class or natural family to which an animal belonged, we could not fix with any precision its genus or species; we can, however, ascertain both, by going a little more minutely into its structure. Confining our attention still to the instance already cited, the Carnivorous animals, we find that each species has special aptitudes to fit it for the peculiar sort of animals on which it is to support itself, so that its minute conformation will vary according to the size, habits, and haunts of its prey. We can therefore trace in every part of it a general plan or outline which determines its class and order, and next, a number of minute modifications which fix the genus, and even the species. Thus a person who is well acquainted with the laws of organization, by commencing with a single bone, may sketch out or re-construct the whole animal to which it belonged." Such were the principles which Cuvier brought to bear on the various questions which arose out of the examination of the Fossil remains of animals, and by which he was enabled to class and arrange them with as much precision as if he had their entire skeletons before him, and from which he has deduced so many important inferences with regard to the changes which the earth's surface has undergone during its different revolutions. We have in this way presented to our view a subject which comprises a variety of details sufficient for the most scrutinizing enquirer; and, at the same time, sufficiently extended to engross the powers of a mind the most comprehensive. The Anatomist sees before him a number of subjects inviting the most minute research; the Physiologist observes a series of adaptations of means to end, of structure to function, which point at every step of his progress to evidences of forethought and of knowledge; the Zoologist traces the unity of design which pervades the whole scheme of animated nature, from which he cannot fail to infer a unity alike in the design and the Designer, whose attributes, as traceable in all his works, are wisdom and power, with the adjunct of infinity in each. This is the conclu-

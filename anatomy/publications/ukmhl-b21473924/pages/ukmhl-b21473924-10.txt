2 that we were treating of details, omitting principles, and accumulating facts without order or method. Few pursuits comprise a greater variety of details than Anatomy; none can exhibit a greater number of facts, all bearing more or less directly on the duties of an arduous profession; and, if its study be not conducted with method, if at each step of your progress you do not see the object for which these facts are collected, and learn the applications which should be made of them, your minds would soon become oppressed by a load of detail, and would be repelled from the pursuit by its complexity, instead of feeling an interest awakened by the nature of the inquiries which it every moment suggests. Medicine, in reference to which Anatomy is generally cultivated, has been justly termed "a science of observation;" and Anatomy has, not unaptly, been named "a science of facts,"—facts with which we seek to become acquainted, not merely because they serve to explain the structure of the human body, or because they lead us to a knowledge of the uses of its different parts, but because of the light which they shed on the seat, the nature and causes of disease,—a light, without which, Medicine would be little else than a blind empiricism. The views and purposes for which a particular pursuit is studied, and the motives and arguments that may be adduced to incite others to its cultivation, must necessarily be as various as are the degrees of information possessed by different individuals, the extent of their acquirements, or the quantity of their acquaintance with the subject. Thus, one person studies Anatomy as a branch of natural science, another, for the light which it throws on the seat and nature of diseases, whilst a third descends as low as a reasoning being can descend in his estimate of a subject of serious concernment, when he avows that he studies it because it is one of the legal requisites for the practice of Medicine. This motive is not confined to a few; its influence, I fear, extends to many, manifesting its effects on the tenor of their studies in early life, and subsequently on their professional character and prospects. When an opinion has once sprung up that the main object of a man's ambition is attained when he is fitted to pass through a particular ordeal, many individuals will be disposed to rest

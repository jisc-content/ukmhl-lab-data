25 on llie assumption, that at some remote period or other, far hack, no doubt, in the dimness of time, there arose from an accidental concur- rence of particles of matter a Moss, or a Lichen, which as it mould- ered to decay gave origin to a group of Miles, Rotiferae, or other minute animalculse, and that these in process of time assumed new forms, ascending in the scale of being, and becoming, from generation to generation, more and more perfect;â€”the Zoologist, in assuming all this, overlooks the unanswerable objections to such a system that may be deduced from history, which supplies abundant evidence to prove that the form, size, and structure of all the Animals of which we have any knowledge were just as perfect some thousand years ago as they are at this day. And, moreover, that we never have traced or noted any tendency in individuals or in species to ascend in the scale of Animals, or to become more perfect from being less so; and, finally, that the physical and intellectual characters of Man were as fully de- veloped three thousand years ago, (the period at which authentic history begins,) as they are at the present hour. This theory, which goes on the assumption that the different species of more perfect Animals are derived from the less perfect, was advo- cated by Lamarck, and gained a great many converts, so much so that Cuvier felt himself called onto combat it with all the powers of his eloquence, and all the resources of his knowledge. Lamarck laid great stress on the influence which time may be supposed to exert in ef- fecting changes in the form and condition of animals ; but, what time may produce in the mind of a theorist is one thing, what it has ac- tually produced according to the testimony of history is quite another. If we appeal to history and authentic records on this point, we shall find them decisive of the question. You are aware that the Egyptians were accustomed to confer what may be termed an earthly immor- tality on their friends, by embalming their remains. The superstition in which they were immersed prompted them to pay a similar tribute of respect to several inferior animals. In their tombs and catacombs, even at the present day, may be found Mummies of dogs, cats, birds of prey, monkeys, and crocodiles, which differ no more from the kindred species now existing in the same country, than the Mum- mies of the human species differ from the skeletons of men of the E

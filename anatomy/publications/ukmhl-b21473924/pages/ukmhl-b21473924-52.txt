42 deduce genera! principles from inadequate data; others are referribte to that proneness which persons evince when entering on speculations concerning the phenomena of life, and the functions of living beings to carry with them, and even rigorously apply, notions and princi- ples taken from such pursuits as had previously, and perhaps exclu- sively engaged their attention. Hence it is that the Philosophers of old *'introduced into medicine their peculiar hypotheses; the Heathen priests tinctured it with their superstitious rites, whilst, in more modern times, the Mechanists sought to explain the functions of the body in health, and its derangement in disease, by principles deduced from hydraulics, and the Chemists referred them to the affi- nities which govern the processes they were wont to observe in their laboratories. " From whence/' said Bacon, when discoursing of the speculative systems which obtained in another department of science, (t from whence can arise such vagueness and sterility in all the physical systems which have hitherto existed in the world ? It is not cer- tainly from any thing in Nature itself; for the steadiness and regu- larity of the laws by which it is governed, clearly mark them out as objects of certain and precise knowledge; neither can it arise from any want of ability in those who have pursued such inquiries, many of them have been men of the highest talent and genius of the ages in which they lived, and it can therefore arise from nothing else than the perverseness and insufficiency of the methods that have been pursued. Men have sought to make a world from their own con- ceptions, and to draw from their own minds all the materials they employed; but if, instead of doing so, they had consulted experience and observation, they would have had facts, not opi- nions, to reason about, and might have ultimately arrived at a knowledge of the laws which govern the material world. As things are conducted at present, a sudden transition is made from sensible objects and particular facts, to general propositions, which are accounted principles, round which, as round so many fixed poles, disputation and argument continually revolve. From propositions thus hastily assumed, all things are derived by a process compendious and precipitate, ill-suited to discovery, but

i moral regeneration, it would be a singular anomaly if the mem- bers of a profession (usually designated as liberal and learned,) were alone to remain inactive. Connected as we are with every grade and condition of men, observing their pursuits, noting their opinions and the impulses which guide them, we cannot fail to be influenced by any decided impressions that are made upon them; and, whenever the tide of improvement or of change sets strongly in any particular di- rection, we cannot avoid being borne on with the current. At the present day, when the different ranks and classes of the community are com- bining to carry on the work of improvement, by forming institutions for the diffusion of knowledge, by collecting libraries and establishing lectures,—as members of the great social family we necessarily take part in these undertakings; but does the same spirit animate us as members of a learned profession? If it does not, the rank and sta- tion hitherto conceded to professional men, in consequence of the education they have received, and of the superior knowledge they were supposed to possess, will be denied to us. If we alone remain stationary, whilst all around us is in a state of progressive improve- ment;—if we alone remain fixed to one point in the intellectual scale, whilst the rest of the community is ascending, we will serve at least one purpose, though that is not a very creditable one, that of enabling the attentive observer, by comparing our apathy with the activity of others, to measure how far the. tide of improvement has flowed on. But this, I am sure, can never take place: if no better motive impels us, the spirit of rivalry cannot fail to act as an incen- tive, and that incentive is now applied from a quarter which we could never have anticipated. I have just alluded to the efforts and combinations that are now at work for the attainment of a great national purpose. As if to aid and direct these efforts on the part of the community, an Asso- ciation has been formed, within a few years, consisting, for the most part, of men distinguished not only by the rank which they fill in society, but also by their talents, acquirement, and public spirit. This Association has been formed, not as other literary unions are, for the extension of information amongst their respective members, or for the cultivation of some particular department of

23 this has been attended with one ill consequence that deserves notice. When a man's mind has been constantly directed !o a particular pursuit, or department of study, and has been engaged for a considerable time in such investigations as it requires, it evin- ces a remarkable proneness to make a general application of the principles derived from its favorite study, and to reduce within their limits subjects with which they have no legitimate connexion. Thus a well known writer who had long made Geology his study, and who, from observing the mode of aggregation in different masses of matter, naturally enough concluded that a mass of rock, or even a mountain, is formed in the same way as a single crystal is, viz. by attraction of particles, extends the operation'of the principle a step further, and concludes thatManis also formed by attraction, and, there- fore, is little else than a crystal. He fancies, to use his own words, that he has arrived at the knowledge of the great truth to which all geolo- gical phenomena lead, namely, " that all the diversities of formation arise only through external movements, modifying the internal powers of attraction, and which, at last, when they have reached their highest pitch of conflict, against each other, give rise to the vivifying power." And further on he adds, "the great course of Nature is one and the same, from the coagulation of granite up to the career of man." A system of a very different character from this, but founded on equally questionable views, has been advocated by some zoologists of considerable reputation. In the first place, it is taken for granted that Matter when put in motion has a tendency to assume certain forms, and, if subjected to the influence of heat and moisture, will engender some of the more simple animalculae. In the next place, it is with equal complacency assumed, that these do not remain in their original condition, but possess a tendency to improve in their conformation, and by a successive series of gradations become more and more per- fect in their structure, and are evolved into new conditions of exis- tence, passing through all the phases of being, from the mite, or animated dot, up to man. So that, to use the words of these imagi- native persons, *' the origin of the cedar of Libanus may be deduced from a lichen, that of the elephant from a zoophyte, whilst

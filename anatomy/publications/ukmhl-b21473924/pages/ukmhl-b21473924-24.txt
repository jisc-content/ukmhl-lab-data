16 far beyond the narrow sphere in which we move and live: at a glance it darts through the immensity of space, and reveals to us the harmony and order which reign through every part of the system. It has been often and truly said, " that as we take no note of time hut from its loss," so we seldom set a true value on our powers and possessions until we have felt their privation; how limited would not our knowledge, and our capacity of enjoyment be, but for the organ of vision ! but for that of hearing, would we not be incapable of receiving communica- tions from those around us? would we not be reduced to the state of mutes, incapable of giving expression to our thoughts, and utterly unfitted for the social condition. You examine the Ear, you are told it is an acoustic apparatus; you study the Eye, it is called an optical instrument, yet you find it greatly more perfect than any instrument of human invention or contrivance: a knowledge of its structure is indispensably necessary to a right understanding of the many questions that arise out of inquiries into its functions; and, when you consider the delicacy and minuteness of its parts, and the diseases to which they are liable, and then reflect on the operations required for their cure, you will at once perceive how carefully you must study the structure of this organ, if you ever intend to practise ophthalmic surgery.

He thinks, he feels, he reasons too; and, accordingly, we find him endowed with a special organ, the Brain, which has been teimed "the material instrument of the mind/' This we recognize as the controller,â€”the director of the different parts of our complex system; to it they are subservient, by it they are guided in their various ministries. What subject can be better fitted to engage your at- tention than the structure and function of this organ ? But, confessedly, there is not one within the wide range of the Psychology of man, that is more beset with difficulty, or which involves more doubtful and

88 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. unevennesses were derived from brandies, which in these places were given off from the main tubes, but which were filled and rendered invisible by the varnish by which the preparation had been penetrated. Retzius only examined the cortical substance in a molar tooth of the rhinoceros. The thin shell of this which covered the crown, as also the thicker one round the roots, presented thinly-strewn, large cells of various, and, as it seemed to him, irregular forms. Some were round, 2M line p. M. broad ; others were drawn out longitudinally, partly in the shape of tubes, partly as irregular figures: a number of tubes opened into all of them from every side. Round the circular cells the tubes which opened into them lay very close, and presented a radiated aja- pearance. Sus Scrofa.â€”In the pig, of which Retzius examined a small molar and two canines, he found the greatest dia- meter of the tubes to be sfe p.m. They diminish only gradually towards the outer extremities, and do not become very minute until they reach the outer part of the tooth, where they are distributed into an irregular net-work of tubes and calcareous cells, and form the outer wall of the dental bone. They are but slightly curved, and are scarcely to be called undulating. Most inferiorly, to- wards the alveolar border, they are of the form of the letter C ; near the middle of the crown they are almost straight and parallel with the axis of the tooth ; and to- wards the masticating extremity, they present the form of an S. Their distance from each other is about the Avidth of from one and a half to two tubes. Their divisions in an external direction are furcated and acutely angulai. The branches thus formed run immediately after the divi- sion again parallel with each other. Moreover, along

PREFACE. X examination. Without recurring to such an explanation as this, it is impossible to conceive how such men as Hunter, Cuvier, Bichat, and Blandin, for instance, can often flatly contradict each other. Those who have hi- therto published the results of their experiments in this department of anatomy, have, for the most part, omitted to give an account of their methods of investigation, and of the species, age, &c. of the subjects which have been submitted to examination ; thus rendering it impossible to test the accuracy of their facts, and to discover the source of fallacy either in the new views, or in those which had hitherto been current. I have endeavoured to conduct my investigations on a scale which I conceived commensurate with the import- ance of the subject; and in detailing the results which I have arrived at, I shall give as careful a description as possible of the nature of the experiments, dissections, or observations which led me to them. The substance of what I have to offer will go to prove, I think, a greater degree of simplicity and uniformity, than has hitherto been suspected in the organisation of these structures. The great advance which has of late years been made in the science of optics, has enabled the student of minute anatomy to penetrate into new regions,â€”has unfolded, as it were, new provinces of animated existence to the gaze of the zealous and delighted inquirer. The urgent de- mands made by geologists, for microscopic sections of dif-

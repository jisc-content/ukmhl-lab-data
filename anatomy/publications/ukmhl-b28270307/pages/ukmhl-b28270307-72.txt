50 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tine varnish; and on examining them under the micro- scope, found that they were composed, not merely of hollow fibres, but of ramifying tubes, of which the trunks open into the cavity of the tooth, supporting themselves on its jiulp, whilst their terminations, in the form of ex- tremely fine branches, run towards the external surface of the tooth. The branches were most distinct, and most easily shown at the external extremities of the main tubes; but in the whole course of the canals, both dichotomous divisions and delicate branches were ob- served ; the latter were infinitely minute, and formed, as it were, a peculiar vascular system. Under reflected light, and on a dark ground, all these tubes seemed to contain a white matter. The enamel he found to con- sist of hexagonal solid prisms,* on which were generally observed transverse lines or streaks, making them ap- pear as if they were formed of several jiieces, lying one above the other : they rested with one end against the crown of the tooth, and with the other formed a part of its surface. Round the roots and necks of teeth he found a structure presenting some similarity to osseous substance, from the small cavities it contained, which, under reflected light, appeared to be filled with white matter, and from the number of winding, anastomosing tubes, as well as other larger canals opening into these cavities. This is the cortical substance which has been described as existing in the teeth of elephants, pigs, and oxen, by Tenon, G. Cuvier, and Fr. Cuvier, but which plainly forms part also of the teeth of man, and many other animals, in which it has not hitherto been re- marked.f In man the contiguous tubes appear to run parallel to â€¢ Pliitc A. 1.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 71 forming oblique, equilateral squares. Tlie red colour has its seat in this enamel, but in only a very thin layer of it. Just beyond the border of the gum the thickness of this layer was rai line p. m. ; nevertheless, in an extremely thin slice, and magnified several hundred times, it was strongly marked, and had a well-defined border towards the white part of the enamel. Bradypus Tridactylus.—In the Bradypus, the tubes are very different from those in the preceding animals. Tlie substance which properly corresponds to the solid dental bone consists here of merely a thin cylindric shell, which in newly-formed teeth is probably closed in the crown, but which was wanting there in all the teeth of these animals examined by Retzius. The cylindrical shell, which is consequently formed from the proper solid white dental substance, is filled towards the crown with a yel- lowish or brown, half-transparent, softer, almost horn- like substance, which terminates internally towards the end of the pulp.* In young subjects this plug, if it may so be called, is very short; in older ones, it is longer, and is continued through half or two-thirds of the whole tooth. In this internal, yellowish, horn-like substance, a sort of coarse tubes are generally seen of \ to to" p. m. in thick- ness, which proceed from the surface contiguous to thepul^i, rise towards the crown, and are curved outwards in such a manner that the middle ones are generally parallel to the axis of the tooth, whilst the external ones turn more towards the sides, just as in certain teeth of fishes, or * Of the shell here mentioned, F. Cuvier observes, “ Tonies Ics machelicres ont la mcme forme, soril cylindriqnes el leur purlic cenlrale se compose (Tune subslaricc pins Icmlre ([ue velle qui Tcnvironne, el rjni csl analogue ii Tcmail, (luoirjuc moins dur quo lui.”

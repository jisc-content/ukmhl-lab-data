12 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. milk-teeth; the other, which is a true canal, transmitting those of the permanent teeth. These writings of Jour- dain, which are devoted exclusively to the subject of the developement of the teeth, are of great interest; for it is evident that he made numerous experiments on the sub- ject, and only describes what he saw. John Hunter, in his work on the teeth, printed in London in the year 1778, describes with uncom- mon clearness and precision the results of the investi- gations which had hitherto been made on the sub-’ ject; and adds an account of a number of important ex- periments made by himself. He says that the enamel, which he calls lamina vitrea, is composed of striae run- ning from the circumference to the centre; he believes that it is quite inorganic, because it cannot be converted, by any means whatever, into animal mucus: exposed to fire, it separates from the ivory. Hd calls the latter the osseous part of the teeth, and holds that it is analogous to bone. He says, however, that madder only reddens those layers which are formed whilst the animal is fed with it, and does not at all change the colour of those which pre- viously existed,—a fact which shows that this substance differs a little from bone. A part of the tooth once im- pregnated with madder always retains the colour of the latter ; and Hunter concludes from his experiments, that the teeth are to be considered as anomalous bodies with respect to their circulation. He thinks that the roots are surrounded by a perios- teum which comes from the alveolus, and which is pro- longed into the cavity of the tooth; and that the ivory is formed of concentric laniinee. He states that the in- cisors have three centres of ossification ; the canine only one, and the molars three or four : that the tooth, at the

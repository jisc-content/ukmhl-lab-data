HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 150 Serres has already described, and which, he most erro- neously states, contribute afterwards to deposit the tartar of the teeth. That they are connected with the formation of the epithelium is proved by the scales; but in what manner has not yet been ascertained. Perhaps, also, they are the same follicles which Arnold describes in a new- • born infant as apertures, situated near the most promi- nent margin of the gum, and which, in his opinion, lead to the sacs of the incisors and the canine. (See Frankel, Dissert, de Dent. Human. Struct, p. 4.) “ In the first stages of developement, (as far as we are able to judge in certain animals (the calf, the sow, and the dog,) the stratum of epithelium is much thicker than afterwards. The conformation of its scales is not yet such as in the period which precedes birth; but they present a parenchyma very similar to the cellules of plants—every scale which afterwards appears as such presenting itself then as a polyedric cellule, consisting of very tenacious membrane, and containing a globular drop of fluid. These cellules were ruptured by pressure, and lymphatic fluid was poured out. In the course of developement they are probably flattened and changed into the polyedric scales. At first, the stratum of epithelium is most easily sepa- rated from the subjacent parenchyma of the mucous mem- brane. It presented, in a calf of nine weeks, above the molars, in the surface separated from the teeth, a double series of processes like epistomia, which, although lodged in the corresponding cavities of the parenchyma of the gum, still did not, as it at first seemed, penetrate into the cavities themselves of the molars, being evidently sepa- rated from these by the capsular membrane and enamel- pulp.”

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 99 In an old tooth of the dolphin, Retzius found cortical substance only in that part which is wedged into the alveolus, and there only in a rather thin layer. It dis- played here also a great abundance of similar, almost parallel tubes, running from without to the surface of the dental bone, between which the cells were situated. The latter were for the most part drawn out into irregular shapes : some were very large ; but most were oval and round. The round ones were of the size of ^ line p.m. ; the oval ones 5^ line broad, and double as long. They lay in beautiful rows, running towards the periphery of the tooth, and the tubes opened into them in almost equal quantities at every angle. Crocodilus Sclerops and Esox Lucius.â€”The teeth of the crocodile and of the pike have a covering of enamel on the crown, and a tolerably thick coat of cortical substance on that part which is situated within the alveolus. The breadth of the largest tubes of the dental bone is p.m. They are in lengthy curves, are considerably apart, and faintly undulating. In several places they present parallel curves; but still run without definite arched curves, and (when slightly magnified) seem to course almost straight from the internal cavity to the external surface of the tooth. Their distance from each other was equal to the breadth of four or five of them. The trunks of the tubes divide dis- tinctly immediately after their commencement at the in- ternal cavity : the branches of the divisions curve imme- diately away from each other, and wind particularly in the neighbourhood of the root nearly irregularly. Nume- rous minute branches of various lengths are given off on all sides, of which, however, most seem to turn towards the root. These ramusculi seem in many places to ter- minate with dilated extremities in osseous cells. Nnme- II 2

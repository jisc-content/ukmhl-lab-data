HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 48 tubuli, but also in the intermediate substance, which con- tains, at all events, the greater part of the calcareous earth, either chemically united with the cartilage, or de- posited in it in an invisible manner. The calcareous earth of the intermediate substance may he rendered visible, by carefully boiling for several hours fine sections of teeth in a solution of potash. The substance between the fibres, which was before transparent, then becomes, from the solution of a great part of its cartilage, opaque and white; and the sections are rendered extremely brittle, and cannot without great caution be further polished. The calcareous matter presents the appearance of thick- set granules. Near the cavity of some teeth which had been treated in this way, lines were observed running pa- rallel to the surface of the former. According to Purkinjeâ€™s researches the enamel consists of simple perpendicularly-placed fibres, increasing some- what in size towards their upjier extremity, forming qua- drilateral prisms, and often making several curves on one and the same level. These fibres are adherent to lamellae, which run transversely round the tooth, and generally rest obliquely on the surface of the dental substance. These observations are fully confirmed by Muller, who has examined the last molar tooth of a calf, on which the enamel was still soft, and found that even in this state the latter consists of separate prisms, as yet uncemented, but held together by a transparent fluid matter. These firm but somewhat flexible fibres are not easily acted on by acetic acid, but quickly dissolve in muriatic acid, without any perceptible escape of air. The interior of the roots of old teeth consists, according to Purkinje, not of dental substance, but of bone properly so called, as does also the dejiosit on the external surface

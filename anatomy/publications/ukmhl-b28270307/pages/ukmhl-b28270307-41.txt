HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 19 whether it is an organised substance, or merely a fluid exuding from the external surface of the tooth, and har- dening round it. His observations are more valuable where he comes to treat of the sympa^iies and functions of the teeth. After the eruption of the second teeth, he says that they evidently grow both longer and thicker ; but that they lengthen only at the root; that the crown has always the same dimensions, and that its appearing - longer in old than in young men is owing to the shrink- ing of the gums, which is also observed in persons who become emaciated, in those who have been under a course of mercury, &c. He adds, that the teeth only increase in substance internally, “ the canal of the root and the cavity of the body become gradually narrower, and at length become obliterated : then, as the vessels and nerves no longer penetrate into the tooth, it dies and drops out of its socket; but this death seems to be also accelerated by the accumulation throughout its substance of phosphate of lime, which so predominates over its gelatine, that its vitality is entirely extinguished, so that, in this respect, the loss of the teeth presents a phenomenon similar to that of the falling off of the horns of herbivorous ani- mals,” &c. The ivory he considers to be of a rocky consistence, very different from cellular tissue. Its fibres, he says, are very close, run in different directions, but chiefly towards the root, and are distinguished with dif- ficulty. He states that the internal cavity is lined with a thin membrane, “ qui par sa face opposee revet la pulpe.” The pulp he regards as a spongy substance, which ap- pears to be formed by the interlacement of vessels and nerves; but the nature of which is not well known: its sensibility, however, he describes as great, and as equal at least to that of the marrow.

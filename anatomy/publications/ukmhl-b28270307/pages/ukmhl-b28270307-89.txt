IIISTOIUCAL INTRODUCTION. 67 tlie tooth, and giving off in their course otlier curved branches above and below, which cross the contiguous tubes. Sorex Fodiens.—In the shrew, in which the teeth are still smaller, (the dental substance in the incisor teeth near the root being in some parts only to" p. m. thick from the cavitas pulpae to the surface,) the tubes are in the same proportion very short. Still their diameter at their commencement is equal to that in the human sub- ject ; and their outer extremities lose themselves in equally fine points or branches. They accordingly di- minish very rapidly, and in these places pi’esent no longer the appearance of cylindric tubes, but of small, sharply- pointed cones, which give off a number of proportionally thick branches, which again subdivide several times. In the apices, too, of the incisor teeth, which are so pecu- liarly formed in this animal, the ramifications of the main tubes are particularly well seen—some of the branches being small, short, and their direction transverse ; others being extended, longer, and longitudinal in their course. Castor Fiber and Lepus Borealis.—In the heaver, as well as in the hare, the main tubes are of the same diameter as in the preceding, and present the most remarkable and extensive ramification in the whole length of the tooth. In the incisor, as well as in the molar teeth, most of the tubes present a curve like the letter f. In the incisor teeth most of the branches are given off from that side of the main tube which is turned towards the crown : in the molar teeth, on the other hand, the most numerous and the largest bundles of branches appear to have their origin on the side towards the root, and along the root of the tube. The main tubes lie very close together, par- ticularly in the crown, so that tlie intermediate spaces F 2

41 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Mr. Hunter’s experiment with madder proves, he thinks, the concentric deposition of the dental substance ; but, strange to say, he ascribes that experiment to Cuvier, whose work was not published less than forty years after Mr. Hunter had described it. With respect to the fibrous structure of the teeth, he compares its appearance to the rays of a quill. He notices and explains the “ osteides” Avhich are found occasionally in the internal cavity of the teeth, and which Bertin had noticed before him. According to Rousseau the second set of teeth are more solid than the first, being required for harder ali- ment. He asserts that the first set of teeth exert so strong a pressure on the alveolus, that they deprive the milk-teeth of nourishment and vitality by compressing the nerves and vessels which are distributed to them. In his opinion the order of succession is quite different from that which Serres gives with regard to the canine. The work under consideration gives a very accurate description of dentition in many of the lower animals. The porous appearance of the teeth of the orycteropus is remarked, which has so erroneously been considered as a striking example of the tubular structure of the teeth. Rousseau maintains that what has obtained the name of cortical or cement, is nothing but a dental tartar, and he attempts to explain the manner in which this is produced. The section which he devotes to the “ aberrations and maladies of the dental system,” is very instructive. He traces the origin of the erosion of the teeth to a congenital source, and explains the mode in which he conceives that it is effected. “ There are examples,” he says, “ where the foetus has been attacked by partial or general inflam- mations, without any morbid affection on the part of the mother .... This truth has been confirmed by the exa-

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 60 tinned round their crowns, though internally they are less distinct and less regular. Leeuwenhoek was acquainted with these lines, and believed that they marked the stages of the progress of the teeth through the gums. From examining a fossil horse-tooth, in which they were very large and plain, Retzius comes to the conclusion that they are formed from the enamel-fibres having united into belts, of which the inner rests on the tooth-bone, whilst the outer projects beyond that next to it. The enamel is first deposited on the extremity of the crown, or on the apices of the masticating surface; round this first deposit the next succeeding one forms a conical belt, which is again in its turn surrounded by another, and so on till the ena- mel is completed. In milk-teeth Retzius could not suc- ceed in ascertaining that any of these rings existed. In the interior of longitudinal fractures, or of polished longitudinal sections of enamel, two other appearances are observable. One consists of a sort of generally broAvnish parallel lines, which in teeth with their crowns not yet worn down, curve round the coronal apices of the dental bone ; but which towards the sides, particularly in teeth with wedge-formed crowns, run nearly parallel with the axis of the tooth. Some of the coarser of these lines are perceptible to the naked eye. They appear to be the traces of different stages in the formation of enamel, and are analogous to the lines running round the cavity of the pulp in the dental bone. Schreger found that horizontal transverse sections of enamel presented three different belts or layersâ€”an external gray one, a milk-white middle one, and a third gray like the first, in contact with the dental bone. These layers, says Retzius, are obviously the coarse lines mentioned above, or several fine ones in con- junction.

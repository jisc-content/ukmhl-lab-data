HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 110 is situated, after the latter has been removed. (See Heu- singer, Zeitschr. f. d. organ. Physik, Bd. l.Taf. vi. fig. 2.) The same author incorrectly asserts that the teeth of both the anarrhichas and the jiike are invested with enamel; whilst Andre on the other hand says, (Phil. Trans, of the Royal Society, vol. Ixxiv. p. 277,) “ The teeth are formed of a hard bony matter, not covered with enamel as in some animals.” Retzius has never found a trace of ena- mel on any protruded tooth of the anarrhichas, which had grown fast at its base. Having, however, always Muthout exception seen the teeth of this animal worn away at the apex, he examined the small dental germs enclosed in the above-mentioned reserve-alveoli, and found that all these had at their apex, or at the point which corresponded to it, a small portion of enamel. The germs of the conical, pointed, front teeth had only the extreme summit coated with enamel; the lenticular germs of the obtuse teeth in the vomer had in the centre of their almost flat and radiated coronal surface a small white ele- vation of enamel, of which the breadth at the base was not quite p. M. That a fish which uses its teeth for crushing large muscles, snails, lobsters, &c., must soon wear off these small tips of enamel, and that the latter indeed can scarcely be of any use here, seems to be quite evident. The main tubes in the dental bone are somewhat larger than in the ling; the inner ones run parallel with the axis of the tooth ; the external ones incline somewhat out- wards. This direction of the main tubes in the anarrhi- chas has its origin in the circumstance that the formation of the tooth is in a great measure finished before the ca- vity of the pulp has begun to be formed, as may be learnt from the dental germs; hence the cavity of the pulp does not attain, as in the ling, the extended form of a main tube, from the sides of which the other tubes rise. 1 hese main

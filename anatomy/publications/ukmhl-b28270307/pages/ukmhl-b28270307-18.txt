PREFACE. Xll torily to explain this, and knowing that it had already been recorded by Cuvier, I did not attach sufficient im- portance to it, as it did not then seem to me to be likely to lead to any practical results. My observations were shortly afterwards interrupted, owing to the imperfections of the microscope which I then used, and to the difficulty I experienced in making suitable sections of the teeth. I did not at first intend to publish the whole of Ret- ziusâ€™s account of the tubular system in different animals, but I at length determined to do so, as I found that it could not be divided without injury to the whole, and that, moreover, I should frequently be compelled to refer to almost every part of it. Those who contemplate the teeth merely as ornaments, or consider them in no other light than as the active agents at a feeding trough, or as the formidable weapons of the wild tenants of the forest, will, doubtless, regard the details of Retzius as irksome and tedious; but he who with ardour and admiration tracks the steps of Na- ture through the regions of Zoology, will welcome with delight a full description of these new researches; he will recognise at once their importance, and cannot fail to be struck with the unostentatious manner in which a great mind has opened to the world a new field of exertion, foreseeing its value to the student of Geology as well as of Natural History. But I have been still further in- duced to publish the researches of Retzius, from having

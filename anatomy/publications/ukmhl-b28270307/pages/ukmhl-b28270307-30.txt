8 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Malpighi says that the teeth consist of two parts, of which the interioi:, a bony lamella, is formed of fibrous and, as it were, tendinous hair, woven into a kind of net-work. Dentes “ duplici excitantur parte, quarum interior ossea la- mellafibrosis et quasi tendinosis capillamentis,innaturam retis implicitis, constat.” Anatome plantarum, Lugd. Batav., 1687, p. 37.

At page 71, 1. c. he says of the incisor tooth, — “ sensim in cylindrum seu jistu- lani desinit, quce intra mandibulam condita loco radicis in- servit.”—“ Totus tubulosus est, et folliculum continet.” The most valuable publication, however, of the seven- teenth century on the subject of the teeth, is a jiaper of Leeuwenhoek, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1678, in which we find the following remarkable passage : —“ I have some time since applied a glass (esteemed by several gentlemen who had tried it a very good one) to observe the structure of the teeth and other bones, which both to them and myself also then seemed to consist of globules; but since then, having drawn out one of my teeth, and for further observation applied better glasses than the former, the same gentlemen with myself agreed, from what we plainly saw, that the whole tooth was

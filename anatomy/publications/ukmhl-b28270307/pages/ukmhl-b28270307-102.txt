80 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. In the incisor teeth of the horse, too, are found several somewhat opaque streaks, running- parallel to the cavitas pnlpee, which resemble the annual circles in a tree. These did not result, however, here alone from certain parallel curvatures of the main tubes, hut principally from similar calcareous cellules, which presented themselves in the same track in the greatest part of the length of the tooth. (See Plate A. 3. Fig. 6.) Round these cellules wound also numerous ramusculi, and seemed to terminate in them. In the dental sub- stance, which fills the cavity of the pulp from above, similar cells are found, but much larger. In a milk incisor-tooth the tubes were much more con- spicuous than in the permanentâ€˜ones. The trunks here evidently divided in many places in a furcated manner: The small branches were given off from the trunks at very short intervals from each other. Where they gave off branches the trunks were in many places dilated, as it were, and thus presented an unequal appearance. The branches ran partly stretched out, and inclining at an acute angle towards the external ends of the main tubes, and in part transversely towards these in short arches. Osseous cells were everywhere scattered throughout the intermediate spaces; but here, too, they were most numerous in the surface of the tooth, and under the enamel. The main tubes were most undulating near the cavity of the pulp ; as they advanced towards the surface the un- dulating curvatures gradually diminished. On the posterior side of the neck of the tooth were found, along the axis of the tooth, longitudinal streaks, which arose from parallel curvatures and furcated divi- sions of the tubes. The streaks did not here owe their

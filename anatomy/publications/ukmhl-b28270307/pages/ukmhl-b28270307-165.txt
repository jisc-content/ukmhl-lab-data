HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 143 of the roots, is produced by the dental pulp like the other dental substance, or whether it has not its origin at a later period in the transformation of the capsular and enamel- membranes into true osseous membrane, and belongs thus to true bone. This perhaps takes place also in the ce- ment of horses and of ruminantia, where the whole is similar to true osseous substance—but on this point we have had no experience to instruct us. “ We proceed now to explain the formation of the sub- stance of the enamel. This is not, as previous writers have erroneously maintained, a deposition (like that ob- served in the formation of minerals, or as if it were a crystalline sediment) from the lymph surrounding the den- tal germ, but its formation also is effected by a true organic process. We have already accurately determined the ori- gin, structure, and form of the organ by which the enamel- substance is formed. It still remains to explain more closely the nature of its function, as it appears to us. The organ from which the substance of the enamel is immedi- ately formed is the enamel-membrane which we have de- scribed above. Each of its short perpendicular fibres is to be regarded as an excretory organ or gland, destined for the secretion of the enamel-fibre corresponding to it. At the same time with the first formation of the dental sub- stance and pari gressu from the coronal apex to the root, each one also of these fibrillse, whilst it places itself on the now hardened praeformative membrane, begins to deposit in due order the primitive part of each enamel-fibre, so that each one of these enamel-fibres, carefully examined under a microscope, shows tliat it is composed of layers disposed in a transverse direction. At the period when these fibres are being formed, an organic lymph seems to be secreted from the parenchyma of the enamel-mem-

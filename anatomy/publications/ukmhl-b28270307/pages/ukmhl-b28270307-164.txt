142 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. fibres, which increase in breadth as they proceed from without inwards, and which in mutual apposition form continuous canals, rise at the periphery of the dental substance, proceed with many delicate windings to the pulp of the tooth, and its cavity, where their mouths ojien, and serve there, as long as the formation of the dental substance lasts, towards gathering new fibres, until at length these apertures also, in the last stage of the de- velopement of the tooth, are closed by a somewhat dif- ferent substance, which is yellow and semi-transparent, and which has been compared by Blumenbach to cor- neous tissue. â€œ Whilst the growth of the dental substance is thus advancing, the dental germ increases in the same manner at the radical extremity. Although at first it only formed the extreme apex of the crown, by degrees its growth ex- tends into the body of the tooth, and as the developement proceeds it is narrowed into one or more dental roots, which, after the dental substance has made still further progress, stretch into the dental cavity, like broad canals filled with a considerable quantity of dental pulp. These canals, however, when the formation of the dental sub- stance is further advanced, become narrower by degrees, and when it is completed, give entrance to nerves and vessels only by one or more very small foraminula. We say by more than one aperture advisedly; for in the in- cisors of the stag, and in some rare cases of the human subject, we saw several canals, which in a transverse di- rection penetrated into the substance of the root of the tooth, so that in this i*espect it presented considerable si- milarity to true osseous substance. We were not able to decide whether that layer of osseous substance which, commencing at the neck of the tooth, invests the surface

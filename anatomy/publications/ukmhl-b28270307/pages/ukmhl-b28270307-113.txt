91 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Tlieir ramification, however, was much more distinctly evident. Both the long, bifurcated divisions of the tubes and the small lateral branches ran in acute angles towards the periphery of the tooth: a few only of the small lateral branches proceeded in short curves across the interstices and the most contiguous tubes. In the singular teeth of this animal, the dental bone is particularly remarkable from the numerous, large, cal- careous cells which, except at the extreme end of the alveolar part, lie scattered everywhere between the tubes. These calcareous cells appeared, nearer to the apex of the tooth, to be larger and oblong, and their length to be about 55 p. M. Besides these, there was situated in the entire circumference of the teeth, between the extremities of the tubes in the dental bone, a thick, delicate, compact layer also of calcareous cells. The incisors of this animal are also remarkable from the more recent irregularly- formed, and almost preponderating dental substance, which constitutes a great part of the internal mass of the tooth, and, so to say, fills its cavity from the apex to the alveolar end, with the exception of a short space where it is hollow for the reception of the short pulp. To the naked eye, this substance seems clearer, and presents in its transverse sections a number of ringsâ€”of eyelets, as it were, as also various darker patches. This is the ap- ])carance which G. Cuvier has compared with that of I)udding-stone, {Lemons cVAnatomic Comparce). This sub- stance with which the interior is, so to say, stuffed, plays a very important part both in the canine and molar teeth, and is the cause why only the outer shell of the canine teeth of the walrus is applicalile for finer bone-work. If an entire transverse section of a canine tooth of a walrus be examined, this spurious dental bone will lie found to

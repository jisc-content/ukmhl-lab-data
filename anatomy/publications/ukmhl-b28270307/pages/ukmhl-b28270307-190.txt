EXPLANATION OF PLATES, 2 seen the greater parallel curvatures, as well as the posi- tion of the main tubes, c. The apex of the tooth where the tubes are almost perpendicular. d d. The enamel. e e. The cavity of the pulp, in which are seen, by means of a magnifying glass, the openings of the tubes of the dental bone.” Plate A. 1, Fig. 3.—“ A vertical section of an im- perfectly developed human incisor, taken from the fol- licle in which it was still enclosed. This section is meant to show the position of the enamel-fibres, and also to demonstrate that a part of the appearances which are seen in this substance under a less magnifying power originate in parallel curvatures of the fibres, a a a. The enamel, h h. The tooth-bone or ivory.f d d. The mi- nute indentations and points on the surface of the ivory on which the enamel-fibres rest, e e. Brown parallel stripes; e* parallel flexions of the fibres of the dental bone in these stripes.” Plate A. 1, Fig. 4.—“ A portion of the surface of the enamel, on which the hexagonal terminations of the fibres are shown. a a a. Two more strongly marked dark crooked crevices running between the rows of the hexagonal fibres.” Plate A. 1, Fig. 5.—“ A small portion of fig. 2, covered with turpentine varnish, viewed under a magnifying power of three hundred and fifty times. It is seen that the tubes aaaaaa contain a powdery lumpy substance. They are regular and closely undulating; the branches do not appear, because they are penetrated by the varnish. Plate A. l,Fig.6.—“ A transverse section of the crown of fig. 2, in which the upper end of the cavity of the pulp * In the plate one h is erroneously placed on the enamel.

SERIES A. 3 lias been cut off; vieTved under a low magnifying power; the main tubes which are nearest the cavity being trans- versely cut, and the more external ones cut in an oblique direction.” Plate A. 1, Pig. 7.—“ A small j^ortion of the same sec- tion viewed under a magnifying power of three hundred and fifty times. On the right side are seen the round openings of the tubes e e e,ff, with parietes of a peculiar substance. The tubes on the left hand side h h, ii, a a, are obliquely cut in consequence of their more external posi- tion.” Plate A. 1. Fig. 8.—“The position of the same main tubes in a transverse section magnified five times, near the root of a bicuspis. The dark patches in this figure mark the places in which the bone Avas especially white and less transparentthan in the clearer intermediate tracts’” Plate A. 1, Fig. 9.—“ A transverse section taken from near the root of a canine tooth of an elderly person, which had a covering of cortical substance unusually thick, a. The cavitas pulpae. b. The tooth-bone. c. The cortical substance.” Plate A. 1, Fig. 10.—“ A molar tooth of an old cow, covered entirely with cortical substance, which has been partly removed; this cortical covering increases in thick- ness towards the root. a. The enamel, b b. The cortical substance.” Plate A. 2, and Plate A. 3, “ represent the tubes of the dental bone considerably magnified, with the various ways in which they ramify in different animals.” (These two plates are executed on a dark ground in Retzius’ work, but as there seemed to be no advantage derived from that arrangement, they have been done in the usual manner.)

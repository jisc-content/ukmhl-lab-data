148 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. enamel-pulp is transformed into the organ which secretes the cement, viz. that in the deep fossse and lateral recesses of the teeth of ruminantia, of horses, and of rodentia, after the formation of the enamel-substance has been com- pleted, the simple enamel-puljD remains without any con- tact with the alveolar parietes, and it is here, therefore, the only organ there can be for the production of the enamel. Finally, the enamel pulp on the external sur- face of the tooth, where it comes into contact with the alveolar parietes, may, together with the capsule, he com- bined with the periosteum,—and this supposition is fa- voured by the circumstance, that the granular and tubular structure of the cement presents the greatest similarity to that of true bone. “ This observation, too, ought not to be omitted, that that membrane which clothes the alveolus, and corresponds to the periosteum, displays even at the first glance, but prin- cipally where it is joined to the external jiarts, a loose texture, similar to the pulmonary tissue, and which, when examined under a glass, displays, besides a large quantity of sanguiferous vessels, a number of air-canals of consi- derable diameter, to the presence of which the soft and elastic nature of this tissue is owing : their object, ]3erhaj)s, is to afford greater mobility to the advancing tooth. We have mentioned this subject in order that the attention of the reader may be directed to the air-vessels which are met with in the animal body, and to correct rather than confirm the belief respecting them. It ought, moreover, to be mentioned, that on the interior surface of the lobes of the gum which surround the protruding molars of the young ruminantia, similar rows of perpendicular fibres are found to those which we described in the enamel- membrane. It is a question how fiir they have tlie same

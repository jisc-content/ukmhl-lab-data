HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 160 1836, tells US, that they are composed of plates, situated parallel to their external surface; and this statement was made a year after Purkinje, and others, in Germany, had so beautifully demonstrated their fibrous texture. This latter subject has been further elucidated in the most complete manner by Professor Retzius; and that the structure of the ivory is at any rate fibrous, could not now be denied even by M. Serres, or by those who have stood up for its rocky or simply stratified character. The labours of Retzius and his contemporaries must be considered as a most splendid contribution to minute anatomy; but I still think that the evidence in favour of the existence of a system of ramifying tubes in dental bone or ivory, requires much further examination and corrobo- ration, before we can be justified in adopting a theory tending to overthrow many received opinions, results of ordinary experience. The difficulty in arriving at just views of this subject is partly owing, I think, to the cir- cumstance that writers have comprehended very different structures under the same term. All the diversified textures entering into the composition of the bodies of difierent teeth have been described as dental bone or ivory ; and it is unfortunate that the advocates of a tubular system have not been much more precise than their predecessors in defining the specific nature of the various dental structures, in which they state that they have traced hollow fibres. Like all newly-propounded doctrines, the theory of a tubular system, as laid down in the preceding pages, will be found to present some internal contradictions. “ It can scarcely be doubted," says Retzius, “ that the tubes in dental bone, in the coi tical substance, in common bone, and in the horns of deer, as well as the cells with which they are in connexion, are a peculiar kind of

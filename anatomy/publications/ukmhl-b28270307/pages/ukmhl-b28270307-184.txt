162 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. to the decided conviction that neither tabescence, absorption, nor erosion has anything to do with it.” This is a state- ment which may be so easily refuted by the simplest ob- servation, that I need not here waste the time of the reader by entering into a formal demonstration of its fallacy. With a candour which cannot be too highly praised, Retzius allows that he is ignorant of the specific func- tions of the tubes in the dental bone of the adult tooth. His ideas on this subject, as might be expected at this early stage of the inquiry, are far from definite. “ In common hone,probably ” says he, “ the peculiar vessels in question take a part in the continual, or apparently continual, exchange of substance: this cannot in the same degree be the case in dental bone, inasmuch as in this no such exchange appears to take place. What end then is served by this beautiful organisation of dental bone ? We have many examples that nature or- ganises structures which have a close affinity to each other according to one and the same plan, and hence we have, in different parts or organisms, formations, which in some are of the greatest importance, whilst in others they are of much less functional significance, or of none whatever. If we hence assume, what is highly probable, that in bone the peculiar vessels in question give passage to fluids during the entire life of the animal, (or a great part of it,) which fluids contain the solid as well as the liquid ma- terials of the osseous substance; it does not necessarily follow that the same process must be carried on in the teeth during the whole of life. On the contrary, I am inclined to believe that these vessels in dental bone are at their height during the first period of the formation of the tooth, and exercise then their more perfect action.

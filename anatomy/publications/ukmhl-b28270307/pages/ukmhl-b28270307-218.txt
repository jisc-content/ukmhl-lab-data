Ninth Edition, with Additons, By Dr. Marshall Hall, F.R.S., and Dr. Samuel Merriman, F.L.S, One volume, 8vo. price 15s. Extract from the Editor’s Preface. “ Tlie first edition of tliis Treatise on the Diseases of Children was published about forty years ago by Dr. Underwood, whose reputation as an Accoucheur, and as Consulting Physician in all the complaints of Childhood, was very great. That this work, the result of much observa- tion and experience, has proved a valuable assistant to the medical profession, may be inferred, not only from the favourable manner in which it was received by his contemporaries, and the frequent quotations from, and references to it, with which the pajes of subsequent writers abound, but from the convincing fact, that it has passed through eight large editions in England, and has been repeatedly translated and reprinted on the Continent, and in America.” By DEliABERE F.

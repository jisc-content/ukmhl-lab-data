HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 126 these three stages are distinct; hut when vieAved in re- ference to both sets, and to the whole process of denti- tion, they become somewhat intermingled. “ When considered in the latter point of view, we may state that the follicular stage commences at the sixth or seventh week, and terminates at the fourth or fifth month of intra-uterine existence; that the saccular commences at the termination of the first, and lasts for certain of the teeth till the sixth or eighth month, and for others till the twentieth or twenty-fifth year of extra-uterine existence; and that the third, or eruptive, commences at the sixth or eighth month, and lasts till the twentieth or twenty-fifth year.” (p. 31.) “ Careful observation of the whole process of dentition in man, leads,” says Mr. Goodsir, “ to the following con- clusions :— Milk-teeth.—1. The milk-teeth are formed on both sides of either jaw, in three divisions, a molar, a canine and an incisive, in each of which dentition proceeds in an independent manner. 2. The dentition of the whole arch proceeds from be- hind forwards—the molar division commencing before the canine, and the latter before the incisive, 3. The dentition of each of the divisions proceeds in a contrary direction, the anterior molar appearing before the posterior, the central incisive before the lateral. 4. Two of the subordinate phenomena of dentition also obey this inverse law, the follicles closing by com- mencing at the median line, and proceeding backwards, and the dental groove disappearing in the same direc- tion. 5. Dentition commences in the upper jaw, and con- tinues in advance during the most important period . of its progress.

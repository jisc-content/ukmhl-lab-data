164 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tartar of the human teeth.’' (Muller’s Phys., translated by Di. Baly.) A simple examination of the organised structure of the cement by means of the microscope is suf- ficient to convince any one of the fallacy of this statement. See Plate C. 4. Retzius states that only three substances enter into the composition of the teeth in their various forms, viz. ivory, enamel, and cement; but I think that a fourth ought to to be added to this list, viz. a structure having the ap- pearance of ossified pulp, in which the vessels seem to retain their original position, but are found in a state of atrophy, intermingled occasionally with irregularly-formed ivory. This substance may be considered as constant as any of the other three : it constitutes almost exclu- sively the simjalest teeth, as those of the ornithorynchus,* anarrhichas lu^jus,'!' ; and it is occasionally found to enter into the composition of the teeth of almost every animal, either normally, as in the walrus,^ bradypus, orycteropus, § ptychodus polygyrus, j] &c., or abnor- mally, as in some human teeth. It also often jiresents itself in the diseased tusks of the elephant, a drawing of which is given in Plate C. 3, Fig. 2. c, where it is con- trasted with its normal appearance in the walrus. A detailed account of my own opinions and researches on the structure of the teeth the reader will find in the body of the work. The above remarks I offer more to justify myself for not fully and at once agreeing with all the positions laid down by those who have written on the dental tubes, than with the intention of directly refuting • Sec Plate C. 1.

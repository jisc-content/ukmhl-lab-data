21 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. mucous membrane by a canular prolongation, which esta- blishes a positive continuity on the one hand between the cavity of the mouth generally and that of the follicle, and on the other hand between the mucous membrane of the gum and the dental membrane. This canal, closed at an early stage by the approximation of its walls, but dilated at a later period by the tooth which traverses it for the purpose of arriving at the surface, represents in reality the neck of this particular follicle, but in a very elongated state.” Blandin states that “ the dental follicle is coinjiosed of two divisions, viz. of the membrane which constitutes its parietes, and of the pulp or papilla on which the tooth is formed. The membrane of the follicle consists,” he adds, “ of two layers—of an external and fibrous one, intended to adhere at a subsequent period to the alveolus as thealveolo- dental periosteum, and which is le derme of the mucous membrane of the mouth depressed in the form of a follicle to a level with the teeth—the other layer is situated inter- nally, is villous and vascular in its texture, and forms the cavity of the follicle. These two layers united are fur- ther described as extending to the base of the pulp, near the point at which it receives the vessels and nerves which form its pedicle ; but neither the one nor the other is really reflected on the pulp, as Bichat supposed. This eminent physiologist was deceived on this point,” says Blandin, “by the circumstance that the texture of the pulp is continuous with that of the internal layer of the follicle, from the bottom of which it is a vascular and nervous ex- pansion—a papilla analogous to those found in all parts of the tegumentary membrane, (but more extensively de- veloped on account of its peculiar functions,) and particu- larly to those of hair and feathers.”

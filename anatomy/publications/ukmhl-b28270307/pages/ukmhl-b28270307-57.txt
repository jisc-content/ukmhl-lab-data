historical introduction. 35 the action of fire. He concludes hy a series of observa- tions (p. 45) on the difference which he considers to exist between bones and teeth, and these, in order better to illustrate the subject, we will place in parallel co- lumns :— A BONE Passes through a cartilaginous stage. Has a periosteum. Is affected by rachitis and the other diseases of the osseous system. Is destroyed by concentrated nitric acid. When calcined, leaves a white re- sidue. Is destroyed in extra-uterine concep- tion. Is vascular. A TOOTH Passes through no cartilaginous stage, but is a transudation from the sur- face of the pulp. Has no periosteum. Is not affected by rachitis, or the other diseases of the bones. Is not affected by concentrated nitric acid. When calcined, leaves a bluish re- sidue. Remains untouched in extra-uterine conception. Is not vascular. Finally, bones decay much more quickly after interment than teeth ; and the diseases of bones and teeth ofier the least possible analogy. Serres relates many curious facts touching the indestructibility of the latter. The pulp he considers as especially formed by the nerve ; and in fact, he regards it as a “ veritable ganglion,” (p. 53.); and this opinion he follows up by speculations on its formative functions, and on the fluid which he says surrounds it. He is opposed to instituting any analogy between the pulp and the cartilage of bone ; he regards the tooth as an evident secretion from the pulp ; and, with respect to the structure of the former, makes an unfortunate asser- tion which has been signally refuted by the researches of more recent inquirers in this branch of science.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 127 Tlie first tooth-germ which appears is that of the supe- rior anterior molar, which precedes that of the inferior anterior molar. The apjiarent exception to this law in the case of the inferior incisive has already been explained. Permanent Teeth.—6. The germs of the permanent teeth, with the exception of that of the anterior molar, appear in a direction from the median line hack- wards. 7. The milk-teeth originate, or are developed, from the mucous membrane. 8. The permanent teeth, also originating from mucous membrane, are of independent origin, and have no con- nexion with the milk-teeth. 9. A tooth pulp and its sac must be referred to the same class of organs as the combined papilla and follicle, from which a hair or feather is developed, viz. bulbs.” (p. 35.) Mr. Goodsir, it is true, was anticipated in some of his observations by Arnold, in the Salzburg Med. Chir. Zeitung, 1831, p. 236 ; but he has treated his subject so much more fully than the latter gentleman, that I have thought proper to commence this portion of the subject with an account of his researches. Mr. Goodsir himself quotes the substance of Arnold’s statement, which is as follows :—“ In an embryo of the ninth week we may perceive in both jaws, on the projecting edges of the gums, a proportionally pretty deep furrow, with ten de- pressions in it; a little later we may see a flat surface, on which there are many openings, communicating with small sacs, into which fine bristles may be passed. At the third month, the sacs of the second molars may be seen com- municating with the cavity of the mouth by small holes.

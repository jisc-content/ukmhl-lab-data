54 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. without exception at the outer extremities of the main tubes: those which are given off more internally are fewer in number, and often appear as nothing more than rough- nesses or points on the tubes in the crown and neck of the tooth. On the other hand, they are very easily seen in the most recent, and as it appears more imperfect forma- tions of the tooth, as, for instance, in the wall of the crown, which looks down towards the bottom of the alveo- lus, which in the side teeth of the lower jaw is beneath, and in the side teeth of the ujDper jaw above, the coronal portion of the cavitas pulpse {superficies alveolaris of Fr'an- kel;) as also in the roots of the side teeth with more than one apex ; and, best of all, in that part of the root which, within the cavity of the pulp, lies towards the longitudinal axis of the tooth. Retzius could not discover that the branches from different tubes communicated with each other, except, perhaps, at their extremities. Most of the preparations which Retzius examined had been moistened with water, or soaked in olive-oil, or tur- pentine varnish : without which, he considered, they would not have been sufficiently clear. He found, however, that if completely penetrated by fluid, they became too transparent; the tubes and their branches filled uji, disap- peared, and left merely indistinct, delicate, faint streaks behind. The most delicate branches are first penetrated, and so are the first to vanish, leaving only here and there a curved line. On the other hand, when a prejiaration, either of a recent or dried tooth, newly-made and fresh dipped into one of the above fluids, is examined, the branches are seen in all their delicacy and abundance. But in proportion as the water, oil, or varnish penetrates tliem, they fill and disappear. From the same cause the main tubes in some parts of difierejit preparations of teeth,

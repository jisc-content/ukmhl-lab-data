Extracts from Author’s Preface. “ Many articles in this work treat of subjects not strictly belonging to Materia Medica— such as Bleeding, Diet, Firing, &c.; but as the volume is not intended as a guide to the vete- rinary practitioner alone, but to every horse-proprietor in the kingdom; and as I consider that many diseases may be removed, and still more prevented by a simple attention to diet, grooming, &c. I have deemed them not irrelevant to a work in which the practice of medicine is not attended to, to the entire exclusion of every other subject The present edition has been very considerably enlarged by the addition of several new medicines, which have either been found to possess some power over the diseases of horses, or which, not having received a fair trial, on account of other drugs, which exert a similar influence, being habitually employed, may, nevertheless, on some occasions, be administered with advantage. An Index has been added, for the benefit of those who are unacquainted with the names of those drugs whose properties resemble each other.” III. A TREATISE ON VETERINARY MEDICINE, VoL.

10 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. loso, qui versus dentis apicem inclinari videntur'^ “ Hce (strice) intersecantur aliis quasi crassis lineis, hrevihus pilis contextis, qua eleganti ordine horizontaliter ductce de- scribi nequeunt.” Duverney is the author of a monograph on the teeth, which contains much more vague speculation, and much less solid research, than the writings on this subject by Leeuwenhoek and Malpighi, This author compares the membrane which surrounds the tooth to that which en- velopes the foetus, and calls it the “ choroid.” He says that the follicle has the form of the tooth which it is destined to produce; and thinks that the latter is composed of layers of which the most external are the hardest. According to him, the choroid abandons the tooth at the period of extrusion, and remains in the alveolus, of which it forms the periosteum. Winslow (in his Exposition Anatomique, Paris, 1732, p, 46) says of the enamel, “ This vitreous matter, or spe- cies of enamel, when viewed through the microscope, appears to be composed of a number of very short fibres, so arranged that at one extremity they point inwards, and at the other outwards.” Ludwig, in his dissertation “ De Cortice Eentium” treats particularly of the struc- ture of the enamel, which he declares to be fibrous; he sets about indicating the direction of the fibres in the dif- ferent parts of the crown, and says that they all leave an imjiress on the ivory. Bertin, in his Treatise on Osteology, gives a complete description of the teeth, and states “ that it has appeared to him that the layer of enamel which invests the crown

76 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. mencement in the cavitas jmlpce, and the concavity of their curvatures vras in this part generally turned towards the crown. More internally, several branches ran in a ver- tical direction towards the main tubes. In the dental substance of the molar teeth the tubes present no large curvatures ; but at the outer wall one Avas observable, of which the convexity was turned towards the croAvn and the axis of the tooth. In the tubes lying- next to the crown this curvature was nearer to the exter- nal enamel; in those more in the neighbourhood of the root, it was nearer the middle of the tube. The tubes belonging to the alveolar part of the tooth were, for the most jiart, of the form of an f. All these tubes gave off branches in their entire course; but those were the most conspicuous and most numerous which formed the termination of the main tubes towards the enamel. Most of the ramusculi jiroceeding from the outer extremi- ties of the main tubes, appeared to be given off by the concave sides of the latter, which are turned towards the root; and they were themselves curved toAvards the root. In the Sheep, Retzius found only a thin layer of cortical substance on that part of the teeth which is covered Avith enamel; it was more plentifully deposited round the ends of the roots which Avere nearly closed, and also in the indentations of the croAvn. The cells as Avell as the tubes Avere rudely and very irregularly formed. In the thin lamella which invested the enamel, the cells seemed more to resemble large, reticular, vascular glands than proper cavities : the tubes were large, and their course irregular. In the cortical substance round the roots, some cells Avere oblong, very angular, and draAvn out to a considerable length ; and, moreover, a number of rude canals tolerably parallel, but very Avide apart, Avere

132 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. own investigations by no means allow us to adopt the oj3inion of Arnold; for we have never been able to see, either in the human foetus, or in other animals, any such apertures. We have examined with this ob- ject the foetuses of calves and sheep ; but we never saw the mucous membrane of the mouth dip into the alveolar groove; and in the grooves themselves we never disco- covered the deeper recesses which Arnold describes. It was always, on the contrary, clear to us, that the dental follicle at its origin is altogether separate from the gum, and is not closely attached to it by any intermediate con- nexion. Serres and Burdach were also in error Avhen they said that the dental germ is a continuation of the nerve; for we have shown above, that at its commence- ment neither nerves nor vessels are to be seen in it.” (p. 20.) I have commenced with this portion of Raschkow’s thesis, from its immediate connexion with the subject of which we have just been treating. The new doctrines promulgated by Raschkow relate principally to the existence of what he calls the adaman- tine organ or pulp, situated between the follicle and germ, and destined for the production of enamel. He considers that this organ is very different from the internal layer of the capsule, and requires a separate and distinct con- sideration. He gives a very circumstantial account of his manner of jiroceeding in these investigations. “ The dental follicle,” he says, “ which contains the other formative parts of the tooth, is, as it were, its com- mon chorion. It is surrounded by a dense network of vessels, which, distributed over it from the neighbouring blood-vessels, take their origin princijially in that part where the root of the tooth is situated. In the same

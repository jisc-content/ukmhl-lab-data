HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 55 particularly of their roots, are found to have disappeared entirely in some jilaces, and to have broken off, as it were, and have run into the faint lines above mentioned in others. Hence also teeth which have been long immersed in spirits of wine become quite transparent and similar to horn, like dried teeth which have been long kept in oil. When the wall of the cavitas pulpee is viewed under a glass of a sufficiently magnifying power, it is found to be perforated like a sieve, and to present an immense num- ber of orifices, which are the mouths of the main tubes. When a section of tooth-bone is made transversely to the latter, which is most easily effected in the crown where the tubes run parallel to the axis of the tooth, their inte- rior is rendered visible. They appear like rings, and are dark or light, or partially light, according as the light falls into them. Under a certain light they are bordered by a definite shadow, and when the light falls directly into them, present an appearance different from that of the substance of the tooth which surrounds them. Frequently these rings are of a darkish colour verging towards yel- low. From these appearances Retzius confidently con- cludes, that the tubes are not merely hollowed out of the substance of the tooth, but that they are true canals having their own walls; that the latter are of a structure differing in appearance from that of the tooth; and that the round spot inside the ring is the opening of the canal. When the transversely-cut preparations are viewed on a dark ground, the round circular spot is seen to be white; and white spots only are visible where before there were gene- rally transparent tubular orifices. Retzius was not able to see the rings or the walls of the tubes when he viewed the preparations on a dark ground. With respect to the contents of the canals, he found

Subsequently, however, the latter, probably by some chemico-organic process, enters into an intimate combination with earthy substances, and so forms the animal base of the enamel-substance, which (after they have been dissolved by acids) again presents itself under the form of a mucous tissue ; this, how- ever, on account of its extreme delicacy, cannot be easily discerned by the naked eye, nor without the aid of a mag- nifying glass. â€œ In order to explain the various curvatures of the enamel-fibres, we must suppose that the enamel-mem- brane also, during the progress of formation of the enamel-substance, changes the situation of its fibres by certain brief movements, while it partly retires from the internal region, and is dilated by the increase of the enamel- substance in thickness, and partly by folloAving the cur- vatures of the individual enamel-fibres along the sides and longitudinal direction of the tooth, experiences slight changes in its situation either in single or successive |Dor- tions. In those teeth of Avhich the crowns only are co- vered with enamel-substance, the enamel-membrane also does not extend beyond the crown itself, and there princi- pally the enamel-organ, like a hood, evidently unattached, can be separated from the dental germ. But in those teeth of which the growth has no fixed limit, as in the rodentia, in the tusks of the sow, in the pachyderms, &c., the ex- tent of the enamel is not so contracted ; and for this rea- son we are led to conclude, that from the beginning there are no such bounds of the enamel-membrane, nor any formation of a hood. Nay, in this case the enamel-mem- brane, especially after the eruption of the tooth, always

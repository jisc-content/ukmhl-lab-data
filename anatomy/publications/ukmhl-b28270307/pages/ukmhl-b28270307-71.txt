HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 49 of the root, and this statement is confirmed by Muller. The teeth have been reckoned by some amongst the cor- neous formations ; but though they grow in layers like the latter, still they contain no horn, as Muller has repeatedly satisfied himself, but true cartilage yielding glue. From the dental cartilage of a horse’s tooth, he obtained by boil- ing a large quantity of beautiful colourless glue. Whale- bone, and other corneous formations, which supply the place of teeth, consist, he has found, of true horn, and fur- nish no glue, however long they may be boiled. It would seem from this, that horn supplies the place of dental car- tilage when the teeth contain no deposition of calcareous earth. This is the case, at any rate, with the vertebrata. We now proceed to give an account of the late re- searches of Professor Retzius,* of Stockholm, which have excited so much attention, and thrown so much light on the structure of the teeth. He first exa- mined the cartilage in teeth which had been mace- rated in diluted muriatic acid, and found, on making- sections of it, that it appeared to consist of slightly un- dulating fibres lying close together, resting with one extremity against the cavity of the pulji, whilst the other terminated near the surface of the tooth. It was not till a subsequent period, he says, that he discovered that these were hollow; but in the meantime he ob- served no internal similarity between this cartilage and that of bone. He next procured, with the aid of a file, slices of tooth-bone as thin as writing-paper; increased their transparency by means of olive-oil and turpen- • The title of the work of Retziua is quoted above (p. 1): an excellent account of his discoveries was also published in Muller’s Archives, in 1837 and to this I have been greatly indebted in drawing up the following sketch.

114 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. strated, together witli those of the dental bone, by making slices of teeth which were still fixed in the alveoli. Prepa- rations made in this manner contained of course a portion of the alveolar bone, which, when it was filed as thin as the sections of the tooth,illustrated the internal structure of the dental hone. These tubes in hone itself had been shortly before found by Muller and Miescher, asalsoby Purkinje and Valentin. Miiller was the first who showed that they contained calcareous matter. They are still more minute in bone than in the tooth, and are many times smaller than the most minute blood-vessels, their thick- ness, according to Muller, being line p. m. {J. Mulleri Ohservationes de canaliculis corpusculorum ossium, atque de modo quo terrea materia in ossibus continetur.) They radiate from the minute medullary canals, which wei*e first more carefully examined by Purkinje, give off an abundance of branches which form reticular communications, and ter- minate in Purkinje’s corpuscula, or cells. I call them by the latter name, because I am convinced that they are excavations in the substance of cartilage as well as in that of hone, which partly contain a clear fluid, and partly de- posits of calcareous salts. The horns of deer are organised in nearly the same manner, with this difference only, that in them the minute medullary threads appear to be really blood-vessels, which view is most strongly confirmed by Berthold in his work, “ Ueher das Wachsthum, den Ah- “fall, und die Wiedererzeugung der Hirschgeweihe, in dessen “ Beitragen zur Anatomie, ^c.” Gottingen, 1831. “ The tubes in the dental bone open into the cavitas pul- pie, and give off branches in their course, which form a network of communication between each other, and which terminate in cells. These cells, together with the branches from the main tubes, nearly fill up the inter-

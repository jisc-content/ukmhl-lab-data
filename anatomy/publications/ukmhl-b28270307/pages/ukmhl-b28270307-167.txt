145 HiSTOniCAL INTRODUCTION. assumes the form of a girdle of greater or less breadth, which, surrounding the basilary part of the tooth, is continually being changed towards the crown into an osseous membrane, which is always arising anew about the root, and in the middle always depositing fresh enamel-substance. If, however, we regard the dilferent distribution of the enamel substance, in respect to quan- tity, over the surface of the dental substance in the dif- ferent kinds of teeth, and in the different classes of animals, we shall perceive that another peculiar circum- stance also contributes to the especial formation of the enamel-organ: respecting this, however, no accurate investigations have yet been made. There are two prin- cipal directions observable in the motions of the teeth with regard to each other, in grinding and breaking down food; the one perpendicular, in carnivorous, frugivorous, and insect-eating animalsâ€”the other hori- zontal, in the ruminantia, rodentia, and most of the pachyderms. To these directions in which the teeth are worn down, the distribution of the enamel on the dental substance corresponds. Where the tooth is worn in a perpendicular direction, the greatest quantity of enamel is deposited on the coronal plane, and also on the apex; but where it is worn in a horizontal direction, there exists, even at first, only a thin and easily pul- verized layer of enamel on the apex of the crown, but it is found in great abundance on the dental parietes, which are in various apposition to each other. This obtains principally with regard to the molar teeth ; the incisors and canines exhibiting but little difference, and their function being in all cases almost the same. To this dis- tribution of the enamel-substance, the first formation of the enamel-organ ought to correspond. In tlie first kind L

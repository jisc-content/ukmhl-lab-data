It is much to he regretted, moreover, that such talent as Hunter’s should have so long sanctioned by its high authority many practices which, to the present day, are adhered to, and which tend to a direct increase of suffering, and in some cases even to the gradual destruction of life. His errors can only he explained by the limited field of observation and practice on these organs which he enjoyed ; a wider range of expe- rience would soon have awakened his penetrating mind to a sense of the injurious nature of such practices, for instance, as “ extracting a decayed tooth,” in order to “ boil and replace it,” as applying the actual or other cautery to exposed nerves, where disease is present; burning the ear with hot iron to cure the tooth-ache ; blistering for decayed teeth, &c.

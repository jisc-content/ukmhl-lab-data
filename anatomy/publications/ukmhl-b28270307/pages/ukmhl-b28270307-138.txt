HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 116 form than in other parts. In this last formed osseous mass, the branches of the tubes are best shown, because both the former and the latter have no longer their paral- lel arrangement. In this irregular form of dental bone the largest cells are found, and the entrance of the tubes into the latter is admirably well seen, as also the reticular meshes formed by the tubes themselves. In many places this substance presents so great a similarity to other osseous formations, that it appears rather to belong to or- dinary bone than to dental bone; it differs, however, from the former in the larger size of its main tubes. “ In many animals the pulp is divided after the outer shell of the dental bone has been formed (c. g. in the brady- pus, trichechus, esox, gadus, anarrhichas, &c.) After this has taken place, particular layers are formed round the division of the pulp. The osseous substance which thus arises has a still greater similarity to ordinary osseous structure. The divisions of the pulp prolonged into fibres then show the strongest similarity to the medullary fibres in bones, and form in many cases, like the latter, lateral communications, (for instance, in the pristis, gadus, anarrhichas, &c.) In several animals, particularly in the trichechus, this form of dental bone presents the most evident similarity to proper bone. There are found in it medullary tubes, (canals of the pulp,) and me- dullary fibres, (fibres of the pulp,) round which groups of concentric layers have formed ; from these the minute tubes radiate, which in the different layers are as it were pieced together, and in these layers concentric rows or rings of cells are again found just as in bones. “ Tlie similarity between dental bone and real bone is lienee greater than one is inclined to believe after making the first microscopical researches. The greatest difference

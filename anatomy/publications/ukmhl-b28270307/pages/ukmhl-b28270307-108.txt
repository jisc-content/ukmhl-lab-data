86 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. giious ones: the larger branches were given off generally at an acute angle. It would have been doubtless interest- ing to have examined this substance in other parts, and particularly on the molar teeth ; but Retzius could not procure any preparation of these. Hippopotamus amphihius.—Of the hippopotamus, Retzius only examined the incisors, and for the investigation of their tubular structure, he chose here also slices which w'ere taken from the border of the hollow alveolar ex- tremity. The main tubes did not lie so close here as in the ele- phant, but are of about the same calibre. As in the latter animal, they are scarcely perceptibly undulating, but make on the other hand a number of parallel curvatures, which, however, are not so close together as in the elephant. The branches were somewhat more distinct than in the teeth of the latter. The small calcareous cells which occupy the greatest part of the intermediate spaces, are much more thinly scattered than in ivory : they are partly larger, and partly smaller. In fewer parallel curvatures appear such deposits of calcareous earth as contribute to form the concentric rings in the tooth of the hippopotamus ; on the other hand they formed a thick and constant layer on the entire surface of the tooth between the most exter- nal, minute branches, in which the ends of the main tubes terminate. The concentric rings in the tooth of the hippopotamus are not so regular as in ivory : they are more abrupt, are undulating, as it were, and arise principally from the re- fraction of the rays of light in the parallel curvatures. Rhinoceros Inclicus.—In the rhinoceros, Retzius had only the •ojiportunity of examining pieces cut longitudi- nally from the edge of the roots of a molar tooth. In

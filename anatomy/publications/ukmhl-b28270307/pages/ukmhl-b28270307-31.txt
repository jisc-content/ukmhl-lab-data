HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 9 made up of very small, strait, and transparent pipes. Six or seven hundred of these pipes put together, I judge, exceed not the thickness of one hair of a man’s beard. In the teeth of a cow, the same pipes appear much bigger, and in those of a haddock somewhat less.” Draw- ings of the teeth are given here, and also in his “ Continua- tio Epistolarum” which work contains the results of his researches on the teeth of the horse and the pig, which he likewise finds to consist of tubes proceeding from the cavity to the periphery. He here proves, too, that he was acquainted with the cortical substance, for, speaking of the teeth of the calf, he says, “ Undiquaque alio osse cir- cumducti erant—“ adeo ut jam me adhuc magis quam antea cerium reddere possem, circum primo confectum dentem os accrevisse," (p. 7.) He further speaks of crystals which he found in the cavities of the teeth of horses, and gives drawings of them. Strange to say, these statements at- tracted no attention either from his contemporaries or successors, though Portal, in his Histoire de I’Anatomie et de la Chirurgie (Paris, 1770, t. 3e p. 460,) cites the letter inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, observing ; “ Leeuwenhoek dit ici que les dents sont composees de tres petits tuyaux transparents et droits, dont six ou sept cents egalent h peine un poil de la barbe,” &c. In the “ Anatomia Plantarum” of Malpighi, (Op. omn. Lugd. Batav. 1687,) the fibres of the enamel are mentioned and delineated. In his Op. Posthum. (Amstel. 1698, p. 71 et seq.) he calls it a “ substantia ossea filamentosa,” and a “ crusta Candida filamentosa!' Speaking of the teeth of the calf, he says, “ interior (substantia) ossea est, et ohscu- ram hahet compositionem, quce in piscihus tamen evidenter fibrosa est ; in hominibus vero conq)acta valde.

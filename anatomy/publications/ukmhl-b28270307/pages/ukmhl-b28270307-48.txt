HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 26 internal membrane or pulp, causing suppuration, but not attended with decay in the solid substance of the tooth. In cases of this kind, he recommends a hole to be drilled in the side of the tooth to allow the escape of the matter. Under this head he observes, that the pulp in its diseased state is separated from the bone, (thus forming one of the causes of external decay,) but in its healthy state adheres firmly to it.

The remaining parts of Mr. Pox’s work are replete with sound and valuable information. In the article on artificial teeth, he observes of Mr. Hunter’s operation of transplanting, that “ he Avas naturally partial to it from its being of his own invention.” He is not, hoAvever, correct in this, as we have seen that Ambrose Pare al- luded to it two hundred years before Hunter.

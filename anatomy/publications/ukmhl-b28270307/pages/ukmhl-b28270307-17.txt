XI PREFACE. ferent organised structures, have been so well responded to by those who prepare them, that various structures have lately been brought within the range of our vision, of which the nature had hitherto been wrapped in obscurity, from our not having possessed the means of ocularly examining them. To these two causes united we may trace the splen- did contributions with which science has lately been enriched ; and it is principally on account of the interest excited by the writings of one of the labourers with the microscope, whose observations were made on the deli- cate sections above alluded to, that I have been induced to collect and publish my researches on this subject. In 1837, I learnt that Professor Retzius of Stockholm had published a very interesting series of microscopic in- vestigations on the structure of the teeth, and I then made every exertion to obtain his publication, but with- out success. I first saw it in April 1838, when I was fa- voured with a loan of it, by my learned friend. Dr. Grant. The interest excited by the new views of this intelligent and industrious Swedish physiologist, induced me to re- sume a course of investigations on all the points connect- ed with the structure of those organs, and I immediately announced my intention of publishing on the sub- ject, and pursued my investigations with assiduity. Not less than five years ago, I made many observations on the structure of the teeth, and saw at that time tlieir striated appearance; but being unable satisfac-

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 51 each other; * but when several distant ones are compared, they are found to radiate, as it were, from the cavity of the tooth. In a few parts only of the fully-developed tooth, and not constantly even in these parts, do the tubes proceed directly from the cavitas pulpee to the external surface: these parts are those which correspond to the apex or apices in the crown,d' and to the commencement of the inferior third of the root. In the other parts, most of the tubes assume more or less the form of a line with three curvatures, frequently resembling the Greek zeta. The central curvature points inferiorly or internally; the outer extremities of the tubes turn inwards towards the axis of the tooth, or towards its surface. Where the tubes are the shortest, which is the case near the end of the root, the central curve only is seen, and it is convex towards the surface. Sometimes a fourth curvature is observed, which has of course the same direction as the second ; but he only found it at the inner extremity of the tubes, where these were last formed or prolonged, in order to close gradually the cavity of the pulp. In some cases, towards the root, two curvatures are found ; the tube having then the form of any: the external one then points towards the root; still, by means of the microscope, another small curvature in the opposite direction is generally found at the extreme end, which is neither perceptible to the naked eye, nor by means of a ‘ loupe.’ The curvatures on both sides appear, in well-formed teeth, to present a certain sym- metry, so that the cavities on one side correspond to those on the other. See. Hence towards the middle of the crown, the central curvatures come te diverge, and those which point from within outwards to converge. The curvatures are found to be most regular in sections of the front teeth, cut • I’liitc A. 1. Fig. 2. b. -I- Pliilc A. ]. Fig. 2, c.

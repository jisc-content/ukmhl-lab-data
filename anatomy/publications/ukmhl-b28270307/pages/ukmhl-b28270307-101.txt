HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 79 together, that the space between two of them is no larger than the width of one of them : here Eetzius could dis- cover no branches; but about the middle of the course of the tubes, which at the sides of the tooth correspond to the central curve resembling an e, branches begin to be seen, some presenting the appearance of small, trans- versely-running streaks, which are bent inwards ; others being longer, and, as it were, stretched out. As the tubes proceed towards the surface, the branches become more and more numerous, are most plentiful on the convex sides of the main tubes, though in several places they are equally numerous on both sides, and frequently form very acute angles with the main tubes. Hence most of the branches lie closer, as it were, to the main tubes, than in the above-mentioned animals. On the external side of the tooth the branches ran in almost opposite directions. Under a three-hundred-and-fifty-times magnifying power, the most delicate branches appeared to be as close together as the filaments in down. In several places the minuter branches seemed to terminate in small angular cells, similar in appearance to the small cal- careous cells in bones. These cells were particularly numerous in the external part of the tooth, and most so immediately beneath the enamel, where the greatest num- ber of minute branches terminate. These minute branches wind between the calcareous cells, and terminate partly in them. There were also found here a number of ex- tremely minute passages, running from cell to cell, and forming an anastomosing net-work, between the branches as well as between the calcareous cells. (See Plate A. 3. Fig- 6.) These calcareous cells are much more minute than those which are found in bone.

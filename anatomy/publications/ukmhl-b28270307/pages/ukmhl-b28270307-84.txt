62 HISTOniCAL INTRODUCTION. consists of cartilage and osseous earth. From the car- tilage of human teeth, of which the osseous earth has been dissolved in acid, the cartilage of the cortical substance may he separated in the form of a membrane, which is thickest at the end of the root; in human teeth it appears to have less consistence than the cartilage of dental hone. Viewed under the microscope, it presents the same cel- lules or so called corpuscula as the proper osseous sub- stance, dental bone, and most cartilaginous structures. It was less easily dissolved in boiling water than that of dental hone, and retained several earthy granules after those of the latter had all disappeared. When either recent or dried cortical substance, polished or in fine slices, is examined with a good lens, a number of white, crowded points, almost invisible to the naked eye, are discovered in it, which, on being further magnified, show themselves to be the cells above-mentioned, deriving their white colour from the osseous matter they contain. As in dental and common bone, numerous tubes pass into and from them, widening as they enter, and giving them the ap- jaearance of irregular stars. These tubes have numerous communications Avith each other, partly direct, and partly by means of branches lifeoto ssnra of a line p. m. in diameter: some of them pass immediately from one cell to another, precisely as in the dental bone. The osseous cells are of various forms and sizes; some are elongated, so as to look almost like tubes; some are nearly round : their average size Ritzius found to be tss line p. m. In sections made transversely to the axis of the tooth, it is plainly seen that the osseous cells are arranged in parallel lines or con- centric rings, some fainter than others, or that the cortical substance is deposited in delicate, coherent layers. In Ihe human tooth the cortical stdistance is an ex-

165 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. or denying- them. All that I wish to do at present is, to show that further research, more varied experiments, and a more rigid examination of the subject in all its depart- ments and hearings, are absolutely required before the doctrine of a tubular system can be considered as immu- tably established. The sketch which I have given of the progress of in- formation in this department of science shows that many interesting branches of the subject are still uncultivated, and that, though many remarkable points connected with the structure have recently been started, mechanical ana- lysis alone has been resorted to for their elucidation, and that, too, as I have already mentioned, without sufficient attention to the nature of the structures submitted to obser- vation, or to the kind of manipulations adopted for their preparation. I feel confident that even the method of mechanical analysis hitherto pursued is still capable of great improvement, and that it would have been consi- derably modified by Professor Retzius, had he been able to devote further attention to the subject. Having com- menced my experiments where his terminate, I think I may say that a year and a halfâ€™s constant attention to the subject has much improved and facilitated my means of observation, and has led me to new and important re- sults. One of the greatest chemists of the present day has promised me an analysis of the structures entering into the composition of the teeth throughout the range of the animal kingdom, which when completed will furnish a valuable accession to our knowledge of these organs. I have also myself had recourse to chemical decomposi- tion, which has yielded me no little assistance in unra- velling the texture of these organs.

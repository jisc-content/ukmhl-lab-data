PREFACE. VI to tlie wants and instincts of the latter. Indeed, from their peculiar conformation, they indicate so exactly the type of animal to which they belong, that they are found to fur- nish the best characteristic marks by which to classify the members of the animal kingdom. Their importance, therefore, in a scientific point of view, is very great, the aid which they afford to the naturalist being precise and definite: they have held a prominent place in all classifi- t cations of animals, and Brisson adopted them exclusively as his guide in this department of his labours. Such is the beautiful harmony of Nature, that the information ac- quired by means of these organs puts us at once in posses- sion of a knowledge of many of the anatomical peculiari- ties and distinguishing habits of the animals to which they respectively belong. Moreover, the enduring na- ture of the materials which enter into their structure can- not but give them additional value in the eyes of the Geo- logist. Cuvier, whose scientific research was at once remark- able for its elevation, and for the grandeur and breadth of contemplation which it displayed, has widened by his pro. found labours the field of physical philosophy; he has lit torches in the abyss of time, to guide us in our inquiries into the past, which were they zealously prosecuted, â€˜ man, to whom only a momentary sojourn on earth has been accorded, would have the glory of unfolding the history of the thousands of centuries which have preceded

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 37 Pie concludes liis work by a ratlier lengthy enumera- tion of supposed examples of third sets of teeth, and of other irregularities. Generally speaking, his pathological remarks, such as those respecting stumps, do not accord with the results of practical observation. The genius of Baron Cuvier not only displayed itself in his own discoveries, but in the facilities which it opened to the researches of others. Two works on the teeth have originated with his scholars, both of which confer great honour on their authors. The first of these ap- peared in 1825, and is entitled, â€œ On the Teeth of the Mammalia considered as Zoological Characters^ by F, Cuvier: a work forming a most useful and interesting accession to our knowledge of natural history. The illus- trations are executed with great care and fidelity, and form a perfect text-book of reference. The work is pre- ceded by a most valuable dissertation on the develope- ment and structure of the teeth, replete with sound sense and accurate observation. The author considers the teeth as appendages to the skin, and as analogous in some re- spects to the other dermal appendages, inasmuch as they are secreted by somewhat similar organs ; and also, in- asmuch as they may be said to be dead, being devoid of vessels and nerves, and consequently insensible. But, though they resemble dermal productions in these re- spects, he does not think that they ought to be included in the same category, seeing that they still differ from them in some essential particulars. According to him, the Ornithorynchus possesses the most simple teeth, for in this animal tliey are entirely composed of gelatine. The next in order have a gelatinous base with earthy salts deposited in their meshes. These two forms, simple

IIISTOUICAL INTRODUCTION. 72 somewliat as the jets of a fountain. These tubes are not uniform : some are dilated in one place, and immediately afterwards contracted, or are large in one part and small in another. They give off several larger and less irre- gularly winding branches: between them is here and there a cavity, into which delicate winding passages open, just as the small winding passages terminate in the cal- careous cavities in the more delicate structure of bone. Finer tubes, similar to those usually found in dental bone, are given off from the larger ones, and are continued as far as the shell which is composed of the firmer white dental substance. The larger tubes, too, terminate in the more regularly arranged tubes which belong to that substance; but precisely at this junction they become minute nearly of a sudden, make at the same time two particularly definite curvatures, and then nearly straight run in an oblique direction ; some towards the crown, and some towards the sides of the tooth. That portion of the tubes situated in the above-named white substance, may be regarded as analogous to the tubes in the dental bone of other teeth, and have the same diameter as the corresponding tubes in the human subject. The most perceptible branches are seen in the white substance near the junction above alluded to : they run nearly at right angles to the axis of the tooth : a part of the branches turn towards the crown, others towards the root of the tooth to which they belong. In the crown they appear, at their outer extremities too, as plainly ramifying ; but besides, under a three hundred to a four hundred times magnifying power, these main tubes, so to call them, which belong to the white substance, are as it were covered with a downy net-work, comjiosed of extremely minute tubuli, of Avhicb tlie further course could not

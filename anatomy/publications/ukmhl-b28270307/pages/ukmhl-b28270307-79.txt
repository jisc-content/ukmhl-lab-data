HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 57 perforated in every part, but it showed no trace of fibres. In the fossil teeth of this horse, Retzius had an oppor- tunity of observing the difierent degrees of durability of the different parts of the tooth. The cortical substance of the external side of the teeth had fallen off altogether : in the recesses its texture was so loose that it crumbled aAvay as soon as it was touched. The dental bone was also, for the most part, destroyed : that which remained was very friable, and resembled brown velvet. It was separated, as it were, into fibres of a loose texture, which ran in the same directions as the tubes. The greatest part of the residue of the tooth consisted consequently of the enamel, and this had the same crystalline appearance, and the same hardness as in a dried, recent tooth. This fact again tends to jirove that the enamel is very slightly organised, and that it contains very little organic matter. When very recent, however, it seems to present an exception to this rule ; for if the loose enamel, which has as yet only attained a slight degree of consistence, be separated from the tooth whilst the latter is still in its sac, or, better still, from the root of a young horse-tooth, it can be easily dis- solved, and falls partly into irregular pieces, and partly into extremely delicate prisms. Wlien recently-formed enamel is submitted to the action of diluted muriatic acid, every delicate prism leaves behind on itssolution a small portion of organic matter : but as this cannot be found at a later period, it is probably only a deposit from the moisture, whicli in the first place sur- rounded the enamel fibres. These latter are still invested by this organic deposit when they arc first arranged toge- ther ; but as they become closer pressed, and new ones are wedged in between them to form the hard enamel of

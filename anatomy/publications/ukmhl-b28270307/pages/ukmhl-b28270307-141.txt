In common bone, probably, the peculiar vessels in question take a part in the continual, or apparently continual, ex- change of substance : this cannot in the same degree be the case in dental bone, inasmuch as in this no such exchange appears to take place. What end then is served by this beautiful organisation of the dental bone ? We have many examjoles that nature organises structures which have a close affinity to each other according to one and the same plan, and hence we have, in different parts or organisms, formations, which in some are of the greatest importance, whilst in others they are of much less functional significance, or of none whatever. If we hence assume, what is highly probable, that in bone the peculiar vessels in question give passage to fluids during the entire life of the animal (or a great part of it) —which fluids contain the solid as well as the liquid materials of the osseous substance—it does not necessa- rily follow, that the same process must be carried on in the teeth during the whole of life. On the contrary, I am inclined to believe that these vessels in dental bone are at their height during the first period of the formation of the tooth, and exercise then their more perfect action. At the same time, the existence of a continual vital process in the tooth as well as in the crystalline lens cannot be de- nied, which, however, appears to be carried on without any constant exchange of solid matter, and must hence consist in a renovating circulation of the dental fluids. I refer here to an observation of G. II. Weber, published several years ago, and before the existence of the peculiar vessels in question was suspected;—“ The tooth appears “ then to be penetrated by fluids secreted by the dental “ germ, and by the membrane surrounding the root ex-

130 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. solved and ran into the fibres, the intermediate jelly play- ing here a more subordinate part. “According to Meckel, the commencement of ossification is marked about the middle of pregnancy by the appearance of thin, delicate, elastic bodies (scherbchen,) which become gradually thicker and firmer. They correspond at first to the apices of the future teeth, and soon become thicker and harder*on the masticating surface, v^hilst the tooth is still short, (being without a neck,) and hollow internally. As the tooth grows thicker, its cavity diminishes, and the / dental germ disappears. The enamel is formed from the inner surface of the internal membrane (or leaf,) and is deposited on the osseous substance of the tooth. Its con- nexion with the tooth is tolerably loose in the foetus. The period of its formation is the same as that of the tooth itself. “With respect to the individual teeth, those of the lower jaw are formed earlier than those of the upper. First appear the two incisor teeth, then two molar teeth, and after them the canine in each half of the jaw, which col- lectively belong to the milk-teeth. Near them are shortly developed the sacs for the permanent teeth, which at first are seated on the sacs of the milk-teeth, are after- wards removed from these, and only connected with them by a thread, whilst they penetrate deeper into the jaw. (See Burdach’s Phys. ii. 8. 475.) Hunter describes three cen- tres of ossification in the incisor teeth, in the small molars two or three, in the large molars four or five, and in the canine one. Rudolphi describes two in the canine, whilst Cloquet states that there is only one in all the teeth ; and Albinus, Blake, and Serres, assert that there is only one in the incisors. According to Meckel, the incisois and canines have only one germ, the molars, oii the other

115 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. slices between the latter. Tlie breadth of the main tubes varies from ijs to lAn of a line, p. m., and diminishes as they divide into branches : the most minute subdivisions are many times smaller than ions of a p. line. It is very likely that the tubes and cells which are seen under the micro- scope form but a small portion of those which really exist. “The dental bone, as Cuvier and several others have de- scribed, is deposited layer by layer round the surface of the pulp, and the most external layer is that which is first deposited. During this process the most external closely contiguous cells have their origin, and also the periphe- ral extremities of the main tubes. During the formation of successive layers, the latter are also continued inwards; and it would seem as if their parallel curvatures were produced during their continuation from one layer into another. In this case we have grounds for presuming that there is a periodical motion of the pulp, by means of which the tubes, whilst in process of formation, are at one time pushed towards the apex of the tooth, and at ano- ther drawn down and in the direction of its root. We may also imagine the periodical motion to be of various kinds. The most delicate and most numerous undulating curvatures must be the work of very short periods. The longer, shallower curves, of which every fully developed tube presents only a few, may be regarded as marks of other and slower periodical changes in the formation of the pulp, during which those producing the short tubular undulations are carried on uninterruptedly. “These processes,however, are only carried on with com- plete regularity before the tootli protrudes through the gums. In the extremities of the roots, and in the osseous mass filling up the centre of the cavitas pulpae, which are subsequently formed, the tubes are less regular and uni-

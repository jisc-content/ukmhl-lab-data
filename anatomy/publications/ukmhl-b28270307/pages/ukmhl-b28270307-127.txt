105 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tubes. Tlie larger main tubes which occupy the internal more imperfect part of the dental bone, are in their widest parts about p. m. in diameter. They run almost parallel with each other, and with the axis of the tooth, and form with each other numerous larger and smaller anas- tomoses. Near the base of the firmly-fixed teeth, the larger trans- verse anastomoses are so near to each other, that the in- terstices are scarcely as wide as the diameter of the larger tubes. In some few recent teeth these tubes contained here and there a blood-red substance, and may hence be regarded as divisions of a cavity of the pulp. Remark- ably beautiful and very short tubes of sk to Wns p. m. in breadth, are given ofiâ€œ from the large main trunks, gene- rally in a transverse direction; most divide immediately after their origin into extremely minute bundles, of which the ramifications enter into innumerable reticular com- munications with each other, filling up also the inter- stices between the larger tubes. In the passage from this internal dental substance with large tubes to the outer one in which the tubes are minute, a particular simple extension of the tubular structure is observable, formed by the anastomoses of the terminations of the main tubes, wliich are straiglit at their extremities, but arched pre- viously, and which constitute, as it were, the boundary between the external and internal dental substance. From these larger border-tubes are given off more minute, short, tubular trunks, which follow nearly the direction from the above-mentioned boundary outwards, as the small tubes in the more recent, thin-walled, hollow shells of the crown in more perfect teeth, which run from their large cavity of the pulp externally towards the surface. Here too those wliich are next to the apex run almost parallel

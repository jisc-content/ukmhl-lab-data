HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 118 the walrus surrounds the substance which is similar to pudding-stone. It might hence be said that a tooth with a simple pulp is analogous to an osseous fibre from the interior of bone, or to the most external, concentric layers of a bone which surround the whole. “ It can scarcely be doubted that the minute tubes in dental bone, in the cortical substance, in common bone, and in the horns of deer, as well as the cells M^hich are united with them, are a peculiar kind of vessels, contain- ing a nourishing and supporting fluid, of which probably the composition differs at different periods. This fluid is most likely secreted by the capillary vessels which clothe the surface of the pulp. In common bone in which the minute tubes open into the medullary canals, this secretion probably takes place after the hollow os- seous fibres have been formed, in a great part from the surface of the medullary fibres enclosed in the cavity of the osseous fibres, whilst the minute tubes collect round them in a radiating manner. “ In the horns of deer, in which the blood-vessels occupy in a great measure the place of the medullary fibres and of the minute medullary tubes, the same minute osseous vessels are seen radiating from the parietes of the minute canals which contain these blood-vessels. “That the small osseous tubes and cells contain osseous earth is seen from their whiteness, which disappears when the preparation is laid in diluted muriatic acid, in which afterwards the calcareous salts are precipitated, the pre- viously white and dark osseous tubes and cells being rendered cpiite colourless and clear, after having been submitted to the action of the acid. These calcare- ous salts were ju’obably left behind in the tubes from the first formation of the dental lione, and deposited them-

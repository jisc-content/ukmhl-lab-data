HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 27 Avork are found incorporated all the facts known at the time, and many excellent practical considerations. He is of opinion that teeth are true bone. “ That they possess vitality, and are connected by their organisation Avith the general system, having nerves, blood-vessels, and absorbents, and are analogous in this respect to true bone,” is his expressed opinion.* He considers the mem- brane of the pulp to be a production of the periosteum of the alveolus. The adhesion existing between the mem- brane and the bone of the tooth he considers is owing to the passage of “ numerous vessels, &c., from the one to the otherand he shows throughout the whole of his work that he is a most strenuous advocate for a degree of vitality in the teeth equal to bone, and ad- duces as a proof of that opinion the red tinge in the teeth of persons who have died of strangulation. He considers that “ the periosteum of the maxillary bones, after covering the alveolar processes, dips doAvn into each alveolar cavity, the parietes of which it lines. From the bottom of the cavity where the vessels and nerve of the internal membrane enter, it appears to be reflected over the root of the tooth, which it entirely covers as far as the neck, at which part it becomes intimately connected with the gum.”f The ivory of the tooth, he considers, is a secretion from the ni^mhrane of the pulp, and not from the pulp itself; and agrees with Dr. Blake in “ conjectur- ing this membrane to be a propagation of the periosteum of the jaw.” He agrees with Fox regarding the vascularity of both layers of the capsule, and that the external layer secretes the crusta petrosa. He divides the membranes of the teeth generally into deciduous and persistent; “the deciduous being the two lamellfe of the capsule; and * Page 9. t Page 42.

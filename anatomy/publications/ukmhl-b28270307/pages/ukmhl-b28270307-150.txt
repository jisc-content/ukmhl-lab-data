128 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. The openings of the remaining sacs are soon closed liy the mucous membrane of the mouth. “ The sacs of the permanent teeth are also formed im- mediately from the mucous membrane of the mouth, partly at the fourth month of foetal existence, partly to- ward the end of that period, partly at birth. Once only, in a new-born child, I observed behind the most promi- nent edge of the gums several openings, which led to the sacs of the incisives and canines, and which are usually already obliterated before birth.” Valentin* says, “ The dental border of the upper and lower jaw thickens at a very early period in the ruminan- tia and in pigs, when the embryo is more than an inch long ; in man, in the first half of the third month. In this border arise a series of oval, fibrous vesicles, which at first lie close together, and are separated from each other by a compact granular substance. This increases and is separated more and more, and runs through the above-mentioned stages to ossify in the form of alveoli, where the vesicles come into close contact with it. Within every vesicle is formed, probably somewhat later than this, the sac of the tooth, which, according to the general opinion, is in no way connected with the mucous membrane of the mouth. But according to Arnold, on the other hand, the entire sac is formed from this mucous membrane dipping into the groove in the upper and lower jaw.” The subsequent details on this subject given by Valentin are so interesting that I cannot abstain from quoting them. “ The dental sacculus itself consists of two membranes; of which, according to Hunter, only the inner one, ac- * Enlxoickelungsgeschichle des Alenschen, p. 482.

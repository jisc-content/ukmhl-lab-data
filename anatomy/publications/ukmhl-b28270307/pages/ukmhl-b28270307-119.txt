97 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. lar distinctness. The former is best seen nearer the root, inasmuch as at every division of the main tube the new branches curve somewhat away from each other, whilst those in the part nearer the crown part straighter and at more acute angles. The small lateral branches run in the greatest abun- dance from both sides of the main tubes and their divi- sions, generally in transverse arches, of which a part cross over the nearest tubes and interstices beyond. The outer extremities of the main tubes are distributed in bundles into the surface of the dental bone, next to the enamel and cortical substance, in extreme minuteness and abun- dance, and also into the thick layer which is there situated, of minute, angular, calcareous cells. Such cells were found almost everywhere in the dental bone of the dolphin. In the teeth which Retzius examined were found, immediately within the external surface of the dental bone, several white streaks, which were present in the entire circumference of the tooth, and which were entirely formed by such closer, partly very large and angular calcareous cells, some of which ran into each other, whilst others were in communication with the minute extremities of the tubes. Round the medullary canal there were here, as well as in many of the above-described teeth, oval tracts where the main tubes had been supplanted by peculiar and, as it were, more independent tubular structures. The main tubes round about these clear, oval tracts surrounded them in curves, and gave off thinly scattered branches which wound amongst them from all sides : a part of the tubes were at their terminations, as it were, pyriformally dilated into calcareous cells, which by intermediate tubes again communicated with other cells of triangular and

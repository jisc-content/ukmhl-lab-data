68 IIISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. are scarcely wider than the diameter of a single tube ; hut towards the root they are further apart, and tlie branches are seen here more particularly to turn towards the root. In the roots only is the direction of the main tubes transverse ; near the masticating surface, they ap- proach the direction of the axis of the tooth. Of the rami- fying tubes near the root, in a dens incisivus major of a hare, a drawing is given, Plate A. 2. Fig. 2. a. The most inferior tube, Fig. 2. h, is isolated from the rest in order that it may he represented more clearly. In the longitudinal streaks running in the direction of the axis of the tooth, which give to some of these teeth an appearance as if they were composed of cones contained one within ano- ther, (See Heusinger Histologie, Part I. Fasciculus 2nd, p. 200,) 'no certain curvature of the tubes could he dis- cerned, nor any evident corpuscnles, or osseous cells, hut only thin layers of a connected, whiter, more opaque sub- stance. In the singularly constructed molar teeth of the beaver and of several other rodentia, the tubes in the proper dental bone are just as regular, and present the same forms, and the same ramifications, as in the incisor teeth. In the heaver and hare the cortical substance was only found on the molar teeth, where it exists principally in the furrows which the enamel and the dental bone inter- nally make towards the cavity of the pulp. The cells in this cortical substance were extremely irregular in the beaver; some held h line p. m. ; some were five or six times larger: some of the fine tubes radiated from a centre, others were parallel; but the jf-arallel ones ran in more various directions. On the external side of the molar teeth of the beaver an extremely fine layer of cor- tical substance was recognised ; on the other hand, the

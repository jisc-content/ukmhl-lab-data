HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 101 turn are trunks; all brandies in the crown of the tooth run outwards towards the periphery ; and in the remain- ing part they are given off by that side of the main tubes which is nearest the root. These branches are given off almost parallel, and at very acute angles. Some of them are thicker than others, and they correspond to the main divisions in other teeth. They also give off numerous branches, which, however, run parallel with the others. This parallelism gives to the dental bone of the python, seen through the microscope, a very peculiar appearance (Plate A. 3. Pig. 6). In the surface alone appeared a faint trace of osseous cells. Spams 'Rondeletii and Balistes Vetula.â€”In the limited number of fish-teeth, examined by Retzius, he found the dental bone of the spams rondeletii and halistes vetula to resemble most in jioint of internal structure that of the mammalia and amjihibia, inasmuch as in these fish it is white and hard like ivory, and displays, when viewed un- der the microscope, beautiful, regular, minute, and parallel main tubes. In the Spams Rondeletii the diameter of the tubes in the incisor teeth, near their commencement, is suW" p. m. They are tolerably regular and closely undulating, with several larger and smaller parallel curvatures. Internally towards the cavity of the pulp in the crown, they were very and irregularly winding. They divide at acute angles, and the branches lie so close to the trunks from which they have been given off, that their divisions are scarcely visible, with the exception of those which rise nearest their outer extremities, in the neighbourhood of the external surface of the tooth. The osseous cells were very indis- tinct. The coating of enamel was thick, light brownish, and traversed by innumerable minute furrows, running

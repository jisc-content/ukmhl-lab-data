HISTOniCAIi INTRODUCTION. 167 our ideas on the developement of these parts is such, that we must not be surprised that some of their diseases are not well understood, are often found very untractahle, and run frequently into a malignant state. It appears to me to be certain, that the external peri- osteum sends a continuation to line the cavity of the alve- olus simply, and that the fang of the tooth continues invested by the original capsule. We have seen that all writers on the Anatomy and Physiology of the Teeth have discussed the question, whether these organs are to be regarded as positively belonging to the osseous systejn, or whether they are to be considered as productions of the tegumentary mem- brane. The explanation of many of the peculiarities connected with the diseases of infancy, depends on a proper solution of this difficult question. The origin and nature of decay in the teeth, and its treatment, as well as many other points, cannot be satisfactorily dis- cussed before this subject is settled. Authorities here again are almost equally divided, and indeed no depart- ment of the science of odontology has given rise to a greater number of conflicting statements than we here encounter at its very commencement. Ambrose Pare considered the teeth to be vascular, and liable like other bones to inflammation and suppuration. Leeuwenhoek, in 1678, suspected them to be vascular or endowed with vitality, as he considered them to be com- posed of “ small, straight, and transparent pipes.” Monro, Hunter, Blake, and Fox regard them as bone. Monro, however, is undecided as to their vitality. Hunter thinks that they have “ no circulation, hut a vital principle.” Blake believes it to be “ incontestable” that vessels, both “ circulatory” and others, are present in the tooth, and

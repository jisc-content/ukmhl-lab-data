152 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. periods, have come to conclusions of a correspondingly limited character. It is no easy matter to accomplish a complete investigation of the developement of the teeth, and more particularly in man, from the great difficulty in obtaining an adequate supjily of subjects at a sufficiently early stage; in short, it cannot be denied that no de- partment of anatomy is more complicated, and that none presents more difficulties to the investigator than the ana- tomy and physiology of the teeth: none, however, on the other hand, is more fraught with interest to the investi- gator of minute, organic structure. Let us now attempt to test the value of our present in- formation, by inquiring what assistance it is able to afford us in practice.â€”In treating the urgent symptoms attendant on dentition, a knowledge of the true nature of the cap- sule, the pulp, and the surrounding parts, is required. On these points one of the latest inquirers is Arnold, whose observations tend to prove that the early stage of dental developement presents an open follicle of the mucous mem- brane, which afterwards closes and becomes the capsule. The observations of Arnold have been contradicted by Raschkow and Valentin, and again corroborated with many circumstantial details by Mr. Goodsir, published in the Edinb. Med. Journ. for Jan. 1839. This subject may therefore be considered to be still suh judice. With respect to the capsule itself, some writers con- tend that it consists of two layers ; others, that it is com- posed of one layer only. Some maintain that both its layers are vascular; others that vessels are exclusively found in the external layer; and others, again, that they are dis- covered only in the internal one. Many authors assert that the capsule has also the office of a periosteum; whilst in several works we find it stated, that the latter consists

HISTOBICAL INTRODUCTION. 113 gation of this department of science would be a labour of several years, and would fill a large volume, I confess, too, that my observations can make no pretensions to in- fallibility, which can only be attained in proportion as experiments are made with exactness and repeatedly va- ried. According to my experience, it is by varying expe- riments continually, that light is most easily thrown upon obscure phenomena. Hence, as long as I confined my observations to the teeth of the human subject, I over- looked the osseous cells which are so important towards obtaining a knowledge of the dental bone ; the divisions of the tubes also escaped me for a long time, as did also their highly interesting ramifications, &c. I cannot there- fore regard the present communication as anything more than a foundation for future inquiries, and I submit it to the eye of the public, in order that it may be strictly ex- amined and brought to perfection. I have found the sub- ject so important, and its examination has given me so much satisfaction, that I ardently hope to find a future opportunity to correct a portion of the defects which I have already discovered. In the mean time some gene- ral results may be drawn from the facts which I have related, and the comparison of them with observations on similar structures. These results are as follows ;— “ The teeth of mammalia consist in general of three substances, the dental bone, the enamel, and the cortical substance. These three substances form also the teeth in certain amphibia and fishes. The dental bone contains tubes and cells which are in communication with each other, and which are analogous to the minute tubes and cells forming an important part of the organisation of bone. “ Tlie minute tubes in the osseous substance I demon- 1

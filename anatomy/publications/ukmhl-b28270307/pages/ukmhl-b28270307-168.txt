146 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. of direction of the teeth, the principal mass of the paren- chyma ought to be found at the coronal apex ; but in the other kind, partly on the parietes of the tooth, partly in the coronal fossae, (in the runiinantia and in horses,) partly also in the lateral recesses of the tooth (in the roden- tia)—but on this point no accurate investigations have ' yet been made. “We see from the foregoing that the dental substance is formed in an opposite direction to the enamel. For in the one case the pulji of the dental germ is covered with the fibres of the dental substance, and, after it has depo- sited a layer, recedes from the external to the internal re- gion : this substance, therefore, increases from the cir- cumference towards the centre; but the contrary takes place in the deposition of the enamel. Its first layer which touches the dental substance is most internal, whilst each subsequent one approaches nearer the periphery, towards which the enamel membrane recedes. The direction of this, therefore, is from the centre to the circumference. The formation of the dental substance has a more organic character; and in some respects reminds us of the formation of osseous substance, from w'hich, however,, it still greatly differs. The formation of the enamel, on the -other hand, is of a more mineral character. It may best be compared to the secretion of the calcareous shell in the duct of the egg of the bird, which Hunter has already touched upon. It would be altogether false, however, to regard it as a true process of crystallisation, for its fibres are curved in various ways, and are arranged with an organic object: moreover, no small quantity of organic matter is contained in its sub- stance ; and the absence of all the strict lines of crystal- lisation, as well as the mode in whicli the fibres are seve-

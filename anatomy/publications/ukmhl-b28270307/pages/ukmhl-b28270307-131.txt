109 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. of the alveolus. The osseous substance which lies be- tween it and the teeth, is peculiarly porous, and has on both sides small furrows which correspond to the interstices of the teeth, and which give to this basilary substance, as it may be called, an appearance as if it were divided into as many processes as there are teeth fixed upon it. This appearance is also strengthened by the circumstance, that at the end of each of the above-mentioned furrows, next to the boundary of the dentigerous bone which resem- bles the border of the alveolus, the round orifices of small cavities are found, which contain sacks for the reserve- teeth, and some of them also reserve-teeth themselves nearly fully developed. These alveolar orifices, of which one is situated near the end of each interdental furrow, and consequently before each dental interstice, chiefly contribute to give an appearance to the above-mentioned basilary part of the dentigerous bone, as if it were divided into as many processes as there are teeth. Whence Cuvier derived the idea that these portions of bone supplied the place of the teeth after the latter had been shed, and that they themselves are finally changedâ€”this, says Retzius, I am not at all able to ex- plain, for in the numerous heads of the anarrhichas which I have examined, I never found any teeth wanting, though I have seen them very much worn away. The longest and most anterior teeth in the inter-maxillary bones, and those which correspond to them in the inferior maxilla, have most the appearance of being situated on peculiar osseous processes, which, in connexion with their teeth, have a distant resemblance to the place where the horns of the deer are fastened on the bone beneath, and this similarity has been noticed both by Cuvier and Von Rorn. The latter has given a faithful drawing of the beautiful circle of folds, which is seen on the spot where the tooth

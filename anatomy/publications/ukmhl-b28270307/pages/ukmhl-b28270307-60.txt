HISTOmCAL INTRODUCTION. 38 as they are, differ essentially from horn or hair; and he considers them as true secretions from organs destined for the purpose. In common with his brother, he regards them as distinct from bone; but at the same time he admits that they are more similar to the latter than to either hair or horn. To whatever set of appendages they may be considered as analogous, the teeth, he says, consist of a secreting and a secreted portion, at their origin as well as during their whole life. The secreting organ, composed essentially of vessels and nerves, is always placed internally, and is com- posed of three, or at least two, other organs. Around this is deposited the secreted portion, formed of a certain num- ber of substances entirely non-vascular, and removed from all immediate connexion with the system at large. It can be demonstrated, he continues, by mechanical ana- lysis, that only three substances enter into the composi- tion of all the different classes of teeth. One class con- sists of ivory, enamel, and “ corticala second, of ivory and enamel; a third, of ivory and cortical; a fourth, of ivory alone. The two kinds of fangs he designates as real and apparent. His views on the capsule are as follows :—“ It appears to be a production of the maxillary nerves and vessels ; but it is not without relation to the contiguous parts, being even connected with the gum, but to a much less extent than most authors have stated.” He calls this a secondary attachment, but has not had an opportunity of examining it at an early stage of developement. The capsule, he states, is adapted to the nature of the tooth which is to be formed from it. Thus teeth which are composed of three substances, have capsules divided into three distinct portions, each of which is to be considered

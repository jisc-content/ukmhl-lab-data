HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 30 have only ascertained the existence of their germs at a late period of foetal life ; hut I have thought it necessary to examine them at as early a period as possible.” “ In the jaws of an embryo of two months, I found the germs of the first incisors and small molars; hut I could not find the canine till two months and a half; at three months I discovered the germs, not only of the first, hut also of the second dentition, and even that of the wise tooth. These germs are found lodged in membranous folds, which form at this period the gum; those of the first dentition are immediately attached to this fold; those of the second are suspended from it hy a pedicle of about two lines long, which alone enables them to he distin- guished, together with the yellow colour which they con- tract hy exposure to the air, and which contrasts with the dull white of the gum. At four months I found fibrous partitions separating the incisors; hut all the other germs were contiguous to each other. At six months the osseous partition of the incisors was very distinct; that of the small molar was also partly ossified; and the two poste- rior molars were contained in the same division.” He gives a very circumstantial account of the position of these germs, and of the mode of demonstrating them, which consists in detaching them from the internal por- tion of the alveolar arch. He comes to the conclusion that he has “ demonstrated the presence of all the germs in the jaws of the foetus.” (P. 9.) He states that he has insulated all the pulps of the first set in the jaws of a foetus without disturbing either the capsule or the gums, and concludes that the pulp and the capsule “ quoiqu’ intimement unies sont distinctes Tune de I’autre.” (P. 11.)

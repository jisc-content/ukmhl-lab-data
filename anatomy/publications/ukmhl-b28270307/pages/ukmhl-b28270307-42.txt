20 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. With regard to the phenomena of dentition, he asserts that, previous to the eruption of the teeth, the jaws of the fcetus seem to be of a uniform continuous texture; but when they are examined internally, the dental capsule is Tound to be a shut sac lining the alveolar cavity to which it adheres by prolongations. It leaves the alveolus where the vessels enter the pulp, and is reflected on the latter, forming an envelope for the vessels. In its general character he considers this membrane to be serous, as also from the manner in which it is reflected, and from the fluid which it secretes. Although the pulp and its vessels are covered by it, they are, he says, really without its proper cavity. M. Blandin, the intelligent editor of Bichat’s “ Gene- ral Anatomy,” has published a very excellent treatise on the teeth, in which are incorporated his observations on these organs, appended to the last edition of Bichat. Con- trary to the opinion of the latter, he holds that the teeth are not bone, but productions of mucous membrane, ana- logous to nails, hair, &c., and differing from bone in their external position, connexions, form, structure, develojje- ment, and uses. He considers that “ the follicle of these osteides, after their eruption, bears a perfect analogy to that of a hair, and in fact is continuous near the neck with the common integument of the mouth, of which it ought to be regarded as a simple depression. Before the extrusion of the tooth this analogy exists positively, but is not very clear, and has been mistaken,” he adds, “by Bichat, who represents the membrane proper to the follicle as forming a shut sac ; whereas at present, and indeed since the work on this subject of M. Delabarre, it is acknow- ledged that the dental follicle is united at the gum to the

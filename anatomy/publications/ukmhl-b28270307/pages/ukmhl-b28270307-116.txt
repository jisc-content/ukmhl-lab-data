HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 94 fact cortical substance, which is'always much softer than enamel, and has indeed none of its peculiar properties. The cortical substance in the tooth of the walrus and in all other teeth contains calcareous cells and calcareous tubes, which, when viewed here in a transverse section, show themselves arranged in beautiful rings, one external to the other. In the canine teeth, the cortical substance forms only a thin layer of from ^ to V" in diameter ; but in many parts of the small molar tooth the diameter is 2"'. It surrounds the tooth on all sides, except at the masti- cating surface which has been worn away, where the dental bone itself is exposed. It is this thick cortical investment which gives to the molars of the walrus their peculiar clumsy appearance, and causes them to lose, as it w'ere, their normal shape. If such a tooth be split along its axis, that part which is formed by the pulp is found to be deeply bedded in the above-mentioned shajie- less cortical mass, which, as has been said, surrounds the root itself. The tooth whilst whole is thicker towards the crown than towards the root; but on its being sawn open, it is found that the dental bone, properly so called, is narrower towards the crown and thicker near the root. There is a well-defined boundary between the dental bone and the cortical substance, in the shape of a clear, yellowish streak : nevertheless, it is found by means of the microscope that the outer extremities of the tubes, or the outer cells in the dental bone, communicate with the internal cells of the cortical substance. These com- munications are particularly distinct in the root. Be- sides them, there were also found here tolerably large tubes, which run ujwvards into the substance in the centre of tlie tooth above described, and which contained a red matter, probably dried blood. These broader tubes are very similjir

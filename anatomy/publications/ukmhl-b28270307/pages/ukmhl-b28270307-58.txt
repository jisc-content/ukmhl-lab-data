HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 3G words are:—“ A quelques epoques qu’on les considere, on n’aper^oit aucune trace fibreuse, auciine maille cellu- leuse, qui aient de la parite avec le systeme osseux.” (p. 62.) On the eruption of the teeth he makes some very ex- cellent remarks ; but, together with all who have hitherto written on the subject, he holds that the capsule is absorbed, or detached from the crown, at the period of extrusion, but that it adheres to the neck, and forms by its external layer the periosteum of the socket, whilst its internal layer adheres to the fang of the tooth. With regard to the order of eruption, he is one of the first who pointed out a circumstance of considerable prac- tical importance, which is, that the first small grinder suc- ceeds next to the lateral incisor, and that the canine ap- pears afterwards, contrary to the generally received opi- nion that the canine succeeds the lateral incisor ; he gives a summary of reasons why the former must be the case. His views on the process of shedding, and on the va- rious theories extant on this subject, are concisely stated ; but it does not appear to me that his own hypothesis throws much new light on this process. His explanation resolves itself to the acknowledgment of a “ loi primor- diale, dont on ne pent donner aucune raison physique,” which destroys the partition between the alveoli of the two sets of teeth, and liberates the root of the first tooth, which becomes loose, and falls out on the slightest move- ment. He does not consider it as a necessary conse- quence that the fangs of the first set should be absorbed. He discusses at considerable length the order and pe- riod of appearance of the second set of teeth, and the contradictory accounts Avhich have been given of tliis phenomenon ; he has evidently studied the subject, and his own ideas on it are narrated with great perspicuity.

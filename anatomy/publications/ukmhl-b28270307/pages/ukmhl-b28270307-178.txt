156 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Meckel describes the “ root and neck to be covered by a thin membrane, and the alveolar cavity to be lined with a thick, fibrous membrane,” which is “ continuous with the gum.”* On this subject Mr. Bell expresses himself as follows :—“ The periosteum of the maxillary bones, after covering the alveolar process, dips down into each alveolar cavity, the parietes of which it lines. From the bottom of the cavity, where the vessels and nerves of the internal membrane enter, it appears to be reflected over the root of the tooth,which it entirely covers as far as the neck, at which part it becomes intimately connected with thegum.”'f' “ At this stage,” says Blandin, “ we can recognise perfectly the continuity of the capsule with the mucous membrane of the mouth.” “The capsule,” he adds, “ is formed of two layers,—an external one, of a fibrous nature, confounded with the proper periosteum of the alveolus; and an in- ternal one more vascular than the other, and adherent to the root of the tooth.Thus Blandin allows the exist- ence of not less than three distinct layers of membrane interposed between the root of the tooth and the bony socket. From these numerous discrepancies, to which I need add no more, it is evident that the above inquirers cannot all have pursued the simple method of investigation which M. Delabarre tells us he had determined to adopt:—“ Le scalpel, le burin, et la loupe en main,” says he, “ je 2H’o- menerai mes regards sur la nature comme etant le seul livre qui ne peut pas nous egarer.” In the want of a projoer “ loupe” is probably to be sought the origin of many of the above discrepancies.

136 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. from the other stellated parenchyma of the substance which we may here call the pulp of the enamel. “ This stratum of fibres is at first strictly connected with the pulp of the enamel, and seems to originate in the immediate transformation of the latter. Afterwards it separates itself from it more and more, and only ad- heres to it by some few filaments of cellular tissue. After it has freed itself in this manner, and become, as it were, indejiendent, it may justly be considered as a genuine membrane, and, on account of its function pre- sently to be noticed, we have already termed it the mem- brane of the enamel. The greatest part of it can then easily be separated from the circumjacent pulp of the ena- mel, only a thin stratum of the latter remaining adherent, except in the hollows of the molar teeth where the pa- renchyma of the enamel-pulp remains aggregated till the period of eruption; but neither then, nor at any preced- ing period, does it present any distinct traces either of vessels or nerves. “ When we examine more closely the membrane of the enamel, its internal surface is seen to consist of hex- angular, nearly uniform corpuscules, visible only through a magnifying glass, towards the centre of each of which is a round eminence. These corpuscules are nothing more than the ends of short fibres, of which the whole mem- brane is composed, and which, being pr'essed together, assume freely the hexangular form. These same hex- angular corpuscules are disposed in regular series,—from which arrangement it follows that they correspond exactly to the rows of enamel fibres formed from them. “ At the inferior extremity of the enamel-organ, the enamel-membrane is never so evidently separate from the parenchyma as in the other parts ; and it may lienee be

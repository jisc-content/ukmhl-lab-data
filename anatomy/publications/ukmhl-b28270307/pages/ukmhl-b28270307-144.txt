HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 122 that part of the tooth which is concealed in the alveo- lus. In most animals with simple teeth, as also in man, it only invests that part of the tooth which is not covered with enamel. In the hradypus, in which no enamel is found, it covers the whole tooth. “ Its deposition round the root of the tooth increases as the cavitas pulpse closes, and as the pulp itself correspond- ingly diminishes. The minute osseous tubes in the cor- tical substance then form immediate communications with the osseous cells and osseous tubes in the dental bone, so that the latter can now, when the pulp has as good as ceased to exist, receive the necessary supply of fluids from without. In certain animals the cortical sub- stance jiresents also larger canals, which are of about the same thickness as the medullary canals in bone. In the cortical substance closing in some teeth the end of the cavity of the pulp which would else be open, those tubes open into the said cavity, and contain the blood-vessels which belong to the pulp itself. The larger tubes which are found in that portion of the cortical substance lying ex- posed beyond the gum, appeared empty, and are proba- bly only the remains of the blood-vessels which were engaged in its formation. It is, however, still probable that even in this substance a circulation is kept up of peculiar fluids secreted from the blood, which fluids rise into the peculiar minute tubes and cells, in much the same manner as the sap rises in a plant. “ The layers of dental bone are deposited, as above de- scribed, from without inwards, the most external being thus always the first formed : in the cortical substance the reverse obtains,—its inner layers contiguous to the surface of the tooth are first formed, and afterwards the outer ones. “The cortical substance jirescnts no similarity to tartar;

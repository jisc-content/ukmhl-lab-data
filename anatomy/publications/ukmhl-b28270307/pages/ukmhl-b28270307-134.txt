112 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. jiressly, that some fish-teeth consist of fibrous substance with a coating of enamel, others of osseous substance with the same. In the former class, he places the teeth of the anarrhichas, in which the tubes have a considerable dia- meter, so that they may easily be seen when slightly magnified : in the latter class he numbers such teeth as have a harder and more comjiact dental bone, in which the tubes escaped his view. Both Cuvier and Von Born maintain that nerves and nutritive vessels enter the hol- low tubes. Retzius has found that the larger of these in the shark, pike, ling, and anarrhichas, often contain a red substance quite similar to the pulp, in the same way as do the larger tubes in the inner mass of the tooth of the walrus, (whence they may rightly be pronounced to be ramifying prolongations of the cavity of the pulp, analo- gous to the proper medullary canals in the substantia ossea,) and believes that the more minute tubes are alone pro- perly calcigerous. “ These inquiries into the Microscopical Structure of the Teeth,” says Retzius, in conclusion, “ have been made with the greatest care, and have cost me a great deal of trouble: they refute the observations and views of many of my predecessors ; but I nevertheless clearly see, that the results to which I have arrived can make no preten- sions to completeness. Whoever considers, for an in- stant, the variety of forms presented by the teeth of mammalia, amphibia, and fishes, as also their diversity corres]ponding to the diversity of the parts to which they are fixed, and, further, the different milk-teeth and per- manent teetli, must instantly see that a complete iuve.sfi-

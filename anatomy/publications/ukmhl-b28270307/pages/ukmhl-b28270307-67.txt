Tenon, in his excellent Trea- tise on the Changes of Form in the Teeth of Horses, (Mem. de ITnstitut National, des Sc. et des Arts, sec. Math, et Phys. pour I’An. 6, p. 568,) is the first who gives a good idea of it; he calls it cortical osseux. Cuvier (op. cit., p. 35) says, “ that the ‘ cortical’ is produced by the same lamina and the same face which has produced the enamel; which is proved by this lamina remaining externally to the ‘ cortical,’ as it was before external to the enamel, and that it is soft and loose so long as room is left it by the ‘ cortical.’ The nature of its tissue, how- ever, changes: so long as it only furnished enamel, it was thin and transparent; but in order to produce the ‘ cortical’ it becomes thick, spongy, opaque, and of a reddish colour.” In tracing the progress of knowledge in this depart- ment of science, we have now arrived at an era of novel and important investigation, highly honourable to the zealous inquirers who have commenced it, though more from the results it promises than from the practical facts which it has as yet established. Researches on the structure of the teeth by Pur- kinje’ have lately been given to the world in a dis- sertation by one of his pupils, (V. Fraenliel de yeni- tiori dentium humanorum structura ohservationes.) Pur- kinje found in the gum of the new-born child the small sacs discovered by Serres, and, in the fluid they con- tained, thin quintangular lamellae enclosing in their centre a round kernel, which he also found in the saliva and epithelium. He states that the substance of the tooth and the enamel have a near similarity to the structure of bone.

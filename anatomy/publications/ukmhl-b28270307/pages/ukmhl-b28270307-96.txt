74 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. open into the former after it has been fully formed, and that hence it is not altogether impossible that a formative action may go on in it after its first production. On the teeth of this animal there is no enamel. They are invested in their whole length with cortical substance. The cells nearest the dental bone are nearly round, and about tto line p. m. wide ; those lying more ex- ternally are generally oblong, si line p. m. long, and uso broad. The fine tubes which opened into them seemed to form large bundles running from them in an external direction. They were extremely delicate ; were not di- lated at their opening into the cells, on the external sides of which they were nearly parallel; and for each cell they were so numerous that Retzius could not count them with any degree of certainty. The cells themselves lie very close together. DasypusTricinctus.—In the small, cylindric, hollow teeth of the dasypus tricinctus, which are open towards the root, the main tubes were not more than half as thick as in the human subject: those occupying the internal part of the crown were more winding, more diverging, and less parallel than those at the sides ; the latter ran nearly straight, with a single faint curvature, of which the con- vexity was turned towards the crown and the axis of the tooth. The inner tubes of the crown did not display any ramification; but all had branches towards their outer extremities. In the teeth of the dasypus, Retzius only found one dental substance; neither enamel nor cortical substance were present. Dasypus Novemcinctus.—On the teeth of this animal no trace of cortical substance, or of enamel, could be found. Ovis aries.—In the incisor teeth, as well as in the thin folded plates of the osseous substance of the molar teeth

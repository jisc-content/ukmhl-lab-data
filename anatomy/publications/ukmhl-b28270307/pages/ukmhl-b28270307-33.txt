11 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. of the tooth is prolonged, notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, over the root, and that it only becomes weaker by degrees from the apex to the opposite extremity.” (P. 242.) He says that the cavity of the tooth is not entirely empty; but is filled, on the contrary, by a soft substance, produced by a lymphatic juice, which becomes thickened, though still without acquiring the consistence of bone. “ This,” he continues, “ is what I call the third substance of the tooth, differing from the kernel {le noyau) and the enamel,” &c. He affirms, moreover, that this substance forms sometimes a hard mass, which has scarcely any adherence with the other two, but which at length is consolidated with the ivory. In the “ Memoires de VAcademie des Sciences” there is a remarkable paper by Herissant on the formation of the enamel, and on the organisation of the gums. He admits that there are two species of gums, one temporary, the other permanent; the former being a tough tissue lining the whole extent of the alveolar arch, and closing up the alveoli; and thinks that when the tooth traverses it, it is exfoliated, as it were, and comes off in shreds. According to him, the sac that contains the dental follicle is a prolongation of the temporary gum; is the organ which secretes the enamel, and presents on its surface a great number of small vesicles filled with a fluid which, by a process of solidification, is converted into the latter. The views of Herissant are confirmed by Bourdet. Jour- DAiN, in his Essays on the formation of the teeth, has de- scribed minutely the dental follicle from its first appear- ance till the period of birth ; and he follows it in its suc- cessive evolutions. He describes also two canals in the lower jaw of the foetus—one, which is only a furrow des- tined for the passage of the vessels and nerves of the

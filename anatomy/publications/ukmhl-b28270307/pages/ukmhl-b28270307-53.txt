HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 31 He then proceeds to describe the dental membrane, as he calls it, or capsule, enclosing- the germs of the teeth, and in the interior of which these bones are developed. This he states to be composed of two plates or layers, “ one external and the other internal, distinct not only in their destination, but also in their structure and func- tions. The external layer, which is fibrous, is opaque and whitish ; on one side, it lines the interior of the alveo- lus, and serves as a periosteum; on the other, it is ap- plied to the external surface of the internal layer. Closely adhering at its inferior part to the dental nerves and vessels, it unites with the cartilage of the gums,'and when the tooth has protruded, it embraces its neck. It is endowed with a considerable degree of elasticity, and compresses the liquid in which the tooth is plunged : this appears,” he says, “ to be its use; for if a small opening is made in it, or if a small portion of it be removed, the internal layer, and the liquid which it contains, imme- diately protrude like a hernial sac through the opening, which proves that compression must be exercised by the external layer.” “ The internal layer is a very delicate transparent mem- brane sui generis. Bichat affirms that it is serous; but it is entirely vascular, and differs in this respect from that class of membranes : moreover, the fluid which it secretes is mucous as well as serous. It differs from mucous membranes, inasmuch as it has no follicules, and in its natural position may be regarded as a closed sac. I con- sider it as intermediate between these two orders of mem- branes. Externally it is covered, as we have stated, by the external layer, to which it adheres with considerable tenacity, particularly superiorly at the place where it corresponds to the fibro-cartilage of the gums.

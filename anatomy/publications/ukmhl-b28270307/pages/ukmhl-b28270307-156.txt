134 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. further carried out, of the usual granular formative mass, similar to that of all the other organs of the foetus; sub- sequently, however, by degrees it exhibits more clearly granulations of an angular form, which, connected toge- ther in various ways by filaments of cellular tissue, pre- sent the appearance of a kind of actinenchyma, such as may be seen in plants. “ This globular nucleus, which the capsular mem- brane surrounds, leaves a small interval between the latter, itself, and the dental germ, in which a peculiar fluid is found effused, which, when the capsular mem- brane is ruptured by continued pressure, flows freely out, and has the appearance of pure lymph, presenting no granules of any kind. This globular nucleus we have called by anticipation the organ of the enamel, because, from subsequent contemplation of the evolution of this organ, it will be rendered clear, that it is intended for the formation of the enamel substance, inasmuch as it is gra- dually transformed into the membrane which produces that substance. “ This takes place in the following manner.—The dental germ, in advancing further and further into the interior of the dental follicle, makes first only a slight impression on the globular mass of the enamel organ, but this impression is rendered gradually deeper as the growth of the germ proceeds. When the dental germ has penetrated further into the hollow thus made, it appears narrower towards the base, and thicker under the apex, and so is enclosed around on every side by the parenchyma of the enamel-organ, which thus assumes the appearance of a hood, covering the dental germ when advanced in its developement, and capable of being sepa- rated from it without difficulty, and without any injury.

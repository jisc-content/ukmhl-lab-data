HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 104 cells. The outer part of the dental hone forms, as it were, a peculiar layer, which is darker than the internal one ; precisely at the border between these two layers are situated a number of large calcareous cells. Besides these, other calcareous cells of different sizes are found through- out the dental bone. The cavity of the pulp in most of the teeth of the shark, which Betzius examined, though they were in different stages of develojDement, was very small. Towards the root some larger tubes opened into it, which contained a red matter, bearing some resem- blance to desiccated blood. These tubes ran longitudinally into the osseous basis on which the root is fastened, and terminated in its medullary canals. Esox Lucius.—In the common pike, as in most fishes, are found a number of unequally .developed teeth—from the smallest loose points, to the teeth immovably fixed to the jaw by a solid osseous base. On none of them could Ret- zius, by means of the microscope, perceive any covering of enamel: on the contrary, the dental bone was found to be so soft, that it could almost as easily be cut with a knife as a common quill. In the neighbourhood of the apex only, and on the sharp edges, did it feel somewhat harder at the surface. The bone by which the older teeth were fastened by their base to the maxilla, constitutes, though of a different appearance, a continuation of the inner or more recent dental bone itself, and wants the whiteness and lustre of the remaining tooth, inasmuch as it is tra- versed by large tubes even to the surface. The dental bone itself in the pike is properly divided, as it seems to Retzius, into an internal kernel provided with large tubes, and into an external thinner part, which latter forms the covering of the first, and contains minute and jiaiallel

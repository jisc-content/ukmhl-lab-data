14 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. on the connexion of the gum and tooth are not fully worked out: this subject, with that of the functions of the cellular texture of the periosteum, is very interesting. It is singular to observe the manner in which our great physiologist expresses himself on points which he did not settle by actual demonstration; as, for instance, on the nature of the enamel, and on the mode in which the teeth are shed. That he had no long and careful practice in the dis- eases of these organs is evident from some statements which would doubtless have been corrected, had he enjoyed better opportunities for observation. These state- ments have given rise to unwarrantable practice by super- ficial collators of information, whose respect for authority often leads them to follow it blindly without examination. I may instance here as prejudicially erroneous, his asser- tion that general affections of the system have less influ- ence on the teeth than on any other part. On the subject of the wearing down of the teeth, he also makes a few remarks, which have led to very pernicious practice. He calls the extraction of teeth “ a weakening cause,” and says that “ if by accident one tooth is lost, the rest will necessarily fail in some degree, even though they are sound, and likely to remain so, had not this accident hap- pened ; and this weakening cause is greater in proportion to the number that are lost. From this observation we see that the teeth support one another.” His practical remarks on the operations of stopping, extraction. See., will not be assented to by the well-in- formed practitioner of the present day ; yet they still fre- quently find a place in text-books, and are adopted by many as a guide in their daily practice. The art of trans- planting teeth, which he illustrated by some very curious experiments, has been since adopted with very injurious

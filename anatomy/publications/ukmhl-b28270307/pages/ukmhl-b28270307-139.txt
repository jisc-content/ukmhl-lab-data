117 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. between them consists, as I believe, in the manner of their formation. In dental bone the most external layer is first formed, in bone it is last formed, round each small medullary fibre. “ In bone every medullary fibre has the same size at its commencement which it afterwards retains. The small osseous cylinders, or layers, are formed by the veins, which lie externally round the medullary fibres, or out of the mass plentifully supplied with veins, in which the scattered, so called osseous fibres lie embedded. In order that the hollow fibrous structure in bones may be con- nected, the individual fibres and the small medullary canals enclosed within them form numerous communica- tions, which give to a bone, during the process of forma- tion, its well-known reticular appearance. Hence the medullary organ in the osseous fibres is not, in my opi- nion, like the juilpa dentis, the formative organ in bone ; but, on the other hand, it is probably of so much the greater importance for the preservation of the bone. The pulpa dentis, however, is the organ of formation as well as of preservation in the dental bone. In this diversity may probably have its origin the great difference be- tween bone and the tooth, that the substance of the former is subject to ‘ resorption’ and considerable change, which is not the case in the latter. The horns of deer remain for a considerable time without additional growth, and without ‘ resorption.’ It is well known that they are only shed in those animals in which the organs of jiro- pagation are uninjured ; in castrated deer the growth goes uniformly forwards. “ Many of the cylindrical bones are surrounded exter- ternally by concentric rings, which encircle the whole in the same manner as the regular, external, dental bone in

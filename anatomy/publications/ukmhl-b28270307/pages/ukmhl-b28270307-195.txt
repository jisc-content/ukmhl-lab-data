3 SERIES C. Fig. \,a a, are seen tlie ossified centres of the compart- ments : h h, the ivory. Fig. 3 is a portion of the transverse section given in Fig. 2, and taken from the situation marked c in the latter. Fig. 4 is meant merely to show the general appearance of the tooth. Plate C, 3, Fig. 1.—A vertical section of the tooth of the Walrus, as viewed by means of a magnifying power of one inch focal distance. This tooth consists of crusta petrosa a, ivory h, and ossified pulp c, intermingled with irregularly formed ivory. Plate C. 3, Fig. 2.—A section of a tusk of the Elephant, as viewed by means of a magnifying power of one inch focal distance, where disease has greatly affected the formation of the structure of the ivory, and produced an appearance, as seen at c, similar to that which is normally found in the walrus. It is curious to remark that the commencement d of this irregular portion is defined by a layer con- taining corpuscules, such as are seen in the crusta pe- trosa; a is the crusta petrosa, h the ivory. Plate C. 4, contains various sections of different por- tions of the crusta petrosa of the elephant’s grinder, as seen by means of a magnifying power of one inch focal distance, displaying the organisation of that structure, the resemblance of which to true bone is very evident. The two first sections. Figs. 1 and 2, are from the portions of crusta petrosa, which fill up the lateral convolutions of the tooth. Figure 3 shows the beautifid arrangement of the other portions of the tooth in connexion with the crusta petrosa; a the crusta petrosa, h h the ivory, and c c the enamel. Fig. 4, a highly magnified portion of the vertical section, showing the disposition and a2)pearance of the corpuscules.

25 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. are vascular. He Iiolcls that the capsule or membranes de- rive vessels from the gums, hut the pulp from the jaw. This is contrary to the opinions of Hunter and Blake, who again differ from each other, inasmuch as the former con- siders that the inner layer only is vascular, whilst the latter maintains that vessels are found in the outer layer alone. He mentions, (p. 23,) that in a young elephant dissected by Sir A. Cooper, “ the adhesion of the pulp to the cham- ber around was strong, and required a considerable de- gree of force to separate.” Cuvier expressly denies that any such intimacy of union exists in this case. According to Fox, the enamel is fibrous, and the ivory stratified ; he considers the periosteum of the fang common to both it and the alveolar process, and states (p. 2, Pt. ii.) that it is a reflection on the fang, being firmly attached to the gum at the neck of the tooth. This writer again differs from Hunter in considering the teeth from their vascularity as similar to hone, and as only differing from it inasmuch as they are denser, and their exposed surface is covered with enamel. They are moreover subject, he says, to the same diseases as hone, but cannot exfoliate like the latter. In enumerating their diseases, he uses the same nomenclature as for those of bones. According to him, it is a process of absorption which opens a passage for the extrusion of the teeth, this ab- sorption taking place first in the membranes, and then in the gum. Fox is at issue with Hunter on the subject of the origin of decay ; the former expressing himself surprised that the latter should not have arrived at its true cause, which, according to him, is inflammation terminating in morti- fication. He considers that disease originally attacks the

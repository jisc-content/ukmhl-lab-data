On some of the larger cells Retzius counted from eight to ten larger tubes, which were given off from them, or opened into them. In the teeth, of which the roots were pointed, the cells were so predominant that scarcely any regular tubes were found ; hut nevertheless a definite border was observable between the dental bone thus constituted and the cortical substance, in which the cells lay in nearly regular rows. The external cells in the dental hone formed, however, connexions with the cells in the cortical substance. The teeth of the dolphin, like those of the walrus and seal, appear to he closed at an early period, and to be deprived, as it were, of their pulp, which peculiarity may perhaps have its origin in the circumstance that the teeth of this animal have generally only to work on soft substances, are hence less exposed to he worn away, and so have less occasion for additional growth than those of most of the land mammalia. On the other hand, they appear to be provided better than other teeth with a strong covering of cortical substance, secreted by the internal membrane of the alveolus, which is doubtless a residue of the dental sac. If we suppose that the tooth must keep up a continual communication with the rest of the organism, it is probable that when this ceases to be kept up by means of the pulp, from the disappearance of the latter, it is effected through the cortical substance, and the tubes which pass from it into the cells of the dental hone: moreover, such an alteration may in some measure promote the extrusion of the tooth from the alveolus after the cavity of the pulp has closed.

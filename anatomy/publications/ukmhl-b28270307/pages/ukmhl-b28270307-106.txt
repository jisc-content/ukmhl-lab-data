HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 84 diminished as they approached the external parietes, and formed furcated divisions at very acute angdes, thus filling the larger space which they had to occupy the further they were removed from the axis of the tooth. Besides these grand divisions, they gave off smaller branches following close on each other, of which Betzius could not trace the course, because they filled so rapidly with the fluid in which the preparation was immersed, that they became as clear as the spaces between them. Besides these short tubes which fill up, in a great measure, the intermediate spaces, the latter were occupied, more than in any teeth which have previously been described, by small, white, angular points, or calcareous cells of dif- ferent sizes, Avhich lay streivn about like grains of white sand. Then again, as well as these scattered and less thick-set calcareous cells, there were also other larger ones, more crowded and connected together, which lay in the above-mentioned parallel curvatures. In trans- verse sections of the canine teeth of the elephant, they form beautiful, regular rings round the cavity of the pulp, or the axis of the tooth, of which some stand about ^ p. M. from each other, and which are so minute that they could not he seen with the naked eye. In longitu- dinal sections they form whiter, longitudinal, parallel streaks. These streaks and rings are not, however, those which Cuvier and others have described, for the latter are visible to the naked eye, and they shew themselves as broad, darker or lighter concentric osseous layers; they are also not to be confounded with the streaks in ivory, which ap- pear in a transverse section running in arches from the centre to the periphery, which cross each othei, and in longitudinal sections ajipear as unequal, but geneially parallel stripes, which here and there are cut into rhomboid

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 107 alone, when those are not worn away, a coating of enamel. This latter is here placed like the iron projection {jernsTio- ningeti) on some wooden spades, runs before and behind as into a transverse edge, and in some into a short lancet- formed point: it gives to the apex of the tooth its white appearance, and is found, it seems, on all teeth from their commencement. The fixed teeth also have a cavity of the pulp, which in some is larger, in others smaller, and which unites with a corresponding excavation in the osseous base on which the tooth is fixed.. In some teeth the cavity of the pulp is very small, be- ing nearly reduced to a conical tube running in the di- rection of the axis of the tooth. In the dental bone itself of the ling there was a great paucity of tubes. Along the wall of the cavity of the pulp, which ran longitudinally, and was in part tubiform? the main tubes opened with short trunks of from -k to to" p.M. in thickness, which ran towards the apex, and in an outward direction, (rami patentes, Botanic;) and gave off* branches on both sides, between which there were con- siderable intervals: these branches formed, with others of the contiguous tubes, large loop-formed anastomoses, and their outer extremities entered also into closed anasto- moses, almost like the more minute blood-vessels in the villi of the abdominal canal. This most external arrangement of anastomoses forms here, as in the pike, a sort of boun- dary, beyond which no larger tubes are found. The more minute lateral branches of the tubes of the dental bone in the ling were not easily discovered ; they appeared to be less regular, and generally ran in a direc- tion transverse to the tubes from which they rose, or pa- rallel to the axis of the tooth.

103 HISTORICAL INTROHUCTIO>r. In the other fish-teeth which Retzius examined, he found no other substance which could be considered as ana- logous to the cortical covering, except the proper osseous substance, which united the tooth with the jaw. In the Shark, whose teeth are bound to the jaw by ligaments, this substance formed a rounded basilary part on the free extremity, the organization of which part is scarcely to be distinguished from that of the more perfect structure of real bone. Squalus cornuhicus.—In the lamna most of the teeth, though flat, were still somewhat hollow, and were provided with a thick coating of enamel. The largest diameter of the tubes of the dental bone is sro/' p. m. At the top of the tooth they run in an upward direction; on the sides, transversely towards the external surface ; and nearer the root, (which is fastened on a basis of real bone), they radiate in a downward direction. The proper trunks of the tubes lie at a tolerable distance from each other, and their divisions, which in many cases commence very near to the origin of the main tubes from the internal wall which is turned towards the cavity of the pulp, recede considerably from each other—(Plate A. 2. Fig. 3); whilst their diameter diminishes more rapidly than in more perfect teeth of the same size. In the entire course of the divisions, as well as of the trunks, numerous mi- nuter lateral branches are given off in a direction which is exactly transverse to that of the tubes from which they rise. In the neighbourhood of the external surface, these minuter branches become completely parallel, and termi- nate under the enamel in large, irregular calcareous cells. These calcareous cells give off’ other irregular tubes, which partly unite with each other, and partly terminate in other

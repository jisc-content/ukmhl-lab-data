81 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. origin to any accuniiilated cells. The calcareous cells were largâ€™er than in the permanent teeth. In the permanent molar teeth of the full-grown horse, the main tubes in the dental substance were not so close as in the incisor teeth, and maintained exactly the same diameter till very near the enamel, which here, singularly enough, invests the whole extent of the dental hone as far as the ends of the roots. The branches were thicker on leaving the trunks, and did not run so close to these as in the incisor teeth. The undulations were better marked, though drawn out and irregular. Most of the main tubes were considerably extended towards the crown, assuming the form of an inverted/, with a considerable prolongation of the lower extremity. The outer or coronal extremity of the main tubes was curved away from the axis of the tooth in an almost transverse direction. In this transverse part several of the tubes seemed near their termination to make one or two larger curvatures. In the neighbour' hood of the root, most of the tubes assumed a more trans- verse position, as in most other teeth. The greatest part of the cavities of these teeth was closed, in the neighbour- hood of the masticating surface, by dental bone, and the cavity of the pulp was very narrow as far as the com- mencement of the root. It was filled with a more yellowish, brown, osseous substance, which nearer the masticating surface was dark brown, probably from colouring mat- ter which had penetrated from the food without. As the tubes in this more recent dental structure ran almost di- rectly towards the masticating surface, where their ends were worn away by attrition, and were denuded of all covering, it is easily conceivable, that during mastication, colouring matters of different kinds penetrate this sul>- stance more easily than any other.

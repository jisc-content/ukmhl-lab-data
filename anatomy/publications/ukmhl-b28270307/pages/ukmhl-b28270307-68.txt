HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 4G but on the outer surface of the root, lie says, that there is a layer of true osseous substance, in which, at any rate, may be seen the osseous corpuscula which he has disco- vered.* This same structure he has discovered in the cement of the teeth of several animals. The proper dental substance examined in thin polished lamellae consists of a uniform structureless (structurlos) substance, and of fibres passing through it. These latter run in parallel lines from the outer to the inner surface of the tooth, obliquely in some places, straight in others : they are in every part nearly of the same size, and communicate by but few branches Avith each other. Though they are very thickly placed, still the structureless intermediate substance forms the greater part of the mass of the tooth : as their diameter he gives one-fifth or one-sixth of the space between two of them. He has also discovered that these fibres are tubu- lar, and that in the teeth of the horse, at any rate, they are capable of absorbing ink by capillary attractionâ€”a fact Avhich is also confirmed by Muller. As to what these tubuli may contain in their normal state, Purkinje is silent; but Muller has instituted researches which go to prove that parts of them, at any rate, are filled Avith inor- ganic, calcareous salts. The latter goes on to say, that when the light falls on fine polished lamellae of dental bone, the white colour of the tooth is soon seen to be oAving to these tubes or fibres, and that the intermediate substance is more transparent; moreover, that when such sections are submitted to the action of an acid, the white colour of the fibres disappears, the remaining cartilage still presenting tubes in their interior, Avhich, however, when dried, are. no longer white. He saw in healthy as well as in carious * Muller states that he has had frequent opportunities of confirming these results.

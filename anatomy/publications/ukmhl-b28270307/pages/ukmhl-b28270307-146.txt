124 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, especially Arnold, Raschkow, and Goodsir. The first and last of these gentlemen have devoted their attention ex- clusively to the early, or, as it is called, follicular stage in the developement of these organs. They consider that the process of dentition ought to be divided into three separate stages or snbprocesses, and that this division is not arbitrary, but well marked and defined by obvious transitions in the progress of developement from the embryonic to the adult state—these transitions moreover being indicated by phenomena attendant on the position of the pulp in relation to the cavity in which it is con- tained. The first of these stages Mr. Goodsir deno- minates the follicular—the second, the saccular—the third, the eruptive. He further thinks that there may be said to be another stage, anterior to all these, the papillary— designating that state of the pulp when it is a mere pa- pilla on the free surface of the mucous membrane; but he finally prefers to include this in the follicular stage, on account of its very brief duration. Mr. Goodsir commences his paper* by an excellent ac- count of the appearances presented on the dissection of fifteen human embryos, at different periods of de- velopement after the sixth week. He found at the fourth month bodies which he describes as gelatinous and gra- nular, situated between the pulp and the sac—the same bodies which a few years previously had forcibly attracted the attention of Purkinje and Raschkow, as we shall presently relate. On the extrusion of the tooth Goodsir speaks as fol- lo^vs;—“ At the moment, however, that the tooth passes through the gum, (Avhen the non-adherent portion of the sac resumes its primitive follicular condition, its inner In the Edinburgh Med. and Sur.

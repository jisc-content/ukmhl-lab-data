In the adult subject, Serres maintains that their function is changed to that of secreting the tartar ; and he follows up this opinion by observations on that substance, which it is not necessary here to discuss. We must also pass over in silence his ideas on the physiology of the facial a ngle at the different periods of life. The second part of his work is devoted to the physio- logy of the teeth ; and he commences it by the general assertion that these organs belong to the osseous system, Imt are still of a different “ tissue.” They are composed, he says, of three different substances ; viz. enamel which covers the crown, a bony part which constitutes the base, and a soft part which fills up the internal cavity, “ dont la nature ne nous est pas encore Men connue.” The ]iosition and texture of the enamel are well described. He considers that it does not acquire its hardness and polish till it is exposed to the air; and he combats the opinions of Herissant and Cuvier on this subject. He has never been able to see the follicles of Herissant. This substance has never appeared to him to be fibrous; and he asks why its functions are interrupted when it reaches the fang.

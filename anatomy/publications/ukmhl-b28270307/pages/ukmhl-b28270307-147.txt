HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 125 membrane becoming continuous with the mucous mem- brane of the mouth,) the non-adherent portion of the sac shortens more rapidly than the fang lengthens, in con- sequence of which the adherent portion with the fang itself separates from the fundus of the alveolus, and the body of the tooth advances through the gum.” (p. 27.) He at the same time considers it to be a law in the de- velopement of animal bodies, “ that parts or organs which have once acted an important part, however atro- phied they may afterwards become, yet never altogether disappear so long as they do not interfere with other parts or functions.” (p. 28.) “ The first or follicular stage,” he says, “ comprehends all the phenomena which present themselves from the first appearance of the dental groove and papillae, till the latter become completely hid by the closure of the mouths of their follicles, and of the groove itself. It is upon this hitherto unknown stage of dentition that I have insisted so much in the former sections of this paper. “ The second or saccular stage is the one with which anatomists have been so long familiar, during which the papillte are pulps, and the open follicles which contain them are shut sacs, when the tooth-substance and the enamel, constituting the teeth themselves, are deposited. It is during this stage also that some of the most interest- ing phenomena in the formation of the alveolar processes present themselves. “ The third or eruptive stage includes the completion of the teeth, the eruption and shedding of the temporary set, the eruption of the permanent, and the necessary changes in the alveolar processes. “ When viewed in reference to an individual tooth.

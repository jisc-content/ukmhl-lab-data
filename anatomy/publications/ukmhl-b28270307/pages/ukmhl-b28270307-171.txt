149 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. function, and whether it is not probable that the enamel- fibres do not continually derive fresh materials of increase from this quarter. “ The developement of the gum is connected in the most intimate manner with the history of that of the teeth, the maxillary hones, and the alveoli. In treating of the de- velopement of the teeth, we were unwillingly compelled to devote some attention to observations respecting the developement of these parts. Thus, for example, we are struck with the great firmness of the inferior maxillary hone at an early period, compared with that of other hones of the foetus, and also with the comparative perfection of its nerves and vessels. “ With respect to the gum, the dental cartilage, as it is called, in man and other mammalia, is chiefly worthy of mention. It is not true cartilage, for the peculiar gra- nules which principally characterise that substance are wanting in its parenchyma, which, however, is otherwise firm. In the first place, there is found in this dental car- tilage • a tolerably thick stratum of the epithelium of the mucous membrane, which corresponds to the epidermis of the external skin, and like it, but in a much more per- fect manner, consists of various polyedric scales placed one above the other, several of which present an orbicular spot in their centre. Under this epithelium is situated the hard parenchyma of the dental cartilage, which, in my opinion, corresponds to the chorion of the skin, inasmuch as it is granular, abundantly supplied with vessels, and in- terwoven with numerous firm and fibrous filaments. In this tissue, in the new-born infant, closed cavities are con- stantly found dispersed here and there, which are filled with scales similar to those of which the epithelium is com- posed. These, without any doubt, are those glands which

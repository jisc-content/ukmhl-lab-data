HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 140 no evident network, of vessels is yet perceived. This fact offers a certain analogy to what takes place in osseous substance, where also networks of sanguiferous vessels are not rendered evident till the proper earthy substance of the bones is found deposited. “ The prseformative membrane belongs so peculiarly to the dental germ, that it uniformly exists from its first commencement, so that by its presence, should there be any doubt, the dental germ may be distinguished from every other organ; for example, from the capsular mem- brane, or the enamel-organ. With respect to its consist- ence, (if I may use the expression,) it displays a remark- able tenacity, for under the compressor, even when con- tinued pressure is exercised, it is only ruptured with dif- ficulty, and before being ruptured it not unfrequently swells into a considerable vesicle. Immediately under this membrane are found granules of the parenchyma of the dental germ, more regularly arranged, and more lon- gitudinally extended, placed uniformly on the membrane, partly at right angles, and partly at somewhat acute angles. “ When the developement of the dental germ has made considerable progress, and the time for the formation of the dental substance approaches, a number of elevations {tumulorum instar) are found in the prseformative mem- brane, at the apex and its vicinity, which are probably af- ■ terwards transformed into the undulating ridges of the extreme surface of the dental substance, in which the enamel fibres are firmly placed. At this period also, im- mediately under tlie membrane, the proper dental sub- stance is formed, the process commencing always at the coronal apex, and thence uniformly advancing on the one

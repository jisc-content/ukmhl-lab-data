155 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. and structure of this latter substance will be given in an early chapter of the present work. The minute and interesting bodies first noticed by Clo- quet and Serres, and denominated by them the dental glands, have been denied, to exist by some inquirers, and one writer has gone so far as to assert that they are “ too manifestly a mistake to require any particular refutation.” They certainly, however, do exist, though probably they are neither entitled to the appellation of glands, nor endowed with the permanent functions assigned to them by Serres and Blandin—and in my opi- nion they merit very attentive consideration. A knowledge of what may be called the periosteal func- tions of the capsule, in connexion with those of the true periosteum of the socket, is also of great practical import- ance ; for many sound teeth are lost from suppuration of the membranes connected with their sockets and roots : but on this subject, also, the opinions of writers on the teeth are contradictory in the extreme. Monro maintains that the teeth have no periosteum of their own, “ but that it is supplied by the reflected membrane of the gums.”* Hunter considers that the periosteum of the alveolus “ is common to the tooth and socket.”f Blake says, that “ the external periosteum of the jaw seems lost in the gumbut that the teeth are “ attached to the alveo- lar cavity by a strong periosteum.’’^: Fox considers that the periosteum “ is reflected from the alveolar process on the root of the tooth.”§ Delabarre considers that the socket and the root of the tooth have each a periosteum of their own ; but that both are very intimately connected. * Monro on the Bones, p. 114. t Hunter’s Natur.al History of the Teeth, p. 43. j: Blake, p. 169 and 33. § Fox, p. 11.

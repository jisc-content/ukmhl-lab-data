HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 2 of Hippocrates, we know but little, except that they are embodied in the works of the latter. Homer calls the teeth “ little barriers opposed by nature to the unruliness of the tongue, and to the abuse of speech.” He is fond of designating them as forming a wall or fence (epKoc oSoprcoy.) The views of Hippocrates, avIio lived between three and four hundred years b. c., respecting their origin and formation, are extremely crude and fantastic. He says, “ There is a glutinous increment from the bones of the head and jaws, of which the fatty part is dried by heat and burnt up, and the teeth are made harder than the other bones, because there is nothing cold in them.” He goes on to say, that in the foetus they are nourished by the food of the mother, and after birth by the milk which the infant sucks from the breast. He calls the wise teeth tTw^poviffTrjpec, and holds an opinion, which several authors have maintained after him, that to have a great number of teeth is a sign of longevity. Aristotle was so ignorant of the anatomy of these parts, as to assert that man has more teeth than woman, and that this difference is observable between the sexes in various classes of animals, as for instance in sheep, goats, pigs. All viviparous red-blooded animals have, he says, teeth ; but all have them not in both jaws. Animals with horns, he continues, have no teeth in the front of the upper jaw, and in some without horns this peculiarity is observed, for example in the camel. He states that only the front teeth change in man; that the molars are not shed in any known animal; that the pig loses no tooth ; that the age of animals may be determined by their teeth ; and that they become discoloured in course of time.

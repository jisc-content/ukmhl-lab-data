59 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, * Pliitc A. 1, Fig, 4. tooth more perpendicular. In some parts of several teeth they are curved in various ways. They are somewhat larger at the outer than at the inner extremities, but in a degree which is not perceptible without the aid of the micrometer. In the crown of the human molar tooth, a number of fibres are wedged into the outer part of the enamel, but do not penetrate to the surface of the dental bone, Retzius has also seen a similar arrangement in other teeth, as for instance in the long, straight sides of the molars of the horse, and of the ruminating animals. In some of the mammalia the enamel-fibres are extremely indistinct, Retzius could seldom find them in amphi- bious animals and fishes ; but where they presented them- selves distinctly, they were but slightly dissimilar to those in the human tooth, A glass which magnifies three hundred times is neces- sary in order that the enamel-fibres may be distinctly observed: they are then seen ranged, side by side, like the wax tubes in the honeycomb, and like these they are hexagonal,*' If the enamel of a well-formed human tooth, which has not been worn away by attrition, be examined under a good glass, a number of elevated, undulating lines are observed on it running parallel from side to side, which are so delicate and so close together, that Retzius says he counted not less than twenty-four of them on an incisor, in the space of a Parisian line. They are most beauti- ful and closest together on the outside of the incisor, canine, and single molar teeth; and are less distinct and more apart in the tricuspides. They do not run merely on the outer side of all these teeth, but are con-

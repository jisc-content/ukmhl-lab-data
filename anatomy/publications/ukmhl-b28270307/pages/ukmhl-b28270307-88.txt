66 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tlie sides and between the roots the cells were the same as in the canine tooth ; but round the ends of the short roots they were in the highest degree irregular. Several were two or three times larger than those just mentioned ; they ran into each other, and intruded as it were into the re- gion of the dental bone. Here also were found similar but larger canals, running to the end of the cavitaspulpce: these canals contain probably the blood-vessels, which furnish nourishment to the pulp. Canis familiaris.—The teeth of the dog were found to be like those of the lynx. In the roots of the incisor teeth the tubes were very angularly curved, curled as it were, and splitting into lengthy branches. Erinaceus Europcsus.—In the hedge-hog the main tubes are of the same thickness as in the preceding, but shorter in consequence of the smallness of the teeth. In the in- cisor teeth they are, as it were, drawn out, and faintly un- dulating, with only a few larger curvatures ; on the other hand, the branches here are extremely evident; they curve very beautifully in almost all directions, more par- ticularly towards the crown and the root; but in the crown itself the curves are generally turned towards the surface. The branches are probably so particularly evi- dent in these teeth, because they continue thicker for a longer distance than in different other teeth. Whoever wishes to convince himself of the ramifica- tion of the tubes in dental bone, cannot better or more easily do so than by examining a thinly-filed longitudinal .slice of the incisor tooth of a hedgehog. In the crowns of the molar teeth, the main tubes are straighter, in the roots curled and undulating ; the particularly short trunks terminate immediately after their commencement in long, thick branches, running towards the surface of

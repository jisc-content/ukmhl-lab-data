87 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. these the tubular structure was admirably demonstrated. He found the main tubes at their widest end p.m. broad. Althoug'h they were somewhat unequal, and showed here and there an extremely faint curve, they still could not be regarded as undulating. Like the main tubes in the alveolar ends of most teeth, they had an almost hori- zontal direction from the cavity of the pulp to the peri- phery of the root. As they proceeded in their course to- wards the periphery, their furcated divisions were very apparent, and they gave off moreover a great abundance of branches, of which many appeared distinctly to terminate in large calcareous cells. These lay thinly scattered in the interstices between the main tubes, which interstices, bordering on the cavity of the pulp, were of about the width of two tubes. A thick and compact layer of larger and smaller calcareous cells had its seat at the outer surface of the root, immediately under the cortical sub- stance which invested it. Between these closely-situated, communicating cells, the extreme ends of the tubes wound in particular abundance, and seemed partly to terminate in these calcareous cells themselves, and partly to anasto- mose with branches from contiguous tubes. These anas- tomoses appeared in many places to form beautiful arches. In one or two places were larger groups of calcareous cells in the midst of the dental bone, which had, as it were, supplanted the main tubes. Round these cellular groups wound a number of beautifully-arched branches from the most contiguous main tubes, which themselves inclined somewhat towards them : these branches ran also straight to the cells, and terminated in them. Besides the brancheswhicharevisible in great abundance, Retzius could see from thick-set, nearly alternately situated unevennesses on botii sides of the main tubes, that these

47 IIISTOniCAL INTRODUCTION. teeth, that in parts of these tubes something was con- tained. Linderer, who has long been engaged in re- searches on healthy and decayed teeth, has observed, that the dental substance in the latter (even where the enamel only is aflected) loses its colour in several parts between the carious spot and the internal cavity. As this is nearly always the case, it is evident that an alteration in the sub- stance of the tooth must be produced by the superficial caries. In fine polished sections of such teeth, Muller could easily see with the microscope, that where they were become transparent, a crumbly substance was contained in parts of the tubuli, and that this substance was more coherent in the tubuli of the white tracts; by adding diluted acid, he also observed under the microscope that this crumbly substance was dissolved. He has often per- formed this experiment with the same result on fine po- lished slices of healthy teeth. In these he found indivi- dual fibres, frequently in considerable number, on which were dark spots following close on each other. Inasmuch as the dental fibres have their white colour destroyed by acids, whilst the intermediate substance re- mains transparent, it follows that either the parietes of the tubes, or their interior, must contain calcareous salts. In breaking fine sections of teeth perpendicularly to the fibres, Muller has frequently seen the latter projecting a little at the fractured edge. In such cases they are quite straight and not curved, and seem to be not at all flexible. Hence it follows that the tubes have an organised basis, a membrane, and that this in the solid tooth is stiff and brittle, and probably saturated with calcareous salts, but weak and soft in the tooth which has been deprived of the latter. The calcareous salts of the tooth exist not merely in the

4 IIISTOBICAL INTRODUCTION. Aetius says that the teeth are open at the roots, where they admit small nerves coming from the trifacial; and that it is for this reason that they are the only hones which can become painful of themselves. He adds, that they grow till old age by the deposition in their interior of a nervous fluid ; but that at that period the process of. nutrition ceases, and they become loose, and finally drop out Rhazes described the process of dentition, but in a very in- complete manner. Abulcasis was the first who distinctly taught that teeth may be replaced either by other human teeth, or by artificial ones, made out of the bones of an ox. Vesalius, the restorer of human anatomy, who was born about 1512, does not appear to have studied the teeth with the same attention which he devoted to the other parts of the body. According to him, the milk-teeth are the germs of the permanent teeth. The knowledge of these organs was greatly advanced by Eustachius, whose description of their number, different forms and varieties, leaves nothing to be desired: he compares their adhesion to the gums to that of the nails to the skin; {sicut cutis extremcB unguium parti adhcerescit ita gingivce dentibus adjunctcB sunt;) and thinks with the ancients that their degree of hardness is proportioned to the ferocity of the animal. He made careful inquiries into their structure, in which he recog- nises two constituent parts, and compares the enamel to the bark of trees {duplici substantia veluti arbores tegun- tur). In an article on their developement, he describes the follicles, their vessels and nerves; refutes the opinion of those who think that the roots of the milk-teeth are employed towards the formation of the permanent ones, and says that if the germs of the latter are not seen in the foetus, it is not that they do not exist, but that they are

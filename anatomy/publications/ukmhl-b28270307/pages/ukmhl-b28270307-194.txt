2 EXPLANATION OF PLATES, Tliis texture is generally worn away by attrition from the top of the tooth, as is seen in the specimen. Plate C. 1, Fig. 4, 5, and 6.—Three sections of the tooth of the Orycteropus Capensis. Fig. 4 is a trans- verse, and Fig. 6 is a vertical section, both as viewed by means of a magnifying power of half-inch focal distance ; and Fig. 5 is a highly magnified portion of the transverse section, as seen under a magnifying poAver of one-tenth of an inch focal distance. The structure of this tooth shows the difficulty of classifying the objects of natural history. It has generally been classed among the teeth of the simplest structure, whereas, when rightly considered, it is a very curious and interesting example of a com- plicated structure. Processes of the pulp in an ossified state are present in the centre of each lozenge-shajied compartment, as seen in the transverse section. Fig. 6,a « a, and may be observed more particularly in the centre of the highly-magnified portion of the same. Fig. 5, a. The external surface of the whole tooth is enveloj^ed in a com- paratively thick investment of crusta petrosa, as seen at a a. Fig. 4. h h. Fig. 4, is the ivory portion of the tooth. h h. Fig. 6, and h b, Fig. 5, mark the jieripheral portion of the compartments where corpuscules are seen as in the crusta petrosa. Plate C. 2 contains sections of the tooth of the Ptychodus Polygyrus. Figs. 1 and 2 are vieAved by means of a magnifying power of half an inch focal distance, and Fig. 3 by means of one-tenth of an inch focal distance. The structure of this fossil-tooth is somewhat similar to that of the Orycteropus, but not so regular. At a a, Fig. 2, are seen the small compartments in the centre of Avhich is the ossified pulp. Fig. 2 c marks tlie situation of tlie small })ortion which is highly magnified at Fig. 3. At

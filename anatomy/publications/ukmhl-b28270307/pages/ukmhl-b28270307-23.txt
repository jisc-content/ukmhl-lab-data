HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. It is at all times instructive and of great utility to trace the progress of any branch of science, and as much im- portance is always justly attached to priority of informa- tion, as marking industry and activity of research, it behoves us, in the first place, to give a condensed view of the progress of knowledge respecting the teeth. This will enable us to judge what departments have hitherto been principally defective, and have remained to be eluci- dated by present or future researches.* We learn from Herodotus that amongst the Egyptians at a very remote period, the care of the teeth was assigned to a particular class of persons ; but respecting their ana- tomical knowledge, or proficiency in their art, we have no information. Of the views entertained of the physiology and pathology of these organs in Greece before the time • In compiling the following Historical Sketch, I have consulted the works of original writers on the subject, and have derived much general assistance from Blandin’s excellent work on the teeth, and from the late remarkable publication of Professor Retzius of Stockholm, whose ingenuousness in acknowledging the ^ merits of preceding inquirers cannot be too much applauded. In collating the different accounts which have appeared of his Researches with the original Swedish work of Retzius, entitled “ Mikroskopiska Undersbkningar bfver , Tiindemes sHrdeles Tandbenets, struktur: Stockholm, 1837,” I have ^ received valuable assistance from my learned friends. Dr. Minton and Dr. Bialloblotzky. B

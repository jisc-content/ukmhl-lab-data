HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 29 but that it does not resemble bone either in its tissue, or in its manner of deposition and increase. “ Son tissu, he adds, “ noffre ni cellulosite, ni fibres, mats seulement des lames emhoitees les unes dans les autres.” He gives at length his reasons for believing that it is entirely non- vascular. In speaking of the capsule, he remarks, “ II ne produit point d'email ni de cortical sur les racines, parceque la lame interne de la capsule, qui a seule le pouvoir de secreter ces deux substances, ne setend pas jusque-la!' (P. 43.) The recent researches of the German school decidedly prove this observation to be incorrect. In treating of the tusks of the elephant, he states from actual observation, that there is no connexion whatever between the pulp and the ivory, and under this head he cites the appearance presented by the decomposition of fossil teeth as corroborative of his opinion regarding the concentric layers of growth. His remarks on the diseases of the teeth are generally fraught with sound sense and practical information. In 1817, M. Serres published a most interesting little work on the Anatomy and Physiology of the Teeth, in which he treats particularly of their organisation at an early stage. He says,* “ The rudiments of the head, and of all the organs which it contains, exist almost as soon as the embryo begins to be distinct in the product of conception ; the teeth, which are destined to perform the first func- tion in the circle of life, are formed and developed in the interior of the maxillary bones.

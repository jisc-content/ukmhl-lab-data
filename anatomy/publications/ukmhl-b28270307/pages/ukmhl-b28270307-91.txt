69 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. jiart of the tooth which was enclosed in the alveolus was completely covered with enamel. In the incisor teeth of the beaver, as also in those of the hare, the cortical sub- stance was wanting'. In the heaver and hare, and probably in all the ro- dentia, the teeth are invested with enamel in their entire extent. It is well known that these teeth, particularly the incisors, continue to grow during the whole life of the animal without closing at the alveolar extremity; so that one of them which has not been worn away, owing to its having grown in a wu’ong direction, becomes much longer than it was when it first projected from the alveo- lus. The enamel in these animals continues to be formed as long as the teeth continue to grow ; {Oudet, Experiences sur raccroissement continu et la reproduction des dents cliez les lapins, 2. mem.,) whence we may come to the certain conclusion, that it is not formed alone within the proper folliculus dentis, but that an organ for its production may continue to exist at the bottom of the alveolus itself dur- ing the whole life of the animal. The attention of Retzius was first called to this fact on his examining a longitu- dinal section of the third molar tooth (three inches and a half long, p. M.) out of the lower jaw of an old horse :—he found that even here the coating of enamel jiroceeded to terminate at the extreme border of the roots ; two roots of four lines in length, but open at the end, were already formed ; but even these were covered, as above described, witli enamel. In order to ascertain more exactly whe- ther the enamel in this case had actually been formed after the tooth had burst through the dental sac, Retzius instituted a comparison between this and the same tooth in another horse, whose third milk-molar in the lower jaw was about to be shed, and to be succeeded by its lengtliy

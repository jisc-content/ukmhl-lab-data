52 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, from before backwards, and parallel to the axis of the tooth. They are less regular in the side teeth, which have several apices, and particularly in that part of them, which in the crown forms the wall of the cavity of the pulp; also in that side of the root which in thin preparations is shown to be a continuation of this wall, lying close to the longitudinal axis of the tooth : finally, they are less regular at the extremity of the roots. In a perpendicular section of the front teeth from right to left, or from left to right, most of the tubes in the crown are seen to approach a perpendicular direction, and they are generally straight. As Leeuwenhoek, and also Purkinje and Fraenkel have remarked, the most internal tubes in the crown are generally perpendicular; those on the sides of the crown, more oblique ; and those further down towards the root, more transverse: in some roots, the lowest of all are again oblique. Besides the larger curves, the tubes, when more highly magnified, present an immense number of other short curvatures, of which Retzius says he has counted so many as two hundred in the extent of a line. These curvatures, however, are very various in dif- ferent teeth. In the milk-teeth they are generally fewer in number, and more lengthy ; they are also fainter to- wards the outer extremities of the tubes than at their cen- tres. Besides these are seen, particularly in old teeth, other curvatures more or less deep, which in a number of contiguous tubes correspond to each other ; and it is these nearly parallel flexions which principally form the con- centric lines, running nearly parallel with the inner sur- face of the tooth, and of which Leeuwenhoek remarked, that they could not be produced by tubes running in a longitudinal direction. Wlien the tooth is being formed, tlie outer extremities of the tulies arc first developed ; these groAv inwards of course.

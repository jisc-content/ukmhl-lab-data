He relates a series of curious anomalies in the developement of the teeth, and speaks of a case of four successive dentitions. Ambrose Par^:, who wrote in the year 1579, gives a very correct account of the teeth, of their number, position, and uses, and of their attachments to, and connexions . with, adjacent parts.

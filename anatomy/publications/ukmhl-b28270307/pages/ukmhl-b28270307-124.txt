HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 102 in an external direction, partly crossing each other, and nearly resembling tubes. In the Balistes Vetula, the tubes are more minute than in the spams, being liW" p. m. broad ; they are beau- tifully parallel, with the exception of their more recent parts in the coronal end of the cavity of the pulp. Their undulations were very faint, and very lengthy. Their distance from each other was scarcely equal to the breadth of a single tube. The larger branches lie close to the trunks, whilst the smaller ones, for the most part, curve away from them in a transverse direction. Near the surface of the tooth the ends of the main tubes themselves presented considerable parallel curvatures. The greater part of the tooth of this animal is covered by a thick, hard and strong enamel, which looks, in many places, as if the tubes of the dental bone were continued into it, and which, like that of the spams, is full of fur- rows, coursing in an external direction. Round the root- end of the tooth there appeared to be also a sort of cor- tical substance. The rest of the fish-teeth which Retzius examined, con- sisted, for the most part, of a more imperfect dental bone, with a number of larger tubes forming rude anastomoses, and nearly resembling the soft imperfectly developed dental bone, which fills up the interior of the teeth of the bradypus. The cells in the above-mentioned cortical substance Avere large, extremely irregular, terminating immediately in each other, or being, as it were, confounded together. The course of the minute bundles of tubes Avas also in the liighest degree irregular. The cortical covering Avas very tliin, and terminated immediately under the bordei of the enamel.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 58 â€¢ Plate A. 1. Fig. 1. the adult tooth, this deposit, Retzius imagines, is, as it were,dislodged,or pushed away, or remains in such a small proportion that it cannot he recognised in an isolated state. The enamel-fibres app6ar under the microscojie as small angular needles, about one-five-hundredth of alinep.M. in diameter. On many of them are small, crowded, trans- verse streaks, of which some run round the entire fibre, some round only a part of it. The fibres are seen in con- nexion with each other when thin slices of enamel cut longitudinally through the cavitas pulpse, and near its central line, are examined under the microscope. Under a sufficiently magnifying power, the transverse lines are also visible in several parts of such a preparation. In some places they are close together ; in others, at a dis- tance from each other; some are continued across several fibres ; others have an irregular course somewhat like that of a line of mortar in a brick-wall.* Retzius has not suc- ceeded in ascertaining how these lines are produced, but presumes, that if the enamel-fibre itself be an inorganic mass which is surrounded by an organic capsule, they belong to the latter and not to the former. The enamel-fibres rest with one extremity on the mem- brane mentioned above, which is pressed closely on the surface of the dental bone. In human teeth Retzius saw distinctly, that this surface formed a number of small points, and between these were small, slight, but tolerably regular indentations, in which the enamel-fibres termi- nated. In man, the fibres support themselves on this sur- face at different angles; the lowest are generally trans- verse, and those which form the masticating surface of the

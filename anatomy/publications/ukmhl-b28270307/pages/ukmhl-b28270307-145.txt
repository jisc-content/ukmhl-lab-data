123 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. and one of the best proofs that the latter is a mere depo- sit from the saliva, is the fact that we find thick crusts of it round artificial teeth.” The labours of Purkinje, Muller, and Retzius on the structure of the teeth have now been recorded, and the views entertained by these jihysiologists have been most ably investigated and confirmed by Mr. Owen, who has submitted to microscopical examination the teeth of se- veral other animals both recent and fossil. From an ex- cellent report of these researches read at the last meeting of the British Association, I have great satisfaction in finding, that he has arrived at the same conclusion, which I had previously embodied in the first announcement of this work, viz.—that the structure of the teeth, as mani- fested by means of the microscope, forms a new, distinct, and sjiecific guide for classifying the different members of the animal kingdom, and determining their respective types. From the enduring nature of these organs, the cha- racteristic modifications which they present, will form, as Mr. Owen has admirably pointed out, a most valuable accession to geological science. I have now to give an account of a .series of investi- gations in a different department of the subject, viz. on the Developement of the Teeth. Here we must not expect the brilliant display of beautiful construction and diver- sified forms with which the above details present us , but on the other liand we may hope to arrive at more practically useful results; for on a correct knowledge of tlieir developement must the pathology of these organs be founded.

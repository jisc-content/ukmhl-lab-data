129 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. cording to Blake only the outer one is vascular: Fox, Meckel, and E. H. Weber, on the other hand, state that both are vascular. Into this sacculus the vessels and nerves enter through an orifice opposite to the external side. Between the two membranes there is a fluid, which, according to Meckel, has at first a reddish and then a whitish yellow colour, but which Meissner says is as clear as water, or only turbid from a few flakes swim- ming in it, inodorous, tasting like mucus, easily drawn into strings or threads, containing a free acid, (probably lactic acid,) mucus, (hut this is doubtful according to E. H. Weber,) a little albumen, phosphate of lime (more in that of the permanent than in that of the milk-teeth,) and muriatic and sulphatic salts. On analyzing this fluid in a young calf, its components were found to be essentially the same. It contained, however, more mucus, and a free alkali was found in the place of the free acid. Within the sacculus is developed the germ of the tooth as a small, soft, compact, roundish corpuscle, in which the shape of the crown is soon manifest, and subse- quently the form of the neck. â€œThe teeth consist in general, as Purkinje and I shall demonstrate at length in our dissertation on the struc- ture of bone, of fibres or tubes lying one above the other, and running like radii towards the central axis, and which are either straight or uniformly curved supe- riorly or inferiorly. Not a trace of osseous corpuscles is found between them in the fully-developed state. The first formative mass of the tooth consists likewise of a granular substance, which, however, is transparent where it is not granular. Here the globules arrange themselves in the same direction as is taken by the subsequent fibres : it almost seemed to me as if the globules themselves dis- K

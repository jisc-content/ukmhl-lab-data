HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 95 to the medullary canals in deer-liorns which have been shed. Retzius presumes that they are here the small and scattered remains of the cavity of the pulp, since it is very evident that the closing of the cavity of the pulp in the walrus is connected with a division of the pulp itself, which seems to be separated into a number of long threads, and round these the above-described, small, dental corpuscules, constituting the central substance, begin to form in the shape of projections, which, when they are cut transversely, are found to have a central cavity from which main tubes radiate in all directions. The cortical substance in the walrus invests the canine as well as the molar teeth, and is deposited in such im- mense quantity round the latter, that the small teeth lose through it their proper form, as has been above de- scribed. The internal structure of this substance is re- markable, from the abundance of almost parallel, rami- fying, thick-set tubes which it presents, and between which the cells lie scattered. These tubes run, too, per- pendicularly, so to say, towards the surface of the dental bone, and seem, as it were, to commence and terminate in the different layers in which this substance was formed. They are, however, by far less regular and parallel than the tubes in the dental bone. Besides the cells them- selves, the interstices are also filled in a great measure by a net-work of minute tubes. The tubes which enter the cells form thick bundles round them, which seem to be largest on the external side of the cells. In lon- gitudinally-cut slices the cells were of the form of an almond: they were about sin line p. m. in length, and about half that in width. The tubes of the cortical sub- stance entered into numerous connexions with the finer terminations of the tubes of the dental bone, particularly

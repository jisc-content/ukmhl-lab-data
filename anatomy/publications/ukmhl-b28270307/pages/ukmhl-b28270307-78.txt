HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 56 with Professor Muller that they consisted of an inorganic or earthy substance, which, when seen on a dark ground, seems white, and which disappears when the preparation is submitted to the action of diluted muriatic acid. When the light falls into the canals, this matter is seen to be composed apparently of infinitely fine particles, adhering together in lumps. The greater or less number and dis- tinctness of these lumps seem to depend on the degTee in which the preparation has been penetrated by water, oil, or turpentine. The Enamel, according to Berzelius, “ after its solution in acids, leaves no cartilage, but only an extremely slight, brown, membranous tissue, which had adhered to its inner surface. On being submitted to fire, it is not at all black- ened externally, and but very little internally; has a slight ammoniacal odour; and it loses, after having been well dried, less than two per cent, of its weight by burning. Hence we see that it essentially contains no ammoniacal matter.” After quoting this passage, Retzius states that the enamel is adherent internally to a thin membrane, which, he continues, is probably the remains of that sur- rounding the organ for the production of the enamel, which has been described in such a masterly manner by Purkinje. This membrane resists, for a long time, the action of water. In teeth which had been macerated for several months in water, he has found it remaining on his separating and dissolving the enamel in acids. To his great astonishment, when he once dissolved in diluted muriatic acid a large slice of enamel from the fossil tooth of a horse, (which had been dug out of a turf-moor,) he found, after the solution had been effected, this membrane floating at the top of the fluid. He examined it under a glass of considerable magnifying power, and found it

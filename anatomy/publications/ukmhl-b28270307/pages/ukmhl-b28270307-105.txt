The outer surface of this recent cortical substance was already porous, and on the border, towards the root, it was depo- sited in small, separate, undulating rings. Elephas Indicus. — Of the elephant, Retzius only ex- amined sections of the tusks. For the investigation of their tubular structure, slices were taken out of the hollow alveolar end, because in them the whole extent of the tubes from their commencement in the cavitas pulpcs to their termination towards the cortical substance can be surveyed in a smaller compass. For the examination of the concentric rings, he used more transversely cut sections, which were taken from nearer the apex of the tusk. The main tubes at their commencement at the cavitas pulpce, and afterwards in their entire course, are much smaller than in the human subject: on an average they present a diameter of toto'" p. m. Their distance from each other scarcely amounts to the breadth of a single tube. They are undulating, though to an almost imperceptible degree, but, on the other hand, they present a number of nearly angular parallel curvatures, of which some folloAV each other at a distance of ^'p- m., some at rather a greater interval. These curvatures point in different directions— some upwards, others downwards; some to the right, others to the left: or, to express it more properly, they appear to run on two planes which cross, or are at right angles to each other. In these curvatures the concen- tric rings are formed, of which more will be stated below. In these, as in most other teeth, the calibre of the tubes G 2

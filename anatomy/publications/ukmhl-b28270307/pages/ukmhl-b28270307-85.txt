63 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tremely thin stratum, taking its origin in most teeth Avitli a complete root at the neck where the enamel terminates, and increasing in size as it descends towards the extremity of the root, where it is generally thickest. In young teeth, of which the roots are not yet fully developed, it is so thin that the osseous cells in it are not percejitihle ; and it has merely the appearance of a delicate memhrane. On the other hand, the older a tooth is, and the more the cavitas imlpse is closed, the thicker is the cortical suh- stance at the end of the root, where it sometimes forms a considerable enlargement, or what is commonly called an exostosis. Retzius has seen a case where this increment was of the length of three lines at the root; and has also examined a wise tooth, where the cortical substance was so plentiful at the neck, that it formed a sharp projecting border turned towards the crown, and gave to the whole tooth an uncouth appearance. In teeth projecting con- siderably from the alveolus, and which have not been worn away, Retzius found it sometimes thicker than the dental hone itself, and this he thinks is particularly the case in those teeth which have been loosened by the scurvy, or by the use of mercury. Retzius has not only examined the teeth of the human subject, but also those of the Cercointhecus ajnomolgus, Felis lynx, Cams familiaris, Erinaceus europceus, Sorex fodiens.

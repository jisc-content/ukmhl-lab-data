HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 39 a distinct organ. The first of these is the central portion or bulb, which produces the ivory; the second is in the form of a membrane, and produces the enamel; the third, called by our author the external, envelopes all the others, and produces the cortical or external ivory. The bulb, he says, appears to he entirely composed of nerves and vessels, and is surrounded by the “ membrane emaillante,” excejit at its base, corresponding to the neck of the tooth where the membrane terminates. It is de- prived of vessels and disappears entirely when the func- tions of the external membrane commence. The external membrane he describes as highly vascular, and as forming an external pulp : he assigns to it the formation of the cortical substance, and the protection of all the other for- mative processes of dentition. “ Elle est percce’' he adds, “ a son sommet par Vevolution de la dent, mais ses bords sattachent aux gencives, et en deviennent en quelque sorte la continuation.” (P. xxiv.) In the tusks of the elephant, he considers that the ivory is deposited in concentric layers, and refers for proof of this to fossil remains : its texture differs, however, in dif- ferent animals—in man, the monkey, and in carnivorous animals, for instance, it appears to be fibrous. It is of a uniform contexture in the whale, hippopotamus, &c., whilst the teeth of the orycteropus seem formed of longitudinal and parallel fibres, “ qui rappellent la structure dujonc.” The enamel F, Cuvier describes as apparently crystal- line, and as deposited in a direction contrary to that of the ivory. According to him, the cortical substance is of “ absolutely the same” nature as the ivory—generally speaking, it contains only gelatine and phosphate of lime ; but in some cases colouring matter in addition, as for

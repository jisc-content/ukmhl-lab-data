HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 42 mination of subjects, in whom some teeth of the first den- tition were apparent, on the enamel of which were observed points similar to those produced by engraving or chisel- ing ; which proves that these inflammations having at- tacked a greater or less quantity of the small vesicles which secrete the enamel, at the moment when nature was engaged in the formation of the dental system, de- prived of this substance all the places where they caused ulceration and the destruction of these excretory glands, leaving there furrows, which are called erosions (page 240.) In regard to the accidents which the teeth experience, he attaches considerable importance to the cracking of the enamel by rapid alternations of heat and cold, and cites an old adage, “ that a glass of wine drunk immediately after soup draws a crown from the pocket of the physi- cian, and puts it into that of the dentist.” Caries of the teeth, according to this author, is simply ulceration—many causes, both internal and external, pre- dispose to this malady, as a scrofulous or scorbutic dia- thesis, the humidity or particular character of the atmo- sphere, the nature of the water which is drunk, &c. &c. The latter causes are supposed to operate in the province of Caux in France, and in the neighbourhood of Beau- vais in Picardy, where the greater part of the inhabitants have the two centre incisors of the upper jaw decayed : after these the laterals begin to be affected, and so on, so that by the time the individual has arrived at the age of thirty, he has in general lost almost all his teeth.

He remarks, “ that the in- habitants of large cities are most subject to decay of the

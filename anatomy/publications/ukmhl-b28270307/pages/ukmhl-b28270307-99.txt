IIISTORTCAL INTRODUCTION. 77 found running from witliln outwards. Tlie above-men- tioned gland-like cells were about is line p. m. in diameter : the thickness of tbe large tubes was s less. It was particu- larly remarkable tbat there were frequent and consider- able communications between the cortical cells and tbe cells in the outer part of the dental bone. The cortical substance in tbe dental furrows was porous in the highest degree, and consisted of still more irregular tubes and cells, than in the above-mentioned places. Bos Taurus.â€”In an incisor and in a molar tooth of the Ox, Retzius found the organisation to be very similar to that in the sheep. The molar tooth being an old one, the small cavities for the foliform prolongations of the pulp were found to be nearly closed by the dental substance. In this last-formed dental substance the tubes were very undulating, and in different directions ; in the midst of it were several yellow bodies lying longitudinally in rows, and the tubes wound spirally round about these. In the incisor as well as in the molar tooth, the main tubes dis- played a, plentiful ramification ; some of the branches being long and generally parallel; others short, trans- versely-running, curved, delicate, and forming, as it were, a downy net-work. The extreme ends of the tubes in the neighbourhood of the enamel showed the same mixture of extremely fine osseous corpuscules as in the sheep. The tubes also resembled those in the sheep with respect to their undulations, curvatures, and gradual diminution. Tlie diameter of the main tubes, near the cavitas jjuIjjcb, varied from sU" to ms" p. m. The cortical substance in the ox is much thicker than in the sheep; the large tubes were here found to ramify, and ran in an almost horizontal direction towards the sides of the tooth. The cells were smaller and more irre-

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. G1 Tlie second set of appearances above alluded to, is that of short, white, generally curved streaks, broad in propor- tion to their length, which are hardly perceptible to the naked eye, hut which may he easily seen with the aid of a lens : at the end of the enamel, towards the neck of the tooth, they strongly incline outwards, and in the crown are turned towards each other, as it were, in an upright position. They are only visible under a slight magnifying- power on a dark ground, and run sometimes in the same direction as the enamel-fibres, and sometimes in a different one. Under a full light they disappear, and in their place, by the aid of a glass of considerable power, is seen a sort of very faint broad streaks, formed by the meeting of the parallel shadows of the transverse lines of the enamel- fibres. Retzius found them in the enamel of most of the mammalia which he examined, and in greater quantity than elsewhere in the rings on its surface. At its junction with the dental hone, and also in some other parts, the enamel almost always presents a number of delicate chinks, which appear to arise from its fibres shrinking fi-om each other. Where this has taken place, they often present a dentated appearance like the fibres in the crystalline lens. When thin sections of a tooth are left for some hours in a solution of caustic potash, groups of these chinks are observed in different parts of them. This fact confirms Retzius in the opinion that the enamel-fibres are surrounded by delicate capsules of orga- nic matter. The chinks were particularly remarkable in the enamel of the teeth of the Balistes Vetula and Sparus Jlondeletii: they were here very numerous, almost regular in their course, and somewhat similar to the tubes in dental bone.

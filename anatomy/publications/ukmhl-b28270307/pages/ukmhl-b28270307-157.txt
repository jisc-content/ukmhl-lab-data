HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 135 either by the compressor, or in another manner hy being- placed under water. This enamel-hood, so to call it, presents, towards the basilary part of the dental germ, a margin which is at first obtuse, afterwards sharp, but which is always free at every part: moreover, it still ap- pears to be altogether as freely situated between the capsu- lar membrane and the dental germ as previously when it existed under the form of a globular nucleus, and is pro- bably everywhere surrounded by the lymph above men- tioned. The inquii’ies respecting the connexion of the enamel-organ with the capsule have not yet been com- pleted. At first it appears to be altogether free in the capsular fluid ; subsequently, however, at the extremity of the capsule, that is to say, in the coronal region, some connexion exists by means of loose vessels; moreover, the parenchyma of the organ itself is seen to be pervaded by numerous capillaries, and these facts prove that from the commencement this organ is connected with the capsule. If this is the case, we may assume that the dental germ takes its origin from that extremity of the capsule which is towards the root, the enamel-organ from the coronal extremity, since both these organs, arising at opposite points, approach each other, are adapted to- gether, and contribute together towards the formation of the tooth. “ When the enamel-organ has assumed the form of a hood, a peculiar organ is perceived on the surface of that cavity in which the dental germ is lodged, consisting all of it of short uniform fibres placed perpendicularly to the surface of the cavity, and forming, as it were, a silky lining to the whole of the latter. In a transverse sec- tion of the enamel-organ, this stratum of perpendicular filires is clearly seen, and can be accurately distinguished

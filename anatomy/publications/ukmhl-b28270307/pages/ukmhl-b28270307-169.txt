147 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, rally secreted, sufficiently show the peculiar difference between these processes. We have already mentioned the law of polarity which obtains in the whole course of dental developement, and we leave to the reader more closely to study the point which is called indifferential, because it is contained in the contact of both substances, the dental and the enamel; further, the jiolaric opposi- tion between the enamel-membrane and the prseforma- tive membrane, between the enamel-parenchyma and the dental germ, and, finally, between the region of the gum and that of the nerves of the capsule of the tooth. “ This would be the most fitting place to treat more at large of the formation of the cement, of which we have already made mention. As, however, we ourselves are deficient in experience with regard to many points belong- ing to this subject, and the opinions of authors respecting it are vague, we have only ventured here to form our own opinion derived partly from the examination of the sub- stance of the tooth with the microscope, in reference to its structure and developement. “ The cement is always placed externally to the enamel. It is consequently formed at a later period^ and after, in- deed, the formation of the latter is completed, and the enamel-membrane has disappeared, or been in some way transformed. At first the enamel-pulp is situated close to the enamel-membrane ; and if it does not disappear toge- ther with the latter, it is perhaps that which serves to de- posit the cement. But if it does vanish with this mem- brane, there then remains only the capsular membrane to answer this purpose, which, however, at the advanced period when the cement begins to be formed, doubtless coalesces with the periosteum of the alveolar parietes. The following fact greatly supports the opinion that the

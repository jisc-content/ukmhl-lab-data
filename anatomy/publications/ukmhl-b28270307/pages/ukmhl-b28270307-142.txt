HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 120 “ ternally, (both of which are abundantly supplied with “ vessels.) These fluids, without circulating in organic “ canals, may operate much towards the preservation of the “ tooth, as also towards the decay of the dental substance “ when their composition is morbid.” “ When milk-teeth are examined just before they are about to be shed, they are found to present an appearance as if, from pressure of their permanent successors, they had wasted or been absorbed at the root. The crown of the advancing tooth appears to have pressed itself into the extremity of the deciduous one. I have carefully examined how this appearance is produced, and have come to the decided conviction that neither tabescence, absorption, nor erosion, has anything to do with it. “In the milk-teeth which presented it, I found the radical extremity quite entire, as also the small cavitas pulpse and the deep enamel furrows which, in the horse, descend from the crown, and are filled with cortical substance. I found moreover, on making transverse sections of them, that their roots assumed a form corresponding to that of the crown of the advancing tooth, by growing round and closely shutting in the latter. “ In the teeth a greater degree of hardness is required than in any other part of the organism, and a hardness moreover combined with the same tenacity which exists in bone. They are destined to be subject to almost con- stant pressure ; and that property in which they differ from bone, of not disappearing under or being affected by pressure, must hence be a necessary condition for the fulfilment oftheir function. This property, which is only found besides in the corneous structures of the skin, is owing, in the teeth, to the circumstance that the solid parts once formed are not changed, but are con-

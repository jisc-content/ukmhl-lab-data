43 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. teeth—that the dog, the faithful companion of man, in good or bad fortune, is often attacked by it, and that the cat, which inhabits our houses, is equally liable to it.” Savage tribes, on the contrary, appear to retain their teeth in health, although worn. Carnivorous animals have very healthy teeth: in the savage state, indeed, time appears to effect no change in them, except that by degrees they become worn down. Amongst other cases of disease in the teeth, Rousseau mentions one of a bony growth internally, and another of exostosis of the fang, similar in structure to the latter. In the excellent edition of Hildebrand’s “ Handhuch der Anatomie” by Weber, we find the following on the structure of the ivory: “ Although its fracture in recent teeth is smooth, and shows no fibres or leaves, still many facts prove that its substance is not quite uniform. The fractured surface has a bright silky lustre, which is still more perceptible when it is polished. In teeth which have been fractured longitudinally, bright lines are seen, curved in much the same manner as is the inner surface of the cavity of the tooth on the side which is towards the surface ; whence we may presume that the osseous substance of the tooth consists of several con- centric layers, which we have no method of separating from each other. Teeth are also more easily broken longi- tudinally than in any other direction ; and Rudolphi ob- served that when the osseous substance of the crown was separated in very diluted nitric acid from its investment of enamel, the crown (but not the roots) divides longitudi- nally into several pieces, of which the number is tolerably definite in the different classes of human teeth. In Weber’s edition of Roscnmiiller’s “ Handbuch der Anato-

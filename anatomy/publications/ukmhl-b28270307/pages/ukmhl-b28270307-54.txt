HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 32 where the vessels and nerves penetrate, it detaches itself from the external layer, to which it does not henceforth seem to he united, except hy means of small vessels which pass from one layer to the other. Being now isolated from the external layer, it is reflected from below up- wards, and envelopes the vessels and nerves as far as the base and the inferior circumference of the pulp, where it is evidently inserted ; whether it is continued over the surface of the pulp or not, I cannot say; hut I have never been able to follow it further than the base, though I have made several careful attempts. It results from this arrangement, 1st, that the sac formed hy this layer is closed above hy the dental pulp, which forms a kind of lid to it; 2ndly, that this pulp is not enveloped by the membrane, and that it is free in the interior of the sac which it forms, bathed by the fluid which it secretes; 3rdly, also that the external membrane is prolonged no further than the place where the vessels and nerves pass in order to penetrate the dental germ, and that it closely adheres to them.” (P, 14.) Serres next proceeds to give an account of the dental arteries and nerves, and states that although the adult subject possesses only one canal, the foetus, and even the infant till its sixth or seventh year, (or till that age when the removal of the first tooth commences,) possess two canals for the transmission of vessels; he gives a drawing of this arrangement, which I believe is far from having- been established as a constant appearance. “ From whatever trunk,” says this author, “ are derived the vascular branches which penetrate the roots of the teeth, their distribution in the germs is always the same. When they reach the base of the tooth, they pierce the external layer of the membrane, and are continued to the

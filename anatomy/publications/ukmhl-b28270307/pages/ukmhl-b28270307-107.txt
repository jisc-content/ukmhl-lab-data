HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 85 figures, as it were, obliquely, and wliicli partly run into each other. The latter streaks corresponding to the arched ones which cross each other obliquely in the transverse section, arise, like these from the refraction of the rays of light, by the parallel curvatures of the main tubes. They appear in longitudinal as well as in transverse sections from this cause, that the parallel curvatures, as has been already remarked, run in two planes, which intersect each other, or, as it does not seem improbable, they run spirally. In the elephant, Retzius only examined the cortical substance which invests the canine teeth. The cells varied little in size or form; some were oval, but the most were almost round ; their size was about sm line p. m. The small vessels terminating in them were so minute, that they could not well be distinguished. What principally cha- racterises the organisation of this substance is the almost parallel and horizontal running, undulating tubes, which evidently approach the appearance of the tubes in the dental bone. The larger of the tubes were ^ line p. M. broad; the smaller tm line. Although, when cur- sorily examined, they appeared to be continued from the surface of the tooth to that of the dental bone itself, Retzius found, on closer investigation, that this was not the case. They appeared to be continued partly because they had the same direction, and partly because the miâ€™- nuter terminations projected^ as it were, beyond each other. As well in the outer as in the inner surface of this substance, they terminated in ends which became gra- dually finer, and which most internally were curved to- wards tlie wall of the dental bone. They gave off from their sides a number of larger and smaller brandhes, which entered into numerous communications with the conti-

33 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. internal layer, on which they ramify to such an extent that this portion of it is rendered entirely vascular in ap- pearance. Beyond the point where the internal layer of the membrane is inserted, several branches penetrate the substance of the dental bulb. I have followed them to the distance of a line from the point where dental ossifi- cation takes place. It is to be remarked, that all round the jJoint of insertion of the internal layer into the base of the bulb, the vessels are much more numerous than at any other part, and that they form a vascular circle simi- lar to the anterior and posterior circles of the iris; it is also to be remarked, that this circle, or this reddish areola, which they form on the bulb, descends in propor- tion as ossification advances, a circumstance which results from the mechanism of the formation of the teeth. It is worthy of notice and admiration, that these vessels, in teeth with a single root, form only a single bundle; in teeth with double roots, they form two bundles; and they are divided into three or four, if the tooth is to have three or four roots.‚Äù (P. 19.) In this work of Serres we find a minute account of the dental nerves, and of a plexus which, he says, is situated beneath the incisors and canines ; and this is accomjaanied by some excellent remarks on the sympathetic pains ex- perienced in the teeth and adjoining parts. He is almost the first who pointed out what he calls the dental glands, which he describes as small sacs or cysts dis- posed in regular groups spread over the whole cartilaginous substance which forms the gums of the new-born infant. Their function, he considers, consists in lubricating the cartilages of the gums; they also, he thinks, assist the infant in the act of sucking, by retaining the nipple of the mother. He has succeeded in pressing a fluid like serum D

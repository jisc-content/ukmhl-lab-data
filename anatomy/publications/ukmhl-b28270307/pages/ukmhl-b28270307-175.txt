153 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. of two distinct laminae. There are writers who hold that the pulp is covered by a proper membrane, which they conjecture is a continuation of the periosteum of the jaw ; but the very existence of this membrane is denied by others : a third opinion is, that a proper membrane exists, but that it only partially covers the pulp. The observa- tion of only a limited number of subjects must be the cause of this diversity of opinion, as there can be no doubt that the capsule consists of two layers, that both these layers are vascular at certain periods of their de- velopement, and also that a proper membrane exists on the surface of the pulp. Anatomists are far from being agreed as to the source whence the capsular vessels are derived : they have their origin exclusively in the gum, according to some, and in the dental trunks^ according to others. My own opinion is, that they derive their origin from both these sources. There is one opinion which has been uniformly main- tained by all writers on this subject, viz. that when the teeth of man, or other analogous simple teeth, are ex- truded, the enamel is divested of all external covering, and exposed immediately to the atmosphere, denuded of both the envelopes of capsule and mucous membrane which it possessed during what has been called the sac- cular stage ; and this denudation has always been sup- posed to be effected by the disruption of these coverings. My own views, however, on this point, which are con- tained in a paper read some time ago before the Medical and Chirurgical Society, are different from those generally received; and I have no doubt that I shall be able to prove that it is a process of absorption, and not of disrup- tion, by means of which the tooth is emancipated, and that when perfected and extruded it is still invested with

133 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. manner the dental nerves send no small quantity of branches to this surface. “ The membrane itself of the follicle of the tooth is not to be considered as altogether fibrous, because its fibres are extremely soft, and are intermixed with much granular parenchyma. In the first weeks of the life of tlie foetus (in the calf till about the eighth week), the fol- licle of the tooth has not yet grown into union with the gum; for both the epithelium of the latter, which then, compared with its state at subsequent periods, is found of a considerable size, and a certain peculiar stratum of its parenchyma, are easily separated from the dental follicle, so that in the coronal part it appears altogether free, and is only in the region of the dental arteries and nerves closely adherent to them. “ The internal plane of the dental follicle is smooth, and exhibits the appearance of a serous membrane. The membrane is everywhere free, except in that place where the dental germ proceeds from it. For the dental germ appears to proceed from nowhere else except from the internal plane of the follicle of the tooth, and from that part of it where the principal vessels and nerves enter . into it, since between its substance and the membrane of the follicle there is a very close and uninterrupted con- nexion. “ In the internal chamber of the follicle or capsule, between its internal surface and the dental germ, ano- ther organ is also found, which at first, almost before the first stage of the growth of the dental germ, forms a nearly globular nucleus, of which the external surface appears in some slight degree to bulge out, and of which tlie internal substance presents a singular parenchyma, consisting probably at first, before evolution has been

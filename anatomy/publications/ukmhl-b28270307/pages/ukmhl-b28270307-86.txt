HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. G4 tubes are of about the same size as in the human sub- ject. Retzius only saw branches at the extremities of the tubes which belong to the crowns of the molar teeth. Here and there in the neck a larger branch is given off; and down at the root all the main tubes are surrounded by extremely delicate, subdividing, and thick-set branches, given off in almost opposite directions, of which those which run towards the crown are the largest. They are for the most part curved like a bow, and in such a way that the concavity of the arch is turned towards the cavi- tas pulpcB. The undulating curvatures of the main tubes themselves seemed to be longer drawn out and less nu- merous than in man. In the monkey, the cortical substance begins where the enamel terminates. The cells are somewhat larger and closer together than in man; but are also of several different forms, as triangular, circular, oblong, with pointed extre- mities, &c. The majority of the tubes which terminated in them came from without, and the greater number opened into that side of the cells which looked from the axis of the tooth. Most of the fine calcareous tubes opened into the cells without any particular widening at the basis. Felis Lynx.â€”Of the lynx he examined two canine teeth, and two of the most posterior molar teeth : they had all been kept for some time in alcohol. In both kinds of teeth, the tubes appeared of the same size as in man. In the canine teeth, which, although the animal was very young, were nearly closed at the end of the root, the tubes, towards the external part of the whole tooth, presented numerous and beautiful branches: these branches di- vided and subdivided, forming at length a net-work like down.^ In many parts lay, as it were in scattered rows.

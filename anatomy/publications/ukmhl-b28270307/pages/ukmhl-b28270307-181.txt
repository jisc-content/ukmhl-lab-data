159 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. But all tliis is flatly contradicted by the next writer, Blandin, who maintains that all that has been advanced on the other side of the question is marked “ au coin de la plus pure hypothese.” Mr. Tomes, the latest labourer in this field of in- quiry—the author of an excellent paper in the Me- dical Gazette, No. 585—adopts the conclusion, that “ of the several parts which have been treated of, all, save the enamel, are vascular, and he would not deny even to this all connexion with the circulating fluids.” Thus on each side we have writers of equal authority ; and the points at issue remain altogether unsettled by any positive anatomical demonstration, although they are of great practical importance, and so prominent as to demand the active scrutiny of the student of nature. In short, the impression left on the mind of the student, after having perused the works which have been pub- lished in this department of science is, that almost every point requires to be investigated anew. How various and contradictory are the opinions of writers on the composition and structure of the teeth! Hippocrates taught that they were composed of hardened fat. Leeuwenhoek was the first who stated that their structure is tubular, and this doctrine, after having been forgotten for one hundred and sixty years, has lately re- appeared in a most attractive garb.

Rousseau describes their structure as being longitudinally striated. Blandin, who wrote so late as

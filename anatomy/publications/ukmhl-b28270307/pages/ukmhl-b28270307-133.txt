HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Ill tubes subsequently divide into beautiful, parallel, minuter branches, which form numerous reticular anastomoses wdth each other, and which partly occupy the interstices: they terminate externally in the same way as in the ling. The larger trunks of these tubes were in a great mea- sure filled with a red matter, which was doubtless a pro- duction of the pulp. The more minute calcigerous tubes were very indistinct. Cyprinus Idus.â€”In the carp, which has only teeth in its pharynx, the structure of these organs is very similar to that in the balistes. They contain a considerable ca- vity of the pulp, which extends through almost the entire length of the tooth, and partly also laterally into the bone beneath the fastening of the tooth, where there is an orifice for the entrance of vessels from within. When these teeth are viewed with the naked eye, and also with the lens, their points are seen to be tipped with a white, transparent substance, resembling enamel, but Retzius could not render himself certain that it was such by the aid of the microscope. The tubes of the dental bone are tolerably regular and parallel; their thickness near their commencement at the cavity of the pulp is amra'" p. m. They bifurcate, and the divisions run parallel with each other; but the more minute branches, particularly those towards the outer part of the tooth, diverge more, and run, as in the balistes, in a direction towards the base of the tooth. Hence the branches are most beautiful, most abundant, and most distinct towards the external part of the tooth. Cuvier, as well as Von Born, was acquainted with the tubular structure in different fish-teeth; but both seem to have considered the tubes, or fibres as they call them, as undivided, and as running parallel from the cavity of the pulp to the end of the dental lione. Von Born says, ex-

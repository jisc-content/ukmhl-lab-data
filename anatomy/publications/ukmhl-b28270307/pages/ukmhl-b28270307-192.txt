Plate A. 2, Fig, 1, a. “ The most interior portion of the tubes of the dental bone in an incisor of a child two years old, close to their commencement in the cavitas pulpae, in order to show their first division. Plate A. 2, Fig. 1, h.—“ The external portion of the tubes of the same tooth, exhibiting their more minute ramifications, which, for the most part, turn towards the crown,” Plate A. 2, Fig, 2, a.—“ The external portion of the tubes of the dental bone in the incisor of the hare.” Plate A. 2, Fig. 2, h.—“ A single main tube of the same tooth.” Plate A. 2, Fig. 3.—“ A main tube, with its branches in the tooth of the Squalus Cornubicus.” Plate A. 3. Fig. 4.—“ The tubes of the dental bone in the tooth of a Delphinus Delphis, near the cavitas pulpae, showing a group of irregular larger osseous cells and anas- tomoses in one of the oval spots, which, as it were, has pushed aside the regular main tubes. Similar irregular groups of cells are seen in the teeth of several mamma- lia, and even in the centre of human teeth where the cavity is filled with ossific matter.” Plate A. 3, Fig. 5.—“ The tubes of the dental bone in the Python Bivittatus, the branches of which are given off from that side of the main tubes which is turned towards the root of the tooth,” Plate A. 3, Fig. 6,—“ The external part of the tubes of the dental bone in the incisor of an adult Horse, show- ing the numerous cells into which the minute termina- tions of the tubes finally enter. The closely-placed cells form the fine concentric parallel lines in this dental bone.”

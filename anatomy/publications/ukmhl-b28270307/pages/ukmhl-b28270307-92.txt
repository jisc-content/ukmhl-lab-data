70 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. substitute, and he found that the latter was the shorter by nearly an inch, and did not disjilay the sligditest trace of the formation of a root. If we assume that it might still have grown a quarter of an inch before bursting through the dental sac, (which, however, round the crown was already absorbed,) three quarters of an inch of the enamel investment still remains, which had been formed after the dental sac had been burst through in the alveolus. But though, as we have seen, the enamel in certain horses’ teeth may be deposited as far as the di- vided roots, this is not universally the case in this class of animals. In the molar teeth of very old horses, with long roots, the latter are only covered with enamel at the commencement; and in the milk-molar of the new-born foal, which have already divided roots, the enamel termi- nates at the commencement of the latter. The red colour in the incisor teeth of the beaver is derived from the enamel. Retzius cannot understand how that excellent writer, F. Cuvier, was so far deceived on this point, as to believe that it belonged to the cortical substance, seeing that these teeth present no cortical coat whatever. Cuvier’s words are; “ In fact, the colour of the anterior part of these teeth depends on a very de- licate layer of true cortical matter, as I have assured ^myselfby repeated particular experiments; and it only becomes brown on that part of the tooth which is not covered by the gums.” The incisor teeth of the beaver, and probably of all “ glires,” are invested with enamel. In the beaver, Retzius observed this peculiarity, that the above-described transverse lines on the enamel-fibres here run with particular regularity in straight parallel lines, which, at equal distances from each other, intersected the streaks between the enamel-fibres at oblique angles.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 93 they cannot develope themselves equally in their entire circumference, hut creep in bundles, forming beautiful parallel curvatures, between the contiguous substances. A great part of them proceed into the external, regularly- formed, dental bone, and are even continued into the main tubes which belong to it. These tubes of the dental bone, too, are abundantly and beautifully ramified, and present numerous concentric rings, which apparently owe their origin to parallel curvatures. In the lesser rings this arrangement is found to be less complete, and in the smallest there is often only a round, transparent spot, which now contains irregular scattered tubes, now con- gregated or isolated calcareous cells, &c. Calcareous cells are also scattered in almost every direction, and in great number, throughout this substance, as well between the more regular radiating bundles of tubes, as between the scattered ones, and they form everywhere frequent com- munications with the contiguous tubes. Similar contents, but of less solidity, are found in the molar teeth, where they close up the cavity of the pulp as far as the extremity of the root, which has been re- marked by G. Cuvier. This celebrated philosopher states that the teeth of the walrus are provided with enamel. His words are : “ In some animals, for instance in the walrus, the enamel surrounds the tooth on all sides. In this animal the enamel is even thicker under the root of the molar teeth than on their crown.” F. Cuvier speaks of only one substance in the tooth of the walrus: he says of the molars, “ all these teeth have but one very short root, and they are entirely formed of one single substance, which is very hard, very compact, and analogous to that of the tusks.” That which G. Cuvier calls enamel in the walrus, is in

Like these they contain a small cavity; like them they are placed as epiphyses on elevations of the maxilla ; they have all only a small patch of enamel on the apex, and their tubular structure is almost the same, with the exception of the difference which arises from the more limited extent of the cavity of the pulp. The processes on which the teeth are fastened have particularly at- tracted the attention of Cuvier. In his lectures on com- parative anatomy, he says of the anarrhichas, “ Its jaws are covered with elevations which are composed of fibres or tubes alone In the full-grown animal nothing is found besides these, and one feels inclined to regard them as teeth. .. . The sea-wolf is the only animal with which I am acquainted in which, besides the teeth, a part also of the bone (viz. the osseous elevations of which I have spoken above) falls out. The shedding of these is con- formable, as I have already mentioned, with the shedding of the horns of deer; and their separation is doubtless effected in the same manner, with this only difference, that the new elevation on which the tooth is fixed does not take precisely the place of the former one, but is de- veloped by the side of it, and only through its enlarge- ment does the hollow left by the falling out of the old one become filled up.” Retzius has examined several heads of the anarrhichas, and, from what he has found, cannot but conclude that the views of Cuvier on this point are completely false. The processes described on which the teeth are said to be si- tuated do not, he says, exist in reality. Their appearance is a mere deception, which originates in the following manner:—At a little distance from the place where the teeth are fixed, runs a border which resembles the border

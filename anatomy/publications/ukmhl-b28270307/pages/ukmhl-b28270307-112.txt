90 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, externally situated portions of the same tubes were faintly undulating, and ran parallel to each other, the interstices hetAveen them being of somewhat more than the width of a single tube. They gave off a great abundance of fur- cated branches at acute angles, stretched out in an ex- ternal direction, as well as of other short, almost oppo- sitely situated ones, which ran transversely over the inter- stices. Although a number of different, alternate layers of darker and whiter substances can be distinguished in these teeth with the naked eye, as well as with the aid of a glass, still Retzius could only perceive in a few places under the microscope definite parallel curvatures, or rings of osseous cells. The appearance of these rings seemed partly to depend on the more aggregated or scanty exit of small lateral branches from the main tubes. Immediately within the external surface of the tooth lay a beautiful layer of osseous cells, interwoven with incre- dibly minute and abundant bundles of the extreme termi- nal branches of the main tubes. In some places these extreme branches seemed to terminate in contiguous tubes and cells of the cortical substance. In the yellowish, osseous substance, which in the middle of the canine teeth had filled up that part of the cavity of the pulp which was prolonged towards the apex, a number of large cells were found, which, however, appeared to contain only very little osseous earth. Trichecus Rosmarus.â€”Of the walrus, Retzius examined the canine and molar teeth. In both, the covering of enamel Avas wanting ; but to make up for this, they were provided with a larger investment of cortical substance. The tubes bore the greatest similarity to those in the seal; they Avere of the same breadth, displayed the same degree of undulation, and the same relation to each other.

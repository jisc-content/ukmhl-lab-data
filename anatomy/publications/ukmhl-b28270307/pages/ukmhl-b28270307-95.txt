73 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. be traced by the eye. When Ave have got beyond that part of the dental cylinder, which towards the croAvn is filled with the above-mentioned plug of horny sub- stance, we find that the tooth is hollow for a considerable distance. In this hollow part, the main tubes towards the cavitas pulpse internally appear to be as it ivere dis- tended at their extremities. In this part of the tooth, these same trunks have some of them the form of any, and are also more scattered, and more evidently provided Avith large branches than those nearer the crown. The teeth of the Bradypus are covered Avith cortical substance as far upAvards as towards the masticating sur- face, and it seemed to Retzius as if the ends of the tubes in the proper osseous substance passed in many places into the cortical substance, and united with the tubes of the latter ; he thought, too, that he perceived that several of the tubular branches passing from the dental bone into the cortical substance, opened into the small calcareous cavities of the latter. This arrangement was frequently investigated, and appeared clearly to be as just described, although Retzius Avas at first as much inclined as possible to doubt its reality. It results then from the above facts, that the teeth of the Bradypus present a very Ioav degree of development, and approach, in their internal construction, as comparison will shoAv, a type of formation which seems properly to belong to certain fish, particularly to the pike. It is also proba- ble that the dental tissue in the orycteropus is analogous to the internal soft dental substance in the Bradypus. That direct communications exist between tbe tubular systems in the tAvo constituent formations, developed at difiereiit periods, that is to say, in the dental bone and cortical sub- stance, seems to lead to the conclusion that certain canals

7 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. tooth-drawer’s legs; then the tooth-draAver shall deeply scarifie about the tooth, separating the gums therefrom, and then if spoiled, as it were, of the wall of the gums, it grow loose, it must be shaken and thrust out by forc- ing it with a three-pointed levatory ; but if it stick in too fast, and will not stir at all, then must the tooth be taken hold of Avith some of the toothed forcipes, now one, then another, as the greatness, figure, and site shall seem to require. I Avould have a tooth-drawer expert and dili- gent in the use of such toothed mullets; for, unless one know readily, and cunningly how to use them, he can scarce so carry himself but that he will force out three teeth at once, ofttimes leaving that untouched which caused the pain.” (p. 416.) In the chapter of his work, “ Of the placing of teeth artificially made instead of those that are lost or want- ing,” he says, “ Teeth artificially made of bone or ivory may be put in the place of those that are wanting; and they must be joined one fast unto another, and also so fastened unto the natural teeth adjoining that are whole; and this must chiefly be done with a thread of gold or silver, or, for want of either, with a common thread of silk or flax, as it is declared at large by Hippocrates, sect. ii. lib. de art. Sent, xv.”* ScALiGER calls the teeth bone, sui generis; he denies that they have any proper sensation, and compares them in this respect to the nails. Kerkring, on the other hand, finds that they are perfectly analogous to bones ; but he devotes only a very short space to them, and concludes by saying, “ De dentibus nihil dicam aliud quani nihil esse quod hie peculiariter sit commemorandum !” • The p<a8sagc here alluded to I have not been able to find.

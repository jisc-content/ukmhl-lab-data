141 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. hand towards the coronal fossae, and on the other towards the root of the tooth. “ At first the dental substance appears to be composed of fibres variously curved, contiguous, and adherent at their convex sides, and is already hard and osseous (pstoi- dea.) In the apex itself these fibres spread equally in all directions, but towards the lateral parietes the longitudi- nal direction prevails ; whilst fibres whose course is sinu- ous, which are arranged contiguously in an uniform manner, and which leave at their concavities interstices between each other, proceed everywhere from the coronal apex to the root. Only the extremities of these are still soft; the re- maining parts harden in a very short time, unlike the substance of the enamel, in which the fibres, long after they have been deposited, appear soft and easily to be broken up. Whilst these are being formed, the prsefor- mative membrane also becomes of a stony hardness, except at the margin of the recently-formed dental substance, where it is soft and easily rent. The substance of the enamel begins to be formed at the same time with the dental substance. “ We have now to consider in a similar manner from its first commencement, the process of formation of the dental substance, with regard to its thickness. After a stratum of dental fibres has been deposited between the parenchyma of the dental germ and the praefor- mative membrane, which is now also ossified, the same process is continually going on from the external region towards the internal, the parenchyma of the dental germ supplying the material. This parenchyma decreases in proportion as the dental substance increases, and is with- drawn as it were into the dental cavity, which is gra- dually contracted. The convex curvatures of the dental

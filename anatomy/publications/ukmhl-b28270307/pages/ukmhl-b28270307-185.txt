163 I1I8T0HICAL INTRODUCTION. At the same time, the existence of a continual vital pro- cess in the tooth, as well as in the crystalline lens, cannot be denied, which, however, appears to be carried on with- out any constant exchange of solid matter, and must hence consist in a renovating circulation.” I have quoted this sentence again, because it characterises, more justly than any objections I could make, the imperfect state of the inquiry. The theory of the tubular system assumed to be true, has been with considerable ingenuity employed by a very emi- nent naturalist to explain that which takes place when teeth are stopped : it has been said that the mouths of the vessels which have been cut across in this operation de- posit a layer of calcareous matter under the stopping; but I believe that no facts bearing out this assertion have yet been observed ; and I cannot but think that the general character of the tooth, and the nature of the functions which it has to perform, are altogether incompatible with the existence of a system of open-mouthed vessels ready to pour out fluid of any kind to a greater or less extent. It is well known that even the least increment, or change of the material of the tooth under the stopping, renders that operation quite inefiectual, either by displacing the stopping, or by admitting the fluids of the mouth, and thus promoting decomposition beneath it. I may here remark, that the intelligent professor of Stockholm states that the crusta petrosa ceases at the neck of the tooth in many animals in which it is in fact continued over the whole extent of the enamel. The views of Muller on the crusta petrosa are very erroneous. “ This new substance, the cement, or crusta petrosa,” he says, “ seems to be merely a deposit from the salts of the saliva, and to be essentially the same as what is called the

137 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. rightly concluded, as the enamel-suhstance is formed there at a later period, that the enamel-organ continues to grow anew there, till the enamel-suhstance has been perfectly formed. In the molar teeth of the ruminantia, this organ appears, in part at least, to be connected with the capsule in such a manner that it seems to receive thence continually by proper vessels a sufficient supply of nou- rishment and of material for its increase, whilst, on the other hand, it disappears in other parts where its func- tions have been performed. This appears to obtain much more in those teeth, which (like those of swine and the rodentia) never cease to grow. “ Hitherto we have only treated of the dental germ in so far as was necessary towards the description of the dental follicle and enamel-organ: we now proceed to exa- mine more closely its organic structure and develope- ment, “ The dental germ is doubtless a product of the inter- nal wall of the dental capsule, seeing that the substance of its parenchyma is indissolubly connected with the cap- sular membrane, and there being the same origin, more- over, for the vessels and nerves of both. The doctrine which some have promulgated, that the dental germ is a continuation of the dental nerve itself evidently cannot be maintained ; although it cannot be denied that from the very commencement there exists an organic connexion with the nerves, as is the case in all parts in the interior developement of which nerves are formed. “ At first the dental germ presents a parenchyma con- sisting of almost uniform globular granules, in which nei- ther nerves nor vessels can be discovered. Subsequently vessels appear in it; but a long period must still elapse before any trace of nerves is visible in it. When the deve-

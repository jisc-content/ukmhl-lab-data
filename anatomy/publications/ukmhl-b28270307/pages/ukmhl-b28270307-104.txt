82 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Tlie cortical substance in the horse presents more large tubes than that of the ox; they are about ^ line p. m. in width, run horizontally from without inwards, and divide into branches. From these tubes, which may be compared, to a certain extent, with the medullary canals in osseous substance, innumerable minute branches are given off, which are as thick as the hairs in the finest nap. Between these are situated small, short, oval cells of about ros line p. M. in length. The tubes which leave the latter are so minute and so close together, that here, as in the sheep, such a group assumes the appearance of a vascular gland several times larger than the cell itself; Retzius succeed- ing in seeing these knots of tubes whilst the preparation was being varnished with turpentine. After having been thus steejied, the preparation was almost opaque. Imme- diately after it had been penetrated by the turpentine, the above-mentioned knots of tubes presented an appearance almost similar to that of the balls of the Conferva Aegagro- pila, but still one ran into the other. This appearance, how- ever, was not long kept up : the minute tubes were shortly filled with varnish, and then they disappeared altogether. A few minutes afterwards the large tubes and the cells (filled for the most part with varnish) were all that was to be seen. It was not till now that the small cells could be properly seen, and, from the appearance which they presented, no one would have supposed that any tubes or vessels opened into them. The cortical investment was very thin round the roots of the molar teeth; on the other hand, it was almost a line thick in some places round that part of the croAvn which is not surrounded by the gum. In young molar teeth, just before the period of extrusion, the enamel furrows were quite filled with cortical sub- stance, and a thick layer was already deposited on the

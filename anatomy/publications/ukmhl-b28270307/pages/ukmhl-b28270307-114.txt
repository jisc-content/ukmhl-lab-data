92 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. occupy a third of its extent from before backwards, and half of its width from side to side. It fills up the greater part of the dental cavity, even in teeth which are not old. An incisor tooth, which Retzins examined shortly before publishing his work, was only hollow for the reception of the pulp for two inches and a half from the alveolar ex- tremity. In this hollow portion are found a number of connected and generally cylindrical projections, resem- bling those of stalactites ; of these the most central ones are the longest; the more external ones are shorter, and the most external are shortest of all. These projections leave between them a number of interstices which were filled with pulp, so that it would be more proper to say that the whole group of projections lie embedded in the pulp of the tooth. If we examine these remarkable con- tents of the incisor tooth of the walrus with the aid of the microscope, we shall find that their structure bears great similarity to the internal structure of the substance of some cylindric bones. In a thin, transversely-cut, polished, and transparent section, it is found that every eyelet (of which the surface presents a number, from the size of a grain of mustard to that of a pea) represents, as it were, a jieculiar dental corpuscule, with a hole in its centre, which is analogous to the cavity of the pulp, or to the medullary canal in a transversely-cut section of a cylindrical bone. These holes are in many places full of a yellowish or reddish matter, different from the dental substance, and which is probably nothing else than the dried residue of a thready pulp. From the border of these orifices tubes run in all directions, as in a small tooth, but inasmuch as they are immediately surrounded by other similar formations, they shortly become, as it were, pressed together. Hence

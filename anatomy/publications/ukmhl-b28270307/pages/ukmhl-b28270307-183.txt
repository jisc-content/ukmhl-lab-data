HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 161 vessels containing a nonrisliing and sujiporting fluid.” In another part of his work, however, he says, “ with re- spect to the contents of the canals, I, as well as Professor M idler, have found that they consist of an inorganic or earthy substance, which appears white when viewed on a dark ground, hut which disappears when the preparation is placed in diluted muriatic acid. When the light falls into these canals, this matter is seen to he composed ap- parently of infinitely fine particles, adhering together in lumps. The greater or less number and distinctness of these lumps seem to depend on the degree in which the preparation has been penetrated by water, oil, or turpen- tine.” “ That the small osseous tubes and cells,” he afterwards adds, “ contain osseous earth, is seen from their whiteness.” And one of his followers states, that “ these tubes are chiefly rendered visible by means of their con- tents.” How a tube can be filled with osseous matter, and at the same time allow of the circulation of a “ nou- rishing and supporting fluid,” I cannot understand. It must not be forgotten, too, that Retzius allows “ that, in the tooth, no renovation of the material appears to take place.” Nor is it with respect to the more direct inductions drawn from the tubular system alone, that I must avow myself in some respects at issue with the ingenious and indus- trious Professor of Stockholm. “When the milk-teeth,” he says, “are examined just before they are about to be shed, they are found to present an appearance as if, from pressure of their permanent successors, they had wasted or been absorbed at their roots. The crown of the ad- vancing tooth appears to have pressed itself into the ex- tremity of the deciduous one. I have carefully ex- amined how this appearance is produced, and have come M

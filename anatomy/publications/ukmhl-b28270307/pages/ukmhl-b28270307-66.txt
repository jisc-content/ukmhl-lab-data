44 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. mie^' fifth edition, Leipsic, 1833, it is stated that the ivory, macerated in diluted muriatic acid, is converted into a white, half-transparent, smooth, shining cartilage, in which no fibres can be distinguished. The discovery of the lines or streaks above alluded to has been attributed to Schreger, but this is a mistake, they were mentioned by Duverney so early as 1639, and have been distinctly described by Sbmmering. In Cuvier’s “ Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles” (t. i. ji. 31,) he thus speaks of the structure of the ivory in the teeth of the elephant: “ Its tissue is neither cellular nor fibrous, but presents merely laminae encased one within an- other.” Wagner says of the ivory, that it presents “ a hard, shining, sometimes foliated or fibrous arrangement.” {Very. Anat. Leipsic, 1834, 1835.) Frederick Cuvier says, “ that the teeth of man, of monkeys, and of carnivo- rous animals, have an ivory of a silky appearance, which seems formed of fibres.” {Dents des Mammiferes. Dis- cours Prelim, p. 27). G. Cuvier describes the enamel as follows—{Sur les Ossemens Fossiles, tom. I. p. 34)—“ In the first place, the enamel is deposited on the surface of the substance called osseous by the internal membrane of the capsule, in the form of little fibres, or rather of little crystals, all perpendicular to this surface, and forming there at first a sort of velvet d hrins jins. When the capsule of the germ of a tooth is opened, tlie little mo- lecules of the future enamel are found adhering, but as yet very slightly, to the internal face of this capsule, and are easily detached from it. A part of them are even found swimming in the liquor interposed between the capsule and the germ.” The “ crusta petrosa” has been seldom mentioned by

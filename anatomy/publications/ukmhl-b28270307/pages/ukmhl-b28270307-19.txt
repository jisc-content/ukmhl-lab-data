Xlll PREFACE. myself made numerous observations and experiments on the same subjects, which I hope will be found to illustrate some of them, and to carry out others to very interesting and original conclusions. The importance of the study of Odontology in a zoo- logical and geological point of view, has induced me to form as complete a collection as possible of microscopic preparations of the teeth of the various classes, both living and extinct, of the animal kingdom. From these -I intend, in the course of the present work, when treating of the structure of the teeth, to make a selection calculated to serve as an index of the type of any animal. This part of the work I think will prove of much use to the Geologist, in enabling him to state to what class of ani- mal any tooth, or fragment of tooth, belongs. All must be fully aware of the importance which the study of the teeth assumes from a pathological point of view; but, generally speaking, many of the ma- ladies incident to them seem to be overlooked. I shall therefore attempt, in the course of this work, to describe fully their diseases, and to ascertain their source, with a view to the alleviation of suffering from symptoms, which often appear to be as anomalous as they are distressing.

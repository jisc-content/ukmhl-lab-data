139 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, hare, the sow, and the stag, especially in the molars, we constantly found stony masses. They were semi-trans- parent, for the most part oval, and rounded bodies, which were situated in the axis of the dental pulp towards its apex in irregular rows, never extending the whole length of the dental pulp, but only to a greater or less distance from the coronal extremity. Such examinations of the dental pulp are facilitated by the use of the compressor; but without its assistance the same results may be ob - tained, though with more trouble. “ In the dental germ, from the very first period of its formation, we invariably find the dental pulp together with a peculiar pellucid membrane without any characteristic organisation, which covers the surface of the pulji from the base to the apex. This we have denominated the prse- formative membrane, seeing that in it the formation of the dental substance commences, and that it always pre- cedes the latter. “ The parenchyma of the dental substance is com- posed, as we have already mentioned, of uniform, glo- bular granules, with no evident filaments of cellular tissue; by which circumstance it is best distinguished from the filamento-granular jiarenchyma of the enamel- pulp. Afterwards an abundance of nerves and vessels make their appearance. Vessels with several small stems communicating with each other enter into the in- terior of the pulp, partly proceed to the other surface, and there, principally in that part where the dental substance has begun to be formed, their branches are distributed, constituting a network of capillary vessels. But where the formation of the proper dental substance has not com- menced, and the prajformative membrane alone is found.

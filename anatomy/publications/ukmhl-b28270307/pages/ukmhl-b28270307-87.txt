65 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. oblong- cells filled with osseous earth, and branches from the tubes wound round about them. When the prepara- tion was laid for some time in turpentine-varnish, it be- came nearly transparent; the branches of the tubes were then rendered very incomplete, and Avere only apparent in some few places ; in the other parts, the main tubes ajipeared to terminate abruptly, and to give off no branches, or there were only visible the dull streaks AAdiich they had left behind them. In the lynx, the dog, and the hedge-hog, the cortical substance existed only as a thin layer at that part of the tooth Avhich was not invested with enamel, and it gra- dually diminished, and then terminated towards the border of the enamel. In an incisor tooth of an old dog, which had been much Avorn aAA^ay, it was very thick round the extremity of the root, but could only be traced to a very short distance. In the canine tooth of a full-grown lynx the cells were on the whole somewhat smaller, and also rounder than in the human subject. The fine calcareous tubes had generally almost straight trunks, which ran tolerably parallel to each other, and horizontally towards the sides of the teeth. The cortical substance was thickest at the end of the root, and closed the cavitaspulpce. Ne- vertheless, this cavity still existed, and contained a red pulp, which was continued as far as the apex of the tooth. In connexion with this, the cortical substance at the root was perforated by several canals, which in a converging direction were prolonged towards the end of the cavitas pulpee. The diameter of these canals was about ^ line, p. M. In a rugged molar tooth from the upper jaAV of the same animal, the small osseous tubes presented in several places similar parallel prolongations to those in the canine tooth ; in other places they were absent.

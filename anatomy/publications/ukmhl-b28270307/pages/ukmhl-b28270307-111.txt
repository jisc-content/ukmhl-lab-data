89 historical introduction. the whole course of the main tubes, short branches are given off, of which Retzius traced some to dilated extre- mities which resembled calcareous cells. These short branches, lying on both sides of the main tubes, proceed in part almost transversely and curved over the nearest interstices, and run partly as serpentine or winding lines towards the outer wall of the tooth. Only a few calca- reous cells were found in the interstices, and Retzius could discover no concentric rings. On the other hand, there were a number of very large, many-cornered cells, giving off numerous branches in the yellowish substance, which at the top of the tusk filled up the narrow cavity of the pulp. In the pig the cortical substance presented nearly the same structure as in the elephant. The cells were of the same size and appearance, but the parallel, stretched-out tubes were somewhat larger. In the pig, this substance jiroceeds a little beyond the border of the enamel; but on the remaining surface of the latter it could not be dis- covered. Here, as in the human subject, it only forms an investment of the roots of the teeth. Phoca Annellata.â€”Of the seal, Retzius examined lon- gitudinal and transverse sections, both of the incisor and molar teeth. On no part of them could he discover an enamel; but, on the other hand, he found considerable layers of cortical substance, particularly round the roots. Tlie greatest breadth of the main tubes was nk p.m. In these teeth, although they were taken from young ani- mals, the cavity of the pulp was almost closed. The con- tinuations of the main tubes, which occupied the most internal and most recently formed part of the dental bone, were winding, only slightly parallel to each other, and very irregularly curved. On tlie other hand, the more

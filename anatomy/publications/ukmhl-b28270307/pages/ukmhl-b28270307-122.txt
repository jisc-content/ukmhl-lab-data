100 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTIOX. rous layers of osseous cells are found in the whole length of the tooth, some of which are of larger size than others. They curve beautifully round in the crown, and follow most exactly the contour of the dental cavity. The largest layer of these cells is situated here, as in the teeth of most mammalia, in the external layer of the dental bone. It is j^artly these layers of osseous cells and partly parallel curvatures which form the numerous, delicate, parallel streaks which, under a simple magnifying glass, are visible in the transverse sections of the teeth of the crocodile. The inner side of the dental bone, or its cavity, appeared to be lined with a thin membrane, which protected it from contact with the reserve teeth, which this cavity also contains. In the crocodile also the cortical substance only coated the roots. Its cells were about 355 line p. m. broad, and for the most part circular and stellated, every stellated point being constituted by the entrance of a tube into a cell. The tubes scattered in every direction were so mi- nute, and formed such dark groups, that they could not be very evidently distinguished. Still Retzius could see that they did not run so parallel or regular as in the cor- tical substance of the animals whose teeth have been last described. Python JBivittatus.â€”In the teeth of thepy^/mw Retzius could discover neither enamel nor cortical s^ibstance ; the tubes of the dental bone are a little thicker than in the crocodile, and have an extremely faint curvature exter- nally and towards the root. Only in a few places, and after longer intervals, do they present a slight curve. Their distance from each other appears to be equal to the width of four or five of them. They do not divide, as in the above described, into branches, which in their

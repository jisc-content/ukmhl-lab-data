HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 96 at the end of the roots of the molar teeth : at tlie same place were seen a number of larger canals which entered into the cavity of the pulp, and probably belonged to blood-vessels. Delphinis DelpMs.—The teeth of the dolphin have a covering of enamel on that part which projects from the alveolus, and of cortical substance on that which the alveolus embraces. The cavity of the pulp was so filled with dental bone as to be reduced to a small canal, which was only present in that fourth of the length of the tooth nearest the root. This remaining portion of the cavity of the pulp was of little more than the thickness of a human hair, although the tooth examined was that of a young animal. In some teeth it was somewhat wider, but closed at both extremities : in others, it was altogether closed in its entire length. The tubes in the dental bone of this animal are somewhat smaller in their widest parts than those of the phoca and trichechus. The interstices were from three to four times broader than the diameter of a single tube. In the three- fourths of the tooth nearest the crown, they were parallel to each other; but in the fourth, nearest the root, they were almost irregularly winding. Some of the main tubes were extremely faintly undulating, in lengthy waves; others were not. In the coronal half of the tooth seen from both sides, they lay like S’s placed against eacli other, with their upper ends converging towards tlie crown ; but nearer the root they v^ere almost straight and transverse; and more interiorly still, in the root itself, their direction was the same as in the crown. Owing to their minuteness, and to the comparatively large interstices between them, the division of the main tubes, as also tlie giving off of the lateral branches, were seen with jiarticu-

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 75 of tlie Sheep, the main tubes present delicate undulating- curlings. In a section of an incisor tooth, which was cut from before backwards with the axis of the tooth, these main tubes presented three more considerable curvatures ; and between these were ramifications, differing in extent, which indicated different stages in the formation of the tooth. To the naked eye, too, the substance appeared as consisting of three layers, one lying before another. In the external layer the main tubes were straightest and most regular ; in the middle one, more curved, and in the internal one, most so. At the border, between the exter- nal and inner one, that is to say, immediately within the external large layer of tubes, was situated in the whole length of the tooth, except at the crown, a row of oval bodies which, on closer examination, were found to be small cavities filled with osseous earth, of which the largest was -k'" par. m. wide, and b'" long. The tubes wound close round the pariates of these cells, giving off several branches which also surrounded them, and some of which communicated with them. At the outer border of the preparation, or on the external surface of the tooth, ap- peared a number of thickset, calcareous, scale-like corpus- cules, between and in which the minute terminations of the tubular branches seemed to be lost. These corpus- cules, as well as the small calcigerous cavities just men- tioned, presented a white appearance when viewed on a dark ground. The tubes in the incisor teeth had evidently large branches from their commencement in the cavitas pulpcB; and, moreover, in the whole course of the main trunks, and of the principal branches, minute ramifica- tions were observable. The main tubes in the external third of their course were not half so thick as at their com-

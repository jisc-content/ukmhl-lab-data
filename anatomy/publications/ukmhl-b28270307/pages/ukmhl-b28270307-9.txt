TO ROBERT NASMYTH, ESQ. EDINBURGH. MY DEAR ROBERT, As there is no one more capable than yourself of fully appreciatingâ€™ the beauty and importance of the subjects discussed in the following pages, and none so likely to regard their defects with an indul- gent eye, it is to you that this work is dedicated by Your affectionate Brother, Alexander Nasmyth. London, Georyc Street, Hanover Square, May, 1839.

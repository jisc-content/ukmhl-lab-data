HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 151 It will be interesting, now that we have brought down our Historical Sketch to the present time, to inquire what at present is the real amount of our knowledge in the science of Odontology. The result of such an inquiry is unfortunately far less satisfactory than we might at first be led to anticipate from the number of works which have been published on this subject, and from the number of eminent men who have devoted their attention to it. The statements of writers are very much at variance, and not only do opinions difier, but the facts on which those opi- nions are based, we find everywhere described in a dif- ferent manner. How such discrepancies, as we here find in abundance, can have arisen in the simple field of ana- tomical description, it requires no little diligence and per- severance to explain. They have partly their origin, doubtless, in the infinite variety of aspects presented by the teeth in their constantly varying condition, and in the numerous stages of developement through which they pass. At one period, a particular membrane is highly vascular, and at another, in such a state of atrophy as to induce the observer to consider it as absent altogether. The arrangement of the parts appears at one time so confused, as at a superficial glance to seem destructive of the vital functions. Hence the anatomists, whose observations have been confined to the state of these organs at particular

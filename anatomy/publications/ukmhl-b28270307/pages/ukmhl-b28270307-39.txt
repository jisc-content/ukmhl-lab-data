IlISTOniCAL INTRODUCTION. 17 His details on many of the essential points connected with the physiology of the teeth seem to have passed entirely undigested through a great proportion of the works on this subject, which have been published from his time to this. In sketching the progress of surgical information in this particular department of science, we find a singular similarity between the opinions and even the diction ot those two eminent writers, Ambrose Pare and John Hunter. Though the latter wrote no less than two hun- dred years after the former, science in this intervening- period had made so little progress, that our great English physiologist seems to have had no more recent or better authority to refer to as a standard of facts than his anti- cpiated French predecessor; a circumstance which marks well how stationary the healing art must have been during the seventeenth and the greater part of the eighteenth century. The reader, doubtless, has already observed the simila- rity here alluded to ; but as the subject is curious, it may be well to institute a more formal comparison. Pare, in the 36th chap, of his 10th book, in a passage quoted above, (p. 5,) recommends a hot iron, or cotton dipped in oil of vitriol to be applied in cases of tooth-ache, in order to “ burn the nerve which is inserted into their roots.” Til is does not much differ from Mr. Hunter’s treatment, as we learn from the following passage : “ The nerve may be burned; that this may have the desired effect, it must be done to the very point of the fang.” Again, “ Either of the concentrated acids, such as those of vitriol, nitre, or sea-salt, introduced as far as possible, is capable of de- stroying its soft parts, which most probably are the seat of pain.” If the reader has any curiosity to trace further c

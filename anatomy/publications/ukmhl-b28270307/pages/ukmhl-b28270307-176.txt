154 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. a capsular covering. This covering, as it is seen to be continuous with the crusta petrosa, I consider to be ana- logous to it, as the latter has been found to invest the whole tooth in an enlarged state in many animals, and in a particularly interesting form in the orycteropus,* bra- dypus, walrus,t &c. In my collection are numerous prepa- rations of this covering on the teeth of man, on the inci- sor of the calf, and on the simple teeth of many other animals. I have detected it, indeed, on the teeth of so many animals, that I presume it will be found universal. By means of acid, I have removed it in the shape of a membrane from the surface of these teeth; and in delicate dry sections prepared in a 23eculiar manner, I have been enabled, with the microscope, to examine its structure. In man it forms a thin layer, of a darker colour than the enamel; it is continuous with the crusta petrosa which covers the fang, but differs from it in not always containing corjmscules. On the incisor of the calf this covering is very dis- tinct, and generally presents corpuscules. The extreme difficulty which is experienced in getting a fine section of a tooth without this membrane being removed in the process of reduction, is, probably, the cause of its having been overlooked by previous observers. It has been left to the sagacity of Raschkow, one of the most recent writers in this department, to explain what Herissant calls the temporary gum. Other writers have presumed that the tooth, before its extrusion, has a car- tilaginous investment, forming of course a considerable obstacle to its jirogress ; but the truth is, that this cover- ing, instead of being cartilaginous, is merely comjiosed of thickened epithelium.

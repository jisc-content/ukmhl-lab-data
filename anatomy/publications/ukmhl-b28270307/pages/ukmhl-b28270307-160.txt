HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 138 lopement of the tooth is much more advanced, and its vascularity has long been evident, true nervous filaments are also discovered. The same rule obtains here Avhich is manifest in all the parts of the foetus during- develope- ment. First is seen the formative parenchyma, which has no specific character, {indijferenti quce sic dicitur in- dole^ and which, though it contains the germs and seeds of nerves, presents as yet no true nerves themselves. “ Perhaps no part of the body exists where the ex- tremities of the nerves present so evident and beautiful an appearance as in the dental pulp. For displaying this, it is best to select the pulp of an adult tooth. We have examined it in the human subject, and in several of the rodentia and ruminantia. The nerves, after they have severally, or in bundles of several branches, entered the pulp of the tooth, recede more or less from each other ; and so in simple filaments, partly sej^arated and partly combined, proceed to the extreme apex of the crown, where again they divide by degrees into their simplest filaments, which, swelling like rows of beads, constitute the primitive series of variously interrui^ted nervous articuli, being accompanied in their course by a delicate cellular tissue, in order that they may not de- viate from a right line. At length, under the aj^ex, they again form a plexus, from which filaments are given off, terminating like ‘ penicilli’ at the extremity of the apex, where they are surrounded by a network of vessels. In the incisors of a man of about thirty, we found a great abundance of filaments in comparison with other parts of the body, and also with the teeth of other animals which we have examined; and hence may be deduced the great sensibility of the tooth, especially in man. “ It is worthy of mention, also, that in the teeth of the

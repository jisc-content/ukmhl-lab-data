HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, 53 and become joined with that part wliicli is subsequently jiroduced, and a continuous canal is at length completed. This process would seem to be effected in stages, in each of which one curvature is added to the preceding ones ; and hence we may conclude, that a certain undulating motion takes place on the surface of the pulp during the deposition of the dental bone. In general, and particularly in the teeth of old persons, it seems at fiiâ€™st as if these tubes did not divide or give off branches; they seem too, under the microscope, to be of the same diameter in nearly their whole extent; but this is not the case in reality : they all divide and give off branches, and their diameter diminishes towards their outer extremities in every case. From their commence- ment at the cavitas pulpse, for five-sixths of their course, they ajipear to be of the same diameter in fully-developed teeth ; and this diameter Retzius, with the aid of one of Frauenhof s micrometers, has ascertained to be ih Paris line, or about sfe of an English line. In their remaining course their diameter diminishes considerably, until they, as it were, disappear, or terminate in small, irregularly circular, scattered cells. The distance between the tubes at their middle equals about the breadth of three of them ; but at their commencement at the cavitas pulpse, they are nearer than this to each other. When very thin and transparent slices are examined on a clear day un- der a glass of 300-500 times magnifying power, it is found that tliese canals are main tubes, dividing dichotomically, and giving ofPin their entire course an infinite number of smaller subdividing branches, which partly help to fill up the spaces between the tubes, and partly cross over the latter, and are lost beyond them. These branches arc almost always easily perceptible in the milk-teeth. In the permanent teeth tbe branclies are found almost

158 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. that there are vessels passing from the pulp to the ivory. Fox dilates largely on their great analogy to bone, which he regards as jierfect except as to their density. He considers that their diseases also are similar to those of bone, and thinks, with Ambrose Pare, that they “ have their origin in inflammation.” G. Cuvier and Serres deny both the vitality of the teeth, and that their struc- ture is strictly speaking osseous. Serres, who also per- fectly expresses the opinion of Cuvier, speaks on this subject as follows :—“ Tout me porte a croire que le tissu propre des dents n’est pas le meme que le tissu propre du systeme osseuxand at p. 52 of his work he further says, “ N’y a point de nerf qui se distribue dans son tissu, puisqu’il est exhale, et, pour ainsi dire, inorganique (ana- tomiquenient parlant.)” M. Delabarre is the next author in chronological order, and we find him in direct opposition on these points to Cuvier and Serres. He is here a follower of Bichat, whose testimony is directly in favour of the vi- tality and osseous character of the teeth. Meckel is not to be classed on this subject with any of the preceding : his views resemble in some respects those of Cuvier, and in others those of Bichat. F. Cuvier inclines to think the analogy between the teeth, and hair or horn, more perfect than that between the former and bone. He describes the tooth as “ de- pourvue de vaisseaux et de nerfs, et privee de tout rap- port immediate et necessaire avec les autres organes. On the points under consideration, Kousseau is very un- decided; but he still states distinctly that vessels pass from the pulp into the ivory. Bell regards the teeth as osseous and vascular ; and states that there is a vascular communication kept up between the pulp and the ivory.

3 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. except in the horse, whose teeth are whitened by age. He considers that the difference betwixt bone and tooth consists in the circumstance, that the teeth increase in length during life, whilst the bones have a determinate limit to their growth. We may judge of the knowledge of these organs pos- sessed by Aret.2eus, from his assertion that the cause of the tooth-ache is only known to God. Pliny, who lived about four hundred years after Aristotle, does little more than repeat the doctrines of the latter, illustrated and em- bellished by various fables of his own. He mentions, however, the indestructibility of these organs, remarking that every other part of the bodies which were enclosed in the sarcophagi was destroyed, except the teeth. In the second century after Christ, Galen, who had profited by the labours of his predecessors, more particu- larly of the Alexandrians, wrote a better account of the teeth than any which had hitherto existed. He teaches that they are formed during the period of gestation; but that they remain hidden in the alveoli until birth; that the molars of the upper jaw have three roots, those of the lower only two; and that the canine teeth had also re- ceived the appellation of ocular, (o^QaX^t^ot,) because branches are sent to them of a nerve, which distributes others to the eye. He has a long chapter on their forms, their functions, and their evolution, and does not hesitate to pronounce them true bones: in ossium numero dentes hahendi sunt, etsi secus nonnulli sophistce arhitrentur. He maintains that the teeth feel, and that he has proved this on himself: quare utriusque doloris sensum. expertus, alium quidem gingivis, alium ipsius dentis substantia esse non duhito. n 2

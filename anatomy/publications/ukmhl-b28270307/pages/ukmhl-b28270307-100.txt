HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 78 giilar than in the sheep. They lay very close together ; approached the circular form ; and were about 7J3 line p. m. in diameter. It has been customary to consider the so called cement or cortical substance as only belonging to the crown of the teeth of ruminating animals, or to that portion which is invested with enamel. That this view is erroneous results from what has been stated respecting the cortical investment of the teeth of sheep; but it is still further refuted by an examination of the shapeless, tube- rous roots of certain ox-teeth. The deformity in these cases arises, as Retzius has found, from a too great deposit of cortical substance from the alveolus. Some teeth of this kind are preserved in the collections of the Carolinian Institution, and of one of these Retzius has given a draw- ing to illustrate the subject. (Plate A. 1. Fig. 10.) Equus Cahallus.â€”In sections of fully-developed, per- manent, incisor teeth of the Horse, cut from before back- wards, longitudinally to the cavitas pulpae, the tubes nearest the masticating surface, which were generally parallel with the axis of the tooth, were of the form of the letter f: more inferiorly in the crown the succeeding ones resembled an e ; and those which belonged to the extreme part of the root, a C, of which the convexity is turned towards the crown. In younger teeth which were not yet filled up in the crown, one or two curvatures were wanting. The undulations of the tubes were, so to say, more stretched out than in the human subject. At their inner extremity the diameter of the tubes varied between sfo'" and P. M. Their diameter diminishes considerably before they terminate in branches at the outer part of the tooth. In the middle of their course, their diameter ap- peared to be 3 less than at its commencement. In the first or inner half of their course the tubes lie so close

121 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. stantly preserved by the circulation of a fluid in their minute tubes and cells. “ The enamel presents a much more simple structure, being without sanguiferous or any especial vessels: its structure most resembles that of the crystalline lens. It also probably requires an organic fluid for its preser- vation, which, as I presume, is conducted to it by the tubes of the dental bone, permeating afterwards the mem- branous parietes which probably clothe the individual fibres. This substance is not found in all teeth, but appears in many cases in a rudimentary state, so to say, inasmuch as it is missed in the teeth which have not yet or have only just protruded — as in the anarrhichas lupus, gadus molva, and phoca annellata. Though I found no enamel on the teeth of the trichechus ros- marus, I still presume that a trace of it may be dis- covered on the crowns before they have been worn away. (In the halychserus griseus a complete though thin co- vering of enamel is found.) “ In some animals the enamel is formed not only within the folliculus dentis, but is also secreted during the whole of life by a small ring-like organ, which, near the bottom of the alveolus, surrounds the root of the tooth (in the hare, beaver, &c.) “ The cortical substance is found on the teeth of most mammalia, and is also met with on those of amphibia and fishes. It is everywhere distinguished by a predo- minant abundance of osseous cells, and by less extended, in general more minute, and often altogether irregular osseous tubes. It is formed in some animals (in the elephant, the horse, the ox, &c.,) as the outer covering of the enamel, particularly within the folliculus dentis before it is closed ; but in these animals also it is secreteil during the whole of life from the memlirane surroundimr

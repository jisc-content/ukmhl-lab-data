106 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, with the axis of the tooth; hut those which are nearest the root transversely to it, and so on. They divide at their commencement into bundles of larger and smaller branches, which enter into numerous reticular anasto- moses with each other, but which most externally give off very beautiful, close, jiarallel, generally straight tubes of about from to 5J00 p. m. in breadth : amongst the latter Retzius could discover neither branches, anastomoses, nor cells. This most external stratum of dental bone gives to the transverse sections of the tooth of the pike a pecu- liar and pretty appearance, and resembles, slightly mag- nified, a layer of enamel. It begins with an acutely angular attenuated border, near to the base of the toothy where the basilary part of the dental bone terminates, which, in recent teeth, is of a grayish, in dried of a yel- lowish colour; it increases somewhat in thickness nearer the apex, in which the minute tubular ramifications form, as it were, with the main trunks, the most beautiful den- dritic figures. This minutely tubular, external portion of the dental substance is of the purest white, and is also much harder and more compact than the interior of the dental bone. To judge by the hardness of its surface in dried teeth, Retzius would have concluded that it was in- vested with an extremely thin membrane of enamel; but he could not detect any with the microscope, although accurate authors have asserted that it is present on the teeth of the shark, Gadus Molva.â€”In the ling the fixed teeth sit like epiphyses on small processes, formed by a peculiarly modified dental substance, which presents, as it were, a transition from the osseous substance of the max- illa to that of the tooth. The teeth themselves are short, conical, and half transparent, and have at their apices

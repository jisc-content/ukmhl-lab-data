In disease of the tuber ischii, the pus is found in the line of the hamstrings, as these muscles arise from that bone. The course of the difl'erent forms of abscess depends on, or is determined by—(1) The tube or compartment of fascia in which it originally finds itself, or into wliich it has penetrated, as in psoas abscess. (2) Gravity, e.g., a psoas, or gluteal abscess reaching as low as the knee or even the heel; or which might have been a psoas abscess had the patient preserved the erect posture, becoming a luinhar from the patient resting chiefly on his back. (.3) The weakest parts of the fascia enclosing the abscess, or it may detach it from a part where it is least firmly adherent, as a psoas pass- ing into the pelvis posteriorly. (4) The presence of the fascial sheaths round arteries and veins through muscular layers—e.g., an abscess from hip disease passing to the buttock along the internal circumflex or obturator arteries, also lumbar and dorsal abscesses. (•5) The presence of like tubes near nerves, as a psoas passing into the pelvis along the lunibo-sacral cord. These various structures act as weak points, and predispose to the various paths that such abscesses often take.

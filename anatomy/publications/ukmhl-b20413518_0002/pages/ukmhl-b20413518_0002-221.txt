Surgical, Medical, a/id Operative. 205 Murmurs may be— 1. Exo-cardial {i.e., murmurs produced outside the heart), e.ij., friction sounds. Murmurs of this nature are known by three features — (a) By the double to-aud-fro rub; (&) it seems very superficial and near the ear; and (c) it is modified by pressure, or by stopping the respirations. Pressure of the stethoscope will intensify it. 2. Endo-cardial {i.e., murmurs produced inside the heart). They may be : — (a) Functional — associated with the various forms of anaemia and blood diseases. This is " curable heart disease," as it is not associated with any organic change, but is a " bruit of disparity of size," simply because, from the relaxed condition of the heart muscle, the openings are rather large for the valves. Fig. 171. Cause .OF Bruit de Diable. Internal Jugular Vein. Fascia. Cardiac tonics, as digitalis and strophantlius, will brace up the heart, make the valves fit, and make the murmurs Jess distinct. Murmurs of this kind are known by their widely-diffused character—at all the orifices—and also because they are always systolic in time. Like ordinary murihurs, they are propagated—thus the aortic one is heard over the great vessels of the neck. Accompanying this condition we also find the venous 1mm—the hummincc- top bruit, or the " hruit de Diahle." This is best heard on the right side, by listening over the sinus, or bulb, of the internal jugular vein, in the interval between tlie two heads of the sterno-clcido-mastoid, just above the sterno- clavicular articulation. It is a nmiinuniis nnirraur, but

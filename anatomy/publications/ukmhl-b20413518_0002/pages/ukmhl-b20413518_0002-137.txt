This nerve has already been seen in the middle ear, after Avhich it passes through the canal of HuGUiER and joins the lingual branch of the fifth at an acute angle between the two pterygoid muscles, and passes with that nerve to the tongue, forming the nerve of taste to the anterior two thirds; it is also secretory to the sublingual and the submaxillary glands. After the nerve has left the bone, it gives off—(a) The posterior auricular branch, which supplies the skin and posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle; (6) a branch supplying the stylo- hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric; and (c) branches from the pes, six in number, supplying the muscles of expression from the brow to the chin—including the buccinator. These muscles are situated around the cavities of the orbit, nose, and mouth. The six branches are—(1) The temporal, to the anterior belly of the occipito frontalis; (2) the malar, to the muscles round eye; (3) the ivfra-orhital, to the muscles about the nose; (4) the buccal, to the orbicularis oris and buccinator; (5) the supra-mctxillari/, to lower lip and chin; and (6) the infra-w.axillarij, to platysma, etc. The buccinator ("truvipeter's muscle") may receive twigs from the buccal branch of the third division of the fifth, although many anatomists regard this as a purely sensory nerve; it is a muscle of mastication as well as of expression; its expressive powers are fully brought out in playing the French horn, and other instruments of a similar nature, and in saying "Pooh/" It will be noticed therefore that the muscle that opens the eye is supplied by the third nerve (levator palpebrce), while the muscle that shuts the eye (orbicu- laris palpebrarum) is supplied by the facial. In superficial ulcerations of the cornea, as i^hlycteuular ophthalmia (strumous) where photophobia is so prominent a symptom, the orbicularis is spasmodically contracted (blepharospasm) by the reflex irrita- tion sot up ])y stimulation of the teruiina] filaments of the first

Mere inflammation of the cutaneous structures about the root of nail, with usually a drop of pus beneath the cutis. 2. In the flbrous tissue of the pulp, which is apt to spread to tlie i)eriosteum and cause necrosis of the terminal phalanx, from interference with the blood sup^jly, and the absence of the tendon sheath. 3. In the .sheath of tlie tendon or " true thecal abscess." Mr Duncan, however, teaches that tliis variety is, in all probability, non-existent as a primary afl'ection, though it may spread from the soft tissues or from the bone, and involve the sheath secondarily.

Applied Anatomy: 36 or the ascending pharyngeal hranch of the external carotid, be injured, there being nothing covering these vessels at this point except the pharyngeal aponeurosis and the superior constrictor of the pharynx. The adult should not require chloroform as the tonsils are not very sensitive, but children require it. The child is gagged and the tonsil removed either by the knife or guillotuie, only be very careful that blood does not pass into the larynx. The knife (Fig. 121) to use is a straight, probe-pointed bistoury, cutting to the point; it must be very sharp, so as not to necessi- tate sawing of the tonsil. The tonsil should not be " excised " when acutely inflamedâ€” (1) Because it is more painful; (2) it may bleed pretty freely; (3) and most important, it is brittle, and crumbles away in the grip of the vulsellum. Leave it till it is chronic, when the tissue is sufficiently tough to hold by the vulsellum. Mr Spence directs that the tonsil should be cut/?'o??i heloiv upioanls and inwards. The recesses on the inner surface of the tonsil are shaped like Florence flasks; hence, the narrow necks are apt to become blocked up, and then the wide part below forms a very suitable receptacle for fermen- tative changes, and for the growth of se^jtic and other organisms. Some believe that to this condition we must attribute tlie hypertrophied tonsils and the enlarged glands in the neck, and therefore propose that, instead of "excising" the tonsil, we should pass a blunt liook into the orifices and tear up tlie brittle tonsil substance, so as to destroy the narrow neck and secure Fig. 121, Knife for Excision OF Tonsil.

405 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. CHAPTER XLI. THE PELVIS. LITHOTOMY. The Lateral Operation.—The instruments required are as follows :— 1. Sounds of various kinds. The usual sound is a solid steel instruiuent, shaped like a catheter, but with a shorter curve, so that it may readily examine all parts of the bladder, esiDscially the part behind the prostate; the handle is flattened, and the point slightly bulbous. Sir Henry Thomson's sound is hollow^ and has a round handle; it is thus more easily managed during rotation, and may be used either to inject or draw off the contents of the bladder. In some cases the sound is so constructed that a " souudiug-board " can be attached to its end, in order to intensify tlie sound when a stone is struck. 2. An eight-ounce, or Higginson's, Syringe, with a catheter I'or injecting the bladder (unless the hollow sound be used), and a tube for washing out the bladder through the wound, after the operation, by a reversed current. 3. Staffs, as large as the urethra will admit, with as deep and wide grooves as possible on the left hand side ; the groove must stop half-an-inch from the point, and must not extend too far u]i the handle, lest urine escape during the operation. It may b(! straight (Key), or curved (Cjie.seI;UEn), or rectangular with a sliarp angle (Buchanan), or a rounded angle (Chiene). In cases of enlarged prostate, Chesef.den's staff is better than P.uchanan's, because, when the angle is in the membranous urethra, the point jnay not be in the bladder, and if the horizontal limb bo too long, it is very difficult to introduce. Professor Chienk's staff, with a specially long horizontal limb, however, can readily be introduced

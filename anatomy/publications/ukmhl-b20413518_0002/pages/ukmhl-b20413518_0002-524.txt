508 Applied Anatomy: extra-peritoncally. ([Jreat caru is re(|uircd in the treat- ment of adhesions, especially -when adherent to the abdominal or pelvic viscera. 5. AVhen the pedicle and adhesions are secured, and tlie tumour removed, search for the other ovary, and remove it if it he distinctly cystic. 6. Take out the sponges and examine them for signs of bleeding, carefully cleanse the peritoneum, for no serum or blood should be left in the abdomen. Searcli for bleeding points by means of the hand mirror or bull's-eye lamp, and secure them. liemove all forceps and sponges, and count them. 7. Place the flat sjjonge in the incision, and sew up the abdominal wound M'ith carbolised silk, or silk worm- gut, threaded to a needle at each end, introducing the needles from the peritoneal side, and avoiding the recti muscles. Pass all the sutures, remove the sponge, and then tighten them. Take care that they bring the divided edges of the parietal peritoneum into apposi- tion, otherwise ventral hernia may follow. 8. In simple cases, no drainage tube is required, as the peritoneum is sufficiently absorbent; in cases with strong and numerous adhesions, a glass drainage tube should be passed into the pouch of Douglas. The tube should have a broad flange of india-rubber, and over its end a sponge should be placed to soak up the serum. The patient is now carried back to bed, which must previously be Avarmed for her; she is to be covered mth light, warm clothing, and hot bottles placed around her, if necessary, and her knees supported by pillows. Little food is allowed for thirty-six hours, but hot water may be allowed ad llhitum, a little milk being added in the course of twenty-four hours; and later, beef-tea ]nay also be allowed. The bowels should be kept at rest, and she should take liquid food only, for at least a week. If the patient is restless after the operation, morphia may be given hypodermically at bedtime.

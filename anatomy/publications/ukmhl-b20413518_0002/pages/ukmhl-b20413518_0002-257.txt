241 Snygica/, Medical, and Operative. Apoplexy, a lesion in the First Division of the Trophic System ;— 1. There is a loss of motion and sensation on the opposite side of the body, as most of the fibres involved in the brain cross in the medulla, or cord, to tire other side. 2. There may be slight weakness of the same side from the presence of the direct or uncrossed pyramidal tract. 3. The paralysed muscles do not waste, as they are still con- nected with their trophic centres, and therefore their nutrition is unaffected. -1. At first the paralysed limb may bo warmer than its fellow, from the paralysis of the vaso-motor fibres Avhich are found in the crossed pyramidal tract, and are destroyed with its degeneration. 5. The crossed pyramidal, or tract of the opposite side of the cord, and the uncrossed, or direct, of the same side, degenerate, usually in about two months after the attack; this is evidenced by— G. Exaggerated tendon reflexes, as the inhibitory fibres for spinal reflex action descend in the degenerated tract, and are therefore destroyed; also by— 7. The rigidity (= the '■'■late, rigidity") of the paralysed limbs, the arm being held in the flexed position and the leg in the extended; also by the— S. Resistance to passive movement; the arm resists very power- fully all sudden attempts to straighten it, and the leg, to flex it. 9. The electrical reactions of the paralysed muscles are (|uite normal, as their trophic cells are unharmed. Ill some cases there is great pain and spasm of the muscles immediately after the attack (= tlic " earlij rigidity"); this shows that the nerve elements arc not destroyed, as they can still react to stimuli, and the prognosis is therefore good; late rigidity is a consequence and proof of destruction of the nerve elements, and tlie prognosis is therefore hopeless as regards cure of the condition.

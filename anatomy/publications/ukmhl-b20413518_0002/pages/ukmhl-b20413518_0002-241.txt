225 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. circumstances healing is impossible, as the granulations are unable to shoot out far enough. Three means are left open to us—(1) To force out the soft parts by increasing the pressure within the lungs, e.g., by playing the bagpipes or French horn;- (2) to "suck" out the soft parts (Duncan); and (3) allow the chest to fall in by cutting out parts of several ribs (Estlander). As regards the number to be excised, Dr Duncan advocates the removal of as many as eight ribs—from the third to the tenth inclusive. Eemove about three inches of the ribs in the centre of the space, but not quite so much at the upper and lower ends; the part removed should be something of this shape— After this operation the side falls in, the spine curves, and the cavity closes. THE MAMMA. The mammae extend from the third to the sixth or seventh ribs; they are enveloped in the superficial fascia of this region, which splits to enclose them, so that they are separated from the pectoral muscles by a thin layer of superficial fascia and loose con- nective tissue. In structure each inamma is a compound racemose gland, which is made up of from fifteen to twenty separate glands, the separate ducts from which all converge towards the nipple; beneath the areola each duct is dilated into an ampulla, which serves as a temporary reservoir for the milk; after this the ducts perforate the nipple at separate orifices. In position, the nipple corresponds to the fourth rib or the space below it; around the base of the nipple there are concentric circles of non-striped muscle, with other fibres, that radiate from the base to the apex. The fibrous capsule of the gland sends down septa between its separate lobules. The Arteries of the gland are derived from the long tlioracic, the external mammary, with branches from the inter- costal arteries over which the gland is placed, and corresponding branches from the internal mammary. The Nerves are exceedingly

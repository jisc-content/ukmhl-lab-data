Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 375 adhesion, the sac should be divided lougitudinally by two parallel iiicisiuus, one on each side of the cord, and the latter permitted to lie behind clear of the sac. The isolated sac should then be divided transversely about an inch above the testicle. The lower part is formed into a tunica vaginalis. The upper is pulled down as far as possible, and dealt with quite as the sac of an acij^uired hernia, additional precautions being necessary to clear the cord at the internal abdominal ring. It is freed of its connections, and placed as a pad on the abdominal aspect of the circumference of the internal ring (Fig. 200). On one occasion a separate tube was formed for the cord out of tlie sac, but this has not been repeated. In congenital inguinal hernia it has been advised that the testicle should be ablated. On two occasions this has been done â€”once Avhen the testicle was injured by a blow received prior to admission, and once when that organ was aM'ectcd by cystic degeneration. In both instances the absolute firmness and rigidity of the abdominal wall which resulted, taken along Avith tlie ease of the procedure, explains the desire for ablation of the testicle in congenital hernia evidenced by the advocates of this method.

^^86 Applied Anatomy'. which is relieved by cutting cautiously upwards and inwards,* so as to notch or divide both Gimbisrnat's and Hey's ligaments; if this cannot be accomplished by the extra-peritoneal method, the sac must be opened at the lomar part and the stricture divided from within it. The section is made in this direction not only for the reason given above, but for other reasons : thus, if the section were made outwards, the femoral vein is in danger; if upwards and out- wards, the epigastric artery; and if directly upwards, the spermatic Fig. 211.

The great danger is in the possible abnormal origin of the obturator artery, which may come in the Avay of the inward incision; try if possible to feel the pulsation before cutting, and if the pulsation be felt, blunt the edge of the knife, which will even then easily cut the tense fascia, but wUl displace the artery before it. The blood-vessels near the crural ring (Fig. 211) luider normal conditions are—(1) The femoral vein, to its outer side; (2) the deep epigastric artery, to the front and outer side of the * It be noticed that I have said to cut upwanls and inwards in both femoral and inguinal hernia; this simplifies matters, and is really the proper direction in both eases; but, of course, upwards \n inguinal, and inwards h\ femoral does perfectly well.

A strong wire is passed througli the cervix, in order to pull down the uterus towards the vulva; the labia are held aside, and the sides of the vagina separated if necessary. The Chief Steps of the operation (after Sir Spencer Wells) are— 1. Division and loosening, and pushing up, to the extent of a half to three-quarters of an inch of the vaginal mucous membrane, behind, in front, and all roiuid the cervix. 2. Pushing upwards, or separation of the bladder and ureters from the neck and anterior surface of the body of the uterus, as in the abdominal method, but the peritoneum is not cut into. 3. Opening of Douglas's pouch and the introduction of a sponge to keejj ujj the small intestines. Two fingers of the left hand may also be introduced and passed over the fundus, into the interval between the uterus and the bladder, and an incision then made from the front of the cervix down upon the fingers, dividing the peritoneum anteriorly. In this way the uterus is now I'reed in front and behind. 4. The next step is to secure the uterine arteiie.s on both sides, by ligature or by the pressure foi'ceps. Each broad ligament may be ligatured in two parts, and an additional ligature jjut round the Avhole for safety. 5. A'ext divide the broad ligaments and other attachments; remove the uterus and examine the pedicles for bleed- ing points, and secure them at once. 6. Remove the sponges and brhig the pedicles into tlie wound in the roof of the vagina, and fix in position by suture, and introduce a T-shaped drainage tube between the pedicles into the peritoneal cavity. Lastly, arrange the ligature threads or forceps, and plug tlie vagina loosely with iodoform gauze. Sir Spencer AVells lays great stress upon two points in this operation—(1) The extreme care necessary in the separation of the bladder and ureters from the uterus; neither should be

The gangliated cords of the sympathetic are not in the mediastinum. The Roots of the Lung. — Each root consists of a bronchus, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, bronchial vessels anil glands, anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses of nerves, and the connective tissue through and over all. The relations of the bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins are really the same on both sides, only that there is an extra bronchus (the epiurterkd) on the right side. From above downwards, therefore, the order is— Ilvjhl Side— Lrft Side— Bronchus. Arter)'. Artery. JSronclnis. Bionchns. Veius. Ychis. From before backwards the order on the two sides has always been regarded as the same-—viz., veins, artery, bronchus. Relations of the Roots of the Lungs.—The relations Avill best be .shown by a small table. In the table it will be observed that five are the same on both sides, and that three are different:— Right Root. 1. Anterior j'almoiiiuy plexus in front. 2.

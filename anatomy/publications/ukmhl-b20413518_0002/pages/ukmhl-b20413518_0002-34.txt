Applied Anatomy: 18 also, that irritation of this nerve will cause reflex spasm of the glottis and death from asphyxia—e.g., a foreign hody in one of the ventricles. The inferior, or recurrent, branch is principally motor, and supplies the intrinsic muscles not supplied by the superior. Pressure upon the trunk of this nerve first causes sjKisiii of the muscles of the larynx, due to irritation of the nerve—later, paralysis, from destruction of the nerve, or from the intense pressure. The siqm-ior larijngeals lie behind the internal carotid artery; the rigid recurrent laryngeal hooks round the first part of the subclavian, lying on the apex of the pleura and lung, and farther up, lies behind the common carotid and the inferior thyroid arteries; the left recurrent laryngeal hooks round the arch of the aorta, and then, like the right, ascends by the side of the trachea in the groove between it and the oesophagus. Subclavian, aortic, or carotid aneurism, and malignant disease of the Avails of the oesophagus, therefore, may press on and mvolvc the recurrent nerves, and may cause death from spasm of the glottis, as well as -by direct pressure on the trachea. The left nerve is more frequently paralysed than the right, probably from its longer course, and its relation to the arch of the aorta. With the Laryngoscope the following structures can be seen:— The base of the tongue, the upper surface of the epiglottis with its lip and cushion, the glosso-epiglottidean folds or ligaments, the arytenoid cartilages, the true and the false vocal cords, the ventricles of the larynx, the aryteno-epiglottidean folds on each side, with two rounded elevations, corresponding to the cartilages of Wrisberg and Santorini ; and sometimes, in deep inspiration, one may even see the rings and bifurcation of the trache;i. Results of Paralysis.—The superior laryngeal: this causes anassthesia of the larynx and epiglottis, so that particles of food can readily enter the larynx; the vocal cords cannot be made tense, so that the voice is hoarse and deep, and the cords may be seen sAvinging loose. The paralysis may be caused by the pressure of tumours and aneurisms, but is usually a sequel to diphtheria, or a symptom of bulbar paralysis. The inferior or recurrent laryngeal may also l)c paralysed Ijy the pressure of tumours in the posterior mediastinum and

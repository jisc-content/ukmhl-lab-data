496 Applied Anatomy: Phimosis.—In this condition there is usually a long foreskin, the orifice of which is so contracted that it prevents exposure of the glans, and leads to the retention of the sebaceous secretion (smegma preputii, secreted by the glands of Tyson), setting up local irritation and inflammation, and may even prevent the patient making water properly. The condition may be congenital, or acquired, usually the result of inflammation or disease. There are two forms—(1) Where the prepuce is redundant—for this circumcise; and (2) where it is not redundant—for this snip the muco-cutaneous junction all round till the prepuce can be retracted, or else dilate the orifice with a glove stretcher.

The Contracted Ring that prevents the Prepuce from being pulled back; it is also the point that should be seized by the forceps in cii'cumeisiou. Circumcision is performed for the relief of the above con- ditions. In performing the operation, bear in mind what has already been stated about the relations of the cutaneous and mucous i^arts of the prepuce. A tape, or special clamp, or an elastic tourniquet is passed tightly round the root of the penis to control the hasmorrhage during the operation. The prepuce is then pulled backwards slightly, till the constricting ring is visible, which is to be seized by a pair of catch forceps, and then tlie prepuce pulled forwards over the end of the glans; this ensures the removal of the tight ring which is the cause of the condition, and the redundant prepuce gradually clipped off.

141 Surg-ica/, Medical, ciiid Operative. The Costo-Coracoid Membrane.—This is a process of tlie deep cervical fascia situated under the clavicular head of the great l^ectoral; externally it is attached to the coracoid process of the scapula, internally to the first rib, and between these two points to the under surface of the clavicle, in a double fold, one in front and one behind, forming the sheath of the subclavius muscle. Immediately below tlie subclavius it thins considerably, forming a Fig. 153. Fascia about Axilla- crescentic margin, which is sometimes called the " costo-coracoid ligament." The fascia is continuous—above, with the deep cervi- cal fascia; on the under surface, with the sheath of the axillary vessels; and below, it joins the sheath of the pectoralis minor (Fig. 153). It encloses the subclavius muscle, and the following structures pierce it:—(1) The cephahc vein; (2) the external anterior thoracic nerve; (3) the thoracic axis, or the acroraio- thoracic artery; (4) the superior thoracic artery (if present); and (5) corresponding veins.

ylpplied Anatomy: CHAPTER XXXIII. THE LOWER EXTREMITY ( Coidiuned ). POPLITEAL SPACE. Tuis i.s ;i diaiuoiul-sliajDecl cavity situated at tiic Ijack of the knee joint. Boundaries. — (1) The external superior — the biceps; {'!) tlic internal superior — tlie semi - tendinosus, semi - mem- branosus, and, furtlier back, the gracilis and sartorius; (3) the external inferior—tlic outer head of the gastrocnemius and tlie plantaris; and (4) the internal inferior — the inner head of the gastrocnemius. Tire roof is formed by the dense popliteal fascia; and the floor is formed by the popliteal surface (trigone) of the femui', the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and the popliteus, covered by its fascia. Contents.—(1) The small sciatic nerve; (2) the internal and external popliteal nerves, and their branches; (3) the popliteal artery, with its branches; (4) the popliteal vein, with its tributaries, especially the external or short saphena vein; (5) the articular braucli of the obturator nerve; (6) fat and areolar tissue; and (7) four or five lymphatic glands, deeply placed beside the great vessels. It is important to note that there is a layer of fatty tissue, of some thickness, interi)osed between the artery and the trigone of the femur, but that the vessel lies close to the tibia. This is probably the reason Avliy trigone-iiecrosis so rarely causes ulceration of the pojiliteal artery. Abscess in the Popliteal Space may arise as a result of inflammation of the lymphatic glands, due to poisoned sores on the outer aspect of the foot; the pus iu this case cannot reach the surface through the dense fascia forming the roof of the sjjace, and it therefore tends to burrow in other directions. It may pass up

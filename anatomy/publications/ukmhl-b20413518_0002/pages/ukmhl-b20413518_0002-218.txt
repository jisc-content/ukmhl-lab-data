Applied Anatomy: 202 back from the left ventricle to the left auricle, from the left auricle to the lungs, from the lungs through the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, and from this, through the tricuspid opening, to the right auricle, and from thence to the systemic veins, especially the inferior vena cava. The Secondary Results of this condition are numerous. The Cavities of the Heart will, if the patient have sufficient vitality, become hypertrophied, and " compensation " will thus be produced; but if his vitality be low, they will dilate, " compensation" will not be produced, or, if present, will fail. The Lujigs suffer from congestion, oedema, bronchitis, and, finally, "brown induration": the pressure in the Pulmonary Artery is increased, and hence there is accentuation of the second sound in the pulmonary area: the Right Ventricle dilates, the tricuspid valve becomes incompetent, and hence we have pulsation in the external jugular vein in the neck. This Venous Pulse is peculiar; it is not the compact-like throb of an arterial jjulse, but is undulating and wavy in character, and though very easUy seen, yet, when the finger is placed upon it, cannot be felt. When the vein is emptied, by drawing the thumb upwards over its course, it will be observed to fill from below upwards at each beat of the heart. This is the characteristic diagnostic point of tricuspid regurgitation. The Systemic Veins next suffer, espe- cially the inferior vena cava; the veins are over-filled, and the various organs and tissues passively congested: the Liver undergoes "cyanotic atrophy"—a mechanical atrophy of the liver cells, from pressure of the over-full capillaries—the change begins in the centre of the lobule, in the region of the hepatic vein: the Stomach and the Intestines are passively congested, and are unable, there- fore, to do their work properly—hence the indigestion; the Sjileen and Kidney are passively congested, and become indurated, or cirrhosed: the Blood deteriorates: the Vessels in the subcutaneous cellular tissue at the most dependent parts, as the feet and anldes, are over - distended, fluid exudes beyond the capacity of tlae lymphatics to remove—hence, the dropsy of the cellular tissue, or anasarca, Avhich is shoAvn by the part " pitting on pressure." This dropsy is always worst in the evening, and disappears when the patient lies in bed. Compare this with Renal Dropsy, which first shows itself as a puffiness under the lower eyelid, and is worst in the morning; and Avith Hepatic Dropsy, from pressure on the

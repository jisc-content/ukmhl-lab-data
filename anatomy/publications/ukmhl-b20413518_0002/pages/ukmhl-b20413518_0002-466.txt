450 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER XLIIL THE PELVIS — f Gontinued). THE TESTICLE. The Testicle: its Coverings.—The testicle lies obliquely in the scrotum, suspended by the spermatic cord and its coverings. It is oval in shape, and its front, sides, upper and lower ends, are smooth; but the posterior part, where the spermatic cord is attached, and where the vessels enter and leave, is not smooth, and it is not covered by the serous membrane (visceral layer of the Fig. 221. Section of Testicle. Mediastinum Testis -- Cavity of Tunica Vaginalis Trabeculie from Mediastinum— tunica vaginalis). The gland itself is enclosed in a strong capsule —the tunica alhuginea—vilaich. is a dense, fibrous membrane. At the posterior part this membrane is reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum, called the mediastinum testis, or corpus Higlmuriamim. From the front and sides of this septum, trabeculte are given ofl", which pass to be attached to the inner surface of the tunica albuginea. In the

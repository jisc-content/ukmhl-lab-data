Applied Anatomy: 70 The Cortical supply consists of the terminal branches of the cere- bral arteries, which divide into a very fine plexns in tlie pia mater, and then enter the grey matter as long capillaries, each supplying a special area. It will be seen, therefore, that the cerebral arteries are " terminal," and when plugged an " infarct " is produced, just as in the kidney and spleen. Fig. 143. Cerebral Emboli. Extenial Carotid.

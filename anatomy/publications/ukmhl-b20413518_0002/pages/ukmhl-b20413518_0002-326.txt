Applied Anatomy: 310 In tlie first method, a median laparotomy is first performed, and the diseased segment of tlio gut is pulled out at the wound; the woimd is then plugged with clean flat sponges, to prevent the entrance of fseees into the abdomen from the segment to be excised, and also to prevent the protrusion of more bowel. The bowel must now be occluded on each side of the part to be excised by some form of clamp; the one invented and nsed by Fig. 182. Lembert's Suture—Surface View.

Mr Treves has its compressing surfaces covered with iiulia- rubber, and it is so made that the two ends can slide along iron rods, so as to approximate the ends of the divided gut before the introduction of the sutures. The necessary amount of gut is then removed with the scissors, and a V- shaped piece of the mesentery removed, and all the bleeding vessels ligatured. Tlie two parts

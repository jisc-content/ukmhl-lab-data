Destruction of the spur or eperon. 2. Closure of the fistula. The " spur" is formed by the posterior part of the circumference of the two ends of the bowel. Their walls, supported one against another, constitute a sort of valvular partition, which prevents tlie free passage of their contents from the upper to the lower end of the gut (Fig. 238).

Its rapid removal by the knife or scissors, or more slowly by ligature, is apt to open into the peritoneal cavity and set up latal septic peritonitis. To avoid this, Dupuytren uses the enterotome. It is composed of two blades, which can be introduced separately— one into the upper, and the other into the lower end of the bowel. Tlie blades are then joined together, as in the case of the mid- wifery forceps, and firmly pressed together by means of a screw.

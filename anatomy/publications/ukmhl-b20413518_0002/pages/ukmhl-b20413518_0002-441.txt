Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 425 3. Oil and introduce the rectal elastic bag, and fill it with warm horacic lotion; do not use too great force, lest the wall of the rectum be ruptured; eight to twelve ounces in the adult, and three to four ounces in the child, is the quantity usually required. This bag raises the floor of the bladder almost to the level of the upper edge of the pubes, so that it comes well within the reach of the operator. â– i. Make an incision two and a half or three inclies long in the linea alba, and partly over the pubes ; this divides skin and fat, and exposes the linea alba. 5. Open the linea alba near the pubes, between the pyra- midales, and, if thought necessary, divide the rest of the linea on Spence's hernia director; next divide the fascia transversalis in a similar manner. 6. Hold the sides of the wound apart by broad cojjper spatuliG, and then, wdth the handle of the knife and finger, tease through the loose connective tissue and fat, and define the posterior surface of the pubes, the wall of the bladder, and the peritoneal reflection, which should be pushed up. 7. Having recognised tlie bladder by its muscular fibres, pass two silk stitches, one on each side of the middle line, through its muscular coat only, so as to hold it forwards and prevent its collapse and retraction behind the pubes Avhen opened : two sharp hooks may be used instead of stitches. 8. Having thus secured the bladder, plunge a scalpel into it, with its edge towards the pubic bone, about an inch and a half above the pubes, quickly withdraw the knife, and insert a finger to plug the opening and ascertain the size of the stone. 9. The opening is then to be dilated sufficiently with the finger, the forcep.s introduced, and the atone withdrawn. LITHOTRITY. In this operation the stone is crushed in the bladder, and the pulverised fragments expelled or extracted through the urethrix.

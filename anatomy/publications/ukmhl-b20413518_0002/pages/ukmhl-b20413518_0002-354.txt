338 Applied Anatomy: often containing scales of cliolesterine. The specific gravity varies from 1010 to 1040, or even more. The viscidity is said to be due to the paralbumen of Scheuer ; this substance differs from ordinary albumen, in that it does not coagulate when boded witli a small quantity of acetic acid. It is stated that this form of albumen is never present in ascitic fluid. Ascitic fluid, on the other hand, often deposits fibrin, but fibrm is not a constituent of ovarian fluid. Should a fluid, therefoi'e, contain paralbumen and deposit fibrin, it is probably due to an ovarian cyst bursting into the jDeritoneal cavity. In some cases it is impossible to distiuguish between ovarian and ascitic fluid. It is stated that special cells are found in ovarian fluid. The cell is about the size of a pus cell, generally round, delicate and transparent, full of granules, hut has no nucleus. Acetic acid increases the transparency of the cell and makes its granules more evident. In cases of malignant disease, large pear-shajjed, round or oval cells are found. Tliese cells contain granular material, with one or several large clear nuclei, with nucleoli and a number of transj^areut globules or vacuoles. Ascitic fluid is a yellowish serous liquid, closely resembling slightly diluted liquor sanguinis, from Avhich, indeed, it is dii'ectly derived. It is a clear yellow, or greenish-yellow, alkaline fluid, with a specific gravity varying from 1020 to 1035. It consists of water, salts, albumen, and the elements of fibrin, and hence, on standing, may coagulate, depositing fibrin; indeed, in some cases it may be so thick and viscid, from coagulated matter, as to be incapable of flowing through the cannula.

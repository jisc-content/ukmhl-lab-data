Applied Anatomy: 204 with tlie mesenteric vessels. The glands of the large grit are much less nnuierous. The lymphatic vessels of the small gut are called lacteals; they pass through the mesenteric glands and terminate in the thoracic duct. The glands at the lower end of the small gut are enlarged in tyjihoid fever. The lymphatics of the descending colon and rectum pass to the lumJ>ar glands. In tabes mesenterica, which consists of tuliercular inflammation of the mesenteric glands, with subsequent caseation, suppni'ation, or calcification, the func- tions of the glands are destroyed, and, therefore, the substances which the lacteals should absorb (the fatty matters) are lost to nutrition. Hence the emaciation, the enlarged and tender abdomen, the drawing up of the legs, the voracious appetite, as the child always feels hungry, and the diarrhcoa, from the fatty matters passed per rectum, as well as the tubercular inflammation of the mucous membrane of the gut.

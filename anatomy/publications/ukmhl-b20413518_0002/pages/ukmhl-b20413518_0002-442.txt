42G Applied A iia/oiiiy : The instinimeut used for this purpose is called a Tifhafriie. The operation was formerly performed at several sittings, and the shorter these sittings were the better, because the long continued contact of instruments with the mucous membrane of the bladder is apt to produce cystitis, leading to pyasmia, or even death. At tlie first sitting the stone was simply crushed and the fragments were left to be pulverised and extracted at subsequent sittings. ]!ut the crushed stone thus left is apt to produce great irritation in the mucous membrane of the bladder, and, unless care be taken in the treatment of the patient between the sittings, small fragments of the stone are apt to be driven into the neck of the bladder, or even into the urethra, causing great pain and injury to the tissues; and, even with the greatest care in the fiwd explnmtion, small fragments were apt to be left, which formed the nuclei of subsequent calculi. About the year 1882 a new operation was introduced, called Litholapaxy, by Bigelow, who was the first to plan and carry out the operation. For its performance the following special instruments are required—(1) A lithotrite, (2) a large evacuation catheter, and (3) an aspirating siiDhou. The following advantages were claimed by Bigelow for this operation—(1) The stone is crushed and removed at a single sitting, so that the bladder is thus freed from the irritation caused by small fragments of stone retained in its interior for a lengthened period, and the urethra is also freed from the irritation of their possible f)assage between the sittings (as in lithotrity); and further, the fragments are completely removed, so that none are left to form the nuclei of subsequent calculi; (2) the lock of the Utliotrite whicb he used was more easily closed than in the ordinary lithotrite, being shut by a simple turn of the wrist M'ithout dis- placing the hands, and the blades are so formed that they allow of the easy escape of detritus, so that laceration of the neck of the bladder is prevented in the withdrawal of the instrument; and (3) the stone need not be pnlrerised, because (4) the catheter used is very large, its inventor taking advantage of the fact that the urethra admits of great dilatation. Tliis is the operation that is always performed now, under the name of Lithotrity'at a single sitting—the old lithotrity

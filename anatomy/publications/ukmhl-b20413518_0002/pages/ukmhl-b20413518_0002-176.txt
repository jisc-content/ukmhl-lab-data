160 Applied Anatomy: The Cribriform Fascia closes up the saphenous "opening," and is pierced by a large number of lymphatic A'essels (hence its cribriform appearance); it is also pierced by the long saphenous vein. This is the longest vein in the body; it passes tlirougli the cribriform fascia, at the lower end of the saphenous opening, just above the inferior cornu. Just before it passes through, it is joined, usually as a common trunk, by the veins corresponding to the three superficial branches of the femoral artery. At this point the vein is frequently the subject of the diseased condition known as Varix ; some believe that this is due to the vein being semi- strangulated by turning too sharply over the dense fascia forming the inferior cornn of the saphenous opening, and to relieve the condition and cure the disease, suggest that the fascia should be divided. The floor of the triangle is formed by (beginning at the outer side) the iliacus, psoas, pectineus, sometimes part of adductor brevis, and adductor longas muscles. Contents.—(1) The femoral sheath; (2) the femoral artery, giving off the cutaneous branches and the profunda \ (3) the femoral vein ■with its tributaries, the long saphena and profunda veins; (4) the anterior crural nerve and its branches; (5) the external cutaneous nerve; (6) the crural branch of genito-crural and ilio-inguinal nerves j (7) the superficial division of the obturator nerve; and (8) fat, with deep lymjahatic glands and vessels. Fluctuating Swellings in this region of the groin are numerous, as—(1) Localised chronic abscess; (2) it may come from a peri- nephritic abscess; (3) on the right side, from a pericecal abscess; (4) iliac abscess under the fascia, from disease of the bones, or above it; (5) pelvic abscess, in hip disease or from cellulitis; (G) glandular abscesses ; (7) from an empyema; (8) serous or hydatid cysts; (9) a hernia with fluid in the sac; and (10) cj'sts or bursal collections in connection with the hip joint, e.g.^ in Charcot's disease, and sometimes in chronic rheumatic arthritis. Structures beneath the Gluteus Maximus Muscle.—(1) Part of gluteus medius; (2) superficial branch of the gluteal artery and superior gluteal nerve; (3) pyriformis muscle; (4) lower border of gluteus minimus; (5) sciatic vessels; (G) great and small sciatic nerves; (7) pudic vessels and nerve; (8) nerve to the obturator internus, which also supplies the gemellus superior; (9) nerve to

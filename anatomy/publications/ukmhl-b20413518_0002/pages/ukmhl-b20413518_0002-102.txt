Applied Anatomy: 8G TREPHINING. This operation should not be performed over the course of the sinuses, nor in situations likely to wound the middle meningeal artery. A line drawn over the head, from the root of the nose to the occijDital protuberance, indicates the course of the superior longitudinal sinus; and the posterior two thirds of another line, drawn from the same protuberance to the external auditory meatus, indicates the course of the horizontal portion of the lateral sinus ; and about the middle of this line the pulsations of the occipital artery may be felt (Holden). The position of the middle meningeal artery must also be avoided, unless trephining in this situation be indicated for special reasons (see vol. i., page 103). Fig. 148. Hey's Saw. Properly speaking, " trephining " should only be applied to cases where a complete circle of bone is removed from the skull by the trephine, though it is usual to speak of elevating depressed fragments, removing small angles of bone with Hey's saAV (Fig. 148), etc., as " trephining." " Trepanning " is an operation seldom, if ever, performed now. In this the bone was removed by a trephine head, worked in the same way as a carpenter's boring brace. Instruments required.â€”Scalpel, trephines, dissecting forceps, catch forceps, a brush to clear aAvay the sawdust, director, fine hypodermic syringe or Graefe's cataract knife, a (pill, IIev's saw, elevator, " lenticular," raspatory, sponges, ordinary and silver drainage tubes, etc.

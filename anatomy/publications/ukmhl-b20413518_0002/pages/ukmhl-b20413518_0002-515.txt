Surgical^ Medical, and Operative. 499 The Structures divided are—(1) Skin; (2) just under the skin on the dorsum, the central vein with an artery, and a nerve on each side; (:T) the corpora cavernosa with the pectiniform septum, with an artery to each corpus, and one to the septum; and (4) the corpus spongiosum. There are therefore five arteries to ligature— the two dorsal arteries, one for each corpus cavernosum, and one in the septum (see Fig. 229). Fig. 232. Amputation of Penis.—First Stage.

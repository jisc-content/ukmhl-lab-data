Motor Areas.—The motor areas are situated immediately in front of and behind the Fissure of Rolando. Thi.s fissure separates the frontal from the parietal lobe (Pig. 145), and niiis up not quite parallel with the coronal suture, being from one and a half to two inches behind it at the vertex, but only a little more than an inch at its lower end. According to Thane, the upper end of the fissure of Eolando is placed half an inch bcliind a jjoint mid-\vay between the root of the nose and the external occipital protuberance; its lower end, for all practical purposes, is situated about two and a quarter inches behind the external angular process of the frontal boire. The fissure passes dowuAvards and for^^•ards for about three inches and three - quarters, and, according to Professor Haee, at an angle of sixty-seven degrees to the sagittal suture.

192 Applied Anatomy: cutaneous, those passiug under the external; the posterior tibial, those passing under the internal; and tlie muscles forming the tendo achillis, by tlie internal popliteal (Fig. 167). Fig. 167. Section of Leg.—(From Cukninuham.) a Diagram to sliow Ike osteo-fascjial coiupartiueiits of the leg. I. Tibia, /. Pibula; both of wliicli arc seen in transverse section. The general aponeurotic covering of the leg is represented fusing with the periosteum over tlie subcutaneous or inner surface of the tibia. ffi. Interosseous Membrane. h. The Inter-muscular Septum which intervenes between the Peroneal Muscles and the Extensor Longus Digitorum. c. Tlic Septum between the Peroneal Muscles and the Flexor Longus ITallucis and Soleus. Tlie three ostco-fascial compartments are mapped out and their contents indicated. The posterior compartment is subdivided into two parts by the deep laj'er of fascia (rf). As is usual in the case of muscles contained within such com- partments, each group lias its own distinctive nerve-supply. Synovial Membranes of the Foot and Ankle Joint. — They are seven in number—(1) One at the ankle joint proper; (2) one in the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; (3) o}ie in the calcaneo-talo-scaphoid articulation \ (4) one between the os calcis

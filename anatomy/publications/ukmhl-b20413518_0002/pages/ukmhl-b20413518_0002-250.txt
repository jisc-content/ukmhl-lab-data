234 Applied Anatomy: The Motor Strands are the direct or uncrossed pyramidal tract, aud the crossed pyramidal tract (Fig. 172). The direct trad (columu of Tueck) is situated in the anterior column, close to the anterior median fissure; it is called uncrossed, because the fibres forming it, coming from the motor centres of the cortex, have not crossed with the rest of the motor fibres in the medulla. The crossed tract is situated in the lateral column, close to the posterior cornu, but does not quite reach the surface of the cord; the fibres of this tract have crossed in the medulla, so that they belong to the opposite side of the brain. The motor fibres, therefore, from one side of the Fig. 172. Section of Cord. Jfusclo , Jfotor Fibi o I I.iddcn and Gower's Tract (Sensory) Slultiiiolar Nerve Cell Crossed PjTiimidal Tract (Motor)...

'brain, go partly down the same side of the cord, though the greater number cross in the medulla aud go down the opposite side; both these tracts are pyramidal in shape, with the base at the medulla, as the fibres are constantly leaving the original bundle. The Sensory Strands are the postero-internal column (column of Goll), the direct cerebellar, and tlie antero-lateral ascending tract of Hadden and Gowers ; the p)ostero-intcrnal tract is situated in the j)Osterior column, close to the postero-median " fissure;" the direct cerebellar tract separates the crossed pyramidal tract from the surface of the cord; Avhile IIadden and Goaver's tract is situated

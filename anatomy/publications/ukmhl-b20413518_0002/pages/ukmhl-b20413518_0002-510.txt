494 Applied Anatomy: the relation of tlie three parts to the two barrels and ramrod of a double-barrelled gun; only in this case it is not the harrels that are perforated but the ramrod (Fig. 229). The root of the penis is formed by the bulb and the two crura. The crura are formed by the diverging corpora cavernosa, and are attached to the sides of the pubic arch; the bulb is formed by an expansion of the corpus spongiosum, and rests upon the anterior surface of the triangular ligament. Covering the bulb we find the accelerator iirince muscle, while each crus is covered by the erector penis muscle of the cor- responding side. In front, the corpora cavernosa end in rounded extremities, which are overlapped by the glans penis—the expanded anterior end of the corpus sj)ongiosum. Fig. 229. Section of Penis. The prepuce consists of two layers—an external or cutaneous layer, and an internal or mucous, or more properly, muco-cutaneous; as a matter of fact, the so-called " mucous " layer is really cutaneous. The skin passes for a variable distance beyond the glans, and is then folded in upon itself, forming the prepuce; and the internal layer is attached to the sulcus behind the corona glandis, where it blends with the mucous membrane covering the glans. Below the glans is the frcenum preputii, stretching from the lower angle of the meatus; in the fra3num is a small vessel which, if wounded, may give rise to serious hsemorrhage. Over the glans penis the mucous membrane is quite adherent to the underlying tissue, as there is no submucous tissue. The free margin of the prepuce, just where the thin, red, and moist muco-cutaneous layer joins the cutaneous or outer layer, is the narrowest part of the opening

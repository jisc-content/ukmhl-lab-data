475 Surgical, Medical, and Operatixie. The matrix consists of mucli delicate connective tissue, through which many thin-walled, cavernous-like vessels run. Occasionally, the remains of a belated foetus may be found in it. The cysts vary in size from a pea to a chestnut, and contain a glairy trans- parent fluid, like ropy mucus. These tumours are also known as " thyroid - dermoids," or congenital adenomata. They probably arise in connection with the post-anal gut and neurenteric passage (Sutton). It is possible that some of the congenital cysts in the neck may be due to a cystic degeneration of the inter-carotic body; to such LuscHKA gave the name of hygroma colli. Others have supposed that many of the hrancliial cysts develop from this body, while others again believe that the congenital fibro-cystic tumour of the neck may have a similar origin. It is more lilcely, however, that this latter condition may rather result from an intra - uterine transformation of a subcutaneous naavus. This growth must be distinguished from the true hydroreh colli, Avhich is beneath the deep fascia, and often passes from the neck into the thorax or axilla.

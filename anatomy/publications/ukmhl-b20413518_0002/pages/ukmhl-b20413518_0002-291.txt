Insert the outer row of longitudinal sutures by handled needles, enclosing a four-sided or six-sided area of the stomach wall, and ap^Droximating it to the abdominal wall; these are introduced at some distance—say an inch—from the edge of the wound and go through the whole thickness of the abdominal wall, but, if possible, not through the mucous coat of the stomach.

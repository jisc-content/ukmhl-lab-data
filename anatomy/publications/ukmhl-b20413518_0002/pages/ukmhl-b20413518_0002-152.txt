130 Applied Anatoiny: CHAPTER XXXI. THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The more important points aloout the surface Anatomy have already been indicated when speaking about fractures and dis- locations. I would only point out the groove on each side of the biceps in the upper arm: the outer one corresponds pretty closely to the course of the cephalic vein, and the inner to the brachial artery and the basilic vein. On tlie outer side the groove is continued upwards between the pectoralis major and the deltoid; in this part of the groove we find (1) the cephalic vein, (2) the humeral branch of the thoracic axis, and (3) at its upper end one or two lymphatic glands which communicate both over and under the clavicle with glands in the base of the posterior triangle. THE AXILLA. In describing this space, note—(a) Position.—It is a space between the upper part of the arm and the upper part of the side of the chest. (&) Shape.—In shape it resembles a four-sided pyramid, but the sides are not equal — the inner side is much larger than the outer, and the posterior wall extends further down than the anterior, (c) Boundaries.—The liase is formed by the integuments and the strong axillary fascia: the aiKx is directed upwards towards the root of the neck, and corresponds to an interval between the first rib, clavicle, and upper border of the scapula, and is triangular in shape. The anterior wall is formed by the pectoralis major and minor: behind are the sub- scapularis, latissimus dorsi and teres major: to the inner side, the upper five or six ribs with their intercostal muscles, and the ujiper part of serratus maguus: the outer wall is formed by the coraco-

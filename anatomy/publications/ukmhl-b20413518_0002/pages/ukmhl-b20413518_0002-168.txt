Applied Anatomy: 152 A slight variation of this classification would probably be more correct, thus:— 1. The superficial form, between the tAvo layers of skin or round the root of the nail. 2. In the cellular tissue, from a poisoned wound, and in some cases idiopathically. 3. Under the periosteum, usually only of the terminal phalanx, and leading to necrosis of part of phalanx, (a) As a primary " acute necrosis." (h) Secondary to the cellular tissue whitlow. 4. In the sheath of the tendon— (rt) As a result of tension and burrowing, because not opened sufficiently early. (h) Caused by the Surgeon opening the sheath of the tendon Avhen incising a cellular tissue whitlow. This infects the synovial sheath Avith septic material, and the usual results are—spread of the inflammation, sloughing of the tendons, and a useless finger. It is unnecessary, and even harmful in such cases, to " cut doAvn to the bone." In opening a WhitloAV, tAvo things must be attended to— (1) To have something firm (wood or stone) behind the patient's hand; in this way the hand cannot descend from the knife, it can only be drawn back. (2) Cut with the edge of the knife directed toAvards the tip of the finger, so that, as the hand can only be pulled back and not depressed, the incision Avill be enlarged in the proper direction, and no injury done to patient or Surgeon. As in all probability, AvhitloAV never hegim in the sheath of the tendon, it is unnecessary to open into the sheath—in fact, such an incision Avill do more harm than good; in cases where it is iuA'^olved secondarily, it must be opened, but such a case Avill probably come to amputation. WhitloAV is most often seen in the terminal phalanges, or else in the first phalanges, close to the j^alm. Tlic cedema on the hack of the finger or hand must not mislead the student as to the true seat of the suppuration; tlie tissues on the palm arc too dense to become ccdematous.

A pad of peritoneum is thus placed upon the abdominal side of the internal opening, where, owing to the abdominal aspect of the circumference of the internal ring having been refreshed, new adhesions may form (Fig. 195). 2. Closure of the Inguinal Canal.—The sac having been returned into the abdomen and secured to the abdominal circum- ference of the ring, this aperture is closed in front of it in the following manner:—The finger is introduced into the canal, and lies Fig. 195.

It makes out the position of the epigastric artery, so as to avoid it. The threaded hernia needle is then introduced, and, guided by the index finger, is made to penetrate the conjoint tendon in two places; first, from without inwards, near the lower border of the conjoint tendon; second, from within outwards, as high up as possible on the inner aspects of the canal. This double penetration of the conjoint tendon is accomplished by a single .screw-like turn of the instrument (Fig. 196). One single thread is then withdrawn from the point of the needle by the index finger, and when this is accomplished, the needle, along with the other extremity of the thread, is removed.

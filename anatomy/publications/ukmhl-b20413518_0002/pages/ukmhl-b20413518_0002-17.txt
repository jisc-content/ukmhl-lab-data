APPLIED ANATOMY: SURGICAL, MEDICAL, AND OPEMTIYE. (CHAPTER XXIX. HEAD AND NECK. RELATIONS OF THE TRACHEA. The tracliea extends from the lower border of the cricoid cartilage (or opjDosite the sixth cervical vertebra) to the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra — disc between the fourth and fifth (Quain)—• where it divides into the. two bronclii. The point of bifurcation corresponds, in front, to the jimction between the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum ; at this point also it is crossed by the arch of the aorta. It is usually said to extend from the fifth cervical to the third dorsal vertebra; but in the above numbers I have followed the teaching of the Edinburgh School. Its position varies with the position of the head—fiexed or extended; when the head {lasses from the ordinary position to one of extension, nearly an incli moi'e of the trachea is drawn up into the neck above the sternum. The larynx and upper part of the; trachea ai'c also raised iluring deglutition, and during inspiration its length in the neck is diminished, because the upper margin of tlie thorax is raised. These changes of position are rciadily admitted because of the fibro-elastic membrane, which forms tlie basework of the trachea, ami in which the cartilaginous rings are embedded. The move- mcnts taking place during deglutition are useful in sharply diagnosing all tumours connected with the trachea—e.fj., goitre ;

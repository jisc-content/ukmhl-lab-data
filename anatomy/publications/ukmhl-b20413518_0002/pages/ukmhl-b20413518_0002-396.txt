Applied Anatomy: 380 CHAPTER XJ. THE ABDOMEN—f(7on^«me(0- FEMORAL HERNIA. IL will be well at this point to say a word or two about the anterior j^art of the fascia lata of the thigh and the saphenous opening. The fascia consists of (1) an iliac part, lying external to the saphenous opening, and (2) a puhic part, lying internal to the same opening. The iliac part is attached to the crest of the ilium, anterior superior spine, Poupart'.s ligament, and tlie pectineal line, and becomes continuous below with the pubic part. From tlie pectineal line and spine of the pubes it is reflected down, forming the superior cornu and the falciform process of the saphenous opeiiing. The i:)uhic part is attached above to the i:)cctineal line, and internally to the margin of the pubic arch; it passes beneath the sheath of the femoral vessels, binding do^vn the psoas and iliacus muscles, and is then lost on the capsule of the hip joint. At the lower part it becomes continuous with the iliac part, and at the point where tlie two meet they form the inferior cornu of the saphenous opening. The iliac part thus passes in front of the femoral vessels, w-hile the pubic part passes heliind them, and between the two is the saphenous opening. This is an oval ojiening at tlie upper and inner part of the thigh, just below the inner end of Poupakt's ligament, and internal to the line of the femoral vessels, and is produced by the above splitting and folding of the fascia lata of the thigh. It is directed obliquely downwards, forwards, and iuAvards; its length is an inch and a half, and its width about half an inch. Its lower margin is M-ell defined, and is called the inferior cornu; its upper margin, the (superior cornu/ its outer edge, the falciform process of Bunxs; its inner edge, ho\vever, is ill defined, and lies, as we have seen,

Applied Anatomy: 62 CHAPTER XXX. WOUNDS OF THE SCALP. These, however slight, should be watched very carefully, because of the close anatomical relations that exist between the internal and the external structures of the cranium, and the possibility, therefore, of the effects of the injury implicating the brain and its membranes; and all the more so when we bear in mind that, from the nature of the textures wounded, they are far more likely to be followed by erysipelas and diffuse septic cellulitis than wounds in other parts of the body. Sometimes, too, the external injury may seem very trifling, and yet the internal injury be very great; every case should be carefidly watched for at least a fortnight. In wounds into the scalp there is no gaping of the edges of the wound, but in incisions tltrotujli the scalp there is much gaping, opening up the " dangerous area " and exposing the pericranium at the bottom of the wound. AU cases of head injuries must be kept under observation for at least a fortnight, as inflammatory processes are often not developed for a considerable time after the accident. The chief anatomical peculiarities of the scalp are—(1) The great amount of dense fibrous tissue that enters into its formation. (2) Its great vas- cularity, and, consequently, (3) its great vital activity. (■4) Its vascular connections with the cranial bones and dura mater; this is especially the case with the cellular tissue on its deep surface, whicli is largely permeated by blood-vessels, which enter the bones and communicate in the diploii with branches from the dura mater. At several places, also, large vessels pass directly through from the scalp or face, and communicate with the various sinuses and arteries within the cranium—e.g., at the occiput, the meningeal branches of the occipital artery anastomose with those of the

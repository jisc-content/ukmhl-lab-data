Applied Anatomy: 320 The gall bladder may be entirely removed, after closing the cystic duct, by ligature, close to its entry into the common duct. This operation is called Cholecystectomy, and has been performed by Knowsley Thornton. In cases of complete obliteration of the common bile duct, the gall bladder may be stitched to the jejunum, and, after adhesions have formed, an opening may be made from the gall bladder into the gut. Tliis operation is known as Cholecystenterostomy. Gall stones.—The chief ingredients of gall stones are cliolesterine and inspissated mucus; other matters present are colouring matter ((■liolochrome), phosphate and carbonate of lime and magnesia, biliary and fatty acids. They are distinguished from urinary calculi—(1) By being much lighter, when dry, they float in water; though when first taken out they are slightly heavier than water, and just sink. (2) Tliey have a greasy or fatty feel. (3) The colour differs from the usual urinary calculi. (4) Their shape is more markedly facetted and triangular than urinary calcidi. (5) Glistening fracture.

867 Surgical, Medical, and Operative, An exploration of tlie sac and its contents is then made, and the finser introduced tlirougli the canal examines the abdominal asi^ects of the internal ring and the relative position of the epigastric artery. The operation may then he divided into two parts, the one relating to the establishment of a pad on the abdominal aspects of the internal ring, the other to the closure of the incruinal canal. The steps of the operation are as follows :— 1. The Formation of a Pad on the Abdominal Surface of the Circumference of the Internal Ring.—(a) Free and elevate the distal extremity of the sac, preserving along with it any adipose tissue that may be adherent to it; when this is done pull down Fig. 193. Treatment of Sac. The Sac transfixed and drawn into a Series of Folds. the sac, and, while maintaining tension upon it, introduce the index finger into the inguinal canal, separating the sac from the cord and from the parietes of the canal. (&) Insert the index finger outside the sac till it reaches the internal ring; there separate with its tip the peritoneum for about half-an-iucli round the whole abdominal aspects of the circumference of the ring (Fig. 192). (r) A stitch is secured firmly to the distal extremity of the sac. The end of the thread is then passed in a proximal direction several times through the sac, so that when jjulled ujion, the sac becomes folded upon itself like a curtain (Fig. 193). The free end of this stitch, threaded on a hernia needle, is introduced through the canal to the abdominal aspeft of the fascia

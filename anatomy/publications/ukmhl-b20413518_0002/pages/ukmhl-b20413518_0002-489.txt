Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 473 residue is left. Cool, and add ammonia, when we get a niagnificeut purple (murexicle test). (c) Dissolve in caustic potasli and heat. No smell of ammonia. 2. Urate of Ammonia— («) Like urates generally, is soluble in hot water, but deposited on cooling. {h) Dissolve in caustic potash and heat. Smell of ammonia. {c) Apply the murexide test to demonstrate the presence of uric acid, or— (cZ) Add hydrochloric acid, and you get a precipitate of uric acid. 3. Phosphate of Lime— [a) Add hydrochloric acid. Dissolves without efferves- cence. To this solution add ammonia, which will produce a white gelatinoiis precipitate. To a part of this— [h) Add a drop of neutral ferric chloride. A yellowish- white precipitate of ferric phosphate is thrown down. To another part— ('■) Add ammonium oxalate. White precipitate of oxalate of lime. 4. Triple Phosphate—Ammonio-magnesian phosphate— (a) Heat in blow-pipe. Chars and gives off a smell of ammonia, and finally fuses. [h) Heat with caustic potash, when ammonia is set free and the magnesia falls as a white flocculent precipitate. (c) Soluble in hydrochloric acid, but is thrown down, when this solution is neutralised with ammonia, as a crystalline precipitate. ;■). The "Fusible Calculus"—mixture of phosphate of lime and " triple phosphate"— («) In the blow-pipe, fuses very easily without being consumed; at the same time ammonia and water are driven off.

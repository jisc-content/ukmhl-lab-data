It enters the fore-arm by passing between the two heads of the flexor carpi uluaris, passes straight down, lying upon tbe flexor profundus digitorum, and covered by the flexor carpi uluaris; for the lower two thirds of its course it lies to the inner side of the ulnar artery, and between the tendons of the flexor sublimis and tlic flexor carpi uluaris, and at the Avrist crosses the annular ligament, and enters the palm. The guide for this nerve is the pisiform l)oue and the tendon of the flexor carpi uluaris; it lies immediately to the outer or radial side of these structures. This nerve supplies the elbow and Avrist joints, and the following muscles—in the fore-arm, the flexor carpi uluaris and tlie inner half of the flexor profundus; in the hand, the palmaris brevis, all the intrinsic muscles of the little finger, all the dorsal and palmar interossei, the third and fourth lumbricales muscles, the adductor pollicis, and the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Results of Paralysis. — (1) Impaired flexion of the ring and little fingers; (2) impaired ulnar flexion of the wrist; (3) the action of the interossei and of the two inner lumbricales lost; and (4) the tliumb cannot be adducted, and the action of the flexor brevis is imi)aired. The Sheaths of the Flexor Tendons.—AVhen erysipelatous inflammation attacks the sheaths of the flexor tendons in the fingers (whitlow), or more frequently in the case of septic wounds, there is great pain, owing to the resistant nature of the structures attacked, and consequent tension, and it is at the same time fraught Avith danger to the utility of the finger or hand. Pus forms very rapidly, and finds its way up the synovial sheaths of the flexor tendons to the hand and common synovial sheatli under tlie anterior annular ligament; and, if the disease be not checked by timely interference, the sheaths and tendons are rapidly de- stroyed, the joiuts of the fingers injured, and the phalanges may even necrose or the finger become gangrenous, and the ei'ysipelatous inflammation extend up the fore-arm. 8u]>puratiuii occurring in

The sheath is formed by tlie splitting of the ajjoneurosis of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen, one half passing in front, the other behind the muscle. From the ensiform cartilage to a point midway between the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis, the anterior half is joined by the aponeurosis of the external oblique, the posterior half by the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle; hence, at this part of its course, the sheath consists of a layer and a half in front of the muscle, and a layer and a half behind it (see Fig. 178). But from the point above indicated to the symphysis pubis, all the three layers pass in front of the rectus, and the muscle rests behind on the fascia transversalis (Fig. 177). The lower free margin of the posterior lamella usually presents a Fig. 177. Sheath of Rectus. (From Ciinninoham's " Abdunion.") lixteriiid (.)bliquc. liitenial Oblique. 'J'niiisvcr.siUis.

The dotted line represents the Peritoneum. sharp, semilunar edge, with the concavity towards the pubes; this corresponds to the point where all the layers pass to the front of the muscle, and is known as the semilunar fold of Dowjlas. It is at this point that the deep epigastric artery enters the sheath of the rectus. Contents of the Sheath.—(1) The rectus muscle; (2) the pyramidalis muscle; (3) the terminal twigs of the six lower inter- costal nerves and the last dorsal nerve; (4) the superior epigastric artery (one of the terminal branches of the internal mammary); and (.5) the deep epigastric artery. The Linea Semilunaris (Fig. 17G, r/).—This is a curved line' at the outer edge of each rectus muscle, and corresponds therefore to the line along which the aponeurosis of the internal oblique

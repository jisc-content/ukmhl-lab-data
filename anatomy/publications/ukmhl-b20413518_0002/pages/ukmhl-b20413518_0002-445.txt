Length.—The length of this caual in the male is from eight to uiue inches J in the female it is only about an inch and a half in length, and corresponds, as we have seen, to the prostatic portion of the male urethra. Divisions.—In the male it is divided into three parts, {a) The prostatic portion. This part is about au inch and a quarter in length, and passes almost directly downwards, but slightly forwards. It is situated about the middle of the prostate gland, but rather nearer its anterior surface, and is in front of the middle lobe. In connection with it we notice the following parts :—(1) As it opens into the bhidder there is a transverse fold of mucous membrane, called the " uvula vesicae." (2) Continuous with this, there is a median ridge, called the crest of the urethra, cajjut galUnagliiis or veramoutauum, (3) On either side of this crest there is a depression called the prostatic sinus, and in it may be seen the openings of numerous prostatic ducts. (4) At the summit of the crest there is a median opening called the sinus pocidaris; and (o) at each side in the walls of the sinus are seen the openings of the common ejaculatonj ducts, (b) The membranous portion.— Tlie length of this part is—anterior wall, three-quarters of an inch; posterior wall, half-au-inch. It is directed forwards and downwards, but more downwards than forwards, extending from the apex of tlie prostate gland to the bulbous portion of the urethra, and is contained between the two layers of the triangular ligament, the anterior layer of which it pierces, and is about an inch below the symphysis pubis. It is surrounded by the compressor

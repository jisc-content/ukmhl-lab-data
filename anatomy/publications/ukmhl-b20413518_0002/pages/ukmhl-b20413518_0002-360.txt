344 Applied Anatomy: the " descent of the testicles" in tlie male subject. We liave described the descent of tlie testicle at this point, because one form of inguinal hernia takes exactly the same course, and receives similar coverings. In some cases the descent is incomplete, or the testicle is misplaced. It must first be sought for in the inguinal canal, then in the iliac fossa close to Poupart's ligament, and, lastly, in the permasum or crural canal. A misplaced testicle is more apt to become inflamed, or the seat of malignant disease, than a testicle in its proper place. Fig. 187. Normal Condition of the Processus Vaginalis in the Adult.

The Oblique.—This form is named oblique, or indirect, from the direction it takes, i:)assing through the oblique inguinal canal; it is also called external from its relation to the deep epigastric artery, which lies to its inner side. It is most common in young males. It takes the same course as the testicle did—that is, it enters at the internal abdominal ring, passes through the whole length of the canal, and escapes by the external ring into the scrotum; it passes through that part of the triangular space concerned in inguinal hernia that lies to the outer side of the epigastric artery, and whose structure has already been described (see Fig. 18G). The hernia visually passes down in front of the cord, between the cord and its coverings; its neck lies above Poupart's ligament, and internal to the spine of the pubes. The spine of the pubes and the external abdominal "ring" can be best felt in the male by iuvaginating tlie scrotum with the pohit .of the fingey &nd then passing it up in front of the cord. The

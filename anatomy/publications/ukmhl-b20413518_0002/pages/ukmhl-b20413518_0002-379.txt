Snrg^ical, Medical, and Operative. 363 and incarcerated non-strangulated hernia there is no Huid in the sac. When the sac is opened some fluid usually escapes, and it is customary to smell this fluid, as it will indicate to some extent the state of the gut. The gut will be recognised by its smooth glistening appearance and transverse ramifying arteries. 8. Introduce the director and notch the tight margin with the bistoury, its edge being directed upwards; with- draw the director, introduce tlie finger and divide the deeper part of the constriction, with the finger as guide, keeping the edge of the knife in the same direction as before. 9. Disengage the gut, draw it gently down, so that the constricted point, and especially the part immediately above it, can be examined and its fitness for reduction judged of. The principal points to note are, the colour, gloss, and smell; the most important is the gloss; if this is lost, the prognosis is grave. If in doubt, having divided the constriction, leave the gut opposite the wound; if not, reduce it, following it with the finger right mto the abdominal cavity, so as to make sure that it is properly reduced. 10. After this, separate the neck of the sac, as high in the canal as possible; shoidd the hernia be congenital, this will be difficult, as it practically forms part of the spermatic cord. 11. Tie the neck of the sac, with "fascia 2jroj)ria" round it, high up, flush with the interior of the abdomen, with strong catgut ligature. The part belo'sv the ligature may or may not be removed. 12. Lastly, stitch the walls of the canal together with catgut, but leaving enough room for the cord to pass below without being compressed; stitch the external wound, introduce a drainage tube, and dress. It will be observed, therefore, that, from a Surgeon's point of view, there are but five structures to divide, viz. â€” (1) Skin and fascia, (2) external oblique, (3) cremasteric fascia, (4) "fascia propria," and (5) sac.

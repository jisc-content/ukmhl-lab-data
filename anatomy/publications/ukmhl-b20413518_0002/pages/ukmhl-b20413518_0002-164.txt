148 Applied Anatomy: The Median Nerve.—This nerve arises by two roots, one from the outer and the other from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, ■which join either in front or to the outer side of the axillary artery. It then lies to the outer side of the third part of the axillary and the upper joart of the brachial; it then crosses the brachial very obliquely, and lies on its inner side, at the bend of the elbow, beneath the bicipital fascia. It enters the fore-arm by passing between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, lies on the iiexor profundus, covered by the flexor sublimis, to within two inches of the wrist joint, where it becomes more superficial, lying between the tendons of the flexor sublimis and the flexor carpi radialis, beneath, or rather to the ulnar side of, the tendon of the palmaris longus. This nerve supplies directly four muscles in the fore-arm—the pronator radii teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor sublimis digitorum : by its anterior interosseus branch it supplies the flexor longus pollicis, the pi'onator quadratus, and part of the flexor profundus. In the hand it supplies the abductor pollicis, the opponens pollicis, half of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the two outer lumbricales— the first and second. To Expose this Nerve, for the purposes of stretching, make a short median incision just to the idnar side of the palmaris longus, the tendon of this muscle being used as tlie guide to the nerve. The only structures divided are the skin and superficial and deep fascia. Results of Paralysis.—(1) Loss of the power of flexion in the second phalanges of all the fingers, and in the third phalanges of the index and middle fingers; (2) the thumb is extended and adducted, and can neither be flexed nor opposed; and (3) pronation is lost entirely. On account, however, of the activity of the idnar nerve, we find—(1) The power of partial flexion of the ring and little fingers at the third phalanges, through the ulnar half of the flexor profundus; (2) the power of flexing of the first phalanges, and extending the other two through the interossei; and (3) the power of flexing the wrist at the ulnar side by the flexor carpi ulnaris, best seen when the hand is adducted. The Ulnar Nerve.—It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and lies to the inner side of the axillary and brachial

The hernia only extends to the Uyi) of the testicle and does not envelop it; it is always oblique and suddenly produced. There is another congenital malformation of the processus vaginalisâ€”viz., where the entire canal remains open, but an annular constriction of its walls takes place somewhere between the external abdominal ring and the testicle. In this condition we may get what is called an " Hour-glass Hernia." In the female there is a jDrocess of peritoneum that passes down along the round ligament, corresponding to the processus vaginalis of the male, and is known as the Canal of Nuck; from the presence of this structure, the female child is very frequently the subject of congenital inguinal hernia. It may also occur in the adult female as well; the inguinal canal in the female is slightly longer than in the male. The contents of the hernial sac vary. If it consist of the intestine alone, it is called an Enterocele; it is resonant on per- cussion, smooth and elastic, and gurgles on manipulation, from tlie mixture of air and fluid. It is usually some part of the small intestine, most frequently the ileum; sometimes the caput ctecum of the large. Hernia of the omentiim is called Epiplocele; it is didl on percussion, firm, lobulated, and doughy, and there is no gurgle on manipidation; and the impulse on coughing may be very slight or absent. Hernia of both intestine and omentum together, is called an Entero - Epiplocele; the symptoms are a mixture of the two previous forms.

135 Surgical, Medica/, and Operative. From the deep surface of this hiyer, as it cusheaths the sterno- inastoid, a strong process passes inwards across the neck, and forms the carotid sheath, and then passes in front of the pre-vertebral muscles, but behind the pharynx and oesophagus, to unite with the layer of the opposite side. This part is attached above to various points at the base of the skull, and specially to the angle of the lower jaw and the styloid process, and the part intervening between these two points is known as the sti/lo-maxillary ligament, which separates the parotid from tlie submaxillary gland. As this layer passes down, it divides into two parts. One is placed beneath the depressors of the hyoid bone, invests the thyroid body and at the sides is attached to the first rib and binds down the central tendon of the omo-hyoid muscle to that bone, Avhile the central part passes down in front of the trachea and large vessels and becomes con- tinuous with the fibrous pericardium. The other layer passes into the thorax in front of the pre-vertebral muscles but behind the cesophagus. If pus form in front of the former it will most likely find its way into the axilla at the side, or anterior mediastinum in front; if behind it, it will gravitate towards the apex of the pleura and lung at the sides, or middle mediastinum in front; if it form beneath the latter division, it will tend to pass into the posterior mediastinum.

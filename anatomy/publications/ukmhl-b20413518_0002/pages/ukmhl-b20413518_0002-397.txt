The mjtcrior cortm touches Poupart's ligament and is situated about midway between the spine of the pubes and the femoral vessels. There is a strong band of fibres passing between the superior cornu of the falciform border of the saphenous opening, and Guibernat's ligament; it arches over the femoral artery, and is known as the femoral ligament of Hey. This so called opening, however, in the recent state, is covered by the cribriform or sieve-like fascia—this fascia being perforated by a large number of lymphatic vessels, and the long saphenous vein, hence the name. If the fascia lata and the cribriform fascia be reflected, Wx^ femoral sheath is exjjosed (see Fig. 159); the anterior part of this sheath is a continuation of the fascia transversalis Fig. 206. Formation of the Femoral Sheath. F;isoia Trausvorsalis i lining the abdominal wall, and passing down beneath Poupart's ligament; the posterior part of the sheath is a continuation of the fascia iliaca, also from the abdomen (Fig. 206). On the anterior part of this sheath there are a few thickened transverse bands of fascia just below Poupart's ligament, which are called the "cZefip miral arch" (the "stqjerfcial crural arch" being Poupart's ligament). The femoral or crural sheath is funnel-shaped, being too wide just beneath Poupart's ligament, but closely adherent to the vessels about one inch below the saphenous opening; it is divided into three compartments, by septa passing from the anterior to the posterior wall—the external contains the femoral artery, the midflle the femoral vein, while the inner contains and is closed by condensed areolar tissue, a lymphatic gland, and some lymphatic ,•<_..Fascia Iliaca.

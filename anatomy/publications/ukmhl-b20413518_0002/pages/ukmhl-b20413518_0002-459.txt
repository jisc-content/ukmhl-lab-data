Ill covtain forms penile strictures, internal urethrotomy, cutting from behind forwards, may be adopted; after this tic in a catheter to keep the cut surface free from uriuo, and lessen the risk of " urinary fever." 13. In many cases Professor Annan DALE prefers the method of combined external and internal division. A !N'o. 2 catheter is passed tlirough the stricture into the bladder, and then a free incision is made in the middle line, behind the most posterior stricture. The catheter is next removed, and the grooved staff of a urethrotome is passed along the urethra; the urethrotome used closely resembles Maissonneuve's instrument. The knife of the urethrotome is now passed along the groove of the staff, and all the strictures divided. After this, pass a Xo. 12 catheter, and keep it in for twenty-four hours. The advantages of this method are—(1) The complete and accurate division of all the strictured parts; and (2) the ease with which the oj)eration can be accomplished. In treating stricture cases for the first time, it is important to avoid, as far as possible, the risks from " urinary fever":— 1. The patient should rest in bed for a week or ten days if possible, and have his diet restricted to milk and soda-water. 2. In passing the bougie, aU unnecessary exposure should be avoided, and his legs and chest covered with blankets to keej^ him warm. 3. See that the instruments passed are i^erfectly clean, as many Surgeons arc inclined to say, and with truth, that "urinary fever" is often nothing more than " dirty catheter fever," 4. As soon as the instruments arc passed, the patient is carefully covered up in bed, and should at once get a warm drink. 5. He should be directed to keep his water as long as possible after this, lest the catheter may have caused some slight abrasion of the mucous membrane.

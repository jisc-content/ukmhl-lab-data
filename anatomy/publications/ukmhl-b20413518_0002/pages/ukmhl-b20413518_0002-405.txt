Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 389 sac flusli with the iuterior of the abdomen, and out off the pro- truding part, leaving the stump to plug up the opening, or stitch it to Gimbernat's hgament; or it may be entirely reduced into tlie abdomen, and the various fascial structures about the open- in" stitched together. Tlius tlie inferior cornu of Gi.mbernat's ligament, or the fascia covering the pidiic bone may be stitched obliquely to Poupart's ligament, or the pubic part of the fascia lata may be stitched to the same structure. The chief points of the operation are (1) to get rid of the sac, and (2) take care of the femoral vein. Tiie obliteration of the canal is brought about by—(1) Leaving an omental stump to plug up the crural ring, (2) tying the neck of the sac, and (3) stitching the resistant tissues together outside, over the canal—e.g., the pubic part of the fascia lata to Poupart's ligament.

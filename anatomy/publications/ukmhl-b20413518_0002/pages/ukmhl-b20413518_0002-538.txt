The peritoneum is stripped aside, and the wedge-shaped mass cut out, the apex of the wedge being towards the uterine cavity. In this way two flaps of peritoneum are left, one on each side of the original incision, and when the wound is closed the peritoneal flaps are tucked in, just as in Lembert's suture of the intestine, and stitched together. This ensures rapid union between the cut surfaces. " MLiller's Ablation" is an operation performed ia some cases of uterine fibroids; in this operation the abdomen is opened, the tumour, and the uterus containing a non-viable foetus, removed.

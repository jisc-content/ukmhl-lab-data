It is rarely neces- sary to divide these tendons; it will generally be found sufficient to forcibly draw the foot inwards so as to overcome the tension of I he pcronei, and then fixing the foot by a properly-constructed splint. If, however, it be found necessary to divide them, the li'iidons of the peroneus longus and brevis may be divided, as they lie one above the other in the groove on the back of the fibula— i.e., beliind and above the external malleolus; the tendon of the tertius may be divided near its insertion, on the outer side of the dorsum of the foot by rendering it tense and inserting a tenotomy knife between it and the skin, and dividing it in the usual manner, lu bad cases, it may be necessary also to remove a Avedge from the inner border of the foot; probably the astragalus had better be attacked, as this does not interfere with the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which would probably be cut were the wedge removed from the scaphoid. 1. Talipes Calcaneus.—In tliis form the toes are raised by I the extensors, and the patient wallvs upon his heel. It is very rare to find this form congenital (Spence), although some Surgeons say tliat it is usually congenital, and very frequently associated M'itli xpina Injida. In tlie coiu/ciiitnl foim, the anterior part of the foot points npwards and for\vards; but in tlic ao/iiired form tlic anterior part of the font droops till it almost touches tlie ^'ronnd; licnce, there is a largo hollow between the heel and llie toes. Causes—(a) Clontraction of cicatrices, following burns on the anterior aspect of the leg; (Ji) contraction of tlie flexor tendons of the ankle joint and the; extensors of tlie toes (indirect

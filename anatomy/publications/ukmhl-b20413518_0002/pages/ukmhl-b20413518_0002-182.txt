166 Applied Anatomy: this position there is greatest general relaxation, and the cavity holds most. (Jl) Ahdudion, which relaxes tlie outer limb of the ilio- femoral ligament and upper part of tlie capsule, {c) Krersinn, which relaxes the inner head of the same ligament, and the horizontal posterior fibres of the capsule, (r?) Apparent lengthening, from the tilting down of the pelvis on tliat side; the anterior superior spine moves dowmvards, forwards, and inwards. Tliis is because the flexion and the abduction raise the foot ofl" the ground and destroys the parallelism of the two limbs; hence, when the patient walks, to enable the foot to reach the ground and also to restore that parallelism which is necessary for walking, the pelvis tilts.

'I'o slinw the Lumhar Curve, when the Knee, lies flat on the tnlile. To detect the tilting of the pelvis draw one line from the xiphoid cartilage through the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis, and another between the two anterior superior spines. In health these lines should cross each other at rigid angle>^. (e) Lordosit^â€”this is because the hip joint is fixed by muscles in the flexed position, and to overcome this disadvantage the lumbar vertebra? move instead, and are also curved forwards. This is well seen when the patient is laid on a firm table on his back ; as he lies in this position his knee is bout upwards (Fig. 160), and on attcraptmg to bring the knee down level with the table the lumbar spine becomes hollow, because the pelvis moves Avith the femur (Fig. 101). Besides these symptoms J

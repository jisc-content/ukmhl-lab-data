Tliis braces lip and supports the varicose veins, like a well-fitting, natural elastic stocking (see vol. ii., page 173). Hare's Angle. — Professor Hark states that the fissure of lloLANDo forms an angle of 'sixty-seven degrees with the sagittal suture. This angle can very easily be found by means of an ordinary half sheet of paper, or the comer of a newspaper for that matter—in short, any piece of soft material cut at a right angle. The right angle is first bisected by carefully doubling the paper over. After this the paper is again folded so as to bisect the angles of forty-five degrees first formed. The right angle is thus divided into four equal angles of 22*5 degrees each. Three of these are added together, which gives an angle of 67 "5 degrees, which is near enough for all practical purposes. The edge of the paper is then laid upon the sagittal suture, so that the angle corresponds with the jwint that indicates the ujjper end of the fissure of Kolando—viz., half-an-inch behind a point midway between the root of the nose and the external occipital pro- tuberance. The fissure passes downwards and forwards for three and three-quarter inches (Fig. 235; sec also vol. ii., page 78).

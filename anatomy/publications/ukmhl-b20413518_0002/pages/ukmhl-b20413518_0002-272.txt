Applied Anatomy: 256 each piece; occasionally, however, the lower two or three pieces of the body are developed from two centres, each placed laterally. Sometimes the lateral centres fail to unite, giving rise to a con- dition known as sternal fissure, where there is a narrow slit left, or denial foramen, where there is a larger hole left between the pieces. The upper border of the sternum, at the end of expiration, is on a level with the disc between the second and third dorsal vertebra. Lymphatics of the Thorax.—The glands of this cavity are divided into—(1) Tntcrcodal, placed between the two sets of intercostal muscles. (2) The Internal Mammary, in close relation with the internal mammary vessels. (3) The Anterior Mediastinal placed in the loose tissue of that space. (4) The Posterior Medias- tinal, round the aorta and the cesophagus, communicating on each side with the intercostal, below with the lumbar, and above with the deep cervical glands; they also receive communications from the bronchial glands, Avhich return the lymph from the lungs. The bronchial glands are situated around the bifurcation of the trachea and root of the lung; these glands, as well as the anterior mediastinal group, are enlarged in the various forms of lymphadenoma, and in cancerous affections, and may give rise to difficulty of breathing from pressure on the air passages. TABLE OF PARTS OPPOSITE THE SPINES OF THE VERTEBRAE (slightly modified from Holden). Cervical Region,—5th. Cricoid cartilage: the pharynx ends: the a3sophagus begins. 6th. 7th. Apex of the lung: slightly higher in the female than the male. Dorsal Region. — 1st. 2nd. 3rd. Aorta reaches the spine (left side of the body of the fourth vertebra): apex of lower lobe of lung: angle of bifurcation of the trachea. 4th. Aortic arch ends (left side ot the body of tlie fifth vertebra): upper level of heart.

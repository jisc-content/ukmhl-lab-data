509 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. The Ovary consists of three parts, each of wliicli may give rise to cj'sts :— 1. The Odphoron, or ovary proper, the egg-bearing part. 2. The Paroophoron, which is lodged in the concavity of the oi-iphoron, and usually known as the hilus. It is almost entirely composed of the remains of the Wolffian body, in various stages of retrogression. 3. The Parovarium.—It is connected with the parooiDhoron, and consists of a series of vertical tubes, the persistent remains of the excretory ducts of the AVolffian body. It consists of three parts—(a) A distal series of tubules, attached by one end only—Kobelt's tubes; {h) a row of tubes, connected by one end with the paroophoron, while the other end joins (c) a common collecting canal, the representative of the segmental duct in the adult female, known as G^ertner's duct. Parovarian cysts are situated above the ovary proper, Avhile the Fallopian tube arches over their upper border. UTERINE FIBROIDS. These tumours consist of fibrous tissue and non-striped muscle in varying proportions, and are more properly called fihro-myomata, or they may even be pure myomata. In the first instance they all spring from the muscular coat of the uterus, but as they increase in size they may assume one of three positions, or varieties. Varieties.—1. Subperitoneal, when they grow outwards into the peritoneal cavity, and either fiU up the abdominal cavity or become jammed in the pelvis. This variety does not cause haemor- rhage or increase of menstruation. If it is not too large it may be removed as in ovariotomy, securing the pedicle as there described, or stitching the peritoneum over the face of the stump. AVlien large or numerous, perform " Hysterectomy." 2. Interstitial, where the tumour remains and continues to grow in the wall of the uterus, and does not become pedunculated. They are soft or firm : the soft form causes great ha^uorrliage. For their treatment We may (1) perform Battey's operation, or

Applied Anatomy: 548 CHAPTER XLVIIL ADDENDA. Many of the points in this Chapter have been inadvertently left out in the body of the book. Annandale's Operation for Displaced Semilunar Cartilage.— Instruments req.uired.—A knife, artery forceps, ligatures, dissecting forceps, blunt hooks, sponges, sutures, needles, and dressings. A transverse incision is made, parallel Avith, and just over, the head of the tibia, and the displaced cartilage, on the injured side. The incision extends from near the edge of the ligamentum patellae backwards for about three or four inches. If this does not expose the cartilage properly, it may be supplemented by another incision, at right angles to it, upwards or downwards as the case may require. The various structures are cut through, till the capsule of the joint is exposed; all bleeding vessels are then secured, and the joint opened. The displaced cartilage is next hooked into the wound, by means of a blunt hook, and stitched to the jjeriosteum of the head of the tibia with catgut sutures. The woimd is then closed, and dressed antiseptically. In certain cases, where the cartilage seems affected with fatty degeneration, Professor Annan- DAiwE removes it altogether. This does not seem to aftect the usefulness of the joint in the very least (see vol. i., page 405). Annandale's Operation for Displaced Cartilage of the Lower Jaw.—A .slightly-curved incision, three-quarters of an inch long, is made over the posterior edge of the lateral ligament, and carried down to the capsule. All bleeding vessels are then tied, the capsule opened, and the cartilage seized and drawn into position. It is then stitched to the periosteum and other tissues, at the outer margin, by catgut sutures (see vol. ii., page 41).

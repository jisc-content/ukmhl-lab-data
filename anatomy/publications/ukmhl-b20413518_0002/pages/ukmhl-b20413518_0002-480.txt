Applied Anatomy: 464 growth, the great size often, the lobulation, the presence of cysts, and unequal consistence of the tumour, as well as the absence of all inflammatory symptoms are suspicious. Double primary malig- nant disease of the testicle is always lymplw-sarcoma. When there is marked lumbar pain, it probably indicates infection of the lymphatic glands in that region. Simple forms of sarcocele are rarely larger than a goose's egg. Gout and malaria may also cause enlargement of the testicle. The following Table (after Erichsen) may assist the memory:â€” Simple Sarcocele, 1. In the acute stage tlie cord is thick and tender ; in chronic, may he enlargedfrom dilated vessels. It is a chronic inflanima- tiou following acnte orchitis, and all parts are affected. 2.

Hydrocele sometimes. 6. Scrotum healthy, and usually only one tes- ticle affected. 1. Vas deferens afiected and cord thickened.

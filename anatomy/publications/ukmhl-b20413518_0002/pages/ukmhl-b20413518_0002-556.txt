540 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER XLVII. TERMS USED IN EYE SURGERY. Abscission.—^Tlie removal of tlie cornea, with, the front part of tlie sclerotic, as for stajjhyloma, leaving the posterior part of the globe, with the muscular attachments, to form a movable stump for an artificial eye. To prevent the escape of the contents of the eye, pass four or five curved needles through the base, with silk ligatures attached, and. then cut off the protruding parts just in front of the needles; the middle needle is then drawn through, and the suture thus left in position tied; and so for the others. In the old form the sutures were difficult to introduce, the contents apt to escape, and a shrunken, iiseless stump left. Amaurosis.—Complete blindness of an eye, Avithout apparent cause. Amblyopia.—Dullness of sight, short of complete blindness, without apparent physical cause, and with little or no ophthal- moscopic change in the fundus. A very common form is from excessive smoking—tobacco amhlyoina—usuallj^ accompanied by a central colour scotoma, especially for the red and green rays. It is scarcely necessary to point out how important this fact is for all persons who have to do with railway, or naval signals. Ametropia.—Any permanent defect in the refraction of the eye. Anchyloblepharon.—Union of the contiguo\is margins of the eyelids. Anisometropia.—Unequal refraction in the tM'o ej^es. Arcus Senilis.—A condition caused by fatty degeneration of the corneal tissue, just within its margin. It forms two crescents, which by-and-by meet; it begins beneath the upper lid, and is a senile change, no matter M'hat the patient's age may be.

Applied Anatomy: 230 CHAPTER XXXV. THE SPINE. At the upper part of the spine we find the Suboccipital triangle. It is situated just below the occipital bone, and has the following boundaries — Above, the superior oblique; 'below, the inferior oblique; internally, the rectus capitis posticus niajor; the roof is formed by the complexus; and the floor is formed by the posterior occipito-atloid ligament and posterior arch of the atlas. The Contents are—(1) The vertebral artery; (2) the sub-occipital nerve; and (3) anastomoses between the profunda cervicis, the princeps cervicis, and the vertebral. To expose this triangle the following muscles must be reflected—(1) The trapezius, (2) the sterno-cleido-mastoid, (3) the splenius capitis, (4) the complexus, and (5) the trachelo-mastoid. The sub-occipital nerve is the undivided posterior primary division of the first cervical nerve, and lies in the groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of the atlas, beneath and behind the A'ertebral artery. It is chiefly a muscular branch supplying the recti and obliqui muscles and the complexus. The great occipital nerve is the enlarged internal branch of the posterior j^rimary division of the second cervical nerve; it passes from the canal bet'\\'een the atlas and the axis, and turns round the lower border of the inferior oblique, covered by the complexus, and pierces the latter muscle and the trapezius near their insertion into the cranium. MUSCLES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND VERTEBRAE AND THE OCCIPITAL BONE. 1. Between the Atlas and the Occipital Bone.—(1) The rectus capitis posticus minor; this muscle arises from the pos- terior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted into the occipital bone. (2) The superior oblictue; it arises from the transverse process of

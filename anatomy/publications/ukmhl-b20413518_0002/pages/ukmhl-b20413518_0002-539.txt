Platysma Myoides.—Arhes from tlie clavicle and acromion, and from the fascia covering the upper jjart of the deltoid, pectoral, and trapezius muscles; the fibres pass upwards and inwards, and are inserted into the lower jaw, angle of the mouth, and cellular tissue of the face, interlacing with many of the facial muscles. The muscle lies immediately beneath the skin, and therefore above the deep fascia. The external and anterior jugular veins, an.d the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, lie just beneath it. Nerves.—The facial and superficial branches of the cervical plexus. The special use of the platysma is probably to assist the venous return from the head and neck. It will be observed that the muscle follows the outline of the neck, so that its points of attachment are above the level of its muscular belly. When, therefore, the muscle contracts, its centre part rises up, like the string of a bow, and so relieves the external and anterior jugulars from pressure, raising up the skin and superficial fascia. 2. Sterno-Cleido-Mastoid.—Arises from the upper and anterior part of the sternum, and posterior surface of the inner third of the clavicle, and is inserted across the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and the outer half of the superior curved line of occipital bone. Nerves.—Spinal accessory and branches from the cervical plexus. In order to find out the relation of this muscle to tumours of the neck, the patient should lie on his back, and then raise the

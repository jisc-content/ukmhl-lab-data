321 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE ABDOMEN — fOontinued). THE SPLEEN. The spleen lies far back in tlie left liypochontlrinm behind the stomacli. Its average size, in tlie adult, is about five inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and an inch or an inch and a half in thickness. It weighs about seven ounces. It is not placed vertically, as is often described, but lies very obli(|uely ; "it is oblique in two directions—viz., from above downwards and outwards, and also from above downwards and forwards" (CuxNiNGHAJi). It lies parallel Avith, and follows the obliquity of, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs ; its " upper" extremity tlierefore points towards, and is not very far removed from, the spinal column. The upper end is attached to the diaphragm by the phrenico-.splenic ligament; by this means, therefore, the organ partakes of the respiratory movements of that muscle— siiddng during inspiration and rising during expiration. This is one valuable aid in the diagnosis of splenic tumours. Its lower end rests on the phrenico-colic (costo - colic) ligament, which, coupled Avitli the natural obliquity of the organ, guides an eidarged spleen in a direction downwards and forwards towards tlie unibiHcus. Tlie outer surface rests against the diaphragm, whicli lies between it and the ribs before mentioned; between tliis surface, therefore, and the skin, we find the peritoneum, diaphragm, jileura covering the upper .surface of the diaphragm, a wedge - sha])ed mass of lung tissue encased by pleura, tlus jileural " cavity," the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs covered witli pleura on their inner surfaces, and, lastly, the soft ])arts of the chest widl.

503 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. the pus passes between the pillars of the diaphragm with the aorta, follows the iliac vessels into the iliac fossa, and points above Poupart's ligament, or passes into the jjelvis along the internal iliac, and from that to the gluteal region along the gluteal artery, through the great sacro-sciatic notch. The source of a psoas abscess is usually spinal caries of the lower dorsal region; also, perinephritic collections of pus, or from an empyema; more rarely, from sacro-iliac disease, or suppuration following a primary psoitis. The Lumbar Plexus of Nerves is placed in the substance of the psoas muscle, and in psoas abscess, therefore, any or all of its branches may be irritated, giving rise to pain in the distribution of the nerve. This is specially the case with the genito-crural nerve, in young persons, the irritation thus caused producing persistent erections of the penis. The branches of the lumbar plexus are:— 3. Genito-crural—Derived from the second and third lumbar nerves. 4. External Cutaneous—Derived from the second and third lumbar nerves. 5. Anterior Crural—Derived from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. 6. Obturator — Derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. The plexus is formed by the first three lumbar nerves, M'ith a part of the fourth. The rest of the fourth and the fifth unite to form the lumbosacral cord. The branches leave the psoas thus:— Anterior Crural ^ Genito-crural—Pierces the anterior surface. Obturator—Pierces the inner border. In Dorsal Abscess, the follows the intercostal arteries and reaches the surface along the posterior branches. It is most often met with in upper and mid dorsal disease. 1. nio-hypogastric 2.

46G Applied Anatomy: inch and a quarter from tlie base of the prostate; at the apex of tliis triangle the prostate gland is situated (Fig. 224). If the puncture be not in the middle line, the vasa deferentia or vesicuhe seniinales may be injured; and unless well forwards towards the apex of the triangle, the peritoneum might be punctured. This operation may be rendered necessary for the retention of urine in cases of stricture of the urethra, or in cases of rupture of the same structure Avhere it is impossible to pass a catheter. The objections to puncture per rectum are—(1) That it is inconvenient to keep a tube in the rectum; (2) that it may cause abscess between the bladder and rectiim, and leave a permanent fistula; (3) the vesiculas seminales or peritoneum may be injured, causing peritonitis; and (4) that it may set up pelvic cellulitis.

Unless the finger can be passed well beyond the prostate, and feel the fluctuating base of the bladder, do not attempt it. The cannula, too, can only be kept in for a limited period per rectum; and further, it cannot be done at all in cases of enlarged prostate, nor in the Negro races (Bell). It may be done in cases of imper- meable stricture in the young adult, or in complete rupture of the urethra. During an extensive experience of nearly half-a-century, Mr Spbnce only performed the operation twice. In performing this simple operation, pass two fingers into the rectum till the base of the prostate and tlio bladder beyond is distinctly felt; the point of puncture must bo in the middle line, and as near the base of the prostate as possible.

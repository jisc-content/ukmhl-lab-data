Haemorrhage is one of tlie chief dangers of internal urethrotomy, at any part of the canal, but especially if the section involve the upper wall of the membranous urethra; here the dorsal vein of the penis may be wounded, or the plexus of Saxtorini, into which it empties (Fenwick). When this happens the blood pours from the prostatic and vesical venous plexuses, as well as from the internal iliac veins, as the valves are very often incompetent. THE PROSTATE GLAND. This gland is situated behind and below the pubes, embraciug the neck of the bladder, and lying against the anterior wall of the rectum, the recto-vesical layer of j^elvic fascia being the only Fig. 220. The Prostate. Tl structure that is interposed between the two. In size and .shape it resembles a chestnut. It is closely connected with the anterior and lateral true ligaments of the bladder (pelvic fascia), which join it at its upper part, and for this reason the anterior ligament is called, at this point, the " pubo-prostatic" ligament. It is this fascial layer that we must on no account pass beyond in making the incision in lateral lithotomy, otherwise the operation will be followed by infiltration of urine into the sub-peritoneal cellular tissue of the pelvis. Between the two pubo-prostatic ligaments is the dorsal vein of the penis. It has also attached to it the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle, these fibres being called, for this reason, the " levator prostati." It consists of three lobesâ€”a median

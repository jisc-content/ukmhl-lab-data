Applied Anatomy: 47G CHAPTEE XLiy. THE P E L V I ^ — (Gontinued). THE RECTUM. The rectum extends from tlie left sacro-iliac synchondrosis, ob- liquely downwards and to the right, to the middle of the sacrum, and then curves forwards and inwards in front of the sacrum and coccyx. From the tijj of the coccyx it continues its course down- wards and forwards for about an inch and a half to the prostate in the male, and back of the cervix, vagina, and perineal body in the female. Opposite the prostate it makes another turn, passing downwards and slightly backwards to the orifice of the anus; the anus is situated about an inch and a half in front of the tip of the coccyx. It will be observed, therefore, that although it is called the " rectum," it is anything but stravjlit in the human subject, although it is so in the lower animals. It should be further noted that the rectum does not pass downwards and backwards from the tip of the coccyx to the anus, but from the hack of tlie prostate—an inch and a half from the tip of the coccyx.* The rectum is divided into three parts—the first part extends from its commencement to the second or third sacral vertebra; the second part, from the second or third sacral vertebra to tlie tip of the coccyx; the third part, from the tip of the coccyx to the anal orifice—this part being about an inch and a half in length. The length of the entire rectum is about eight inches. * As the anus is ahout an inch and a lialf in front of the tip of the coccyx, it is evident that the usual description is, to say the least, misleading.

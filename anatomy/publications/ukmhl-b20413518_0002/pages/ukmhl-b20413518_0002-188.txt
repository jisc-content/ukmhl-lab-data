Applied Anatomy: 172 articulation, the escaped pus easily finds its way up the thigh in the direction named. There is also a third septum interposed between the adductor muscles and the flexor group. In this way the thigh is divided into three fascial compartments, each containing its own group of muscles, and each group of muscles with its special nerve : thus we have the extensor group in front, supplied loy the anterior crural nerve; the adductor group, on the inner side, supplied by the obturator nerve; the flexor group behind, supplied by the great sciatic nerve. Fig. 162. Section of Thigh.—(From Cunninqham.) c Diagram to show how the Tliigh is subdivided into three compartments by its general aponeurotic investment and the three Inter-muscular Septa, which pass inwards from it to tlie Linea Aspera of the Femur. a. Internal Inter-muscular Septum. c. External luter-muscular Septum. h. The third Septum, which is interposed between the Adductor Muscles and the Flexor Muscles. Each compartment contains its own group of muscles, and with each group a particular nerve is associated. The Internal or Long Saphenous Vein.—This vein lies in the subcutaneous tissue, above the deep fascia; it commences on the inner side of the dorsum of the foot, ascends in front of the inner malleolus, and along the inner side of the leg, behind the inner edge of the tibia, and at tlie knee passes hehind the inner condyle of the femur; it then jjasses up the inner side of the thigh, at first following the course of the sartoiius muscle, I)asses through the saphenous opening, and empties itself into the

Applied Anatomy: 170 along the obturator vessels and nerves, to tlie inner side of the thigh, sometinies also into the ischio-rectal fossa, and niaj^ even open into the gut itself. The following are the more important diseased conditions that may cause flexion of the thigh—Psoas abscess and primarj^ psoitis, typhlitis and peri-typhlitis, peri-nephritis and peri-nephritic abscess, inflammation of the bursa under the ilio-psoas tendon, acute inflam- mation of the deep lymphatic glands of the groin, and adhesions of the prepuce to the glans penis in boys. In cases of supposed hip disease these various conditions must be first excluded. In the case of adhesions of the prepuce to glans simulating hip disease the irritation is probably conveyed through the prostatic plexus of the sympathetic—twigs from which just terminate at the corona glandis—to the hypogastric plexus, and thence to the third and fourth lumbar nerves, and from that to the muscles concerned. The conditions that specially cause flexion and abduction of the thigh are—(1) Early stage of hip joint disease; (2) backward dislocations at the hip, and dislocation into the foramen ovale; (3) diseased conditions of the psoas muscle or fascia; and (4) the enlargement of the glands of the groin from diseases of foot or genitals (Chiene). In the female, during pregnancy, the cartilaginous coverings of the sacro-iliac and the pubic articulations become softer and laxer, and a delicate synovial membrane appears, or, if already present, enlarges. DEEP FASCIA OF THE THIGH. The deep fascia of the thigh, from its great extent, is known as the fascia lata. It is attached above to the body of the pubes and pubic arch, Poupart's ligament, the crest of the ilium, and margin of the sacrum and coccyx; it passes downwards, forming a complete sheath for the whole of the thigh, which varies in thickness at different parts, and is firmlij attached below to all the prominent points around tlie knee joint, such as the tuberosities of the femur and tibia, and head of the fibula. After this, it forms the deep fascia of the leg, but there is no direct communication between the sheath of the muscles of the thigh and tliat of tlic muscles of the leg; and, on account of this firm connection of tlie

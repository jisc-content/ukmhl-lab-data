Applied Anatomy: 4 to larynx and pharynx; and (h) pulmonary inflammation, blood poisoning, and exhaustion. If the disease spreads downwards, opening the trachea may not save the patient's life; but it at least saves him from a very distressing kind of death, and it may possibly save his life. Hence, even in cro\ip and diphtheria, opening the windpipe is a perfectly justifiable operation, so long as it gives temj^orary relief or affords the lead chance of saving the patient's life. Besides, the operation of opening the windpipe is not meant to care the cUi<ease, bnt only to get rid of the danger of immediate death from asphyxia, and to red the larynx. In many cases of diphtheria, however, death is not due to asphyxia, but to asthenia, caused by the absorption of the poison into the circulation-—if, indeed, it be not in the blood from the A'ery fii'st— and in this class of cases it would be worse than useless to perform the operation. It is also useless to open it in cases where the obstruction is low down in the trachea; to distinguish this from laryngeal obstruction, the laryngoscope must be employed, and much assistance will be gained by remembering that in laryngeal obstruction the larynx itself moA^es eiiergetically with respiration, ■whereas in tracheal dj^spno^a it is stationary. In the middle line of the Neck we find the following structures (Fig. 120) :—(1) Symphysis of the lower jaw; (2) central tendon of the mylo-hyoid muscles; (3) body of the hyoid bone; (4) thyro- hyoid membrane; (5) thyroid cartilage; (G) crico-thyroid membrane and arteries; (7) cricoid cartilage, which can be distinguished from the rings of the trachea by its more resistant feel; o]iposite this cartilage, as already pointed out, is the " carotid tubercle " of tlic sixth cervical verteljra, and opposite this point also is the usual situation for applying a ligature to tlie common carotid, above the omo-hyoid; (8) two or three rings of the trachea; (9) isthmus of tlie thyroid body (usually crossing about the third or fourtli rings); and (10) the trachea again. The level of the vocal cords corresponds to the middle of tlie anterior margin of the thyroid cartilage (Qualn) ; Gray, however, places the cords on a loM-er level—one quarter of an inch above the lower edge of the cai'tilage. The Position of the Patient.—He is to be placed on a table, facing a good light, and his shoulders are Avell raised liy pillows; llie licixl is tlirown as far bnch as pructicablo, and kept perfectly

216 Applied Anatomy: will be difficulty in respiration wliicli soon becomes abdominal, and crepitus may be detected, eitber by placing tbe band over tbe fractured part and directing tbe patient to take a deep breatli, or by applying the stethoscope. A valuable means of diagnosis is by indirect pressure : tbe Surgeon places one hand on tbe sterniun and the other on the spine, and, on pressing gently, the patient complains of pain at the seat of the fracture; or tbe rib which is believed to be broken may be followed towards tbe spine or sternum as tbe case may be, and when at some distance from the fractured point, pressure is made upon the rib, when the patient will feel pain at the seat of the fracture. This Avill serve to distinguish it from a bruise—which, after all, is of little 'practical importance, as tbe treatment is tbe same in both cases. The signs of lung injury are—(1) Subcutaneous emphysema, and (2) htemoptysis. If the lung tissue be much injured there will be expectoration of frothy, bright red blood, and a constant liacldng cough from irritation of tbe pulmonary branches of the vagus nerve, as the most prominent symptoms. The following are the chief complications likely to arise from wounds of the lung, viz.—(1) Bleeding, especially internal, giving rise to luemotlwrax, and leading to compression of the lung and dyspnosa; (2) emphysevia, an infiltration of air into the cellular tissue, indicated by puffy swelling and crackling when pressed upon; (3) pneumothorax, an accumulation of air in the pleural cavity; (4) htjdrotho7'ax,' an accumulation of serous fluid in the pleural cavity; (5) suppuration and accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity (empyema); (6) there is always a risk of pleurisy and pneumonia; (7) tbe intercostal artery is sometimes ruptured, so that there is hsemorrhage into the cellular tissue. Treatment.—When only one or two ribs are broken, tbe side of the chest should be strapped with plaster. Each strip should be about an inch and a half wide, and long enough to reach about two inches beyond the middle line in front and behind. They may eitber be applied parallel with each other, and partially over- lapping, or they may be crossed in an x -like fashion over the seat of the fracture; they should be applied during expiration, as the object is not so much to steady the fractured ends, but to rest that half of tbe chest and relieve the patient of pain.

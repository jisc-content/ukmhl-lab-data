The two vertical lines are drawn, one on each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the centre of Poupart's ligament, so that they shall be parallel with the middle line of the body. The upper thi'ee regions are called—(a) The right hypochondriac, (&) the epigastric, and (c) the left hypochondriac: the middle three are called—(a) the right lumbar, (h) the umbilical, and (c) the left lumbar: and the lower three are called—(«) The right iliac, (h) the hypogastric, and (c) the left iliac.

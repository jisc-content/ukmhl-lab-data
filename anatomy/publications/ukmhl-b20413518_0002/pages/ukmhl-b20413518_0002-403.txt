Tlie obturator artery usually arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and escapes froiu the pelvis by the uppei- part of the obturator foramen; but this artery sometimes arises from the deep epigastric, and when it does so, it is usually the pubic branch very much enlarged. In order to reach the obturator foramen, it may pass in either of two ilirections—(1) It may pass down close to the vein, and external to the crural ring (Fig. 212), in one out of every four cases (Woou); or (2) it may arch over the crural ruig, and descend internal to it Fig. 212.

(Fig. 213), in about one out of every eighty cases. It is in this latter variety that the danger exists, because in cutting inwards on Gimueknat's ligament, the vessel is also apt to be divided or wounded; but, fortunately, this variety of abnormal distribution of the artery is not very common, and this is all the more fortunate because it is impossible to foresee or avoid the accident. In the diagnosis between this form of hernia and the inguinal form, it is well to remember that the neck of the sac in femoral hernia is situated below Poupaut's ligament, and external to the spine of the pubes; whereas in inguinal hernia the neck of the sac is above Poupaut's ligament, and internal to the pubic spine.

260 Applied Anatomy: pylorus is just to the right of the middle line, near the end of tlie eighth rib, or between two and three inches below the xiphi-sternal articulation: this point also, of course, corresponds to the beginning of the duodenum. Caeliac Axis, between four and five inches above the umbilicus: the superior mesenteric and supra-renal are just below this. Renal Arteries are fully three inches above the umbilicus. Pancreas, about three inches above the umbilicus, and opposite the body of the first lumbar vertebra. Duodenum, crosses the middle line on a level with the third lumbar vertebra, and ascends to the left side of the body of the second liunbar vertebra. Inferior Mesenteric Artery comes off about one inch above the umbilicus. Transverse Colon, lowest part of the arch, is found just above the umbilicus. Umbilicus, corresponds to the level of the disc between the third and fourth lumbar vertebra?, or the third spine behind, or about one inch above the highest points of the iliac crests. Aorta, bifurcates about one inch below and a little to the left of the umbilicus, or on a level with the highest point of the iliac crests. Highest Point of Crests corresponds to the level of the fourtli lumbar vertebra. Promontory of Sacrum, a little below the level of the anterior superior Uiac sjjines. The Small Intestines fill up most of the space below the umbilicus. The Bladder.—Just above the pubes we find the bladder when distended with urine, and the pregnant uterus, after the fourth month. External Abdominal Ring, corresponds to the crest of the pubes— that part between the spine of the pubes and tlie angle or symphysis.

471 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. paiailloma are found in the urine, then perform perineal cystotomy, and use digital exploration. If the presence of a tumour is certain, then open the bladder supra-pubically and remove it, as the perineal incision is too small, except for a small, single tumour. If the tumour be large, or if they arc multiple, they cannot be removed by the perineal incision. If in doubt between tumours and foreign bodies, use the endoscope; to do this the urine must be clear, and free from pus or blood. PYURIA. Pus in the Urine may also be derived from the Urethra, Bladder, or Kidney:— 1. From the Urethra.—Here it is passed before the urine, or escapes independently of micturition. If it come with a gush, it is probably due to the bursting of a prostatic abscess into the urethra, but the pus in this case may also flow back into the bladder. 2. From the Bladder.—The pus is equally diffused through the urine, which is foul-smelling and alkaline; the alkali present renders the pus " ropy," and holds it in suspension. It is usually mixed Avith mucus, and the pus is always present. 3. From the Kidney.—When first passed it may be diffused through the fluid, but it soon settles down into a layer at the bottom of the glass, which is sharply marked off from the super- natant fluid; the urine is acid, not decomposed, and does not contain mucus. In cases where the cause is calculous pyelitis, the appearance of pus will be intermittent—present at one time but absent the next. Note the differences between blood and pus, from the bladder and kidney respectively. Speaking generally— (1) Blood from the bladder is not diffused through the urine, whereas pus is. (2) Blood from the kidney is diffused through the urine, whereas pus is not. (3) Pus in alkaline urine = bladder. Pus in acid urine = kidney. (4) Pus constantly present - bladder. Pus at times only = kidney.

Surgica/, 3fedic<i/, a/id Operative. 305 This operation meets all the objections urged against lumbar colotomy, and also affords a means of exploring the abdomen, in obscure cases, before completing the operation. The objections urged against it are—(1) The greater tendency' to prolapse of the gut, and (2) that it is not suitable for urgent cases, as the peritoneum is opened, and, therefore, faeculent material might reach that cavity. Still, by careful stitching, and the adoption of suitable precautions, the gut may be opened at once, though, no doubt, the operation is best performed in two stages. r r RESUME of the chief steps of the operation of inguinal colotomy:— 1. Take the same precautions, with regard to antiseptics, as in other operations opening into the jjeritoneal cavity —especially with respect to the clothes, hands, and instruments. 2. ^fake the incision. In making the incision, Mr Cripps pulls the skin a little inwards, so that when it is again relaxed the opening through the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum is on a different level; this makes the opening valvular, and it is more easily closed after- wards with a pad. 3. Secure all the bleeding vessels, and then open the peritoneum to nearly the full extent of the external wound. 4. Push the small intestine aside, recognise the large gut by the usual signs, or else pass a finger into the pelvis, find the rectum, and follow it upwards, f). Pull a loop of the gut into the wound, and insert U\o provisional carbolised silk ligatures, two inches apart; they must do little more than go through the peri- toneal coat. These sutures are to steady the bowel during the stitching operations, and afterwards to serve as guides when the bowel is to be opened. G. Now return the loop of bowel, and stitch the parietal peritoneum to the skin at four or five points with fme carbolised silk. *U

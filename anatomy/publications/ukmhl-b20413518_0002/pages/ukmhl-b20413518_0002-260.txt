Applied Aiuitoiiiy: The Spinal Cord is protected from injury by—(1) The ctuvcs of the spine, which deaden the shock and hreak up the force; (2) the chistic inter-vertebral discs, -which act like bnfl'ers; (3) tlie general flexibility of tlie spine, so that it can give to a certain extent without breaking; {\) the small amount of movement at any one point; (6) the wide size of the canal, and the small size of the cord, together with its central position; (G) the gap left between the membranes and the bone; and (7) the fluid in the membranes and the mooring of the cord in the centre of this canal of fluid by the ligamentum denticulatum, so that it is but little affected by the movements of the spine. The cord, as such, stops at the lower border of the lirst lumbar vertebra; its lower part is protected by the tough "cauda equina." The membranes, however, pass as far down as the second sacral vertebra, and inflammation therefore might easily spread up from this point. The parts most apt to be injured are—(1) The atlo-axoid region, because it is so near the skull, and because at the foramen magnum the cord with its membranes fill tlie canal; (2) the cei-vico-dorsal region, because here the flexible cervical joins the inflexible dorsal part; and (3) the dorso-lumbar region, for the same reason, and also because it is near the centre of the column, and hence there is great leverage above and below this point. FRACTURE-DISLOCATION OF THE SPINE. It is wise in all cases of supposed fi'acture of the spine not lu make too sure of the diagnosis, lest during manipulation we displace tlic bones and crush the cord. In dislocation of the first vertebra from the second, or in fracture of the odontoid process, the patient will necessarily die at once, or, at the latest, in but a fcAv minutes, ;is the odontoid process, or else the arch of the axis, presses on the medulla destroying the respiratory and cardiac centres. So also in any fracture-dislocation above the origin of the phrenic nerves (chiefly from the fourth and fifth) the patient usually dies in a few minutes. Below this point, say between the fifth and the sixth, or the sixth and the seventh, the patient may live a few days, but with everything below the injured point paralysed—arm, log, abdominal muscles, bladder and bowel, etc.,—though at tlie same time the intellect remains clear. The breathing is entirely

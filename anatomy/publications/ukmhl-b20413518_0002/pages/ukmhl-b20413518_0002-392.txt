876 Applied Anatomy: OTHER VARIETIES OF INGUINAL HERNIA. 1. Congenital, or hernia in the sac of the tunica vaginalis; the tcndencij is congenital, not the disease. The hernia in this case lies inside the tunica vaginalis, and therefore in contact with, and completely enveloping, the testicle, so that that organ cannot ho distinctly felt, separate from the tumour; it is always ohliquc, and takes the same course as the testicle. It is always suddenly produced as the sac is pre-formed, extending into the scrotum at once; and further, the neck is very long and narrow, passing up into the abdomen obliquely. This form of hernia is often found along with congenital j^himosis, preputial adhesions, or a very narrow meatus; it is therefore necessary to attend to these points Fig. 201. Condition of the Processus Vaginalis In Congenital Hernia, first, and it is a good plan alwai/s to examine tlic child's penis in cases of hernia, and for many other diseased conditions, such as apparent hip disease. Always examine the scrotum also, to liiul out whether both testicles are down. The possibility of its occur- ence is due to the fact that the process of peritoneum (2)rorc>isns LXKjinalis), which passes down before the testicle into the scrotum, has not become obliterated, as in the normal condition, but remains open (Fig. 201) and thus serves as a medium of communication between the general cavity of the peritoneum and the tunica vaginalis, through Avhich the congenital hernia descends. It is very apt to be strangulated, as the neck is long and narrow, Avith a tendency to become longer and narroAver, and when it is

198 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTEE XXXIV. THE CHEST. Relation of the Heart to the Chest Wall.—(Fig. 170).—The base of the heart lies a little below the level of the second costal cartilages; a line representing it, therefore, would be drawn at this level, a little obliquely from right to left, and extending half- an-inch to the right side of the sternum, but an inch and a half to the left of the same bone. The highest j^ortion of the heart is formed by the appendix of tlie left auricle, which reaches as high as the lower border of the second costal cartilages, or the upper part of the second space. The next point to mark is the " apex beat"; this is situated between the fifth and the sixth ribs, about three and a half inches to the left of the mid-sternal line, or fully two inches from the left margin of the sternum: it is close to the upper margin of the sixth rib (the usual stereotyped and rather loose descrijjtion is—an inch and a half below, and one inch internal to the nipple). It is well to note that in the normal condition the "apex beat" should be weU wUhin the left "nipple line." The right border is almost entirely formed by the right auricle; to indicate it, a line must be drawn from the right end of the base line in the second space, and gently curved with tlie convexity to the right side, to about the junction of the fifth costal cartilage with the sternum. The lower border (margo acidus) is formed for the most part by the right ventricle, and is indicated by a line drawn from the junction of the fifth right costal cartilage with the sternum, through the xipbi-sternal articulation, to half- an-inch beyond the apex beat. The left border (margo ohtiisus) is formed by the left ventricle, and may be indicated by a line drawn from half-an-inch outside the apex beat to the left extremity of the base line in the second space. The greater part of the anterior

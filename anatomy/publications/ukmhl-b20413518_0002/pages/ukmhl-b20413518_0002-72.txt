In less marked cases Ave may adopt Langenbeck's plan of levering up the muco- periosteal tissue with an elevator and making the flaps from the two sides meet across the gap. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to make liberating incisions along the inner side of the alveolus, taking care that they do not go back beyond the last molar tooth or forward beyond the canine tooth, lest the anterior

301 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. By using tins incision we have well-marked anatomical guides, both in the superficial and deep parts of the wound—the edge of the erector spin* in the one, and the edge of the quadratus lumborum in the other. It is the centre of this latter muscle that we first reach; but by working a little forwards, its edge is reached and can readily be drawn inwards, or if it is specially well developed, it may be partially divided. The objections to lumbar colotomy are—(1) The space is small; (2) it is often difficidt to identify the bowel, and this has led, in some cases, to opening the duodenum (on ■ the right side), other parts of the small intestine, and even the stomach; (3) the wound is often deep, so that it is impossible to stitch the bowel to the skin without undue tension; (4) occasional, or even frequent abnor- malities of the colon, and failure to find it at all; and (5) the patient is unable to attend to the artificial anus himself. In performing the operation of colotomy, it is necessary to avoid—(1) Wounding the peritoneum; (2) allowing the contents of the gut to become effused into the areolar tissue of the wound; and for this purpose, in cases where the gut must be opened at once, a wide india-rubber tube should be introduced into the opening, to allow the contents to escape gradually through it. After this, the sides of the opening in the gut are stitched to the sides of the incision, as already described under the first form of incision. The operation may be rendered necessary on account of—(1) Malignant stricture of the rectum with tenesmus, such as from cancer; (2) other strictures, such as from pressure of a pelvic tumour; (3) imperforate anus or other congenital defects; (4) volvulus of the sigmoid flexure, as the incision in laparotomy is too small to allow of the large coil being dealt with properly; (5) in all forms of vesico-intestinal fistula; (6) sometimes in cases of very painful non-malignant stricture of the rectum, to rest the part for a time and allow it to heal; and (7) in cases of cancer of the neck of the uterus opening into the rectum. By performing this operation in the same way on the opposite side, the caput ctecum, or ascending colon, may be reached. As already stated, however, an artificial anus should not, if possible, be made in this situation, on account of the fluid nature of the faeces at this part of the gut.

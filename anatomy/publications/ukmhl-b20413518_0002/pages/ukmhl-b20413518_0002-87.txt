Siirgica/, Medical, and Operative. 71 convolution. It will be seen, therefore, that this vessel supplies the most important parts, both inside and on the surface of the brain, including the motor areas, and other parts concerned in apoplexy. The posterior cerebral supplies the parts not included in the above list. Emboli usually pass to the left side of the brain, except in those cases -where the clot comes from a right carotid aneurism, Fig. 144, The Internal Capsule. Aliddle Line. Nucleus Caudatus. Internal Capsule (anterior part). Genu. Optic Thalamus. .Intenial Capsule (posterior part). This has been explained by the fact that the left common and internal carotids are almost in a direct line with the first part of the arch of the aorta, and are thus in the direct main stream, and hence the embolus is washed into this vessel rather than the other large branches of the arch (Fig. 143). The arteries of the brain readily burst from disease, because they have no sheath, and the outer coat is thin; in other arteries (except the fir.4; part of the aorta), the sheath and outer coat adhere and resist rupture.

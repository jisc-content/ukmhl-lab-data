As regards their origin from the cord, the upper three cervical arise opposite the first two vertebrae; the other five cervical arise about one vertebra higher ujd than their points of exit from the canal. The dorsal nerves at the upper part are also about a vertebra higher up, but as we pass down the distance increases to one and a half and then to two, so that the eleventh dorsal spine corresjjonds to the first lumbar nerve; all the others are crowded opposite the twelfth dorsal and the first lumbar vertebroe. To put it shortly, it may be stated generally that— 1. The eight cervical nerves are found between the occiput and the sixth cervical spine. 2. The six upper dorsal are found between the seventh cervical and the fourth dorsal spine. 3. The six lower dorsal are found between the fifth and the tenth dorsal spines. 4. The five lumbar nerves arise opposite the eleventh and twelfth dorsal spines. 5. The five sacral arise opposite the first lumbar spine. According to Thorburn, the arrangement of the muscular nuclei of the cervical, or brachial, enlargement of the spinal cord is the following:— Supra-spinatu.s ami infra-spinatus, Teres minor ('!), jRicnps, t Bracliialis anticus, Deltoid, jSupinator lougus, ISufiinator brevis (?), Subscapularis, Pronators, Teres majoi', Latissinnis dorsi, Poctoralis major, 1 Triceps, ISemitus magmis, Extensors nf the wrist Flexors of the wrist, Interossei, Otlior intrinsic muscles of the hand, 4th Cervical Nerve. 5th Cervical Nerve. ycth Cervical Nerve. 7th Cervical Nerve. 8th Cervical Nerve. 11 st Dorsal Nerve,

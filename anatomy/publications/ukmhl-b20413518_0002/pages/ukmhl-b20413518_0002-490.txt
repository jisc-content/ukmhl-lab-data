Applied Anatomy: 474 (h) Dissolve in hydrochloric acid, and add ammonia in slight excess. White precipitate of the mixed phosphates thrown down. 6. Oxalate of Lime— (a) Dissolve in hydrochloric or nitric acid, and add ammonia. White precipitate, insoluble in acetic acid. (Z>) It is insoluble in acetic acid. (c) Ignite a portion. Carbonic oxide is given off, and car- bonate of lime left behind. To this add hydrocliloric acid, which will produce copious effervescence. (d) Dissolve in hydrochloric acid, neutralise with am- monia, and add ammonium oxalate. White pre- cipitate of calcium oxalate. Coccygeal Body.—This is a body about the size of a small pea, in close connection with the terminal twigs of the middle sacral artery. Luschka named it the coccygeal gland; but Aenold has shown that it is not a gland, but that it simj^ly consists of the dilated and tortuous twigs of the middle sacral artery. The muscular coat of the artery is much thickened, and there are also layers of peculiar cells. The body is invested by connective tissue, in which nerve cells are embedded. Branches of the ganglion impar of the sympathetic pass to the coccygeal body. A body of similar structure, called the inter-carotic body, is situated in the angle of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery in the neck. Luschka termed this body the ganglion caroticum. It has been thought that many of the congenital sacro- coccygeal tumours may originate in this body. Tliese tumours are fibro-cystic in nature, and are often attached to the bone or to the pelvic viscera; they have no relation to spina bifida, as they originate between the coccyx, or sacrum, and the rectum, and below the levator ani. On account of their deep connections they are very difficult to remove, and should not be interfered with rashly. They consist of closed round vesicles, simple, branched, or varicose, lined by round or polygonal cells, resting on a base- ment membrane; in the ftetus the cells are columnar and ciliated.

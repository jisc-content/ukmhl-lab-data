259 Surg'ical, Aledical, and Operative. aorta, the bifurcation of the trachea, the origin of the innominate artery (over the middle of the sternum), also the origin of the left common cai'otid and left subclavian arteries: at its right side is the "aortic area"â€”^junction of second right costal cartilage with the sternum. Space below Second Rib corresponds to the level of the base of the heart. Third Left Costal Cartilage: at its junction with the sternum is the " pulmonary area " and position of pulmonary valves, and behind this, aortic valves and beginning of the aorta. Tliird Intercostal Space: opposite this point, about one incli to the left of the sternum, we find the mitral valves, but not the " mitral area:" the mitral valves are the deepest (furthest back) of all the valves of the heart. Fourth Costal Cartilages: near this level we find the "tricuspid area" and the tricuspid valves: at this point the anterior edge of the left lung leaves the sternum, exposing the anterior wall of the heart. Over or just below the fourth costal cartilages we find the nipple in the male. Fifth Left Space, apex of heart about three and a half inches to tlie left of the middle line. Sixth Costal Cartilage, lower level of the anterior edge of the right lung. Seventh Left Cartilage, cardiac orifice of the stomach is just behind this, about one inch to the left of the sternum. Xiphi-Sternal Articulation, on a level with the ninth dorsal vertebra; it corresponds also to the lower border of the heart (margo acutus), the central tendon of the diaphragm, and the upper border of the liver in the middle line. Ninth Right Costal Cartilage; at this point the fundus of the gall bladder comes nearest the surface, close to the edge of the right rectus (right liuea semilunaris). Tip of Xiphoid Cartilage is on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra. Lower Edge of Liver, midway between the xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus : just below this is the stomach, and the

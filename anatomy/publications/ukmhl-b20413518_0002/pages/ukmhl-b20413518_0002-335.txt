319 Surgical, Medical, and Operative, RESUME of the chief steps of this operation:— 1. Make an oblique incision over the most prominent part of the tumour, parallel with, and a little below, the costal margin. '1. Dissect carefully through the abdominal wall till the peritoneum is exposed, and then carefully arrest all bleeding vessels. After this— 3. Open the peritoneum and expose the fundus of the gall bladder, introduce a finger along the bladder and its duct, to make sure of the diagnosis. \. Grasp the bladder by forceps, and pull it well into the wound; so arrange that the contents will flow out of, and not into, the peritoneal cavity, and then tap to draw off the collected fluid. 5. Holding the bladder still well up in the wound, Ijy means of a large curved needle, insert four or six carbolised silk stitches, at a little distance from the edge of the incision, into the wall of the gall bladder, but, if possible, not entering its cavity, so as to avoid leakage along the stitches. This outer row of sutures is to secure a broad attachment of the peritoneal sur- faces round the edges of the wound. After this the incision in the abdominal wall may be narroM'ed dowa as far as necessary. 6. Open the gall bladder by scissors in the middle of the exposed portion, and stitch the edges of the opening thus made to the skiji margin of the abdominal wound by a close row of radiating stitches; these stitches protect the external wound. 7. Put in a finger and gently clear out the stones as far as possible; in cases where they are impacted near the cystic duct, rather leave alone than use force, lest you cause perforation. H. Drain if necessary, dust with line boracic powder, wwA dress in the usual niaiiiuM'.

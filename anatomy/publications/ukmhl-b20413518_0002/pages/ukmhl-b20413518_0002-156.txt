//pplicd A natoiiiy: 14,0 insertion of the pectoralis niinoi-, wlicre it forms its three cords. The three cords are formed thus:—The fifth and sixth unite to form a single trunk; the seventh passes down alone; the eighth cervical and the first dorsal unite to form another trunk. The three cords formed in this manner then divide each into an anterior and posterior branch; the anterior branches of the upper and middle join to form the outer cord; the anterior branch of the lower forms the in7ier cord, while the posterior branches all unite to form the jiosterior cord. Its branches are divided into (a) supra-clavicular, and (h) infra-clavicular. The Supra-Clavicular branches are:—(1) Communicating to the phrenic (from the fifth); it joins the phrenic on the scalenus anticus. (2) JSTerve to rhomboids (from fifth). (3) Xerve of Bet,!., by two heads (from the fifth and sixth). (4) The supra-scapular, from the posterior part of the cord formed by the fifth and sixth. (5) Iserve to the subclavius, from the anterior jiart of the cord formed by the fifth and sixth, and which passes down, in front of the third part of the subclavian, to the muscle. The Infra-Clavicular branches are:— From the outer cord— (1) External anterior thoracic. (2) Outer head of median. (3) Musculo-cutaneous (perfomns Gasserii). From the inner cord— (1) Internal anterior thoracic. (2) Inner head of median (3) Ulnar. (4) Internal cutaneous, (5) Lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg). The nerve of Wrisberg is joined by the intercosto-humeral nerve—which is the undivided lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal, usually; occasionally, however, there is some- times an intercosto-humeral nerve from the third intercostal. Prom the posterior cord— (1) Musculo-spiral. (2) Circumflex. (3) The three subscapular nerves.

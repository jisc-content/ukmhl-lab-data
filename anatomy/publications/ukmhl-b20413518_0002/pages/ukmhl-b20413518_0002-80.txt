64 Applied Anatomy: cerebral sinuses. Malignant facial carbuncle usually commences in the lip, and has a special tendency to attack young adults. The facial vein is specially liable to be affected in simple septic or specific infective inflammations, as carbuncle, cancruni oris, and malignant pustule, and lead to serious or fatal results. The walls of this vein do not collapse so readily as those of most superficial veins; it is destitute of valves, and communicates with the cerebral sinuses on the one hand, and the internal jugular vein on the other, and thus every facility is afforded for the absorption and diffusion of septic products. A blow with a blunt weapon, at right angles to the bone, may produce a wound with apparently clean-cut edges, just like Fig. 141. The Scalp. 1. The Skin. 4. Layer of loose Cellular Tissue 2. Superficial Fascia, \vitli Vessels —" dangerous area." and Nerves. 5. Pericranium. 6. Tlie Bone. 3. Tendon of Occipito-frontalis. 7. Dura mater. 8. Brain. an ordinary incised wound ; the difference is, that Avith the blunt instrument, hair-bulbs are found projecting from the surface, and the wound wiU not heal by the first intention, as slight sloughing Avill be produced; Avhereas, with a sharp instrument the hair- bulbs are cut across, and with a magnifying-glass the edges are seen to be perfectly clean-cut, and the wound will jjrobably heal by the first intention. Between the grey matter on the surface of the brain and the outside, the following Structures intervene (Fig. 141):—1. The Scalp, consisting of—(a) The skin; (/>) the superficial fascia, with fatty tissue and the arteries and nerves of,the scalp; (c) the

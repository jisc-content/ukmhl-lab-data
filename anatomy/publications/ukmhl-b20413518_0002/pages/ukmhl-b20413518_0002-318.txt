Applied Anatomy: 302 r r BESUME of left lumbar colotomy (oblique incision):— 1. Place the patient on the right side, with a pillow beneatli the flank, to increase the space between the last rib and the iliac crest. 2. Measure straight from the anterior to the posterior s\iperior iliac spine, and draw a vertical line up to the costal margin a little behind the mid point of this measurement: or the outer edge of the erector spinae may be taken as the guide to the position of the gut. 3. Make an oblif^ue incision, of which this line, or edge of the muscle, is the centre, through skin and deep fascia. 4. Then divide the external oblique at the anterior part, and the latissinius dorsi at the posterior part of the incision, and after this, the external oblique. This now exposes— 5. The posterior surface of the fascia lumborum, which is then opened like the sheath of an artery, and divided by a probe-pointed bistoluy to the full extent of the external incision. In so doing, the last dorsal nerve and artery are divided—secure the artery at once. 6. Divide the middle layer of the tendon of origin of the transversalis muscle, exposing the quadratus lumborum which should be turned aside or notched if in the way. After that open the anterior lamella of the tendon of origin of the transversalis muscle. 7. Hold the edges of the wound apart by two copper spatulse, tease through some fatty tissue often met with at this stage, thus exposing— 8. The fascia transversalis, which should be opened at the posterior part of the wound, the extra-peritoneal fat teased through, when the gut should now be reached. 9. The gut, if distended, will usually project into the wound, if not, inject air or fluid, or take the loAver end of the kidney as the guide to its position, or turn

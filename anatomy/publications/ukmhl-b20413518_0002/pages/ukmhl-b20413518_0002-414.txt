Applied Anatomy: 898 tliis it is firmly blended with the i^iscia lata of the thigh; behind, it Lends round the transverse perineal muscle, and is attached tu the base of the triangular ligament of the urethra; in front, it is i;nattached, and is continuous with the fascia of the scrotum and penis; and in this way a pouch is formed, which is open above,, in the interval between the symphysis pubis and the pubic sjune. From the median line an incomplete septum projects downwards towards the urethra and into the scrotum. From the above attachments, it is evident that the extravasated urine cannot pass backwards into the posterior half of the perineum—that is, the posterior half of the anatomical perineum, or ischio-rectal fossa— because of its attachment to the base of the triangular ligament; nor down the thighs, because of its attachments to the pubic arch and fascia lata of the thigh; but it -will fill the pouch and pass into both sides of the scrotum, and then pass up the front of the abdomen, along the spermatic cord: and even when it has reached the abdomen it is still unable to pass down the thighs, because the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the abdomen is firmly attaclied to Poupart's ligament, nor can it pass the linea alba for a like reason. In cases also of " perineal abscess" the pus spreads in this same fascial compartment, and during the acute stage causes great suffering, both because of the dense fascia, and also pi-essure upon the three long scrotal nerves which lie in this " pouch." To treat this condition a free and deep incision should be made in the middle line of the perineum, from the lowest part of the perineal swelling forwards to the root of the scrotum ; some, instead of making a single median incision, make two lateral incisions. Similar incisions must also be made into the scrotum, in the middle line of the abdomen, and along Poui'art's ligament, if necessary, and, in fact, wherever the urine has infiltrated; the fijiger also should be introduced into the incisions and septa broken down, so as to ensure free drainage. Over all place a large charcoal poultice. Thus far in the dissection we have simply removed—(1) The skin; (2) the superficial fascia; and wheii the pouch above men- tioned is opened into, we come to (3) the long scrotal nerves— (c() anterior superficial perineal, {h) posterior superficial perineal,

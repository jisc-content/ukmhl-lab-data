Surgical, Medical, and Operative. G3 vertebral: behind the ear, a large vein passes through the mastoitl foramen to the lateral sinus: on the vertex, another vein passes through the parietal foramen to the superior longitudinal sinus: on the face, at the inner angle of the orbit, the angular artery and vein anastomose with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery and ophthalmic vein, and other branches of the ophthalmic artery anastomose with the middle meningeal. There are other communications through the anterior and posterior condyloid foramina, foramen ovale, foramen lacerum posticum, and most other openings at the base. Leeches may be applied at many of these parts to relieve congestion of the brain. Another important communication exists between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus (besides the one through the orbit) through the pterygoid plexus, a plexus formed by the middle meningeal vein, deep temporals, pterygoids, masseteric, buccal and inferior dental, and which is situated between the external pterygoid and temporal muscles, and partly between the two pterygoids themselves, and is connected on the one hand with the facial vein and on the other with the cavernous sinus through the foramen Vesalii. The Veins of the diploc are four in number—the frontal, which opens into the supra-orbital veinj the anterior temjjoral, which opens into one of the deep temporal veins; the posterior teraporal, which ends in the lateral sinus; and the occipital, which is the largest of the four, and which opens either into the occipital vein or into the occipital sinus. The walls are formed only of epithelium resting upon a little elastic tissue, and have many c«/.s' de sac. These communications between the external vessels and those of the diploc, and also of the latter, with the sinuses of the dura mater, explain the great danger of erysipelas and other inflammatory conditions, such as carbuncle (especially " malignant facial carbuncle"), attacking the face and scalp, and all tlic more so in cases where there is, or has been, an open wound, and probably therefore septic matters have gained an entrance. The inflammation causes thrombosis in some of the venous trunks, usually the facial; these thrombi probably are, or soon become, septic, break down, and give origin to minute septic emboli, which spread widely and give rise to all the signs of pyiemia. Or the inflammation may pass directly backwards along the veins to tlie

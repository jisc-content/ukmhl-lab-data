458 Applied A iiatoiny: at tlie upper and lower parts only, leaving the central part un- obliterated; this condition is simply an arrest of a natural process. Normally, the processus first closes at its upper part, and next at its lower part, and finally in the intervening portion. Encysted hydrocele of the cord may also be a dilated portion of the tube of the " organ of Giraldes," or sometimes a cyst formed by effusion into the cellular tissue. The proper form is usually found in the child and on the r'njlit side, as this side is the last to close, and hence all congenital defects of this nature are more common on this side. The fluid often contains spermatozoa; the swelling is cylindrical, its upper end being as large as the lower, and the testicle is readily felt below, and is quite distinct from the swelling.

Encysted Hydrocele of the Epididymis.—It may contain pure serum, but is more usually serum with a mixture of seminal fluid. The cyst is usually attached to the head of the epididymis; it may be pedunculated and form a "loose body" in the tunica vaginalis. This form does not surround the testicle, nor has it the shape of the tunica vaginalis; it is tense and globular, and the testicle is in front, or to one or other side, or below. Its origin is doubtful: it may be (1) from the vasa efferentia; (2) an enlarge- ment of the "Hydatid of Morgagni," which is the remains, in the male, of the duct of Muixbb ; (3) the organ of Giraldes— the remains of the 'VVolfrian body, or its duct, the vas aberrans; and (4) from Kobelt's tubes. This condition corresponds to the j)arovarian cysts in the female. At first the fluid may not contain

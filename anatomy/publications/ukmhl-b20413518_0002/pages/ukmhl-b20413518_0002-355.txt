Br this term is meant a protrusion of a part of the viscera through some weak point in the abdominal wall; it is generally through some natural canal or opening, either actual or potential, which has become dilated: it may also take place through adventitious apertures, due to the separation of aponeixrotic fibres from dis- tension of the abdomen. A Hernia consists of a sac (tliat is the prolongation of the peritoneum which envelops the hernia), contents, and coverings. The coverings of any hernia consist of skin, fascia, muscles, and fat. Hernia is said to be inguinal when it comes through the opening or canal situated in the inguinal region of the groin; and Jtmoral when it comes through the opening or canal situated in the femoral region of the groin. The sac has its necU or narrow 2)art situated in the ring. The life history of the neck consists of three stages—(1) Its formation, when it is simply a corrugated oi' folded membrane; (2) its adhesion, where the folds adhere, and it becomes, more or less, a round hole; and (3) its contraction, where the adherent tissue contracts like ordinary fibrous adhesions. In all herniic there is a swelling in communication with the abdominal cavity, and which has been suddenly or gradually produced; if it has appeared mdditnlij the sac must have been pre-l'ornied, as in the different forms of "congenital" hernia. Patliological Varieties.—A hernia is said to be reducible when all tlie contents can be pushed back into the abdominal cavity. It is called irreducible when all the contents cannot be returned witliout tlie sac, and yet is neither strangulated nor obstructed; it may be wholly or partially irreducible. An obstructed hernia

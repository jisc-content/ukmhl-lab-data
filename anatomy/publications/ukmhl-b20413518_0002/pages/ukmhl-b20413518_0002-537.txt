Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 521 to an assistant, who keeps them well on the strain, so as to prevent the loose knot from slipping, the reason of this being that, should there be any bleeding, and any necessity for further constriction, I could secure this in a moment, without undoing any knot, and the simplicity of this method greatlj'^ commends it. I then make a small opening in the uterus, and enlarge it by tearing with my two forefingers, seize the child by a foot, and remove it. I then remove the placenta, and by that time the uterus has completely contracted, and is easily drawn through the wound in the abdo- minal wall. The constricting tv;be will now probably require to be tightened, and the second hitch of the knot may be put on at the same time, and the work is practically done. Stufl' a few sponges into the wound to keep the cavity clear of blood, and pass the knitting needles through the flattened tube and through the cervix, and in this simple way a clamp of the inost efficient kind is at once made. The uterus is removed about three-quarters of an inch above the rubber tube. The usual stitches are put in, the wound closed round the stump, which, of course, is brought to the lower part of the opening, and then the stump is dressed with perchloride of iron in the usual way." The Chief Steps of this operation, then, are:â€” 1. Making the abdominal incision. 2. To open the uterus. 3. To extract the child. 4. To draw the emptied uterus out of the abdomen. 5. To transfix and ligature the uterus, just below the os internum, by Koeberle's >^erri'-im)id, or you may use Keith's or Tait's clamp. If the elastic ligature is used, it must be passed after making the abdominal incision. G. Next amputate tlie uterus, with tlie ovaries and tubes, about three-quarters of an iiicli above tlie ligature, or 7. Fix the stump at the lower angle of the abdominal wound, and dress with perchloride of iron. 8. Close the a})dominal wound around tlie stumj) in tlie usual way.

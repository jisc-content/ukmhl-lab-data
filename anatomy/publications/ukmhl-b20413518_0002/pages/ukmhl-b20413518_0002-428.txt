Applied Aiuxtomy: 412 The Surgeon now passes liis finger into tlie rectum to ascertain the depth of the perineum, by feeling the apex of the prostate and membranous portion of the urethra, to see that the rectum is empty, and also to make it contract to its fullest possible extent, "which will keep it out of the way. The fingers of the left hand are then laid on the left side of the perineum, to steady it while the first incision is being made. The knife is entered one-third of an inch to the left of the median raphe, an inch and a quarter in front of the anus, so as not to cut the artery to the bulb, and is carried downwards and outwards for about three inches to a point between the anus and the tuberosity of the ischium, but rather nearer to the tuberosity than it is to the anus. The deepest part of this incision should be towards the upper part, near tlie base of the triangular ligament, just between the erector penis covering the crus, and the accelerator urina) covering the bulb, or fully a quarter of an inch from the upper end of the incision, and must become shallower and shallower as it passes dowmvards into the ischio-rectal fossa. The point of the knife should strike the staff as it lies between the "two layers" of the triangular ligament, in the membranous portion of the urethra. In making this incision, Professor Chiene keeps his finger in the rectum, all the time resting on the apex of the prostate, while he steadies the tissues outside Avith his thumb; there is no doubt but that by this means the depth of the perineum and the situation of the stafi^ in the membranous urethra can be more easily kept in the mind's eye, and that, therefore, the first incision is more safely and correctly made. 13y the first incision we divide â€”(1) The skin: (2) superficial fascia, opening into the pouch formed by the fascia of Colles j (3) the inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves; (4) probably some of the branches of the long scrotal nerves; (5) the transversus perinei muscle; (6) the lower border of tlie anterior layer of the triangular ligament; and (7) the membranous urethra surrounded by the compressores uretlnw muscles. The left forefinger is then to bo passed into the wound, to see that the staff is reached, and to protect the rectum if it is found necessary to enlarge or clear the incision to reach the staff; then the nail of that finger is placed in the "roove in such a Avny that the dorsal surface of the finger

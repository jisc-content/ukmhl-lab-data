The intra-pavietal jiasure is situated between the ascending parietal convolution and the angular gyrus. The Parieto-Occipital Fissure is from a half to three-quarters of an inch in front of the lambda; it partly se^jaratcs the imrietal from the occipital lobe. The Lobes of the Brain.—The frontal lobe is placed in front of the fissure of Eolando, and below is bounded by the anterior end of the fissure of Syr.vius; the parietal lobe is boirnded in front by the fissure of Eolaxuo, behind by the parieto-occipital fissure, Fig. 147.

Behind this point is placed the occipital lobe, while below the fissure of Sylviu8 lies the temporo-sphenoidal lobe; and deep in the li.ssure of Sylviuh, hidilen by tlie oi)er(ndum, is the island of Reil. Tliat ])art of the brain in fmnt of the motor areas is believed to be the p.sycho- logical region, and is therefore beyond the reach of experimental research. The part behind the motor areas is, in a general way, the .sensory region. The sight centre is situated in the iimjnlar (/!/>'>'■" (Fkuiueh), or the contiguous occipital lobe (JMunk); the auditory centre is iu the superior lemporo-.sphenoidal convolution;

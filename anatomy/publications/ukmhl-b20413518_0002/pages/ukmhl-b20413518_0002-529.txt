Surgical, Medical, and Operative. \vheu ho performed this operation, was to bring on a premature menopause; experience, however, has since shown that it does not do so. The operation may be performed :— I. Through the Vagina— 1. An incision is made in the posterior vaginal wall, behind the cervix, and in the middle line, for about an inch and a half. 2. The peritoneal cavity is then opened and the ovary hooked down, either by the finger or polypus forceps. 3. The pedicle is then ligatured close to the hilus with fine carbolised silk and the ovary cut off. The other ovary is treated in the same way. 4. Pass a drainage tube, close the Avound if thought neces- sary, and irrigate twice daily with a weak antiseptic solution. II. They may also bo removed through an opening in the Abdomen— 1. Make an opening into the abdomen, as in ovariotomy. 2. Pass in the fingers and feel for the fundus of the uterus, and then follow the Fallopian tube till the ovary is reached. 3. Draw the ovary out, transfix the broad ligament with fine carbolised silk, and ligature near the hilus; and tlien cut the pedicle about half-an-inch to the ovary side of the ligature, and remove the ovary. Treat the other ovary in the same way. See that there is no bleeding from the pedicle before it is dropped into the abdomen. 4. Close the incision as in ovariotomy. TAIT'S OPERATION.

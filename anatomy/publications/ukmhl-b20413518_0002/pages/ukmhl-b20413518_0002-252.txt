^36 Applied Anatomy: 8. The anterior nerve-roots of the spinal nerves. 9. The motor nerves. 10. The muscles. Sensory Path:— 1. The end organs in the sldn. 2. The sensory nerves. 3. The posterior nerve-roots and ganglia of the spinal nerves, some entering the grey matter at once, others only entering it after they have passed through the postero-external column (Burdach's). 4. The postero-internal column of the opposite side, pro- bably the direct cerebellar, and Hadden and Gower's tract; the sensory fibres decussate almost as soon as they have entered; those for pain and temperature decussate at once, those for touch a little after they have entered, and the fibres for the muscular sense decussate in the medulla. 5. The fasciculus cuneatus (restiform hotly), the fasciculus gracilis (posterior pyramid), and probably the fasci- culus teres of the medulla. 6. The formatio reticularis or deep longitudinal fibres of the pons, and the corresponding part of the crura (= the tegmentum). 7. The optic thalamus, partly. 8. The posterior third of the posterior division of the internal capsule. 9. The fibres of the corona radiata. 10. Sensory centres on the surface of the brain. Effects of Lesions.—Now, suppose there is a lesion involving both motor and sensory paths, anywhere above the medulla—say, at the internal capsule, the usual seat,—^the result will be loss of both motion and sensation, and hoth on the opposite side of the body to the brain lesion; this is because both motor and sensory fibres cross to the opposite side between their point of origin and termination, the motor in the medulla, the sensory in the cord. In a lesion below the medulla—say, of one-half of the spinal

362 Applied Anatomy: tissue at riglit angles to the line of incision, and trans- fixing it, with the back of the knife towards the sac; secure the superficial external pudic artery. In cases of gangrene, or where the parts are much matted by inflammatory action, this method cannot be followed, and one must dissect carefully downwards in the usual manner. 3. Now divide the aponeurosis of the external oblique by opening it at the lower part, and then extending the incision to the full extent of the skin Avound, by a probe- pointed bistoury, througli the inter-columnar fascia. â– 4. Next open the cremasteric fascia, by raising it mth a pair of dissecting forceps, making a small opening in it, as if it were the sheath of an artery; then introduce a flat director, and slit it and the edge of the internal oblique open. 5. The "fascia jpropria^' is now exposed and must be treated in the same way, but very carefully, as it immediately overlies and envelops the sac, and has almost the same shape as the sac, more especially in femoral hernia. 6. The sac must now be isolated; if small, the entire sac may be freed; but if large, the neck only may be cleared; and, in any case, any extra-peritoneal con- striction should be divided if possible; if not, the sac should be opened and the constriction divided from within. 7. To open the sac, pinch up a part of its wall between the finger and thumb, when it will be possible to rub the opposed surfaces together, or feel if there is anything gliding under the supposed sac; then raise a small point between the finger and thumb or by the dissect- ing forceps, and cut a small part of it horizontally, and then enlarge upwards and downwards on a flat director. When the hernia is small, the sac should be opened at the lower part, as there is usually a small collection of fluid there which protects the gut; in large hernia, open over the neck of the sac. In reducible hernia

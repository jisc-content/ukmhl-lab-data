558 Applied Anatomy: Salivary Fistula. — Deguise's Operation. — A.s already stated (see vol. ii., page 29), in order to cure this condition, we must make it easy for the saliva to go the right way; in other words, to make the oi^eniug into the mouth large and free. A silk thread of some length is taken, and a needle attached to each end. One needle is then passed through the fistula, and directed inwards and backwards through the cheek into the mouth, and the end of the thread brought out; the other needle is next to he passed through the fistula in a similar manner, but must he directed inwards and forwards. In this way a wedge-shaped piece of tissue of the inner surface of the cheek is included in the loop of the thread (Fig. 237). Fig. 237. Operation for Salivary Fistula. The two ends are then to be tied tightly inside the mouth, and the knot is allowed to ulcerate through the included tissue into the cavity of the mouth. In this way a free opening is secured into the mouth. The fistula will then usually close spontaneously, but if not, Dr Duncan's operation for fistula may be performed (see vol. ii., page 53). Head in Congenital 8ypliilis.—Iu addition to the points already cnumer ated (see vol. i., p. 535, and vol. ii., p. 85), the following should be noted:—(1) The high and narrow palate—not always

During the twenty years which have elapsed since the publication of the Appendix to the former Catalogue, more than nine hundred new specimens, forty-four Calculi, over four hundred Drawings, about one hundred Casts and Models, and a collection of nearly two hundred microscopic specimens of Morbid Anatomy, have been added to the Pathological Collection. The Series of Diseases of the Generative Organs and of Deformities of the Pelvis in the Female, have been enriched by the presentation of the collection of Dr. Matthews Duncan in June, 1879. The whole Pathological Collection has been. completely rearranged and renumbered. The anatomical grouping of the Series' of Diseases and Injuries of the various Organs and Structures of the Body has not been materially altered; but in each Series the specimens have been arranged according to a uniform pathological classification. The dry specimens, formerly placed in separate Series, have been interspersed among those preserved in bottles, with the purpose of illustrating more fully the diseases or injuries which they exhibit. Eighty-eight selected specimens from Dr. J. R. Farre's collection have been included in the general Catalogue. All the descriptions have been revised and collated, and some of them amended or extended. The specimens are now numbered consecutively throughout the collection. • L MD^nti°!l0f f6 mici'°ec°Pic chara<^ <*n*V of the specimens of Morbid Growths have been inserted; some of them were examined by myself and others by Mr. Walsham, who presented his microscopic pre- parations to the Museum. Fvi PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE. In order to preserve the historical interest of the collection, the old nomenclature has, in many instances, been retained in the descriptions, the modern synonyms being placed in brackets. To render the Catalogue as useful and complete as possible, cross- references have been given in all cases in which specimens show more than one pathological condition, as well as to the Microscopic Pre- parations, Drawings, and Casts taken from any of the specimens. A Series of General Pathology has been formed; and a Table of References to specimens in other parts of the Museum illustrating General Pathology, has been appended to the Table of Contents of the Series of General Pathology at the commencement of the volume. The Series' of Calculi, Microscopic Specimens, Casts, and Drawings have been arranged in accordance with the general plan of the Catalogue. The specimens included in the former Catalogue may be identified by the old numbers, which are placed at the lower right hand corner of the descriptions. This Catalogue has been prepared under the directions of the Museum Committee, to whom the various plans for its formation have been submitted. I have received valuable aid in the revision of many of the Series of Diseases of the Internal Organs, and some special Series of Surgical Pathology, from Members of the Medical and Surgical Staff, especially from Dr. Matthews Duncan and Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh has also rendered able assistance by revising the greater portion of the proof-sheets. January, 1882. FREDERIC S. EVE.PREFACE TO THE fir V / f t , • I V i> CATALOGUE OF 1831. In the following description the Natural and Morbid Preparations are arranged in the order of their situation in the Museum; an arrangement originally adopted by Mr. Abernethy, in conformity with the plan of his Anatomical and Physiological Lectures. The description of each specimen of Morbid Structure will be found to exhibit only the circumstances which are actually visible in it, except in the instances where the description refers to the recent state of the specimen, when its characters of colour and texture were different from those it may now possess. Whenever it could be safely inferred, from the appearances of the diseased parts, that certain processes were taking place in them at the time of death, these processes are stated. With the description of the specimens of injured and diseased bone, for example, there is an explana- tion of the processes by which dead bone is exfoliated, and new bone formed in its place. In the formation of the Museum only those morbid specimens have been preserved which might be expected to retain their original characters in a sufficient degree to render them useful as objects of future reference. Without this explanation the experienced pathologist would expect to find in the collection more numerous specimens of some organs in the human body which are subject to frequent alterations in their structure. It is due to the liberality of Dr. Conquest here to record the gift of Ins private Collection of Preparations, which have so greatly enriched those departments of the Museum to which they belong. EDWARD STANLEY.PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1 8 4 6. Since the former Catalogue was printed, in 1831, 1,035 preparations have been added to the Pathological division of the Museum. In the formation of the present Catalogue all the descriptions, whether printed in the former one or added to it from year to year in manuscript, have been revised and reconsidered; many of them have been extended; some have been corrected. In all the instances in which it was possible brief histories of the cases have been added to the descriptions of the specimens, together with references to more detailed accounts of them recorded in the Case-Books belonging to the Museum. The general rules of description and the arrangement of the speci- mens adopted by Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Stanley have been but Hitle deviated from. The arrangement appears to be the most convenient for a Museum to which every year brings numerous additions, such as it would be difficult to insert in appropriate places, in a more minute classification But the advantages of an arrangement founded on principles of Pathology are sought to be attained by adding tables of reference to the descriptions of each series. By the help of these tables it will be easy both to find any specimen in the Museum, and to study the preparations in each series in the order in which they may best serve for illustrations of the diseases of the part to which that series is devoted. The following general Table of References is inserted in order tint certain specimens dispersed among the numerous divisions of the MuseumX PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1846. may be examined in the same order as if they had been arranged in a separate series as illustrations of General Pathology—an arrangement which could not have been adopted without detracting from the interest which those specimens contribute to the several series of illustrations of Special Pathology, in which they are now placed. JAMES PAGET.PREFACE TO THE APPENDIX OF THE PRECEDING CATALOGUES, PUBLISHED IN 1862. SlNGE the publication of the former Volumes of the Catalogue in 1846 and 1851, more than a thousand Preparations, and numerous Diagrams, Draw- ings, Models, and Microscopic Specimens have been added to the Museum. These are described in the following pages. The present Volume corresponds to the two former ones, and its contents are arranged upon the same plan. The First Part, which is a continuation of the First Volume, contains a description of the Specimens in Pathology. The Second Part, a con- tinuation of the Second Volume, contains a description of the Specimens in Natural History, the Diagrams, Drawings, Models, and Microscopic Preparations. In January, 1856, the late Dr. Farre presented to the Museum his valuable and interesting collection, including the original Preparations of Dr. Jones, from which are taken the Illustrations of his work on Hemorrhage. A description of these Specimens will be found at the end of the First Part of the Volume. The earlier portions of this, the Third Volume of the Catalogue, have been written by Mr. Paget. Many of the Preparations, indeed thexii PREFACE TO APPENDIX OF PRECEDING CATALOGUES, 1862. majority of them, have been described by Mr. Callender, who has, more- over, prepared the Index and otherwise rendered important assistance. But for all errors which may appear I am responsible. Wm. s. savory. August, 1862.ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. Extracts from the Reports of the Proceedings of General Courts and Committees of the Governors of the Hospital, respecting the Catalogues thereof. The earliest record of the existence of a Museum is in 1726, when a room was provided by the Governors as a " Repository for Anatomical or Chirurgical Preparations," which was placed under the charge of John Freke, Junior Assistant Surgeon to the Hospital. It was ordered* " that whatever preparation shall be given to the Repository, shall be num- bered and the name of the person who gave it, and the history be entered in a Book to be kept at the Compting House." This Record Book is not extant. The earliest specimens of which the origin is known, are, a Congenital Hernia, dissected by Percivall Pott, and a Specimen of Angular Curva- ture of the Spine, from " a patient who was under the care of Mr. Pott." The Specimen of Congenital Hernia was probably prepared before 1756, when Pott published his Essay on that affection. But whether these Specimens were preserved in the Museum of the Medical School, or formed part of a Private Collection made by Pott, and presented by him to Abernethy, it is impossible to say. The latter supposition is not improbable, as there are two crania affected with syphilis in the Museum, which were given by Pott to Abernethy. At a House Committee, held on April 18th, 1821, Mr. Abernethy, in a series of representations urging the Governors to rebuild the Anatomical Theatre, offered to make over his valuable Collection of Specimens of -various Diseases and Injuries" to the Hospital, in trust for the use of the Medical School. This collection amounted "in number to several thousands." * Extract from the Mimites of the Governors, June 23rd 1726.xiv SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. At a Sub-Committee held on the 26th of May, 1828 :— * -Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Stanley having made a tender of the Preparations and all the other property in the Museum, to the Hospital, by the following document:— "We, the undersigned, engage to give up the Preparations, and all the^er proper^ m^e I Museum, to the President, Treasurer, and Almoners of ^^^ISfft preseteTe being, for the use of the Medical School, and we also pledge ourselTes carefully to^e^ same8 to keep the Preparations in a state of good preservation to supply ^^T^ZX decav in a manner adequate to the instruction of students m aU the facts of Anatomy usuaUy StodL^s manned, and to put up specimens of ^f^^^tT2 disease and accident which may be met with in the practice of the Hospital, so long as we tinue to teach Anatomy and Physiology in the school of the Hospital. We also engage - to mafce ^^^Tortt ZSSZSZZt Drawings which we may procure to those in the museum, in oruer ample and useful as possible. (1 jqjj^ ABERNETHY. « EDWARD STANLEY. "St. Babtholojiew's Hospital, " May 3, 1828." The Sub-Committee resolved as follows :— "We recommend that the care of the said Museum be confided here- after to the appointed teacher or teachers of Anatomy, who, from time to time shall communicate to the Medical Committee whatever alterations or additions may take place in the Collection; that it be centered as the dutv of such teacher or teachers to keep the Preparations m a good state of preservation, to supply new ones for those that decay and m a manner adequate to the instruction of students in all the facts of Anatomy ; and also to add new specimens of any interesting circumstances relative to diseases or injuries which may occur in the practice of the Hospital. « That the teachers are also to be required not to make any separate collection, but to add all the Preparations and Drawings to the said Museum • that the medical officers of the Hospital be requested carefully to inspect the Museum, and annually report their observations to the Medical Committee, as well as to the House Committee previous to the Midsummer General Court. The proceedings of this Sub-Committee were confirmed at the General Court of Governors, held July 23rd, 1828. .

XV At a General Court held on the 22nd of July, 1829, Mr. Stanley, on behalf of John Abernethy, Esq., and himself, attended and presented to this Court a Catalogue of the Preparations, &c., con- tained in the Museum of this Hospital, when it was resolved, " That five hundred copies of the Catalogue be printed, under the direction of Mr. Stanley." At a General Court held on the 27th of July, 1831, Mr. Stanley attended and presented to this Court a printed Catalogue of the Preparations, &c., contained in the Museum of this Hospital, which was referred to the House Committee. At a House Committee held on the 8th of July, 1845, the following Report was received from the Medical Officers respecting the Anatomical Museum:— " The Medical Officers desire to draw the attention of the Committee to the present state of the Catalogues of the Anatomical Museum," .... " And beg to submit to the Committee the propriety of causing a new Catalogue to be printed, in which the descriptions of all the specimens added to the Museum, since the printing of the Catalogue of 1831, should be included, and such alterations as are necessary in that Catalogue, should be made." Whereupon it was resolved :— " That a new Catologue of the Museum be printed, agreeably to the suggestion of the Medical Officers, under the direction of the Treasurer and Almoners." Which Resolution was confirmed at the next following General Court of Governors. At a Committee of the Treasurer and Almoners held on the 17th of September, 1846, "Mr. Paget presented a copy of the new Catalogue of the Museum, printed under their direction: whereupon it was resolved that the Cata- logue be forthwith published." At a House Committee held on the 8th of July, 1851, a letter was read from Mr. Paget, requesting permission to commence the piinting, and to make arrangements for the publication of the nearly completed Second Volume of the New Edition of the Catalogue of the Anatomical Museumxvi SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. Whereupon it was resolved:— " That the best thanks of this Committee be presented to Mr. Paget for the preparation and efficient arrangement of the New Catalogue of the Museum;" and it was ordered that the Catalogue be printed accordingly. At a House Committee held on the 15th of April, 1862, a letter was submitted from Mr. Savory, asking to be permitted to print in a single' volume the descriptions in manuscript of many specimens (upwards of 1,300), which had been added to the Museum since the publication of the former Catalogues. Resolved:— " That the said manuscript be now printed as a Supplementary Volume." At a Committee of the Treasurer and Almoners held on the 8th of April, 1880, a letter was read from Mr. Willett on behalf of the Medical Officers and Lecturers, asking the Governors to print a New Catalogue of the Hospital Museum, prepared by Mr. Eve, the Curator—a work which had become necessary for the efficient instruction of the students, and on account of the large addition of specimens, and the removal and re- arrangement of the specimens in the new Museum. Resolved:— " That Mr. Willett be requested to furnish a copy of the Catalogue as revised, and that the Clerk do then obtain from Messrs. Harrison and Sons an estimate of the cost of printing it." I At a Committee of the Treasurer and Almoners held on the 29th July, 1880— Resolved:— " That Messrs. Harrison and Sons be instructed to print 250 copies of the New Museum Catalogue in accordance with their estimate."TABLE OF CONTENTS. ——♦— SERIES I.-DISEASES OF BONES.

A Skull-Cap, exhibiting great enlargement of all the bones in adaptation to the increased size of the brain from hydrocephalus. A. 181 The specimen was taken from a hydrocephalic dwarf, aged 28 years, who was idiotic and extremely rickety. He had never walked. (In Case E.) For other Specimens of Hydrocephalic Skull, see Nos. 2519 to 2521, Series XXX, and 3216, Series L. ATROPHY (and Arrest of Development). 2. A Scapula and part of a Humerus. The arm had been amputated long before death ; and through disuse, the bones are atrophied, but the humerus in a much greater degree than the scapula. The shaft of the humerus has less than half its natural diameter and tapers to a slender cone, at the end of which is some rough new bone. The marks of the attachments of muscles on it are nearly obliterated, and its texture is light and dry. The head of the humerus is flattened and almost entirely absorbed, and there is a corresponding diminution and change of form in the glenoid cavity. A. 157 (In CaseE.) 3. Sections of the stump of a Humerus, exhibiting the results of Atrophy from long disuse after amputation. Its sawn end tapers to a small cone; the walls of the shaft are less than a line in thickness, light and dry ; and nearly all the osseous part of its cancellous tissue being removed, the medullary tube'appears, after maceration, like a smooth-walled cavity. L g\ 4. Pelvis and Lower Extremities of a young man. All the bones of the right side are atrophied. The several prominences on the right os innominatnm are less marked, and its iliac fossa is more shallow, than the corresponding parts on the left side. The bones of the right thigh and leg are all shorter, less in circumference, softer, and lighter, than those of the left limb. From the hip- joint to the ankle there is a difference of nearly two inches in the length of the limbs. In compensation for this difference, the left foot is directed almost vertically, so that in the erect position of the body (in imitation of which the bones are arranged) the extremities of the toes of both limbs are at the same level. All the bones of the right foot are slender, small, and soft. The arch of the sole is much increased by the posterior part of the os calcis proiectino- more than usually downwards. The shaft of the left femur is enlarged bv external deposit of new bone. The muscles of the right limb were small and in a state of fatty degeneration. A The right limb had probably been affected with Infantile Paralysis (In Case B.) JDISEASES OF BONES. 2 (In Case E.) 5. An Os Innominatum and part of a Femur. After amputation through the middle of its shaft, the stump of the femur has atrophied as in specimen No. 2, but its head and the acetabulum are unchanged. A- 1^8 (In Case E.) 6. Section of a Femur, the shaft of which was fractured about two inches below the lesser trochanter, after atrophy and softening of its texture. The fractured portions have united firmly and smoothly, but so that they form an acute angle. The posterior surface of the head of the femur is absorbed where, in the altered position of the lower extremity, it rested on the margin of the acetabulum. I. 92 The other half of this hone, and the opposite femur, which was similarly fractured and united, are preserved in Series III, No. 759. The patient, who was about fifty-six years old, had been bedridden for some years before the fractures occurred ; they were both produced while he was being turned in bed. Presented by William James Jones, Esq. 7. Sections of the upper part of a Femur from a very aged woman. Its texture is remarkably soft and light, and contains an abundance of fatty matter which, in maceration, has assumed the appearance of adipocire. The walls of the femur are at the thickest part not more than a line in thickness : the neck is shortened and is rather less oblique than is natural: the head is reduced in size, and irregularly flattened. T- 206 8. The lower extremity of an Atrophied Femur. Its compact walls are ex- tremely thin ; the anterior is bent, the posterior fractured. Some dense fibrous tissue stretches, like the string of a bow, from the extremity of the condyles to the shaft above the point of fracture. *• 303 From a child whose limb was amputated on account of long-standing disease of the knee- joint. A drawing of these parts will be found—No. 1. 9. Part of a Femur from an aged person. Its walls are thin and atrophied, from disuse of the limb after fracture through the neck of the femur. C. 125 (In Case E.) 10. Sections of a Femur in which there is an enlargement of the medullary cavity with thinning of the walls, and general lightness and dryness of texture. A. 92 (In Case E.) 11. Sections of the upper part of a Tibia, exhibiting the effects of extreme atrophy. The walls are so thin that they are in nearly every part transparent. The in- terior of the bone is filled with soft fat, intersected by few and very slender cancelli. The articular surface is ulcerated and partly covered with the fibrous tissue of adhesions. L 263 12. A Section of the shaft and lower end of the same Tibia, partially macerated. It presents the same character of atrophy as the preceding specimen, and shows in a more marked manner the diminution of size which is associated with the thinning of the walls and the proportionate increase of fat. i. 264 The patient was a lad 15 years old, who had suffered for more than a year with disease of the knee-joint. The limb had been kept constantly at rest; but there was nothing in the history of the case to explain the remarkable atrophy not only of the tibia, but of the femur, fibula, and all the bones of the foot. The patient recovered after amputation of the limb. 13. The Bones of the left Leg and Foot of a young woman, aged 23, who had Infantile Paralysis of the left lower extremity when she was eighteen months old. She regained only very imperfect use of the limb. The tendo Achillis was divided three years before the leg was removed, but only slight improve- ment followed this and other treatment.DISEASES OF BONES. 3 Complete fatty degeneration of all the muscles had taken place. See Medical Times and Gazette, April 4th, 1863. For other Specimens of Atrophy, see Series IT, No. 638, and Series III, Nos. 759 and 760, Series V, Nos. 1116, 1125, and Series L, No. 3217. ABSORPTION FROM PRESSURE. 14. The Base of a Skull from an elderly woman who appeared to have been long in the habit of wearing a plug to close an opening in the palate. The opening, gradually enlarging, attained such a size that nothing remains of the palatine portions of the superior maxillary and palate bones; and the alveolar border of the jaw is reduced to a very thin plate, without any trace of the sockets of the teeth. The antrum is on both sides obliterated by the apposition of its walls, its inner wall having probably been pushed outwards as the plug was enlarged to fit the enlarging aperture in the palate. Nearly the whole of the vomer also has been absorbed, and the superior ethmoidal cells are laid open. The plug is preserved : it is composed of a large circular cork, with tape wound round it, and measures an inch and three-quarters in diameter and am inch in depth. I. 232 The history of the patient is unknown. She was brought from a workhouse to the dissect- ing rooms, with the plug tightly and smoothly fitted in the roof of the mouth. (In Case E.) 15. A Section of four Dorsal and Lumbar Vertebrae, the bodies of which have been deeply hollowed out by absorption consequent on the pressure of an aneurism of the aorta. The surface of bone formed part of the aneurismal sac, and layers of fibrin still adhere to it. It will be observed, that the inter- vertebral fibro-cartilages and contiguous edges of the bones are entire. i. 55 16. Portion of a Spine in which there are several excavations upon the front and sides of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal, and first lumbar vertebrae. These excavated surfaces formed part of the boundaries of an aneurism of the aorta. Around the excavations there are some deposits of new bone. i. 156 17. Lower Dorsal and upper Lumbar Vertebrae, showing the eroding effects produced by the pressure of an aortic aneurism. (In Case E.) Presented by Oke Clarke, Esq. INFLAMMATION OF BONE AND PERIOSTEUM AND ITS RESULTS* 'Hie following twelve preparations were obtained by a series of experiments per- formed by Mr. Stanley: see his work on Diseases of the Bones, Plates VIII and IX. NECROSIS OF THE SUPERFICIAL LAYER. 18. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which necrosis has been produced in the outer layers of a small portion of its wall. The dead bone is distinguishable by its yellow colour. The living bone around it is increased in vascularity, and * Syphilitic diseases of bone will be found in a separate section, p. 40. B24 DISEASES OF BONES. in one situation the separation of the dead bone has been commenced by the formation of a groove between it and the living bone. l- *-o The death of the hone was produced by the perforation of its walls. 19. Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting a portion of its wall dead and in process of exfoliation. The dead bone is distinguishable from the living by its whiter colour; its separation is almost complete. Between the dead and the living bone a space intervenes, which is filled by soft and vascular substance. New bony matter is heaped upon the living bone around the dead bone, as well as in a thick layer on that side of the shaft which is opposite the seat of the necrosis. The periosteum has been in part detached from the tibia, to show that the new bone is entirely beneath this membrane, having been formed between it and the surface of the original wall of the bone, with which, how- ever, it has completely coalesced. *• The changes just described succeeded the cauterization of the external surface of the bone. 20. Tibia of a Dog, from which a portion of the wall, nearly similar to that which is shown in process of separation in the preceding specimen, has entirely exfoliated. The surface from which the dead bone has been separated is very vascular ; and new bone is deposited in considerable quantity on the surface of the shaft around and opposite to it. L y This preparation was made in the same manner as the preceding. TOTAL NECROSIS. 21. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which the shaft of the bone, in its whole length and in nearly its whole thickness, died. The periosteum, which is thickened, separated from it. Upon the internal surface of the separated periosteum, the formation of new bone has taken place m small irregular deposits. The old bone, at its extremities, still retains connexion with the periosteum; hence it has received some of the fluid injected into the blood vessels. The death of the bone was produced by the destruction of the medulla, as in No. 24. 22 Sections of the Tibia of a Dog, in which, as in the preceding nearly the whole shaft of the bone has died. The dead bone is in process of separation, and new bone is formed around it in much larger quantity than m the preceding specimen. The periosteum which belonged to the old bone covers the^new bone. The death of the bone was produced by the destruction of the medulla, as in No. 24. PARTIAL. NECROSIS. 23 Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which Necrosis was produced in a portion of the middle of its shaft. The dead bone, not yet separated from the living is in part enclosed by new bone which has been formed around it. I. 14 The necrosis was produced by the destruction of the medulla. 24 Section of the Tibia of a Dog, in which a large portion of the cancellous tissue and of the wall of the shaft perished. The dead bone lay m a cavity with very vascular walls, and new bone was m process of formation around it The periosteum which belonged to the old bone covers the new bone; but many fistulous holes extend through it into the cavity which contained the old b°The walls of the bone were perforated, and the medulla destroyed. The bone was laid bare for that purpose at the part where now the largest aperture into the cavity exists.5 DISEASES OF BONES. REPAIR AFTER NECROSIS. 25. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of reparation after a small portion of its anterior wall had been removed. The space left by the lost bone is partially filled by new matter, like granulations growing from the medulla, and new bone is formed on the surface of the shaft around it. I. 12 26. Fore Leg of a Dog, in which Necrosis of nearly the whole shaft of the Radius has been produced by destruction of the medulla. The dead shaft has been separated from the articular ends, and new bone is in progress of forma- tion around its extremities. i. 17 27. Section of the Radius and Ulna of a Dog exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of fche shaft of the former. The dead bone is completely separated, and new bono is abundantly formed around it. The cavity in which the dead bone is contained, is lined by a very thick and vascular membrane. I. 15 The necrosis was produced by the destruction of the medulla. 28. Sections of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting Necrosis of a small portion of the posterior wall, and deposit of new bone around the exfoliating portion. I. 16 29. The Tibia of a Dog, in which Necrosis of part of the shaft was produced by destruction of the medulla. The dead bone was separated by natural processes, and has been removed, with the exception of a small portion which is dis- tinguishable in the centre of the new osseous cylinder. The new bone presents a very irregular external surface, and is firmly united to the articular ends of the old bone. x ^43 DIFFUSE (ACUTE) PERIOSTITIS (Acute Necrosis). 30. A Clavicle, with some of the adjacent tissues. The whole length of the clavicle, with the exception of its acromial end, and its sternal epiphysis has undergone necrosis. It lies in a cavity which is lined by the separated periosteum and which was filled with bloody pus. The tissues around this cavitv are consolidated. £ 25g The patient, a delicate boy, 5 years old, fell on his shoulder. Several days afterwards he complained ot severe pap m and about the clavicle. The parts were swollen and so painful that a complete examination of them could not be made. The case was treated as one of tractured clavicle ; but in a few clays, severe inflammation of the pericardium, heart, and pleura, supervened, and the child died eleven days after receiving the injury. p^uias Presented by Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson. 31. A Femur, showing the results of Diffuse Periostitis. The periosteum was completely separated from the shaft by a largo collection of pus. i. 366 The specimen was taken from a child aged 2* years, who was admitted to the liospital with swelling of the thigh, supposed to be due to a fracture occasioned by rough usaee while nt play Ihe case was treated accordingly. The child died suddenly, immediately after bein' raised in bed, on the tenth day after admission to the hospital. g The autopsy revealed the condition of the femur described general nviwrnin «n'rt> : vi The heart is preserved in Series VII, No. 1234.

Sections of a Tibia, from a boy 18 years of age, exhibiting the effects of acute inflammation in its medullary tissue and periosteum. Lymph aud pus are abundantly deposited in the cancellous tissue throughout its whole extent. Irregular ulcerations extend through the cancellous structure of the bone at each of its extremities, and have passed through the articular cartilages into the knee and ankle-joints; suppuration has also taken place between the epiphyses and the shaft. The periosteum, separated from the shaft of the bone in nearly its whole length, is very vascular, thick, pulpy, and velvet-like onrts inner surface. Other bones from the knee and ankle-joint of the same patient are in the next Series, No. 573. 34. Part of a Lower Extremity, showing Diffuse Periostitis of the Tibia and acute inflammation of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. The thickened periosteum is detached from the anterior surface of the upper two-thirds ot the shaft of the tibia, and the bone is white and dead ; elsewhere the periosteum appears normal. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint is intensely m- iected, but the cartilages are not altered. In front a glass rod is passed through a communication, which existed between the under surface of the detached periosteum and the joint. The cavity of the synovial membrane was failed with pus, and the membrane had given way at its upper and outer part, allowing its contents to track along the surface of the femur. From a boy, aged 15, who fell and struck his knee : eight days after lie was admitted into the hospital witfiVcoUection of pus beneath the periosteiun of the tibia which w^mcjjed. Pyemia developed itself, and he died with pericarditis, embolic abscesses m the lung, and thiom bosis of a primary branch of the pulmonary artery .-See Kenton Ward Boole, vol. vi, p. 14b. 35. Section of the Tibia of a boy, in which there is Necrosis of the middle half of the shaft, with detachment of the soft parts from the whole circumference ot the dead portion. The separation of the dead bone from the Irving has com- menced, and is marked on the cut surface and exterior of the bone by »lc^ated grooves. It is probable from the history of the case that the necrosis commenced in inflammation of the periosteum, followed by extensive suppuration around the bone. 36. The other half of the Tibia last described. l- 200 37 The Tibia of the child from whom specimen (Series XI, No. 1712) was taken The periosteum is separated from the whole surface of the shaft, which had probably perished. INFLAMMATION OF THE PERIOSTEUM WITH FORMATION OF NEW BONE (Osteo-Plastic Periostitis). 38. Section of a Femur, on the surface of which numerous irregular plates of new bone are deposited. (In Cane E.) 39. A Femur enlarged by the deposit of new bone on its lower part immediately above the condyles. (In Case E.) 40 A Tibia and Fibula with part of the Tarsus. The tibia and fibula are enlarged, and there are sharp-edged plates and processes of new bone upon their surfaces The lower part of the interosseous ligament is ossified, and the os calcis, astragalus, and cuboides are all united by bone. These changes appear to have resulted from the irritation set up by caries of the tarsus. a. Zo (In Case E.) 41. Section of a Tibia exhibiting great increase of thickness in its walls, withDISEASES OF BONES. 7 (In Case E.) narrowing of the medullary tube, and consolidation of the medullary texture by thickening of the cancelli. The periosteum is detached, showing its thickened state upon the diseased part of the bone. L 0ii 42. The other Section of the same Tibia. The enlargement is caused by the formation of a thick layer of new bone, like a node with a coarsely-nodulated surface, round the middle of the shaft. In the corresponding part of the medullary tissue, the osseous filaments and lamellae are thickened and indurated, and have encroached on the medullary spaces till they are nearly obliterated. A. 19 (In Case E.) 43. Portion of a Fibula partially enlarged. A- 21 (In Case E.) FORMATION OF NEW BONE RESULTING FROM THE IRRITATION OF ULCERS OF THE INTEGUMENTS, &c. 44. Lower two-thirds of a Tibia and Fibula from a man, who had long suffered from a chronic ulcer of the leg, on account of which the limb was amputated. 45. Lower halves of a Tibia and Fibula firmly united for two inches above the ankle-joint, by the growth of a large irregular mass of bone from their posterior and outer surfaces. There is a deep groove for the passage of the tendons of the peronsei muscles behind this growth. A. 47 A large ulcer had for many years existed on the outer and back part of the leg immediately above the ankle-joint. (In Case E.) 46. A Tibia exhibiting an irregular thickening of its walls in the middle and anterior part of its shaft. An ulcer in the soft parts covei'ing the thickened bone had existed many years, and on this account the limb was amputated. Two distinct changes may be here recognized ; namely, thickening by separation of the layers of the wall, and deposit of new bone on its exterior. A. 40 (In Case E.) 47. Sections of a Tibia, exhibiting a circumscribed thickening and induration of its anterior wall; probably the effect of an ulcer of the investing soft parts. a. 23 (In Case E.) 47a. Section of a Tibia similarly diseased. A. 24 (In Case E.) 48. Lower half of a Tibia, of which the walls are thickened and increased in density. The chief increase is on the anterior aspect of the shaft, where, also, the surface of the new bone is peculiarly rough, coral-like, and spongy ; characters indicative of new bone formed in circumstances of constant irritation. a. 48 The irritation arose in this case from an ulcer of the integuments, which had existed for a long time pi'evious to the amputation of the limb. (In Case E.) 49. Portion of a Tibia partially enlarged. On its front surface there is a circum- scribed oval elevation of new bone with an abrupt margin, over which it is probable there was an ulcer of the soft parts. A- 22DISEASES OF BONES. 8 50.

Portions of a Tibia and Fibula thickened in their walls, and with plates of new bone upon their external surfaces. a. 28 (In Case E.) 52. A Tibia and Fibula generally enlarged, with ossification of the interosseous membrane. There is a circumscribed oval elevation of new bone on the front and lower part of the tibia, over which it is probable there was an old ulcer of the soft parts of syphilitic origin. a. 15 (In Case E.) 53. Portion of a Tibia, on the external surface of which, above the malleolus, new bone has been formed on a circumscribed oval space. A part of the new bone has been destroyed by ulceration, which probably extended into it from an ulcer of the integuments. a. 50 (In Case E.) 54. Portion of a Tibia, exhibiting superficial ulceration, with a porous appearance of the surrounding bone : the result of disease like that shown in the prece- ding specimen. a. 76 (In Case E.) OSTEO-MYELITIS AND ACUTE OSTITIS. 55. The greater portion of the Cannon Bone of a young Ass. Eighteen days before death a peg of bone was driven deeply into a hole bored into it. When removed and divided longitudinally the bone presented the signs of acute inflammation. The medullary membrane and the cancellous tissue were of a bright red colour ; even the compact wall of the shaft appeared of a pale pinkish hue. The colours rapidly disappeared after immei'sion in strong spirit. 56.

Upon section it presented similar signs of acute inflammation, though in a less degree. The medullary membrane and cancellous tissue were not so intensely red. 57. The Tibia of the same animal, into which, eighteen days before death, two pegs had been inserted. Upon section it presented the signs of inflammation in a degree about equal to that of the previous specimen. 58.

The sections of the humerus exhibit thickening of the medullary membrane, which is, in some parts, upwards of a line in thickness, and presents an uneven velvet-like surface. A portion of cancellous tissue has separated after necrosis and lies loose in the medullary cavity. A piece of glass is passed through a long fistulous passage leading from the medullary cavity through the lower end of the humerus into the el bow-joint.

Portions of the Lower End of the Right Femur removed by amputation from a man, aged 27 years, who had suffered from obscure disease of the knee for four years. The knee was much enlarged, and there was extreme unnatural lateral motion with a grating sensation, supposed to be in the joint itself. After removal, the synovial membrane was found to be thickened and dilated, but the joint was otherwise sound and admitted of no undue motion. The grating and mobility were due to a separation of the condyles from the shaft of t lie femur and a hollowing out of the posterior surface of the bone. The distortion was due to the leg and condyles of the femur having been drawn upwards and backwards. The excavated surfaces of the bone were covered with a smooth hard layer of bone, except in places where crops of granulations had sprung up. In the soft parts around were traces of old purulent collections. The shaft of the femur has been divided vertically ; it is very dense, and covered with a thick layer of new bone. (In Case E.) 71.

Fragments of the upper part of a Skull increased to from half an inch to three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and consisting throughout of a very fine spongy or porous substance, which is dry, hard, and heavy, but friable and crumbling under the fingers, like hardened mortar. Into this substance both all the diploe and the tables of the skull are changed: in the inner table scarcely any trace, in the outer no trace, of compact substance remains. The grooves and apertures for blood-vessels in the inner table are very strongly marked. i. 36 73. Part of the vertex of a Skull, a Patella and Tibia affected with Ostitis Deformans (Paget). All the sutures of the skull are obliterated ; the thickness is in every part greatly increased. The temporal ridge is very prominent. In the median vertical section the frontal bone measures 11 to 13 lines the parietal 14 to 16, and the occipital 8 to 12, which is about four times the usual thickness of the normal bones. The outer surface of the skull is finely porous and perforated by innumerable apertures for blood-vessels. The inner surface is little changed except by the enlargement of all channels and apertures for blood-vessels. The cut surface is for the most part dense and compact, but in some parts porous, cancellous' or eavernous ; the spaces were filled with soft reddish substance like medulla There are also larger cavities in which soft cancerous growths were Jodo-ed' The outer surface of the tibia is irregular, finely nodular, and perforated bv numerous apertures for the transmission of blood-vessels.

The Haversian canals were much dilated, many of them con fluent, but the vessels were usually small compared to the size of the canals. These bones with the femur (No. 74) were taken from a gentleman aged 68 years When 46 years old he began to be subject to aching pains in the legs and thighs, and alter about a year noticed that the left shin was mis-shapen. Thirteen years later the left femur and tibia had a well-marked anterior curve, and the surface of the latter was nodular and uneven. Jiis hats becoming too tight, he had to take successively larger sizes. The Left lemur and tibia became larger, heavier, and more curved. Very slowly those of the right limb were similaily affected. His skull continued gradually to enlarge. The spine became very slowly curved, and almost rigid. In height he sank about four inches. Shortly before his death, wnicli took place from pleurisy, a malignant tumour appeared in the upper third of the Left radius On post mortem examination, a spindle-cell sarcoma was found to involve the left radius, and there were malignant deposits in the skull, pleura and anterior mediastinum.-See an account of the case by fcir J.

From a girl aged 18, whose leg was removed by amputation. Twelve years previously the leg was squeezed in a crowd. Three years later abscesses formed about the limb, from which pieces of bone were discharged at different periods. The leg grew larger, and two large ulcers formed on its anterior surface, which penetrated the bone.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 319. 102. Sections of the Tibia of a lad about 18 years of age. The left tibia is nearly an inch longer than the right; in its increase of length it has become curved, its ends, confined by their attachments to the fibula, having been hindered from separating more widely. The left tibia is increased in thickness as well as in length, chiefly by the expansion of its walls. The front wall is, in parts, an inch thick and composed of nearly uniform cancellous tissue : it is also more lengthened than the other walls. a. 46 (In Case E.) 103.

On its anterior surface there are circumscribed deposits of new bone, such as are found under ulcers of the integuments. The curvature of the tibia is not like that which takes place in rickets, but like that in the two preceding specimens, which is due to the tibia becoming elongated at the same time that it enlarges, and to the separation of its ends from each other as it elongates, being prevented by its connexion with the fibula.

The head of the fibula is united by bone to that of the tibia. (In Case P.) 109. Sections of a Tibia and a Fibula. The shaft of the tibia is generally en- larged and hardened. Upon its external surface there are irregular deposits of bone, sharp-edged and overhanging. Internally it presents a nearly uniform, closely cancellated texture, in which there is hardly a distinction between the walls and the medullary cavity. Just above the ankle-joint, in the situation ot the medullary canal, there is an irregular elongated cavity communicating ex- ternally by a small round aperture, or cloaca, through the walls. It is probable therefore that there was necrosis of a portion of cancellous tissue at this part. The fibula is thinly covered by new bone. A- 6 5 (In Case F.) 110. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula.

Small portions only of the external lamella) remain, and these are in many parts covered by a thin layer of new bone. The epiphyses of the great trochanter and of the head of the bone have separated. i. 221 These changes were consequent on sloughing over the great trochanter, which ensued in a prolonged case of psoas abscess in a young subject. 138. Sections of the Femur of a young subject, in which there is a Carious Cavity in the cancellous texture just above the condyles. There are irregular ulcerated apertures in the walls of the bone through which the matter passed from the cancellous texture into the surrounding soft parts. For some distance beyond the seat of the disease, deposits of new bone have taken place upon the outer surface of the femur, and the layers of the wall are separated. The whole of the bone is light, dry, fragile, and white. I. 94 139.

He died of pyaemia. The disease appears to have originated in inflammation about the fang of a tooth.—See Kenlon Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 21. 152. A Lower Jaw, which, with the exception of the ascending rami, has undergone Necrosis. Considerable portions of the alveolar process have been destroyed by caries and necrosis. From a boy, aged 3 years. A fortnight before his admission to the hospital, a swelling of the left side of the face was observed, which gradually iucreased. The mother stated that he had been playing with a cat, which had to be killed on account of a foetid discharge from its nose. On admission there was a more or less circumscribed swelling of the alveolar process of the left side of his lower jaw, with some ulceration of its surface, having a phagedsenic appearance, and foetid discharge. The swelling gradually extended until the whole of the lower jaw was affected, and there was inuch brawny swelling of the face. Finally a slough appeared on the left cheek, which penetrated into the mouth. The child died exhausted seven weeks after the first appearance of the disease, believed to be Cancrum Oris.—See Lucas Word Book, vol. vi, p. 396, and Bath. Soc. Trans., 1881. 153.

A Lower Jaw, nearly the whole body of which suffered Necrosis after the ;u I ministration of a few grains of calomel in a case of fever. The dead bone is in part separated, and a small quantity of new bone is deposited around it. i. 102 155. A Lower Jaw which was separated after Necrosis ; from a female 20 years old. Previous to the necrosis the whole of the jaw had been covered by a formation of porous, hard, greyish, new bone; and this, which extends even over the condyles and coronoid processes, perished with the original substance of the jaw, and was exfoliated with it. i. 168 The disease commenced six years before the removal of the jaw. In the operation for removal the middle of the jaw was cut from the rest and extracted first: one lateral half was removed the next day; and the other, three weeks afterwards. The wound made in the operation, and the sinuses which had led to the diseased bone, healed quickly, and the patient recovered completely ; regaining the power of mastication with those of the lower teeth which remained imbedded in the gum after the removal of the jaw.

L 321 The two portions which are fastened together were separately removed, at an interval of a few months, from a boy aged 12. The death of the bone followed an attack of glanders contracted from a diseased horse. Subsequently an entire new bone was gradually formed. ' Presented by Mr. Barrow. 157. The lower half of a Humerus, which was amputated for Acute Necrosis. The outer surface of the bone is rough and "worm-eaten," especially in the proximity of a fracture, which passes obliquely through the middle of the specimen. The medullary canal contained pus. 1 Er01? ffm,an' aged 45 years' who was admired to the hospital with a swelling around the lower half of the humerus, which had commenced five weeks previously. Spontaneous frac- ture ot the bone occurred after his admission. The nature of the swelling and history of the case gave rise to the opinion that the humerus was the seat of a malignant tumour The necrosis appeared to have been due to diffuse periostitis and osteo-myelitis. The end of the humerus necrosed after amputation, necessitating re-amputation.-See Darker Ward Book, vol. v, p. 271. 158. Necrosis of the shaft of an Ulna, which was removed by operation after its separation from the epiphyses. ' yDISEASES OF BONES. 22 From a child 46 weeks of age. At the eleventh week she had been vaccinated, and pro- gressed without any untoward symptoms until the sixteenth, when she suffered from chicken pox, and subsequently from acute necrosis of the left fore-arm. After being under treatment for nineteen weeks the bone was removed, and the arm began to regain its natural appearance. 159. Part of the shaft of the Ulna of a child 4 years of age, which separated after necrosis. *• 1^0 The cause was unknown. 160.

The dead bone was removed after death. Presented by Carston Holthouse, Esq. 165. Acute Necrosis of a large portion of the shaft of a Femur, removed by amputation from an infant 15 months old: spontaneous fracture had occurred a few days before. The shaft is separated from the lower epiphysis, but the knee-joint is not affected. The disease, which commenced spontaneously, had existed a few weeks. The case terminated fatally. See Lucas Ward Boole, vol. iii, p. 283. 166. Portion of the Femur of a child which separated in consequence of Ne- crosis. The separated portion includes the whole shaft and neck of the bone, with the exception of some small pieces of the outer layers of the shaft. I. 204 The recovery of the child, after the separation, was complete ; the thigh was firm and not much shortened. 167. Necrosis of nearly the whole shaft of the Femur. The chief interest of this case lay in the fact that the necrosis was unaccompanied by suppuration, i. 378 The patient from whom the specimen was removed (by amputation at the hip-joint) was a man a<red 20, who was quite well until about ten weeks before his admission into the hospital, when he began to suffer from deep-seated pain, soon followed by swelling of the left thigh. About six weeks after the beginning of his illness, the limb suddenly gave way as he was walk- in a across a room, and he fell. On subsequent examination it was found that the extremity was much shortened, evidently in consequence of a fracture of the femur in its middle third. On making a section of the limb after amputation no inflammation of the integuments or muscles, no abscess or sinus were found, and not a drop of pus was visible. The fracture, which was five'or six weeks old at the time of the operation, is surrounded by fibrous tissue, in which new bone has been deposited, so as to form a somewhat bulky callus. This band of connection is however, but feeble. The upper half of the femur at its posterior aspect has not perished, but is considerably thickened by the formation of new bone. The dead bone is not at all points loosened from its connections, but is still continuous with the cancellous tissue of the interior at the upper and lower extremities of the shaft: it is surrounded by a moderately thick sheath of hard new bone, which is continuous with the portion of the wall of the shaft that is not necrosed. There are one or two small openings in the sheath of new bone, which seemed, in the recent state, rather as if made accidentally after removal of the hmb, than like cloaca. t A Drawing of the specimen is preserved, JNo, be.DISEASES OF BONES. 23 The other half of the specimen is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons The case is described by Mr. W. Morrant Baker in the Med. Chir. Trans., vol. lx, 1877. 168. Part of the Femur of a boy 13 years old. Almost all the lower half of the siiaft has perished in its whole thickness, and was in process of separation Deep grooves have been formed between it and the adjacent living bone, on all parts of which new bone has been deposited. A- 121 The disease commenced after a blow on the knee, five weeks before the amputation of the limb. (In Case F.) 169. The left Tibia of a boy aged 8. Some weeks before death he received an injury to the limb, which was followed by acute necrosis of the shaft of the tibia. A layer of new bone extends from the lower epiphysis for some distance around the dead shaft of the bone. Acute pericarditis, probably the result of pyremia, terminated his life. 170. The shaft of a Tibia in a state of necrosis. r. 320 It was removed from a girl aged 14. She recovered from the operation. Nothing could be learned respecting her subsequent history. Presented by J. Hales, Esq. 171. A Sequestrum, consisting of the whole shaft of the right Fibula, removed from a boy aged 7, the subject of infantile paralysis of both lower extremities. The inflammation causing the necrosis followed the friction of instruments, which had been used six months before his admission to the Hospital, with the object of supporting the paralysed limbs. 172. The greater part of the shaft of a young person's Fibula, which was attacked by Necrosis, without obvious cause. Complete repair took place. L 158 173. An Os Calcis which, has undergone necrosis. 174. Sections of a Cuneiform Bone necrosed and separated; the cancellous tissue is infiltrated with pus, and the articular surfaces are superficially ulcerated. i. 246 The disease was of long standing, and the soft parts about the tarsus were the seat of numerous abscesses and fistulous passages ; but this bone alone was materially diseased. The patient, a young man, recovered after the amputation of the foot. For other Specimens of Necrosis of the Entire Shaft of a Bone, see Nos. 30 to 37, 21, 22, 26, 244, 253, 255, 256. OTHER SPECIMENS OF NECROSIS. 175. Portion of the left half of the Vei'tex of a Skull. A trephine opening into which the button has been inserted is seen anterior to the parietal eminence. A considerable portion of the parietal, with part of the squamous bone is necrosed. A distinct groove delineates the necrosed bone, both the inner and outer surfaces of which are rough and " worm-eaten." From a girl aged 17, who fell out of a second floor window, and sustained, in addition to other injuries, a deep scalp wound which laid bare the left parietal bone. A " puffy" swelling appeared about the scalp wound with symptoms of meningitis, followed by those of compression. Tre- phining was performed about three weeks after lier admission, and a small quant ily of pus was let out from beneath the dura mater. Some improvement followed the operation, but she died comatose twenty-four days afterwards. A large abscess was found occupying the left hemisphere of the brain, and communicating with the lateral ventricle.—See Stanley Ward Book, vol. v, p. 402. 176. A large portion of a Skull which exfoliated after trephining. I. 79 177. A Skull from a Lunatic.

TheDISEASES OF BONES. 24 size of the aperture left in the upper and back part of the skull was, during the twelve years in which the man survived the injury, in a very slight degree diminished by the growth of bone from its margins. The exposed part of the dura mater was covered by a dense tissue like that of an ordinary cicatrix. i. 100 The patient was 23 years old when, after many attempts to commit suicide, he laid bis head on a fire and remained till the whole of the scalp was completely charred and a portion of the bone was calcined. The process of exfoliation of the bone occupied eighteen months; but a complete cicatrix formed. When he recovered, the patient, though still insane, did not again attempt to destroy himself. (In Case E.) 178. A Skull-Cap, in which there has been Necrosis of a large portion of both tables of the frontal and right parietal bones. A groove, beginning in the outer table and gradually deepening, has been formed around the dead bone.

A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive Necrosis and Ulceration of the whole thickness of the parietal bones. A groove has been formed around the dead bone; the increased vascularity of the adjoining margin of the living bone is shown by the numerous minute apertures in it. As is usual, no new bone is formed on the outer table around the sequestrum ; but a thin layer of new bone is formed on that portion of the inner table to the margin of which the groove of separation, commencing in the outer table and gradually deepening, has penetrated. a. 10G (In Case F.) 180.

Portions of necrosed Bone removed from the margin of the foramen magnum; one portion included the posterior third of the foramen, the other contains the right posterior condyloid foramen. Taken from a man, aged 27, who fell heavily on the back of his head six years before his admission to the hospital. The injury was followed by constant pain and stiffness about the back of the head and neck. Ten months later abscesses formed and discharged in the same region. When admitted to the hospital the right side of the tongue was exceedingly wasted and shrunken, and when protruded, the organ was directed towards the right side. Its sensa- tion was unimpaired ; the speech was thick. The pieces of necrosed bone preserved were removed by operation, and the patient recovered. In six months the right side of the tongue had nearly regained its normal size and power.—See Clinical Society's Transactions, vol. iii, p. 238. 204. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been Necrosis of the posterior wall of the lower part of the shaft. The dead bone was separated, but was held by a bridge of new bone formed across it.

The entire inner condyle, and the shaft in the vicinity of the cavity, are considerably enlarged, but no new bone is deposited around the necrosed portion, nor is the periosteum materially thickened. l 3^2 From a young man whose limb was amputated on account of the disease. 213.

A Femur, in which it is probable that there has been Necrosis of a portion of the inner wall and cancellous tissue of the lower part of the shaft. There is a large cavity in this part, and by its side many smaller ones, around which the wall of the bone is thickened, porous, covered by new bone, and penetrated by an oval aperture. A- (In Case F.) 215. The corresponding ends of a Femur and Tibia. In a heavy fall, the femur was fractured about three inches above the condyles. The fragments are firmly united ; but the upper one lies in front of the lower, overlapping it. In con- sequence of the same injury, necrosis ensued in a small portion of the tibia, including part of its articular surface. The sequestrum, when the limb was amputated many years after the injury, was found loose within a large cavity m the head of the tibia; this cavity opens through the anterior wall by the side of the tubercle of the tibia, and more widely into the knee-joint. The articular surfaces of both femur and tibia are ulcerated; and in the inner condyle of the femur, there is a deep cavity like that of an abscess, corresponding with the cavity in which the sequestrum lies in the head of the tibia. A. 114 (In Case F.) Presented by Thomas Sympson, Esq. 216. Sections of the upper part of a Tibia, in which portions of the cancellous tissue have suffered necrosis and are partially separated. Lymph and pus are diffused upon and within the dead portions of bone ; the medullary canal contains them alone, the rest of its osseous and fatty tissue being removed. The walls of the tibia are thickened and penetrated by several apertures into the medullary tube. The disease is limited to the shaft of the tibia. I. 268 From an old man in whom the disease had existed more tban twenty years. 217. The head of a Tibia divided vertically. Nearly in its centre, as seen in the upper and lower sections, is an irregular cavity lined by a soft, pulpy membrane. In the upper half of the cavity there is a portion of necrosed bone, which, during life, was loose and surrounded by discoloured and foetid pus. A tortuous sinus communicates with the surface of the limb. The head of the tibia is enlarged in every direction, and its cancellous tissue is dense and indurated. L ^05 This preparation was obtained after amputation through the thigh. The operation had become necessary in consequence of the rapid failing of the health of the patient under the long- continued irritation resulting from the disease. 218. Sections of a Tibia, in which a portion of the cancellous tissue of the head died and was separated: it lay loose within a large cavity in the head of the bone, which is lined by soft vascular tissue, and the opposite walls of which are shown in the two sections. The periosteum, thickened and vascular, has been partially reflected, to show the rough external surface formed by the accumulation of new bone on the outer surface of the head of the tibia. i. 4 219. Sections of a Tibia in which there has been Necrosis of a portion of the cancellous texture near its head. A portion of the dead bone was probably removed through the smooth oval aperture in the adjacent thickened wall; the rest of it is not completely separated, but a deep groove bounds it. k. 102 (In Case F.) 220. A Foot which was removed by Symes' amputation. Suspended is the upper part of the astragalus, which had necrosed and separated from its connections : its head is still covered by cartilage.DISEASES OF BONES. 29 From a boy aged 6, who had suffered from disease of the ankle-joint for ten months. Numerous discharging sinuses communicated with the joint. The disease, which probably commenced in the astragalus, was of idiopathic origin.—Soo Harley Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 185. 221. Sections of a Tibia, of which a portion of the cancellous tissue near its lower end has suffered Necrosis and been separated. The sequestrum lay loose in a cavity lined by thin organized membrane. In one of the sections the half of the sequestrum is retained in its place; in the other, it has been removed to expose the interior of the cavity. The walls of the bone around the cavity are slightly thickened, and there are two ulcerated apertures extending through them: but their texture, as well as that of the periosteum, is nearly healthy. There is also a wide ulcerated aperture through the articular surface of the bone, and nearly the whole of its cartilage is removed. i. 242 From a boy 7 years old, in whom the disease, arising from no evident cause, had existed for some years. Numerous abscesses about the ankle rendered amputation necessary. Presented by Joseph Hodgson, Esq. 222. An Os Calcis. In its posterior third is a considerable cavity lined by a soft, and, when recent, extremely vascular membrane. This cavity communicated by means of a sinus with the sole, and with the inner side of the foot. It contained foetid pus, and the mass of dead bone seen in one-half of the preparation. The bone thus situated was necrosed and separated, but, being impacted at the point where the sinus communicated with the cavity, there w as no evidence, during life, of the completion of its isolation. The membranous lining is perforated at various points by spicuhe of bone, apparently growing from the adjacent osseous tissue, which is dense and indurated. I. 307 The man, aged 22 years, from whom this os calcis was obtained, had suffered for more than four years from symptoms indicative of necrosis of part of this bone. He also had a tubercular affection of the lungs, a combination of circumstances rendering it desirable to amputate the foot. The operation was attended with temporary benefit. Death was occa- sioned by the disease of the lungs nine months afterwards. The case is recorded in the Hospital Reports, yol. xvi, p. 317. 223. Portion of a Tarsus, exhibiting Necrosis of the Os Calcis. The whole of the internal cancellous texture of the bone has perished, and was in process of separation from the thin osseous layer constituting its walls. The necrosis appears to have been the result of osteo-myelitis. j, 104 224. An Os Calcis, of which a portion has been exfoliated after Necrosis. There is anchylosis between the os calcis and os cuboides. T. 109 225. An Os Calcis, in which there was Necrosis of a portion of the cancellous tissue. After the separation of the sequestrum, abscesses formed in and around the bone, and there was abundant deposit of new bone upon its surface. Ulcera- tion also extended through the superior articular surface of the os calcis • and anchylosis between it and the astragalus followed.

A Great Toe with its Metatarsal Bone removed by operation There has been necrosis of a portion of the interior of the metatarsal bone. The seques- trum lies within a cavity which is lined by soft and vascular granulations, and opens externally by fistulous apertures in the skin. The inflammation accom- panying the processes consequent on the necrosis of the metatarsal bone has extended to the first ]0mt of the toe, and completely destroyed the articular cartilages.

There is a chronic ulcer on the anterior surface of the leg. The skin around the ulcer is thin and adherent to the bone. The surface of the tibia is rough and thickened. At the base of the ulcer a considerable portion of black necrosed bone is exposed. On the surface of the section the necrosis is seen to extend through the whole thickness of the shaft, and a fracture passes through the necrosed bone, which is separated from the healthy bone by a distinct line of demarcation. The shaft of the tibia below the necrosed portion is sclerosed, and between the sclerosed and healthy bone there is a thin area of rarefied bone. The upper part of the shaft is condensed to a less degree. From a woman, aged 48 years. When eight years old, she had necrosis of the tibia ; a/piece of necrosed bone several inches long was removed, and she recovered completely. Three months ago the scar broke down, and an nicer formed, which exposed the bone. Fracture through the necrosed bone subsequently occurred and amputation below the knee was performed. There was no evidence of constitutional or acquired syphilis.—See Casualty Ward Book, vol. iv, p. 25, and President Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 153. 228. A section of a Tibia exhibiting Necrosis of the whole thickness of the shaft- beneath an ulcer of the integuments. Above the necrosed portion, the anterior surface of the shaft is exposed and carious. A portion of the posterior surface of the shaft is also necrosed, and a cavity exists here beneath the periosteum, which was filled with pus. Above and below the diseased part the bone is condensed. L ^ 229. A Tibia exhibiting Necrosis of a portion of its anterior wall. The dead bone, distinguished by its colour, is in process of separation from the living bone, a deep groove being formed between them. Its surface was m part removed by ulceration previous to its death. The walls of the bone, around the exfoliating portion, are thickened and of a porous texture. The necrosis was probably due to an ulcer of the integuments. L 64 NECROSIS OF THE LOWER JAW FROM EXPOSURE TO THE FUMES OF PHOSPHORUS. 230.

The disease and death of the bone were the result of exposure to the fumes of phosphoric acid twelve weeks previously. 232. Lower Jaw of a lad aged 18, with two left molars, removed during life on account of phosphorus-necrosis. The jaw was divided a little to the right of the middle line, and each half was drawn out of the mouth without difficulty, and scarcely any haemorrhage. The enamel is absent from the grinding surface of one of the two teeth, which appear porous. Some portions of the front sur- face of the jaw, especially of the right ramus, are coated with a pumice stone-like deposit. This specimen was taken from the same patient as No. 230.

SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING- THE PROCESS OF SEPARATION OF DEAD BONE. 236. Portion of a Tibia from a compound fracture, exhibiting the changes in the periosteum and bone preparatory to the exfoliation of the fractured extremity. The periosteum is thickened and appeared very vascular, and granulations have grown from its torn margin; a portion of it is detached and turned back, to show part s of the subjacent bone in a higher state of vascularity than is natural. Part of the extremity of the bone has acquired the peculiar white colour of dead bone. j 20 237. Portion of a Tibia from a compound fracture, exhibiting a somewhat later stage in the process of exfoliation of the broken extremity of the bone. The dead bone is distinguishable from the living by its peculiar whiteness; and its separation has_ been begun by the formation of a superficial groove in the adjacent margins of the living bone. Granulations have arisen from the exposed medulla. j 21 238. Section of a Tibia, exhibiting a part of the process of exfoliation after superficial Necrosis. The dead and exfoliating piece of bone is separated from the living bone in the upper half of its extent, and the space which has been here formed by the absorption of the surface of the living bone is occupied by soft vascular granulations. Beneath the lower part of the dead piece of bone there is an ulcerated groove, but no granulations. The granulations arising from the parts around the dead bone are large and spongy, and overlap its margins. I 2 239. Sections of a Tibia. A portion of its anterior wall has perished, and is surrounded by new bone, from which it may be distinguished by its smoothness and peculiar whiteness. Between the new bone and the deeper portions of the dead bone there is a large quantity of soft vascular granulations. I Q32 DISEASES OF BONES. 240. The lower half of a Tibia, which suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends lay at some distance from each other, and have been united by two lateral bridges of bone extended transversely between them. The necrosed end of the upper portion is almost exfoliated, and new bone is abundantly formed on the adjacent living bone. *• °° 241. Portion of a Tibia necrosed after a compound fracture, illustrating the process of exfoliation. The fractured end of the bone has perished. A deep and irregular groove has been formed around the limits of the dead bone, and a considerable deposit of osseous substance has taken place upon the contiguous living bone. " T 81 242. A similar Specimen. u ° 243. Sections of a Tibia, of which nearly the whole length and thickness of the walls of the shaft perished, and were in process of separation from the cancellous and medullary texture, which has preserved its vitality and is in a nearly healthy condition. The groove formed between the dead and the living bone is filled with soft and very vascular granulations. On the internal surface of the periosteum, spongy and vascular new bone is formed in a nearly uniform layer, to supply the place of that which has perished. The inner surface of this new bone is covered by vascular granulations. L *-9 The walls of the bone perished after inflammation of the periosteum produced by the application of nitric acid to a sloughing ulcer in the front of the leg. 244. Parts of a Femur. A portion of the whole thickness of the shaft of the femur, five inches long, died and was separated. The dead bone is contained in a cavity, which is formed in part by new bone, and in part by the surround- ing soft tissues. The formation of new bone has taken place chiefly at the remaining upper portion of the shaft, but has not extended the whole length of the femur ; a considerable space remains at the lower part, where this new bone is connected with the condyles only by soft granulation tissue. The internal surface of the new bone exhibits great vascularity; the external surface is rough, irregular, and covered, not by well-formed periosteum, but by tough condensed cellular tissue, a portion of which has been turned back at the upper part. The surface of the lower end of the femur, from which the dead bone separated, is covered with granulations. The cartilage has been almost completely removed from the condyles, but the bone thus exposed is not ulcerated. L ^ The patient was a lad 16 years old. General swelling of the thigh attended with severe pain had existed a year and a-half before his admission to the hospital. Abscesses formed, and finally amputation was performed through the trochanter major. A few days before the operation, the limb, by the complete separation of the sequestrum and the succeeding approxi- mation of the ends of the femur, became one-third shorter than it had been. The rest of the patient's history is in the case of James Macdonnel, in a paper by Mr. Lawrence m the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. vi, p. 174. London, 1815. The patient lived thirty years after the operation. For other Specimens, see Nos. 18, 19, 175, 178, 196, 211, 226, 229, 334, 335, Sfc.

A. 72 (In Case F.) 248. Section of a Tibia from a boy. There has been Necrosis of a large portion of the whole thickness of the wall. The largest piece of the dead bone has been removed from the cavity in which it lay, and is preserved in the following preparation. The outer surface of this piece of dead bone, as well as of that which remains in this specimen, is quite smooth, the periosteum baviug separated without any portions of bone attached to it. On the inner surface of the separated periosteum, a layer of new bone, half an inch thick, and. forming almost a complete new wall to the tibia, has been produced. The outer surface of this new bone is covered by the old periosteum, the continuity of which with that of the articular ends is shown ; and the inner surface of the new bone is lined by a soft vascular membrane, which was in close contact with the outer surface of the dead bone. A portion of skin is left, which formed part of the boundaries of an external ulcer, exposing the dead bone on the front of the leg. f) 133 Presented by Sir James M'Gregor. 249.

A large portion of the middle of the shaft of the tibia, including parts of its outer surface, and a much greater extent of its inner layers and cancellous^ tissue, has perished. A nearly complete wall of new bone, from half an inch to an inch thick, has been formed around the sequestrum ; its external surface is irregular; the inner is lined by Granula- tions. The new bone is of finely porous texture. L 3 251. Sections of a Tibia, in which large portions of the wall are separated after necrosis. The separated portions include the outer and middle lamina? of the wall; they are enclosed by new periosteal bone, which closely simulates the compact layer of the shaft. : 267 The patient was a feeble young woman 22 years old, in whom the necrosis had existed more than a year before she died with pulmonary disease. About six months before her death the presence of necrosis being suspected, in consequence of the large quantity of pus discharged through two minute apertures in the front of the tibia, a portion of the bone was cut awav with the trephine, and some sequestra were removed. The patient was for a time benefited bv the operation ; but the openings into the cavities containing the other sequestra remained and were only narrowed by the growth of new bone around them.

Section of the First Rib, taken from the same subject as the preceding speci- men. The enlargement is seen to be confined to the rib, the costal cartilage at the junction with that bone retaining nearly its normal size. The bone forming the enlargement is soft. 272. The Skeleton of an adult woman, showing, in a remarkable degree, many of the deformities consequent on Rickets. The dorsal region of the spine is strongly curved to the right side, and the lumbar region to the left; but the curve to the right predominates, so that the right ribs project an inch beyond the great trochanter, the chest thus overhanging the extremities. Together with the lateral curve of the spine, there is malposition of the bodies of the several vertebrae; they are all turned round, so that their front surfaces look outwards in the direction of the lateral curve in which they are included. The right side of the chest is encroached upon by the dorsal curvature of the spine. The angles of the right ribs are very acute, their bodies strongly curved ; the right intercostal spaces are very narrow. The angles of the left ribs are very obtuse, the ribs long and comparatively little curved, but directed down- wards, so that the cartilages of the false ribs are nearly on a level with the crest of the left ilium, and their bodies nearly in contact with the lower dorsal vertebras at the beginning of the second, or left, curvature of the spine. The general position of the chest is thus very oblique ; whab should be its vertical axis is directed from above downwards, from before backwards, and from right to left. The pelvis is light and all its bones are thin. It is obliquely placed, the crest of the left ilium being higher than that of the right, and its ala further back and more concave. The left side of the sacrum being narrower than the right, and the symphysis pubis in the middle line, the left side of the pelvis and of its'upper aperture are consequently less capacious than the right, The rami of the ischia curve outwards, and the lower aperture of the pelvis, though mis- shapen, does not appear unnaturally small. The scapulas and clavicles are slender and well-formed. The humeri are short and proportionately thick; the upper halves of their shafts present each a slight double curvature. The radii and ulnae are also short and slightly curved ; in comparison with the humeri they are slender. The bones of the wrists and hands are well formed. The femora are both curved, and very short; they are of equal length, but the left is slender, while the right is of full thickness. In adaptation to the oblique position of the pelvis (the right acetabulum being nearly an inch lower than the left, and half an inch more forward), the right femur is much more strono-ly curved than the left; and the right is curved outwards, while the left is curved forwards. By this adaptation the obliquities in the upper part of the skeleton are nearly compensated ; so that the knee-joints are at the same level \DISEASES OF BONES. 37 neither of them is advanced before the other; and, except that the articular surface of the right is more oblique than that of the left, they are symmetrical. The tibiae and fibulae are strongly but similarly curved forwards and inwards, so fehafc the shafts of the tibia' nearly touch. The lateral axes of the ankle-joints are directed from without inwards, and I'rum above downwards; and the internal malleoli are far within the tarsi and on a level with the lower margins of the astragali. The feet are in a corresponding degree splayed out, and their soles are nearly flat. A. 148 (In Case B.) 273. The Spine, Pelvis, and Lower Limbs of a woman, aged about 30, deformed by Rickets. The spine exhibits three lateral curvatures. The lumbar vertebras, inclining strongly to the left, are also twisted on their vertical axis so that the left transverse processes project forwards. The lower dorsal vertebras, inclining to the right, compensate for the preceding changes by having their right transverse processes directed forwards. The upper dorsal and the cervical vertebras tend to the right, and their transverse processes incline to the same directions as those of the lumbar, viz., the left forwards and the right backwards. From the manner in which the weight of the trunk has been transmitted to the pelvis, the sacrum has become nearly horizontal. The cavity of the pelvis is capacious; the ilia are everted; and the angle of the symphysis pubis is rather more acute than is natural. The femora are short and strongly curved, with their con- vexities directed forwards ; and their lower articular ends appear very broad and flat. The tibiae and fibulas are also curved with their convexities directed forwards and inwards. A 14 (In Case B.) 274. The Pelvis and Lower Extremities of a middle-aged woman who had suffered h orn Rickets. The bones are all strong, thick, and heavy, and not much curved. 1 Iiey are all short, and the shaft of the left femur is two inches and a half shorter than that of the right. The necks of the femora are horizontal, and their lower articular surfaces, especially that of the left femur, appear, as they do also m many preceding specimens, broad and flat.

A Pelvis and Femora, exhibiting extreme Rickety Deformity, from a woman on whom Caesarian section was performed. The anteroposterior diameter at the brim of the pelvis is only If inches. The femora are curved laterally, the greatest curvature being just below the trochanters ; the necks are short and hori- zontal, and, owing to the shallowness, and displacement from pressure inwards of the acetabula, the heads of the femora project prominently forwards. The condyles are distorted and flattened out. A- 164 The case is fully described in the Lancet, February 6, 1847. (In Case E.) 280. A Female Pelvis, the cavity of which is altered in its form and direction, so that the symphysis pubis is directly opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis. The change is presumed to be the effect of Rickets. There was a slight lateral curve of the spine. A- (In Case E.) 281. Sections of the Femur and Tibia of a Rickety Child. The bones which had become curved through a want of their natural hardness, have recovered their osseous texture and their inflexibility, but the curvature remains. In the femur, the walls of the bone in the middle and along the interior curve of the shaft have acquired a greater thickness than elsewhere. The tibia in the situation of the chief curvature is solid, and flattened from side to side. L 35 282. Section (cut with a knife) of the Femur of a Rickety Child, curved in con- sequence of the want of its natural hardness. The shaft, instead of the normal division into solid walls and medullary cavity, consists throughout of carti- laginous and gelatinous substances intermixed and disposed in cells. It is observable, that a greater quantity of the cartilaginous substance exists in the middle of the shaft and towards the interior curve than at any other part. The articular ends of the bone are in a natural state. I- 34 The two preceding specimens are described by Mr. Stanley in tbe Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. vii, p. 404, 1816. 283. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, from a child. They are all considerably curved from rickets, but have regained their natural firmness. There is a slight indentation with a circular thickening of bone, on the anterior surface of the lower extremity of the femur, which marks the situation of what appears to have been a united fracture. A- 138 (In Case F.) 284. A Femur, Tibia, and Fibula, from an aduit. They are considerably curved, but their texture is as hard and heavy as in health. The femur is curved in an arch with its convexity directed forwards ; the middle of its shaft is flattened at the sides, and the linea aspera in the same part is very prominent, its edge formino- a straight line representing the chord of the arc formed by the most curved part of the shaft. The tibia and fibula are curved inwards, and in the middle of their shafts present an antero-posterior flattening greater than the lateral flattening of the shaft of the femur. a. 139 (In Case F.) 285.

A Pelvis showing extreme distortion, the result of Mollities Ossium. The cavity of the brim is completely closed by the folding together of the ossa inno- minata: fractures appear to have occurred at the points where the bone is acutely bent. The sacrum is folded on itself in a similar manner. The bones are light, porous, and thin ; the walls of the femora are extremely thin.

Section of a Femur affected with Mollifies Ossium. The walls of the bone are very thin, and their substance so soft as to be readily divided by a knife. The osseous lamellae and filaments are removed from the cancellous texture; and the medullary cavity and all the cells of the cancellous texture are filled by a fatty substance, which is now, after maceration and the action of alcohol, of the consistence of lard. l- This specimen was taken from the same patient as No. 289. 294. Section of a Femur affected with Mollifies Ossium. The walls of the bone are thin, soft, and flexible, and their lamellae are partially separated. The place of its medullary and cancellous tissue is occupied by soft, jelly-like, transparent fat, of various shades of yellow and pink : some of it was deep crimson. A similar kind of fat appeared to be diffused through the proper texture of the walls. Scarcely any of the osseous part of the medullary texture remains, except a thin layer beneath the articular surface of the bone. The periosteum and articular cartilages are healthy. l- 233 295.

(In Case F.) * The absence of history renders the syphilitic nature of some of the following specimens doubtful, but they have been placed in this group because the appearances or other evidence point to a syphilitic origin.41 DISEASES OF BONES. (In Case F.) A. 13 298. Skeleton of a Negro of unusually high stature, who for many years suffered from constitutional syphilis. All the long bones of the extremities are thickened ami irregular, either generally or in parts, especially the right tibia ami fibula, the latter being covered with rough spicules of bone. The disease affects symmetrically the corresponding parts of opposite bones, but in a different degree. Amputation through the lower third of the right thigh was performed by Mr. Earle on account of syphilitic ulceration and periostitis of the right leg. The patient died soon after the operation. (In Case A.) 299. A pair of Clavicles. Extending over the greater part of the external surface of each, is an irregular deposit of porous new bone, by which their thickness is much increased. In many places the new bone is perforated by ulcers of various sizes, and through some of these the surface of the original shaft may be seen. A section of the left clavicle shows that the interior of the bone has become condensed and heavy from the deposit of bone in the cancellous texture.

A Skull exhibiting the effects of syphilis. The palate, septum nasi, and the lateral boundaries of the nose, are destroyed by ulceration extending as high as the middle turbinated bone. The outer table of nearly all the upper part of the skull is tuberculated and very extensively ulcerated, and in several places the ulceration has penetrated the inner table. A. 89 (In Case F.) 312. Parts of a Tibia, Clavicle, Humerus, and Skull, from a man who died with syphilis. The shaft of the tibia is enlarged by the expansion of its walls and by external formation of new bone. In one part, the walls and the new bone covering them are penetrated by small irregular ulcers. The same disease has affected the middle of the clavicle ; and in it the ulceration has extended so far that a slight force broke the remaining portion of its shaft.. In the humerus the lower half of the shaft is thickly covered by light and porous new bone, through which many ulcers of various size have penetrated: some of these extend deeply into the original wall of the humerus, portions of which also appear to have suffered necrosis. In the skull the outer tables of the frontal and right parietal bone present an uneven tuberculated surface, seamed and starred, like the surface of confluent small blisters ; through this, numerous distinct and coalescing ulcers penetrate, and reaching the diploe spread therein in wider spaces, and in a few instances pass also through the inner table. The outer table of the left parietal bone is tuberculated but not ulcerated. There is a similar but less extensive disease on the inner table of the right parietal and occipital bones. a. 34 (In Case E.) 313. The Skull, Femur, and Bones of the right upper extremity of a man who died with syphilis. They present, in a less advanced form, similar appearances to those last described. The tuberculated character which the outer table of the skull assumes, previous to its ulceration, is shown on the upper part of the frontal bone; and the stages in the progress of the little ulcers which penetrate and spread through the new bone, may be traced on the clavicles in which the process has just begun, and on the radius and humerus on which it is more advanced; while on the femur, whose shaft like theirs is much enlarged by the formation of new bone, there are many small round and oval apertures with smooth borders, indicating that similar ulcers have been healed. a. 35 (In Case F.) Presented by William Beaumont, Esq. 314. Portion of a Skull, in which nearly the whole surface of the outer table is tuberculated and ulcerated.

A Skull-Cap, exhibiting extensive syphilitic ulceration of its outer table. The ulcers are distinct, large, and round. Some of them, especially one on the frontal bone, show that they commenced in an annular form, an ulcerated groove forming round a portion of diseased bone, which portion was subse- quently removed by the widening of the groove.

A Skull, in which, in the course of Syphilitic disease, there occurred necrosis of several large portions of the frontal and parietal bones. Many of the sequestra were completely separated, and the surface of the diploe and inner table exposed by their removal appears to have healed smoothly; but many other portions in which the necrosis extends through both tables of the skull, are only partially detached. The portions of the skull, which remain behind those that have suffered necrosis, appear quite healthy: they were not even increased in vascularity. A. U2 (In Case F.) 334.

The cavity of the skull appears to have been small, especially in the parts beneath the external elevations. A. 37 (In Case F.) 349. Sections of a Skull-Cap, showing a similar change, but in a rather less degree. a. 43 The changes in this and the preceding specimen were probably due to congenital syphilis. (In Case F.) 350. Skull-Cap of a Foetus. There is a thin deposit of porous bone on the external surface along the margins of the sutures, especially the frontal, and in the temporal fossa. 351. The left Tibia and Fibula of the same Foetus, showing enlargement of then- shafts by the formation of a layer of porous, soft, chalk-like bone on their surfaces. The deposit is thickest at the middle of the tibia, where it forms a nodular enlargement. Microscopically it was found to consist of lamellae of bone vertical to the surface, in which the ossification was very irregular and incomplete. See Microscopic Sections, No. 7. 352. Several of the Long Bones from the same Foetus, showing with few excep- tions separation of the epiphyses from the diaphyses. The extremities of the diaphyses are soft, rough, as if breaking down, and the periosteum is in some instances separated at this point to a slight extent, leaving the surface of the bone rough and apparently carious. Sections show that the extremities of the diaphyses are infiltrated with a yellowish, granular material. The foetus, from which the bones were taken, was aborted at the sixth or seventh month from a woman, who had just been admitted into the hospital for a stricture of the rectum. The disease in the rectum was cured, but returned a year later. The disease in the bones of the foetus was believed to be syphilitic.

A Femur, on the middle of the shaft of which, on its outer and front aspect, is a large, flat, broad-based and pointed osseous growth, like the two following specimens. A" (In Case Gr.) 375. Sections of a Femur, and of a growth of bone from the outer side of its shaft. The growth has a broad base of attachment, and a smooth convex surface: one of its margins rises gently from the shaft, the other is sharp and overhanging. The section shows that the growth is almost entirely formed of compact°tissue, and is wholly external to the wall of the femur. Two plates of bone were found in the muscles close to the femur. They are preserved m Series VI, No. 1170. A- 129 (In Case Gr.) 376. Sections of a Femur from the surface of which an Exostosis has arisen. The growth is of a flattened, elongated form, attached by a broad base, and with pointed processes directed downwards : it presents a cancellous texture sur- rounded by a thin shell of compact bone. The walls of the femur and its medullary cavity in the situation of the exostosis are perfectly sound. I. 186 377. The lower part of a Femur, from the front of which a broad flat exostosis had grown, and was removed by operation. The surface from which the exostosis was cut is rough: it is formed of cancellous tissue of healthy aspect. The exostosis was composed of a similar tissue invested by a thin layer of compact substance. L 222 The upper margin of the base of the exostosis is very nearly three inches above the border of the articular cartilage of the trochlea of the femur ; but it was completely covered by the svnovial membrane, and the whole tumour projected into the cavity of the knee-joint. It had been growing for two or three years, and had produced great pain and frequent attacks ot inflammation of the knee-joint. The patient died with deep abscesses around the femur, about ten days after the operation. 378. An Exostosis removed from the upper part of a Femur. It was attached to the bone, just behind and below the lesser trochanter, by a low stem about an inch in diameter. From this stem it enlarges into an irregular deeply lobed and nodular mass, measuring from three to four inches in its several dimensions. It is composed of a light cancellous tissue, covered in most parts with a thin compact layer, on which, in one place, there appears a thin deposit of such new bone as is formed in inflammation. Where the cancellous tissue is uncovered, cartilage existed in the recent state. 35. 93 The patient was a man about 30 years old. The growth bad been slow and painless, but constant. Over the most prominent part of the tumour large bursal sacs were formed. Perfect recovery followed its removal. 379.

Its exterior is covered by a layer of cartilage. *■ ^'3 The exostosis had been united to the femur by a narrow neck, which, it is probable, was broken by external violence : for, in the operation, the narrow neck of the tumour was found51 DISEASES OF BONES. connected with the femur only by soft substance, and it fitted in an excavation in the femur upon which it had freely moved. 380. Sections of a Cancellous Exostosis which was removed from the inner and lower part of a Femur, to which it was attached by a narrow base. A layer of cartilage invests it, and is itself invested by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. i. 231 381. An Exostosis removed by operation from the Femur, just above the inner condyle, of a girl 16 years old. The exterior of the tumour is covered by a thin layer of dense fibrous tissue ; beneath this is a layer of cartilage enclosing the bone, which has a cancellous texture and contains medulla. i. 178 382. A large Exostosis removed from the inner and back surface of the lower end of the left Femur of a man aged 22 years. He had known of its existence for six years. It had lately grown very rapidly. There were nine or ten smaller tumours of the same kind on other bones. I. 329 383.

Section of a Cancellous Exostosis removed from the upper and inner part of a girl's Tibia. Its base and central part are formed of fine cancellous osseous tissue, and its exterior is formed of a layer of cartilage, like that of the foetal skeleton. i. 281 386. Sections of a Cancellous Exostosis removed from the Tibia ; it is covered by a thin layer of cartilage. I. 245 387. Part of the shaft of a Fibula, with a cancellous exostosis which grew from the fibular aspect of the tibia. The tumour, of somewhat spherical shape, and about an inch in diameter, was attached to the tibia by a narrow pedicle ; its surface is covered by a layer of cartilage. As it grew outwards, the fibula adapted itself to it, forming a curve and flattening itself over its convex surface. i. 299 The patient was a young girl. The tumour was of slow growth, and before removal was supposed to spring from the fibula, whose thinned shaft coidd not be distinguished from its surface. Recovery followed the operation. 388.

I. 316 From a young woman, aged 20, who was admitted to the Hospital with protrusion of the left eye due to the projection of the osseous growth at the upper and inner angle of the orbit The protrusion of the eye had been first observed three years previously. A portion of the growth was with difficulty sawn off, with the hope of producing necrosis and separation of the whole mass, but the patient died of meningitis. 397. Sections of the Bones of a Face, exhibiting an Osseous Growth filling up" the maxillary sinuses. The sections through the sinuses show a small cavity remaining in each, indicating, as the disease of the adjacent bones also does, that *their obliteration is the consequence, not of the growth of tumours into them, but of the thickening of their walls. The new bone by which they are increased in thickness is hard, nearly solid, and heavy; it is almost all formed on their inner surfaces; only a few small similar growths spring from their outer surfaces, and project on the face and into one of the orbits. The septum nasi and spongy bones are similarly thickened, enlarged, and very dense in their texture. L 62 398. A superior Maxillary Bone, in which the cavity of the antrum is completely filled up by a growth of porous or very finely cancellous bone. The external surface of the maxillary bone is superficially tuberculated and porous, and its w^alls are changed into bone of the same texture as that which occupies the place of the antrum. The disease is attended with general, but irregular enlargement of the maxillary bone ; its alveolar portion alone retains a nearly natural form. The palate-bone is healthy. I. 259 The patient was a girl 15 years old. Enlargement of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone had been observed for eight months, and was still increasing. The general health appeared good, and the disease was painless. The upper jaw was removed, and ten days after the operation the patient died with erysipelas- The case is related in Mr. Stanley's Treatise on Diseases of the Bones, p. 297.53 DISEASES OF BONES. 399. Portions of a superior Maxillary Bone, diseased like that last described, and which separated after Necrosis. The portions, before division, formed a nearly spherical mass of hard, heavy, and finely cancellous bone. I. 260 The patient was a man 37 years old. A smooth prominence of the nasal process of the right superior maxillary bone had been noticed for two years ; but it was not increasing, and lie was admitted into the hospital with what appeared to be necrosis of the alveolar portion of the jaw, and suppuration around it. After four months, this mass of bone, which occupied the position of the antrum, completely separated and was removed. The cavity which remained opening widely into both the mouth and the nose, gradually contracted or was filled up, and the man recovered perfectly. 400. A dense Osseous Tumour, involving the whole of the left superior Maxillary Bone. From a boy aged 9 years.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. i, p. 344. 401. A portion of the left side of the body of the lower Jaw of a child, corre- sponding with the canine and the first two molar teeth. Projecting from its external surface is a tumour composed of cancellous tissue covered with a layer of compact bone. The periosteum investing the tumour is greatly thickened, but was found under the microscope to be normal in structure . From a child 10 years old. A tumour of the jaw had been observed eighteen months, and a portion of it had been removed before she came into the hospital. On her admission the growth was increasing so rapidly and the parts over it were so vascular that it was feared it was of a malignant nature. The child recovered after the operation. 402. Portion of an Ulna on which a large Osseous Tumour has arisen from the whole of its articular surface between the olecranon and coronoid process. The tumour, compact on its surface and cancellous within, is lobed and irregularly nodulated. A. 136 (In Case G.) 403. Bones of the Fore Leg of a Horse, on which, are numerous nodulated and rough growths of hard bone. They form a very large mass around the distal extremity of the metacarpal bone. a. 154 (In Case G.) 404. Section of the Hind Leg of a Dog, in which the Knee- and Ankle-Joints are surrounded by growths, which consist of a substance like fibro-cartilage and of bone. I. 253 The substance overlying and intermixed with the osseous growth consists microscopically of fibrous tissue, composed of coarse intermingling fibres with distinct contour; probably a growth from the periosteum. 405. Section of the opposite Hind Leg of the same Log, with exactly similar growths. The soft parts have been removed by maceration. The osseous parts of the growths thus appear formed principally of crooked branching rods, like masses of coral round the joints. The bases of the growths are fixed on the surfaces of the articular ends of the bones; and bone, of the same general character, but much less abundant, is deposited on the patella, the shafts of the femur and tibia, and all the bones of the foot.

Microscopic examination showed that the tumour consisted of hyaline cartilage. Eemoved from an infant aged 9 months. When 3 months old his mother noticed an enlargement of the gum ; three months later the cheek began to swell and continued to increase in size. The child made a good recovery from the operation.—See Stanley Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 433. 408. Section of a Tumour, thirteen pounds in weight, which grew in front of the lumbar vertebras of a soldier 37 years old. It was loosely connected with the vertebras by its investing fibro-cellular tissue. It surrounded the aorta, and the inferior cava and iliac veins ; the veins were compressed and filled by coagula. It was of an oval form, lobulated, sixteen inches long, and about six inches wide. Half the tumour was composed of a soft, pulpy, and floceulent medullary substance of a brownish colour. A small portion of this is pre- served, and hangs in shreds; the other half of the tumour, including the greater part of that which is preserved, consisted of nodules of cartilage of various forms—rounded, oval, elongated, or quite irregular—and from one- fourth to three-fourths of an inch in diameter. These are invested and held together by layers of fibro-cellular tissue. They have both the obvious and the microscopic characters of foetal cartilage. In the centres of some of the nodules of cartilage there are small portions of cancellous bone, like the points of ossification of the foetal skeleton; the centres of others are rather softened. The limit between the cartilaginous and the medullary part of the tumour is well marked; and although they are in close contact, there is no appearance of any conditions intermediate between them, as if the one had degenerated into the other. In a portion of the tumour, not shown in this specimen, the softening process had reduced many of the nodules of the cartilage into a yellow viscid fluid, which was retained, as in thick- walled cysts, in the flbro-cellular investments of the softened nodules, and was in some instances mixed with blood. Presented by James Johnson, Esq. 409. Portion of a Spine, with a Tumour which, originating in the heads of the ribs, has extended into the cavity of the chest, and, through the foramina giving passage to the nerves into the vertebral canal, where it compresses the spinal cord within the arches of the fourth and fifth dorsal vertebras. That part of the tumour which projects into the chest is covered by a thick membrane, which apparently originated in the pleura costalis separated from the ribs ; a portion of this membrane has been removed. The tumour, which is probably composed of softened cartilage, consists of a gelatinous substance, in some parts approaching to the firmness of cartilage, and in others very much softer, and resembling boiled sago. l- H5 The patient was a man 30 years old. The compression of the spinal cord produced complete paralysis of the pelvic organs and the lower extremities. 410. Section of a Tumour which occupied the whole arm and shoulder. The section consists of a slice taken out of the middle of the tumour. A portion of the shaft of the humerus is destroyed; the head and upper part of the bone are imbedded in the tumour, which is also closely attached to the lower border of the scapula. The inferior angle of the scapula projects through an ulcerated aperture in the skin, in a state of necrosis. The greater part of the tumour is formed of a very firm, close-textured, and obscurely fibrous substance, glisten- ing on its cut surface, and in general appearance resembling fibro-cartilage. Portions of it are much softer, broken-down, and mixed with blood effused into them. In many of the firmer parts small deposits of bone have taken place. TheDISEASES OF BONIS. 55 head of the humerus is dislocated from the glenoid cavity, which is filled by part of the softer portion of the tumour.

There is a cast of the limb from which this preparation was taken, No. o. 411. A Cartilaginous Tumour of the head of the Humerus, for which the head and neck of the bone were excised. L 412. A man's Right Hand, with many cartilaginous tumours. Two or three in the metacarpal bones project in round bosses in the palm ; one or two are m the first phalanx of the thumb, and one of large size in the first phalanx of the fore-finger, or in the distal end of its metacarpal bone. The rest of the fore-finger, and the whole of the second finger, are buried in a large spheroidal tumour, nearly six inches in diameter, in which the walls of their phalanges are only just discernible. The outlines of the several distinct tumours, by the fusion of which, it may be presumed, this great mass was formed, cannot now be seen. The first phalanx of the third finger has one large tumour. The little finger appears normal. All these tumours are composed of nodules of firm bright cartilage, which, in the recent state, presented various tints of pale blue, pink, purple, and grey. In many interspaces among the nodules I here is much scattered cancellous bone, with yellow well-formed medulla. Over the dorsal surface of the large tumour there was a deep ulcer (as shown in the next specimen) ; but with this exception, the bones and all the other tissues surrounding the tumours appeared only expanded by their growth. i. 286 A drawing, No. 18, is preserved. 413. A Section of the largest Cartilaginous Tumour mentioned in the last descrip- tion. It shows part of the ulcerated surface of the tumour. A deep excava- tion is formed in it. The surface exposed is formed by the substance of the tumour, scarcely altered in texture, and having no covering of granulations. In the recent state, a thin layer of half-dried pus, or imperfect cuticle, covered it. I. 287 The patient, from whom this and the preceding specimen was taken, was a man 56 years old. The tumours had grown from his birth to the time of his attaining his full stature, and some of tnem were congenital. Besides these, he had had a tumour of two pounds' weight in the fore-finger of his left hand, which was removed when he was 16 years old. A tumour as large as a walnut still remained on the little finger of the same hand. The whole length of his left tibia had nodules on its anterior and inner surface, and some enlargement existed on his left second toe. None of his relatives had a similar disease. Presented by William Salmon, Esq. 414. The Right Hand of a lad 14 years old, in the bones of which are numerous cartilaginous tumours, like those in the preceding specimens. The metacai'pal bone of the thumb contains two such tumours of small size ; that of the fore- finger three or four, of which the smallest is an inch, and the largest three inches in diameter. The first and second phalanges also of the fore-finger con- tain similar tumours. The middle finger appears normal. The third finger has one tumour in its metacarpal bone, one in its first phalanx, and two in its second phalanx : the little finger has as many in corresponding positions: a section of that in its first phalanx, which is nearly three inches in diameter, is suspended by its side. All these tumours are alike formed of minutely lobed cartilage, pale grey, like that of the foetus ; in many of them are small scattered formations of cancellous bone, with medulla; all of them appear to have grown within the several bones, expanding parts of their walls and periosteum into thin osseous and fibrous investments.

Half the tumour has been removed from the investment or shell of bone and periosteum extended round it. I. 285 The tumours had been growing, without any known cause, from early childhood, till the hand and finger were amputated. Drawings of this and the two preceding specimens are preserved, Nos. 19, 20, 21. Presented, with the preceding, by Mr. Joseph Hodgson. 416. Sections of a Little Finger, and of the Metacarpal Bone of the Fore Finger of a lad 17 years old. The greater part of the cancellous tissue of the shaft of the metacarpal bone is filled with a minutely lobed, pale greyish mass of cartilage, like that of the foetal skeleton, which also, projecting through an absorbed portion of the wall, forms an hemispherical tumour rising from the shaft. A similar growth of cartilage exists within, and projects in a tumour beyond the first phalanx of the little finger; but in this instance the wall of the bone is not penetrated by the cartilage, but has grown in a thin layer around it. A poi-tion of the medullary tube of the second phalanx of this finger contains a similar growth of cartilage, but scarcely any external tumour or enlargement of the bone is observable. L 283 The patient had on his left hand four, and on his right hand six tumours such as these, but these alone were troublesome and increasing. The tumours had begun to grow when he was five years old, and their growth had been irregular, some increasing, while others remained st ationary. 417. An Enchondroma involving the first phalanx of the Middle Finger, removed from a woman aged 52 years. It had existed for about three years. 35. 141 418. Section of a Femur, and of a large spheroidal Tumour which has formed around it. In the upper part of the bone a fracture occurred several years before death. The two portions of bone overlapping have firmly united. The tumour, which nearly surrounds the middle of the shaft, is composed of fibro- cartilage. A portion of the same substance occupies the corresponding part of the medullary cavity, in which the disease has apparently commenced. I. Ill Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists of round and oval cells embedded in a matrix, which is for the most part fibrillated, but in places hyaline. See microscopic sections, No. 9 ; and drawing, A. 2. 419. The other Section of the Femur last described. Its walls are irregularly thickened, with expansion of their texture and deposit of new bone on their exterior ; and together with irregular cavities in the medullary tube, there is thickening and induration of its osseous tissue. r. 112 420.

The fracture has firmly united, with a perfect apposition of the ends of the bone, and without any obliteration of its medullary cavity ; but there is the same disease of the walls and the cancellous tissue as there is in the femur. i. 113 421. The other half of the preceding Specimen, macerated. r. 114 422. Section of a large Tumour growing from the lower part of a Femur, and composed of nodules of cartilage intermixed with osseous matter. Part of the morbid structure extends through the wall of the femur with which it is con- nected, and through the interior almost to the opposite side. I. 25 423. Section of a Femur, and of part of a large Enchondi^oma which closely surrounds it. The tumour exhibits various textures. The great part of it con- sists of a pale, whitish, firm sixbstance, traversed by fibres and mixed withDISEASES OF BONES. 57 spicula of bone; but in some parts its texture is much softer, and it has numerous small thin walled cysts imbedded in it. The texture of the bone itself is natural, except that its external surface is rough and deprived of periosteum, as if that membrane were involved in the tumour. I. 22 There isa cast of the limb from which this tumour was taken—No. 7. The tumour had grown rapidly but without much pain, and the patient recovered after the amputation of the limb. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists of a number of large round nucleated cells and free nuclei embedded in a scanty matrix, which is in places hyaline, in places partly librillated. See microscopic sections, No. 10; and drawing, a. 1.* 424. Section of a Tibia, and of a large Tumour which has formed around its upper third. One half of the tumour, the vessels of which have freely received the injection, is of a soft, fleshy, vascular texture. The other half, into which the injection has not so freely penetrated, consists of a mixture of cartilaginous and osseous matter, the cartilage being arranged in nodules, and exactly re- sembling that of the foetal skeleton. The morbid growth is very closely con- nected with the periosteum in the whole circumference of the tibia, and at the upper part the osseous portion of the tumour is continuous with the bone. The internal part of the tibia is sound. I. 41 Presented by William Brewer, Esq. 425. Section of a Tibia, and of a large Cartilaginous Tumour surrounding its upper two-thirds. The tumour is seated entirely between the bone and the extended periosteum ; the continuity of the periosteum with the investment of the tumour is distinct at the lower part. At its upper boundary the tumour borders the articular surface of the tibia, but does not encroach upon it. The cartilage is in nodules and irregular masses ; it is firm, elastic, shining, greyish, like ordinary foetal cartilage. At its upper part portions of cancellous bone are imbedded in it, and portions of similar bone have grown into most of those parts of the tumour which are in contact with the surface of the tibia. A large cavity within the tumour is irregularly bounded by nodules of cartilage, and by a coarse network of fibrous bands, the remains of partitions between portions of the tumour, the softening of which probably led to the formation of the cavity. All these tissues bounding the cavity appeared, in the recent state, soft, flocculcnt, and sloughing, and it was filled with brownish-yellow, putrid, (h composing fluid. The general shape of the tumour is spheroidal; its weight was twenty-four pounds. T. 288 The patient was a girl 14 years old. The tumour had been growing eighteen months ; and shortly before her admission into the hospital, and probably at the commencement of the putrefaction of the contents of the cavity within it, the integuments over it began to look in- flamed and dusky. On amputation of the limb, putrid gases were found diffused in the cellular tissue as high as the middle of the thigh. She died three weeks after the amputation with signs of purulent infection. ' A drawing, No. 22, is preserved. 426. Part of a Foot, with a large, soft, Cartilaginous Tumour occupying the place from which the metatarsal bone of the great toe had been removed on account of a similar growth involving it. The tumour is in two principal, and perhaps distinct, portions, invested with tough fibrous tissue, appearing locular through the number and strength of the partitions traversing it. The cartilage is soft, yellowish, transparent, and in some parts nearly liquid; while, from other parts, it appears to have escaped in the section, leaving cavities. 35. 94 427.

Walsham, Esq., by whom the sections were also prepare,!.DISEASES OF BONES. 58 Its surface is nearly covered with growths of bone that radiated into the car- tilage which had formed around it. 35. 95 The patient was a man about 60 years old. The tumour removed with the metatarsal bone was as large as an orange, and appeared to be simply cartilaginous ; but its cartilage was soft and jelly-like. The operation-wound healed ; but in about five months the disease reappeared at the scar, and increased rapidly. A small " cartilaginous cyst, filled with a kind of bloody jelly," formed, also, in the front of the leg, just above the ankle, and was attached to the tendon of the extensor pollicis. The patient recovered from the amputation of the foot. Presented by Dr. Ross. Vide No. 3262, Series L. CALCIFYING- OR OSSIFYING ENCHONDROMATA. 428. Sections of a Femur and an Os Innominatum, from which an Osseous Tumour of large size has arisen, principally from the Femur. It consists throughout of a very hard osseous substance with a compact surface and can- cellous interior. It is divisible into lobes, and its surface is nodulated. There lias been a fracture of the shaft of the femur, a little below the trochanter minor, which has firmly united. This fracture occurred before the growth of the tumour commenced. A much larger part of this tumour consisted principally of cartilaginous substance ; a portion of it is preserved in the following speci- men. A- 133 There is a cast of the limb from which the preceding specimen was taken, No. 6. (In Case Or.) 429.

I- H8 430. Masses of Osseous substance with small portions of the bones of the Pelvis upon which they had formed. The osseous substance consists of fine filaments, loosely cohering together ; it formed part of a large tumour, probably an osteo- chondroma, i. 189 431. Sections of a large Tumour, consisting of cartilage with specks and lines of bone interspersed in it. The greater part of it presents a nodular arrangement. 35. 5 432. Portion of a Femur, dried, with the surrounding muscles, among which, and with a slight attachment to the bone, the tumour last described had grown. Some pieces of the tumour, more completely ossified, remain imbedded in the intermuscular tissue. 35. 6 FIBROUS TUMOURS (FIBROMATA). 433. A right superior Maxilla, removed by operation from a girl, aged 26. The interior of the bone is filled by a firm fibrous tumour. Seven years previously a growth was removed from the alveolar process of the same bone. tThe microscopic characters of the growth were those of a fibrous tumour. See Lucas Ward Boole, vol. ii, p. 63. 434. A superior Maxilla, with a large oval tumour, which appears to have originated in its interior, and, in growing, to have disparted and extended its walls in every direction. The tumour, elongated from above downwards, pro- jected remarkably into the orbit, lifting up the orbital plate of the bone. It has a very dense compact texture, and a greyish basis, which is intersected by curved and reticulated shining white lines. Microscopically it consists entirely of well-formed fibrous tissue. I- 2^759 DISEASES OF BONES. The paticnl was a man 28 years old. The growth had besD observed moMaong for two years before its removal, [t was painless and did not affect the general health. It projected at the cheek, and into the orbit, nostril and month, and displaced all the molar teeth on its own side. He recovered from the operation and was well three years after it. Presented by Mr. White. 435. Sections of the left half of a Lower Jaw Bone, the walls of which are dis- parted and extended around a large oval tumour growing within them. The tumour extends from the right side of the symphysis, along the entire length of the left horizontal portion of the jaw, and about one-third of its ascending portion. It is uniformly of a very firm, dense substance, greyish-white, inter- sected by short shining bundles of white fibres. The investment of bone, formed for it by the extended walls of the jaw within which it grew, is com- plete, and might be separated from it. An appearance of softening in its centre is due to its having been perforated before removal. I. 280 The patient was a healthy-looking woman, 32 years old. The tumour ascribed to a blow, had been observed between seven and eight years, and had gradually increased without pain. Recovery followed the operation. 436. Part of the body of a Lower Jaw, and of a Tumour which extended from its angle to the place of the canine tooth, on the left side. The tumour appears to spring from both surfaces, as well as from the alveolar border of the jaw; it is intimately connected with them, and their periosteum is involved in it. It rises, with a nearly smooth oval surface, to a height of almost an inch from the jaw. Its texture is dense, tough, elastic, white, with glistening bands, like a section of fibrous cartilage. Its posterior and lower surface is covered with a thin plate of bone, which appears to have grown over it from the lower border of the jaw. 35. 92 The patient was a woman 28 years old. The tumour had been two years in progress and had seemed to spring from the socket of a tooth which was extracted on account of caries. For the first eighteen months it was painfid ; in its later progress much less so. The patient remained well for at least a year after the operation. Under the microscope the tumour was found to be composed of well-formed fibrous tissue. SARCOMATA. ROUND-CELL SARCOMATA. 437. Portion of the upper part of a Skull, with several large lens-shaped Tumours developed between the pericranium and dura mater, and partially involving the intermediate substance of the bone. The tumours are composed of a soft, but close-textured, smooth, medullary substance, which, on its cut surface, is ob- scurely fibrous, as if in each tumour there were fibres set vertically upon the surface of the bone to which it is attached. 35. 1 Microscopic examination showed the tumour to be a small round-cell sarcoma. See microscopic specimen, No. 11. 438. Section of a Clavicle, in the interior of which a firm medullary substance has been deposited in large quantity. The posterior wall is but little changed ; but the greater part of the anterior wall is lost in the interior of the tumour which grew to a great extent forwards. The shaft was fractured (with only a slight force), and its portions are widely displaced without any attempt at union. z 223 Microscopic examination showed the tuniour to be a small round-cell sarcoma. See microscopic specimen, No. 12. 439. The other Section of the same Clavicle after maceration. It shows more distinctly the characters of the osseous structure into which the anterior wall of the bone, which was chiefly involved in the growth, was changed. i 22460 DISEASES OF BONES. From a man 60 years old. Four years before death, the growth had the aspect of a small tumour growing within and expanding the walls of the clavicle. After this, enormous masses of a similar medullary substance formed around the clavicle, and in the subcutaneous tissue and other parts of the body. 440. Section of a Clavicle. Tbe sternal extremity is occupied, and surrounded by a small round-cell sarcoma. I- 347 See microscopic specimen, No. 13. 441. Sections of tbe upper balf of a Humerus, and of a Round-cell Sarcoma, which occupies tbe place of tbe sbaft of tbe bone. In one of tbe sections, a small portion of tbe diseased structure, distinct from tbe general mass, bas protruded through tbe wall of tbe bone. In tbe other section, the morbid structure is covered by the articular cartilage of the head of tbe bone. I. 49 See microscopic specimens, No. 14. The tumour in this instance had a constant and regular pulsation, the cause of which was not discerned in the examination of the limb. The case is related by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxviii, p. 304.. London, 1845. SPINDLE, AND MIXED ROUND AND SPINDLE CELL SARCOMATA. 442. Sections of a Tumour and of the portion of the Lower Jaw in which it originated; removed by operation. The portion of the jaw comprises its whole side, from tbe angle to within a short distance of tbe symphysis. The morbid growth consists of a grey, dense, fibrous substance, originating from the alveolar border and from the outer surface of the jaw. Part of the alveolar border of tbe bone has been absorbed; and in this situation the morbid growth appears to extend into its body. The contiguous substance of the jaw is of an ivory-like hardness, and its cancellous texture is consolidated. I. 149 From a female aged 30. 443. Sections of a Tumour which formed in the side of the neck immediately below tbe seat of tbe operation by which tbe parts last described were removed. The tumour consists throughout of a firm fibrous substance. The irregularity of surface and looser texture which it presents in one situation result from tbe ulceration and sloughing of its substance, wbich commenced a short time before death. With the smaller section of the tumour is connected a part of the lower jaw : its texture is sound, but the morbid growth is closely attached to its surface. L -^0 Microscopic examination of this and the preceding specimen showed them to be spindle-cell sarcomata. See microscopic specimens, Nos. 18, 19. 444. Part of a Lower Jaw, including one of its rami and its symphysis, imbedded in a large, firm, dense, pale and obscurely fibrous tumour, near wbich also are one or two smaller tumours of the same kind resting on its surface, but^not connected with the bone. The tumour projects with an ulcerated surface into the side and floor of tbe mouth, displacing the tongue and soft palate, and rising as high as the condyle of tbe jaw. I. 251 Microscopic examination showed that the tumour was a spindle-cell sarcoma. See microscopic specimen, No. 20. This and the preceding specimen were taken alter death from the patient from whom No. 412 was removed. She survived the operation about two years. Presented by Oeorge Ilarrison, Esq. 445. The Base and a portion of the Spine of a left Scapula, removed with a large tumour attached to both its surfaces. A section of the tumour bas been made, that portion of it being removed which lay nearest to the vertebral column : the whole length of the base of the scapula is deeply imbedded in the poi'tion which is preserved. The tumour is of nearly oval form, between six* DISEASES OF BONES. 61 and seven inches in length; its surface is nearly smooth and is connected with the adjacent tissues by a thin fibro-cellular investment. On its cut surface it presents a, pale, yellowish-white basis, which is intersected by a few thin parti- tions of fibro-cellular tissue, and is besides variously traversed by opaque white fibres. It is throughout firm, compact, elastic, and heavy, and bears a close resemblance to the fibrous tumours of the uterus, which it further resembled in yielding a Large quantity of gelatine and in its microscopic structure. 35. 51 About a year before the removal of this specimen tbe patient, a middle-aged man, had a large (inn tumour removed from beneath the base of the scapula. The wound healed, but shortly afterwards this tumour appeared and grew rapidly. After the second operation another similar humour soon grewj ami t he man died, with tumours attached to the internal surface of the ribs, beneath the seat of the former operations. Presented by E. C. Skey, Esq. 446. Sections of an elongated oval fibrous Tumour, very like the preceding speci- men. The resemblance extended to the microscopic and chemical characters. 35. 53 The tumour was removed from a lady 20 years old. It was situated beneath the trapezius muscle, and was closely attached to the spine of the scapula. It had been growing two years. The patient recovered from the operation. 447. A soft sarcomatous Tumour, surrounding the upper half of the shaft of a Femur. It has a well-defiued capsule. The ossified periosteum may be traced as a thin layer of bone through the middle of the section. In the middle of the upper third the whole thickness of the shaft of the bone has been destroyed by the growth. Microscopical Examination.—The tumour presents the characters of a sarcoma. Trabecular of spindle cells and fibrous tissue form alveoli, which enclose numerous small round cells. The specimen was taken from a boy aged 14 years. Eighteen months before admission to the Hospital, he became subject to occasional pain in the thigh, accompanied by slight swelling, which subsided with the pain. Ten months later pain and swelling of the thigh followed a slight blow on the part. From that time the swelling gradually increased, but was said to vary from time to time. Sudden variations in the patient's temperature occurred, it being some- times as high as 102-6°. These symptoms led some to the opinion that the disease was necrosis. Amputation at the hip-joint was performed and the patient made a good recovery.—See Rahere Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 286. See microscopic sections, No. 21. 448. Section of a Femur and of a Tumour surrounding the lower part of its shaft. The tumour consists of a mixture of medullary substance and a firm tissue like that of a fibrous tumour or fibro-cartilage with spicula of bone dispersed through it. At its posterior part are some thick-walled mem- branous cysts which were filled with coagulated blood. The injection of the limb has displayed minute vessels distributed irregularly through the tumour. The walls of the femur enclosed within the tumour are diseased, softened, and thinned to the extent of about two inches; and in this situation the shaft is broken, and the cancellous tissue is filled by a morbid structure similar to that which surrounds the bone. I. 97 Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists in great part of spindle cells. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 22 ; and a drawing, a. 5. 449. Section of the tumour last described. x> o,g The patient was 22 yearB old, an opera dancer, and the disease had existed about seven months. The tumour grew rapidly and with much pain. He died shortly after amputation of the limb ; and no other part was found diseased. 450. Section of the lower half of a Femur. An ossified sarcoma springs from the surface of the bone around the lower third of the shaft. The medullary canal is enlarged, especially at the lower part, where a sequestrum of cancellous tissue lies surrounded by granulations. Portions of the tumour were found to consist entirely of small spindle cells.62 DISEASES OF BONES. From a man aged 32 years. Swelling of the thigh, without pain, was noticed eight or nine weeks before his admission to the Hospital; he had received no injury to the part. Amputa- tion of the thigh resulted in the death of the patient. Secondary growths were found on the pleurse.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 84. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 23. 451. A section of the lower extremity of a Femur occupied and surrounded by a soft, gelatinous sarcomatous tumour, which in the recent state was of a pale pinkish colour. The tumour occupies the medullary cavity and projects out- wards through large openings in the wall of the bone, which is almost com- pletely absorbed. The histological elements of the tumour are small spindle-cells intermingled with a large proportion of mucous tissue ; the latter preponderates in the portion occupying the medullary cavity. The specimen was removed by amputation from a man aged 20 yeai's. Four months before admission to the Hospital he received a blow upon the inner and lower part of the femur ; soon after a tender circumscribed swelling appeared at this spot. It was at first thought that the swelling might be inflammatory, but its gradual increase in size revealed its true character.— See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 536. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 24. 452. The opposite section of the Femur after maceration. The wall of the bone has been almost entirely absorbed, and several delicate plates and trabeculee of bone project outwards. Many of these were accidentally broken away. 453. Section of a Tumour and part of a Tibia. The tumour occupies the situation of the head and the upper third of the shaft of the tibia : it apparently originated in the interior of the bone, and extended the wall around it as it grew. At the upper part, the articular surfaces of the tibia, and the ligamentum patellae may be recognized. The tumour consists in part of a white, solid, and very firm medullary substance, and in part of a more vascular and spongy substance, in which there are large cysts that were filled by a gelatinous fluid. i. 11G From a man aged 40. The limb was removed by operation. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists almost entirely of spindle cells, but in places tracts of round cells are seen. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 25 ; and a drawing, A. 4. 454. Section of a Tibia, with a very large tumour springing from the front and inner surface about the middle of the shaft. The surface of the tumour is nodulated and for the most part hard as bone. The section shows a large fleshy mass springing from the anterior surface of the tibia, and projecting forwards and downwards ; it contained numerous spicula of bone : a small mass covered by a thick layer of bone also projects from the posterior surface. The bone, where surrounded by the growth, is extremely indurated, and its outline is irregular, the more so as a fracture occurred at this point, the line of which can still be distinguished. The tumour, which was a fibro-sarcoma, consisted of immature fibrous tissue, containing very numerous round and fusiform nuclei, and some spindle cells. The limb was removed by amputation from a woman, aged 72 years. The tumour was first noticed eight years before her admission to the Hospital. It appeared shortly after she had sustained a fracture at the middle of the leg. Three years later she again fractured the same leg lower down.—See President Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 76. Microscopic sections of the tumour are preserved, No. 26. Vide No. 3305a, Series L. SARCOMATA CONTAINING MYELOID CELLS. 455. Portion of the upper part of a boy's Skull, and of a large tumour involving it, and pressing inwards upon the brain. The section was made transversely from ear to ear, through the skull, tumour, and brain. The tumour, half of which is here shown, formed on the exterior of the skull a layer from one to two inches thick, which covered the whole vertex, from the occipital spine toDISEASES OF BONES. the coronal suture, and from one squamous suture to the other. Within the skull it formed a layer, in about two-thirds of the same extent, and of the same general shape, gradually increasing its depth and thickness from its borders to its central part. That part of the tumour which is external to the skull has a nearly uniform, dense, firm, and elastic texture of dull yellowish colour mingled with ' white ; it appears neither lobed nor granular, nor fibrous. The intra' cranial portion appeared in the recent state more plainly than it does now, soft, and medullary, with a fibrous grain vertical to the surface of the skull. It was much more vascular than the extra-cranial portion, had a dark purple or livid colour streaked with pale grey and pink, and near the skull was intersected with white bands of fibres of the dura mater. The microscopic characters of both portions of the tumour agreed, in all essential respects, with those of the fibro-plastic tumours (myeloid sarcomata). The scalp adheres closely to all the parts of the tumour that it covers ; but at the centre of the vertex is destroyed by a wide and deep ulcer penetrating the substance of the tumour. The pericranium is completely involved in the tumour and cannot now be traced. The texture of the parietal bones, as shown more plainly in the next specimen, is expanded and made irregularly cancellous, by the formation of substance within them like that of the tumour on their surfaces ; and from both their surfaces fine growths of bone extend into the corresponding parts of the tumour. The dura mater is involved in the substance of the intra-cranial portion of the tumour, but is less completely lost sight of than is the pericranium ; parts of the falx and of the walls of the longi- tudinal sinus may still be traced. This intra-cranial part of the tumour is deeply imbedded in the cerebral hemispheres, and adheres closely to parts oP their surfaces ; there is no confusion from infiltration of the brain substance, but that of the hemispheres appears compressed and absorbed. On the left side a large cavity, which contained pus, exists between parts of the tumour and of the surface of the brain. It was lined with vascular granulations. T. 203 456. The other half of the upper part of the same Skull, macerated and dried. It shows more perfectly the expanded state of the portions of bones involved in the tumour, and the new bone grown up from their surfaces. This new bone forms a layer from one to four lines in thickness, and is composed of fine lamellos and fibres, the chief of which are set almost vertically on the skull, and of which the general shape and arrangement are exactly like those of normal cancellous tissue or of light bone formed in periosteal inflammations. l. 294 The patient was a farmer's boy, 15 years old : the tumour was of nearly three years' duration, and was ascribed to repeated blows on the head. It increased regularly, and in the last three months was attended with severe pains in the head, and with gradually increasing imperfection of walking and other movements, and of the sight and hearing. Two days before death convulsions ensued, and these were followed by coma. In addition to the appearances already described, extensive suppuration was found in the tissue of the pia mater. 457. Section of the anterior part of a Lower Jaw, and of a tumour formed within it. The anterior and posterior walls of the jaw are disparted, and form a thin layer, like a capsule of bone, around the tumour which has grown between and gradually expanded them. Their tissue appears unchanged. The tumour is of oval form, and measured about two and a half and one and a half inches in its chief diameters. Its substance is generally firm and compact, without any distinct fibrous or other texture; immediately after removal it had a greyish tinge, suffused with deep crimson, brownish and purple blotches; it presented the microscopic characters of a "fibro-plastic" tumour (myeloid sarcoma). The cut surface of the tumour presents the sections of several cysts which were irregularly placed within its substance, and were filled with clear yellowish fluid. x. 273DISEASES OF BONES. 64 The patient was a lad 18 years old. The tumour had been observed gradually increasing, without pain, for eight months, and projected into the mouth through one of the alveoli lhe portion of the jaw that was removed included the first true molar tooth on the left side, and the first bicuspid on tne right, all the intermediate teeth being in their places. The patient remained well for more than four years after the operation. 458 Section of the forepart of an Upper Jaw, with a tumour having the same general and microscopic characters as that last described. The tumour seated within and above the alveolar part of the jaw has separated and extended, m its growth, the anterior and the palatine walls of the bone, which form a kind of bony investment to it. L The patient was a girl 20 years old, of healthy appearance. The tumour had been observed as a projection in the left nostril, ten weeks before it was removed. Presented by Benjamin Barrow, Esq. 459 Portion of an Upper Jaw, including nearly the whole of its front wall, extended over a laro-e tumour, which presented the same general and microscopic struc- tures as the two preceding, except in that its substance had almost uniformly the colour of voluntary muscle. Nearly the whole of this colour was quickly discharged as if by bleaching, when the tumour was immersed m alcohol it now presents a uniform pale colour, and a firm, compact substance, m which portions of cancellous bony tissue are irregularly scattered. I. tf& The patient was 22 years old. Growths, like common epulis had been thrice removed from her right upper jaw before the growth of this tumour was observed The last of the three growths exSnded through an alveolus into the cavity of the antrum, which it nearly filled. All, howTver appeared to be removed, and the wounds of the operation healed soundly Nine welk^afterwards, this tumour in the right upper jaw-bone was observed expanding it in all toec ionT It regularly increased, and about two months later a similar tumour appeared in the left upper law-bone also. Both tumours grew rather quickly. Six months after the appearance of the first of them, the greater part of the jaw-bone was cut away anSn' the part here preserved), and the rest of the tumour, which appeared to fictile whole interior of the jaw-bone was removed piecemeal. The wound healed soundly, Jnd urin-the nine months following the operation no reproduction of the growth had taken Xce the tumour in the left upper jaw-bone had somewhat diminished and become harder, and two small swellings which had long existed on one of the parietal bones, disappeared. 460 Sections of a Tumour with the portion of the Lower Jaw in which it origi- Wed • removed by operation.

A Myeloid Sarcoma springing from the upper extremity of the Humerus. The deltoid muscle is reflected, exposing a large, soft, brain-like tumour, which surrounds the head and upper third of the shaft of the humerus. It is covered by a definite capsule. The growth extended forward beneath the pectora l is major on to the wall of the thorax, which it penetrated; it fills the axilla surrounding the large vessels and nerves, and extends backwards into the sub- stance of the teres minor. Occupying its centre is a portion of the shaft of the humerus about one inch long, which is separated from the head above by a considerable interval, and from the lower portion of the shaft by a fracture. The enclosed portion of bone is rough, eroded, and infiltrated. The shoulder- joint is not involved. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour is composed of large roundish or oval cells of the most various size and very irregular shape, with little or no intercellular material. Myeloid cells are thickly scattered in some parts of the tumour. A nucleus is visible in the majority of the cells ; the larger ones are multi-nuclear. A band of immature connective tissue, containing small round nuclei, is here and there cut across. From a man aged 48 years. Sixteen months before his death he became subject to cutting pain in the shoulder ; nine months later a swelling appeared. He gradually lost power of movement in his right hand, the fingers tingled and the right pulse at the wrist was smaller than the left; the forearm was (edematous. Crepitus was felt on moving the upper arm. The supra-clavicular glands were enlarged. Post Mortem.—The tumour was found to have made its way through the wall of the thorax involving the apex of the right lung. Numerous firm secondary deposits were scattered throughout the lungs and liver.—See Luke Ward Book, vol. ix, p. 250. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 30. 463. A large mass of sloughing and bleediag Sarcoma, connected with the bone, axilla, and the adjacent glands, which formed after the removal of the head of the humerus with a myeloid sarcoma about the size of an infant's head, and in most parts encapsuled by a thin layer of bone. This growth consisted of myeloid and spindle cells. The shortening of the humerus in the preparation is due to the above-mentioned removal of its upper third. Its shaft is healthy, and is united to the lower edge of the glenoid cavity by a small ligamentous band permitting of free movement. i. 304 The growth preserved consists of spindle-cells. The parts were obtained from a woman, aged 33, who, six years before her death, was supposed to have sustained a fracture or dislocation of the head of the humerus. To this succeeded permanent loss of motion, and gradual enlargement about the part. This growth was spontaneously arrested during four years. Subsequently resection of the upper part of the humerus, of the tumour, and of some diseased glands was resorted to. The operation was recovered from, but the disease was rapidly reproduced in four different situa- tions. She died four months after the section, from an enormous mass of sloughing and bleeding cancer, connected with the bone, the axilla, and the adjacent glands. Microscopic sections of the growth are preserved, No. 31 ; and a drawing, a. 11. Presented by Mr. J. Hutchinson, by whom the case is fully related in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. viii, p. 346. 464.

Winkficld, Esq. 465. Section of the lower end of a Femur, in which nearly all the cancel- lous tissue within the condyles and for a short distance up the shaft is removed, and its place occupied by a mass of brain-like medullary substance. The greater part of this substance is nearly white, but there are many spots in it ot a deep red colour, from effused blood—a cyst in process of formation ; and at the upper part is a section of a small cavity which was filled by a soft gelatinous material. The growt h of the mass has expanded the internal condyle and t he posterior part of the femur into a large round sae, of which the walls are Ft3G DISEASES OF BONES. partly formed by the articular cartilage and the periosteum.

A Section of the lower part of a Femur, and of a brain-like Tumour, which has grown within the condyles and has extended them m a large thm-walled cavity. The tumour projects chiefly backwards and laterally; a part ot it is covered by the articular cartilage of the femur, which is extended over itMt m the middle, between the condyles, the cartilage is perforated by the morbid growth penetrating into the knee-joint in front of the crucial ligaments.

Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 33 ; and a drawing, A. b. 467. Sections of the lower part of a Fibula, with the Tibia and Astragalus The walls and periosteum of the lower end of the fibula including the malleolus are extended into a thin osseous and fibrous capsule, by the internal growth of a tumour composed partly of cartilage and partly of nbro-plastic tissue (mye- loid sarcoma). The tumour is of oval shape, and measures about three inches by two; its surface is knobbed, and exactly fitted to the interior ol the bone extended around it, yet not so firmly united but that they could be cleanly separated, as in the" upper section here shown. The cut surface of the tumour displays the greater part of its mass formed of pale greyish, glisten- il cartilage, while the remainder, mingled with the cartilage m no regular ar?angement, is pale pinkish-white, more vascular, softer, and obscurely fila- mentous. ' The patient was a young man. The tumour had grown slowly and pulsated distinctly probabFy S impulses communicated to it from vessels m xts interior ; for there were no large vessels external to it from which extensive pulsations could be derived. Presented by Langston Parker, Esq. 468. A Section of the upper part of a Tibia, and of a large Medullary Tumour which has formed within it. The tumour consists partly of a soft, brown, fibrous-looking substance, and partly of coagulated blood ; and there are some small cvsts in it. A thin crust of the expanded walls of the bone surrounds the tumour Upon the upper part of it, in the situation of the articular surface of the tibia, there is a deep excavation which lodged one of the condyles of the femur. The diseased structure appears to have originated m the cance - lous tissue of the head of the tibia, and is exactly circumscribed; the shaft below it is healthy.

Microscopic sections are preserved, JNo. d*. 469 A large round-cell Sarcoma nineteen inches in circumference at its greatest diameter, affecting the upper end of the tibia and, slightly, the lower end of the femur, with the crucial ligaments. _ The tumour presents numerous cysts with smooth lining membranes, which contained when fresh a yellowish or chocolate-brown viscid fluid It consists of a hard part composed of earthy matter deposited here and there in considerable amount, but with no indication of true ossification, and a soft part presenting the characters of a round-cell sarcoma with a few myeloid cells and many cells of irregular form and size. *o< 14/ See Abemethy Ward Boole, vol. ii, p. 337.67 DISEASES OF BONES. 470. The upper third of a Tibia divided vertically. Projecting upon its inner aspect is a considerable tumour, covered by thickened periosteum. The growth extends half-way across the head of the bone, taking the place of its osseous tissue. Above, it reaches to, but does not involve, the articular cartilage. Below, it extends on the outer side of the bone, between the compact wall and the periosteum. The cancellous tissue around is condensed. The tumour is composed of a firm, tough material, of a dull grey colour, traversed by numerous blood-vessels. It is formed, chiefly, of cells having the character of those observed in malignant growths, mingled with others of the myeloid variety. During life it was distinctly pulsating. I. 306 The patient, a girl aged 17, had undergone the operation for tying the femoral artery. Subsequently there was profuse haemorrhage from the wound. Death resulted from the in- tercurrenee, during convalescence, of an attack of continued fever. The progress of the disease was in no way affected by the ligature of the artery. The case is related in the Hospital Reports, vol. vi, p. 381. 471. Section of the upper part of a Tibia, within the head of which a nearly spherical tumour, about four inches in diameter, has grown. The greater part of the substance of the bone has been absorbed during the growth of the tumour, round which its remains are extended in a thin wall of bone and periosteum. The articular surface is unchanged, but nearly all the layer of bone beneath the cartilage is absorbed. The chief part of the tumour consists of close-set, thin- walled cysts, the cavities of which were filled with bloody fluid. Other parts, around and between the cysts, consist of soft, opaque-white, brownish and yellow substance variously tinged with blood. A few bands and thin plates of bone traverse the space thus filled with cysts and solid growth. The upper parb of the shaft of the tibia appears healthy, which is immediately below the part extended round the g'rowth. The microscopic structures in the solid parts of the tumour, and in the walls of many of the cysts were chiefly many-nucleated cells, and spindle cells, like those characteristic of myeloid or fibro-plastic tumours. I. 298 The patient was a woman 24 years old. The first sigu of the disease was severe pain in the head of the tibia. This was observed eighteen months before the removal of the limb, and after it had existed ten months a swelling appeared, which regularly increased; the paiu rather diminished, but the limb became constantly more feeble and unable to support the bodv. Recovery followed amputation. 472. Section of the lower part of a Tibia and of a Tumour contained within it. The tumour consists of a brain-like substance, with blotches of blood effused in it, and is almost completely surrounded by a thick osseous lamina which is con- tinuous with the wall of the tibia. It may be presumed that the morbid deposit commenced in the interior of the bone, and that, as it grew, so also the bone grew around it, with internal absorption and external deposit of new bone, and thus formed the osseous wall. The arteries of the limb are injected; some of their branches pass through the morbid growth. \, 159 The microscopic characters of the tumour are those of a myeloid sarcoma. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 35 ; and a drawing, a. 10. 473. The other half of the Tibia and of the Tumour last described.

A section of the lower half of a Femur, and of an Osteoid Tumour (osteo-68 DISEASES OF BONES. sarcoma), which has formed around it. The tumour consists almost entirely of a solid, uniform, and very dense osseous substance. The medulla cavity ot nearly all that part of the hone which is surrounded by the tumour is failed by a similar substance, and about the condyles, the walls of the femur being absorbed, the morbid growths within and without form one mass. A part ot the exterior of the tumour is composed of a soft, fatty-looking substance. ^ Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists of a reticulum of homogeneous inter- cellular substance, enclosing small round cells. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 36 ; and drawing, A. 14. 475 The other Section of the Femur and Osteoid Tumour last described By maceration, the soft matter of the tumour has been removed, leaving only the hard, dense, and white osseous substance around and witmn the bone, ine outer surface of this portion of the tumour is nodulated, and portions ot it have a fibrous texture like that of pumice-stone. In the lower part of the bottle are several of the inguinal and lumbar lymphatic glands from the same side ot the body as the tumour. They are converted into an osseous substance similar to that of which the tumour is composed. L 476 The Femoral Artery, together with several Bony Tumours which occupied the situation of the lymphatic glands in the popliteal space and groin of the patient from whom the two preceding specimens were taken. The tumours consist of a hard osseous substance, which is displayed by a section of one ot them, llie femoral artery is sound, but its popliteal portion is compressed and altered m its course by its connection with the diseased glands. The ligature upon the artery about three inches below the origin of the profunda, was placed around it in consequence of the tumour in the ham having a pulsation and other characters like those of an aneurism. L The minute structure of the growth in the lymphatic glands resembles exactly that of the primary tumour. .

The femoral ar ery was compressed andXplacefby the diseased glands. The case is recorded by Mr. Stanley, m the MecUco- Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxvm, p. 305, 1845. 477 Section of a Femur, of which the lower half is surrounded by an Osteoid Tumour (osteo-sarcoma). The tumour extended around the whole circum- ference of the femur. It has an elongated oval form, is thin where it abuts on the articular margin of the bone, but, in the rest of its extent, rises to between two and three inches from the surface of the shaft. The periosteum appears to be involved in the tumour, and the popliteal artery and vein run through it near its surface. The walls of the femur appear thickened and hardened, and We portions of morbid substance, like that which forms the external por- tions of the tumour, exist in the cancellous tissue and medullary canal, l ie greater part of the substance of the growth, both without and within the walls of the bone, consists of a very firm, dense, and compact tissue, pale yellowish, and obscurely fibrous ; that part which is attached to the femur is chiefly osseous, its tissue having peculiarities which are better shown in the following speci- men The outer surface of the tumour is unequal and knobbed, and a few portions of similar substance lie adjacent to, but distinct from, the chief mas* Microscopic Examination.-The tumour consists of small round cells and homogeneous or indistinctly fibrillated intercellular substance having a reticular arrangement. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 38; and a drawing, A. 12.69 DISEASES OF BONES. 478. The other section of the same Femur dried after maceration. The osseous parts of the tumour appear as irregular outgrowths from the femur, or as deposits on its surface. On their surfaces they are brittle, lamellar, and in parts like pumice; more deeply, the chief growths are hard, very compact, and i\ on -like. Similar formations of hard bone occupy a portion of the cancellous tissue of the shaft, and its walls in the corresponding situation are similarly hard and ivory-like. In other parts, the walls of the shaft are more porous than is natural, as if they had been abnormally vascular. I. 270 479. Section of the upper Third of the same Femur. In the cancellous tissue near its great trochanter there is a small circumscribed mass of fibrous-looking substance, like that of which the greater part of the tumour in No. 477 is composed. I. 271 480. Section of a mass of inguinal Lymphatic Glands, taken from the same patient as the three preceding specimens. They are greatly enlarged, and their proper tissue is replaced by a very firm and compact pale substance, which is, in parts, obscurely fibrous, and altogether resembles very closely the principal mass of the tumour round the femur. The femoral artery and vein pass through the middle of the diseased glands. I. 272 The four preceding specimens were taken from a man 45 years old, of unhealthy aspect. The tumour round the femur had been observed for five months, and was so painful that he solicited the removal of his limb, though dissuaded on account of the disease in his inguinal glands. He lived two months after the amputation, and, in addition to those shown in Noa. 179 and 480, masses of substance resembling the tumour round the femur were found in the place of other inguinal and lumbar glands, and in the lungs. In many instances these masses contained osseous as well as the apparently fibrous tissue. The case is related by Mr. Stanley in his Treatise on Diseases of the Hones, p. 168. 481. Section of the lower half of a Femur surrounded by an osteo-sarcoma. The whole circumference of the shaft, between the periosteum and its walls, is enveloped by the malignant growth, which, in a layer from half an inch to nearly two inches in thickness, forms a large firm tumour of elongated oval shape. The greater part of the tumour is almost pure white, very firm, and compact; but in the parts nearer to the bone, it is extensively osseous, and the greater part of the osseous tissue of the growth appears to have extended into it from the surface of the shaft on which it rests. To the same extent in which the femur is thus surrounded with the growth, its medullary canal is filled with hard, white, and finely porous bone, formed, apparently, by the almost complete ossification of the new growth. Between the lamina? of the walls, also, a similar substance exists, separating them; and at the lower part so altering them, that the morbid structures around and within the shaft are combined in a continuous mass. The epiphysis is healthy. i. 295 The microscopic structure of the soft parts of the tumour is that of a spindle-celled sarcoma. The osseous substance was true bone with well-formed lacunuc. The patient was a girl 12 years old. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 39 ; and a drawing, a. 13. 482. The other portion of the same Femur, macerated and dried.

CANCERS INVOLVING BONES. EPITHELIAL CANCER. 486. Section of a Leg, exhibiting a soft, vascular, warty growth from its front part. The base of the growth is consolidated with the periosteum, which, for some distance above and below, has become soft and spongy and has its connection with the bone loosened. The bone itself is healthy, except that there has been an irregular ulceration of its external surface. I. 42 487. Portions of the Tibia and Fibula, from the leg last described, more plainly showing the ulceration of their anterior surfaces. L 42a From a woman 35 years old. She received a blow on the shin when 10 years old, which was followed by abscess and discharge of small pieces of bone. The parts healed and remained well for many years ; but again abscess formed, and again healed; and after this had been several times repeated, the growth here shown sprouted out, and, the patient's health failing, the limb was removed. 488. Section of a Tibia, with the soft parts covering it, exhibiting the effects of Epitheliomatous Ulceration. The section was made longitudinally through the middle of the tibia. The other half of the tibia and the fibula are in the next preparation. By viewing the two preparations together, it will be seen that the ulcerative process has extended completely through the body of the tibia, in a great part of its length, and has reached the fibula, as is evinced by the peculiar excavated appearance of its surface. No attempt has been made to restore the lost bone ; there is merely a slight deposit of bony matter upon the surface of the fibula, opposite to that which is in progress of ulceration. The interosseous ligament is in part converted into bone. The integuments around the hollow which has been left by the ulceration are much changed in struc- ture ; they are swollen, and the margins of the hollow are formed by very vascular, coarse, and hard, warty granulations.

Lower end of a Tibia, invaded by a new growth, probably Epithelioma. The integument covering the bone presents the appearances characteristic of this form of cancer : it is infiltrated, irregularly ulcerated, the base of the ulcer beino- covered by fungous granulations. The ulceration appears to have extended through the skin and exposed the bone, the surface of which has been extensively destroyed, and an oblique fracture passes through it at this point. The lower end of the bone nearly as far as the articular surface is infiltrated throughout by the morbid growth and is of a yellowish-white colour, soft and crumbling. The upper fragment is invaded to a slighter extent. t. 78 The history of the case is unknown.DISEASES OF BONES. 71 491.

Section of a Frontal Bone, with numerous lens-shaped Tumours, of various sizes from a line to two inches in diameter, thickly scattered through its sub- stance. They grow from both surfaces, and from the substance of both tables; there were also several in other parts of the skull, and some on the dura mater. The tumours consist of a soft medullary matter, and in many of them delicate osseous fibres, standing vertically on the surface of the skull, are embedded. In the situation of the largest tumoui*, parts of which grow from corresponding portions of both tables of the skull, a similar medullary substance is diffused thi*ough the diploe. i. 248 The microscopic structure of the tumour is that of medullary cancer. It consists of an alveolar stroma of fibrous tissue, enclosing epithelial-like cells, sometimes arranged like an epi- thelial lining around the margin of the alveoli.

The rib cannot be traced in it. $5. 103 The patient was an adult male. The tumours had been observed for several years ; but they had scarcely enlarged till shortly before death, when they rapidly increased, and numerous medullary tumours appeared about them and in more distant parts. 500. A Section of the Sternal End of a Clavicle and of a Medullary Cancer con- nected with it. The tumour had been observed for nine months, in the first six increasing gradually, and for the last three months rapidly. The parts were removed by operation from a lad. He made a good recovery, and when he "left the Hospital was able to use the arm well. 500a. Section of a Humerus, around the middle of the shaft of which a firm obscurely fibrous medullary cancer has formed. Within the tumour the texture of the humerus, apparently infiltrated with medullary matter, is soft and brittle, and was broken during life by a slight force. The disease extends for a short di stance into the medullary canal above and below the fracture, and a small round mass of new growth, like that investing the shaft, is embedded on the inner surface of the wall. *• ^50 From an old lady who had suffered for some months from pains like those of rheumatism in the arm. She died shortly after the fracture of the humerus. See microscopic sections, No. 43; and a drawing, A. 19. Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq. 501. Section of an Ilium and of a Medullary Tumour covering a large extent of both its surfaces and extending through its substance. The tumour is of oval form, and reaches from the crest of the ilium to near the margin of the aceta- bulum. It is composed of a soft, spongy, and floccnlent, reddish medullary substance in which a few small cysts are scattered. It is covered in by the thickened periosteum of the ilium. At its centre the substance of the ilium is irregularly broken and absorbed, so that here the tumours on each side of the bone are connected into one mass by the morbid substance diffused through its texture. Portions of the iliacus and gluteus medins muscles are left connected with the periosteum, over which they were spread out in the growth of the tumour. L 235 502. Another Section of the same parts. A portion of the tumour has been so removed as to show the surface of the wall of the ilium on which it rested, and parts of which are absorbed in minute round holes and irregular spaces, through which the growth without appears to dip in, and be connected with that within the ilium. L 236 503. Another Section of the same Ilium macerated, to show the same partial absorption of its walls, and the other changes which it has undergone by the growth of the tumour. L 23 * 504.

The place of the l ight ala of the sphenoid bone, and of small portions of the bones adjacent to it, is occupied by hard, greyish, cancerous substance, which nearly retains the shape of the bone that it has involved. Similar cancerous substance covers, with a thin granulated layer, parts of both surfaces of the dura mater, the tissue of which also appears similarly diseased. I. 292 The patient was a spare, sallow man, 45 years old. The cancer of the breast had existed for five and a half years before his death, and numerous cancerous tubercles lay in the skin around it.

From a man, aged 42 years, who was attacked with pain in the hand and elbow six months before admission to the Hospital, followed by ovoid swelling about the elbow. Death took place from pleurisy. Small masses of cancer were found in the lungs, liver, and kidneys.—See Abemethy Ward Book, vol. ii, p. *IA. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 49 ; and drawings, A. 23. 512. Sections of the upper part of a Femur. The medullary canal of the bone is filled by firm fibrous substance. Around this substance the walls of the bone are absorbed and converted into a loose flocculent texture. In the upper part of the specimen this change has extended completely through the bone : in the lower part it appears to be commencing upon the inside of the bone contiguous to the fibrous substance filling the medullary canal. The head and neck of the femur, and the os innominatum of the same side, had undergone similar altera- tions in structure. l- From a man aged 55. Microscopically the growth within the medullary canal consists, for the most part, ot well- formed fibrous tissue, forming alveoli containing epithelial-like cells—scirrhous cancer. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 50. TUMOURS OF BONES OF UNCERTAIN NATURE* 513. Section of a Humerus, with a Tumour which was attached to it. There is a portion of skin connected with the tumour and the surrounding muscles ; and the cicatrix in the skin is the result of an operation which was performed for the removal of a tumour which occupied the situation of that here shown. The disease beino- reproduced, it was deemed necessary to amputate the arm at the shoulder-joint. Both the arteries and veins are filled with red wax, which, having been injected into the brachial artery, returned freely by the veins. Part of the tumour is situated in the biceps muscle, the other part of it extends to the bone, on the outer surface of which there is an irregular cavity, in which a small portion of the tumour was imbedded. From this cavity several small canals deeply penetrate the bone, and the medulla in this part of the bone was softer and more vascular than elsewhere. On one of its surfaces the tumour has a very close connection with the vessels and nerves of the limb. The tumour is soft and of a medullary character. L 154 From a female aged 25 years. 514. An innominate Bone, the seat of a new-growth. The bone is infiltrated throuo-hout and the ilium is thickened by the projection of the tumour from its surfaces. On the outer aspect, a section throughout the growth has been made, which is turned forward.

The ventral aspect of the ilium is deeply eroded, and the boue is seen to be infiltrated and soft; towards the anterior part the same appearance is presented by the tumour growing out from its surface. From an aged person, whose liver contained many medullary tumours. 515. A Femur, of which the shaft has been in great part destroyed by ulceration, or by the pressure of a tumour. Around the ulcerated part the bone is rough and porous. Masses of bone, composed of fine osseous fibres, originally con- nected with the femur, have separated in maceration. Soft matter was mixed with these, and formed a large tumour around the femur, the remaining part of which is preserved in the next preparation. L 26 516. Section, including the outer surface, of the Tumour last referred to. It consists for the most part of dense fibrous tissue, in which are mingled some fine bony fibres. At its centre the substance was broken down and formed a large irregular cavity. ^7 There is a cast of the limb from which the two preceding specimens were taken—No. 13. * * ***** TUMOURS IN GREAT PART CALCIFIED OR OSSSIFIED—OSTEOID TUMOURS (probably Sarcomata). 517. A Femur, from the whole circumference of which a Tumour of a very large size has arisen. It extends from the condyles to near the upper end of the bone. The small portions of the femur remaining above and below the tumour are healthy. The tumour consists of bone, of a light texture and grey colour, in thin lamellae and very fine fibres, groups or masses of which, being arranged in nearly parallel lines, give the surface of the tumour a fibrous aspect. The tumour, probably, is an osteo-sarcoma, and was covered by some softer sub- stance. -*< a. 132 (In Case E.) 518. An Osteoid Tumour of the Tibia and Fibula, probably an ossifying sar- coma, i. 314 (In Case E.) 519. A longitudinal section of an Osteoid Tumour, involving the lower two- thirds of the left Femur. It was removed from a seaman, aged 45 }-ears, in whom it had existed for five years. During the last six months previous to amputation it had rapidly increased. When the integuments, which were healthy, were reflected from its surface, the muscles investing the tumour were found pale and softened, wasted and degenerated, and here and there in their substance small circumscribed portions of a firm growth appeared. It was difficult with the naked eye to define the limits of the growth; it seemed to pass gradually into the adjacent muscles. The surface of the tumour was of a pale buff colour, firm, and could be cut with a knife, but a few lines below this it passed into compact bone. The section displays the continuity of the tumour with the femur. The case is fully described in Mr. Lawrence's Lectures on Surgery, 1862. 520.

Its larger and outer part consists of medullary substance; the smaller and deeper, of a mixture of medullary substance and bone. The head of the femur is the only portion of the bone retaining its healthy structure. The morbid osseous substance is fragile, light, spongy, and cancellous; but the form of the cancellous spaces differs materially from that observed in healthy bone. L 170 from a girl aged 11 years. 522. Sections of the Femur last described. L 1*1 Presented by Joseph Sargent, Esq. 523. Section of the head and upper part of the shaft of a Tibia, and of an Osteoid Growth around and within it. A dense osseous substance, as hard as ivory, and dull white, like chalk or pumice-stone, occupies the place of the cancellous texture, and extends some way down the medullary canal. The tumour around the bone consists in part of a similar osseous substance, and in part of a soft substance, spongy and cellular in some situations, and medullary in others. A portion of the periosteum is separated, to show that the morbid growth has originated beneath the membrane from the surface of the bone itself. The smaller tumour connected with one side of the morbid mass occupied the situation of the popliteal lymphatic glands, and consists throughout of bone, partly ivory- like and partly spongy. L 1^ Microscopic examination showed the tumour to be an Osteo-sarcoma. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 40; and a drawing, A. 3. 524. The other half of the Tibia and Tumour last described, from which the soft matter has been removed by maceration. i. 140 525. Section of the Stump of the Femur from the same patient as the two preceding specimens. The extremity of the bone is covered by skin. Within the medullary cavity are distinct morbid deposits, consisting partly of osseous, and partly of soft, matter. 141 The patient was a middle-aged woman in whom the disease made slow progress for sixteen years, and gave little or no pain till three months before the amputation of the limb. She died eight weeks after the amputation with similar osteoid growths in the inguinal glands and lungs, and with wart-like tumours scattered over the diaphragm. 526. Sections of a Tibia, exhibiting a deposit of dense and very hard osseous substance, both upon the outer surface and within the medullary tissue of the upper two-thirds of its shaft. The original walls may be recognized on the surface of each section, but they are continuous with, the tumour. A circum- scribed space at the upper part of the shaft is covered by irregular plates of bone set vertically upon it. It is probable that on this space there was a softer portion of an osteoid tumour (osteo-sarcoma), which has been removed by maceration. L ^4 527. A Section of the upper end of a Fibula, and of a Tumour which is connected with it. The tumour consists of a mixture of bone and a softer fibrous-looking substance, and appears to have arisen from the periosteum. i. 60 528. Sections of a Fibula, upon the external surface of which are several Osteoid Tumours masses of compact wbite osseous substance, the outer surfaces of which have a fasciculated and finely fibrous aspect, like the surface of pumice- stono. Around these, the walls of the bone are in parts superficially ulcerated, and in parts thinly covered by new bone. The medullary canal is partially obliterated by a similar substance. I. 61 TUMOURS CONTAINING CYSTS. 529. Portion of a Femur, of which the lower extremity is expanded into a largeDISEASES OF BONES. 77 Cyst, which was filled bv liquid and coagulated blood and a small quantity of brain-like substance. The cyst is nearly globular; its walls are from a hue to two lines in thickness, composed of thin plates of bone and fibrous membrane smooth externally, and presenting internally at some parts a rough surface ot bone and at others numerous prominent decussating fibrous bands and cords, like the texture of the basis of a spleen or of erectile tissue. To these bands, as well as to the osseous surface, loose flocculi and small portions of bram-bke substance are adherent. Below, the cyst is bounded by the articular cartilages, the texture of which is unaltered; above, by the shaft of the femur which terminates abruptly just before it is expanded into the cyst. The shaft above the cyst presented numerous small spots of effused blood, like ecchymosis beneath the periosteum. L ^20 From a gentleman, 30 years of age, in whom the tumour had been two years in progress. Four years after the amputation of the limb he was in good health. 530. The Head of a Tibia with a large Osseous Tumour (probably an osteo- sarcoma) surrounding it. The tumour apparently originated from the external surface of the tibia and beneath the periosteum, which, in one situation, is seen continued from the tibia upon its external surface. In the centre of the tumour is a large irregular cavity which was filled by purulent fluid, and upon one part of its surface are some smaller cavities which were filled with blood, and the sides of which are formed by a dark coloured and soft substance. A part of the interior of the head of the tibia is occupied by a similar osseous substance. *■ 531. A large Cyst connected with the upper part of the Tibia. The disease seems to have commenced in the head of the tibia. The greater part of the wall of the bone is absorbed, so that the parietes of the cyst are formed above by the cartilage which covered the head of the bone, and in nearly all other directions by condensed fibro-cellular tissue, or the distended periosteum. A large portion of the cyst has been removed, to give a clear view of its interior, which is uneven, in parts fasciculated and coarsely reticulated, in other parts shreddy. It probably contained blood and had its origin (like the similar specimen, No. 529) in a medullary tumour growing within the head of the bone. i- 32 532. Portions of a Humerus and a Tumour connected with it, which appa- rently originated in the bone. The greater part of the shaft of the humerus has disappeared. The tumour connecting the remaining portions of the bone consists of soft pale substance of gelatinous aspect, in the centre of which is a large cavity, which contained a thick serous fluid. The brachial artery and nerves are attached to the exterior of the tumour, but they are healthy. i. 86 The tumour had a constant and regular pulsation, which ceased on compression of the sub- clavian artery, but the cause of which was not discovered in the examination of the limb. The patient was an old woman. 533. The Lower End of a Femur, with the contiguous soft parts occupied by a soft tumour containing a large cyst. Immediately above the condyles the bone has been almost completely absorbed, its continuity being preserved only by a small portion of the other part of the shaft. From a woman aged 36 years, in whom the disease had existed for ten months. 534. Section of a Tumour occupying the situation of the head and upper third of the shaft of the Tibia. The external surface of the tumour is covered in by the aponeurosis which invested the knee-joint, and by remains of the walls of the bone extended and thinned around it. At the upper part of the tumour78 DISEASES OF BONES. are the semilunar cartilages and the articular surface of the tibia in a sound state, but enlarged. Internally the tumour consists of a mixture of soft medullary substance and bone, disposed in the form of large cysts of various shapes and sizes, some of which were filled by a clear yellow fluid, others by coagulated blood. The walls of the cysts consist of membrane with bony fibres dispersed through it. Between the cysts are considerable spaces, filled by soft and shreddy medullary substance, which extends for a short distance into the interior of the shaft of the tibia, and then terminates with an abruptly ch'cumscribed line. ^5 Erom a woman 30 years old. The disease, beginning after a fall on the knee, had existed two years and a-half, and had gradually increased, without pain.

Sections of a Tumour with the side of the body of the Lower Jaw in which it originated ; removed by operation. Part of the mucous membrane of the mouth, unaltered in structure, is extended over the upper surface of the tumour. The disease originated in the cancellous texture of the jaw. The walls of the bone are expanded into a thin case enclosing the tumour, but, in consequence of the absorption of the bone in some situations, this case is incomplete. The morbid growth consists of granules of a peculiar fatty-looking substance, partitioned by fibro-cellular tissue, and having cysts dispersed through it which contained a glairy fluid. The boundaries of some of the cysts are thin plates of bone. L Microscopic examination of the tumour showed that it consisted of fibrous tissue embedded in which were cylinders and alveoli of elongated, narrow, almost spindle-shaped epithelial cells. The tumour may be regarded as essentially of the same nature as the following. See microscopic sections, No. 51. From a man aged 25. 536. A Cystic Tumour involving the left half of the Lower Jaw and extending slightly beyond the symphysis. The outer and lower surfaces are covered by a thin expanded plate of bone. On the upper and anterior edge of the growth the left incisors, canine, and first bicuspid teeth are crowded together. ^ Large cysts containing turbid brown serous fluid, which were ruptured during the operation, are seen on the upper and outer surface. Part of the inner surface is covered by the buccal mucous membrane, where an elougated ulcerated depression is seen, which was produced by the pressure of the upper teeth. The section shows an agglomeration of cysts of various sizes ; most of them are filled by a red granular material, which was found on microscopical examina- tion to be composed of blood-clot and colloid material; a few contain a cream- like o-lutinous fluid; others were filled by a turbid brown serous fluid. The cyst walls are formed of tough fibrous tissue, containing rarely a plate of bone, and are lined by a shining membrane. A portion of the right side of the symphysis is preserved, in which a cavity is seen—produced by expansion of the compact layers of the bone—filled with a soft, red, solid growth. I. 395 Microscopic Characters.—The solid portion of the tumour was composed of columns of cells and nuclei of the epithelial type, which, when cut transversely, presented the appearance of alveoli; similar small columns branched out from the sides of the larger. The cells in the centre of the columns had, in many places, undergone a colloid change, and by the complete metamorphosis of the cells the cysts were formed. From the buccal mucous membrane cover- ing the tumour, in certain parts club-shaped and branching cylinders extended down from the deep stratum 'of the epithelium, as in the ordinary formation of epithelial cancer. The microscopical examination of the tumour indicates that it is an epithelial cancer extending from the gum into the jaw, and undergoing colloid metamorphosis. It was removed from a lady, aged 45 years, and had been growing for ten years. The tumour did not cause any pain, and did not affect the general health. The submaxillary lymphatic glands were not enlarged. Ten years before the swelling of the jaw commenced,DISEASES OF BONES. 79 she had, for a long period, a discharge from the socket, of W ©it racted tooth, and was told by a surgeon that the jaw was necrosed. The tumour grew in this situation. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 52. 537. An Inferior Maxillary bone, the greater part of which is irregularly expanded to form imperfect septa between cysts. These, which_ originaled independently of one another in the interior of the bone, were lined with a highly vascular membrane, and contained thin, serous, or grumous, blood- tinged fluid. Of some the walls were thin; of some, thick and resisting, as in the case of the posterior mass, which, in its increase, pressed upon, and caused absorption of, the left ascending ramus and coronoid process. I. 308 This preparation was obtained from the body of a man aged 75. The disease had been five years in progress. The age of the patient prohibited its removal, but the various cysts were from time to time punctured and their contents evacuated.—See an account of the case by Mr. Coote. Lancet, October 10th, 1857. 538. Portion of Superior Maxilla containing a mass of Colloid Cancer, which filled the antrum and the spheno-maxillary fossa. It was removed from a patient aged 31, and had been growing three years. DENTIGEROUS CYSTS. 539. Poi'tion of a bony Cyst which was removed from the external and lateral part of a lower jaw. The cyst is lined by a thick and soft membrane which lias been in part separated from it. The cavity of the cyst was filled by a glairy fluid, and at the bottom of it a canine tooth of the second set was adherent to the lining membrane. Upon the exterior of the cyst are some branches of the facial nerve which were removed with it. At the bottom of t he bottle is the tooth which was contained in the cyst. I. 119 540. Part of a bony Cyst formed by expansion of the walls of the lower jaw of a sheep. The cyst was full of fluid, and an incisor tooth is loosely attached to its walls. i. 119a HYDATIDS IN BONE. 541. Half a Pelvis, exhibiting the effects of the growth of hydatids within the bones. The walls of the ilium are separated, and are in many places absorbed, so that there are large apertures in them, which open into a cavity extending through its whole interior. The same cavity communicates with that of the pelvis by a large opening in the acetabulum; and, by other openings, with a cavity in the interior of the sacrum, and with the spinal canal. There arc several apertures in the posterior part of the sacrum. All these cavities wore filled with hydatids, which had also protruded through the apertures in the walls of the bones, and were contained in cysts formed by the thickened periosteum and other tissues. I. 215 542. Part of the Acephalocyst Hydatids which were contained in the Bones just described. Some of them are entire, but the majority have been ruptured. i. 216 The patient was an elderly woman. There were other hydatids in a large cyst connected with the ovary. The disease was of long standing, and the patient died with suppuration of some of the cysts. ANGIOMA, INVOLVING BONE. 543. A Portion of the Skull-Cap of a child, which is very much thickened, and so soft in its texture as to be easily cut with a knife. It has throughout an appearance of great vascularity; and the soft parts covering It had the80 DISEASES OF BONES. (In Case O.) aspect of a naavus. This condition existed from the birth of the child, and extended over the left side of the head and face and the left arm and shoulder. L 54 Presented by William Kingdon, Esq. BONES VARIOUSLY ALTERED BY THE GROWTH OF TUMOURS. 544. Part of the Skull of a man about 40 years old, who had a large malignant tumour of the face. The tumour appears to have originated at the nasal process of the left superior maxillary bone and at the left nasal bone, upon which there is a projecting growth of processes and plates of bone. The tumour, extending from this centre, produced absorption of the inner and lower part of the left orbit, the inner and anterior part of the right orbit, the septum of the nose, the turbinated bones, and the middle and posterior parts of the palate. To a slight degree also it destroyed the left cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and the adjacent part of the upper wall of the orbit. At nearly all the parts of the bones upon which the tumour encroached, there is a thin everted border of bone. *• 225 545. Portion of the Cranium of a young person. A growth of short, vertically- placed, osseous fibres and lamella; has taken place on a large extent of both the external and internal surfaces of the cranium. They probably formed the basis of an ossifying tumour. The bone is completely perforated by many minute apertures. L *^ 546. Portion of the posterior and upper part of a Skull, with the subjacent Dura Mater. There is a large aperture formed by ulceration through the skull and the dura mater, both -above and below the tentorium cerebelli. The edges of the ulcer, both in the bone and in. the dura mater, are covered by granulations. 6. 57 From a woman 50 years old. The disease commenced with what was regarded as carcinoma of the scalp, which, having passed into the stage of ulceration, slowly spread through the skull and dura mater to the brain. 547. Frontal Bone, with the subjacent Dura Mater. Several soft medullary tumours have been formed on the external surface of the dura mater. Many of them are embedded in the skull; and one, of large size, having produced the complete absorption of the bone, has passed to the outside of the skull, where it is connected with a similar large mass between the bone and the pericranium. The bone itself is of very dense texture. 6. 58 548. A Skull-Cap, in which there are numerous oval, rough-edged apertures. Some extend through both tables; some are in the outer, others in the inner table alone. There has also been extensive destruction by ulceration of the frontal bone. The portions of bone between the apertures are healthy. a. 64 It is most probable that these changes were consequent on the growth of tumours. (In Case Gr.) 549. A Skull-Cap, in which are many large ulcerated holes, occasioned by tumours originating in the dura mater. As in the preceding specimen the edges of the holes are abrupt, rough, and sharp, and the loss of substance in the diploe is a little greater than in either of the tables. Ulceration has also in one situation commenced on the exterior of the frontal bone. The grooves for the meningeal arteries, which were doubtless enlarged for the supply of blood to the tumours, are very deep, though the skull is not thickened nor otherwise diseased, except in the parts involved by the tumours. a. 74DISEASES OF BONES. 81 550. Portion of a Skull-Cap, in which there has been extensive absorption. In the situation of the absorption of the inner table there were scrofulous tumours upon the dura mater. There were also sores in the scalp at the part where the outer table has been absorbed. A. 85 (In Case G.) 551. A Skull with the Lower Jaw. Many distinct portions of the cranium have been removed by ulceration like that consequent on the growth of tumours. In some situations, the absorption is confined to the diploe and outer table of the skull; in others, it extends through both tables. There has been disease in one of the articulations of the jaw, producing absorption of the articular cartilage, with a deposit of bone around the circumference of the glenoid cavity. The corresponding condyle is in part removed by absorption ; its surface is rough, except at one point, where it is highly polished, and has an ivory-like texture. In the ramus of the jaw on the same side, disease, apparently com- mencing in the cancellous tissue, has produced absorption of the bone at many separate and minute points. a. 87 (In Case G.) 552. A Skull-Cap, exhibiting ulceration of its outer and inner tables in numerous minute holes, of which many are distinct in close-set groups, but more have coalesced. There were fungous excrescences filling these minute excavations in the bones, some of which were attached to the pericranium, and others to the dura mater ; but it is uncertain whether they originated in the diploe or in the membranes investing the skull. A. 83 (In Case G.) 553. A Skull-Cap, with numerous minute round holes in both the outer and inner tables. Generally, the absorption of the outer corresponds with that of the inner table. An apparently similar specimen to the preceding, No. 552. A. 62 (In Case G.) 554. The Frontal, Parietal, and part of the Occipital Bones. The anterior surface of the frontal bone is to a considerable extent destroyed, leaving a large circular opening with irregular everted edges, portions of the outer table projecting in ridges around them. On the left side smaller perforations are visible, and the ridges become more conspicuous. Below, on this side, the walls of the frontal sinus are wanting, and the orbital plate, pushed downwards and forwards, is bounded anteriorly by a sharp and prominent ridge. On the right side the anterior wall of the frontal sinus has been destroyed, but the orbital plate is only slightly interfered with, and contrasts with the condition of the left. a. 160 From a man aged 26 years, who suffered for eight years from a tumour, slowly increasing, which was situated over the frontal hone, free from pulsation, and tolerant of pressure. It was partially removed by an operation. The patient sank rapidly under an attack of erysipelas accompanied by acute oedema of the larynx, for which tracheotomy was performed shortly before death. The openings, described above, were closed by the dura mater, except at the inferior border of the larger one, where the morbid growth (medullary cancer) perforated that membrane, and, forming a tumour the size and shape of a chestnut external to the visceral layer of the arachnoid, pressed upon the left anterior lobe of the brain. (In Case G.) 555. The Metacarpal Bone of a Little Finger. The bone is enlarged, apparently by an expansion of its walls; an osseous tumour growing from this bone had been removed some time previous to the amputation of the finger. r, 209 556. The upper part of a Femur, in which an oblique fracture, about an inch below the lesser trochanter, has united with angular deformity, the superiorDISEASES OF BONES. 82 (In Case G.) portion lying behind and across the inferior one. In the upper portion, m the place of the natural structure of the walls of the femur, there is only a fine net- work of bony plates and fibres, and the osseous tissue of the cancellous portion is formed of fine spongy and porous bone. The same change has taken place, in a less degree, in the lower portion. The diseased portions of bone, as well as the bond of union of the fracture, were filled, as if infiltrated, with tough, grey, cancerous matter. appendix o The patient was a woman 47 years old. Two years before death her breast was removed on account of hard cancer. Sixteen months afterwards, when the disease m the breast had returned and ulcerated, in stepping from a cabriolet, she fractured her femur. The fracture was united in six weeks, but she did not regain the use of the limb. She died eight months after the fracture, with extension of the cancerous disease of the breast. Presented by H. G-. Grayling, Esq. 557. Portion of a Tibia, exhibiting superficial and extensive ulceration of its upper half, with new bone about the borders of the ulceration. A fleshy tumour, originating in the soft parts, completely surrounded this part of the bone. A' 56 (In Case G-.) 558. A Tibia, in which there is a circumscribed oval ulcer which has destroyed the anterior half of its walls, laying open the medullary cavity. There is scarcely any appearance of reparation ; the edges of the ulcer are sharp and uneven, and the adjacent bone is light, but not otherwise unhealthy. I. 59 559. A Fibula and Tibia. The former rough and irregular from deposits of new bone upon its surface. The latter light and porous, compact tissue being absent except at the articular surfaces. It was infiltrated throughout with medullary cancer, which had caused in parts complete absorption of large masses of bone, and, iust below the head, had destroyed the whole thickness of the shaft. ' J a. 161 (In Case G.) 560. A Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration, extending probably from a malignant disease of the integuments, has penetrated the front wall of the tibia, destroyed its medullary tissue, and made small apertures in its posterior wall. A deposit of bone has taken place upon the fibula, and there is ossification of the inter- osseous ligament. A" (In Case G.) 561 Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration of the walls of the tibia has penetrated to its medullary cavity. The fibula is enlarged by heavy new bone and the interosseous ligament is extensively ossified. a. 55 (In Case G.) 562. A Tibia and Fibula. A large portion of the shaft of the tibia, in its entire thickness has been removed by malignant ulceration, like that m the last- described'specimen. The inferior portion of the tibia is united to the fibula by bone. The fibula is greatly thickened, and a fracture in the middle of its shaft has firmly united. A- '8 (In Case G.) 563 Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. A large portion of the shaft of each bone has been destroyed by ulceration, in consequence, probably, of some malignant disease; as in No. 549, the margins of the ulcer are abrupt, sharp,^and excavated.SERIES II. DISEASES OF JOINTS. DISEASE PROBABLY BEGINNING IN THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. 564. A Hip-Joint, from a young woman, in which, the articular cartilages of the femur and acetabulum have been removed by ulceration, and the exposed sur- faces of the bones are covered by soft granulations, and flakes of lymph. The capsular ligament is thickened, and the head of the femur and the acetabulum appear enlarged. At the anterior and inner part of the capsule, there is a large oval opening with smooth denned margins. This opening was immediately beneath the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles, in the situation at which the bursa naturally existing beneath that tendon sometimes communicates with the cavity of the hip-joint. IL 58 A large psoas abscess had long existed in this patient: and it seemed probable, that the pus having passed under the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles, and through the aperture of communication between the bursa and the joint, had excited acute inflammation of the latter. 565. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. The cartilage has been completely separated both from the head of the femur and from the acetabulum, and some shreds and ulcerated remnants of it are loose in the cavity of the joint. The ligamentum teres is destroyed. The exposed bones are superficially but smoothly ulcerated. The cavity of the acetabulum is en- larged by the ulceration of its walls. The capsule is thickened, and its synovial Burface appears swollen, soft, and thinly covered by lymph. II. 14 The patient was a sailor, 40 years old. He awoke one night with intense pain in the hip, which lasted some hours, and then in a less degree continued, till, in a fall, he bruised his hip. After this the pain again became exceedingly severe; and continued, without remission, till he died. 566. A Knee-Joint, showing the earlier stage of disease, commencing in the synovial membrane. The joint was filled with pus and broken down lymph. The synovial membrane is thickened, pulpy, and vascular. The pouch formed by the reflection of the synovial membrane in front of the thigh is enlarged, and the membrane is here lined by flakes and bands of inflammatory material. A vascular fringe of pulpy synovial membrane surrounds and encroaches upon the articular cartilages. The surface of the cartilages is irregular from absorp- tion, as if chiselled, but at no part is the bone exposed. The cartilage covering the left condyle of the femur is removed to show the vessels springing up into it, from the bone beneath. A section has been made through the patella. The bone is vascular; at one point the inner surface of the cartilage is eroded by granulations springing up into it from the bone (sub-chondral caries). The ligaments were almost destroyed. Microscopic examination of the cartilage showed that its cells were proliferating. From a boy aged 13. He stated that his knee had been bad for six months. It was ex- tremely swollen, hot, and painful. The tibia was displaced backwards and outwards.—See Colston Ward Book, vol. t, p. 429. G 2DISEASES OF JOINTS. 84 567. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. An abundant deposit of lymph has taken place upon the internal surface of the synovial membrane, and thin flakes of it adhere to the articular cartilages. ir. 3 Vide No. 612. "PULPY DEGENEBATION" OF THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. ("White Swelling-.") 568. An Elbow-Joint, in which, probably by chronic inflammation, the synovial membrane is converted into a light-brown substance, of a firm texture, about half or three-quarters of an inch in thickness, with white lines running through it in various directions, and with a soft smooth surface. The morbid change terminates at the margins of the articular cartilages. Around the neck of the radius, the thickened synovial membrane forms a fold projecting into the cavity of the joint. The cartilages and bones of the joint appear healthy. n. 12 The patient was a man 60 years old, and the disease had existed fifteen months. It origi- nated in a blow, after which the joint remained very stiff, but without pain and with little swelling, for twelve months. Numerous small swellings, like enlarged lymphatic glands, then formed around the joint ; they inflamed, and when punctured discharged a glairy fluid. The disease outside the joint increasing, the limb was amputated. On examination the swellings were found to have no connection with the interior of the joint. The difficulty of motion in the joint, especially the hindrance to the rotation of the radius, appeared to depend on the projecting folds of the synovial membrane. 569. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting a peculiar change of structure in the synovial membrane. The capsule has been extensively opened and raised for the purpose of exposing the cavity of the joint. The internal surface of the synovial mem- brane is granulated. The membrane has everywhere become very thick, and especially so at the upper and front part of the joint, where its thickness is not less than two inches, and its substance is so firm as to be almost of a gristly texture. The part of the membrane opposed to the articular cartilage of the femur was adherent to it. The whole of the soft parts external to the diseased synovial membrane have been carefully removed, so that nothing else is left around the joint. n. 24 Vide No. 633. DISEASE PROBABLY BEGINNING IN THE ARTICULAR ENDS OP ( THE BONES. 570. The Hip-Joint of a child, in which the ligamentum teres, the cartilage of the acetabulum, and a part of the substance uniting the three component bones of the os innominatum, have been destroyed by ulceration. A portion of glass is passed through the floor of the acetabulum into the pelvis, where a collection of pus was formed beneath the obturator muscle and fascia. The acetabulum and the capsular ligament, a part of which is preserved, are lined by lymph, which was mingled with pus ; but, with the exception of a slight superficial ulceration of its articular cartilage, the head of the femur is healthy. n. 59 The child, 7 years old, had suffered for six months with pain, and obscure signs of disease, in or about the hip-joint, when she was seized suddenly with the most acute pain in the joint, which after some time remitted but returned at intervals. Two months afterwards she died. Presented by R. W. Tamplin, Esq. 571. A Hip-Joint, of which the synovial membrane and the ligaments are swollen and intensely congested. The surfaces of the joint are smeared with shreds of recent lymph. The cartilage investing the femur is thinned by superficial ulceration; that investing the upper margin of the acetabulum is undermined, and detached from the bone. On the dorsum ilii just above the margin of the acetabulum, is an abscess cavity, which contained about a teaspoonful of cheesyDISEASES OF JOINTS. 85 pus. This cavity communicates by a narrow track, through which a bristle is passed, wit h the acetabular cavity where the cartilage is detached. A similar track also passes through the ilium at the level of the upper margin of the acetabulum, into an abscess cavity within the pelvis. FromaeJuld aged 7 years, who died in the hospital from purpura hemorrhagica. The disease of the hip had been in progress in a chronic form for two years, but had become much more acute just before her admission a fortnight previous to her death. A section through the head and neck of the femur shows that the cancellous tissue is healthy. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 36. 572. Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. Parts of the free surface of the cartilage upon each bone have been absorbed. There has also been a more extensive absorption of the deep or attached surface of the cartilage, so that its connection with the bone was loosened, and it was readily separable from it. Where the absorption of the deep surface of the cartilage had taken place, the surface of the bone was covered by granulations. it. 31 In the recent state the bones were seen to be exceedingly vascular ; and it was presumed that inflammation of their articular surfaces preceded the other changes in the joint. 573. Bones of the Knee and Ankle-Joints of a boy, in which ulceration, con- nected with acute necrosis of the tibia, extended through both the upper and lower ai-ticular surfaces of the bone. The articular cartilages of the femur and patella are in places destroyed, and their attachment to the bone is loosened. The cartilage of the upper surface of the astragalus is almost wholly removed, and the exposed bone is covered with lymph. II. 46 From the same patient as No. 33 in the preceding Series. 574. Sections of the Bones of a Knee-Joint. Within the outer section of the head of the tibia, and occupying the position of the intermediary cartilage and epiphysis, a cavity containing pieces of necrosed bone imbedded in gelatinous granulation tissue is seen. The articular cartilage of the tibia is destroyed, and that of the femur is deeply absorbed. The trochlear surface of the femur is tuberculated from absorption of the cartilage around masses of bone imbedded in it. The synovial membrane was pulpy, and the joint filled with pus. The disease of the joint was evidently due to inflammation, extending from the articular end of the tibia. Kemoved by amputation from a boy aged 2f. The knee is reported to have been quite sound until a fortnight before his admission to the hospital: it then presented the appearances of long standing disease. There was no history of injury. The disease in the bone was not suspected before remova lof the limb.—See an account of the case in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xv, p. 131. 575. The lower extremity of a Femur, a slice having been sawn off its external condyle. ^ On the portion thus separated, close to the point of attachment of the anterior crucial ligament, there is a deep cavity lined by a smooth membrane. By its side is suspended a small, oval-shaped portion of bone, which, with its surface bare and rough, was loosely contained in the cavity. The synovial mem- brane was thick and pulpy, mid pus occupied the interior of the joint. n. 68 From a boy who had received several severe blows upon the knee, the inflammation which ensued being at first neglected. Suppuration was eventually established in the joint, and an abscess formed between the periosteum and the shaft of the femur. His health failing, it became necessary to amputate the limb. He recovered from the operation without an unfavour- able symptom. 576. A Knee-Joint. A section of the head of the tibia shows a small portion of dead bone in the centre of its cancellous texture. A piece of glass is passed through a fistulous passage extending from the skin covering the front part ofDISEASES OF JOINTS. 86 the head of the tibia to the dead bone in its centre. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint is very vascular and its internal surface is covered by a layer of lymph, into which the injection has freely passed from the vessels of the synovial membrane. l- 123 From a young -woman, on whom amputation of the limb was performed on account of inflammation in the knee-joint consequent on necrosis in the head of the tibia. The necrosis had existed many years. 577. The inner section of an Ankle-Joint. The articular surfaces of the tibia and astragalus are extensively destroyed and covered by granulations. There is a cavity in the lower end of the tibia, which is filled up by soft fibrous tissue. The bone above it is condensed, and the astragalus, 'immediately beneath the eroded surface is similarly hardened. Numerous fistulous tracks, through which glass rods have been passed, lead from the joint through the integuments. The synovial membrane is pulpy. The other bones of the tarsus are soft but not carious, and the joints are healthy. From a woman, aged 58, whose ankle became swollen and painful without evident cause two years before her admission to the hospital. Amputation through the leg was performed.—See Stanley Ward Book, vol. vii. 578. The other section of the Tibia preserved in the preceding specimen after maceration. There is a large cavity in the articular end and internal malleolus, the walls of which present two large perforations ; the cavity was filled in the recent state by gelatinous tissue. A narrow canal extending from the upper part of the cavity along the centre of the shaft is cut across; its continuation passes obliquely through the bone and opens on the inner surface. Some distance above this a small cavity is seen which does not communicate with it. The lower end of the bone is rough and thickened by the formation of new bone on the surface. 579. The lower end of a Tibia, removed from a girl aged 17. A cavity in the cancellous tissue just above the articular extremity is filled by a deposit of caseous material. The ankle-joint was destroyed. Disease had existed in the leg and foot for fourteen years. *• 319 Vide also Nos. 67 and 68. SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING THE CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURES OF JOINTS OR IN THE ARTICULAR ENDS OF BONES, THE EFFECTS OR CAUSE OF JOINT DISEASE. DESTRUCTION OF LIGAMENTS. 580. The Hip-Joints from the same person. In each the ligamentum teres is wanting, but a portion of its acetabular attachment is seen in one specimen. The capsules appear perfectly normal. The depressions for the attachment of the round ligaments are deeper than usual, and the cartilage forming the upper maro-in is soft and filamentous ; immediately above this point the cartilage of each0femur is ulcerated, superficially in one and more deeply in the other. On the under surface of the head of each femur, and near the margin of the arti- cular surface, there is a similar symmetrical erosion of the cartilage. A section tlirouo-h the head of one femur shows that the bone is healthy, except imme- diately beneath this ulceration, where it is much softened. The cartilage of the acetabulum preserved is so thin in places as to show the bone through it, and, at the upper margin, a plaque of cartilage of considerable size is detached. rr ii. 43 581 The Bones of two Hip-Joints from the same person. In each joint are exhibited exactly the same morbid changes. Nothing remains of either lio-amontum teres, except a few shreds of fibrous tissue attached to the head ofDISEASES OF JOINTS. 87 each femur. Close by the insertion of this ligament a each of the articular cartilages has been removed by ulceration, and on the anterior £rf£rf the neck o°f each femur there is « synovial and fibrous covering, beneath which the surface of the bone is hard and nodulated. SEPARATION AND LOOSENING OF THE CARTILAGE FROM THE BONE 582. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of acute inflammation affecting chiefly the articular cartilages. The synovial membrane is slightly tokenedjnd increased in vascularity. Upon the patella, as well as upon the outer condyle of the femur and the head of the tibia, the free surface of the articular cartilage is extensively absorbed. There has also been some absorption of its deep or attached surface, so that its connection with the bone is loosened. The exposed surface of the bones is very vascular. The mtient was a boy aged 15 years. The disease had been of only two months' duration ; it^^T^S^ h the cellular tissue of the ham, and tWe extended mto the joint. During the last fortnight of its progress the pain was extremely severe. The limb u a, amputated, and the patient recovered. 583. Section of a Femur, exhibiting the effects of inflammation of the cancellous texture and articular surface of one of its condyles. The increased vascularity of the bone is shown by the degree in which its vessels have received injection. The connection of the articular cartilage with the bone was loosened so that it II O / was readily separated. 584. The articular portions of a Femur and a Patella, exhibiting partial absorp- tion of the articular cartilages, and loosening of their connection with the bones. The cartilage upon the patella has been absorbed m its centre, and was readily separated from the bone, except at its border, where it main- tained its natural firmness of connection. Upon the posterior part ot the condyles of the femur, the whole thickness of the cartilage is absorbed; the exposed surface of the bone is rough and very vascular. n. 32 585. Sections of the condyles of a Femur. The articular cartilage is thinned, and its connection with the bone is so loosened that its separation was readily effected. Portions of the cartilage have been detached and turned downwards, to show that parts of the surface which were connected with the bone are unnaturally rough. The exposed surface of bone is very superficially ulcerated and thinly covered by granulations. n- 0 586. Portions of Cartilage which necrosed, and were separated from the condyles of a Femur, after amputation through the knee-joint had been per- formed. The patient, a boy 14 years old, fractured his fibula, and there followed severe diffused inflammation of the leg, rendering its removal necessary. The skin flaps retracted so as in a few days to expose the condyles, wh^n the piece of cartilage, along with smaller fragments, loosened and were removed. ULCERATION OF ARTICULAR CARTILAGE. 587. A Patella, from which nearly all the articular cartilage has been removed by ulceration. The ulceration appears to have extended from the free surface towards the bone ; the margins of the remaining peripheral part of the cartilage are either abrupt and smooth, as if cut with a curved chisel, or, in parts, thinly prolonged over the surface of the bone. All the cartilage that remains has retained its natural firm connection with the bone. . The part of the surface of the patella which is exposed by the ulceration of the cartilage is itself superficially ulcerated and covered with lymph. n. 9DISEASES OF JOINTS. 88 588. Section of an Ankle-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. The articular cartilages are completely destroyed, and the bones are superdcially nlcerated and vascular. The other bones and the joints of the tarsas are healthy. n. 1 589. An Astragalus, from the superior articular surface of which nearly all the articular cartilage has been removed; a small portion remains closely acherent to the bone, and very thin. The exposed surface of bone is healthy, except at one small portion, which is superficially ulcerated. II. 2 590. An Ankle-Joint, from whicli nearly all the articular cartilages have been removed : the small portions which remain are thinned, and their connection with the bone is loosened. The bones are superficially ulcerated and very vascular. The posterior surface, by which the astragalus articulated with the os calcis, is similarly diseased. n. 4 591. A similar specimen of ulceration of the cartilages and bones of an Ankle- Joint; but here the exposed bones are covered thickly with lymph. n. 5 592. The extremities of a Tibia and Fibula, and the Astragalus. The corre- sponding articular surfaces of the ankle-joint show nodular overgrowths of the cartilage, associated with absorption and ulceration.

From Rheumatic Disease, vide No. 666 et seq. FIBROUS DEGENERATION OF CARTILAGE. 594. A Patella, in which there is softening, with fibrous degeneration and absorption, of the articular cartilage. The disease affects only half the cartilage. At the borders of the diseased part there are cracks extending in various directions through the whole thickness of the cartilage, and some of its substance between the cracks is converted into close-set tufts of fine filaments, which float out from the surface of the bone, and are about twice as long as the healthy cartilage is thick. In the centre of the diseased spot, where the morbid change has made most progress, the cartilage has been wholly removed, and the exposed surface of the patella is hard and nodulated. n. 51 595. The Bones and Ligaments of a Knee-Joint. The anterior crucial ligament is wanting, and small portions of the articular cartilages of the femur and tibia have been absorbed, apparently after fibrous degeneration. The opposite joint was similarly and symmetrically diseased. II. 53 ULCERATION (Caries) OF THE ARTICULAR SURFACES OF BONES. 596. Bones of the Elbow-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation which, probably, commenced in the joint. The texture of the bones is porous and spongy : their articular surfaces are ulcerated, and, upon the external surface of each bone, there is an irregular deposit of new bone in ridges and . sharp processes. n. 30 597. Bones of the Wrist, exhibiting the effects of inflammation in the whole of the carpal and metacarpal joints. The articular surfaces of the several bones are extensively ulcerated,—some superficially, others deeply,—and there is a very abundant formation of new bone around the ulcerated parts. n. 23 598. Portions of an Os Innominatum and a Sacrum, exhibiting the effects of inflammation in the sacro-iliac symphysis and the posterior part of the ilium.DISEASES OF JOINTS. 89 The surface of the diseased Lone is ulcerated, and around it are irregular deposits of new bone. A large circular hole is seen in the ilium, the result of necrosis of a portion of its texture. B. 54 (In Case G.) 599. A Hip-Joint, in which the articular cartilage covering the acetabulum and head of the bone is completely destroyed. The exposed surfaces of bone are ulcerated, and the acetabulum is thereby enlarged. The ligamentum teres is also in great part destroyed, but shreds of it remain, and retain their connection with the bones. The capsule is thickened, and its inner surface is thinly lined by lymph. n. 19 600. A Hip-Joint from a child. Both the acetabulum and the whole of the head and neck of the femur have been destroyed by ulceration. The femur is still attached to the os innominatum by the obturator externus muscle. II. 18 601. Bones of the Hip-Joint, from a boy 18 years old, in whom disease of the hip had existed for twelve years before death. Part of the head and neck of the femur has been removed by ulceration. There has been also ulceration of the wall of the acetabulum, widening its cavity, and at one point penetrating into the pelvis. New bone has been formed in the bottom of the acetabulum, and was intimately united with the rough ulcerated surface of the femur. II. 48 The disease of the hip was not in progress when the patient died with phthisis. 602. Portion of a Femur, of which nearly the whole head has been destroyed by ulceration. The uneven rough surface of what remains is covered by shreds of false membrane, by which, probably, it was fixed in the acetabulum. n. 15 603. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been superficial ulceration of the head of the femur, and ulceration of the acetabulum penetrating to the cavity of the pelvis. B. 38 (In Case Gr.) 604. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been extensive ulceration of the acetabulum, and of the head, neck, and parts of the trochanters of the femur. There is necrosis of the tuberosity of the ischium and of a portion of the great trochanter : both the dead pieces of bone are surrounded by grooves of separation. An ulcerated passage extends from the acetabulum through the ischium, just above its spine ; new bone has been formed upon the shaft of the femur and other parts adjacent to the seats of the necrosis and ulceration. B. 10 (In Case Gr.) 605. An Os Innominatum, in which ulceration has removed the whole surface of the acetabulum, and has formed a large aperture of communication between its cavity and the interior of the pelvis. B iy (In Case Gr.) 606. An Os Innominatum and Femur, from a boy, exhibiting the effects of disease of the hip-joint. The walls of the acetabulum are in great part destroyed by ulceration, and its cavity communicates by three apertures with that of the pelvis. The head of the femur is also completely destroyed. All the bones are atrophied, and the ilium is placed almost vertically, and deeply incurved. (In Case G.) B* 46 607. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head and neck of the femur. Osseous deposit has taken place around the neck of the femur, and in thick nodules upon the posteriorDISEASES OF JOINTS. 90 and inferior margins of the acetabulum. The remains of the head of the femur were adapted to the surface of new bone formed on the acetabulum; and the summit of a very large mass of new bone growing up from the upper part of the neck rested on the surface of the new bone formed behind the posterior margin of the acetabulum. B- ^ (In Case G.) 608. The bones of the Hip-Joint of a young person. The brim of the acetabulum, and the head, neck, and part of the shaft of the femur, have been completely removed by ulceration. There are also large ulcerated apertures in the upper and anterior walls of the acetabulum. B- (In Case Gr.) 609. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been superficial ulceration of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur. The head of the femur was slightly displaced upwards. b. 15 (In Case G.) 610. Bones of a Hip-Joint. The neck of the femur is not more than half an inch long. The head is expanded and flattened into the form of a disk ; its margin is very irregular; its articular surface is soft, and perforated by numerous small holes. The acetabulum is wide and shallow, in correspondence with the form of the head of the femur, which exactly fitted it. The notch of the acetabulum is very large, and much of the osseous tissue adjacent to it seems to have been destroyed. B- 51 (In Case Gr.) 611.

Bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of inflammation, which it was presumed commenced in the synovial membrane. The greater part of the articular surfaces of the tibia and femur are deeply ulcerated; the portions of them which remain are hardened and polished like ivory. Upon the exterior of each bone, contiguous to its articular surface, there is an irregular deposit of osseous substance. 613. Sections of the head and upper part of a Tibia. Portions of the bone, from long-continued inflammation, are irregularly excavated by ulceration, and the whole of its texture is porous and spongy. lo^> The limb was amputated in consequence of destructive inflammation of the knee-joint. 614 The Lower Extremity of a Femur from a case of destructive disease of the knee-joint.

A Hip-Joint, from an adult, exhibiting the effects of inflammation. The cartilage covering the head of the femur is completely destroyed by ulceration, and the exposed surface of bone is covered by lymph. The ligamentum teres, also, is destroyed. The head of the femur is dislocated from the acetabulum, and is drawn upwards and backwards upon the dorsum of the ilium, where it rests surrounded by a capsule formed, probably, in part by the diseased old capsule, and in part by the surrounding tissues thickened and consolidated. ii. 17 626. The Hip-Joint of a young subject. Displacement of the femur has followed absorption of the margin of the acetabulum, and its head lies upon the ischium,92 DISEASES OF JOINTS. close to the notch and a little above the tuberosity, in contact with the great sciatic nerve, under which bristles are passed. Immediately below the head of the bone is the obturator extern us muscle. The articular cartilage of the femur has been completely absorbed, and the surface of the bone is ulcerated and covered by lymph and granulations. No remains of the capsule are apparent. The shaft of the femur is fractured at the junction of the epiphysis of the great trochanter with the shaft. The periosteum is inflamed and sepa- rated from the bone some inches below the fracture, which occurred during life. The disease of the hip-joint was of long standing. n. 44 627. A Hip-Joint, in which acute disease had been several months in progress ; from a boy 10 years old. The head of the femur is displaced towards the dorsum of the ilium. Ulceration of the capsule had taken place, and the head of the bone was contained in a cavity formed by the remains of the capsule, and by the surrounding muscles. Within this cavity, as well as in the aceta- bulum, was a mixture of a large quantity of pus and caseous matter. The section of the head of the femur shows caseous matter deposited in its can- cellous texture. There is also a collection of caseous matter in the walls of the acetabulum communicating with its cavity and with the cavity of the pelvis. An abscess had formed between the periosteum and the shaft of the bone just below the trochanter. The sciatic nerve is seen upon the tuberosity of the ischium, near the dislocated head of the bone. n. 49 628. The head of the right Femur and the Acetabulum of a girl, aged 19. The femur was dislocated from disease of four years' duration, and there is a depression for the head of the bone above the acetabulum. The hip-joint was quite destroyed, and a large abscess in the front of the thigh communicated with the pelvis through an ulcerated aperture in the acetabulum. (In Case G.) 629. A Knee-Joint, in which anchylosis has been effected by the organization of lymph upon and between the opposite surfaces of the synovial membrane. A portion of the adherent synovial membrane is reflected from the front of the joint. The patella is firmly united to the external condyle of the femur ; and the tibia and fibula have been drawn backwards under the femur, lengthening and giving a very oblique direction to the external lateral ligament. The bones are atrophied. n. 7 630. A Knee-Joint, in which, in the course of inflammation of long standing, the Tibia and Fibula have been dislocated backwards, so that the head of the tibia is fixed to the posterior surface of the condyles of the femur. The patella is fixed by osseous anchylosis to the outer condyle. Both the lateral ligaments and the ligamentum patellae are much elongated, but their tissue appears healthy. n. 57 631. A Knee-Joint in which, during the course of long-continued inflammation, the Tibia has been dislocated backwards and outwards. Firm anchylosis by fibrous tissue has taken place between the inner half of the upper surface of the tibia and the condyles of the femur. The patella is anchylosed to the outer surface and lower margin of the outer condyle of the femur. The external and internal lateral ligaments, retaining their normal attachments, are much elongated. n. 55 632. A Knee-Joint, from a young subject, amputated on account of disease of the synovial membrane. The articular cartilages and bones are unaltered. The lateral ligaments are apparently unaltered in structure, but are considerably elongated, and have permitted displacement of the articular surfaces. n. 40D1SKASKS OK JOINTS. 93 633. Portion of the Synovial Membrane, with the Patella, from the Knee-Joint last described.

The bones of a Shoulder-Joint, in which the glenoid cavity and head of the humerus have been entirely removed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have smoothly healed; but, probably, there was no motion at the joint. B. 31 (In Case G.) 635. A Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur have been com- pletely absorbed. The margins of the acetabulum, also, have been absorbed, and its cavity has been filled up : so that in its place there is only an oval, flat, rough surface, with which the corresponding surface of the femur remaining between the trochanters was in contact. The two surfaces were exactly adapted to each other, and covered by a substance like cartilage, so as to form a sort of joint, around which a thick capsule extended. n. 21 These changes may be regarded as the results of healing after destructive ulceration. 636. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been ulceration of the aceta- bulum and of the head and part of the neck of the femur. The ulcerated surfaces appear to have healed, and were closely adapted. The femur is adducted and extremely flexed. b. 8 (In Case Or.) Presented by Richard Partridge, Esq. 637. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head and neck of the femur and the brim of the acetabulum have been destroyed by ulceration. The ulcerated surfaces have healed. The femur was not displaced: the remains of its neck appear to have rested in the acetabulum, and the trochanter minor in the foramen ovale. The bones are very slender, but their tissue appears healthy. b. 3 (In Case Or.) 638. Pelvis and Femora, from a young man. The head of the femur and the acetabulum on the left side exhibit changes consequent on long-continued disease of the hip-joint. The acetabulum is wider and shallower than is natural: and the head of the femur, deeply ulcerated, has wholly lost its natural form. The ulcerated surfaces had healed, and the bones were united by a soft tissue which permitted a slight degree of motion between them. The left os innominatum and femur, atrophied and ill-developed, probably in consequence of their disuse are considerably thinner and smaller in all their dimensions than the bones'of the opposite side ; and the left side of the pelvis is contracted by the nearly vertical position of the ilium.

The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur, after extensive ulceration, had been displaced upwards and backwards by the absorption of the margin of the acetabulum, and was then fixed by bony anchylosis. The acetabulum is tilled by bone, which has coalesced with a large growth of new bone from the lower surface of the neck of the femur. The ilium is thickened by ex- pansion of its walls, chiefly on its ventral aspect. The femur is in a position of flexion and extreme adduction. b. 1 (In Case G.) 653. The bones of a Hip-Joint, in which the head of the femur, after superficial ulceration, has been displaced on the posterior border of the acetabulum, and is there firmly united by bone. New bone has also been formed on all the adja- cent parts of the os innominatum. The acetabulum was deeply ulcerated. B. 4 (In Case G.) 654. The bones of a, Hip-Joint, exhibiting an osseous anchylosis of the head of the femur to the ilium, similar to that shown in the preceding specimen. A thin band of bone, half an inch wide, extends between the trochanter major and the upper part of the tuberosity of the ischium. B. 6 (In Case G.) 655. The left Knee-Joint of a woman, aged 27, in which disease had existed for seven years subsequent to an injury. The tibia and fibula have been slightly displaced outwards and backwards. The patella is rough from deposit of new bone, and is firmly united to the outer condyle of the femur. The tibia is united by bone to the femur. The natural structures of the joint have entirely disappeared. Here and there soft material existed between the ends of the bones similar to ordinary granulations. B. 59 (In Case G.) 656. Section of the bones of a Knee-Joint, exhibiting osseous anchylosis of their articular surfaces, with displacement of the tibia. B. 41 The other half of the joint is preserved in No. 639. (In Case G.) 657. The Bones of a Leg with the lower end of the Femur. The head of the tibia is fixed by firm osseous anchylosis to the articular surfaces of the femur and fibula. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are curved outwards. The wall of the tibia is irregularly thickened, and on the anterior and upper part, near the knee-joint, there is a rough and porous elevated surface of new bone. 'Over this surface there had long been an ulcer extending down to the bone. b. 49 (In Case G.) 658. The bones of a Knee-Joint, in which the inner condyle of the femur was united by bone to the inner border of the articular surface of the tibia.

There is complete osseous anchv- losis between the tibia and fibula and the astragalus. From a woman aged 23, who had suffered for seven years from strumous disease of the ankle ami tarsus. The disease had never been either acute or very extensive, but it, was suffi! cient to have prevented her walking on the limb. Amputation through the lower third of theDISEASES OF JOINTS. 9(5 leg was performed at the patient's earnest request, after she had been for some months in the Hospital, during which period very little appreciable improvement had taken place. 660. A section through the Tibia, Os Calcis, Scaphoid, and the remains of the Astragalus, taken from a boy, aged'11 years. Osseous anchylosis has taken place between these bones. A carious tunnel, about one inch deep, extends along the outer side of the astragalus. Four years before his death the greater part of the astragalus and upper part of the os calcis were removed by the gouge for caries. 661. A portion of the lower part of a Tibia, divided in an anterio-posterior direc- tion. At the margin of the articular surface the cartilage has been partly absorbed and the cancellous tissue is exposed. In the centre there is a thin scale of bone firmly adherent to it. EL 83 From a boy aged 14, who, after a neglected fracture of the fibula, suffei*ed extensive necrosis of the bones, and inflammation of the ankle-joint. He became so reduced by suppuration and surgical fever that amputation through the knee was performed five weeks after the original injury, and one month after the ankle-joint became involved. On examination the bones were found inflamed and very vascular. Anchylosis had already so far advanced that in parting the astragalus and tibia the thin scale that is seen on the surface of the tibia came off from the articular aspect of the astragalus. The case is related in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. iv, 1845. 662. The Tibia, Fibula, and Astragalus of a man, divided longitudinally, showing osseous anchylosis, the result of inflammation following an injury four years previously. The bones are rarefied, but the tibia above is thickened. A portion of necrosed bone lies loose in the medullary cavity at the lower extremity of the tibia. (In Case Gr.) 663. The inner side of a Right Foot, showing a longitudinal section at the level of the division between the second and third toes. There is complete bony anchylosis of the ankle-joint and of the articulation between the astragalus and os calcis. The tibia, astragalus, and posterior part of the os calcis are condensed by inflam- mation, but otherwise appear healthy. The anterior portion of the os calcis is carious. The astragalo-scaphoid joint is normal. All the other tarsal and tarso- metatarsal joints are more or less affected ; the synovial membrane is pulpy. The tarsal bones are soft and fatty, and were deeply congested. From a man aged 33. The anchylosis was the result of an injury sustained sixteen years before the foot was amputated in the lower third of the leg for strumous inflammation of the anterior tarsal bones.—See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. v, p.

A Scapula, showing' the effects of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The glenoid cavity is entirely destroyed, and in its place there is a rough semilunar surface of bone, upon which the humerus moved: the upper horn is bifid, and formed by the acromial and coracoid processes ; the lower by a process of bone about one and a-half inches long, projecting from the inferior margin of the scapula. The extremity of the acromial process is separated from its base. i. 850 Eemoved from the body of a man who was brought to the hospital for dissection. No history of the case could be obtained. The opposite shoulder and both hip-joints were also affected in a similar manner, but to a much less degree. (I ii Case G.) 668. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting partial absorption of the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity, with flattening and a great increase of the width of their articular surfaces. The surfaces of the scapula and humerus, which were brought into contact by the absorption, are exactly adapted to each other, and are covered by a substance like cartilage, so as to form a new joint. It is pro- bable that these changes were the result of rheumatoid arthritis. in. 1 669. The bones of both the Shoulder-Joints of an adult. In each joint there has been ulceration, or such absorption as occurs in chronic rheumatism, of the articular surfaces of the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity. The heads of the humeri are flattened and enlarged by growths of bone around their borders; and the glenoid cavities, enlarged in a corresponding degree, and deepened, extend backwards and inwards to the bases of the spines of the scapulae. The articular surfaces thus enlarged are mutually adapted, and are hardened, perforated, and in some parts polished and ivory-like. The changes of structure are symmetrical, except in that the articular surfaces of the ri^ht shoulder-joint are more extensively polished than those of the left. b 32 (In Case G.) 670. A Scapula and the upper part of a Humerus diseased in the same manner as No. 706. The borders of the acromion are thickened and beset by nodules of new bone. A small portion of its inferior surface, indurated and polished was adapted to a similar surface on the upper part of the head and the great tuberosity of the humerus. Around the head of the humerus and on its tuberosities there are deposits of bone similar to those on the borders of the acromion. ^ (In Case G.) B" 671f" £ H?,merus'. T^VH RadiuS and Ulna- In sequence of chronic disease of the elbow-joint, the fore arm appears to have been for a long time nearly fixed m a position of extreme flexion, with the hand in extreme pronation The articular surface of the humerus is much deformed ; the internal condvle is reduced m size and pointed ; the trochlear cavity is nearly obliterated ; the greater part of the articular cartilage was removed ; the external condyle has a part of its surface hardened and polished; and nodules of new bone have been deposited around the borders of the articular surface. The outei division of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna is hard, polished, and superficially grooved: the inner division is soft and rough as if it had been deeply ukerated The lesser sigmoid cavi y is obliterated; and just below its position thSis a large and deep pit m which the tubercle of the radius rests.

There has been ulceration of the sur- faces by which they articulated. The ulcerated surfaces, hardened and polished, have become remarkably grooved and adapted to each other, so that the new joint which they form may have permitted a very free movement ot the radius upon the ulna. The surface by which the ulna articulated with the overhanging border of the radius is similarly polished: the carpal surface ot the radius is healthy. (In Case Or.) 674 A Hip-Joint. In consequence of Rheumatoid Arthritis the acetabulum is oreatlv enlarged and has assumed an oval form. The head of the femur is enlarged and adapted in its form to the acetabulum. All the articular cartilage is removed, and the surfaces of the bones are smooth, hard, and polished. Ine capsule of the joint is thickened, aud upon its internal surface around the neck of the femur there are several groups of slender pendulous growths. II. 675 A Hip-Joint, in which there are portions of hard cartilaginous and osseous substance They are fixed to the inner surface of the capsule, and to the anterior part of the neck of the femur, by adhesions of tough fibrous tissue; their contiguous surfaces are exactly fitted to one another, and they form a nodulated, oval mass, nearly three inches long, one surface of which rested upon and was adapted to the neck of the femur. The capsule is thickened and its interior is beset with slender pedunculated processes. n. 5b From a woman upwards of 70 years old. The mass formed a distinct tumour projecting m the groin. 676 Sections of the head, neck, and part of the shaft of a Femur. The neck of' the bone is considerably shortened, and there is irregular osseous deposit upon its external surface. IIL It is uncertain whether these changes were consequent on injury. The external appearance of the bone might indicate tbat there had been a fracture of the neck ; but the uniform character of its tissue, as shown on the surface of the sections, is opposed to such a conclusion. 677 A section of the upper part of a Femur, from a man who had for four years suffered with rheumatic pains in and about the hip. A large portion of the articular cartilage has been completely removed from the middle of the head of the femur. The bone thus exposed is unnaturally hard ; its surface is polished and the morbid hardness extends for about a line in depth. Of the remainino- cartilage, some is softened, thick, succulent, and nodulated on its surface while that round the margin of the exposed bone is very thm; other Darts ao-ain, are marked with grooves, like wrinkles, radiating to the outer mar£rin°of the head; and others are converted into a fibrous tissue, which hanes in shreds from the surface of the bone. New bone, in hard irregular nodu'les, is formed around the margin of the head, and on the neck of^ the femur. From the patient from whom the specimens of medullary disease of the ilium, in the preced- ing Series, Nos. 501 to 501 were taken.99 DISEASES OF JOINTS. 678. The bones of a Hip-Joint. The depth of the acetabulum is increased by absorption of its base, and by ossifioation of the cotyloid ligament. The articular surface of the femur is in part removed by absorption ; and there is a rough, nodulated formation of new bone around the margin of the head and on the neck of the femur. The surfaces of the acetabulum and head of the femur on which absorption has taken place, are rough, hard, and deeply and irregularly perforated, like worm-eaten wood: parts of the remains of their articular surfaces are hardened and polished. B. 7 (In Case G.) 679. The upper portion of the Left Femur and the Acetabulum from a male subject brought to the dissecting rooms. The shape of the articulating surfaces is much altered ; they are flattened, and there is abundant osseous deposit about the head of the femur, and, to a less extent, about the margin of the acetabulum; the result probably of rheumatic disease. B. 61 (In Case G.) 680. Sections of the bones of a Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the upper part of the head of the femur. The surface of the part thus absorbed, as well as that of the acetabulum with which it was in contact, and on which it probably moved freely, are polished, ivory-like, and perforated like those in specimen No. 683. B> 12 (In Case Gr.) 681. The bones of the Hip-Joints of a man aged 71, exhibiting nearly symmetrical changes of structure; the effects of chronic rheumatism. There is an irregular and very abundant deposit of osseous substance around the margins of the acetabula and upon the borders of the heads and necks of the femora. Both the width and the depth of the acetabula are thus greatly increased; their articular surfaces, as well as those of the femora, are hard and rough, and a portion of the head of one femur with the corresponding surface of the aceta- bulum is polished and ivory-like.

Portion of a Femur, the head of which is deformed by the flattening of its upper half and the enlargement of its border: the neck, also, is shortened. b. 40 This and the two preceding specimens closely resemble each other ; it is probable that these changes were dne to rheumatism. (In Case O.) 690. A left Knee-Joint, showing the early changes of Chronic Eheumatic Arthritis. The cartilages are fibrous and in places soft and filamentous; the articular surfaces are uneven and fissured, and at the margins there is an overgrowth of cartilage producing an irregular overhanging edge with nodulated outgrowths. These changes are most marked on the femur, especially on its trochlear surface. The synovial membrane is thickened and fibrous ; there were numerous adhesions between it and the margins of the articular surfaces. Passing between the inter-condyloid notch of the femur and the spine of the tibia are numerous broad bands of adhesion, which oppose an effectual resistance to complete flexion. The patella is much thickened, especially at its lower and outer part, where it reaches the thickness of an inch and a-half. The lower end of the femur also appears thickened. The specimen was taken from a man aged 35 years, who died of chronic peritonitis, following ulcer of the stomach. None of the other articulations were affected.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 202. 691. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting numerous growths on its internal surface. The growths are of various sizes, nodulated, grouped, and attached, for the most part, by narrow pedicles. They are most abundant about the margins of the articular surfaces of the bones. Some of them are cartilaginous, others osseous ; and there are some which consist of fibrous tissue covered by a thin membrane, like a reflection of the synovial membrane. The heads of the bones are enlarged, their articular cartilages are removed, and the exposed surfaces are hard and polished. ll- 28 The disease had existed for more than two years with signs of chronic inflammation of the synovial membrane. There were four ounces of fluid "like train oil" in the cavity of the joint. The patient recovered completely after the amputation of the limb. Presented by Thomas Fereday, Esq. 692. Portion of a Knee-Joint, with various growths from the internal surface of its synovial membrane. Most of these growths consist of fringes of slender101 DISEASES OF JOINTS. and leaf-like processes of a soft fibrous structure : others are firmer and approach to cartilage m their character ; and one is a flattened, nodulated growth of bone covered by a thin membrane. The other structures of the joint appear healthy. U. 34 693. The articular surfaces of a Knee-Joint, showing the changes consequent on Chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis. The synovial membrane, when opened, was of a deep port wine colour. The parts were removed'in resection of the joint from a man, aged 35 years, who had suffered from pain in the knee for three years ; the joint had been swollen for eighteen months. He died from pyremia. A portion of the spine affected with rheumatoid arthritis is preserved in Series V, No. 1085.—See Rahere Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 126. 694. The lower Articular Extremity of a Femur. There is a small patch of fibrous degeneration with erosion of the cartilage covering the internal condyle, and commencing nodular outgrowths spring from the margin of the cartilage of both condyles. The synovial membrane was normal. A portion of the spine was considerably affected with rheumatic disease, and the metatarsophalangeal mints slightly. The patella is preserved in Series VI, No. 1216. 695. Sections of the lower extremity of a Femur. A quantity of cancellous bone lias been formed on the articular aspect of the cartilage. ' The latter, though absent at certain parts, retains, in its chief extent, its natural appearance and position. The new bone seems to have originated in a growth external to the old, to the surface of which, and to the articular cartilage, it has become inseparably connected. The specimen was taken from a subject in the dissecting-room. The joint presented the appearances of rheumatoid arthritis. Presented by T. Smith, Esq. 696. The Bones forming a Knee-Joint. Their surfaces are irregular, and rough, from an abundant formation of compact, new bone. Other portions of bone were scattered amidst the thickened tissues, which surrounded the articulation, and which had amalgamated into a coarse fibrous structure. The changes had been preceded by chronic rheumatic arthritis. ° B 53 (In Case Qc.) 697. The Bones of .the Shoulder, and of both Knee-Joints of an old woman who was brought to the dissecting rooms. Their articular surfaces present the ordinary appearances of chronic rheumatoid arthritis ; and besides the femora are marked by ridges and grooves which run in a longitudinal direction and correspond with similar ones on the wider surface of the patella. Several of the joints were affected by the disease, but none were grooved in this manner. (In Case G-.) 698. Bones of two Knee-Joints from the same person. There has been rheumatic disease m each joint, occasioning a deposit of new bone around the articular surfaces of both the femur and the patella. The patella*, displaced outwards have been adapted to the outer condyles; and their articular cartilages having been completely removed the opposite surfaces of the bones have been absorbed in regular and mutually adapted grooves, and are hardened, polished, and ivory.

The capsule is thickened : in its upper part is an irregular opening, and the tendon of the supra-spinatus is here seen to have been separated from the tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of the biceps is attached to the upper part of the bicipital groove ; the intra-capsular portion appears to have been worn through, for a portion of it, in shreds, remains attached to the edge of the glenoid cavity. Numerous villous tufts and dendritic filaments project from the inner suface of the capsule, and the articular cartilage of the humerus is thinned, stained, and fibrous-looking in the centre. in. 59 703. The other Shoulder-Joint of the person from whom the preceding specimen was taken. The capsule is thickened. The tendon of the biceps, separated from the glenoid cavity, has become firmly adherent to the bicipital groove, and an irregular nodulated deposit of bone has taken place around the part to which it is now attached. A slight overgrowth, as a continuation of the deposit, has taken place at the margin of the articular cartilage, which appears fibrous, and hasl ost its polish. A few clumps of dendritic filaments are seen springing from thei nner surface of the capsule. nI- 60 The changes described in this and the preceding specimens are apparently due to rheumatoid arthritis. 704. The Upper Extremity of a Humerus. The tendon of the biceps is attached to the bicipital groove, and lesser tuberosity of the humerus. A low nodular overgrowth has taken place at the margin of the articular surface, probably as the result of rheumatoid arthritis. v- 10 705. A similar Specimen. An overgrowth described in the preceding is here more marked, and in addition there is a circular patch of dry caries in the centre of the articular surface. V. 11 These are probably the specimens referred to by Mr. Stanley in a paper on " Enpture of the tendon of the biceps," Medical Gazette, vol. iii. 706. A Humerus and a Scapula.

The great tuberosity of the humerus presents a convex surface, which appears to have been adapted to, and to have moved upon, the concavity on the under part of the acromion. b. 44 It is probable that these changes followed the destruction of the tendon of the biceps muscle, either by disease or by accidental rupture.103 DISEASES OF JOINTS.

(In Case G.) CHANGES IN JOINTS DUE TO GOUT. 707 and 707a. The hands of an old woman who was brought to the hospital for dissection. The fingers are bulbous and extremely short, and a section shows that tlie soft tissues are laden with urate of soda. Many of the large joints of the body were affected with chronic rheumatic arthritis. No history of the case before death could be obtained. DEPOSIT OF URATE OF SODA ON THE CARTILAGES. 708. The articular portions of two Femora and two Patella} from the same individual. A deposit of urate of soda, the effect of gout, has taken place upon the surface of their articular cartilages. n- 33 709. An Os Calcis and an Astragalus (probably from a gouty person), the articular surfaces of which are uniformly covered by a thin deposit of white earthy matter, consisting principally of urate of soda. The cartilages themselves are thin. 10 710. A Patella, the cartilage of which is whitened by a similar deposit. The bone appeal's also thickened and nodular. H- H The two preceding specimens were taken from a man between 40 and 50 years old. Nearly all the joints in the body were in a similar condition ; in some, a portion of the white substance was in a fluid state, and around some there was a similar condition in the adjacent tissues. 711. The Distal Phalanges of a Great Toe, with an extensive deposit of urate of soda in and around the joint. A large calculus in Series LII was taken from the same patient. LOOSE BODIES IN JOINTS. ATTACHED TO THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. 712. Portion of an Elbow-Joint, in which there are several cartilaginous growths from the internal surface of the capsule, immediately above the olecranon. Two of these are closely attached to the capsule. A third is attached to it by a round and thin pedicle, apparently formed by the synovial membrane. One portion of cartilaginous substance, which was found loose in the joint, is at the bottom of the bottle. II. 39 713. A Loose Cartilage, removed by the subcutaneous operation, from the Knee- Joint of a young man. The cartilage is of a flattened discoid shape; attached to it are the remains of the pedicle by which it was connected to the bone. 714. A Loose Cartilage, removed from the Knee-Joint. This body was not con- tained loose in the cavity of the joint, but was attached, and was removed only after its base had been divided. 715. A disc-shaped mass of Cartilaginous Substance, with a nodulated border, which was removed from the interior of the knee-joint of a young man. It is suspended by a portion of cellular tissue, by which it had probably been at one time attached to the synovial membrane. xxxv. 37DISEASES OF JOINTS. 104 716.

A Loose Cartilage, removed from the Right Knee-Joint of a boy, aged 15 years. Symptoms of its presence had existed for five years. 718. A flattened oval mass of Cartilage, smooth on one surface, nodulated on the other, which was removed from a Knee-Joint, in which it was loose. The central part of the mass appears to be osseous. IL 25 719. A similar, but rather smaller Specimen, in which there are also specks of osseous substance in the centre. n. 26 720. A Loose Cartilage, which was extracted, through an incision made over it, from the left Knee-Joint of a young man, aged 17, in whom it had existed,— occasioning the usual symptoms,— for nearly two years. No bad effect followed the operation. DETACHED PORTIONS OF THE ARTICULAR SURFACES. 721. Two portions of Cartilage, removed from the Knee-Joints of a lad, 18 years old. They are almost exactly alike in form and size, each resembling such a piece of cartilage as might be obtained by removing that which covers the posterior surface of one of the condyles of a femur; and each, as such a piece would be, is smooth and polished on its convex, and rough on its concave, surface. xxxv. 55 There was an interval of about a year between the operations by which these bodies were rernoyed from the joints. The patient recovered from both the operations without a bad symptom. Presented by Luther Holden, Esq. 722. A Loose Cartilage, removed by the subcutaneous method, from a Knee- Joint. It consists of a layer of cartilage and a layer of bone intimately connected with each other. The cartilage is smoath and glistening on its free surface, like ordinary articular cartilage ; in profile it is seen to have the thickness of the layer that encrusts the condyles of the femur in a healthy adult. Its margins are irregular and cancellous. Examined with a microscope, the cartilage was found to be precisely like articular cartilage. In its deeper layer the cells lie with their long axis at right angles to the subjacent bone, while towards the free surface they are small, flattened, and with their long axis parallel with the surface. The bone presents the characters of true osseous tissue. The patient, a bargeman, aged 27, had suffered severely with the ordinary symptoms of loose cartilage in the joint. He was not aware of having injured his limb. He recovered without a bad symptom after the operation.—See St. Bartholomew Hospital Reports, vol. iv, p. 256. MASSES SEPARATED FROM THE ARTICULAR MARGIN IN RHEUMA- TOID ARTHRITIS. 723. Numerous irregularly nodulated masses of partially ossified fibrous Cartilage from a Hip-Joint. EXCISION OP JOINTS. 724. The upper part of a Humerus excised for the remedy of disease in it and in the shoulder-joint. The whole of the articular surface of the bone is ulcerated.105 DISEASES OF JOINTS. The ulceration is nearly all superficial and uniform, but near the attachment of the capsule are two more deeply ulcerated parts. Beyond the attachment of the capsule, the surfaces of the tubercles and of the shaft, which for half an inch below them was removed in the operation, are covered with a thin layer of new bone. The whole texture of the bone is light and fatty, but in other respects appears healthy. II- 60 725. The Elbow of a girl, aged 20. The Joint was excised for strumous disease ten months previous to the removal of the limb. The operation was performed in a provincial hospital and extreme care seems to have been taken of the limb after its performance. The girl came to the hospital seven months afterwards. The arm was useless, the fore-arm falling when not supported. The fingers were stiff and their motions all but lost. The thumb could be moved with tolerable precision. The sensation of the inner part of the limb was impaired, and the entire limb was colder than its fellow. It was also manifestly smaller, and was just an inch shorter. The parts around the joint seemed sound; the cicatrix was soundly healed, and the limb could be moved in any direction without pain, or any evidence of roughened bone within. After three months' perfect rest on a splint, with great attention to the general health without improvement, the limb was removed. The muscles around the joint were firm, of good colour, and not evidently smaller than in health. The biceps and brachialis anticus were natural, and at their insertion had contracted new adhesions. The triceps was adherent to the lowest remaining portion of the humerus, especially on the outer side, and its tendon could be traced on to the ulna. This muscle, unlike its antagonists, was pale and wasted, with much fat between its fasciculi. The extremities of the bones were surrounded by a tough, firm capsule, most marked anteriorly. The capsule was much strength- ened by a thick fibrous cord extending from the internal condyloid ridge to the coronoid process of the ulna, and the flexor muscles had in part their origin from it. The ulnar nerve could be traced to the internal condyle but no farther, the nerve there blending with tough, matted, fibrous tissue. An inch beyond this point there was an appearance, but not a satisfactory one, of a continuation of the nerve. The capsule, when opened in front and turned back, was found composed of dense fibrous tissue attached to the margins of the divided bones Its surface, in places, was smooth and glistening. There was no fluid of any kind within. The cut surface of the humerus-was covered everywhere with fibrous bands passing into the capsule. This was more apparent behind than in front, The cut surface of the radius was covered with some thin delicate fibres running into the capsule at the margins of the bone. These when re- moved showed the cancellous tissue imperfectly walled in. The surface of the ulna, however, was merely covered with a thin smooth layer, and except at the margins, had no attachment to the capsule. Here the extremity of the bone had been covered with a continuous layer of new bone. There were no bands of fibres which could be traced running from the humerus to the bones of the fore-arm. 726. The excised articular portions of the bones of an Elbow-Joint. Their articular surfaces are all ulcerated, and, in the humerus, the ulceration has extended deeply destroying considerable portions of both its condyles, and of the trochlea between them The ulcerated surfaces are hard, and, in parts smooth as if the ulceration had not been progressive at the time of the excision' bonV 8 mcluded in the j°int are thi% covered with new ii. 61 The patient was a girl about 20 years old The rWn<s« nf ffcn i, a i > was attended with suppuration through fistubus pa Jies Mid P I loUS existcd> an* good use and mobility of the elbow. passages. After the excision she recoveredDISEASES OF JOINTS. 10(5 727. An Olecranon Process excised from a diseased Elbow-Joint. Its articular surface is ulcerated, like those of the bones last described, and, at its centre, it is completely penetrated by a large oval ulcerated passage. n. 62 In this case, the other bones of the elbow-joint appeared but little diseased, and it was judged unnecessary to excise them. The wound of the operation slowly healed, and the patient, a young man about 20 years of age, regained a moderately good use of the joint. 728. The Wrist of a man, aged 28, from which, eight years previously, the greater number of the carpal bones were removed on account of strumous disease of the joint. The hand retained very considerable power of flexion and extension. With the exception of the trapezium, pisiform, unciform, and part of the cuneiform bones, the carpal bones have been removed. These and the metacarpal bones have become adapted to the articular surfaces of the radius and ulna, and united to them by dense fibrous tissue, admitting of some motion at this part. This bond of union has been divided. The remaining bones appear healthy. 729. The head and the fragments of the neck of a Femur, excised in a case of disease of the hip-joint. The articular cartilage is removed by ulceration, and granu- lations and shreds of soft lymph cover the ulcerated surface of the head of the femur. The texture of the bone is soft, and in the recent state was deeply ruddy. The cancellous spaces are in many parts filled with inflammatory products. The patient, a boy 12 years old, had suffered long and severely with suppurative disease of the hip-joint, and was exceedingly reduced by profuse discharge from abscesses round it. The removal of the head of the bone was followed by marked recovery of strength and general health, and by closure of most of the abscesses and sinuses about the joint. The articular surface of the acetabulum was in the same state as that of the head of the femur. 730. Sections of the head and neck of a Femur excised from a diseased hip- joint. The articular cartilage is almost entirely removed by ulceration ; but that of the epiphysis appears healthy. The head of the femur is superficially, and in one portion more deeply ulcerated; its remaining substance is yellow, hard, and solidified. The substance of the neck is very soft; it could be com- pressed with the finger, and its cancellous tissue is filled with inflammatory products. 731. The great Trochanter, with a portion of the shaft, and the remains of the neck of a Femur, excised from a girl with disease of the hip. The head and about one-third of the neck of the femur were destroyed by ulceration. The remains of the neck, the whole substance of the trochanter, and of the _ re- moved portion of the shaft, are extremely'atrophied, soft, light, and thinly walled. IL 63 732. A Knee-Joint, upon which the operation of Excision had been performed. The tibia is displaced considerably backwards. The bones are loosely united together by fibrous tissue, but no osseous union has taken place. 733. A Knee-Joint, on which the operation of Excision had been performed a considerable time before death. The tibia is displaced backwards and out- wards from the femur. A considerable formation of new bone has taken place by which the femur and tibia are firmly united. The patient had been able to walk well with the limb. 734. Section of the bones of a Knee-Joint, seven years and a half after excision. The bones are firmly united by osseous union, but the tibia is in a position of slight flexion, and inclined outwards. From a boy, aged 11 years. Amputation through the thigh was performed on account of the malposition of the tibia.107 DISEASES OP JOINTS. 735. A Knee-Joint after an unsuccessful Excision. The tibia is drawn backwards behind fche femur and is placed nearly at a right angle with it. Absorption has taken place where the bones are in contact; their tissue is healthy, but there is no osseous union between them. From a boy, aged 5 years. Amputation of the thigh was performed five months after the excision.—See Sitwell Ward Book, toI. ii, p. 101. 736. The bones forming a right Knee-Joint, upon which a partial Resection was performed for disease of one year and a half's duration. The ends of the bones are covered by gelatinous granulations, and loosely connected by soft fibrous tissue, but there is no bony union. The tibia is at a right angle with the femur. A cavity, containing a sequestrum of cancellous bone as large as a hazel nut, occupies the lower extremity of the diaphysis of the femur. It communicates by a narrow sinus, which is cut across, with the space between the two bones. The wall of the femur around the cavity is thickened and sclerosed. A portion of the internal condyle only remains of the epiphysis of the femur ; that of the tibia is preserved. From a child, aged 4 years, whose thigh was amputated in the hospital thirteen months after the resection, which was performed in the country.—See Stanley Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 311. 737. A Section of the bones of a Knee on which Excision had been performed. The femur and the tibia, where they lie in contact, are firmly united by bone. A large sequestrum lies loose in a cavity in the upper end of the tibia. The patient, a lad 14 years old, and of feeble health, underwent excision of the knee-joint, which was affeoted with strumous disease of long duration. Many months after the operation the knee remained large, the skin covering it was inflamed and unhealthy, and many siuuses discharged foetid pus. Several operations for the removal of carious and necrosed portions of bone were performed from time to time. The large opening seen at the outer side of the joint was made during one of these operations, and through it the sequestrum which lies at its bottom was found, and partly gouged away. At length, as the wounds did not heal, and as the boy's general health was much reduced, amputation above the knee was performed. 738. Section of the Bones of a Knee-Joint, of which the opposite half is shown in the preceding specimen. 739. Parts removed in an operation for Excision of the Knee-Joint. In flexing the leg whilst opening the articulation, the epiphysis of the femur snapped across : the line of separation is seen in the preparation. The specimen also shows the relation of the articular surfaces modified by the backward displace- ment of the tibia. The patient, a boy aged 9 years, made a favourable recovery. FOREIGN BODIES IN JOINTS. 740. The head of a Fibula with some of the surrounding tissues. Below, firmly embedded in fat and cellular tissue, is part of a needle, about half an inch in length. The structures around are natural in appearance, and free from thick- ening or induration. III. 12G The needle had been driven, nine years before, into the front of the joint, when the patient was abovit five years old. For four years it seemed to produce no disturbance ; from that t ime onwards there was almost constantly progressive suppurating disease of the knee-joint. The patient died, after amputation, from pyaemia.INJUBIES OF BONES (Fractures). VARIETIES OP FRACTURE.* FISSURED. 741. Specimen of Fissured Fracture of the Skull. The right parietal bone is tra- versed by two converging fissures united by one that runs transversely. A Assure also extends upwards through the left parietal bone. There is no depression of the fragments. At the base of the skull two fissures extended from either side of the foramen magnum into the corresponding temporal fossaa, that on the rio-ht side being most extensive. These fissures did not unite with those seen on the vertex, and were probably produced by sudden impulsion of the weight of the body upon the occipital condyles through the cervical spine, when the vertex struck the ground.

The displaced portion of the parietal pressing downwards, and acting like a wedge, has caused separation of the sutures in the immediate vicinity. The fracture occurred three weeks before death, and scanty new bone may be seen deposited about the edges of the displaced portions, chiefly on the cerebral surface. (In Case H.) ^V^I^teA Comminuted Extracapsular Fracture of the neck of the Femur, which has firmly united. The neck of the femur is driven into the great trochanter, and has detached a large portion of it with the trochanter minor. The rotation outwards of the shaft of the femur is well shown. * Other Specimens illustrating the Varieties of Fracture will be found among fractures of particular bones, p. 127. »<0 *ti A>" INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). , 10J The specimen was taken from a woman, aged 73 years, who was admitted to Lawrence Ward, having been thrown violently on to her hip, in getting out of a railway carriage. There was no crepitus, but about one inch shortening. The patient died seven weeks after the accident from bronchitis. 746. An Extensively Comminuted Fracture of the upper third of the femiir. The fracture passes obliquely through the junction of the upper with the lower two-thirds of the shaft. A large mass of bone, which includes the outer surface of the great trochanter, the lesser trochanter, and part of the outer surface of the shaft, is separated by the fracture. The top of the great trochanter is also broken off. 747. Portion of a Femur, fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends in several directions through the lower third of the shaft a little above the condyles, and downwards between the condyles into the knee-joint. Several small portions of bone were completely detached. C 13 (In Case H.) 748. Portions of a Tibia and a Fibula.

The fractured portion, about four inches in length, comprises in its whole extent about one-half of the thickness of the ulna. in. 85 It is remarkable that the bone was splintered to so great an extent longitudinally without the fracture passing at any part through the entire thickness of the shaft. The vacancy left in the bone by the removal of this fragment was filled by granulations; but whether these granulations ossified could not be satisfactorily ascertained. 750.

A vertical fracture extends through the base of the neck, which is driven into the upper part of the shaft. The small trochanter is also broken off from the body of the bone. The injury was caused by a fall five weeks before death. The only symptoms of fracture were inability to raise the limb, and pain on pressure. in. 135 752. Portion of a Femur, showing an impacted extra-capsular fracture of the neck of the bone. The plane of one fracture extends through the base of the neck; that of the other vertically through the trochanters, so as to separate the pos- terior parts of these processes and of the bone between them.

The Lower End of the Femur and the Knee-Joint, from a woman aged 30. The specimen shows a compound comminuted fracture of the lower end of the femur. The sharp extremity of the broken bone had perforated the integuments a short distance above the patella. The limb was amputated about six weeks after the injury, on account of destructive inflammation of the knee-joint. See Lawrence Ward Book, vol. i, p. 372. 756. A Knee-Joint, exhibiting the consequences of a fracture in the lower part of the Femur. The fracture extended transversely through the shaft a little above the condyles, and downwards between the condyles into the joint. The upper portion of the bone was forced downwards by the side of the patella, and a few days after the fracture, it protruded through the integuments, and could not be again replaced. In this situation it has become firmly fixed by bone to the condyles and the lower part of the shaft. An inch and a half of the protruding portion of the femur perished, and its separation from the living bone had commenced by the formation of a shallow groove between them. The articular surfaces of the knee-joint are anchylosed. III. 34 757. A Knee-Joint from a young subject, with an Oblique Fracture of the Femur just above the condyles. The upper portion of the femur, crossing the lower portion obliquely, has been united by bone to the back part of the outer condyle. About two inches of the extremity of the upper portion of the femur which protruded through the skin were sawn off during life. Inflam- mation extending to the knee-joint has produced absorption of the articular cartilages and adhesion of the opposite parts of the joint.

The larger portion, comprising the head, neck, and upper half of the shaft of the left femur, exhibits the effects of two fractures which were produced at different times by very slight force. The first fracture, which occurred about two inches below the lesser trochanter, is firmly united, but in such a manner that the two portions form an angle of about 75°. The second fracture happened a few days before death; it passes transversely, but very irregularly, through the shaft of the bone. The smaller portion, consisting of a section of the right femur, exhibits the union of a fracture precisely like that which first occurred in the left thigh. The rest of this bone is preserved in the Series I, No. 6. The texture of the bones is soft, light, spongy, and infiltrated with fatty matter. C. 116 (In Case H.) 760. Section of a Femur from a young woman, in which a fracture was pro- duced by the action of the surrounding muscles.

GUNSHOT AND OTHER SIMILAR INJURIES. 761. A Skull-Cap with the Dura Mater, showing the apertures of ingress and egress of a bullet which passed through it transversely. The aperture of ingress, just above the right angular process of the frontal bone, is small and round ; that of egress, below the left parietal eminence, is as large as a shilling and the edge is broken away externally. The history is unknown. 762. A Skull. Through the squamous portion of the right temporal bone, at its junction with the parietal, a bullet has passed.

A right Innominate Bone; on the outer side of the ilium is a large circular aperture, and around it are many indentations, in some of which the shots pro- ducing them are seen impacted in the osseous tissue. c. 119 (In Case H.) From a boy 17 years of age, who died sixteen days after having been accidentally shot by a companion. He progressed favourably for a time, but, on the twelfth day, he was seized with rigors, and suffered from a great increase of pain about the region of the wound. He sank rapidly. A probe introduced along the track of the shot detected bone denuded of periosteum ; it being suspected that pus had formed on the pelvic aspect of the ilium, the surface of that bone was exposed, and the opening, conspicuous in the preparation, was made with the tre- phine. No benefit resulted to the patient, and the haemorrhage which ensued from the iliac fossa was with great difficulty restrained. After death the hip-joint was found full of pus, its synovial membrane highly congested, and its cartilage natural. There was extensive suppuration throughout the right pyriformis muscle, and puriform fluid in the internal iliac vein. 765.

Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the tenth day after a transverse fracture through the middle of the shaft. A ring-shaped mass of cartilaginous substance is deposited between the periosteum and bone, around and for some way above and below the line of the fracture. In the centre of this cartilage there are some minute deposits of earthy matter. The line of fracture is distinct: in the medullary cavity it is interrupted by a deposit of cartilaginous substance; but in the walls of the bone it is still open. in. 69 770.

Section of the Tibia of a Dog, which was fractured a fortnight before death. New osseous substauce is thinly deposited in a ring beneath the periosteum,. around, and for some way above and below the line of fracture ; but in the line of the fracture, as well as in that part of the new bone which immediately surrounds the line, the osseous union is not completed ; a line of cartilage only is here seen on the surface of the section, just as in the two preceding specimens, and No. 772. in. 96 772. Section of the Tibia of a Dog, exhibiting the process of union on the eighteenth day after a similar fracture. The cartilaginous substance deposited between the periosteum and bone around, above,' and below the fracture, is ossified, except in that part which corresponds with the line of fracture. This line is still open (as in the preceding specimen) in the wall of the bone, but is closed by cartilaginous substance in the medullary tube. in, 71 773. Radius and Ulna of a Dog. A portion of the middle of the shaft of the radius, in its entire thickness and with its periosteum, was removed ten weeks before the dog was killed. In the upper part of the bottle is the piece of bone which was thus removed. The vacant space was found filled by soft connective tissue. The shaft of the ulna opposite to, and corresponding with the vacancy in the radius, is considerably enlarged by the deposit of osseous substance beneath the periosteum. m. 86 774.

The fracture extends obliquely from behind forwards, and from above down- wards, through about the middle of the shaft. The sharp extremity of the lower fragment projects slightly, but elsewhere the bones are in close apposition. Both fragments,, to a distance of between one and two inches from the line of fracture, are ensheathed in a layer of new bone (provisional callus) At the line of fracture, the new bone, filling the angles between the fragments is a third of an inch in thickness; from this point, in each direction it gradually decreases in thickness till it is lost sight of, and the bone bordering on it only appears more than naturally vascular. The new bone is very finely cancellous; it is inseparably connected with the surface of the old bone and on its outer surface, which is rough and porous, is closely invested by the periosteum beneath which it was formed. The periosteum itself is thickened. The frag-' ments thus ensheathed and held together almost immoveably by the new bone" are not directly united; the line of fracture is still evident between them • but some new bone has been formed in the medullary cavity of each. m' 124 The child was two years and ten months old.

There is a moderate amount of provisional callus around the fracture, over which the periosteum may be seen to be continuous: callus has also formed be- tween the fragments, but the medullary canal is not yet re-established. There is no deformity : the limb was shortened half an inch. The usual treatment by a long splint and subsequently gum and chalk bandage was adopted. 785. Sections of a Clavicle, exhibiting a fracture which occurred while the patient was holding a weight above his head. Considerable progress has been made m the repair of the fracture, the ends of the bone being held firmly together by an osseous ring extending around them. The periosteum is in part separated, to show that this osseous ring is deposited wholly beneath the membrane. Callus is also in process of formation between the fractured surfaces. The general texture of the clavicle does not appear diseased. Itl. 92 From a man aged 60. He stated that he had suffered rheumatic pains in the clavicle for some time before the fracture occurred: but he was not aware of the existence of the ti ncture ; and when, about two months afterwards, he came under the care of a surgeon, the ring of bone around the clavicle received so distinct a pulsation from the subclavian artery, that the swelling was suspected to be an aneurism. The patient died of erysipelas of the head three months after the fracture of the clavicle. 786. Sections of the upper part of a Femur, in which a fracture partially united extends obliquely through the base of its neck, in a line marked by bristles. The synovial and periosteal coverings of the neck of the bone are entire, and there is, in consequence, no separation of the fractured surfaces. in. 32 The patient was a man 60 years old. He was knocked down, and complained of pain in the hip ; but there was neither shortening nor eversion of the limb, and its several motions coidd be exercised with perfect freedom and power. He died with intestinal disease five weeks after the accident. The case is described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xiii, p. 511. London, 1825. 787. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting an intra-capsular fracture of its neck. The plane of the fracture is vertical, extending from the upper margin of the head straight downwards through the neck to the outer part of its lower border. Bristles are introduced between the fractured surfaces, which are in close apposition, and it will be observed that the attachment of the capsule to the bones is entirely beyond the line of the fracture. That portion of the neck of the bone which remained connected with the trochanters is partly absorbed, and the union of the fractured surfaces, although not complete, is by osseous matter inlaid between them. ni. 50 The person from whom this specimen was taken was 18 years of age. In a fall from a cart lie injured his right hip ; such symptoms ensued as gave rise to the belief that he had dislocated the head of the femur into the foramen ovale. Efforts at reduction were accordingly made. About three months after the injury he died with small pox.

" The history of the case is clearly that of fracture of the neck of the Femur; the appearances of the bone show that there has been a fracture which has re- united by an osseous medium; and the direction of the fracture is such as, in my opinion, can permit of no doubt that it was confined to the portion of the neck of the bone covered by synovial membrane ; consequently that it was wholly within the capsule. The fracture extends through the base of the head of the bone in the line of its junction with the neck. As in other cases of the same kind, great part of the neck of the bone has disappeared, and in consequence the head is proportionately nearer to the trochanter major and shaft of the bone; its re-union has in fact taken place, in part to the remaining portion of the neck, and in part to the shaft. This union is certainly osseous. In addition to the first maceration of the bone with its surrounding soft parts, it was subsequently immersed for several days in a strong solution of carbonate of potash; and one- half of the bone has been boiled in water for three hours without the slightest yielding perceptible in the line of the fracture." ill. 107 Description of the specimen by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxiv, p. 13.

Section of a fractured Rib, which has united with displacement and overlapping of its ends. The firm union of the two portions of the rib has been effected by the abundant deposit of osseous substance in the texture of the periosteum and contiguous cellular tissue around, for some way above, and below the fracture. A spiculum of bone projects from one side of the rib; this was probably a fragment separated by the fracture, and re-united to the outer surface of the rib. IIL 81 799.

The ends of the two portions overlap each other nearly an inch ; and a firm union of them is effected by new bone, formed between those surfaces, which, in their overlapping, were opposed to, and partly in contact with, each other. No new bone or callus is formed at any other part. The periosteum and the tissues adjacent to the bones appeared healthy, except in having small effusions of blood in them. HI. 113 800. Part of a Humerus fractured transversely. The fractured ends overlie each other, and are united by an irregular, dense, bony deposit, which forms an imperfect investment.

The bone is much shortened by the riding of the upper fragment over the lower. The fragments are firmly united by large masses of callus which occupy the interspace between, and partially surround them. The rough edges of the bone are thinned, and were apparently undergoing absorption. 111 ■ 128 802. Section of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture through the middle of its shaft. The section was made after softening the bone in dilute hydro- chloric acid. The fracture is firmly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting in front, and on the inner side of the lower. The uniting medium consists of bone placed between the adjacent surfaces of the displaced portions of the femur; and in this new bone there are formed cancellous tissue of healthy aspect, and an outer thick wall of compact tissue. This wall of the uniting medium of new bone is connected with the surfaces of the two portions of the f'i smttr, and with the layers of compact new bone by which their medullary tubes exposed by the fracture, and not placed in apposition, are covered in. The corresponding parts of the walls of the overlapping ends of the fragments are thinned, as if in the progress of absorption by which, ultimately, the can- cellous tissue of the uniting medium would have become continuous with that of both portions of the broken bone. in. 98 803.

The union has taken place with a great accumulation of bone about the lines of fracture. C. 51 (In Case H.) 831. Section of a Femur at the part where it had been the seat of a comminuted fracture. Around the bone the periosteum is thickened, as seen in portions detached from the subjacent tissue. In the centre of the preparation is a mass of bone, separated from the remainder of the shaft at the time of the accident. Its compact walls are greatly thickened ; in more than half its extent they entirely replace the cancellous structure and the medullary canal. Of the latter only a small isolated portion still remains. At one extremity there is firm, bony union between the shaft and the portion of bone above described. At the other, where the great compactness and induration exist, a line of soft tissue, in which are scanty spicula of bone, intervenes between it and the shaft. Nevertheless, by means of bone thrown out from the periosteum, the two portions were held together. Death occurred from other causes six weeks after the injury. in. 127 From the collection of the late Mr. Lonsdale. 832. Sections of a Tibia, showing the reparative results of inflammation after a compound fracture. The union of the fractured ends of the bone is effected by an irregular and very abundant deposit of hard and heavy new bone; and for a considerable space above and below the place of union, the medullary tissue is consolidated. The surrounding tissues, thickened and indurated, were firmly adherent to the surface of the bone above and below the place of union. A portion of the thickened tissue has been detached and turned downwards. i. 89 833. A portion of the Fibula from the same limb as the preceding.

The overlapping ends of the bones are united by thick tough layers of fibrous tissue. They have been in part separated, to show the mode of their union. in. 41 838. Sections of the upper part of a Femur, in which a vertical intra-capsular fracture occurred. The portion of the neck, which was connected with the shaft, is nearly absorbed ; the portion connected with the head remains, and its lower margin rests, as on a ledge, on the trochanter minor and the cancellous tissue within it. The fractured surfaces are united by a thick layer of tough fibrous tissue, permitting a slight degree of motion between them. ill. 119 839. Sections of the upper part of a Femur fractured almost vertically through the neck, at the base of the head and entirely within the capsule. The neck and the upper part of the shaft have been drawn a little upwards, and the lower part of the fractured surface and margin of the neck, has been driven tightly into the cancellous tissue of the head. In this position, without any lateral displacement, and without any absorption of the neck of the femur, the frac- tured surfaces have been united by a thin layer of tough fibrous tissue, which permitted them to be slightly moved on one another. The fibrous covering of the neck appears to have been torn across and re-united in front, but to have remained entire behind. All the textures adjacent to the fracture are healthy, but the walls of the bone are thin, and its cancellous tissue is atrophied and full of soft fat. in. 110 The patient was a very old woman. The fracture occurred about threo months before death. 840. Portion of a Femur, in which an intra-capsular fracture of the neck occurred many years before death.

Section of a Patella, which has been fractured transversely. There is no bony union ; and no production of new bone. The surfaces of the fracture have undergone but little change. In consequence of the insertion of the extensor tendon, and ligamentum patellae chiefly into the free or external surface of the bone, the fragments have been drawn asunder to a greater extent externally than at their articular surface, so that a wedge-shaped interval exists which in front measures one inch and a-half, towards the joint surface only six-tenths of an inch. Ligamentous material has been produced from the whole of both fractured surfaces : but in front this has undergone stretching, while towards the joint surface it constitutes a strong, thick, and wide conncctino- band between the fragments.INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 122 842. Section of a Patella which has been fractured into three pieces. The portions are united by a thick ligamentous substance, and are all enlarged; the upper fragment alone is as large, and has the same form as an ordinary adult patella : the enlargement is probably due to ossification of the uniting medium. in. 29 843.

A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an ununited fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, with obliteration of the axillary artery from the pressure of the lower portion of the bone against it. The fracture extends transversely through the humerus, immediately below its head and tuberosities ; and it communicates with the cavity of the shoulder-joint. A small detached piece of the bone is connected with the synovial membrane. The synovial membrane is thickened, and its internal surface rough. A bristle is passed beneath the tendon of the biceps. The axillary artery is obliterated, to the extent of half an inch, in the situation at which the end of the lower portion of the humerus pressed against it. Immediately above the obliterated part, the subscapular artery arises, of its usual size. It is still pervious. Close to the subscapular is the posterior circumflex artery, obliterated in the first half inch from its origin, and then pervious by means of the collateral circulation. About two inches above the origin of the subscapular, a large branch arises from the axillary artery; this branch, extending down the inside of the arm, was continued into one of the arteries of the fore-arm, and formed a principal channel for transmitting blood from the upper to the lower part of the limb. III. 74 From a man aged 75. The injury occurred ten years before death. 846. A Humerus, fractured transversely through the junction of its middle and lower thirds, six months before death. No union has taken place between the fractured portions : their ends overlap nearly an inch, and are enclosed in a cavity smoothly walled in by the indurated tissues around them. The end of the upper fragment is rounded and made conical by the absorption of its borders, and is covered with granulations, which in the recent state were soft, vascular, and very florid ; the end of the lower fragment is in part adherent to the adjacent tissues, and in part, similarly covered with granulations. in. 122 The patient was 60 years old. No pus existed in the cavity enclosing the ends of the bone, nor did any opening lead into it from without. The parts are represented in the Drawing, No. 52. 847. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting an intra-capsular fracture of its neck, which occurred about five months before death. The periosteal and synovial cover- ings are torn upon only the posterior side of the neck of the bone ; upon its anterior side they are entire. The portion of the neck which remains con- nected with the head of the femur is not absorbed, but the margins are rounded. 1IL 40123 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). The patient, a middle-aged man, fell in the street, and his hip struck against the curb-stone. Immediately afterwards the limb was inverted, and an inch shorter^han the> other; bub no crepitus was felt. In the suspicion that dislocation existed, repeated attempts at reduction were made. The case is recorded by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico- Chirurgxcal Transactions, vol. xiii, p. 508. London, 1825. 848. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting an intra-capsular fracture of the neck of the Femur, which occurred many years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed. Bristles are passed beneath three thick fibrous bands, which extend from the fractured surface of the head of the bone to the capsule. The capsule is generally thickened, and the fractured surfaces are covered by thin smooth layers of fibrous tissue. m- 849. Portion of a Femur, in which fracture of the neck occurred many years before death. There has been complete absorption of the neck of the bone. The surfaces of the head and of the space between the trochanters which have been in contact, and which probably moved freely on each other, are very hard, polished, and ivory-like. ni. 17 850. Portion of a Femur with the Acetabulum, exhibiting a fracture of the neck of the femur, which occurred fifteen years before death. The neck of the bone is absorbed. The opposite surfaces of the head and shaft, which hav^e been in apposition, are covered by a layer of hard osseous substance. There is a considerable deposit of new bone at the bottom of the acetabulum, and upon the head of the femur. c. 76 The signs of fracture of the neck of the femur were not present till six weeks after the injury, and two weeks after the patient had begun to walk on crutches. (In Case H.) Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 851. Portions of a Femur, of which the neck was fractured, near the margin of the head, many years before death. The remains of the neck have been nearly absorbed. The fractured surface of the head is adapted to the surface of the short portion of the neck which remains between the trochanters, and to a growth of bone proceeding from it downwards. Both the surfaces thus adapted are very hard, polished, ivory-like, and penetrated by numerous foramina. C. 105 (In Case H.) 852. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a fracture of its'neck, of which no union has taken place. The neck of the bone is almost completely absorbed and the surfaces by which the fractured portions were in contact are rough and hard. Deposits of osseous substance have taken place around the base of the head of the femur. C. 50 From an old woman ; the fracture occurred nineteen years before death. (In Case H.) Presented by J. H. B. Williams, Esq. 853. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting fracture of its neck, of which there is no union. The surfaces of the head, and of the space between the trochanters, which were in contact, are nearly smooth and very hard. Irregular osseous deposits have taken place around the fractured surface of the neck, and upon the head of the bone. c 59 (In Case H.) ' 854. The right Femur of a child 11 years old, which was fractured in the middle third of its shaft, four years before death, and in which no osseous union of the fragments took place. The whole of the bone is exceedingly atrophied. The lower end of the upper portion is enlarged, light, and porous, as if by expansion or rarefaction of its tissue. The upper end of the lower portion isINJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 124 irregularly excavated as if by ulceration; the walls of the remainder of this portion are very thin, light, and dry, and in many places perforated by absorp- tion, i. 265 The child died with disease of the mesenteric glands. The left tibia and fibula were two inches longer than the right. Presented by William Taylor, Esq. 855. A Knee-Joint, from a person who fractured the patella many years before death, and recovered complete use of the limb, although no union of the frag- ments took place. In the extended position of the limb, the fragments of the patella are about four inches apart; their broken surfaces are turned obliquely forwards, and are smooth, and thinly covered with fibrous tissue; their posterior borders are tightly connected with the synovial and fibrous capsules of the joint, which hold tliem in their places; there is no direct or new-fotmied bond of union between them. in. 123 856. The Femur of a Sheep fractured, long before death, through the upper part of its shaft. The fractured surfaces, though adapted to one another, have not united ; but new bone is abundantly formed ujoon and around them. III. 117 UNUNITED FRACTURES ON WHICH AN OPERATION FOR REPAIR HAS BEEN PERFORMED. 857. Ununited fracture of the Femur treated by resection of the broken ends, and the insertion of steel pegs. The holes for the pegs are increased in size, and are surrounded by new periosteal bone. The fragments could not be kept sufficiently at rest, and no union took place. The fracture was simple, but very oblique. It was treated in the Hospital throughout; at the end of nine months resection was performed; two months later the limb was amputated. The knee-joint, which had been kept in the extended position by a weight for a considerable time, is anchylosed. The cartilages are ulcerated in several places.—See Lawrence Ward Booh, vol. iii, p. 33, and Path. Soc. Trans., vol. xxv, p. 212, 1874. 858. The Shaft of a right Tibia and Fibula. At the junction of the lower with the upper two-thirds, the bones are connected only by ligamentous tissue, but are in good position. Both bones are ill-developed. The tibia is flattened from side to side ; the whole bone is bent forwards and the anterior margin projects in a prominent curved spine. The tissue of the shaft appears thick- ened. The lower third of the tibia tapers gradually to its junction with the upper two-thirds, where it is extoemely small The fibula is very slender and flattened. Two pieces of glass rod are inserted through the junction of the two portions of the tibia, to mark the holes into which wire pins were inserted in the operation of osteotomy. Two of the apertures are much enlarged from absorption of the bone. The bones were removed by amputation from a young man, aged 21 years, who was ad- mitted to the Hospital with a congenital deformity of the leg. The limb was bent forwards and outwards, and the foot turned inwards, giving the appearance of talipes varus. An un- united congenital fracture was diagnosed, which was now yielding. Osteotomy was performed, a wedge-shaped piece of bone being removed, and the fragments were wired together. A month after the operation firm union had apparently taken place, but the uniting material subse- quently yielded, and amputation was finally performed below the knee.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. vi. 859. Part of a right Femur just above its middle, showing the extremities of an ununited fracture. There are deposits of new bone scattered over either portion, the medulla being closed by a compact layer of dense osseous tissue. The apertures indicate the spots where ivory pegs were introduced. The depressions are lined with new bone from which spicula irregularly project. C. 121L25 INJURIES 01 BONIS (FRACTURES). In consequence of the failure of all remedial measures, the limb was amputated immediately below the hip-joint. The palient eventually recovered. (In Case 11.) FALSE JOINTS (Pseudoarthroses). 860. The Scapular end of a Clavicle, with a small portion of bone united to it by a distinct joint. It is probable that this had been separated by fracture. 861 Portion of a Humerus, in which fracture of the shaft occurred many years before death. The ends of the bone did not unite : they are somewhat enlarged, are covered by a substance like fibro-cartilage, and connected by a distinct membranous capsule, which is smooth upon its internal surface, and serves as a kind of capsular ligament to the false joint which is formed between the ununited portions of the bone. m- ® From a middle-aged woman : the fracture was produced by a slight muscular effort. 862. Portion of a Humerus, in the middle of the shaft of which is an ununited fracture which occurred four years before death. The ends of the bone are enlarged, accurately adapted to each other, and have acquired a hard polished surface on those portions between which there was friction during the movements of the arm. 2 The use of the arm was so little impaired by the fracture that the patient worked as a sailor to the time of his death. Presented by P. Brendon, Esq. 863. Cast of the left Humerus of Dr. Livingstone, showing a False Joint a little above the centre of the bone. The fracture was caused by the bite of a lion thirty years before his death. The left humerus was one inch shorter than the right. The lower portion of the shaft is slightly rotated outwards. A small piece of detached bone was found lying in a cyst in front of the fracture.—See Lancet, vol. i, 1874, pp. 565 and 888. 864. The Upper part of a Femur, and sections of an Os Innominatum. On the upper part of the shaft of the femur there are no remains of the head or neck; but between the trochanters is a large and slightly convex surface, increased by broad flat growths of bone from its sides. The cavity of the acetabulum is nearly filled up; there remains only a slight concavity adapted to the surface between the trochanters. The notch of the acetabulum, and the space at which the vessels entered, remain distinct. The form of the osseous substance by which the acetabulum is filled up, makes it probable that it is the head of the femur, which was separated, while it was still an epiphysis, and subsequently united by bone to the walls of the acetabulum. c. 112 This supposition is made more probable by the history of the case. The patient was a woman 60 years of age, who, when she was 8 years old, had a fall on her hip, and was believed to have fractured her thigh. Her limb remained permanently short; but she had never had abscesses, or any other sign of ulcerative disease of the hip-joint. (In Case H.) Presented by Henry James, Esq. 865. Section of the Femur of an old man, in which a fracture through the base of its neck, and through the upper part of the great trochanter, occurred many years before death. The neck was driven into the upper part of the shaft between the trochanters ; and in this situation a layer of compact bone has been formed on the whole of the broken surface of the cancellous tissue of the shaft and trochanters, in such a manner as to form a smooth excavation, in which the neck of the femur rests. To this excavated surface the neck of the126 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). femur,—itself also covered by compact bone,—was connected by ligamentous tissue. The fracture through the trochanter is completely united by bone. in. 76 NECROSIS OF FRACTURED BONES (Deviations from the Ordinary Process of Repair in consequence of). 866. Portion of a Humerus, which has been fractured near the middle of its shaft. New bone is formed upon its outer surface, immediately above and below the fracture. The extremity of the lower portion of the bone has perished, and is in process of exfoliation. The fractured surfaces were united by soft connective tissue ; and a distinct capsule has been formed around the ends of the bone by the condensation of the surrounding cellular tissue. III. 58 From a girl 23 years old. The fracture was caused by external violence six years before death ; she was at the time affected with syphilis. Presented by William Taylor, Esq. 867. Section of the shaft of a Femur, exhibiting a fistulous cavity in its interior, with Necrosis of a small portion of the inner layers of its wall. Two bristles are placed in a groove extending to some depth between the dead, and the contiguous living, bone. A vascular membrane, having a soft velvet-like surface, lines the fistulous cavity in the bone. I. 176 The limb was removed by amputation. Thirty-five years previous to the amputation, the fenmr was fractured; this was followed by abscess in the soft parts, and the formation of a fistulous passage extending into the cavity in the interior of the bone, which passage remained open during the whole period from the time of the fracture to the removal of the limb. Presented by James Pritchard, Esq., Leamington. 868. The other half of the bone, No. 867, macerated. I. 177 869. A Tibia, showing a fracture at the centre of the shaft. There is no osseous union, but the fragments are kept in apposition by fibrous tissue continuous with the thickened periosteum. The ends of the bone are sclerosed and thickened, and the medullary canal is obliterated for some distance. Two or three small fragments of necrosed bone were found between the fractured extremities. The specimen was taken from a boy aged 11, who sustained a compound fracture of the leg by direct violence. The fracture apparently united, and he was sent to the convalescent home, but returned in a fortnight with slight inflammation about the fracture, and febrile symptoms, followed by pysemia, of which he died six and a half months after the occurrence of the fracture.—See Colston Ward Book, vol. v, p. 316. 870. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, which suffered Necrosis after a compound fracture. The fractured ends of both bones overlap, and exfoliation of the ends of the tibia has commenced. There is a superficial groove between the dead and the living bone, with an irregular deposit of new bone upon the contiguous surface of the latter. I. 87 871. Section of a Tibia, in which a compound fractnre occurred six months before death. The fractured surfaces, displaced and overlapping, are consolidated by bony matter. The extremity of one of the portions of fractured bone, separated either by the fracture or by exfoliation, lies loose in a cavity between the fractured surfaces. The portion of bone at the bottom of the bottle was found loose in the same cavity. III. 99 872. Sections of a Tibia and a Fibula, from the same limb as the preceding speci- men. The tibia is broken about one-third from its upper end ; and its two portions, separated to some distance from each other, are held together by new bone abundantly deposited around their external surfaces. Separate fragments of bone were found loose in the osseous cavity between the ends of the fractured portions. A small detached portion of the wall of the tibia has also been drivenINJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 127 into the cancellous tissue of the upper part of the shaft, m 'Inch t now lies armly imbedded. The fibula is fractured two inches below its head the two portions overlap each other considerably, and are united by a bridge of osseous material extending obliquely between their lateral surfaces. 0. va (In Case H.) 873 Sections of a Tibia and Fibula. There has been a compound fracture of both bones about two inches above the ankle-joint. A vacancy is seen m the tibia in the situation of the fracture, from which probably a portion of bone has been removed, and at the bottom of which there is a piece of dead bone not yet separated. A portion of the fibula also has necrosed, and is partially separated. The upper and lower fragments of the tibia have not approximated, but are united by a strong bridge or splint of bone behind them, and there is a firm and extensive union of the tibia to the fibula, at and below the seat of fracture. The fracture of the fibula is firmly and smoothly united c. 21 (In Case H.) 874. Portions of a Tibia, Fibula, Astragalus, and Os Calcis, from a limb in which compound fracture of the lower end of the tibia and fibula occurred two years previous to amputation. There is an abundant deposit of osseous substance around the fractured portions of the tibia and fibula. Two portions of bone, one belonging to the articular end of the tibia, the other comprising all that remained of the astragalus, were found loose in the cavity of the ankle-joint, and in a deep ulcerated cavity in the lower end of the tibia. The small portion of the os calcis which remains retains but little of the natural form of the bone. c- (In Case H.) 875. The Bones of a Leg, exhibiting the effects of a compound fracture of both of them near the ankle, and of a simple fracture of the tibia near the knee-joint. Near the ankle, the fractured portions are irregularly united at a right angle with each other, the lower portions being turned inwards. In the lower part of the tibia there is a large irregular cavity, communicating both externally and with the joint, in which several loose pieces of bone were contained. The upper part of the shaft of the fibula has not united with the lower part, but the latter is firmly fixed to the tibia. The fractured portions of the head of the tibia are firmly, but irregularly, united. C. 106 These injuries were the consequences of an accident which occurred a year before amputation.

A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture extending from the middle of the frontal to the posterior part of the right parietal bone has been firmly united. It has the appearance of a sabre-wound. C. 45 (In Case H.) 877. A Skull, in which there have been two wounds, each about an inch and a half in length, one in the frontal, and the other in the left parietal bone. They have both been healed.

The inner surface, over a con-INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 128 siderable extent of both portions, is roughened and tubereulated by deposit of new bone. From a man, aged 37, who, nine months before his death, fell off a van and injured his head. A week before his death he had an epileptic fit, and a succession of fits a few hours before he died. (In Case H.) 879. Posterior portion of the right Parietal Bone of a boy aged 3 years, showing a compound depressed fracture of the skull. The small portion of bone sus- pended was detached and found lying on the dura mater. Death took place from meningitis.—See Laivrence Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 172. 880. Portion of the Parietal Bone of a child, on which a sharp piece of a chimney- pot fell from a house-top. It made a circular aperture in the skull, half an inch in diameter, and forced the bone which was included within this circle into the substance of the brain. Portions of the bone thus driven in remain attached to the margin of the aperture. III. 116 The child remained for three weeks with scarcely any of the usual symptoms of injury of the brain. Inflammation of the brain then ensued, and soon ended fatally. 881. Part of the Parietal Bone of an infant, with an effusion of blood between the skull and dura mater. This effusion, as well as a similar effusion between the skull and the pericranium, appeared to have proceeded (at least in part) from a fissure, about an inch long, through the parietal bone, at the margin of the effusion. The blood forms a circumscribed oval layer, about half an inch thick, and is coagulated. Thin plates of porous new bone have been formed in the dura mater around part of the margin elevated by the effused blood, as well as in distinct patches nearer to the centre of the part thus elevated. The bone appears to be formed between the two layers of the dura mater: a portion of the inner layer is reflected from the surface of the new bone over which it lay, and is indicated by a bristle. A small quantity of new bone is also formed on the inner surface of the skull, near the margin of the effused blood : but there is no appearance of any being formed beneath the blood. vi. 71 The infant was twenty-five clays old, when it died with convulsions, which had commenced two clays before its death. Previous to these it had been healthy, with the exception of a slight diarrhoea The case is related by Dr. West, and the preparation is engraved, in the Medico-Ch irm-fjical Transact ions, vol. xxviii, p. 397. London, 1845. Presented by Dr. "West. 882. The right Occipital Portion of the posterior Fossa of the base of the Skull from a girl aged 9 years, showing a circular depressed fracture, the size of a shilling. The onter table, though depressed, is apparently entire, with the exception of a fissure, which extends along one-third of the margin of the depression. The inner table is fissured in three or four places. The fracture was not detected during life. 883. A Skull-Cap, in which a fracture with depression of the left parietal bone occurred many years before death. The fracture comprised a circle of bone, an inch in diameter, which was starred at its centre and surrounded by a nearly circular fissure. The fracture is united, but the depression still remains; the centre of the depressed portion is nearly half an inch below the level of the contiguous internal surface of the skull. c. 43 (In Case H.) 884. A Skull, showing a deep funnel-shaped indentation with rounded edges which penetrated the bone obliquely at a point posterior to the parietal eminence. A portion of the internal table, as large as a crown piece, has been detached, but is now imperfectly united to the skull. For a considerable distance around the121) INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). depression, both on the vertex and base of the skull, the bone is extremely thickened and somewhat indurated. The history is unknown. (In Case H.) 885. Section of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting a comminuted circumscribed fracture of the outer and inner tables of one of the parietal bones. Many pieces of the inner table are depressed. I1L ^4 During life the outer table was raised by the elevator, and it was supposed that the instru- ment was acting upon the whole thickness of the skuJ], whereas the fragments of the inner table remained unmoved. 886. Section of a Skull-Cap, exhibiting a fracture extending in several directions through the anterior part of the parietal bones. In one situation there is a fracture of the outer, without any corresponding fracture of the inner, table. in. 83 887. A Skull-Cap, in which fracture with loss of bone was produced by the wheel of a cart passing over the head several years before death. The frontal and right parietal bones were broken into many pieces, and the sagittal and coronal sutures were separated. Several portions of bone, which were detached by the fracture, were removed, leaving numerous and considerable apertures in the skull; other detached portions are thinned by absorption, but their edges are re-united by osseous substance. Considerable thickening of the frontal bone has taken place in one situation contiguous to the fracture. No new bone appears to have been formed in the spaces left after the removal of the loose fragments. in. 63 888. Portion of a Skull, in which an extensive fracture of the adjacent parts of the occipital and parietal bones occurred four years before death. Some portions of bone, detached by the fracture, were removed at the time of the accident; other portions were left, and have been re-united by bone. There is also a close union by bone of two lines of fracture, extending outwards through the parietal bones. The margins of all the broken portions of bone have been smoothly rounded, and their exposed diploe is covered in by compact bone. in. 38 Vide Nos. 741, 744, and789. 889. The right Temporal Bone. A fracture passes from the upper part of the squamous portion just below the squamous suture, perpendicularly down through both the upper and lower walls of the external auditory meatus. It then extends through the petrous bone, passing across the tympanum, in front of the superior semicircular canal into the internal auditory meatus, and apparently traversing the base of the cochlea. The line of fracture then extends from the lower part of the internal auditory meatus into that portion of the foramen lacerum posterius which transmits the eighth pair of nerves. The anterior and posterior portions of the petrous bone are therefore completely severed at the level of the external and internal auditory meatuses. The membrana tympani has been exposed by the removal of the bone ; it is soft and much swollen ; there is a large perforation just below the processus gracilis. A rent appears to have passed vertically through the middle of the membrane, the upper part of which is now glued together by lymph. The tympanum and anterior mastoid cells have been laid open; lymph was found in both situations. The bones of the internal ear are not disturbed. A coloured injection, which was thrown into the external meatus by plugging the opening with a cork, passed without using the slightest force through the internal auditory meatus and escaped from within the sheath of the seventh pair of nerves. From a child, aged 13 months, who fell off a bed and struck its head against a mangle. K130 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). The child was admitted to the hospital with vomiting, insensibility, and bleeding from the right ear. The next day there was a profuse discharge of clear watery fluid from the external meatus, continuing until death took place from meningitis on the third day after the accident. —See Stanley Ward Book, vol. vii. The case is described by Mr. Eve in the Clinical Society's Transactions, vol. xiii, 1880. 890. The greater portion of a Temporal Bone removed from the base of a skull which was fractured. The Hue of fracture passes through the external auditory meatus into the tympanum, detaching the portion of bone forming the upper wall of the meatus. It passes through the carotid canal and detaches the apex of the petrous bone. The internal auditory meatus is intact, and the labyrinth appears not to have been involved in the fracture. IIL 130 891. Portions of the middle and posterior fossae of the base of the Skull. A line of fracture extends from the foramen magnum across the groove for the lateral sinus and the foramen lacerum posterius, and vertically through the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In its course it passes through the auditory meatuses, the tympanum and vestibule, and divides the membrana tympani. The line of fracture also extends upwards for a short distance through the squamous portion of the temporal bone. The patient died with the symptoms produced by a fracture of the base of the skull. The case is fully reported in the Medical Times and Gazette, 1863, vol. i, p. 185. (In Case H.) 892. A portion of the right side of the base of a Skull. A fracture extends vertically through the petrous portion of the temporal bone, traversing the external auditory meatus and labyrinth.

A Comminuted Fracture of the lower extremity of the left Humerus. A transverse fracture passes obliquely through the bone above the level of the condyles, and a vertical fracture extending from this into the elbow-joint, sepa- rates the capitellum from the remainder of the articular surface of the humerus. From a man, aged 47, who died after secondary amputation of the arm. The injury was produced by a fall upon the elbow. (In Case H.) 913. The bones of an Elbow-Joint. A fracture extends in two directions through the internal condyle of the humerus into the elbow-joint. The two portions of the condyle separated by the fracture have not been reunited by bone. c. 38 (In Case H.) 914. The bones of an Elbow-Joint. The humerus has been fractured obliquely between the condyles, and transversely a little above them. The fractures are firmly united, but the internal condyle is flattened and elongated The articular surface of the ulna is adapted to this altered form of the humerus. It is uncertain whether the ulna has been broken. C. 36 (In Case H.) 915. A Humerus, which has been fractured in several directions, but chiefly obliquely downwards, just above the condyles.

A Radius and Ulna, the former fractured about its middle, the latter at a corresponding point, and also at its lower third. The articular surface of the radius at the wrist is rough and irregular from the formation upon it of new bone, and a similar appearance is presented by the corresponding extremity of the ulna. c. 128 (In Case H.) 921. A Radius and Ulna, both of which have been fractured about three inches above their carpal ends. The ends of the bones overlap and have united in this position, with considerable shortening and deflection towards the ulnar side. c. 73 (In Case II.) 922. A Radius and Ulna.

Parts of a Radius and Ulna, with adjacent carpal bones. The radius is fractured at its carpal extremity, the proximal portion of the bone being driven into the distal extremity, completely crushing it. The fracture extends in many places into the wrist-joint. The proximal portion of the shaft is displaced inwards, carrying with it the ulna; the latter bone is torn away from the triangular ligament to which the top of the styloid process remains attached. The scaphoid is broken across about its middle, and between the two fragments the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevior was firmly gripped, and is still held.

The man received, at the same time, such severe internal injuries, that he died a few hours after his admission. 926. Portions of a Radius and Ulna. The radius has been fractured a little more than an inch above its carpal end. The union is firm, bat there is a prominent angle on the dorsal aspect in the line of the fracture, and an elevation of new bone on the corresponding part of the palmar surface, where it is probable that the palmar margin of the upper fragment was driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one. The triangular fibro-cartilage was almost completely separated from the radius. Ill, 89 A Cast of the wrist is preserved, No. 25. 927. Section of the Radius of a young man, which has been fractured three- quarters of an inch above its carpal articular surface. The dorsal margin of the upper fragment is driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one : their palmar margins are in contact, but a projecting angle is here formed, in the front of the wrist, at the line of fracture. The fracture is united, and new bone is formed in the angle between the displaced dorsal margins of the fragments. in. 78 928. Sections of a Radius. At its carpal end there has been a transverse fracture immediately above the line of the epiphysis, and the posterior or dorsal margin of the upper fragment has been driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower one. The palmar margin of the upper fragment projects forwards, or in the direction of the palm ; and the dorsal surface of the lower fragment projects far backwards, similarly to that in No. 927, but differently from that in No. 926, The fracture is united, and a buttress of new bone has formed on the dorsal and radial sides of the displaced portions. III. 94 929. A Radius and Ulna. The radius has been broken about three-quarters of an inch above its lower end. The fracture is united, with the lower portion of bone displaced towards the radial and dorsal aspect of the upper portion. In consequence of the shortening of the radius, induced by this displacement, a new articular surface has been formed on the lower end of the ulna, by the growth of a half-ring of bone upwards from the margin of the surface by which it before articulated with the radius. The carpal articular surface of the ulna thus projects far beyond that of the radius. C. 31 (In Case H.) 930. Portion of a Radius, which has been fractured about an inch above its lower end. The fracture has united with a considei'able overlapping of the ends of the bone, the palmar margin of the upper portion projecting with a sharp edge towards the palm, while its posterior or dorsal margin is driven into the cancellous tissue of the lower portion. The lower portion with the carpal articular surface of the radius is consequently deflected strongly backwards, or towards the dorsal region of the fore-arm. C. 35 (In Case H.) Vide Nos. 924, 1030. Separation of Lower Epiphyses. 931. The carpal extremities of the Left Radius and Ulna. The portion of the radius is separated from the shaft at the line of the epiphysis, and a fracture extends into the wrist-joint.

Portion of an Os Innominatum, exhibiting a united fracture, with absorption of bone, in the bottom of the acetabulum. The fracture extended in several directions from the centre of the acetabulum to its circumference. III. 02 The fracture was caused by a fall on the trochanter major a few months before death. 936. The Bones of a Hip-Joint. A fracture extends in several directions through the os innominatum. The fracture through the bottom of the acetabulum permitted the head of the femur to sink into the cavity of the pelvis. 0. 64 These injuries were the effects of a fall from a considerable height. (In Case H.) 937. An Os Innominatum. A fracture has split the acetabulum into four portions which are widely separated. From the acetabulum as a centre, fractures also extend through the body and ramus of the pubes ; through the ischium between its spine and tuberosity; and through the ilium, vertically to its crest, and obliquely to its anterior spine. C. 40 (In Case H.) 938. An Os Innominatum. A fracture extends in two directions through the acetabulum. The posterior wall of the acetabulum being separated, and held in its place only by the cotyloid ligament, permitted the head of the femur to pass upwards upon the dorsum of the ilium.

The synovial and periosteal membranes are entire on the posterior surface of the neck. in. 54 945. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a vertical fracture, of recent occurrence, through the intra-capsular portion of its neck. Upon the anterior half of the circumference of the neck of the bone, the periosteal and synovial coverings are torn : upon the posterior half they are entire. in. 7 946. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting an intra-capsular fracture through its neck. The direction of the fracture is such, that the surface of the bone exhibits on the one side an eminence, and on the other a corresponding cavity. The periosteum and the synovial membrane covering the neck are torn in only the anterior half of its circumference: upon the other half, the membranes are entire and still connect the two parts of the bone, which may thus, as well as by the mutual adaptation of the uneven surfaces of the fracture, have been held together with very little displacement. ill. 18 947. Portion of a Femur, in which there is a fracture extending vertically through the neck, from the upper margin of the head to the middle of the lower margin of the neck. » C. 55 (In Case H.) 948.

A Section through the tipper part of a Femur, showing a fracture at the base of the neck, which is driven into the upper part of the shaft. The neck has undergone absorption to a considerable extent, and the cavity in which it lies has probably been enlarged by the same process. ni. 77 From a woman 85 years old. The fracture occurred three years before death. Presented by William Radnor, Esq. 952. Portion of a Femur, showing a fracture of its neck. The upper portion of the shaft is extensively comminuted. The trochanters are entire. III. 16 953. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a fracture through its neck, and another completely detaching the great trochanter from the shaft. Two distinct lines of fracture may be traced," one across the base of the neck, the other passing obliquely through the shaft just in front of, and below the trochanter major, and through the trochanter minor. The base of the neck is fixed between the fragments, but not tightly. HI. 14 954. Portion of a Femur, showing, as in the last described, a fracture through the base of the neck, and separating the greater portion of the trochanter major and the trochanter minor from the shaft. One line of fracture passes vertically through the base of the neck ; the other extends vertically through the middle of the great trochanter and for about three inches down the shaft, and through the trochanter minor. The head is impacted between the fragments, and osseous union has taken place in the lower part of the vertical fracture. in. 15 955. Portions of a Femur in which there has been fracture through the base of the neck, and, apparently, a fracture through the trochanter major. The base of the neck has been driven into the cancellous tissue between the trochanters, in which situation it is firmly united by bone and fibrous tissue. The fracture of the trochanter has been firmly united by bone. ni. 12 956. Portion of a Femur, in which fracture of the neck and of the trochanter major occurred six weeks before death. The direction of the fracture is still evident; it extended through the base of the neck, and through the base of the trochanter major, nearly detaching this process from the rest of the bone. The head and neck were forced downwards and impacted between the trochanters. The several parts of the bone thus brought into contact are united so firmly that they could not be moved upon each other. in. 10 957. Specimen of impacted fracture of the neck of the Femur. n. 94 From an old man, aged 84 years, who lived for two years after the injury. The parts are well united. Presented by Tory Hester, Esq. 958. Upper portion of a Femur, showing an extra-capsular fracture of the neck, with no evident displacement. The attachment of the ilio-femoral ligament in front of the trochanter major is not torn through. There was no appreciable shortening of the limb, and slight eversion only was observed during life, probably owing to the condition of the above-mentioned ligament—See Colston, Ward Book, vol. v, p. 348. 959. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been a fracture extending throuo-h the base of the neck, and very obliquely through the toochanter major, which is split into two portions separated to some distance from each other.

The upper part of a Femur, in which a fracture extends obliquely down- wards and inwards, from the middle of the great trochanter through the base of the neck, and ends just above the lesser trochanter. There is no union of the fragments, but they are held together by portions of the periosteum, c. 117 From a man, 82 years of age, who died a fortnight after the injury, which was produced by a fall on the floor. The limb, directly after the fracture, was shortened about half an inch, and was inverted, the toe resting on the opposite instep. It was movable and could be everted, but, of itself, it became again inverted. (In Case H.) Presented by Charles Miles, Esq. 961. The head and neck of the right Femur, from an old man aged 85 years. Seven months before his death he fell and fractured the neck of his thigh-bone, and the radius and ulna of the corresponding arm. The latter united perfectly in about six weeks. The femur has been broken in two directions. The bone, divided longitudinally, shows the coarse of these fractures, the principal one of which extends obliquely through the neck. In the posterior portion firm bony union has taken place. The fragments of the anterior portion separated during maceration. c. 131 (In Case H.) Presented by Charles Miles, Esq. 962. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extending through the base of its neck, and obliquely through the base of the trochanter major. The fractured surfaces have firmly united, but the shaft has been drawn upwards and forwards, so that the head and neck of the femur appear much below their natural situation. In this position a bridge of bone has united the base of the head of the femur to the margin of the posterior inter-trochanteric ridge. C. 49 (In Case H.) 963. Sections of a Femur, in which there has been fracture extending obliquely through the trochanter major and the base of the neck into the posterior part of the shaft. There is firm union of the fractured surfaces, but the two portions of the trochanter major are separated to some distance from each other. c. 57 The patient was a woman 60 years old. After a fall on her hip, she had signs which led to the suspicion of dislocation of the head of the femur, for the posterior portion of the fractured trochanter major, being drawn backwards towards the ischiatic notch, felt like the head of the bone. She died about three years after the accident. The case is described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xiii, p. 505. London, 1825. (In Case F.)

Sections of the Head and Neck of a Femur, from an aged woman. On the surface of each section a white line is visible, which extends obliquely from above downwards and in words, in a plane which would include the base of the neck at its upper part and the base of the head at its lower part. The line marks the section of a thin layer of fibrous tissue, and appears to indicate that a fracture of the neck of the femur has been united partly by fibrous tissue and partly by bone. The head of the femur is below the great trochanter, and there139 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). is an accumulation of bone on the posterior surface of the neck, in a lino corre- sponding with the direction of the presumed fracture. ni. Zl 965. Sections of the Head and Neck of the other Femur of the same woman They present the same appearances as those last described, but the line ot abrous tissue is here uninterrupted, while in the preceding it is m some places interrupted by small portions in which the osseous tissue is continuous, as if the fracture had in them united by bone. m- 2* The preparations were taken from a body supplied for dissection, of which no history could be obtained.

B. Oakes, Esq. 967. Portion of a Femur, in which a fracture is believed to have occurred, many years before death, through the base of its neck. The fracture (if one happened) has been completely repaired, for its direction is not indicated by any line in the cancellous texture.

Lower Extremity of Femur. 977. The Lower two-thirds of the shaft of a Femur, showing a comminuted fracture of the lower end of the shaft and of the epiphysis, extending into the knee-joint. The fracture extends nearly vertically along the centre of the shaft to the junction of the lower with the middle third; midway it is joined by a lateral fracture. The fractured surfaces are partially united. Above the upper limit of the fracture is a projecting fragment of new bone, probably formed by a portion of uptorn periosteum. The condyles of the femur are separated, and the anterior portion of the articular surface is detached from them. in. 129 978.

Union of the fracture has not commenced. The articular cartilage is in part absorbed; but this had probably occurred before the fracture. in. 52 984. A Patella, with a small piece of bone, which had probably been broken off, and is now connected by ligament with its lateral border. III. 26 985. A Patella, fractured in three lines leading from the centre to the circumference. The portions are completely and closely united by bone, and with very little displacement, the lower portion alone being pushed somewhat forwards. Some new bone is deposited along the lines of fracture on the anterior surface of the patella; the posterior surface is smooth, and presents no new bone ; the margin of one of the fractures has still the appearance of a fracture of recent occurrence. in. 108 It is probable that the fracture was caused by a blow upon the patella. 986. A Patella, showing a fracture which extends transversely through its lower part. The fractured surfaces are in close apposition, and united by soft fibrous tissue; separation was apparently prevented by the untorn expansion over the bone of the tendon of the quadriceps femoris. The outer portion of the anterior surface of the patella is rough and carious : lying upon it is a small fragment of necrosed bone. From a man, aged 65 years, who was admitted into the Hospital with a slough over the patella, the result of a blow on the part, by which the fracture was probably produced. He was progressing favourably, when he fell down stairs and struck his knee. The joint became painful and much swollen. An incision was made into the joint, and decomposing blood let out; suppuration ensued, and rendered amputation necessary.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 307. 987. Two portions of a fractured Patella, which were united by ligamentous substance. The lower portion is much enlarged and altered in form by the deposit of osseous substance upon its borders. in. 72 988. Section of a Patella, in which there has been a transverse fracture. The fractured surfaces are united by a thick band of ligament, about an inch in length, which is smoothly lined, as if by a continuation of the synovial mem- brane. As in the preceding specimens, the fragments are enlarged, but their texture is unaltered. in. 30 989. A Patella, divided longitudinally. It had been fractured during lvfe, and the separated portions have united by ligament. m. 132INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 142 Obtained from the dissecting rooms.

The upper extremity of a Tibia, with an oblique fracture just below the head, from which a vertical fracture extends through the articular surface into the knee-joint. The fibula was also fractured in a corresponding position. From a man, aged 39 years, who fell down a flight of stairs when intoxicated. He died of delirium tremens three days after the accident.—See Kenton Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 309. Shafts. 991. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured in its middle, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly united, but with displace- ment and overlapping of the fractured ends, so that the tibia at the seat of fracture forms an angle directed backwards, and the fibula an angle directed outwards. Both the bones also are atrophied, and very slender. C. 1 (In Case H.) 992. A Tibia and Fibula, fractured in two places. The bones are firmly united, and osseous tissue seems to have been deposited on portions of the shafts independently of the seats of fracture. In the lower third of the tibia is a considerable cavity, from which fragments of necrosed bone had been removed. C. 124 (In Case H.) 993. A Tibia and Fibula, which were fractured somewhat obliquely near the middle of their shafts. The several portions are firmly united, but with lateral displacement, both the upper fragments being placed on the inner side of the lower ones. The fractured ends are rounded and continuous with the uniting ossifying tissue. C. 110 (In Case H.) 994. A Tibia, which was fractured very obliquely through the middle of its shaft. The fractured portions are firmly united, and so exactly that, on the posterior aspect of the bone, the line of fracture is not discernible. The shaft in the neighbourhood of the injury is thickened, and new bone is deposited on many parts of its surface. c. 109 (In Case H.) 995. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured about one-third from its lower end, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly and smoothly united, but with a slight lateral displacement, the lower fragments converging in the interosseous space. c. 3 (In Case H.) 996. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts; the fractures are united. There is also lateral union of the two bones, and an abundant deposit of new bone above and below the seat of fracture. c. 91 (In Case H.) 997. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, the shafts of which were fractured obliquely about three inches above the ankle. The fractures have been firmly united, but with displacement, the lower portion of the tibia having been carried towards the fibula. C 18 (In Case H.) For other Specimens, see Nos. 767, 805, 807, 824, 825, 832, 834, 835, 844, 858, 869, 870 to 872.INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 143 Lower Extremities of Tibia and Fibula. 998. The lower end of a right Tibia and Fibula, showing a united fracture. The line of fracture is indicated by a roughening of the surface of the tibia and a projection on its inner side just above the internal malleolus : it passes obliquely from the outer side downwards and inwards to the projection just above the internal malleolus. The fracture extends into the joint, separating the articular surface into three nearly equal segments : pieces of glass have been inserted into the libro-cartilage, which unites the fractured articular cartilage. The lower end of the tibia is displaced forward and outward. In order to accommodate the altered shape of the articular surface to the head of the astragalus, a buttress of fibro-cartilage, which is undergoing ossification, has been formed on the anterior margin of the articulation : through this a section has been made to show the healthy cartilage beneath. The fracture of the fibula passes through the bone obliquely, about five inches above the external malleolus: the lower end of the bone is slightly displaced outwards. From a man, aged 42, who fell from a height of about forty feet on to his foot and back. On his admission to the Hospital, a fracture of the tibia and fibula about two inches above the ankle, was diagnosed. In seven weeks the fracture was firmly united. A year later he cut his throat and died in the Hospital, when the specimen was obtained.—See Colston Ward Book, vol. v, p. 213. 999. A partially united "Pott's" Fracture. A fracture extends through the base of the internal malleolus, and there is also an oblique fracture through the fibula two inches above the malleolus. The displacement of the fractured bones is slight. 1000. A united " Pott's " Fracture, at the right Ankle-Joint. There is an oblique fracture of the fibula about an inch and a half above the external malleolus, and the lower end of the bone is driven upwards and outwards. The astra- galus is displaced backwards and outwards, and half of its upper articular surface has passed from under the malleolar arch. There is a buttress of bone posteriorly between the tibia and fibula ; and also a mass of callus between the astragalus and internal malleolus, which was probably thrown out around a piece of bone torn from the internal malleolus. The patient died of dysentery nearly four months after the occurrence of the fracture ; during the whole of that period she had been confined to bed. G-reat difficulty was experienced in keeping the parts in position.—Lawrence Ward, Book, vol. vi, p. 17. 1001. Section through the lower extremities of a Tibia and Fibula. A fracture, firmly united by ossifying fibrous tissue, passes obliquely downwards and in- wards through the lower extremity of the fibula. The external malleolus is displaced outwards about half an inch, and also slightly upwards : a portion of the tibia, separated with the external malleolus, lies between the two bones. The internal malleolus has been broken off and rests on the inner part of the articular surface of the tibia. The foot was displaced outwards, and had carried the fragments of bone with it. From a man, aged 65 years, who died three months after having fractured his leg, by slipping in the street. An ulcer which formed on the heel necessitated the frequent changing of the splints. ° 1002. The lower extremities of the Tibia and Fibula with the Foot of an elderly woman, exhibiting the effects of an injury which occurred several years before death. The foot is displaced outwards, so that only the inner half of the articular surface of the astragalus is in apposition with the tibia. There has been a comminuted fracture, extending in various directions through the lower end of the fibula and the adjacent margin of the tibia. The separated portions of bone have been completely re-united. c iqj (In Case H.)INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 144 1003. A Foot, with, parts of the Tibia and Fibula, exhibiting the effects of dis- location and fracture ten months before death. The foot is dislocated outwards. The tibia is partially separated from the fibula: the internal malleolus projects an inch on the inner side of the astragalus. The astragalus also is partially separated from the scaphoid bone. The fibula has been broken into several portions just above the malleolus. These portions are firmly united, and there is an accumulation of bone both before and behind the articulation between the tibia and the fibula. C. 69 The patient was a lunatic 40 years old. The dislocation was not reduced till a month after its occurrence, and the patient's restlessness prevented the tibia from being maintained in its proper place : but he finally regained complete use and power of the foot. The case is described by Sir William Lawrence in the Medico-CJdrurgical Transactions, vol. xvii, p. 58. London, 1832. (In Case H.) 1004. Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula, extending into the ankle-joint. The internal lateral ligament is not ruptured, but the portion of tibia to which it is attached has been torn away from the shaft of the bone. From a man, aged 42. The injury was produced by direct violence. (In Case H.) 1005. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. Fractures extend in several directions, through the shaft and the articular end of the tibia, into the ankle-joint. The fibula also is fractured through the base of the malleolus. C. 88 (In Case H.) 1006. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula. The point of the internal malleolus has been separated by fracture. The fibula is broken two inches above its lower end. C. 39 (In Case H.) 1007. The lower extremities of a Tibia and Fibula. A fracture, which is indi- cated by pieces of glass stuck in the uniting medium, extends through the base of the internal malleolus; it is firmly united by dense fibrous tissue, which, however, admits of slight movement. Another line of fracture extends through the anterior and outer angle of the articular surface of the tibia; there is a considerable amount of new bone about the tibio-fibular articulation. The astragalus was not displaced. The tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum, through the grooves of which the fracture passed, were firmly adherent to their sheaths. From a man who died of delirium tremens seven weeks after having sustained a fracture of the leg, by a box falling on the part. The fibula was fractured about 2| inches above the ankle. —See Kenton Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 47. 1008. The lower extremities of a Tibia and Fibula. A recent fracture extends through the articular surface and cartilage of the tibia. The communication of this fracture with the ankle-joint is closed by a thin layer of lymph firmly adhering to all the parts of the articular cartilage through which the fracture extends. m. 44 1009. Bones of an Ankle-Joint, exhibiting a double fracture of the internal malleolus, separating it from the tibia, and splitting it into two portions. c. 66 (In Case H.)

The Foot of a Child, exhibiting a partial dislocation of the astragalus from the os calcis, together with a fracture of the supei'ior and anterior margin of the latter bone. c. 90145 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). The leg was amputated in consequence of other injuries received, together with this, in the passage of a carriage-wheel over the leg and foot. (In Case H.) 1011. A Comminuted Fracture of the Os Calcis. c. 126 (In Case H.) 1012. An Os Calcis, fractured transversely through its posterior part. The plane of the fracture extends from the posterior border of the upper articular surface to the middle of the posterior surface of the tuberosity. in. 9 The patient fell from a height, but did not strike his heel; and it appeared certain that the fracture of the os calcis was produced by the action of the muscles of the leg. He died of other injuries received in the fall. FRACTUEES OF CARTILAGES. 1013. Section of a Rib with its cartilage. The rib had been separated from the cartilage, but has re-united to it. The union is effected by an abundant deposit of osseous substance, apparently in the texture of the periosteum and peri- chondrium, and in the contiguous cellular tissue around and for some way above and below the line of separation. ni> 82 1014. Portions of Costal Cartilages. There has been a fracture of the cartilage of one of the false ribs. Its portions overlap, and are firmly united by a wed^e- shaped ring of bone extending around them.

Sections of the Cartilage of a Rib, which appears to have been fractured and re-umted by fibrocartilaginous substance placed in the angles between the ends oi its overlapping portions. In 4 1.SERIES IV INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, &c* DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. OF THE STERNAL END. 1017. Portion of a Clavicle, with the upper piece of the Sternum and the First Rib, from an adult. The sternal end of the clavicle is dislocated downwards and forwards. The capsule of its articulation with the sternum is torn ; but the costo-clavicular ligament is entire. The first rib is separated from its cartilage. in. 97 OF THE ACROMIAL END. 1018. A dislocation upwards of the Acromial End of the Clavicle, with fracture of the Shaft. The ligamentous connections between the clavicle and acromion are almost completely torn through. There is a transverse fracture at the junction of the inner with the outer two-thirds of the clavicle, but the periosteum covering the superior and inner surfaces of the bone is intact. From a man aged 35 years, who fell from a scaffold 15 feet high. The acromial end of the clavicle projected upwards, and there was so much separation that a finger could be inserted between it and the acromion. Death took place from injuries to the head.—See Harley Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 15. DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. STJB-CORACOID. 1019. Dissection of a recently dislocated Shoulder-Joint, which was reduced during life. The deltoid muscle is cut across and reBected; the lower part of the muscle was bruised and separated from the bone to a slight extent. The subscapulars is cut across about one inch from its insertion; its under surface at this point was slightly bruised. Neither this muscle nor the supra-spinatus or infra-spinatus was lacerated. The capsule of the joint was untorn; a small extent of its anterior attachment, with the periosteum with which it was continuous, was detached from the margin of the glenoid cavity and adjacent bone, but the joint was not opened. The capsule has been cut across at its anterior attachment. There is a deep vertical indentation or groove at the posterior margin of the articular surface of the head of the humerus, into which the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity accurately fits. It appears to * For Dislocation of the Spine see the following series, p. 170.V '> ViNJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. \ ,V 147 (In Case II.) have been produced by the violent impact of the bead against this prominent rim, on which it probably lodged. From a man, aged 36 years, who was knocked down by a train whilst at work on the line. On admission he was found to have a sub-coraeoid dislocation of the right shoulder, in addition to numerous other injuries, from which he died about twelve hours after the accident. The head of the right humerus could be distinctly felt beneath the coracoid process ; the axis of the bone was directed considerably outwards and backwards. Reduction was effected extremely easily on slight traction being made in the usual manner.—See Colston Ward Book, vol. v, P: 416. The case is described by Mr. Eve, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. lxiii, 1880, p. 317. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 55. 1020. A right Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an unreduced sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus of long standing. The head of the humerus, with a great part of its cartilage removed, and its articular surface hardened, rests on the antei'ior surface of the scapula, with a thick layer of fibrous tissue intervening between it and the latter bone. It is directly below, and nearly in contact with, the the coracoid process, just on the inner side of the glenoid cavity, but not below its level: the axillary artery and brachial plexus of nerves are close to it on its anterior and inner aspect. The infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapnlaris muscles are shown retaining; their natural connections with the head of the humerus. A part of the capsule also is shown. The glenoid cavity retains its natural forcn, but its articular cartilage is thin and has numerous shreds, appa- rently of fibrous tissue, upon it. in. 112 The body was brought to the dissecting rooms, and no history could be obtained. Specimen No. 1051 was taken from the same body. A drawing is preserved, No. 56; and a cast, No. 37. 1021. A Shoulder-Joint with the shaft of the Humerus, exhibiting dislocation and fracture. The head of the humerus is thrown forwards beneath the coracoid process. The tendons of the long head of the biceps, of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are entire. There have been two fractures in the shaft of the bone, and they are both firmly united. in. 47 The injury consisted, in the first instance, of the dislocation and a single fracture. No at tempt was made to reduce the dislocation, and when the fracture had united, the patient fell down, and sustained the second fracture. 1022. A Shoulder-Joint, in which a dislocation of the Humerus occurred long before death, and was not reduced. The head of the humerus rested on the anterior surface of the scapula, and on the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity, just below the coracoid process. Tough ligamentous tissue has been formed on the scapula, beneath the head of the humerus, and a new fibrous capsule surrounded it. The surface of the glenoid cavity is covered by similar fibrous tissue, and that part of the head of the humerus which was in contact with its anterior margin has been absorbed. The tendons of the biceps, supra- spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis muscles are all shown retaining their proper attachments. m. 118 1023. A Scapula and Humerus. The bead of the humerus appears to have been dislocated forwards, and to have remained long unreduced just beneath the coracoid process, on the anterior surface and neck of the scapula. A concave surface has been here formed, on which the head of the humerus rested. The pressure of the posterior part of the head of the humerus against the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity, has caused them both to be partially absorbed; and the remaining edge of the glenoid cavity, fitting in the recess in the bead of the humerus, forms a kind of new joint between them. c. 27148 INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 1024. A Scapula and a portion of a Humerus, exhibiting the same con- sequences of dislocation of the head of the humerus as are shown in 1023. . C. o4* (In Case H.) SUB-CLAVICULAR. 1025. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting a sub-clavicular dislocation of the humerus, which occurred eighteen months before death. The head of the humerus rests on the anterior surface of the scapula, near the inferior border. The tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapular is muscles are entire. A bristle is passed beneath the tendon of the sub-scapularis, close to its insertion. A bristle is also passed beneath the tendon of the long head of the biceps, which retains its attachment to the edge of the glenoid cavity. Two bristles are passed beneath the circumflex nerve, which has been com- pressed by the dislocated head of the humerus, and is, in consequence, flattened and firmly adherent to the capsule of the joint. nI- 42 The dislocation was followed by permanent paralysis of the deltoid muscle. SUB-SPINOUS. 1026. A Shoulder-Joint, exhibiting an incomplete dislocation of the Humerus back- wards. The head of the humerus, unaltered in form, rests against the posterior border of the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the supra-spinatus and infra- spinatus muscles are detached from the tuberosity of the humerus, but retain their connection with the capsule. The tendon of the biceps is displaced from its groove in the humerus, but retains its attachment to the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the teres minor and sub-scapularis retain their attachments to the humerus. The capsule of the joint is thickened. nr. 53 1027. A Humerus and Scapula, exhibiting dislocation which occurred a consider- able time before death. The head of the humerus was displaced upwards and backwards upon the dorsum of the scapula. Its anterior margin rested against the inferior surface and the outer edge of the spine of the scapula, in which situa- tion a hollow and partially polished surface has been formed in adaptation to it. The neck of the humerus having moved upon and across the inferior half of the glenoid cavity and the adjacent part of the lower border of the scapula, their opposite surfaces are here accurately adapted and highly polished : the surface of the scapula at this part is broad and convex, while that of the humerus is deeply hollowed out. The lower part of the glenoid cavity has disappeared, being comprised in the new joint formed with the neck of the humerus. The head of the humerus is altered in its form by the irregular deposit of bone on its surface : the upper half of the glenoid cavity is also flattened and nodulated. A fracture through the middle of the shaft of the humerus has been firmly united, but with an angle directed outwards. c- '9 For a cast of this shoulder, before the removal of the soft parts, see No. 39. (In Case H.) DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. RADIUS AND ULNA BACKWARDS. 1028. An Elbow-Joint, exhibiting a dislocation of the Eadius and Ulna backwards, which occurred a considerable time before death. The articular surface of the humerus was completely covered by a newly-formed capsule, the cavity of which is laid open in front. The head of the radius and the articular surface of the ulna are also inclosed in new capsules, separated from each other and from that which incloses the articular end of the humerus. The sigmoid cavityINJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 149 of the ulna appears to rest on a prominence of bone, extending from the pos- terior surface of the trochlea of the humerus. The head of the radius is con- fined in the place which it now occupies by a thick fibrous cord, extending from its upper surface to a process of bone connected with the margin of the humerus just above the outer condyle. I1L 33 1029. An old dislocation of the Elbow-Joint. The radius and ulna are dislocated backwards and slightly outwards: they are bound firmly to the humerus by a large amount of fibrous tissue, which, however, permits slight movement of the bones on each other. The articular surfaces are completely absorbed and covered by fibrous tissue. The outer part of the articular surface of the humerus is extensively absorbed in correspondence with the outward displacement of the bones of the forearm ; possibly a fracture occurred in this situation, as a large mass of bone can be felt in the fibrous tissue over the extremity of the ulna. The upper end of the radius is firmly fixed to the ulna and lies partly on a smooth surface of the humerus, but no rotatory movement is possible. ^ There is a recent extensively comminuted fracture of the radius. The parts were removed by amputation from a man aged 30, whose arm was crushed by a wheel passing over it.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 7. RADIUS FORWARDS. 1030. An Elbow-Joint, in which there has been fracture and dislocation. The radius and ulna are broken about two inches below the joint: and their frac- tured ends, not having united by bone, are connected by new capsules which have formed around them. The head of the radius is dislocated upwards and forwards in front of the humerus. ill. 5 1031. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint. The articular surfaces of the humerus and ulna are altered in form; that of the humerus, being narrower, and that of the ulna, deeper than is natural: but there is no appearance of their having been fractured. The radius was found dislocated from the outer condyle, and lying upon the front of the ulna. C. 37 (In Case H.) 1032. The Bones of an Elbow-Joint, exhibiting the effects of dislocation and fracture, which occurred many years before death, and which were followed by long-continued inflammation of the bones. The head of the radius has been dislocated forwards. The shaft of the ulna has been broken a little below the olecranon. The head of the radius, mis-shapen, elongated, and flattened, appears to have rested and moved obliquely across the front and outer part of the lower end of the shaft of the humerus. A cavity is here formed on the humerus, into which the head of the radius fits; and their opposed surfaces are covered by hard, ivory-like, polished, and perforated bone. The fractured surfaces of the ulna, not uniting, have moved freely upon each other, the upper portion resting in a deep pit on the lower. All the bones are enlarged, and the radius and ulna are united by bone abundantly formed between them and upon their surfaces. c. 77 Presented by Dr. Hooper. (In Case H.) RADIUS BACKWARDS. 1033. An Elbow-Joint, in which the head of the radius was dislocated backwards. No reduction of the dislocated bone having been effected, it has become exten- sively united to the side of the ulna. There appears also to have been a fracture of the internal condyle. All the bones are atrophied. ni. 13150 INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. DISLOCATION OF THE WRIST-JOINT. CARPUS FORWARDS. 1034. A Wrist-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the carpns forwards. The radins is arched with a convexity directed posteriorly near its lower end: but there is no appearance of its having been fractured. HI. 39 DISLOCATION OF THE DIGITS. OF THE THUMB. 1035. A portion of the Left Hand of a man who was killed by the fall of an arch- way. The proximal phalanx of the thumb is dislocated forward on to the anterior surface of the head of the metacarpal bone. The posterior portion of the capsule of the joint is torn across. Reduction was readily effected by exten- sion. DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. BACKWARDS. 1036. Dissection of a recently dislocated left Hip-Joint, which was reduced during life. The gluteus maximus and medius have been removed, the gluteus minimus is partially reflected: neither were injured. The quad- ratus fern oris is cut across, and the pyriformis, gemelli, and obturator in- ternus muscles are reflected outwards ; of these, the pyriformis and superior gemellus were slightly lacerated. The obturator internus is extensively lace- rated (this is partially due to immersion of the specimen and to traction on the muscle) : no other muscles were torn. The posterior part of the rim of the acetabulum, formed by the ischium, is broken off. The ligamentum teres is torn across at its acetabular insertion. The cartilage covering the lower and anterior part of the head of the femur has been irregularly ground off. The torn capsule is seen surrounding the posterior surface of the head of the femur; the rent, which passes along its acetabular attachment, is limited to the portion inserted into the ischial margin of the acetabulum, but does not extend quite as far forward as the cotyloid notch. The ilio-femoral ligament is intact. There were considerable extravasations of blood around the upper part of the femoral vein, between the gluteus medius and minimus, and into the substance of the obturator exteraus. The head of the femur appears, from the dissection and physical signs, to have been thrown on to the body of the ischium on a level with the lower part of the great ischiatic notch. From a man, aged 55 years. Whilst at work excavating, a fall of earth took place upon him. He was admitted to the hospital with a sciatic dislocation of the left hip. Reduction was readily effected by traction on the thigh in a position of slight flexion and adduction, the manipula- tion of flexion and circumduction having failed. Symptoms of peritonitis came on and he died on the following day. The post mortem examination revealed intense general peritonitis occa- sioned by the rupture of a portion of the intestine, which at the time of the accident lay appa- rently in the right inguinal canal.—See Pitcaim Ward Book, vol. v, p. 377. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 57. 1037. A Hip-Joint, in which a dislocation of the Femur occurred a week before death. The capsule has been opened in front to show the head of the femur, which is deprived of many large portions of its cartilage, some of which are seen loosely connected with the neck of the bone. At the back part of the joint is the wide laceration in the capsule which was made by the head of the femur in its dislocation from the acetabulum. It was supposed that the dislo- cated head of the femur was situated upon the ischium, close to its spine. AINJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 151 portion of the posterior part of the rim of the acetabulum, m the presumed direction of the dislocation, is separated by fracture. Upon the front part ot tlu- joint there is also a detached portion of the rim of the acetabulum connected with the capsule. The surface of this piece of bone is very smooth, and is adapted to a corresponding surface of the ilium immediately below the anterior inferior spine; and above this surface there is a deposit of bone, making it probable that the changes in this part of the joint were the result of some injury previous to the dislocation. m- D° 1038. A Dislocation of the Right Hip. The head of the femur is seen lying on the body of the ischium and ischial margin of the acetabulum, on a level with the lesser ischiatic notch. The sciatic nerve passes over the head of the bone, which is bound down by the obturator internus: the tendon of this muscle passes across the horizontal diameter of the head. The gemellus inferior is torn across; this is the only muscle which is torn or lacerated. The gemellus superior is absent. The whole of that portion of the margin of the acetabulum which is formed by the ischium is broken off and pushed above the head of the femur. The pyriformis muscle is raised up and put on the stretch by this fragment of bone. The rough fractured surface of the ischium is partly covered by the head of the femur and partly exposed to view. The qnadratus femoris is reflected, exposing the obturator externus, which tightly embraces the posterior and lower surfaces of the neck of the femur. A small extent of the lower and back part of the capsule is torn across: the upper and back part is intact and attached to the uptorn margin of the acetabulum: the inferior portion covering the cotyloid notch is also nntorn. The ilio-femoral ligament and the upper part of the capsule are intact; the former presents an oval opening through which the bursa under the psoas communicated with the joint. The specimen was taken from a middle-aged man who was brought into the hospital dead. He threw himself out of a window and fractured the base of his skull, besides dislocating his femur. The right leg was somewhat longer than the left: the thigh was adducted and rotated inwards: the knee was slightly flexed and rested on the lower third of the left thigh; the right great toe rested on the ball of the left great toe. This case, and the case from which specimen No. 1036 were taken, are described by Mr. Eve in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. lxiii, 1880, p. 51. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 58. 1039. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a direct dislocation of the head of the Femur downwards and backwards, which occurred twelve hours before death. The head of the bone is situated on the ischium, opposite to the lesser ischiatic notch and the upper part of the tuberosity. The tendon of the obturator in- ternus is torn from its muscular fibres ; some of the fibres of the pyriformis, gemelli, and gluteus minimus are also torn. The inferior portion of the capsule is intact. A fracture passes through the junction of the pubis with the ilium, the anterior margin of the acetabulum and the ischium in front of the tube- rosity. From the situation of the rent in the capsule, it is evident that the dislocation occurred directly backwards, below the tendon of the obturator internus. in. 56 The patient was a maniac, who leaped from a third story window. He died of other injuries received at the same time. The case is published by Mr. Worruald in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xix, p. 657. London, 1837. 1040. A Hip-Joint, in which a dislocation of the head of the Femur upon the ischiatic notch occurred about three weeks before death. The ligameutum teres has been torn across its middle; no union of it has taken place. The cartilage covering the head of the bone is in part absorbed. The opening in the capsule through which the head of the bone escaped was situated at the posterior part of the joint. Slight union had taken place about the middle of the rent. ThoINJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 152 dislocation has been reproduced. A large portion of bone comprising- the posterior third of the acetabulum is raised above the head : it is attached to the upper part of the capsule. m. 20 1041. Section of the head and neck of a Femur, with the Os Innominatum of a man in whom dislocation of the femur and fracture of the acetabulum occurred fifty years before death. The dislocation was reduced; but, soon after, the head of the bone again escaped from the acetabulum, and was not again reduced. The head and neck of the femur are altered in form, being shortened, flattened, and much increased in their vertical diameter; and the cancellous tissue of a thick layer of the head of the femur is consolidated and hard. A new and deep osseous cavity, with very thick walls, projects from the os inno- minatum, as if growing out from the original acetabulum, and incloses the head and a part of the neck of the femur. The wall of bone by which this cavity is separated from that of the pelvis, and which includes the former floor of the acetabulum, is an inch and a quarter m thickness, and is chiefly formed, like the rest of the walls of the cavity, of hard compact new bone. The surface of the cavity and that of the head of the femur are covered and partially connected by fibrous tissue : they have no articular cartilage. The obturator internus muscle and sciatic nerve are seen in their natural situations, but are flattened in consequence of the altered form and enlargement of the surrounding parts. ra. 100 The patient was 18 years old at the time of the dislocation. His limb was a little shortened, but he had good use of it. 1042. The other half of the Hip-Joint described above, after maceration. in. 101 Presented by Thcnias Wormald, Esq. DOWNWARDS INTO THE OBTURATOR FORAMEN. 1043. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting a recent dislocation of the head of the Femur onto the lower edge of the obturator externus muscle. The ligamentum teres is torn from its attachment to the head of the femur. The capsule is extensively lacerated at the anterior and lower part of the joint. The obturator externus muscle is lacerated where the femur rests partly on it, and partly on the subjacent obturator ligament. m, 25 FORWARDS AND UPWARDS. 1044. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting an infra-spinous dislocation of the Femur which occurred many years before death. The head of the femur has been thrown upwards and forwards, and is lodged in a cavity on the outer surface of the anterior inferior spine : this cavity is formed partly by new bone, and partly by the displaced cotyloid ligament. The ligamentum teres is flattened and elongated, but it retains its natural connections ; bristles are passed beneath the two portions of this ligament, which are attached to the margin of the original acetabulum. The lower part of the head of the femur is irregularly absorbed. in. 43 The patient was 40 years old. When he was about 14 years old, he fell from a ladder and injured his hip. He had great pain at the time of the accident, and fur many mouths much difficulty in walking ; but he recovered, and was in an active walking occupation till his last illness. The case is recorded by Mr. Wormald, in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xix, p. 658. London, 1837. 1045. The left Hip-Joint of a man aged 46, showing an infra-spinous dislocation. The head of the femur has left the acetabulum, and is lodged beneath the anterior inferior iliac spine, the great trochanter pointing directly backwards. The tendon of the psoas muscle winds l-ound the outer aspect of the head to reach the lesser trochanter. The iliacus muscle is stretched over the inner153 INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. portion of the head, and between the two muscles lies the anterior crural nerve. The femoral vessels lie to the inner side of the head of the bone. The hip had been injured by a fall from a haystack four years previously. Symptoms of disease of the hip appeared two years subsequently. He was confined to bed for some weeks before death occurred. REPARATIVE CHANGES AFTER REDUCTION. 1046. A left Hip-Joint; also the head of the Femur, and part of the acetabulum from the opposite joint, taken from a man who sustained a dislocation of the femur on the dorsum of the ilium, three years before death. The dislocation was soon reduced, and the only toaces of its effects which remain are, that there is a strong band or collar of ligamentous tissue around the base of the neck of the femur at its upper part, and that a slip of the ligamentum teres is attached to the notch of the acetabulum, external to the cotyloid ligament. But with this exception, the ligamentum teres presents no sign of having been The following specimens of Dislocation are presumed to have been due to elongation of the capsule, but were possibly in some instances congenital. 1047. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting elongation of the capsule and of the ligamentum teres. The ligamentum teres has separated through its whole length into three cords. The internal surface of the capsule is beset by small pedunculated filamentous growths. The elongation of the capsule has allowed the head of the femur to pass to a considerable distance from the acetabulum, which is contracted to a small triangular cavity. II. 54 An engraving of the specimen is published, with a paper by Mr. Stanley, " On Dislocations accompanied by Elongation of the Ligaments," in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxiv, PI. IV, fig. 2. London, 1841. Presented by W. J. Ward, Esq. 1048. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the head of the Femur with elonga- tion of the capsule. The capsule is entire, and measures, now that it is laid open, between four and five inches in length. The cavity of the acetabulum has almost disappeared, being both reduced in size and filled by fibrous tissue. The ligamentum teres is absent, and the head of the femur is small, and its articular surface irregular. The capsule around the neck of the femur presents a fringe of slender growths. m< £4 This specimen and the preceding closely resemble No. 1050. The specimen is figured in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxiv, PI. IV, fig. 1 London, 1841 : in illustration of a paper by Mr. Stanley, " On Dislocations, accompanied by Elongations of the Ligaments." 1049. A Hip-Joint, exhibiting dislocation of the head of the Femur on the dorsum of the ilium, which occurred a considerable time before death. On one side of the preparation is a part of the original capsule ; this has been exten- sively divided in front, to show the acetabulum, which is contracted into a narrow triangular cavity nearly filled by fibrous tissue. On the other side of the preparation, the head of the bone is shown, deformed, reduced in size, and surrounded by a thick membrane of tough fibrous tissue, which is smooth on its internal surface. This membrane, forming the capsule of the new joint is m part newly formed, and in part consists of the remains of the former capsule • it is extensively divided behind, to give a distinct view of the head of the bone' The cavity of the new capsule communicates with that of the old capsule below the neck of the femur, and their smooth internal linings are continuous. in. 31INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 154 CONGENITAL DISLOCATION. 1050. The Pelvis and Femora of an adult female. The head of each femur is dislocated upon the dorsum of the ilium. Portions of the capsules of the hip- joints remain, but there is no vestige of either ligamentum teres. There has been absorption of the surface of the head of each femur, diminishing its size, and giving it an irregular conical form. On the dorsum of each ilium there is an oblong roughened patch, produced by friction of the heads of the thigh- bones in walking. The acetabula are represented by two small triangular cavities. There is considerable lordosis of the spine. b. 48 The dislocations were probably congenital, but the history of the case is not known. (In Case II.) DISLOCATION OF THE PATELLA. OUTWARDS. 1051. A Knee-Joint, of which the patella was dislocated outwards long before death, and was not reduced. The patella rests on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur, on which, in adaptation to it, a small articular surface has been formed by a layer of very dense and polished ligamentous tissue. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris lies on the outer side of the femur, and the ligamentum patellae is directed slightly inwards as well as downwards towards the tibia, which has been rotated outwards, following the displacement of the patella. All the articular cartilages have been more or less deeply removed: the surfaces of the bones are in several places exposed, hard, and polished, and their margins are nodulated. in. HI A cast of the specimen is preserved, No. 49. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ASTRAGALUS. 1052. An Astragalus, which had been dislocated forwards, upwards, and a little outwards, with compound fracture of the external malleolus, and displacement of the foot inwards. It was excised on the tenth day after the accident. in. 131 The limb was proceeding favoiorably, the wound being nearly closed, when the patient, aged 61, died of delirium tremens on the thirtieth day. 1053. A Dislocated Astragalus, which was removed by operation ten days after the accident. m- 121 The astragalus was dislocated forwards and outwards from the tibia, and its connections with tlie tarsus were also severed : the foot was displaced inwards. There was no fracture of the fibula. The dislocation, which was a compound one, was reduced ; but extensive suppura- tion followed, and the astragalus, becoming again displaced, and presenting itself at an external wound, was removed. Subsequently, a considerable portion of the ligaments connected with it sloughed ; but, a month after the injury, the case was making favourable progress. Vide No. 1010, Series III.

The other half of the sternum and the oesophagus are in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England. Presented by Joseph Swan, Esq. 1058. The upper portion of a Sternum. The manubrium is separated from the gladiolus and displaced backwards, the extremity of the latter projecting for- wards. The injury was caused by the fall of a bale of linen from a height of forty feet upon the head and shoulders of a man. He also sustained a fracture of the spine in the upper dorsal region, which caused his death ten days after the accident.—See Ahernethy Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 229. VSEKIES V. DISEASES AND DEFOKMITIES OF THE SPINE. CARIES (ULCERATION) OF THE VERTEBRA. 1059. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration of the posterior surfaces of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae, from the second to the fifth, and more super- ficial ulceration of their anterior surfaces, with deposits of new bone. IV. 24 1060. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting ulceration of the arches of the vertebrae. The left halves of the arches of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae are almost completely destroyed. A portion of the ulcerated bone became sepa- rated, and pressed upon the spinal cord. The remaining portions of the bones are of their natural texture. IV- 22 1061. Section of a Child's Spine, from the second cervical to the third dorsal vertebra. The whole of the body of the fifth and part of that of the sixth vertebra are, together with the intervening fibro-cartilage, destroyed by ulcera- tion. The body of the fourth, and the remains of that of the sixth vertebra, are solidified, hard, and yellow. A collection of purulent fluid existed between the diseased vertebrae and their periosteum, both in front of the bodies and behind them, and part of it was discharged by ulceration into the spinal canal. iv. 42 1062. Section of a Spine, in which the adjacent parts of the bodies of two dorsal vertebrae are infiltrated with inflammatory materials, and deeply ulce- rated. A portion of the diseased bone has been separated and protruded for- wards. The intervertebral substance between the two diseased vertebrae is completely absorbed. An abscess has formed by the side of the diseased portion of the spine, but it has no communication with the ulcerated bone. iv. 21 1063. Section of a Spine, including four lower dorsal Vertebrae. The interver- tebral substance and the adjacent parts of the bodies of two of the vertebrae are destroyed by ulceration, and the bone bordering the ulcerated surfaces is con- solidated and hard. Between two other vertebrae a circumscribed cavity is formed, like that of a small abscess, by the removal of the central part of the intervertebral substance, and of adjacent portions of the bodies of the vertebrae. Again, between two others, a small cavity is formed by the removal of a portion of the'intervertebral substance, and of the surface of one vertebra. It may be assumed that in this case disease commenced in the intervertebral substance, and from thence extended to the substance of the vertebrae; thence also^ it has extended to their anterior surfaces, which are extensively ulcerated, with separation of their periosteum. iv- 45DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. 157 1064. Section of a Spine from the fifth dorsal to the second lumbar vertebra, exhibiting the effects of tubercular disease in the bodies of the vertebras. In the bodyof nearly every vertebra there are one or more small, spherical, and exactly circumscribed cavities, which were filled with pus, or with a mixture of pus and tubercular matter. The cavities measure from one-eighth to one-half of an inch in diameter, and are nearly all lined with a thin layer of false membrane ; the bone around them is healthy, or in some parts slightly consoli- dated. The ligament between the bodies of the tenth and eleventh dorsal vertebras is softened and in great part removed, as if by ulceration. The adjoining parts of the bodies of the same vertebrae are also ulcerated, and by the approximation of their anterior borders have produced a slight angular cur- vature of the spine: the parts of these vertebrae adjacent to the ulceration are solid, hard, and yellow. Most of the vertebras also are ulcerated on their anterior surfaces, and their periosteum is raised from these parts by the collec- tion of purulent matter beneath it. iv. 43 1065. Part of the other section of the same Spine after maceration. It shows more clearly the generally light and dry texture of the vertebra?, and the con- solidation of a very thin layer of the cancellous tissue around the cavities. Here, also, many cavities are shown at and near the exterior of the vertebras. iv. 44 The patient was a labourer, 26 years old. Weakness and pain in the back had disabled him from work for eight months. Slight angular curvature of the spine existed in its lower dorsal region, and here it was painful on pressure, and during movements of the body. No paralysis existed. Through exposure to cold, acute pleuro-pneumonia ensued while he was under treatment, and proved quickly fatal. 1066. Section of a Spine, exhibiting rarefactive ostitis of the bodies of three lumbar vertebras, with caries of the posterior part of the body of the lower. All the other vertebras of this spine were similarly altered. iv. 18 1067. Section of a Spine, in which the bodies of two of the lower dorsal vertebras are nearly destroyed by ulceration. Their remains are soft and crumbling, and the intervertebral substance is removed. There is a deposit of caseous matter around the diseased bone, elevating the periosteum of the bodies of the vertebras and the pleura costalis to a considerable extent above and below the chief seat of the disease. jy. 16 1068. Five Dorsal Vertebras, exhibiting superficial ulceration on the anterior surfaces of their bodies : the ulceration was connected with psoas abscess. A. 80 (In Case C.) 1069. Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebras are almost completely destroyed by ulceration. The anterior surface of the bodies of three contiguous vertebras is also carious. The diseased bone is rough and uneven, but retains its natural hardness. There is no angular curvature. D 24 (In CaseC.) 1070. Portion of a Spine, exhibiting Caries with abscess in the cancellous texture of the body of one of the vertebras. There is a considerable deposit of new bone upon the vertebras around the diseased bone. Between two of the bodies the fibro-cartilage has been removed, and they are united by bono.

The dorsal and lumbar portions of a Spine, from a young person, exhibiting a nearly complete destruction of the intervertebral ligaments in the whole extent of the column, with ulceration of the bodies of the vertebrae. The bodies of several of the lumbar vertebras are completely destroyed, and an angle is here formed by the approximation of the upper and lower parts of the column and the projection of the spinous processes. In the dorsal vertebras the ulceration is superficial, though the intervertebral ligaments are very deeply destroyed. The bone in progress of ulceration is not softened or otherwise changed in its apparent texture. iv. 31 1072.

OSSEOUS ANCHYLOSIS OP, AND FORMATION OF NEW BONE ON, THE VERTEBRA. 1073. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the Atlas. The atlas is united to the occipital bone by new bone formed abundantly around their articulations. The atlas is also displaced towards the left side, and its right half projecting within the foramen magnum considerably diminishes the size of the aperture. iv. 27 1074. Portion of an Occipital Bone, with the first and second Cervical Vertebrae. There is a nearly complete osseous union of the two vertebras, and the odontoid process appears to have been superficially ulcerated. The anterior arch of the atlas exhibits a line of fracture; but it does not appear probable that the anchylosis of the vertebras was the consequence of the fracture. iv. 33 1075. Portion of au Occipital Bone, with the three uppermost Cervical Vertebras. The occipital bone and the anterior half of the atlas are firmly and completely united by bone. The second and third vertebras are similarly anchylosed at their articular processes. These changes seem to have followed ulcerative disease, by which the odontoid process and the body of the second vertebra were changed in structure, and in part removed. IV- 26 1076 The base of a Skull, with the first Cervical Vertebra. The vertebra, dis- placed forwards and to the left side, is in every part, except the right half of its posterior arch, united to the occipital bone.

Section of the upper part of the Spine, of the Occipital Bone, and of the Spinal Cord. The connections of the second cervical vertebra, with the first, and with the occipital bone, having been destroyed, apparently by ulceration, the anterior portion of the first vertebra, and the basilar portion of the occipital bone have sunk down, so that the lower margin of the first vertebra is within a line of the upper margin of the intervertebral substance between the second and the third ; and the whole of the odontoid process of the second projects straight upwards into the cavity of the skull. The medulla oblongata is thus lifted up and stretched over the apex of the odontoid process ; and, as the pons holds its connection with the basilar portion of the occipital bone, the axis of the medulla oblongata forms a right angle with the axis of the spinal cord. The displaced bones are held together by the thickened and consolidated adjacent tissues. Their texture appears indurated, but not otherwise diseased. iv. 38 The patient was a woman 32 years old. The most prominent sign of the disease, which was of four years' duration, was a constant acute pain at the hack of the neck, just helow the occiput. She had some difficulty of swallowing, and used to sit with her chin on her hand, or resting on her sternum. But she suffered no loss of sensation, and was able to walk on the day before her death. Some of the dorsal vertebrae were also affected with caries. Presented by John Avery, Esq. 1093. The Upper portion of the Cervical Spine. The atlas is displaced forwards and to the left side, and is firmly anchylosed to the axis. By the displacement of the atlas the spinal canal is much narrowed and converted into an elongated fissure. The odontoid process and body of the axis have been partially destroyed. IV- 38a The displacement was probably the result of carious disease. The history of the case is not known. 1094.

The upper half of a Spine, in which the bodies of the fifth and sixth cervieal vertebra are completely,and those of the fourth and seventh partially, destroyed by ulceration. The intervertebral fibro-cartilages between these vertebrae, as w ell as those between the first four dorsal vertebra3, are completely destroyed, and the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae are superficially ulcerated. There is an angular curvature in the lower part of the cervical region, and the remains of one of the bodies of the vertebra? project far into the spinal canal. iv. 34 From a child 10 years old. There was a large collection of matter in front of the spine pressing the pleura; inwards. Presented by J. G\ Perry, Esq. 1096. Section of a Spine, exhibiting the process of reparation after extensive disease. Twelve spinous processes are shown in the preparation, but the bodies of only four vertebra?; eight bodies, therefore, have been destroyed. The vertebra? above and below these eight have been approximated, and are firmly united by bone with their remains and with one another. An extremely acute angular curvature is thus produced, but the spinal cord having adapted itself to the alteration in the direction of the spinal canal, has not been compressed. iv. 23 1097. Section of a Spine, with Angular Curvature. The disease is situated in the middle of the dorsal region; large portions of the bodies of two vertebra? have been destroyed by caries. A soft caseous matter is deposited around the diseased bone, and is so abundant in front and at the side of the spine, that it elevates the periosteum of the vertebra? and the pleura costalis in the form of a tumour within the chest. A small piece of bone is separated from the rest by necrosis, and is imbedded in the caseous matter behind the carious vertebra?. The spinal cord for the space of an inch and a half, is compressed in the situa- tion of the curvature. iv. 14- The patient was under the care of Mr. Pott, and had paraplegia and other signs of " Pott's disease " of the spine and spinal cord. It was one of the first cases which showed the benefit of issues in the treatment of the disease; for under their influence the paraplegia and other symptoms were completely removed, and the patient recovered so as to walk with ease. He died with phthisis. 1098. Part of the dorsal portion of a Spine. The anterior half of the body of the seventh dorsal vertebra is almost entirely destroyed by ulceration, and the body of the sixth is deeply ulcerated on its anterior surface. By the approxi- mation and union of the sixth and eighth vertebra?, an angular curvature of the spine has been produced. A small rough process of bone has grown from the most prominent part of the angle into the spinal canal. Opposite to this pro- jection the spinal cord was softened and reduced in size—See Series XXXI Xo. 2544. IV. ^ 1099. Portion of the Spine of a Child, exhibiting the process of cure after caries. The bodies of four of the lower dorsal vertebras are completely destroyed; and the anterior parts of the bodies of the vertebra? which were immediately above and below the situation of the disease, are approximated and firmly united by bone. Together with the angular curvature thus produced, there is some lateral displacement of the bodies of the vertebra?; but, by the separation of the arches of the diseased vertebras, the spinal canal, though changed in form, appears to have retained its natural size. Iy u 1100. Section of a Spine, exhibiting disease in three of the bodies of the lower dorsal vertebra?, which was in progress towards its cure. A large portion of the^ anterior and lower half of the body of one vertebra has been destroyed by caries. The intervertebral substances above and below it have also been removed . M102 DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. The adjacent vertebra) are approximated, so that their anterior margins are nearly in contact and partially united by bone, and there is considerable angular curvature of the spine. The remains of the body of the vertebra which is principally diseased, and the bodies of the vertebras above and below it, are denser and harder than natural, and of a yellow colour. The spinal cord is curved, in correspondence with the curvature of the spine, but is not com- pressed. The patient was a lad 17 years old. After signs of the disease had existed for two years he had paraplegia. Issues were made near the diseased part of the spine and he ^T^ljmft- cientlv to pSrsue his work as a farmer's boy. But, by a fall on his back, acute inflammation of the spinal cord, apparently extending to the brain, was excited, which proved tatai. 1101. The last nine dorsal, and the first lumbar Vertebrae of a Child. The body of the eleventh dorsal vertebra is nearly destroyed, and those of the eightn, ninth, and tenth are completely destroyed by ulceration. The space lett by their removal is partially closed by the approximation of the vertebra) above and below, producing an acute angular curvature of the spine; it is bounded in front by the periosteum and ligaments of the vertebras detached and raised up over a collection of purulent fluid. The detachment of the# periosteum is also continued over the fronts of the bodies of the seventh, sixth and fifth dorsal vertebras, which are hollowed out, except at their borders, by ulceration ; the intervertebral substances are not diseased. The posterior common vertebral lio-ament is raised and made to project into the spinal canal by purulent and p?obably tuberculous matter collected behind the remains of the ulcerated vertebras. 1102. Section of the lower dorsal and first two lumbar Vertebras. The former, the seat of old disease, have their bodies broken down and crushed together. In this condition they have become consolidated. The spinal canal at, and above the curve, is slightly narrowed. The cord is here compressed, its antero- posterior diameter being less by nearly one-fifth of an inch than immediately above and below. The angular curvature was of slow formation. It occurred between the ages of 8 and 11 years, about 14 years prior to the death of the patient. There was no paralysis. Pneumonia was the immediate cause of death. 1103 Section of a part of a Spine, including the last six dorsal and the first three lumbar vertebras. In consequence of disease—probably such ulceration as is shown in the preceding specimen—there has been a considerable loss of sub- stance in the bodies of the last three dorsal vertebras, and their remains have united at a very acute angle. The osseous substance in this situation is hard and dense The intervertebral cartilage between the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebras is wholly removed, and that between the first and second lumbar vertebras has yielded, so as to leave a deep gap between the bodies of those bones The vertebral canal behind the angular curvature is not narrowed, nor is the spinal cord in any degree compressed, though drawn close over the angle in the front wall of the canal. IY- s® From a lad, who died with lumbar abscess. 1104 Section of a Spine, from the sixth dorsal to the second lumbar vertebra. The anterior parts of the bodies of the ninth and tenth dorsal vertebras, and the portion of the fibro-cartilage between them are destroyed by ulceration; the approximation of their remains has produced an angular curvature of the snine The periosteum, with the anterior vertebral ligament, is detached both from these two and from the eighth and eleventh dorsal vertebras; it was raised over a collection of purulent fluid, which projected in the posterior mediastinum and communicated below with a psoas abscess.

Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of two dorsal vertebrae are com- pletely destroyed by ulceration, and those of two others were in progress of removal. D- ^ (In Case C.) 1106. The Dorsal portion of a Spine, with an acute angular curvature in conse- quence of destruction of the bodies of five vertebra). Together with the angular curvature, there is also lateral displacement, the superior vertebras being united to the left of the inferior. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms two very acute angles; the first, where it turns to the right, in adaptation to the lateral displacement; the second, where it resumes its down- ward course. D. 27 (In Case C.) 1107. The Dorsal portion of a Spine, with acute angular curvature, in conse- quence of destruction of the bodies of three vertebras. The aorta, upon the altered part of the spine, forms a very acute angle, which is directed backwards, in correspondence with the angle of the spine itself. D. 28 (In Case C.) 1108. Portion of a Spine, in which the bodies of four of the lower Dorsal Ver- tebra have been removed by ulceration. The ordinary process of cure has taken place, the vertebras above and below the seat of the disease approximating and uniting. But, together with the angular curvature thus produced, there is a lateral deviation of the axis of the spine, the lumbar vertebras being placed to the left of the lower dorsal. The spinous processes are removed, to show that, notwithstanding the angle of bone projecting into the vertebral canal, the space for the spinal cord is here greater than either above or below. D. 36 an Case C.) 1109. A Spine, with a very acute angular curvature, in consequence of the destruction of the bodies of the lower six Dorsal Vertebras. The vertebras above and below the seat of disease have been firmly united with the remains of the bodies of those that were ulcerated, and with one another. D. 29 (In Case C.) 1110. Section of a Spine, in which there has been destruction by ulceration of the bodies of six of the dorsal and lumbar vertebras. The vertebras above and below the seat of the disease have been approximated and firmly united by bone. There is an acute angular curvature of the spine, but the diameter of the canal which contained the spinal cord is not lessened ; rather-, by the extensive destruction of the bodies of the vertebras, it is increased where the angle is most prominent. D. 11 (In Case C.) 1111. The Skeleton of a Woman. There is a well-marked angular curvature in the dorso-lumbar region. The anterior portion of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebras is absorbed, so as to render the bones wedge- shaped ; the surfaces of these and the adjoining vertebras are covered by irre- gular projections of bone. With the angular curvat ure there is a slight 'lateral inclination to the right, and a slight compensatory curve to the left in the cervico-clorsal region. The long bones, with the exception of the bones of the forearms, are not curved, yet have the appearance of bones which had been affected with rickets. They are short, the articular ends are large and flattened, M 21B4 DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. and the muscular ridges are well marked. The pelvis is slightly compressed antero-posteriorly. (In Case A.) 1112. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents an acute angular ^J?^1* dorsal re-ion, the consequence of the destruction by ulceration of the bodies oi the last nine dorsal and the first lumbar vertebra. Two of the ribs are united by bone to the spine. The pelvis is well formed. (In Case C.) 1113. A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. There has been ulceration of the, bodiesof the lumbar vertebra*, and of the sacrum m its whole extent. Four ot the bodies of the lumbar vertebra, are destroyed and an angle is formed^by the approximation of the vertebra, above and below the situation of_the disease their union by bone is incomplete. The thorax is depressed antenoily, so that a space of only two inches and a half intervenes between the en«£o™^tilage and the ossa pubis, and the false ribs nearly touch the crests of the the ribs arch upwards, and the sternum arches forwards. (In Case C.) For other Specimens, see Nos. 1064 and 1071. LATERAL CTJRVATTJBE. 1114 A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis, from an adult woman. All the dorsal and the first two lumbar vertebrae are comprised in a lateral curve, the convexity of which is directed to the right, and backwards. _ There are slight ™™V™^% curves in the cervical and lower lumbar regions of the spine. The bodies ot the vertebrae and intervertebral spaces are much deeper m the convexity than m the concavity of the curve ; they are also twisted round, so that what were their anterior surf aces are directed outwards, towards the convexity of the curve, thfe outward direction being chiefly observed in those vertebra, which are m the Sle of the curve, while those at each end of it gradually approach nearS to their natural direction. The thorax projects obliquely or ward and to the left, and its sides are flattened. The posterior portions of the right ribs are directed downwards, lying nearly in contact with the vertebra,; and then, abruptly round the vertebra, the ribs are directed forwards and to he left with narrow intercostal spaces. The left ribs crowded together- in the concavity of the curve, are directed almost horizontally first outwards and ?hen straight forwards; only their extreme ends and their cartilages being directed inwards to the sternum. The sternum and anterior walls of the thorax are arched as much as the lateral walls are in their natural state while the lateral walls are as flat as the anterior should be. The cavity of the pelvis is of ordinary size, but its anteroposterior axis, m correspondence with the obliquity of the lumbar vertebra,, is directed obliquely, from before backwards, and from right to left. (In Case C) 1115 A Soine Thorax, and Pelvis. The middle of the dorsal region of the "nine is strongly curved towards the left and backwards and there are com- Sensatfng curves to the right and forwards above and be ow this. The description of the preceding specimen will almost exactly apply to this speci- ™n except that in this the principal curve is directed to the left, m that, to the right; and that in this specimen the thorax is less flattened at its sides. d. 25 (In Case C.) 1116 Skeleton of an aged woman, in which, with curvatures of the spine and an altered form of the chest, there is atrophy of the bones in the right lower limb. The spine has suffered three distinct curves, one to the left in the loins a second to the right implicating the lower dorsal vertebra,, and the third to theDISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. 165 left, extending from tlie middle of the back to the neck. The ribs are distorted in adaptation to the curvatures of the spine. The cavity of the chest is altered in its form and dimensions: its antero-posterior axis is direct, but its sides are flattened. The pelvis is well formed, but slightly oblique. The bones of the right lower limb are considerably smaller in all their dimensions than those of the opposite limb; in partial compensation for their shortness, the posterior part of the os calcis is elongated, and pointed almost straight downwards. A. 152 (In Case A.) 1117. The Spine and Pelvis of a young person. The spine exhibits three slight lateral curves; the first, in the superior dorsal region, is directed to the left; the second, in the middle dorsal region, to the right; and the third, in the inferior dorsal and superior lumbar region, to the "left again. The pelvis is remarkably deformed. The internal surfaces of the ilia are unnaturally concave, and their crests are incurved. The ischia are approximated, so that their spines are only an inch and a quarter, and their tuberosities only half an inch, apart ■ their ascending rami are directed almost vertically and parallel to each other, with a distance of from half to three quarters of an inch between them : they are also bent and project in front of the symphysis pubis. The lower part of the sacrum is abruptly turned forwards, in a horizontal plane. While the inferior aperature of the pelvis is thus narrowed, the superior is of nearly natural dimensions. A section of one of the ilia shows that its texture is light, spongy, and soft. These changes were probably the result of mollifies ossium.' (In Case C.) D' 19 1118. A Spine and Sacrum. The spine presents two lateral curves; one in the dorsal region directed to the right, the other in the inferior dorsal and lumbar region directed to the left. The changes in the form and direction of the vertebrae are similar to those shown in No. 1115, but less in degree. d 21 (In Case C.) 1119. A Spine and Pelvis. The spine presents two lateral curves, like those in the preceding specimen. The pelvis is slightly oblique. D 22 (In Case C.) 1120. A Spine, with portions of the Ribs. The spine presents slight lateral curves m its dorsal region; the superior curve is directed to the right, the interior to he left, and they exactly compensate each other, so that the°lumbar and cervical portions of the spine lie in the same vertical plane.

The dorsal vertebra, are reduced m size antmorly, but their texture is not distinctly altered. Between the nmth and te ^eie* a deposit of new bone. The anteroposterior diameter of ^.f^^SftiSe and the sternum is much curved forwards, but the height and width of the chest are diminished; the ribs anterior to the ^^,nf%B^^i ^ some of the lower intercostal spaces being almost °bllte'at;%^ ribs on both sides seem to have been fractured and reunited. The left halt oi the pelvis is atrophied, every part of the os mnommatum W red*cedm size The head of the left femur is so closely anchylosed to the acetabulum, that they Lem to form one bone. The shaft of the femur, which was turned inwards a a right angle with the trunk, was broken off after death. Its tissue, as well as that of the pelvis and ribs, was soft, light, and fragile. (In Case C.) 1126 A Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. The spine, in its dorsal region, is curved tit'h thePcon 4ity backwards and a little to the right. The thorax projecting very far forwards, is flattened at its sides; its transverse diameter » only five inches; its anteroposterior diameter is eight inches and a half. lhe pelvis is of nearly natural form and size ; but its obliquity is somewhat lessened, aidTits antXposterior diameter is rather diminished, while its transverse diameter is, in an equal degree, increased. (In Case C.) 1127 The Spine of an aged person, which, in its whole extent, is curved with the convexity backwards^ and a little to the right. The bones are all healthy, but light. (In Case C.) 1128. A Spine, which, in the upper part of its dorsal region, is slightly curved to the righted backwards. New bone is formed on the margins ot many of the vertebrae. (In Case C.) MORBID GROWTHS IMPLICATING THE VERTEBR2E. 1129 The Upper Cervical Vertebra of the man from whom No. 2541 in Series XXXI was taken. The bodies of the second and third vertebrae are almost entirely destroyed by a malignant tumour. The loss of substance is somewhat greater on the left than on the right side. 1130. Lower Cervical Vertebra?, with a growth involving the body of the sixth. Everywhere the outer wall of this bone is pushed irregularly before the growth formino- in front a considerable nodulated prominence and behind a less marked and smooth projection. On either side the tumour has made its way through the bony envelope, involving the sixth transverse process, and projecting laterallyDISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. 107 through the fifth and sixth intervertebral foramina. At the last-named points it involves, chiefly on the right side, the nerves which principally form the brachial plexus. The vertebral arteries pass through the lower part of the tumour, and the canal of the right is somewhat narrowed. The spinal cord is compressed by the expansion of the posterior wall of the body of the sixth cervical vertebra, the antero-posterior diameter being lessened chiefly upon the right side. A portion of bone is separated from the remainder of the body to show the extent of encroachment upon the canal. iv. 47 The woman, from whom this preparation was obtained, died with recurrent sarcoma, originating in the uterus, and produced as a secondary formation in the pericardium, lungs, and body of the sixth cervical vertebra. Before death she Buffered from paralysis, especially affecting the right arm and leg. The case is fully described in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. ix, p. 327. 1131. Section of seven Dorsal Vertebras, from a man who died with scirrhous cancer of the breast and other organs. Five of these vertebras are affected with scirrhous cancer. In the first and last two the cancellous tissue is filled, and in great measure displaced by firm, greyish substance, which had exactly the same characters as the cancer of the breast. Of the two middle vertebras nothing remains but fragments, infiltrated with cancerous substance, and enclosed in a cavity which was filled with other detached fragments and softened cancer. The intervertebral substance between these two vertebras is dis- organised, and its remains lie in the cavity with their fragments ; the correspond- ing substances between the vertebras above and below are softened at their centres. iv. 39 The chief indication of this affection of the spine was severe pains, like those of rheumatism, in the lower extremities and loins. The cancerous breast is in Series XLVII, No. 3172. There was also a tumour of the humerus, winch is preserved in Series I, No. 510. 1132. Section of the Lower Dorsal and Upper Lumbar Vertebras, from a man, aged 56. There is considerable atrophy of the osseous tissue, the cancelli of which are occupied by a soft vascular pulp. This, under the microscope, presented numerous cells, possessing all the characters of those of soft cancer. A similar change had taken place in the ribs, the sternum, and the upper half of the iliac bones. A small cancerous tumour was attached to the inner surface of the second bone of the sternum. The duration of his illness was four months. 1133. The other half of the previous specimen, macerated and dried. It shows more plainly the great extent to which the vertebras have been destroyed. 1134. Part of a Sacrum and the lower Lumbar Vertebras. The right ala and a portion of the middle of the sacrum, and also the right side and centre of the body of the last lumbar vertebra, have been, destroyed by a morbid growth. From a man, aged 53 years, who died with a malignant pulsating tumour, springing from the right ilium, which had existed for three years. The tumour was soft and brain-like: it had almost entirely destroyed the iliuin, and had extended to the sacrum and spine. INJURIES OF THE SPINE. FRACTURE. 1135. Portion of a Spine, in which the right half of the posterior arch of the atlas has been completely detached by fracture. IV, 7DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. 168 1136. Fracture of the Odontoid Process, taken from a man, aged 20 years, who was struck down by a packing case, which fell from a crane on to his head. Immediately after the injury there was complete paralysis of the trunk and extremities, and the breathing was entirely diaphragmatic. He survived the injury two hours and a half. It will be observed that the fracture passes through the weakest part of the base of the odontoid process, beginning posteriorly at the point at which the nutrient artery enters the bone, and termi- nating at the point of greatest concavity on the anterior surface of the body of the vertebra.—See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xiii, p. 237. 1137. First and second Cervical Vertebras, with part of an Occipital Bone. The odontoid process of the axis, softened and ulcerated, is fractured across its base, just below the level of the transverse ligament. The latter, as well as the other adjacent structures, retain a natural appearance. IV- 46 From a woman, aged 36 years, who had enjoyed good health until ahout four months prior to her death. She then began to complain of obscure pains about the back of the neck, which persisted. In moving about she carried her head stiffly, and always expressed a dread ot moving it suddenly. One morning, whilst stooping over a tub peeling potatoes, her head fell forwards, and she was seen to drop. When picked up, a few seconds later, she was dead.— Vide also Nos. 1094, 1153. 1138. Portion of a Spine, with oblique fractures through the arches of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebras, and a vertical fracture through the body of the fifth. d. 2 (In Cafe C.) 1139. Section of a Spine, in which there is a fracture of the body of the sixth cervical vertebra. The middle and fore part of the body is crushed between the two adjacent vertebras, and its posterior part is pressed backwards into the spinal canal, so that the spinal cord must have been nearly divided. The spinous process of the vertebra retains its natural position. rv. 4 Presented by Henry Earle, Esq. 1140. A portion of the Spinal Column and Cord, including parts of the Cervical and Dorsal Regions. The body of the fourth cervical vertebra is crushed and driven backwards, causing an angular projection, by which the cord is com- pressed. The anterior portions of the vertebras above and below are approxi- mated. From a boy, aged 15 years, who was admitted into the Hospital with complete paraplegia from the shoulders downwards, except that he could slightly move the scapula, and could expel urine and retain fasces. Eespiration was almost entirely diaphragmatic. Six months previously he fell off a scaffold, fifty-five feet high, and struck his neck, but was not stunned. He was taken to the London Hospital, suffering from paralysis of both upper extremities, and remained there two months, when he was discharged not materially better. Two months before his death he became an out-patient at this Hospital, and improved so much that he could raise both hands to his mouth and walk a considerable distance. A fortnight before his death he was thrown down in the street, striking on the back of his head, and was brought to the Hospital in the condition described. 1141. Portion of Spine in the cervical region. There has been a fracture, with separation of the fifth from the sixth vertebra. The upper portion of the spine is displaced forwards, so that the body of the fifth vertebra lies in front of the sixth ; the upper and posterior portion of the latter projects backwards, and obliterates the spinal canal. From a boy aged 15 years, who received an injury to the spine one year and seven months before his death. There was complete paralysis of sensation and motion in the trunk and extremities immediately after the accident. The spinal cord was found to have been com- pletely destroyed at the seat of injury.—See Marley Ward BooJc, vol. iv, p. 209. 1142.

Section of a Spine, in which there is a fracture of a Dorsal Vertebra, either the third or the fourth. The front of its body is crushed between the vertebra) above and below it, and the posterior part has been driven backwards into the spinal canal, and has completely divided the cord. The spinous and articular processes of the fractured vertebrae are torn away from those of the vertebra above it, leaving- a wide gap at the posterior part of the spinal column. iv. 1 1147. Portion of a Spine, including the lower Cervical and upper Dorsal Ver- tebras.

Portion of a Spine, including the Lower Cervical and Upper Dorsal Verte- bras. The intervertebral substance between the last cervical and the first dorsal vertebras is torn through, and the upper portion of the spine is carried forward m such a manner, that the first dorsal vertebra presses backwards upon the cord, which is here crushed, softened, and ecchymosed. From a heavy man, aged 63 years, who fell upon his shoulders. There was complete loss of motion below the thorax, but sensation was perfect. He died on the fifth day after the 1165. Section of part of the Dorsal Region of a Spinal Column, in which there had been dislocation between the seventh and eighth vertebras, with fracture of the body and spinous process of the seventh. The line of fracture can be seen m the specimen.172 DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OP THE SPINE. 1166. Eight half of the preceding Specimen. It shows the almost complete repair that has taken place in the bones and soft textures of the spine ; and the disintegration resulting from the injury of the cord. Prom a spare man, aged 48 years, who fell backwards on to his shoulders from a fcaffold about six feet from the ground. A well-marked displacement between the 7th and 8th dorsal vertebra was observable on his admission into the Hospital; the 7th with the bones above appeared to be carried forwards, producing an unnatural groove from the 4th vertebra to the broken 7th spinous process. The superior articular processes of the 8th could be leit. ±ne ordinary svmptoms of lesion of the corresponding part of the spinal cord were present. The patient, under chloroform, was subjected to extension by means of pulleys with the result of replacing the bones in their normal position, and entirely removing the distortion. He died from exhaustion, consequent on the paralysis, nine weeks afler the injury. 1167. Sections of a Spine, in which it is probable that there had been a fracture and dislocation of the first lumbar and the last dorsal vertebra*. The first lumbar vertebra, unchanged in texture, but deprived of the fore part ot the upper margin of its body, is thrown backwards, so that its fractured anterior maro-in is placed under the posterior margin of the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. It appears as if the last dorsal vertebra with the superior portion of the spine, had been pushed forwards and downwards, breaking oft and sliding over the upper and anterior margin of the first lumbar. In this position the two vertebras are firmly fixed by bone deposited in front of the angle formed by their bodies. At the angle thus formed the body of the first lumbar vertebra projects posteriorly into the spinal canal, reducing it to a fourth of its natural diameterf A distance of an inch intervenes between the spinous processes of the last dorsal and the first lumbar vertebras. On the right side their corresponding articular surfaces appear to have been separated, and re-united by bone; on the left side the inferior articular process of the last dorsal vertebra is wanting: but there are appearances as if it had been united to the posterior part of the body of the displaced first lumbar vertebra: it was probably detached in the dissection.

The following Specimens were prepared by Sir J. Paget and Mr. Savory. U8.7: ofmia y°™g rabbit killed twenty hours after the division of the Tendo Achillis The upper end of the tendon has retracted above three-quarters of an inch and is slightly connected to the lower portion by a soft gelatinous blood- speckled material effused between them within the sheath. 1188. Leg of a rabbit killed sixty-eight hours after division of the Tendo Achillis 1 he ends of the divided tendon are about three-quarters of an inch apart, and the interval between them is filled by a firm clot of blood. 1189. Leg of a rabbit killed six days after division of the Tendo Achillis The skm alone has been removed; it was more firmly adherent than usual to the parts beneath; and here and there were small clots, the remains of minute176 DISEASES AND INJURIES OP MUSCLES, extravasations of blood. There is a general enlargement of the tendon within the sheath where divided, the swelling tapering gradually into the natural size and shape of the tendon. The wound of the sheath is soundly and completely closed. 1190. Hind Leg of a young rabbit killed six days after divisions of the Tendo Achillis. On removing the skin, the same appearances were observed as m the last specimen. The enlargement has been divided longitudinally. The ends of the tendon are separated about three-quarters of an inch, and the interval between them has been filled up by a gelatinous material, in which the ends of the divided tendon are embedded. The outer portion of this new material is firm and resisting, the central portion softer, and as if blood-stained. Outside the new material and around it are several small patches of ecchymosis. In minute structure the inner and softer portion appeared granular, while the outer and firmer portion was more distinctly fibrous. 1191. Leo- of a rabbit ten days after division of the tendon. The ends of the tendon are connected by firm new material, in the centre of which are one or two distinct small clots. 1192 Leg of a young rabbit killed ten days after division of the Tendo Achillis. The ends of the tendon were separated to the extent of almost an inch, Ihe o-ap has been filled by a firm tissue, with small spots of ecchymosis m the centre The new material was firm and elastic, closely united with the sheath, and blending gradually with the ends of the tendon, but easily distinguishable from the glistening and shining fibres of the latter. It was very firm, not easily torn out under the microscope, and consisted of tolerably well-tormed fibrous tissue, dark in colour, and thickly interspersed with granular cells. 1193 Leo; of a young rabbit killed ten days after division of the tendon, and iniected with carmine. The ends of the tendon are separated rather more than halt an inch Between them is an oval circumscribed clot, decolorised, but sur- rounded by the same firm new material, which is blended with and connects the ends of the tendon. In structure, this new material presents the same cha- racters as the last specimen. 1194 Leo- of a rabbit killed fourteen days after division of the Tendo Achillis. A faro-eVantity of blood has been poured out between the separated portions of the tendon, extending upwards into the substance of the muscle above. The ends of the tendon were firmly connected by new fibrous tissue outside the clot. 1195 Leo- of a very young rabbit killed thirty-four days after division of the Tendo Achillis. The tendon has so completely regained its normal size and appearance that a very slight enlargement only marks the spot where it had been divided. Just opposite this point the sheath has been turned back.

Later on the breathing became embarrassed, and he died. No cardiac symptoms were noticed, and no history of rheumatism could be obtained from the wife. A brother was said to have died from rheumatic fever. There was no history of insanit y in his kindred. On post-mortem examination the convolutions of the brain were found wasted ; there were white spots on the pia mater ; the arteries were enlarged and tortuous. The liver was wasted, cirrhotic, and stained with bile. The spleen was large and very firm. The kidneys were large, with adherent capsules ; the cortical substance wasted, red, not pale, and waxy. No amyloid reaction was found anywhere. There was no calcification of the larger arteries. Presented by Dr. Claye Shaw. Vide No. 1313.183 PERICARDIUM, AND OF THE HEART. L. YMPHO-SAE.COM A. 1239. The Contents of a Thorax. The pericardium is infiltrated by a growth, which appears from microscopic examination to be a lympho-sarcoma. At the base of the heart it is over an inch in thickness, but towards the apex gradually becomes thinner. The inner surface is lined by a distinct fibrous membrane, which is rugous and papillated. The growth forms a large pro- jecting mass at the base of the heart, and extends along the pulmonary vessels to the lungs. The arch of the aorta is surrounded and compressed: the vagi are seen entering the growth. The trachea, bronchi, and sesophagus ai*e free. A group of infiltrated and conglomerate mediastinal lymphatic glands is con- nected with the tumour: the cervical glands are also affected. The heart is small, and the visceral layer of pericardium is but slightly thickened. The cavity of the pericardium contained a saneous fluid. The tumour is mode- rately firm, and its section pale and homogeneous; A similar tumour of small size was connected with the xiphoid cartilage. Microscopic Examination.—The growth is composed of small round cells, exactly resembling those in the enlarged lymphatic glands, supported by an abundant matrix of ill-developed con- nective tissue. Fibrous trabecuhe traverse it in various directions. In the enlarged lymphatic glands the distinction between the cortical and medullary portion is lost, and the trabecular have disappeared; a considerable qiiantity of newly formed connective tissue is interspersed among the cell elements. No multi-nuclear cells were seen. From a man, aged 20 years. The first symptoms observed were pain in the chest, sickness after food, ami palpitation. There was general impulse over the praxordiurn when he first came under observation. Five months later he was readmitted. There was then a projection of the left supra-mammary region close to the sternum. He had dyspnoea, subject to exacerba- tion, and laryngeal cough. There was fullness at the root of the neck on both sides. The radial pulses were unequal. The symptoms of intra-thoracic pressure increased, and he died two months later, one year after the onset of symptoms.—See Mark Ward Book, 1879 ; also Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxxi, 1881.

The duration of her illness was two years. Emaciation was extreme, and the other viscera were remarkably small. FATTY INFILTRATION. 1244. A Heart, exhibiting great enlargement of the cavity of the left ventricle, with thickening of its walls. There is abundant formation of fat on the whole exterior of the heart; on the right ventricle it forms a layer half an inch in thickness. The coronary arteries are not ossified. The aortic and mitral valves are large and thin, but appear of healthy texture. xn. 12 The patient, a man 25 years old, attributed the origin of his disease to a fit of passion twelve months before his death. He shortly after observed unnaturally strong pulsations in all his large arteries and at his heart. These continued till his death, all the arteries appear- ing to be dilated. He had also great dyspnoea, aggravated in paroxysms, during which he was in the habit of taking large quantities of digitalis. 1245. Large Heart taken from a man, who, although but five feet seven or eight inches in height, weighed some mouths before death 30 stone 6 lbs. He was w-ell known for his gluttony. The heart deprived of blood weighed 2 lbs. 6j ozs. The aortic and pulmonary valves are competent. The liver weighed 6 lbs. 10^ ozs. It was engorged with dark blood and fatty. The kidneys weighed together 211 ozs. Presented by Dr. Thomas Oliver, of Preston. FATTY DEGENERATION. 1246. Heart of a man, who died under the influence of chloroform. The ventri- cular walls, especially on the right side of the heart, appear to be in a state of advanced fatty degeneration. For other specimens, see 1247 to 1252, 1256, and 1370. RUPTURE OF THE HEART FROM DISEASE. 1247. A Left Ventricle ruptured. The opening is a mere fissure through the muscular substance, at the junction of the anterior wall with the septum, near the middle of the heart. The wall of the ventricle around the opening is not thinner than in other situations : but the muscular substance is softer than is natural, and of a brown colour. There are numerous small deposits of fatty matter beneath the lining of the aorta, and of the left ventricle ; and the quan- tity of fat on the exterior of the heart is greater than is natural. xit . 22 1248. A Left Ventricle ruptured about mid-distance between its base and apex, and near the junction of its anterior wall with the septum. The aperture is of considerable extent; and around it the wall of the ventricle is of its natural thickness. The muscular substance appears soft, and of a dull brown colour. Earthy matter is deposited in the coats of the aorta. XII. 27 1249. Portion of a Heart in which rupture of the left ventricle has occurred. The heart is of natural size, with abundant fat at its base and over the coronary arteries that branch on its surface. In the middle of the prominent rounded pa-rt of the left ventricle is a rent, about an inch in length, extending obliquely downwards from the middle of the ventricle towards its apex. Below this, and in a line towards the apex, are two much smaller rents, which, like the larger, have irregular edges. They all extend into the cavity of the ventricle, and are seated in what appeared shortly after death as " a space of about three square inches, in which the colour of the muscular substance was a mottled dull yellow, or drab and pink; and no fascicular or fibrous structure could be discovered." In this space the muscular tissue was in a state of advanced fatty degeneration, while that of the rest of the heart was normal, or nearly so. The principal branch of the left coronary artery, leading to this part of the heart, is enlarged;PERICARDIUM, AND OF THE HEART. 185 its coats arc thickened and made rigid with opaque yellow deposits, and its cavity is filled with a tirni coagulum. It seems to be obliterated at the margin of the degenerated part, while the rest of the coronary arteries, though having many thickened and rigid patches, are pervious. XII. 85 The patient was a fat woman, 52 years old. " She appears never to have complained of breathlessness or palpitation, and never was known to faint. But latterly she spoke of a sense of oppression at the chest." The impulse and sounds of the heart were feeble. Three years before death she had a paralytic seizure, from which she slowly and partially recovered. Her death was instantaneous. A further account of the case is in the Reports of the Pathological Society of London, vol. iii, p. 264, by Dr. Baly, by whom the specimen was presented. 1250. The Heart of an old woman, aged 82 years. She was a lunatic, and had been in Bethlehem Hospital forty-two years. She died suddenly while sitting quietly. At the lower and front part of the left ventricle, close to the septum, is a rent through the wall, the muscular tissue of which is in an advanced state of fatty degeneration. 1251. Rupture of the wall of the left ventricle of a Heai-t, the muscular tissue of which has undergone fatty degeneration. The valves contain calcareous matter. The rupture proved instantly fatal. The pericardial cavity was filled with a blood-clot, weighing one pound. Presented by J. S. D. Danes, Esq. 1252. Heart of a Demented Woman, aged 70 years, who died suddenly, after a paroxysm of rage. On the under surface of the left ventricle is a jagged rent, about three-quarters of an inch in length, through which blood escaped so as to till the sac of the pericardium. The muscular tissue is degenerated. The brain was much atrophied. More than three pints of fluid escaped from the arachnoid cavity, the lateral ventricles, and spinal canal. All the arteries of the brain (especially those at the base) were very atheromatous. Presented by Dr. Claye Shaw. 1253. Rupture of the left ventricle of a Heart near its apex. 26 From a powerful, healthy man, of temperate habits, a watchmaker, aged 4fi. The rupture occurred at a moment when he was greatly excited in consequence of the misconduct of a rela- tive. The symptoms commenced whilst he was walking, and consisted of a sensation of weight and tightness on the left side of the chest, with dyspnoea. The second day he walked three or four miles with difficulty, and worked as usual, the distress continuing. The third day he walked two miles with great difficulty, his symptoms being much aggravated. The fourth day he walked half a mile, stopping seven or eight times, and described the sensation as that of a cord tightly drawn round his chest. On the fifth day he complained of a dull pain in the region of the heart, which in a few hours became severe, and extended, especially along the upper extremities. 5 He died in great agony, both of body and mind, a few hours later.—Journal of Morbid Anatomy, 1828, p. 14. From the collection of J. R. Farrc, Esq., M.D. 1254. Heart of an Adult. The cavity of the right auricle is larger than natural and its membranous lining is thick and opaque. The tricuspid valve is thickened. The cavity of the left ventricle is larger than natural. Its muscular substance is considerably thickened, and its lining is opaque. The aortic valves are a little thickened, and there is soft matter deposited beneath the linino- of the aorta just above the valves. The coronary arteries are thickened, and there is earthy matter deposited between their coats. A rupture of the septum between the ventricles has taken place near its union with the posterior wall of the heart, by which a free communication is formed between the ventricles ' On the side of the left ventricle the opening is about two inches in leno-th and of186 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE a semilunar form. On the side of the right ventricle, the opening is much smaller and rounded. xn* ^ DILATATION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE CARDIAC CAVITIES. 1255. A Heart, in which the cavities of both Ventricles are enlarged, while their walls are thinner than is natural. The walls of the right ventricle are especially diminished in thickness. The valves on both sides of the heart are healthy. xn. 10 The patient was a man 34 years old. The case is related by Mr. James, in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vol. viii, p. 449. London, 1817. 1256. A Heart, of which both the ventricles are dilated, thin-walled, and pale. The inner surface of the left ventricle, especially at its septum, is mottled with pale-yellowish lines and spots due to fatty degeneration of its fibres. xn. 79 1257. A Heart, exhibiting great enlargement of the cavity of the left ventricle, with some increase of the thickness of its walls. The aortic valves and the internal coat of the aorta are slightly thickened and opaque. xn. 9 1258. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and rigidity of the mitral valve and of its tendinous cords, with extreme contraction of the left auriculo-ventricular opening. The cavity of the left auricle is enlarged; its lining membrane is opaque" and thickened; and a thick layer of dry laminated coagulum is firmly attached to the upper and posterior part of its wall, where it is rather more dilated than elsewhere. xn- 1259. Part of a Heart, exhibiting a great dilatation of the left auricle, with thick- ening of its membranous lining, and with thickening, induration, and contrac- tion of the mitral valve and tendinous cords. Portions of fibrin, arranged in concentric layers, adhere to the thickened membranous lining of a part of the auricle which is more dilated than the rest.

PARTIAL DILATATION OF THE CARDIAC WALL, OR ANEURISM OF THE HEART. 1260. Section of a Left Ventricle, with a shallow Aneurismal Pouch at its side. The inner surface of the pouch is smooth, and apparently formed by the lining of the ventricle partially covered by layers of fibrin. The pericardium is adherent to its outer surface. XIL 30 1261. A Heart, exhibiting a pouch formed by dilatation of a circular portion of the anterior wall of the left ventricle near its base. The pouch was filled by laminated coagulum; its mouth is round, narrow, and smooth; and its parietes, apparently, consist of the serous covering and inner membrane of the heart, thickened,'united, and having small deposits of a soft yellowish substance in and around them. The muscular tissue of this part has entirely disap- peared. The coagulum which was within the pouch is at the bottom of the bottle. xn- 53 The patient was a girl 19 years old. The disease of the heart probably commenced about 18 months before death ; but its progress was marked by yarious and singular attacks of paralysis, erysipelas, and signs of phlebitis. 1262. A Heart, with a Sac attached to the left side of its left ventricle. The sac is spheroidal in form, and upwards of three inches in its greater diameter. Its walls are composed of the exterior of the ventricle, the pericardium, and a dense tissue by which the opposite surfaces of the pericardium were adherent. It is lined by irregularly laminated coagula: the phrenic nerve runs over its anterior part; it communicates with the cavity of the ventricle by an oval aperture,187 PERICARDIUM, AND OF THE HEART. about a quarter of an inch in diameter, the margins of which are smooth and round. A. portion of white glass is passed through this aperture. The muscular substance of the ventricle immediately around the aperture has disappeared, and is replaced by a dense white tissue. The rest of the heart is healthy; but its exterior is covered by false membrane by which it adhered to the parietal pericar- dium. It may be presumed that there was in this case a rupture, or an ulcera- tion, through the wall of the left ventricle; that the blood was prevented from being effused into the cavity of the pericardium, by adhesions previously formed between its two surfaces; and that these adhesions, and the peri- cardium for a considerable distance around the aperture, were stretched by the force of the blood, so as to form the sac, in nearly the same manner as a false aneurism is formed by the distension of the sheath of an artery after the destruction of the coats. xii. 58 From a woman 37 years old, who had had syphilis for many years in its worst form. She had long been under observation at the Penitentiary; but had presented no distinct sign of disease of the heart. She died with dysentery and slight bronchitis. Presented by Dr. Baly. 1263. A Left Ventricle and Auricle. In the boundary between the auricle and ventricle the wall of the heart is dilated into a pouch, like an aneurism, which extends round the outer part of the base of the left ventricle, from the anterior to the posterior margins of the septum. The mouth of this pouch is just below, and partly covered by, the mitral valve: its cavity is half filled by concentric layers of fibrin. The cavity of the left ventricle is much enlarged; its walls are thickened; and its lining membrane, near the aneurismal sac, is thick, rough, and has yellow deposits in it. The exterior of the heart is covered by adhesions, which fixed it closely to the inner surface of the pericardium. The mitral valve and its tendinous cords are thickened and opaque, especially in those parts which are stretched over the mouth of the aneurismal sac. xn. 28. The patient was a man between 40 and 50 years old. He had long suffered with signs of diseased heart. 1264. An Aneurism, the size of a large hen's egg, opening into the left ventricle at the very apex; the opening is about the size of a threepenny piece, and its edges as smooth and as densely fibrous as a valvular orifice. The aneurism itself is divided by a septiim into two parts, which communicate with each other immediately below the opening into the ventricle. The walls of the sac are thin and fibrous, except at the part where there is a thick layer of laminated fibrin. There were exceedingly dense adhesions all around the aneurism. The cause of death was general dropsy associated with contracted kidneys. From a person aged 33 years.—See Post Mortem Book, Case 197, May 17th, 1871. 1265. An Aneurism at the Apex of the Left Ventricle. The pericardium is uni- versally adherent; the heart of great size, most of the swelling being formed by the sac of the aneurism, which would hold a cocoa nut. The aneurismal sac communicated with the left ventricle by a small opening the size of a split pea. " The patient, an old soldier, when first seen in October, 1872, complained of extreme breath- lessness on slight exertion, and a sense of tightness across the chest. He referred his illness to a strain experienced a month previously in an attempt to lift a henry package when ho felt something give way in his chest, and fell down in a severe faint. The heart's action was tumultuous on slight disturbance ; the cardiac dulness was extended downwards and to the ri^f and there was a double murmur at the apex. His symptoms were relieved under treatment and he was able to work as a carman until October, 1874, when he died with pleuritic effusion — 19th 1874 ^ ^ Path0l°9ical Society> voL xxyii> 1875> or Luke Ward Book, October 1266.

The aperture is nearly filled by a round firm clot of blood. 1267. Heart from a Man aged 60, who died of Emphysema. In the undefended space there is a hemispherical pouch about the size of half a marble. Its walls are thin and translucent, and crossed by bands of tissue arranged like the musculi pectinati of the right auricle.

FIBRINOUS MASSES, AND BLOOD-CLOTS IN THE CARDIAC CAVITIES. 1270. The anterior wall of a Right Auricle and Ventricle, with part of a firm decolorised coagulum clinging to its inner surface. This coagulum is moulded to the inequalities of the muscular bands, as shown m the upper portion of the preparation, where it is turned away from the cardiac wall. It also extends uninterruptedly behind the cusps of the anriculo-ventricular valve. On one side the right, is a layer of coloured coagulum, part of a clot which commenced in the vena? cavae, extended thence into the cavities of the heart, and terminated at the apex of the right ventricle. XIL y 1271 Part of the Posterior Wall of the same Cavities, and the commencement of the'pulmonary artery. The remainder of the clot which occupied the right cavities is here seen. Above, it commences as a tape-like portion which occupied the upper and left side of the canal of the superior vena cava the remainder bein- filled by the coloured coagulum already described The decolorised clot extends behind the valve cusps, and is continued through the mf unclibuluni into the pulmonary artery. The latter portion is superficially streaked, above ind below with thin layers of coloured coagula, but these have no connection with those derived from the venae cavae. On the other hand, they can be traced upwards into the canal of the pulmonary artery. xn. 9o From a woman who died with colloid cancer of the ovaries.

After death the veu , of the neck and of the uPPor extremities, down to the fingers' ends, were full of blood lho lungs contained masses of tubercle in various stages, and the lower lobe of the right was much congested. The pericardium contained six ounces of clear serum. „ Presented by Mr Gross, by whom the case is described in the Medical Times and Gazette, May 12th, 18G6. 1274. Heart of a Woman, aged 43 years, with dilatation of all its cavities. The mitral orifice is greatly contracted, so as only to admit the tip of the little finger. In the left auricle was found the round ball suspended over the heart. It is about an inch in diameter, very elastic, very smooth, without any trace of pedicle, and lay quite loose in the left auricle. It appears to be formed of fibrin, and without doubt had been in process of formation a long time before death. For a drawing of the recent specimen, see No. 83. A similar specimen is in the Museum of St. G-eorge's Hospital. 1275. The Appendix of a Left Auricle. It is occupied by a clot, which is closely adapted to its wall. The top of the coagulum is raised to show the ragged, broken-down character of its interior. In the recent state this central portion was soft and diffluent, of the colour of ordinary pus. It consisted of granular matter and oil globules, the latter in great abundance. xii. 91 From a case of rigid and patent mitral valve, with hypertrophy and dilatation of the left auricle. 1276. Part of a Left Auricle. A large coagulum clings to its endocardial lining, occupying the most posterior portion of the cavity, the pulmonary veins opening on either side. The surface of the clot is rough, and in parts presents a beaded appearance, the beads being arranged in tolerably uniform lines across the cur- rent of the blood. The clot contained a quantity of grumous, yellowish material, consisting of granular matter and abundant oil globules. This escaped through a post-mortem rent in its wall, seen on the front of the coagulum, where also can be noticed the tenuity of the shell of fibrin which separated it from the blood. The endocardium retains a natural appearance. XII. 93 From a case of patent and thickened mitral valve, which proved fatal from extensive pulmo- nary apoplexy. The auricle was greatly dilated. No symptoms existed during life to indicate the formation of the coagulum. 1277. Portion of a Heart in which there is a round mass attached to the inside of the left auricle, near the fossa ovalis. When recent, the mass was, in texture, like a gelatinous polypus of the nose, yellowish, but spotted with blood, semi-transparent, uniform, and smooth on its cut surface. On detaching a portion of it from the lining of the auricle, this was left rough and otherwise altered in its texture. xn. 35 From a man 30 years old, who died with fracture of his pelvis received on the day before his death. 1278.

The Specimen was taken from the body of a man, aged 38 years. Two bulgings were found near the apex of the left ventricle; one the size of a marble, and the other of a walnut. They are lined on the inside with fibrin, and are due to the appearance on the wall of the ventricle of a firm whitish-yellow substance dispersed in islets amongst muscular tissue. This white appearance is also seen along the attachment of the small flap of the mitral valve. Under the micro- scope this material presented the characters of a gumma.—See Trans. Path.

Projecting into the left ventricle towards the anterior part of the septum is a roundish plaque about the size of a florin, which has been divided. The surface of the projection was found covered by a ragged, decolorised, friable clot, evidently old. It is rough and fibrous looking, and its lining is continuous with the endocardium. The section of the projection shows a firm fibrous structure about a quarter of an inch thick, which appears to be formed by a fibrous thickening of the endocardium. Im- mediately beneath is a layer of loose fibrous tissue intermixed with which, but more abundantly towards the deeper surface, is a small quantity of muscular tissue. The endocardium is generally thickened over the surface of the ventricle, the thickening being greatest around the projection. The left brachial artery was plugged from its commencement to its bifurcation; the plug also extended into the radial and ulnar arteries. Emboli were also found in the digital, superior mesenteric and hepatic arteries. Two small perforating ulcers were found in the jejunum, evidently the result of deficient blood supply from embolism. Microscopic Examination.—The growth was found to be composed of fibrous tissue, which was dense, and arranged in parallel bundles throughout the greater part of its thickness, but loose and reticular towards the deeper surface. No distinct endothelial lining could be detected on the ventricular surface to which the remains of blood clot were adherent. The connective tissue between the subjacent muscular fibres was increased. The specimen was taken from a man, aged 36 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with dry gangrene of the tips of the left index and little fingers, supposed to be due to frost bite. Symp- toms of peritonitis developed themselves, and he died collapsed. See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 28; also an account of tbe case by Mr. H. T. Butlin, in the Path. Soc.

Part of a Heart, with a large medullary cancerous tumour in the right ventricle. The specimen, in its recent state, was thus described: " The heart was of about the natural size, externally healthy, with the exception of a pale spot on the anterior surface of the right ventricle : the walls were thin and flabby; the valves efficient; and all the cavities healthy, except that of the right ventricle, which appeared nearly filled by some roundish masses of a dull red colour and soft consistency, springing from a point corresponding with the pale spot on the external surface of the heart; their free, rounded extremities were directed towards the pulmonary artery, and the tip of the longer lobule was not more than an inch distant from the lower edge of its valves. Parallel to this and to its right lay a similarly-shaped but shorter mass, which was separated from the next mass by the columnae carnese giving origin to the chorda? tendineaa for the left flap of the tricuspid valve ; so that the next lobule, which was shorter than the two preceding, thicker and somewhat cleft at its fore end, pro- jected into the ring of the valves. Below lay two or three roundish, flattened masses, extending quite to the apex of the ventricle. Jnst about the attach- ment of the larger masses the muscular substance of the heart appeared in- filtrated with encephaloid matter ; but nearer the apex, where the tumours were smaller, the muscular substance was comparatively, if not quite free; the masses being attached by roots ramifying among the columnse carnece, and adhering to the surface without actually penetrating into the muscular sub- stance of the organ. XII 75 The patient was a man, 48 years old. Two years before death his testicle enlarged with medullary cancer. It was removed three months before death, and he recovered from the operation, but was unable to continue at his work. No characteristic signs of this disease of the heart existed during life : " A systolic murmur was audible at the apex, of a faintly musical character, and one of a soft, blowing character was heard in both the pulmonary artery and the aorta." The patient died exhausted, but never had hteinoptysis, anasarca, or enlargement of the superficial veins of the abdomen. Medullary cancer was found in a large mass on the lumbar vertebra?, and in a smaller one in the neck. The case is related by Dr. Ormerod in the Medico-Chinvnjleal Transactions, 1847 vol. xxx p. 39.

The aorta is dilated, and both it and its valves have earthy deposits in them. xn. 60 From the patient, from whom the eye, Series XXXIII No. 2625, was removed He died two years after the operation with this medullary disease of the heart, similar deposits in the lungs, and a large medullary tumour on the lower jaw. 1293 A Heart, in which there are imbedded, in the middle of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, several small masses of a yellowish firm substance. Some of them are prominent in the cavity of the ventricle ; but the largest, which is darker and firmer than the others, projects externally, and is situated at the bottom of a recess in the wall of the heart, like the sac of an aneurism. Ihe muscular substance of the heart is wasted around this largest mass, and a thm laver or capsule of fibro-cellular tissue invests it. The pericardium was ad- herent to its surface and to the adjacent part of the surface of the ventricle xn. 55 The patient was a girl, who, for a long time before her death, had complained of nearly constant pain about the heart, but presented no other sign of cardiac disease.

The cyst projects into the lower part of the right ventricle, and gives a rounded form to the apex of the heart. XII. 40 The patient was a woman 40 years old. Her health had appeared declining for some years ; and about eighteen months before her death she began to have dyspnoea on exertion and occa- sional pain at the heart. Six weeks before death more severe signs of disease of the heart were brought on by an unusual exertion, and these continued and were aggravated till she died.

It is believed that the fibrin obstructing the artery was detached from the valves of the heart, and carried in the stream ot blood to the spot at which it was arrested. XIL °" The patient, 24 years old, had suffered for two months with diarrhoea and rheumatic pains, when he was suddenly attacked with severe pain in the region of the heart, and palpitation. These were relieved, but a fortnight after their commencement he suddenly became hemiplegic on the left side. He remained with impaired sensation, and complete loss of voluntary motion, to the time of his death, about three weeks after the hemiplegic attack. He had also sloughs on his back, and swelling of the feet and legs, and Ins femoral veins were hard, cord- ^BwraSSe of the brain was remarkably pale and soft. Clots of old formation existed in the left lateral sinus and internal jugular vein. The tricuspid valve was covered with fibrinous deposits like those above described. The iliac and femoral veins were blocked up by old clots without disease of their coats. Masses of fibrinous deposits were found m the lower lobes ot both lun^s and the corresponding branches of the pulmonary arteries were completely plugged Witfl old coaenda. Fibrinous deposits, also, variously changed, existed in the spleen ami kidneys. A fuller report of the case is given by Dr. Kirkes, in the Medico-Chirurgtcal Transactions, vol. xxx, p. 293. 1300. A Heart, of which a great part of the mitral valve is covered with masses of fibrin, heaped up in the shape of large warty excrescences on its auricular surface, and thence extending over part of the lining of the posterior wall ot the left auricle. The masses of fibrin are of various shapes and lengths ; some are nearly half an inch long. They are pretty firmly attached to the thick and lengthened surface of the valve, yet portions could be readily detached, and crumbled under pressure. Several of the masses extend among the tendinous cords of the valves; and one of the cords, thickened like the rest, is ulcerated across, and portions of fibrin adhere to each of its separated ends The left ventricle is much hypertrophied; the right side of the heart, and the other valves are healthy. xn- 87 The patient, a thin, pale woman, 24 years old, had sudden hemiplegia about three months before death At the time of the seizure she appeared m tolerable health, but had been Bubiect to great privations. The hemiplegia appeared to be due to detachment of portions ot the fibrin from the surface of the valve; one of which, being carried on by the circulating blood had become tightly impacted in the left middle cerebral artery, obliterating its canal, and inducing softening of the left corpus striatum and thalamus opticus. The branches of the artery beyond the obstruction were reduced to firm, narrow, yellowish cords, which were im- bedded in softened cerebral substance. A similar but smaller portion of fibrin was found m the ri<dit middle cerebral artery, but did not quite block up its canal. Old clots of blood obstructed also the right external iliac artery and the right femoral vein. A fuller report of the case, by Dr. Kirkes, is in the essay above referred to. ULCERATION OF THE VALVES. 1301. A portion of the Heart, with the origin of the Aorta. The aortic valves are extensively ulcerated, and upon the ulcerated surface a large amount of fibrin has been deposited. Attached to the anterior cusp by a long narrow pedicle (the remains of the free margin of the valve) is an irregular mass of fibrin the size of a large nut. This mass in the recent state was continuous with a clot, which extended along the aorta, into the innominate and to the left subclavian arteries. The wall of the left ventricle is hypertrophied. The pericardium is roughened by recent lymph. From the body of a man, aged 36 years. After suffering from rheumatic pains in the limbs for three weeks, and pains in the chest for six days, he came (walking) to the out- patients' room of the Hospital. He was admitted ; and the next morning, having gone to the water-closet he was soon afterwards found dead there. 1302. A Heart showing the condition known as Ulcerative Endo-carditis.

The third is perforated by an ulcer, the edges of which are ragged, and everted towards the ventricle. There is some thickening of the adjacent wall of the aorta. These changes were preceded by rheumatism. XII on 1304. A Mitral Valve greatly thickened. Its cusps, united amongst themselves, project into the auriculo-ventricular opening, forming a rigid ring. A narrow chink remains for the passage of the blood, and was probably always patent. _ 36 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1305. Aortic Valves, thickened and opaque. The chief thickening is in the adjacent halves of two valves, whose angles, either congenitally or by later morbid adhesion, are united and drawn down.

A Heart, exhibiting thickening, opacity, and rigidity of the tricuspid and mitral valves, with contraction of both the auriculo-ventricular orifices. The cavities of the auricles are dilated, and their membranous linings are thickened. The right auriculo-ventricular orifice would just admit the passage of the fore- finger ; the left would only admit the entrance of the tip of the same finger. xii. 44* 1313. A Heart, in which, by thickening and contraction of the mitral valve and its tendinous cords, the left auriculo-ventricular orifice is reduced to an irregular chink, about an inch long, and from one to two lines in width. On the auricular surface of the diseased valves there are also projections of earthy matter, and deposits of layers of fibrin. The lining membrane of the left auricle is thickened and opaque: so also are the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and, in a much greater degree, the aortic valves. The pericardium was universally adherent, and in several places, especially on the anterior surface of the ventricles, portions of bone have been formed in the adhesions. Some of these have been exposed by dissection. The whole heart is enlarged, all its cavities being dilated and hypertrophied in nearly equal proportions. XII. 59 Jb rom a man 27 years old. He could not remember to have been ever free from signs of disease of the heart, but they were greatly aggravated after an attack of acute rheumatism. 1314. Section of a Heart, showing its general hypertrophy in consequence of disease of the mitral and tricuspid valves. All its cavities are dilated, and the walls of all are, in proportion, thickened by a growth of strong muscular tissue. The mitral and tricuspid valves are thick, opaque, and leathery, and their orifices are patent and contracted ; the orifice of the tricuspid having a nearly circular shape, that of the mitral, a narrow, crescentic shape. xii. 88 1315. Heart of a woman, aged 33 years. All the cavities of the heart are dilated, especially the auricles. Both appendices contained old, tough, colourless fibrin. The muscular walls are much indurated, but not greatly hypertro- phied. The tricuspid orifice is greatly narrowed by adhesion of contiguous edges of segments of the valve, so as to admit only the tip of the finger. The pulmonary valves are natural. The mitral orifice is greatly narrowed by adhesion of its cusps. The aortic valves are incompetent, thickened, narrowed, adherent by their edges; there are numerous minute vegetations along the edges. The right subclavian vein was occupied by an old decolorised thrombus. See Post Mortem Book, March 19, 1872. DISEASE OF THE PULMONARY VALVES. 1316. A Heart, in which there arc but two pulmonary semilunar valves, and both of these are covered with thick irregular layers of soft fibrin and vegetations, which are deposited in such quantity on the posterior valve, that they form a layer extending quite across the artery. On the internal wall of the artery there are several small wart-like bodies, which are firmly adherent to it; and behind the posterior valve, there is a circumscribed ulceration of the inner membrane. The rest of the heart, its other valves, and the large vessels, are healthy. xn. 55PERICARDIUM AND OF THE HEART. 197 The pal Lent, a girl 21 years old, was admitted in a state of extreme debility. She had violent palpitation of the heart, and a lond bellovvs-sonnd, accompanying the first sound of the heart, was heard most distinctly at the base, and in a line extending thence upwards and to the left. She died exhausted; with old coagula, filling many of the branches of the pulmonary artery, and with pulmonary apoplexy, of which specimens are preserved in No. 1705, Series XI. The case is related by Sir J. Paget, in the Medico- Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xxvii, p. 182. London, 1317. A Heart, greatly enlarged, and with only two pulmonary valves. Both these valves are slightly thickened and opaque, and have large masses of fibrin mxsed with earthy matter attached to their free borders. One of these masses, three-quarters of an inch in length, hangs into the cavity of the ventricle, and appears, by its weight, to have elongated and drawn out the narrow portion of the edge of the valve to which it is attached. All the other valves are slightly opaque, but thm and pliant. There is a small granular patch of fibrin deposited on the posterior surface of one portion of the mitral valve. xn. 68 1318. The Heart, laid open, of a woman, aged 24, who was born deaf and dumb, lhe pulmonary valves are much thickened, apparently by deposits in the substance of the cusps. Their surfaces also are roughened. All the other valves are apparently healthy. The cavity of the left ventricle at its apex was occupied by a firm laminated mass, which lay in front of the endocardium, and was therefore probably an old clot. 1319.

The mfundibu um of the right ventricle is very narrow above. The pulmonary orifice is less than one-eighth of an inch across. Externally the base of the pulmonary artery is of the normal width. Looking into the artery from above, the orifice of com- munication with the heart is seen to be at the apex of a small bulb, rising from a membranous cone, which occupies the normal position of the pulmonary valves. This bulb is hollow on the ventricular side, and, with the cone, is probably the result of the adhesion of the pulmonary valves to one another. The edge of the orifice is fimbriated, and is thicker than the rest of the mem- brane, and in one-third of its circuit is calcified. There is a communication between the ventricles at the upper and anterior part of the septum ventricu- lorum. The opening has a muscular edge, and is large enough to admit the little finger. The child died of general dropsy. Her lungs were sound Her liver, spleen, and kidneys were engorged, but not diseased.—See St. Bartholomew s Hospital Reports, vol. xi. 1322. The Pulmonary Orifice and commencement of the Pulmonary Artery of a Boy, aged 16 years There is a circumscribed patch of vegetative endarteritis just above the junction of two cusps of the pulmonary valve. The patch is elevated, shelving gradually to the edge: at the summit is a crater-like opening with undermined edges, which leads into a small cavity bounded externally by the external coat of the artery. The disease also affects the two adjacent cusps of the pulmonary valve : the inner portion of the outermost is destroyed; its free edge is thickened, cloudy, and fringed by minute papilla?: the inner halt of the middle cusp is similarly thickened, cloudy, perforated at its lower part, but its attachment is not destroyed. The remainder of the pulmonary artery was healthy, as were also the other valves of the heart. The boy was admitted to the Hospital with what was believed to be phlegmonous erysipelas of the upper arm. Pyemia developed itself, of which he died. The autopsy revealed acute necrosis of the humerus. He had no cardiac symptoms.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 308. 1323. A portion of the Right Ventricle and the commencement of the Pulmonary Artery The cusps of the pulmonary valve are very extensively ulcerated. On one of the cusps a mass of fibrin the size of a hazel nut has been deposited. This, hanging by a narrow neck, and easily moving to and fro in the blood current, must have supplied to some extent the place of the valve. The heart was otherwise healthy.

A Heart, showing a probably congenital union of the margins of the two cusps of the mitral valve, leaving an opening nearly as large as a threepenny piece between the two cusps. Projecting into this opening and forming its outer boundary, is a small cusp which appears to be an exaggeration of the minute cusps found between the large cusps of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The bond of union between the cusps is thin and membranous, except at the margin of the opening, where it is thick and strengthened by fibrous tissue. Chorda3 tendineas are attached all around the margin of the interval between the cusps. A small tuft of vegetation is attached to the minute cusp described above: a vegetation is also attached to the margin of the opening formed by the aortic cusp.

The borders of the ulcer are sharp, abrupt, and jagged, like those of one making quick progress. The remainder of the aorta, and of the valves appears healthy. xn- ^ 1337. Part of a Heart, with the beginning of the Aorta and its valves. It is not certain whether there were originally two valves, or whether the appearance now presented be due to ulceration having destroyed the adjacent borders of two valves that were originally single and distinct. In either case ulceration, like that shown in the preceding specimens, has extensively destroyed the valvular substance, as well as its attachment to the base of the ventricle and its free border. A portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately behind the disease of the valves, is dilated in au irregular aneurismal sac. The internal coat of the dilated part appears entire, but slightly thickened and tuberculated. The opening of one of the coronary arteries is just above the dilatation. xn. 82 1338. Part of an Aorta. Ulceration, like that last described, has destroyed part of a valve, thickened and indurated by previous disease, but has not penetrated its free border. The whole inner coat of the aorta for a distance of from an inch to an inch and a half above the valves, is much thickened, opaque-white, and tuberculated. Immediately behind the ulcerated opening through the valve, a small portion of the diseased aorta is dilated into a hemispherical aneurismal pouch. m* ^ 1339.

The cusps of the aortic valve are adherent to one another, and converted into a hard, unyielding, calcareous ring, which projects into the aortic orifice, reducing it to an opening about three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Calcareous masses, continuous with the calcareous matter in the aortic valves, project on the inferior surface of the inner cusp of the mitral valve. The left ventricle is greatly hypertrophied.

Heart of a woman, aged 51 years, with aneurism of the mitral valve. The mitral valve is healthy at its attached and free borders, but in the centre of the laro-e (anterior) cusp is a circular aperture half an inch in diameter, leading into a sac, which projects into the auricle, and is formed by a dilatation of the layer of endocardium on the auricular aspect of the valve. The ventricular layer appears to cease just within the margin of the aperture. The aneurism is of conical shape, seated obliquely on the auricular surface of the valve. The largest side, that next the free border of the valve, is an inch and a quarter in length, the shortest, next the attached. border, a quarter of an inch. Its diameter at the base is three-quarters of an inch. At the apex is an aperture about a quarter of an inch in diameter, with an irregular fringed margin. There is a second minute orifice on one side, midway between base and apex. On the side of the auricle, at a part corresponding to the apex of the sac, is a white-patch. In the recent state the cavity was filled with coagula, partly dark and soft, partly firm and laminated. Both apertures, but especially the auricular, were fringed with fibrous vegetations. The free border of the aortic valves is' slightly thickened, and in one of them is a small round aperture almost in the situation of the central fibrous nodule. The heart weighed 13 ounces. The woman had enjoyed good health until ten months before death, when she had a severe attack of rheumatic fever. For the last two months only of her life she suffered from symp- toms of disease of the heart, such as dypsnoea, lividity of surface, and anasarca. There was a harsh systolic murmur at the apex and at the angle of the left scapula. 1355 A Mitral Valve, with some of the adjacent parts. The substance of the valve is generally somewhat thickened, and the middle of its left portion has been distended into a small bilocular pouch, like an aneurism. The pouch pro- jects into the cavity of the left auricle; it is about three-quarters of an inch hiffh and half an inch wide: its orifice on the ventricular surface of the valve is about a quarter of an inch in diameter. It has burst by a large irregular rent in one of its lateral walls. The aortic valves have numerous warty growths on their outer surface and borders, but are otherwise healthy. xn. 62 1356. A Heart, showing an aneurism projecting from the auricular surface of the'laro-e flap of the mitral valve. It is about the size of a marble, and has ruptured at the summit, where clots project from the opening.

On the inner flap, projecting towards the auricle, there is a small aneurismal sac with very thick walls, which is perforated by203 PERICARDIUM AND OF THE HEART. a minute aperture at its summit. On the upper and inner wall of the left auricle a patch of thickened endocardium covered by papillary granulations is seen.

Portion of an Aorta, exhibiting a large oval mass of fibrin mixed with earthy matter upon each of its semilunar valves. Below and behind one of the valves there is a small circumscribed pouch, into which a piece of glass is intro- duced. It is smoothly lined by a prolongation of the internal lining of the heart. xn. 42 From a girl 18 years old. Presented by P. C. Delagarde, Esq. 1360. Aneurism of the Mitral Valve. The smaller flap of the mitral valve shows on the upper surface a prominence about the size of a horse-bean, due to an aneurismal bulging of the valves. Long vegetations are attached to the free edge. See also St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xi, 1875, "Report from Post Mortem Room." 1361. A cusp of a Mitral Valve. On its ventricular aspect there is a circular opening, leading into a small aneurismal pouch, which projects on the opposite surface of the valve. 1362. A Heart, showing two aneurismal bulgings projecting from the auricular surface of the large flap of the mitral valve; the larger, rather flattened, is situated near the edge of the flap, close to its apex ; the smaller is nearer the centre of the flap. The auricular surface of the small flap is studded with vege- tations. The heart is hypertrophied.

A portion of the Left Ventricle of a child, aged 8 years, who was killed suddenly by a heavy cart falling over and crushing him beneath it. Both surfaces of the ventricle are dotted with small patches of ecchymosis. RUPTURE. 1364. A Heart, showing a rupture on the posterior surface of the right auricle, an inch and a half in length, extending upwards from the auriculo-ventricular orifice. There is also a small laceration on the posterior surface of the left ven- tricle, near the apex, which does not penetrate the wall. From a man who was killed by being squeezed between the buffers of two railway trucks None of the ribs were fractured. One of the lungs, also ruptuied, is preserved in Series Xf 1365. Rupture of the Right Ventricle and Auricle. A large rago-ed openino- is seen in the wall of the right ventricle, near the attachment of the pulmonaryDISEASES AND INJURIES OP THE 204 artery. There is a second opening at the posterior surface of the heart, through the wall of the right auricle, just below the vena cava inferior. The heart was taken from a man, aged 41 years, who fell from a height of fifty feet. The muscular substance of the organ was healthy. 1366. A Heart, in which a partial rupture of the walls of the auricle has taken place. In the posterior part of the right auricle, between the fossa ovalis and inferior vena cava, a rent an inch and a half in length, extends through the auricular septum In the posterior part of the left auricle, between and below the orifices of the pulmonary veins, a rent nearly two inches in length, exists m both the visceral pericardium and the endocardium ; and there is a small aperture between some of the muscular fibres thus exposed, through which a little blood escaped into the pericardial cavity. XIL '4 The patient was 38 years old. His leg was crushed by a heavy weight, and amputation was performed on the following day. He seemed to suffer but little from these shocks, and went on well until the fifth day, when extensive inflammation ensued in the tissues of the thigh. He was much depressed, but his case was not deemed hopeless till the twelfth day. At this time he suddenly became pale and more exhausted, and quickly died. From the time of the injury the pidse was generally feeble and frequent. During the last few days of his life the breatning was A clot of blood, about the size of a half-crown, was loose in the pericardial sac, and a smaller clot lay upon the auricles. Several small effusions of blood existed between the visceral peri- cardium and the muscular substance of the auricles and ventricles, especially of the former. The texture of the heart appeared quite healthy. 1367. A Heart and large Vessels, with the Trachea, and a portion of the left Lung, from a child 6 years old. An irregular rent extends through the whole length and thickness of the posterior wall of the left ventricle and auricle. A similar laceration extends through the upper part of the anterior wall of the left ventricle, and through the adjacent part of the septum. The left bronchus is torn across near the root of the lung. xn. 54 These injuries were the result of the passage of a heavy wheel over the chest of the child. Some of the ribs were fractured, but the pericardium was not torn. General emphysema was produced by the escape of air from the ruptured bronchus. 1368. A Heart, the left ventricle of which is extensively lacerated. The specimen was removed from the body of a middle-aged man, who was killed by the Fenian explosion in Clerkenwell in 1867. 1369. Heart of a child, aged 9 years. At the posterior part of the left ventricle is a longitudinal rent about half an inch in extent, the substance of the heart at this point being softened. The rent increases in size towards the cavity of the ventricle. The patient was run over by a cart and was admitted into the hospital, but no serious symptom occurred until the fifth day after the injury, when she almost suddenly died. The pericardium was found full of blood. WOUNDS, &c. 1370. Part of the Heart of a lunatic, who destroyed himself by thrusting a needle, about an inch and a quarter in length, through the anterior wall of the left ventricle : death took place four days afterwards. The needle, entering just to the left of the septum, passes obliquely upwards and to the left, and its point enters the cavity of the ventricle through the apex of the anterior fleshy column; its larger end is buried in the substance of the ventricle. The pericardium was thinly covered with lymph, and the muscular substance of the heart was in a state of fatty degeneration, which was most advanced, and attended with soften- ing of texture, in the neighbourhood of the needle.

Three aneurisms of the Coronary Artery: one is on the upper and front aspect of the right ventricle, near the origin of the pulmonary artery ; another near the apex of the heart; and a third may be seen bulging at the upper and back part of the right ventricle. The two former have been opened, and are filled with cotton wool. From a boy 7 years old. No cause was discoverable, except that there were a few atheromatous patches in the aorta and the mitral valve. There was no valvular disease. The patient died oi scarlatinal dropsy, with meningitis and pneumonia.—See Post Mortem Book, October 20 1870, Case 101. 'SERIES VTIL DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. WOUNDS OF ARTERIES. 1375. The Heart and the commencement of the large arteries of a woman, aged 25 "who died under the following circumstances:—She received a blow on the chest whereby a needle, which fastened her shawl, was driven through the second intercostal space of the right side, in its upper part, close to the border of the sternum, passing between the bone and the internal mammary artery. _ It penetrated to the extent of about two inches, and was broken off on a level with the skin No immediate effect was apparent. She came to the Hospital, and the portion of the needle which appeared firmly fixed, was extracted. When the broken end was exposed by a small incision, it was observed to move slightly with the heart's action. She was with difficulty persuaded to remain. In less than an hour she became very faint. The faintness rapidly increased, and she soon died On post-mortem examination the pericardium was found distended with blood which had separated into clot and serum, the former completely investing the heart. The blood effused amounted to nearly a pint. In the wall of the aorta is seen a minute aperture (through which the portion of the needle is passed), and near to it are two other smaller wounds, only one ot which appeared to have completely perforated the wall. They are just below the point where the pericardium is reflected, the opposite portion of which presented a corresponding aperture. No other injury could be detected. ^ 1376 The arch of the Aorta, with its large branches. Immediately beyond the origin of the left subclavian, the aorta presents a ragged laceration, involving mo?e than half its circumference. The specimen was removed from the body of a middle-ao-ed man, who, after eating some fish, complained of constant pain behind the first bone of the sternum, and every day spat up blood, which was for the most part of a bright red, but sometimes of a dark colour. He also passed a laro-e quantity of dark clotted blood by the anus, and died from exhaustion. °At the post mortem examination a sharp lance-shaped fish bone was found transfixing both the oesophagus and the arch of the aorta. It was evident that the lacerated wound of the latter had been produced by the move- ment of the vessel as it pulsated upon the point of the bone. 1377 A common Carotid Artery, into which the smaller end of a tobacco-pipe was' driven a few days before death. At the upper part of the preparation is shown a portion of a sloughing cavity, in which the wounded part of the artery is involved, and from which the external and internal carotid arteries\ tt DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 207 proceed. Below this part the canal of the artery is filled by a lar^e^sy^tilo^ extending from the wound to a ligature placed around the trunk of the common carotid. Below the ligature a similar clot fills the trunk to within half an inch of the division of the arteria innominata. XHT. 116 The patient was a young man. The tobacco pipe was accidentally driven through the tonsil into the artery at the angle of its bifurcation. He supposed that he had completely with- drawn it; but a portion of the pipe, an inch long, remained in the wound, closing the oriiice which it had made in the artery, and preventing haemorrhage. Extensive suppuration followed, in the course of which haemorrhage eusued. The trunk of the artery was tied seven days after (he accident; but haemorrhage recurred twice, and the patient died four days and a half after the application of the ligature. The case is related by Mr. Vincent, in the Medico-Ckirurgical Transactions, vol. xxix. London, 1846. Vide No. 1405. 1378. An Anterior Tibial Artery, in which a small lacerated aperture, completely penetrating its coats, was made by the sliarp end of a fragment of bone in a case of compound fracture. xiii. 49 Amputation was made necessary by the haemorrhage. 1379. A Posterior Tibial Artery and Vein, which were wounded a few days before death. The wound is transverse, and extends through only one side of each vessel. The clot of blood seen in the preparation was found adhering to both vessels: the regularly circumscribed cavity in it was situated exactly over the wound of the vessels. xiii. 65 1380. Arteries of a Leg, with portions of the surrounding Muscles, from a man in whom the peroneal artery was penetrated by a knife, which passed trans- versely into the back of the leg from the inner side. The track of the wound into the peroneal artery is shown by the piece of coloured glass. The peroneal artery is unusually large; the posterior tibial, into which a bristle has been introduced, is very small. The ligature was placed around the posterior tibial in the operation of searching for the wounded peroneal artery. xil. 99 The patient died with delirium tremens a week after the ligature of the posterior tibial. The direction of the wound led to the supposition that the posterior tibial artery was wounded : but the knife had passed in front of it and had not injured it. Vide No. 1462. RUPTURE OF ARTERIES. FROM EXTERNAL. VIOLENCE. 1381. The Heart and the arch of the Aorta of a man, aged 38 years, who was knocked down by a railway engine. The aorta is almost completely divided between the innominate and left carotid arteries. The blood which escaped had dissected up the fibrous tissues covering the great vessels, the roots of the lungs, and the front and sides of the parietal pericardium. The man lived for two hours after the accident. XII ^35 1382. An External Iliac Artery, torn completely and straight across. The torn ends of the artery are an inch apart, and are connected by a coagulum of blood. The coats of the artery are not obviously diseased. XIIL 55 The rupture was directly under Poupart's ligament. It occurred in an iniurv bv which the lower part of the femur was fractured. 1383. Portion of a Brachial Artery, which was torn straight across by external violence- xiii. 88 The patient, a gentleman, 69 years old, fell with his arm stretched out. At first he seemed little injured; but pulsation was found to have ceased in'the radial and ulnar arteries Tn a few hours the arm became enormously swollen and livid, and amputation near the shonhlpv was performed. The brachial artery sloughed after being tied in the amputation. Presented by Dr. James Billett.208 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 1384. A Brachial Artery, in which, just above its bifurcation, a division of the internal and middle coats, as complete and regular as that m specimen No. 1392, was produced by a violent crushing of the arm. The external coat remains entire, and there was no external wound. The upper border ot the internal and middle coats is simply retracted: the lower border is also incurved and had closed the canal of the artery. xm- 1385. A similar specimen; but here the artery, previous to the injury, appears to have been diseased, so that its coats were unnaturally fragile. xnL iZU 1386. A Femoral Artery, the inner and middle coats of which were lacerated in a case of compound fracture. The laceration extends transversely round two- thirds of the artery just above the origin of the profunda. The lower extremity of the artery is closed by a ligature which was placed round it a short time before death, when the limb was amputated for the other injuries sustained in the compound fracture. 1387. Portions of a Popliteal Artery and Vein. The artery was completely torn across by a wheel passing over the limb, and its divided extremities are sepa- rated to a distance of nearly half an inch. They are widely open In the upper part of the artery a coagulum is formed, which almost fills its canity . in the lower part there are only some irregularly sha.ped portions of nbrm.^ ^ FROM THE EFFECTS OF CONTIGUOUS INFLAMMATION. 1388. The arch of an Aorta, with its chief branches, part of the left lung, the larynx, trachea, oesophagus, and other adjacent structures; all _^ ?^OT^ so as to expose the inside of the aorta. The tissues m front of the trachea, and in the upper part of the mediastinum, were condensed around a large collection of pus and blood which extended nearly as low as the root of the left lung as well as far upwards in the neck by the sides of the trachea and larynx. Part of the boundary of the abscess was formed by the distal portion of the arch of the aorta, by the commencement of its thoracic portion, and by the left sub- clavian artery. The extent to which these vessels were m contact with the abscess wall is indicated by a thin layer of lymph on their outer surfaces. Half an inch beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery, at the extremity of the convexity of the arch, an obliquely directed rent, a third of an inch in length, extends right through the coats of the artery and into the cavity of fte ..bsces.

XIII. 6 1390. Portion of an Artery, exhibiting the division of its middle and internal coats by three different kinds of ligature, viz., the large round, the small round, and the flat ligature. The ligatures employed were composed of the same mate- rials as those which are tied round the portion of artery by the side of that on which the experiment was made. The small round ligature, which is in the middle, made the cleanest and most complete division of the coats; the division by the flat ligature is uneven, incomplete, and attended by partial separation of the adjacent part of the divided coats. xiii. 33 The experiment was made on a dead artery. 1391. A Femoral Artery, the coats of which have abundant earthy deposits in them, and show the effects of a ligature placed round it a few days before death. The ligature was applied at a little distance from the extremity of the artery, and it has divided the inner and middle coats. For two inches above the ligature the artery is filled by coagulum. xiii. 66 1392. A Femoral Artery and Vein.

FORMATION AND ADHESION OF COAGULUM. 1393. A left Carotid Artery, with a portion of the arch of the Aorta. A ligature was placed around the carotid artery, in the middle of its course, six weeks before death, and it had been separated without haemorrhage. A firm cylindrical clot adheres to the inside of the artery, and extends from half an inch below the situation of the ligature downwards to the aorta. A similar clot is continued upwards within the artery, from the situation of the ligature to the origin of a small branch. The extremities of the divided artery from which the lio-ature separated are soft and pulpy, and there was not in either of them the least adhesion of the opposite sides of the vessel. xiii. 82 The artery was tied in the hope of curing epilepsy in an elderly gentle man, who had found that by compressing his carotids he could avert the epileptic seizure. He died with abscess extending into the mediastinum along the sheath of the carotid and jugular vessels. 1394. A right common Carotid Artery, with the ligature surrounding it, the latter having been applied five days before death for the arrest of profuse haemorrhage from an extensive cancerous ulceration, which occupied the upper part of the neck and the internal maxillary region. Fibrinous, spiral coagula exist above and below the point ligatured. xm. 136 The patient never rallied from the effect produced by the loss of blood, but became paralyzed and sank gradually.

Iliac and Femoral Arteries, with an Aneurism at the commencement of the Femoral Artery, for the cure of which the external Iliac was tied The ligature was applied about half an inch below the division of the common iliac. The upper end of the artery is closed by a small portion of dry clot • its lower end is closed by a conical clot an inch long and closely adherent to its p210 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. walls. Between these clots is a substance connecting the extremities of the art cry divided by the ligature, which substance appeared, in the recent state, to consist of the remains of the sheath of the artery. From the clot below the situation of the ligature to within a short distance of the sac, the artery is pervious; and from this pervious part the epigastric and circumflex branches arise. Within that part of the artery which is directly above the sac, is a small conical clot completely filling its canal. The coats of the artery appeared healthy throughout. The external iliac vein is pervious to within an inch of the sac ; but there it is obliterated. The interior of the portion of the sac which is preserved is irregularly wrinkled and tuberculated, but polished as if lined by a prolongation of the internal coat of the artery. xm. 27 The patient was a man 35 years old. The aneurism extended from Poupart's ligament nearly to the knee, and almost surrounded the limb. After the ligature of the artery the limb mortified, and the patient died in the third week with symptoms of tetanus.^ The case is related by Mr. Hodgson in his " Treatise on Diseases of the Arteries and Veins," p. 198, Case XXXV. 1397. The Iliac Arteries of a man whose external iliac artery was tied four days before his death. The ligature was applied just above the origin of the epigastric branch of the artery. Above this place, where now a constriction appears, the whole canal of the artery to the origin of the iliac is filled with a firm, cylindrical blood-clot. Beyond the place of ligature, a smaller conical clot extends, for nearly an inch, along the trunk of the artery. The coats of the artery are thick and rigid, with deposits of fatty and calcareous matter. J xiii. 123 The patient, a man 55 years old, was stabbed deeply in the left groin, and lost so large a quantity of blood from the wound, that he " seemed on the point of expiring." On the fol- lowing day, when he bad in some measure recovered from the effects of the loss of blood, no pulsation could be felt in the left femoral artery, till near the middle of the limb; below this part and in the arteries of the leg, the pulse was very feeble; while in the arteries of the right lower extremity it was distinct. The difference was probably due to the diseased state of the left iliac artery, narrowing its calibre; but, added to the large loss of blood, it seemed to iustify the operation for ligature of the main artery. No wound of any large vessel could, however, be found ; and it appeared most probable that the bleeding bad proceeded from the The case is related in a Clinical Lecture by Sir Wm. Lawrence, in the Medical Times and Gazette, July 2nd, 1853. 1398. The Femoral Artery from the body of a man who died eleven days after amputation at the thigh.

The left common Carotid Artery, with some of its branches and the greater portion of the corresponding tonsil, from a man aged 24 years. The artery was tied at the part where it is crossed by theOmo-hyoid muscle two months before death on account of haemorrhage from the tonsil, the result of an operation. The canal is completely obliterated at the point where the artery has been tied. The outer and middle coats of the vessel, for some distance both above and below, are much thickened. The inner coat above the ligature has a natural aspect, but below it appears to have been partially destroyed. Beyond the ligature to its point of bifurcation the canal is occupied by a mottled, softening clot; below it was filled with loose shreds of fibrin, fluid blood, and dark coagula. A bristle is passed through a small aperture in the wall which com- municated with the external wound, not completely closed, and from which slight haemorrhage occurred four days before death. Twenty-four hours before death the patient became hemiplegic and comatose. In the left hemisphere several portions of the brain were softened and diffluent. No branch of unusual size could be traced into the tonsil, which presented a natural appearance. xiii. 145 1406. Portion of an Aorta with the External Iliac, Femoral, and Popliteal Arteries. There was an aneurism of the popliteal artery, on account of which the femoral was tied three weeks before death. The popliteal artery is not dilated, but it presents a large aperture in its coats, apparently the result of ulceration m the situation over which the aneurism was seated A ligature was placed around the femoral artery an inch and a half below the origin of the profunda, and had separated before death. A firm cylindrical coalulum fills the artery between the situation of the ligature and the orifice of the profunda. The divided ends of the artery are united by dense fibrous tissue, but are not closed. Between the ligature and the aperture in the poplitea artery there are several small deposits of soft yellow substance in the coats of the artery; these increase m the lower part of the artery; the whole of iU internal coat also is transversely wrinkled. xtn gj? Presented by J. G. Perry, Esq. P 2212 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. OBLITERATION OF A PORTION OF AN ARTERY AFTER LIGATURE IN CONTINUITY. 1407. The Femoral and Popliteal Arteries, with a Popliteal Aneurism. The femoral artery was tied by the edge of the sartorius muscle eighteen months before death, and the aneurism was diminishing at the time of the patient's death. The femoral artery is completely obliterated from the situation at which the ligature was applied to the origin of the profunda. An inch and a half of the length of this part of the artery is replaced by a solid round cord of tough fibro-cellular tissue. Between the cord and the origin of the profunda is a firm, dry, rust-coloured clot of blood, filling and adhering to the coats of the artery. Below the cord is a similar clot half an inch in length, the lower end of which is continued into a milk-white thin layer, like the buffy coat of a clot of blood, which Hues the whole length of the rest of the artery down to the aneurismal sac, and is, in its course, connected with three other decolorised clots closely attached to the arterial walls. Part of this layer has been reflected : the rest was too intimately adherent to the artery to be separated without tearing it: the coats of the part of the artery which it lines appear healthy. The mouth of the aneurismal sac is very long and narrow ; both it and the whole cavity of the sac are filled by firm, dry, laminated coagulum. The walls of the sac are thick and tuberculated : they appear to have been formed by dilatation of about one-third of the circumference of a portion of the artery an inch and a half in length. xin. 114 The patient was a man between 50 and 60 years old. He died with aneurism of the arch of the aorta, and abscess of the lung. 1408. A Femoral Artery, upon which a ligature was placed a considerable time before death. The canal of the artery above and below the obliterated part is gradually contracted into a conical form as it approaches that part. The upper and lower portions of the vessel are connected by condensed fibrous tissue. For some way above and below the obliterated part, the coats of the artery are thickened, and in the upper portion a dry clot of blood is firmly adherent to the walls. ™. 23 Vide No. 1411.

In consequence of the occurrence of hasrnorrhage after the amputation, a second ligature was placed around the artery, about two inches above its extremity. This ligature had separated before death; and a portion of whalebone is passed into the aperture through which it was withdrawn. The cavity of the artery, above and below the situation of this ligature, is filled by partially decolorised blood clot, which extends to a con- siderable distance up the vessel. The cut end of the artery is open. xiii. 40 For other specimens, vide Nos. 1463, 1512, 1543, 1546. RE-LIGATION OF ARTERIES FOR SECONDARY HAEMORRHAGE AFTER LIGATURE IN CONTINUITY. 1414. The Femoral Vessels from the right Scarpa's Triangle, showing the point where the artery was ligatured for a popliteal aneurism, and subsequently, above and below the first ligature, for secondary hemorrhage. The wound had healed on the surface; the two ligatures placed upon the artery for secondary haemor- rhage protruded through two small fistulous tracks. On cutting through the scar a small abscess cavity containing ichorous pus was found lying over the vessels ; through this cavity the ligatures passed. Between the two ligatures the artery is contracted, and its walls are thickened and infiltrated; the intima is soft and friable, and the vessel here contains no clot. In the centre of this portion of the vessel, the point where the first ligature was applied is seen; the artery was here divided when the other ligatures were applied, but has since united. Above the upper ligature the vessel contains a clot about one inch and a quarter long, which diminishes in size towards its upper extremity. The part of the clot immediately above the ligature is pale and adherent to the wall of the vessel; the remainder of the clot is very loosely adherent, friable, and not decolorised. Below the distal ligature there is a small clot about a quarter of an inch long, which is less adherent and more friable; a fine filament extends from its apex some distance along the vessel. The lining of the vein is stained; its canal was patent. A clot partially fills the upper third; it is moderately firmly adherent to the vessel, partially decolorised, and its rounded lower extremity is situated behind the cusp of a valve : a similar though much smaller clot about a quarter of an inch long, extends upwards from the valve next below : at this point a large vein, which is filled by a clot, opens into the femoral vein; the conical end of this clot projects slightly into the lumen of the vessel. No injury appears to have been done to the vein in the passage of the aneurism needle. ° The specimen was taken from a man, aged 48 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with a popliteal aneurism, which had existed seven months. He had been treated in a provincial hospital, where alter the application of pressure to the femoral artery, the aneurism solidified but pulsation returned soon after the discontinuance of the treatment. The aneurism again solidified after the employment of the same treatment, but as before the clot melted away and pulsation returned. The femoral artery was then ligatured, and the aneurism consolidated une month after the operation, secondary hreniorrhage commenced beneath the scar of the wound, which bad closed around the ligature. The wound was laid open, and the vessel again ligatured above and below the first ligature. The patient died of pyaemia a fortnight after this operation.

XIII. 1 1427. Portion of an Aorta, in which a great quantity of atheromatous material is deposited beneath the lining coat. In places this has been converted into cal- careous plates. Elsewhere it has softened, and the inner membrane having given way, irregular, and, as it were, worm-eaten cavities have resulted. These were tilled partly by broken-down atheromatous material, and partly by shreds of fibrin, probably deposited from the blood.

ULCERATION EXTENDING INTO ARTERIES FROM ABSCESSES, etc. 1439. A portion of the Abdominal Aorta and the adjacent soft parts. The vessel is laid open along its front aspect. In its posterior wall is an orifice four lines in diameter, filled with granular coagulum. On the opposite side of the specimen it may be seen that this coagulum is a portion of a mass as large as a hen's egg, occupying a cavity behind the aorta, and bounded by condensed areolar tissue. The patient from whom the specimen was taken was a man, aged 28 years, who was admitted into the Hospital with a large psoas abscess and acute bronchitis. He died in three days. On examination the abscess was found distended with a mixture of pus, and in large amount, recently effused blood. The sac of the abscess communicated with the aorta, but, as niav be seen, tlie orifice connecting them was in great part closed by coagulum. The abscess was associated with caries of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae.—Abernethy Ward Book, vol. i, p. 80. 1440. The Arch of an Aorta, and the large vessels arising from it. The inner wall of a cavity formed of condensed connective tissue is seen; the cavity extended along the left side of the neck from the clavicle to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle. The ragged ends of the left common carotid artery project into the cavity above and below; they are separated from each other one and a half to two inches. Corresponding portions of the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve, where they passed through the cavity, are destroyed. The orifices of the vessels are filledDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 217 with clot. The left subclavian and left brachiocephalic veins are obliterated where they lie in contact with the wall of the cavity. From a man, a<*ed 31 years, who was said to have liad a swelling on the left side of the neck for two years. Three days before his admission to the Hospital there was bleeding from an open- ing in the neck, which was controlled by pads. On admission, after the removal of the pads, a gush of blood took place from an opening at the lower part of the left side of the neck. The cavity with wldch the opening communicated was exposed by an incision, and—as the bleeding vessel could not be secured—it was plugged with lint soaked in perchloride of iron. The patient died on the fourth day after the operation, but the bleeding did not recur. The vessels were probably ulcerated through by the formation of a chronic glandular abscess in the neck.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 263. 1441. The external Iliac and Femoral Vessels of the right side. A mass of indurated tissue containing enlarged lymphatic glands is seen surrounding the femoral vessels. In the middle of this mass is an abscess cavity, through which the femoral artery and vein pass. In the recent state it was large enough to contain a small orange, and was filled with blood clot, which was firm and laminated around the walls. Three openings in the integument covering Scarpa's triangle led into the abscess. The distal end of the femoral vein opens abruptly into the abscess cavity:, a glass rod is placed within it. About an inch of this vessel is completely destroyed. The proximal end is filled by a firm blood clot, which extends three or four inches up the vessel. No blood clot was found in the distal end. A small vertical opening with ragged edges is seen on the inner side of the femoral artery where it lay in contact with the abscess cavity. There is also a linear opening about two lines long below this. The external coat is dissected up from that portion of the vessel which lies within the abscess cavity. A silk ligature is seen around the external iliac artery half an inch above the origin of the epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries. The specimen was taken from a man, aged 36. In March he contracted gonorrhoea; a slight indolent swelling of the glands in the right groin occurred, and, although the discharge ceased in a few weeks, the glandular enlargement remained. In November an abscess formed, and discharged itself. On the 29th of this month hemorrhage occurred from one of the openings communicating with the abscess cavity. The bleeding recurred almost daily until December 4th, when he was admitted to the Hospital. There was an ill-defined swelling in the right Scarpa's triangle, which was found to have distensile pulsation and a systolic bruit. Three ulcerated openings over the swelling were filled with blood. On the night of December 5th a gush of dark blood, which escaped in jets, took place from one of the openings. The external iliac artery was shortly after ligatured. The patient showed no signs of rallying, and died next morning.—See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. v, p. 87. This, and the case from which the preceding specimen, No. 1440, was taken, are described by Mr. Savory, in the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, vol. Ixir, 1881. 1442. A Femoral Artery and Vein, which were exposed and partly destroyed in the progress of a phagedsenic ulcer. The coats of the artery, to the extent of about an inch, are completely disorganised, and two small ragged openino-s are visible in this portion of the vessel. Above this part of the artery a circular indentation in its walls may be perceived, which was occasioned by a ligature placed around it in consequence of haemorrhage from the openings just men- tioned. A portion of the vein is obliterated, and its cavity below the obliterated part is filled by a clot of blood. XIII The disease extended from the labia of a woman, and had destroyed a large portion of the perineum before it reached the groin. 1443.

A portion of the gland may be seen in the preparation. 1444. Femoral Vessels in Scarpa's Triangle and adjacent parts, from a male, aged 18 years, admitted into the Hospital October 16th, 1808. He was then suffer- ing from a small ulcerated and sloughing bubo in the left groin below Poupart's ligament. From time to time there was slight venous oozing from the groin, but not sufficient at first to excite any apprehension. About November 28th the venous bleeding became more considerable, and on two occasions was severe. On December 8th a gush of blood came from the wound, and a second bleeding followed on the 9th, after which the boy sank rapidly and died. The preparation shows that the ulcerative process has extended into the femoral vein, destroying about one inch of its length. Just where the common femoral artery divides into its deep and superficial branches, a circular opening about two lines in diameter leads into its canal, and from this the fatal bleedings no doubt proceeded. 1445. External Iliac, Femoral and Profunda Arteries. A small clot occupies the first-named vessel above the point at which a ligature had been applied. The profunda exhibits a small ulcerated aperture, through which a bristle is passed. These appearances are connected with the following history. xin. 154 The patient, a man, aged 35 years, noticed one day a considerable and somewhat painful swelling on the upper part of the left thigh, which from this tune increased steadily in size. The tumour, of a doubtful character throughout, was associated with occasional absence of pulsation in the tibial arteries. After an exploratory puncture some dark fluid blood escaped; and, in the belief that it was a blood-tumour connected with some diseased and ruptured artery (the correctness of which opinion was decided by the post-mortem examination), a h>ature was placed round the external iliac artery on the twenty-sixth day. Foetid decom- position of the tumour-contents ensued, and the patient, falling into a typhoid condition, died on the thirty-first day. Vide No. 1388, also Nos. 1791 and 1801-in Series XII. GENERAL DILATATION OF ARTERIES. 1446. The Arch and Thoracic portion of an Aorta uniformly dilated. The coats of the artery are generally thickened and indurated.

A Heart, with the large Vessels attached to it, exhibiting a general dilata- tion of the Pulmonary Artery with a diseased state of its coats. Beneath the linino- membrane of the artery there is a deposit of a white and soft substance, giving to the internal surface of the vessel a tuberculated appearance, which is especially marked in the right branch of the artery. The trunk of the pulmonary artery, from the valves to the bifurcation, is uniformly dilated; but its coats appear nearly healthy. Both the right and left pulmonary arteries are dilated- and in one of the divisions of the left artery, which is more dilated than the rest, there is a deposit of firm fibrin, neai'ly rilling the cavity of the dilated part. One of the divisions of the right pulmonary artery was in a similar state. The cavity of the right ventricle is dilated, and its walls are thickened. Beneath the lining of the aorta is a deposit of the same kind as that in the pulmonary artery, but less abundant. xm. 90 The patient was a woman 53 years old. She had emphysema of the lungs, and chronic bronchitis, the signs of which concealed in great measure those of the disease of the pulmonary artery.219 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 1449.

Its inner coat is variously thickened, and its surface roughened or nodulated from the presence of an extensive atheromatous deposit. In addition to the general dilatation, many smaller sacculi give an irregular appearance to the walls. Over some of the rough points seen on the lining membrane, fibrin had been deposited, and projected, shred-like, into the sac ; the fibres were easily detached, merely clinging to the surface. The valve has been closed by sutures to indicate how it still sufficed to occlude the aortic orifice in spite of its dilatation, the cusps being stretched and extended to compensate for that change.—See Hospital Reports, vol. xvi, P- 45. XIII. 130 1451. A Fusiform Aneurismal Dilatation of the whole length of the ascending por- tion of the Arch of the Aorta.

Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, exhibiting a large Aneurismal Sac, with a wide oval mouth, projecting from one side of the artery, and formed entirely by the dilatation of its coats. A soft white substance is deposited in irregular patches beneath the inner membrane of both the sac and the arterial walls. xin. 81 1459. A Femoral Artery, the seat of Aneurism. The sac, occupying the whole iuguinal portion of the artery, extends from the origin of the epigastric and circumflex iliac branches to the profunda. It is formed by a dilatation of about half the circumference of a portion of the artery an inch long. The coats of the artery, thickened by deposits of soft substance, opaque, and indurated, may be traced for some way upon the inside of the sac. In the rest of its extent the sac appears to be formed by condensed cellular tissue ; and its surface, at its upper part, is covered by thick laminated coagulum. Bristles are introduced into the orifices of the epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries. In the lower part of the sac are two distinct orifices, one leading to the femoral artery, the other to the profunda. The femoral vein, to the extent of two inches, is obliterated by the pressure of the aneurism. Below the obliterated part the vein is laid open to show the clots of fibrin filling its cavity. Kill. 83 1460. Aneurism of the Popliteal Artery. It is situated on the anterior part of the vessel, so that it lay between the latter and the back part of the lower end of the femur. At the upper part of the aneurism, just where it begins to expand from the trunk of the artery, is a small rent. From a man, aged 46 years, who had suffered from occasional pain in the calf of the leg with slight swelling'for many months, but though the limb was several times carefully examined, no aneurism could be detected. At last it was attacked by sudden and acute pain, followed by rapidly increasing swelling and pulsation in the popliteal space. A few days later the limb was amputated through the thigh. The popliteal space and adjacent parts were found distended with blood, which had escaped from the rent pointed out.

There appears to have been a complete rupture of the whole circumference of the artery, so that the sac is formed entirely by the surrounding cellular tissue. Above and below the aneurism the artery appears to be healthy; its coats terminate abruptly at the boundaries of the sac. The sac is almost filled by laminated coagulum. The popliteal vein is pervious, but flattened by the pressure of the sac. xm. 24 Tide Nos. 1509, 1514, 1545. ANEURISMAL VARIX. 1462. Portion of a left Petrous Bone, with which are connected the left carotid arteries and other adjacent parts. The common carotid artery, laid open from be- hind, is large, and, with the exception of slight fatty degeneration, is of healthy texture; the internal carotid is normal; the external carotid is large from its origin, and just after giving off its lingual branch, it becomes thin-walled, much larger, and'very tortuous. Its canal, from this point to its final division, is nearly half an inch in diameter and about two inches in length. At the upper part of this, its tortuous and dilated portion, there is an aperture of communication between the external carotid artery and the upper part of the internal jugular vein; the vessels being brought into unnatural proximity at one of the curves of the artery. The aperture (through which a bristle is passed) is oval and nearlyDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 221 two lines in its chief diameter. Its direction is from above downwards, and from without inwards. Its borders are prominent and thickened towards the canal of the vein, and all the tissues close round it are condensed and indurated; a little further away they all appear healthy. On the wall of the vein, immediately opposite to this aperture, and about three-quarters of an inch below the jugular fossa, a brownish discoloration appears beneath the lining membrane; it is due to the rust of a wedge-shaped piece of iron there imbedded. The piece of iron is exposed, on the other side, by laying open a cavity in which it lies, with all the surrounding tissues closely applied on it, and blackened by its rust and little particles of soil. It is about one-third of an inch in length, and one- quarter of an inch in width at its widest part; its sharper end is directed towards the vein, and is separated from the canal of the vein by the internal coat alone: the pneumogastric, hypoglossal, and spinal accessory nerves are all in close contact with it; it seems, even, to be within the neurolemma of the pneumogastric nerve. The cervical part of the sympathetic nerve is clear from it, but was adherent to the scar-like tissue which enclosed the iron, and in which all the other nerves were almost inseparably imbedded. XIII. 121 The patient was a middle-aged man, and his death was independent of the injury here shown. The injury was received twelve years before death. The piece of iron, broken from the point of a pick-axe, penetrated through the side of the neck. Severe haemorrhage ensued, but the wound healed without difficulty. A loud whizzing sound, and strong vibration, were always perceptible over the swelling produced by the dilated artery. VARICOSE ANEURISM. 1463. The External Iliac, Femoral, and Popliteal Arteries, with the femoral and popliteal veins, exhibiting a spontaneous varicose aneurism of the femoral artery and vein, and part of an aneurism of the posterior tibial artery. The upper piece of glass in the lower aneurismal sac is passed through the posterior tibial artery. The two lower pieces of glass are passed through the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, both of which are continued from the lower part of the aneurism. The aneurism of the femoral artery is situated just before its passage through the tendon of the adductor magnus muscle: it is a small globular sac, formed by dilatation of the whole circum- ference of the artery. Earthy matter is deposited in the parietes of this aneurism, and it communicates directly with the femoral vein. The interior of the vein presents a rounded opening, with thin and smooth edges, about a quarter of an inch in diameter. Around this opening the vein is closely united to the aneurism, and immediately below it the cavity of the vein is obliterated to the extent of half an inch. A ligature had been placed around the femoral artery about a week before death. Immediately above the ligature is a large irregular opening in the artery, from which fatal haemorrhage took place. Around this opening, and both above and below the ligature, the whole length of the artery is uniformly dilated to the size of an abdominal aorta, and its coats are very thin. XIII The patient was a man 47 years old. The aneurism of the posterior tibial arterv had pro- bably existed more than four year?, that of the femoral artery about two years *The most striking sign of the disease was a peculiar purring thrill which was felt along the whole course of the femoral artery, both during its pulsations and in the intervals between them but which could be stopped by pressure on the varicose aneurism. Long-continued pressure on this part produced, it was behoved, the obliteration of the vein about six months before the patient's death. The ligature was applied to the femoral artery shortly after a sudden increase had taken place m the aneurism of the posterior tibial artery. The patient died with hamiorrhatre on the sixth day after the operation. The case is described by Mr. Perry in the Medico Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xx, p. 32. London, 1837. Presented by J. G.

A transverse rent extends through the inner and middle coats of the whole circumference of the aorta, about half anDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 222 inch above the angles of the valves. The blood, penetrating between the coats at the torn part, has thence extended and separated the layers of the middle coat through a large portion of the arch and thoracic part of the aorta. Where the coats are thus separated the trunks of the intercostal arteries are torn across close to their origins. The inner coat of the artery appears opaque, and, in the thoracic portion, it is tuberculated by deposits of soft matter beneath its surface. The aortic and mitral valves are slightly opaque. The left ventricle of the heart is dilated and hypertrophied. xni. 110 The patient was a woman about 45 years old. Her pulse was generally strong and full, but she was considered perfectly bealthy. As sbe was carrying two pails of water she suddenly fell down and almost instantly expired. Two pints of blood were found in the pericardium, which had probably escaped through some aperture in the external coat of the aorta, not shown in the preparation. Presented by H. Page, Esq. 1465. The Base of a Heart, with the Arch and Thoracic portions of the Aorta. About half an inch above the valves there is an oblique rent about an inch long, extending through the inner and part of the middle coat of the aorta. The mar- gins of the rent are soft and ragged. The blood passing through it has extended between the layers of the middle coat of the artery through the whole length and the greater portion of the circumference of the aorta, separating them and tearing across the intercostal and other small arteries. Some of the blood, coao-ufated, remains in the channel which it has formed for itself between the coats of the artery. The inner and middle coats of the aorta were soft, succu- lent, and very easily torn in any direction; its internal surface also appears shreddy by the partial detachment of little portions of the inner coat. The aortic valves are healthy, but the heart was generally enlarged. xm. Ill The patient was a gentleman, 45 years old, who was subject to occasional attacks of rheu- matism While suffering with colic he was seized with syncope, which was shortly followed by si«ms of internal hemorrhage, and he died on the fourth day, The pulmonary artery was found to°be compressed by the blood effused in the coats of the aorta. There was abundant soft deposit in the coats of the coronary arteries and the pericardium was full of blood. Presented by Dr. Theophilus Thompson. 1466. The Abdominal Aorta of the same patient, showing the further separation of its coats by the effused blood. The separation extends to the origin of the renal arteries.

Parts of a Heart and Aorta, exhibiting a transverse rent extending round the whole circumference of the inner and middle coats of the aorta, about half an inch above the valves. The characters of this specimen closely resemble those of No 1464. The torn coats are soft, but in other respects they appear healthy. xm- 113 The patient was a man about 25 years old. He had delicate health, but was not supposed to have any disease of the heart. He was suddenly seized, while walking, with pain m the chest and faintness, and quickly died. • Presented by Dr. Jeailreson. 1468. A Heart and adjacent parts, showing a transverse rent through the inner coats of the aorta about one inch above the semilunar valves: the rent extends, with the exception of one inch, completely around the vessel. The external coat is stripped off to some extent from the inner coats, and blood found its way through a small rent into the cavity of the pericardium, which contained two pints of blood-clot. About one-third of an inch above the large rent in the aorta is a small one about half an inch broad. The aorta was elastic and not atheromatous, but the part torn was extremely thin. Two of the cusps of the aortic valve are so completely adherent as to give the appearance of the existenceDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 223 of but two cusps; they are thickened and studded on their inner surface with calcareous plates. The mitral valves are much thickened, adherent, partially covered by an irregular calcareous mass, and the orifice only admits the tip of one finger. The valves on the right side are normal. The heart is hypertrophied to a moderate degree, and the left auricle is greatly dilated. The specimen was taken from a man, aged 59 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with symptoms of morbus cordis, from which be had suffered for six months. No history of a "* strain " or severe work was obtained. There was a systolic murmur at the apex, a systolic murmur at the base conducted along the large arteries, and a diastolic murmur in the same situation. The patient died suddenly, a few days after his admission.—See Mark Ward Book, vol. viii, p. 207, and Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 140. 1469. A dissecting Aneurism of an Aorta, which is obliterated at the point where it is joined by the ductus arteriosus. The heart is small but there is considerable concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. There are only two cusps to the aortic valve, and the commencement of the aorta is enormously dilated. About half an inch above the semilunar valves is a transverse rent in the inner coats of the aorta about an inch long: a finger inserted through which passes into a large cavity between the outer and middle coats of the artery. The aortic arch gives off four branches, the first and second being the innominate and left carotid ; the third a ramifying artery to the neck ; the last,—the left subclavian,— arising immediately above the obliteration. The arch and all its branches are dilated and atheromatous. Below the obliterated spot the aorta is at first conical, but soon is expanded to its normal diameter. The intercostal arteries are largely dilated. The ductus arteriosus is ligamentous. A small glass rod has been passed through a valvular opening immediately below the obliteration into a minute canal in the duct, which has been laid open; it did not com- municate with the pulmonary artery. The pericardium is turned back with the thymus (which was persistent) still attached. The cavity of the pericardium was found filled with coagulated and fluid blood. There is a vertical rent about half an inch long through the outer coat of the intra-pericardial portion of the aorta, which leads into the cavity between the coats spoken of above, and is almost opposite the rent through the inner coats. The separation of the coats extends almost around the aorta as high as the origin of the innominate. The innominate, right carotid, and subclavian arteries are stained with blood which was extravasated into their sheaths. Both internal mammary arteries were much enlarged. The parts were taken from a man, aged 20 years, who was brought dead to the Hospital, having been found in the streets by the police.—See Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxix, p. 65.

From a man aged 44 years.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. viii, p. 52. 1473. The commencement of an Aorta, with part of the pulmonary artery and of the right and left ventricles of the heart. The aorta is the seat of exten- sive atheromatous deposits, and its inner surface is thus rendered rough and uneven. Its canal is irregularly dilated by numerous pouches of varying size. One of these projects into the right ventricle, below the attachment of the pulmonary valves; its position is indicated by the bristle. Opposite this pouch, just above one of the aortic cusps, there is a fissure with uneven flocculent edges, its base formed by the middle coat of the aorta, covered with soft, atheromatous deposits. In the recent state this fissure was filled by a softer, almost pus-like material, which contained a large quantity of free oil. To the right of this fissure is a long crack, extending downwards to the base of the valve; on either side of it the wall of the aorta is thickened and puckered. Above, its edges are undermined ; but here, as elsewhere, its surface is covered by a transparent membrane having an imperfectly filamentous struc- ture. xm- 132 1474. Portion of a Heart and an Aorta. The aorta is generally dilated, and there are two circumscribed dilatations immediately above the valves. The larger, to the right of the specimen, projects into the commencement of the pulmonary artery, one of the valves of which is adherent to the projecting surface. 1475. The Arch of an Aorta, with a broad flat aneurism, which, arising from its antei'ior wall just above the valves, has compressed, and burst into the pul- monary artery. The internal coat of the aorta is irregularly thickened: the mouth of the sac is round and very wide. xin. 14 1476. The Arch of an Aorta, with its great branches and the Pulmonary Artery. The whole of the arch is somewhat dilated, and soft matter is deposited in its coats. A small hemispherical aneurismal pouch extends from the aorta just above the rio-ht semilunar valve, compresses the pulmonary artery, and communicates with it by an opening, through which a portion of glass is passed. Imme- diate! v around this opening the coats of the pulmonary artery are thickened. xm. 102 1477. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Pulmonary Artery. The aorta is con- siderably and uniformly dilated in the whole extent of the arch. Its coats are thickened and tuberculated; and, just above one of the semilunar valves there is a small opening which extends through the coats of the aorta into the con- tiguous portion of the pulmonary artery. There is no greater dilatation of the aorta in the situation of this opening than in any other part. xm. 87 1478. An Aorta, with an aneurism of the first portion of its arch, which has burst into the poricardium. The sac, which is of an oval form, has extended across the front of the aorta between it and the pulmonary artery, and has compressed the latter. The mouth of the sac is round, and is situated in the front wall of the aorta, just above the aortic valves. A quill is introduced from the sac through the ruptured aperture, above which a portion of the pericardium is reflected from the sac. The internal coat of the aorta is thick- ened and tuberculated, especially near the margin of the mouth of the aneurismal sac. Fibrin is deposited on the inner surface of the pulmonary artery, where it is pressed upon by the sac.

Two small aneurisms have formed upon the first portion of the arch of the aorta, and project into the pericardium, one above, and the other by the right side of the trunk of the pulmonary artery. Portions of coloured glass are passed from the aorta into both the anenrismal sacs. The lower and larger of them, which opens into the aorta about half an inch above the valves, has been laid open : it is nearly filled by dark laminated fibrinous coagula. The smaller sac is nearly empty. The lining membrane of all the first portion of the aorta is thickened, uneven, and opaque white: small quantities of fatty matter are deposited in and beneath it. The aortic valves are thickened, opaque, rigid, and reduced in breadth. xm. iqq 1482.

The Arch of an Aorta, with an Aneurism of its upper part and right side, involving the arteria innominata. A very firm and thick laminated coagulum lines the sac, and lias closed the origin of the right subclavian artery. A portion of the coagulum was found detached and almost loose in the cavity of the aorta, as it now appears in the preparation. The trachea is slightly com- pressed by the aneurism. xm 69 _ The patient, an elderly man, was supposed to have chronic asthma, the signs of which increased to such a degree that the trachea was opened to prevent the suffocation which seemed impending. A large thyroid vein was opened in the operation, and the patient died. 1484. A Heart, with an Aneurism extending from the commencement to the termination of the arch of the aorta. The sac is of immense size; its lower part is formed by the dilated aorta; but at the upper part its walls are appa- rently formed by condensed cellular tissue, and exhibit small laminated deposits of fibrin upon their inner surface. The front and upper part of the sac has been turned upwards, with three ribs belonging to the right side of the chest and a part of the sternum, closely attached to it. There is a small fissure in the side o the sac near its upper part, through which blood escaped into the pleura. I he heart is healthy; but the pericardium is generally adherent to it.

The dilatation begins directly above the valves, and terminates abrnptly just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. The interior of the sac is very unevenly tuberculated: it contains no coagulum, and has burst into the pulmonary artery. xm- 15 The patient was a man, 45 years old. While apparently in good health, he was seized with pain in the chest, dyspnoea, and intermittent pulse, and died in eighteen hours. 1486. The Arch of an Aorta, with a very large aneurism projecting through the front of the chest. The aorta is uniformly dilated, except in the formation of the aneurismal sac. The mouth of the aneurism is oval, about an inch and a half in its chief and vertical diameter; its lower border is about three-quarters of an inch above the free edge of the aortic valves; the whole border is smoothly rounded, as if by the eversion of the internal arterial coat; and the adjacent walls of the artery appear not more diseased than are other parts. From this, the mouth of its sac, the aneurism extends nearly straight forwards through a large aperture formed by absorption of the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and of the right side of the sternum. The aneurism, quickly enlarging beyond its mouth, is cylindriform, about five and a halt inches in diameter, but narrowed at the part included within the aperture m the walls of the chest. A section through the aneurism shows that its walls are from one to two lines in thickness, tough and irregularly laminated ; but their component textures cannot be discerned. They are very closely adherent to the tissues bounding the aperture in the walls of the chest, and to a part of the right lung. With the exception of a small part immediately adjacent to its mouth, the whole cavity of the aneurism is filled with tough, and, for the most part, firmly com- pacted layers of decolorised blood clot. xm- 124 In October, 1846, the patient, a publican, 47 years old, began to suffer with sharp spasmodic pain in the chest. In the six months following he had cough and mucous expectoration. In May, 1847, a strongly pulsating swelling appeared at the right breast. This gradually enlarged, and in October, 1847, had increased to the extent of destroying parts of the second, third, and fourth ribs on the right side. Other signs of aneurism of the aorta were well marked, lne patient kept his bed, and took only small quantities of light food, but the swelling, dyspnoea, venous congestion, and other symptoms still increased. At the end of 1847, however the disease, apparently, ceased to make progress ; the external swelling did not enlarge and slowly became much firmer; its pulsations diminished in force, and, by the end of March, 1848 were hardly perceptible. The patient during this time became pale, emaciated, and very feeble, needing better diet, and stimulants. He had kept his bed for six months, but now moved about in a chair Improvement still continuing, the tumour became at length pulseless, hard, and incompressible. In this state lie lived to the summer of 1852, when, after exposure to excite- ment and less prudent living, he died with suppurative pleuritis. The heart was small and flabby ; its muscular substance pale and friable ; and the walls ot both ventricles were scarcely more than half their natural thickness. ' Presented by Richard Evans, Esq. 1487. Part of an Aorta, with an Aneurism at the commencement of the Arch. The sac has extended forwards through the sternum and ribs on each side, and, elevating the pectoral muscles, has formed a large tumour upon the chest. A portion of skin attached to the front of the tumour indicates, by its white appearance, that the process of sloughing has commenced in its centre. The sac in its progress towards the sternum, has extended itself on each side into the' lung. A portion of the sac in the right lung is laid open, and is filled by laminated coagulum.

Part of an Aorta, with an aneurism arising from its descending portion. Its walls, extensively diseased, are irregularly dilated. This preparation shows that the aneurism in its origin consists of a dilatation of all the coats. 4y From the collection of J. R.

The sac has extended into the bodies of the vertebras, and has burst by a large sloughing aperture into the oesophagus. The coats of the artery are greatly thickened and generally dilated, and its inner coat is tuberculated with opaque, white, elevated patches. xrCL 58 1505. Aneurism of the Aorta as it passes through the diaphragm. A bristle is inserted into the fissure by which it burst into the mediastinum and injected the cellular tissue around the oesophagus. The clots in the mediastinum are supported by the diaphragm. The vertebras formed the back of the sac. ^ From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D.229 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. INNOMINATE ARTERY. 1506. The Arch of an Aorta with its branches, an aneurism of the arteria innomi- nata, and the adjacent parts. The aorta is scarcely above the natural size: but its internal coat is thickened, opaque, tuberculated, and contains some fatty and calcareous matter. The whole length of the arteria innominata is dilated anteriorly into an aneurism of unequal, rounded shape, from three to four inches in its diameter, thick-walled, and partially filled with firm blood-clot. The right carotid is much narrowed in the first inch of its course, by the compres- sion of the aneurism, and by thickening of its own walls. The undilated posterior wall of the innominate artery is similarly thickened. The pneumogas- tric trunk and its recurrent branch are closely adherent to the exterior of tbe aneurismal sac; and the former was much compressed between it and the clavicle. xm. 125 The patient was 39 years old. He had first noticed the swelling three months before his death. 1507. Part of the Arch of an Aorta, with its large vessels, exhibiting an Aneurism of the Arteria Innominata pressing upon the trachea. The sac appears to be formed by dilatation of the whole circumference of a part of the artery, and contains laminated coagulum, the deposit of which has extended across the orifice of the right carotid artery, so as completely to close it. The canal of the trachea is slightly narrowed by the pressure of the aneurism. xm. 18 The patient was a girl, aged 20 years. For a fortnight before her death she was subject to paroxysms of dyspnoea, and in one of these she died. The case is related by Mr. Lawrence, in the Medico-Chirwrgical Transactions, vol. vi, p. 227. London, 1815. COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 1508. A Carotid Artery, with a large Aneurism at its division. The sac is globular and completely filled by layers of coagulum loosely connected. A portion of straw is passed through the narrow opening of communication between the sac and the artery. Around the opening the coats of the artery are thickened and rough ; below it they appear quite healthy, but the canal of the artery is diminished by the pressure of the aneurism. The external and internal carotid arteries are pervious. The pneumogastric nerve is exposed above and below the aneurism; in the intermediate space it could not be traced on the sac- xm. 43 1509. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Innominate and right Carotid Arteries. There is an aneurism of the carotid artery, about half an inch below its division for the cure of which a ligature was applied. A section of the aneurismal sac shows its cavity contracted and filled by layers of coagulum. A portion of straw is passed through the narrow opening of communication between the sac and the artery. The place where the artery was tied is marked by a portion of straw, which is introduced into the channel leading to the artery from which the ligature was withdrawn. Below the situation of the ligature, the artery is filled by a large clot of blood, extending nearly to the division of the innomi- nate. Above the situation of the ligature the coats of the artery are thickened, and lymph is deposited upon its internal surface; a fibrinous adherent clot extends upwards to the division of the carotid into the external and internal branches, both of which are pervious. The coats of the aorta are thickened and tuberculated. xm 23 The patient was a man, aged 52 years. The aneurism had been observed for a month and appeared to be the result of an injury of the neck. He died in the fifth week after the opera- tion, with suppuration in the artery above, and in the tissues round the sac. The case is described by Mr. Vincent, in the Medico-Chirwrgical Transactions, vol. x, p. 212. Ltmdon 1510. The Arch of an Aorta, with the large Arteries proceeding from it, and anDISEASES AXD INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 230 Aneurism of the right Carotid Artery. The aneurism involves a portion of the common carotid, with the commencement of the external and internal carotid arteries. The sac is filled by firm coagulum. About an inch below the sac, a ligature was placed around the artery, and had not separated at the time of death. Between the ligature and the aneurism, as well as between the ligature and the origin of the subclavian artery, the whole cavity of the carotid is filled by coagulum, which adheres firmly to its sides. The aorta presents a tuber- culated appearance upon its internal surface from the thickening of its inner coat and the deposit of soft matter in it. Portions of the pneumogastnc and sympathetic nerves are firmly united to the aneurismal sac. The external and internal carotid arteries are closed at the point of their communication with the aneurism, but appear of healthy texture. XIIL SUBCLAVIAN AND AXILLARY ARTERIES. 1511. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery, with part of a very large Aneurismal Sac. The aneurism occupies a part of the subclavian and the whole length ot the axillary artery to the commencement of the brachial; but only a small portion of the sac is preserved connecting the two parts of the artery. Bristles are passed into the apertures of communication between the artery and the sac ; both of which apertures are small, and smooth. The interior of the sac is tuber- culated and wrinkled, but polished as if fined by a continuation of the internal coat of the artery: the axillary nerves are connected with its exterior. Ihe arterv is neither changed in structure nor dilated on either side of the aneurism. J xiii. 67 1512. The Arch of an Aorta, with the left Subclavian and Axillary Arteries. The left axillary artery is the seat of an aneurism, for the cure of which the subclavian artery has been tied. The upper part of the preparation consists of the left subclavian artery and the arch of the aorta. By tracing the subclavian artery downwards, the situation where it has been tied will be recognised. On the side of the ligature nearest to the heart, the artery is pervious and of its ordi- nary size to its extremity, which was closed by only a small coagulum. Between this coagulum and the sides of the vessel is an aperture into which a bristle is passed, and through which blood had passed from the artery to the wound. At a short distance above the situation of the ligature, several large branches arise The portion of artery between the situation of the ligature and the aneurismal sac is completely closed by coagulum. The aneurismal sac also is m great part filled by laminated coagulum : its exterior is firmly attached to three of the ribs which have undergone partial absorption. Below the sac is the remaining part of the axillary, with the commencement of the brachial artery. The axillary artery from the point of its connection with the sac is quite pervious, and a large branch arises from it, which divides into the subscapular and circumflex arteries. The axillary vein is connected with the sac, and is pervious. Ihe coats of the subclavian artery above the situation of the ligature were so brittle that they yielded to the slightest force. xm- 21 The patient was a man, aged 38 years. The aneurism appeared to have existed four months and was first observed six months alter an attack of acute rheumatism. He died after repeated hemorrhages, on the thirteenth day from the application of the ligature. The case is described by Mr. Charles Mayo, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xn, p. 12. London, Presented by Charles Mayo, Esq. 1513. A Subclavian and Axillary Artery, the seat of Aneurism. The aneurism includes nearly three inches of the artery, and appears to be formed by dilatation of its whole circumference. The brachial plexus of nerves is connected with one side of the sac: and portions of the first and second ribs form part ot its boundaries. Only half an inch of the artery intervenes between the aneurismDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 231 and the cluster of branches arising from the first portion of the subclavian. For a short distance both above and below the aneurism, the coats or the artery are thickened, and soft, probably fatty matter is deposited m them ; but beyond these portions the arterial wall appears healthy. xin. bo" 1514. A large aneurism of the left Subclavian Artery. From a man, aged 50 years. It burst into the bronchus of the left lung, and into the left pleura. Hemoptysis occurred at frequent intervals during three or four days preceding deatn. 1515. An Aneurism of the right Axillary Artery. A silk ligature is seen on the third part of the subclavian artery. The wall of the aneurismal sac is lined by partially decolorised firm fibrin; the centre with softer blood-clot. The artery between the ligature and the sac is also filled with clot. From a man, aged 32 years, who died of pysemia twenty days after ligature of the subclavian artery. The lower parts of the jugular, subcla vian, and axillary veins were filled with blood clots.—See Pathological Society's Transactions, 1872, p. 74. A drawing is preserved, No. 106. Fide Nos. 1452, 1547, 1549. CEREBRAL ARTERIES. 1516. Portion of a Cerebrum, with an aneurism of the middle cerebral artery about au inch from its origin. The sac of the aneurism is filled by dark, firm, lami- nated coagulum ; its walls apparently consist, in the greater part of their extent, of the dilated coats of the artery. The arteries with which the aneurism is con- nected are larger and thicker than is natural. VI. 44 The patient was a man, aged 45 years. About two years before his death, he had an apoplectic attack. After this he had several slighter attacks, and was hemiplegic, though gradually recovering, to the time of his last illness; in which illness he had obscure signs of gastric disease, then became drowsy, and at last insensible, and died in a state of great exhaus- tion. The vertebral artery, after death, was found irregularly enlarged into pouches. The canal of the middle cerebral artery was pervious, the aneurismal dilatation affecting chiefly the inferior portion of its walls. 1517. Two middle Cerebral Arteries, from the same patient. The trunk of that of the right side is partially dilated into a small bilobed aneurismal sac, which is nearly filled by a coagulum of pale fibrin. The trunk of the left artery is ruptured at a point nearly corresponding to that from which the aneurism has arisen on the right side. The rupture, into which a bristle is passed, extends through all the coats of the artery, and in an irregular line round more than half its wall. There are several small deposits of fatty substance in the walls of the arteries. VI. 59 From a woman, aged 84 years, who died twenty-two hours after an attack of apoplexy. A copious effusion of blood had taken place from the ruptured artery, into the substance and membranes of the base of the brain. 1518. A left middle Cerebral Artery, with a small aneurism on one side of its trunk. The aneurism lay very deep in the fissura Sylvii, nearly imbedded in the adjacent cerebral convolutions, and it burst into the substance of the brain by the irregular rent which is indicated by a bristle. A part of its cavity is filled by a firm decolorised layer of coagulated blood. vi. 67 1519. A Clot of Blood, weighing between four and five ounces, which was effused from the aneurism last described into the substance of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. Vi. 68 The patient was a footman, aged 38 years. He had suffered from occasional giddiness, ring- ing in the ears, and other slight signs of disease of the brain ; and had enlargement, with disease of the valves of the heart; but he had been engaged in his work till the clay before his232 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. death, when, while leaning over the side of his bed, he suddenly became insensible, and in a few minutes died. There is a drawing of the brain witb tbe clot in its recent state, No. 350. 1520. Aneurism of a middle Cerebral Artery of irregular form, and solid in the greater part of its extent. A slight elevation upon its surface is marked by the convergence of three arteries, one of which is obliterated as it lies upon the sac wall. The remaining two, laid open and indicated by bristles, lead to the interior of a sac, evidently formed from part of their walls. About half an inch from these vessels there is a small rent, shown by a bristle which is passed through it. The wall at this point is formed of calcareous matter, and the slit is evidently due to the cracking of soft parts at the edge of one of the calcareous plates. From this aperture a quantity of blood had escaped during life, and had so determined the death of the patient. The tumour consists of laminated clot, except at the part where a small cavity is shown, with which the arteries described, as well as the crack, clearly commu- nicate. The sac wall is free from the calcareous change, except at the point referred to. vi. 81 From an elderly man, who had suffered from severe attacks of epilepsy. These ceased suddenly, and for eighty days he appeared to have regained his health. On the eighty-first day he died in a few hours with the usual symptoms of apoplexy. 1521. Aneurism of the right Middle Cerebral Artery. The aneurism is double, consisting of two sacs, the larger of which having much the thinner wall, com- municates with the smaller or thicker-walled sac, close to the opening between the latter and the artery. Both sacs contain laminated blood-clot. A. bristle is passed through the communication between the artery and thicker-walled sac, and out through a rupture in the wall of the thinner sac. From a boy, aged 13 years, who died from rupture of the aneurism. The arteries were generally healthy. The mitral valve was diseased, but the heart was not much hypertrophied. 1522. A sacculated Aneurism with thin walls at the bifurcation of the Middle Cerebral Artery. A large rent in the sac is seen. From a woman, aged 33 years, who died almost immediately after admission to the Hospital. Blood was effused into the pia mater at the base and over the convexity of the brain.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. iii, No. 120. 1523. An Aneurism as large as a hazel nut, springing from the right Middle Cerebral Artery about one inch from its origin. From a man, aged 50 years, who was for eight years an inmate of an asylum. His mania was neither epileptic, suicidal, nor dangerous, and he worked on the farm, except for two periods, when he was more or less violent and excited. There were no symptoms indicating cerebral aneurism. He died quite suddenly, when apparently in good health. A blood clot was found in the right fissure of Sylvius, which proceeded from a large rent on the distal side of the aneurism. There was considerable erosion of the brain tissue, in which the aneurism was imbedded. The brain substance was firm and pale. The arteries were small, tortuous, and undergoing calcareous degeneration. Presented by T. O. Wood, Esq. 1524. A small Saccular Aneurism of the Anterior Communicating Artery. A minute rupture is seen on its anterior aspect. From a woman, aged 56 years, who, when first seen, complained of severe headache, was dull, yet sensible. She gradually became comatose. The pupils were extremely contracted throughout. Death took place on the fourth day after the onset of symptoms. A clot was found in front of the optic commissure, which extended along the cerebral vessels. Presented by Mr. Spark. 1525. Part of a Brain showing iipon the Anterior Communicating Artery a small ruptured aneurism, the size of a hemp seed, and having very thin walls.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 233 From a man, aged 54 years. The blood was found to have made its way into the ventricles beneath the right hippocampus major. The pia mater of the base of the brain, and of the whole spinal cord, was full of blood. The arteries generally were atheromatous, and the left ventricle was much hypertrophied.—See Radcliffe Ward Book, February 12th, 1871. 1526. Aneurism of the Anterior Communicating- Artery, about the size of a small marble, and having a rent on its lower aspect. From a man, aged 41 years, who died about twenty-four hours after the onset of symptoms. Blood was found effused in the meninges, and it had forced its way through the corpus callo- sum into the lateral ventricles.—See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xii, 1876, p. 239. 1527. Aneurism of the Anterior Communicating Artery, from a man, aged 20 years, who was admitted into the Hospital with symptoms of meningeal haemorrhage, and died on the following day. The meninges were found filled with blood. The aneurism was not ruptured, and the source of the haemorrhage could not be ascertained. The arteries were free from atheroma. Heart and kidneys normal. No clots in the heart.—See Transactions of Pathological Society, vol. xxix, 1878, p. 106. 1528. An Aneurism the size of a large pea in front of the bifurcation of the Basilar Artery. From a woman, aged 40 years, who died suddenly in convulsions, while preparing to leave the Hospital into which she had been admitted one month previously for epilepsy. 1529. The Arteries at the base of the.Brain as seen from below. The left verte- bral is dilated. The basilar at its origin is thickened and dilated to the size of a split pea, and about the middle of the dilatation on the left side is a small opening, through which a glass rod has been passed. The specimen was taken from the body of a man, aged 52 years, who was admitted into the Hospital October 26th, 1877. He had fallen off his seat whilst at work, from vertigo, but there was no loss of consciousness and no convulsions. When first seen he could stand and walk; there was slight right facial palsy, with slight dilatation of the right pupil. Five hours later he suddenly uttered a cry, put his hand to the back of his neck, and became deeply comatose. His respirations fell in number to six in the minute, and he died half-an-hour later from increasing dyspnoea. A large clot surrounded the pons and medulla.—See Matthew Ward Booh, vol. vi, p. 165. 1530. The Arteries of a Brain, having upon them numerous miliary aneurisms. From a woman, aged 70 years, who had been subject to epileptic fits for seven years. She became hemiplegic on the left side three months before death, and during the two previous months she had only been partially conscious. There was slight yellow softening of the ante- rior inferior angle of the right cerebral hemisphere.—See case of Catherine Herbert Hope Ward Book, vol. i.

It is situated at the bifurcation o± the'abdominal aorta, and involves the left common iliac artery. 1538 Portion of a Common Iliac Artery, showing a small aneurism in the early sta^e of its formation. Immediately above the bifurcation, there is a circum- scribed dilatation on the posterior surface. The free edge of the inner coat forms a thick and uneven margin to the pouch, the wall of which is formed onlv bv the external and middle coats of the vessel. The artery is generally atheromatous ; a wide calcareous plate, nearly half an inch long, extends upward from the dilatation and forms part of its upper margin. From a middle-aged man, who died of apoplexy. All the arteries were extremely atheromatous. FEMORAL ARTERY. 1539 Iliac and Femoral Arteries, with an Aneurism at the commencement of the femoral artery, for the cure of which the external iliac has been tied. The sac is large nearly globular, and in great part filled by laminated coagulum. Upon its lower part a portion of the skin is left, with the aperture through which it burst externally The ligature was applied about an inch and a quarter above the sac and it has completely divided the internal coats of the artery Between the situation of the ligature and the sac there is a small deposit of fibrinous coao-ulum. Between the situation of the ligature and the division of the common iliac, the artery is completely filled by coagulated blood. The coats of the artery are apparently healthy. The femoral artery, as it passes out of the lower part of the sac, is impervious. The profunda passes out of the middle of +V,p sac and is pervious. The femoral vein is open above and below the sac, and is obliterated by the pressure of the sac in the mid-space. The anterior crural nerve is connected with the sac, and is flattened by its pressure. The patient was a man 70 years old. The aneurism had existed two years and a half beforeDISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 235 it burst through the sloughing integuments. The artery was tied directly after the rupture, and the patient lived fifty-five hours. 1540. An Aneurism of the common Femoral Artery, for which the external iliac was tied. The patient, a man, aged 40 years, hud long suffered from severe attacks of gout and from disease of the heart. A swelling in the groin was noticed four weeks before his admission to the Hospital, which rapidly increased in size. He died on the fourth day after the operation from peritonitis ; the peritoneum was wounded in the operation. See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. i, p. 110. 1541. Aneurism of the left Femoral Artery. The aneurism occupies the upper portion of the artery, extending from an inch below Poupart's ligament to the profunda artery. The front wall of the aneurism is formed by a fusiform dilatation of all the coats of the artery, their texture being but little altered. Posteriorly, the aneurism is sacculated, about the size of an orange, and tunned by a diffused and irregular mass of coagulum having no definite boundary wall. On passing a stream of water, uuder slight pressure, into the artery from above, none appeared to escape from the lower end; and it was evident, on further examination of the clot contained in the aneurism, that it was sufficiently firm to have arrested the current of blood through it.

Aneurism of the right Popliteal Artery. The artery is thickened and atheromatous. The aneurism springs entirely from the posterior aspect of the vessel, commencing about one inch and a quarter above the origin of the tibial vessels. The arterial coat appears to terminate abruptly and cannot be traced in the aneurismal sac, which was principally formed of thickened cellular tissue and expanded muscle, but in one place the skin only bounded it, and in others it seemed to have consisted only of fascia. The popliteal nerve was tightly stretched over the sac, rendering it more or less bilobed. The vein very much contracted, was flattened out near the sac. The termination of the artery was filled by a moderately firm plug, which was continuous with a firm decolorised clot in the entrance of the sac. The centre of the sac was full of dark coagulum (which has been washed out), but the wall was lined by decolorised laminae of fibrin. That in the upper half is firm and tough, but the lower portion is softer, and in parts almost diffluent. From a man, aged 65 years. 1542a. The Femoral Artery and Vein of the man from whom the preceding pre- paration was taken. The artery was tied in Scarpa's triangle fourteen days before death. The ligature was found detached on the day on which death occurred. About three-quarters of an inch of the artery and vein, corresponding to the seat of the ligature, has sloughed away. The ends of the vessels were lying separated in the cavity of the wound, connected by the saphena nerve, which is preserved. The vessels are both firmly occluded by coloured clots' that in the artery reaching upwards to the profunda, and downwards for some inches. There was at no time any symptom of venous obstruction. 1543. Popliteal Aneurism, with nearly the whole of the femoral artery and vein of the left side. The artery was tied with carbolised catgut in Scarpa's triangle. A small jagged perforation of the arterial coats was found near the spot where the vessel was tied.

A Popliteal Artery, with part of a large Aneurismal Sac. The upper portion of the artery is pervious to its termination in the sac, into which it opens by a smooth round orifice. The lower portion of the vessel is also pervious, and communicates with the sac by an opening of considerable length. The upper portion of the popliteal vein is obliterated; the lower part is pervious. xm. 53 1545. Portion of a Popliteal Artery laid open, showing a circular ulcer, with soft and uneven margins, between two and three lines in diameter, which has perforated its walls. For some distance above, and to a less extent below, the coats of the vessel are thickened by earthy deposit. xni. 143 It was removed from a man, aged 33, who was admitted into the Hospital with a large aneurismal tuniour immediately below the popliteal space. He had discovered it five weeks previously, and it was then nearly as large as when he was admitted. The femoral artery was tied in the usual place. The ligature separated on the tenth day, and the man left the Hospital six weeks afterwards with the wound nearly healed. Three weeks after he had returned home profuse haemorrhage occurred from the wound, then almost closed. This subsequently recurred, and the patient died. In the post mortem examination it was shown that the haemorrhage proceeded from the upper end of the artery, where it had been tied (see the following preparation). This had separated from the lower end, and contained only a small coagulum. It was obviously patent. The large mass below consists of blood-clot, and the surrounding tissues. The aneurism had no other sac. Immediately above the ulcer there was a small coagulum. 1546.

SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING THE MODE OF CURE OF ANEURISM. SPONTANEOUS CURE. 1547. The Arch of an Aorta, with the Subclavian and Carotid Arteries. The right subclavian artery exhibits the remains of an aneurism which has been spontaneously cured. The aneurism appears to have been formed by dilatation of the whole circumference of a portion of the artery about two inches long. On each side of the aneurism the artery is contracted and completely closed: above the aneurism its walls appear to have coalesced; below the aneurism its cavity is filled by fibrin to the extent of nearly an inch. The inner coat of the aorta and its branches is thickened, and there are deposits of soft substance beneath it. xm. 75 By Deposit of Laminated Fibrin. 1548.

There is also an embolon m the left femoral artery near the origin of the profunda. From a woman, aged 39 years. Although the respective dates of the aneurism of the subcla- vian and the embolon in the axillary artery cannot with certainty be fixed, it seems probable that the latter was of later date than the former, and was a chief cause of the consolidation of the aneurism. To this consolidation the aortic obstruction also probably contributed largely. Symptoms of embolism of the femoral artery appeared about three weeks before death, whilst the patient lay in bed in the Hospital. She had been admitted some months previously with the following history:—Three weeks before, whilst doing heavy work, she was seized with a violent pain in the right arm, followed by loss of power. A swelling soon afterwards appeared in the neck. The swelling diminished some time before death.—See Lucas Ward Boole, vol. ii, p. 423 ; and Pathological Society Transactions, vol. xxiv, p. 67. 1550. Aneurism of a branch of the superior Mesenteric Artery. The aneurism is about the size of a pigeon's egg, and its cavity is nearly filled by laminated fibrin. Several branches are given off from it.

DEPOSIT OF BLOOD-CLOT OR LAMINATED FIBRIN FROM LIGATURE OF, OR PRESSURE ON, THE ARTERY SUPPLYING- THE ANEURISMAL SAC. 1551. A large Aneurism of the left Femoral Artery for which the external iliac artery was tied. The parts preserved are the left internal and external iliac and femoral arteries; portions of the corresponding veins and of the anterior crural nerve. The external iliac artery has been tied exactly two inches above the crural arch. The tissues about that point have not been disturbed. The artery is laid open above and below the ligature: a firm clot fills the canal for one inch and three-quarters above, and for three-quarters of an inch below it. Three branches of the ordinary size arise from the last inch of this vessel. There was nothing abnormal in the common or internal iliac arteries. The branches of the latter were not enlarged. The tumour, of an irregularly oval shape, involves the first part of the femoral artery for three inches, commencing abruptly at the crural arch, and ending in a similar manner three-quarters of an inch below the origin of the profunda. Its greatest circumference is eleven and a quarter inches, and its diameter four and a half inches. The section shows that the sac is composed of the arterial tunics and the sheath of the vessel. The latter has been in part removed from behind to expose the vein. On the surface of the section the several structures forming the sac have been raised, and their continuity with the healthy arterial tissues demonstrated. The external coat and the sheath are thickeued ; the internal coats much attenuated. The section shows at the circumference laminated pale fibrin closely adherent to the lining membrane of the sac. B.ecent clots, now hardened by spirit, form the rest of the contents. The profunda artery arises from nearly the lowest part of the aneurism : it is of the usual size and pervious. The small superficial vessels, usually given from the first part of the femoral artery, are absent: this is probably explained by the occurrence of a third branch from the external iliac. The femoral vein, behind the tumour, is laid open : it is plugged at the lower part. The saphena vein is thickened but pervious. The anterior crural nerve is spread out on the wall of the sac. The specimen was taken from an intemperate sailor, aged 32 years. -His tissues were loaded with fat. A large pulsating tumour had existed in the groin'for eighteen months. At the238 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. time of his admission it raised Poupart's ligament and encroached on the pelns. JH»J»* was cedeinatous. There was an indefinite account of Borne :iSSSTfcoS before the aneurism appeared. The man died on the eighth day after the operation from dSu7e suppuration inthe cellular tissue between the abdominal muscles, and m *» •£» toneal tissue at the back of the abdomen. The liver and kidneys were congested and fatty. 1552. Aneurism of the Popliteal Artery filled with recent laminated fibrin The aneurism had been treated by flexion of the patient's limb upon the trunk, and all pulsation in the sac had ceased. Four hours after the limb had been returned to the horizontal posture symptoms, supposed to be those of gangrene, made their appearance and amputation through the limb was performed. The patient made a good recovery. Vide Nos. 1509, 1510, 1512,1515, 1541, 1542. SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING THE PROGRESS OF ANEURISM. RUPTURE OF ANEURISM. Vide Nos. 1457, 1460, 1543.

The Base of a Heart, with the large vessels, the Trachea, and the Bronchial Glands. The whole of the bronchial glands are converted into one large mass of new growth (probably lympho-sarcoma), of very firm consistence, and a pale pinkish white colour, irregularly mixed with the ordinary black pigment of the bronchial glands. Both the main bronchial tubes pass through this mass ; and they are much compressed. It surrounds and compresses the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the vena cava superior. The arteria innominata and both the vense innominatee are also pressed upon by the upper part of the growth. The vena cava superior is so much compressed that its canal would scarcely admit more than the bristle which is passed through it. At the junction of the venre innominatae, the morbid growth appears to have made its way into the cavity of the vein. Near the junction of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins, beneath the valve, there is a small growth from the interior of the vein, the structure of which appears to resemble that of the large tumour. The patient was a man, 30 years old. The disease was of about six months standing. Its progress was attended by great dyspnoea, and by enlargement of the cutaneous veins of the face, neck, and trunk, especially of those on the right side of the neck and chest. The venous current in them all ran downwards. 1556. Parts of an Abdominal Aorta, and of the Vena Cava Inferior. Both vessels are embedded in a mass of enlarged lymphatic glands. The coats of the aorta are thickened, and its cavity is contracted just above its division into the iliac arteries. The vena cava, to the extent of three inches above the iliac veins, is completely filled by concentric layers of fibrin which are adherent to its inner surface. xiii. 17 Vide Nos. 1497,1520,1548. EMBOLISM AND THEOMBOSIS OE ARTERIES. 1557. Part of the Arteries from the base of a brain. Injection, impelled into the left internal carotid artery, filled all the arteries of the circle of Willis that were removed from the brain, except the left middle cerebral artery. The trunk and principal branches of this artery are contracted and closed upon fibrinous clots, which were detached from the aortic valves, and carried into the artery with the stream of blood. vi. 75 From a woman who died, about two months after the occurrence, of hemiplegia, and nearly four months after delivery. There was extensive softening of the left corpus striatum and other adjacent parts of the brain. The aortic valves were extensively diseased. 1558. A right internal Carotid Artery, with its primary branches. Its canal is occluded by a soft, coloured coagulum, which extends nearly as far as the bifur- cation of the middle cerebral, and terminates in a small trefoil-shaped nodule which projects into the commencement of one of the branches. This is less darkly coloured and more firm than the remainder of the clot. vi. 77 From the body of a man who had extensive disease of the heart, especially of the mitral valve. Two days before his death he was apparently in his usual health ; he suddenly fell, and was brought to the Hospital with all the symptoms of apoplexy, accompanied by left hemiplegia The greater portion of the right hemisphere was soft, and about its centre quite diffluent ■ the walls of the several arteries of the brain were free from disease. • ' 1559.

Portion of a Femoral Artery, exhibiting the obliteration of its trnnk and of the commencement of the profunda, by the deposit of fibrin in concentric layers, forming a firm clot about an inch in length. The arterial coats appear healthy. xni. 22 From a young man who died with disease of the aortic valves. Some time before his death the limb from which this artery was taken became, without any evident cause, pulseless and cold. 1561. A portion of the right Femoral Artery of the patient from whom the specimen of disease of the aortic valves shown in Series VII, No. 1332, was taken. A few days before death he complained of acute pain and numbness in the right thigh. The temperature of the limb was at the same time con- siderably reduced. The artery is laid open to show a firm fibrinous plug filling up and obstructing the canal. The clot presented in different parts some slight differences of consistence and colour. The walls of the artery exhibited in some spots traces of atheromatous degeneration. 1562. A Clot, which was removed from the pulmonary artery of a woman, aged 33 years, who died suddenly from syncope nineteen days after delivery of her third child, having apparently progressed favourably up to that date. The clot measures three inches in length and about one in diameter. One extremity, that which was towards the heart, is smooth and conical; the opposite is hollow, with ragged edges, leading into a cavity which occupies the greater portion of the "interior, and is partially filled with grumous rust-coloured fibrin. It appears as if the clot had been gradually softening and disinte- grating from the interior. The exterior is of a deep orange-colour, and its struc- ture presents no trace of lamination. xm. 152 1563. Another and smaller Clot, in situ, from the opposite lung in the same case. It measures two inches and three-quarters in length and half an inch in diameter. Its extremity is rough and conical. It completely fills one of the primary pulmonary trunks, being continued into three branches by forked extremities. Of these, two, like the main clot, are firm and solid, the third is soft and pulpy. xm- 153 Presented with the preceding by Mr. Havers. 1564. A Pulmonary Artery, with a portion of the Lung. The right branch of the pulmonary artery is completely filled by a firm coagulum of fibrin, closely adherent to its internal surface. The smaller branches are also filled by similar coao-ula. The portion of the coagulum in the lower part of the bottle acci- dentally separated in the examination of the body. xm. 100 The patient, a middle-aged lady, died suddenly during apparent convalescence after the removal of a large medullary tumour of the breast, preserved in No. 3310, Series L. The case is related by Sir J.Paget in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxvii, p. 166. London, 1844. 1565. Arteries from the base of a Brain, the canals of which are in various decrees obstructed by coagula.

The clot itself is pervious, a bristle being passed along its canal, which, in the recent state, was occupied by fluid blood. It thus formed a perfect tube within the artery. xin. 133 1567. Clot from a Pulmonary Artery, partly blood-coloured, partly of a pale fawn-tint. It exactly filled the canal of the vessels and the pouches behind the cusps, the latter being pressed inward, as shown by the moulding of the pre- paration.

The Superior Mesenteric Artery of a man, aged 29 years, upon whose abdominal aorta long-continued pressure under chloroform was applied for the cure of an aneurism at the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta (see No. 1537). The artery presented a bruised and purple appearance, and was flattened out from its origin for a little more than an inch. The coats of the artery were infiltrated, and the inner presented an appearance as if greatly inflamed. Here and there coagula were firmly adherent, but a central canal still existed. The splenic artery was in this case given off from the superior mesenteric Portions of coagula had passed into the spleen and pancreas. The lower part of the pancreas was disintegrated.

The coagula in the profunda were traced to a considerable eccbymosis which involved the structures about a fracture of the right femur, more especially in the inner aud posterior aspect of the thigh. The entire extremity was cedematous. The fracture, which had occurred ten weeks prior to the patient's death, was still ununited. XIII. 158 The patient, a man, aged 12, died from an attack of continued fever. 1599. A Femoral Vein, from a man, aged 42 years. It is filled with blood, which coagulated in it a few days before death. The same condition was prese nted by all the veins of both arms and legs. The patient's illness, which was ascribed to phlebitis, began three weeks before death. 1600. Part of an external Saphena Vein. In consequence of a morbid growth involving and extending from the lower part of the femur of a young woman, the principal veins of the leg became obstructed by clots giving rise to marked cedema. The veins shrank upon the clots as the latter contracted, so that their canals in the midst of cedematous tissue were much reduced in size, and their walls appeared thickened, as though from inflammation. By injecting water they were easily restored to their natural size and appearance, as shown in the preparation. 1^7 For other specimens of Coagula in Veins, vide Nos. 1271, 1442, 1459, 1556,1571, 1571b. ORGANIZATION, AND CALCIFICATION OF BLOOD-CLOTS IN "VEINS. 1601. External Pubic Veins from a Horse. The coats of the veins are sound. Within the cavity of one of them there are firm coagula of blood attached to the inner surface of the vein by solid round cords, behind some of which bristles are passed. One of these cords extends between two of the coagula, without having any attachment to the inside of the vein. XIII. 107 1602. Two Coagula of Blood, which were found attached to the inside of one of the veins preserved in the preceding specimen. The section of one coagulum shows that it consists of regularly arranged layers of fibrin. The other coagulum is enclosed in three distinct cysts, of which the outer two are membranous, and the inner consists chiefly of bone. XIII. 108 1603. A portion of an External Saphena Vein, containing masses of calcareous matter, which fill here and there the entire canal of the vessel, the walls being contracted around them. They are probably the remains of blood-clots. From the body of a man, aged 46 years, brought into the dissection rooms. 1604. A long and slender branching piece of Bone, from the liver of a Sheep. It was probably formed in obliterated branches of the portal vein. XIII. 93 OBLITERATION OF VEINS. 1605. Portion of a Vena Cava Inferior, from a woman, aged 35 years, who died with epithelial cancer of the uterus, and amyloid degeneration of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and small arteries of the intestines. The cavity of the vein is completely obliterated for about one inch, from a point just below the entranceDISEASES AND INJURIES OF VEINS. 248 of the right renal vein. The left renal vein is impervious, the blood from the kidney having returned, partly by a vein passing into the suprarenal capsule, but principally by a large vessel passing downwards and backwards to a venous plexus on the sides of the vertebrae, through which the blood from the lower part of the body appears to have reached the vena azygos, which was of unusual size. The obstruction appears to have been occasioned by the organiza- tion of a clot. She suffered from dropsy about ten months before death, from which she recovered. The feet and legs were swollen for the last two months of her life. 1606. A Vena Cava Inferior obliterated. The preparation consists of the remains of the vena cava, the right kidney, and a firm ileshy tumour, which has been formed between them. A great part of the kidney is absorbed. The vena cava is obliterated from its bifurcation almost to its termination in the auricle. The upper part of the vein is distended by fibrinous substance, which appeared to have been separated from the blood. Below this the vein could not be traced ; it appeared to be completely lost in the diseased structure. xm. 29 Vide Nos. 1396, 1539, 1555.

OSSIFICATION OF CARTILAGES OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 1610. A Larynx from an old woman. The thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid carti- lages are almost entirely ossified. Osseous matter is also deposited in one of the thyro-hyoid ligaments, and in the epiglottis. xxv. 18 1611. Portion of a trachea from an old man. The cartilages are all ossified. xxv. 20 EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION. Q2DEMA GLOTTIDIS. 1612. The Larynx with a part of the Trachea of a man who died with acnte laryngitis. The mucous membrane covering the epiglottis, and lining the whole interior of the larynx, is swollen by a copious effusion of serum and lymph in its tissue. The ventricles of the larynx are nearly obliterated by the swelling of the membrane and the consequent approximation of their borders. A small quantity of lymph is effused on a part of the mucous membrane over the right side of the epiglottis and thyroid cartilage. xxv. 7 The patient was about 50 years old, and was healthy until within tliirtv hours of his death when signs of acute laryngitis ensued. When brought to the Hospital suffocation was immi- nent. Tracheotomy was immediately commenced; but he died before the operation was completed. 1613. A Larynx, with the Tonsils, Uvula, a part of the Tongue, Trachea and Pharynx, the latter having been laid open from behind. The mucous membrane lining the epiglottis, and upper part of the larynx, the tonsils, and uvula, is swollen and oedematous, so that the entrance to the pharynx is almost oblite- rated, and that of the larynx reduced to a narrow chink. xxv. 31 1614. Extreme oedema of the Glottis, Epiglottis, and Pharynx, producing death by suffocation. & From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1615. A Larynx, of which all the mucous membrane is upraised, and the glottis much narrowed, by oedema. The epiglottis is thickened, and its edges turned backwards and downwards. The oedema extended, also, down the pharynx and oesophagus, and was attended, in the recent state, with the characters of active inflammation. xxv. 29 These changes apnear as the consequences of the lodgment of a fish-bone across the fauces immediately m front of the epiglottis. The patient was an elderly woman, with disci of theDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 250 heart; and neither her complaints, nor any symptoms observed during life, indicated the ob- struction in her larynx : though it probably existed for at least two or three dajs before death.

The mucous surface is covered by a tough membrane, which is scattered in shreds over the larynx: but, from the lower border of the thyroid cartilage downwards, it forms a continuous and perfect tube, which has been laid open in the preparation. In the bronchi it completely fills their canals. XXY- ^0 1617. The Larynx and Trachea of a child who died with croup. A continuous thin and very delicate layer of lymph is deposited upon the mucous membrane lining the larynx, trachea, and main bronchial tubes. xxv. 11 1618. The Larynx, Trachea, and Bronchi of a child who died with croup. The mucous membrane is covered by an abundant but not continuous deposit of lymph, which extends from the inferior surface of the epiglottis to the main bronchi. Tracheotomy was performed for the relief of dyspnoea. xxv. 15 Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq. 1619. The Larynx and Trachea of a child who died with croup. A thin layer of lymph, of a greenish colour, extends from the under surface of the epiglottis to about half an inch below the cricoid cartilage. xxv. 6 1620. Diphtheritic inflammation of the Larynx, Trachea, and Bronchi. 64 From a woman. From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1621. A Larynx and Trachea, of which the mucous membrane is almost uniformly lined by a thin layer of lymph, which is slightly adherent, and is rough and granulated on its inner surface. XXY- 19 The patient, a woman, 25 years old, had had fever. During her recovery, but while she was vcrv weak, symptoms of acute laryngitis ensued, for which laiyngotomy was performed on the third day. She lived twelve hours, and after death all the bronchial tubes were found similarly lined by lymph. The case, related by Sir Wm. Lawrence, is in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xxvi, p. 307, 1845. 1622. The Larynx and Trachea of a child who died with diphtheria. A false- membrane is seen covering a considerable portion of the mucous surface of the n „ xxv. 40 larynx. ULCERATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE LARYNX. 1623 A Larynx and Trachea. The whole of the mucous membrane covering the inferior surface of the epiglottis, and lining the larynx and trachea, presents closely set, minute, and, for the most part shallow, ulcers, which have m some places coalesced, so as to give the appearance of diffuse superficial ulcera- tion. Near the posterior extremity of each chorda vocalis there is a small, oval, excavated ulcer, the result probably of tubercular disease. The uvula is bifid. xxv. 3 1624. A Larynx and Trachea, with the base of the Tongue and the adjacent parts The upper two-thirds of the epiglottis has been destroyed by ulceration, and all the adjacent part of the mucous membrane, as far down as the chorda? vocales is deeply ulcerated. There is also a distinct oval ulcer on the mucous membrane, near the posterior attachment of the true vocal cords. The ulcera- tion is irregular on each side, but exactly symmetrical; it does not extend down to the cartflage. xxv- 27 1625. A Larynx, exhibiting a large well-defined ulceration of the mucous mem-251 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. brane extending into the substance of the cricoid cartilage, which is partially ossified. Around the ulcer the mucous membrane is thickened and puckered. xxv. 8 From a woman 24 years old, who had had signs of laryngitis for a weei, and died suffocated by the closure of the glottis. 1626. A Larynx, with the Tongue. The mucous membrane covering the epi- glottis and the upper part of the larynx is thickened and superficially ulcerated. xxv. 14 From a negro, 24 years old, who had had elephantiasis for two years. He died with gangrene of the lungs, and the mucous membrane of the tongue, soft palate, epiglottis, and neighbouring parte was found ulcerated. SYPHILITIC ULCERATION. 1627. A Larynx and Trachea, with the base of the Tongue. The whole of the epiglottis, and part of the arytenoid cartilages with their connecting folds of membrane, have been removed by ulceration. xxv. 5 From a young woman who had long suffered from syphilis, for which she had taken large quantities of mercury. 1628. A Tongue, with part of a Larynx, in which a circumscribed irregular ulceration has destroyed the epiglottis, the right arytenoid cartilage, and the fold of mucous membrane connecting them. xxv. 24 1629. A Larynx, exhibiting considerable swelling of the right arytaeno-epiglotti- dean fold and the tissues above the right false vocal cord. Immediately beneath the right true vocal cord there is a slit-shaped ulcer, extending along nearly its whole length. The ulcer leads into a small, but deep cavity, containing debris. A similar, but smaller ulcer is seen immediately beneath it. xxv. 46 From a man, aged 42 years, who was admitted to the Hospital, suffering from considerable dyspnoea. He had had laryngeal symptoms for about three months. Tracheotomy was per- formed shortly after his admission, and he liyed three days after the operation. There was a history of primary syphilis seven years previously, and at the time he had gummatous syphilitic disease of the tongue. On post-mortem examination the rima glottidis was found completely closed by oedema of the cellular tissue about the right arytseno-epiglottidean fold, which formed a soft well-defined tumour about the size and shape of a cob-nut.—See Darker Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 63. 1630. The Larynx of a man, aged 50. He was admitted into the Hospital with loss of voice and other symptoms indicating disease of the larynx, the origin of which was referred to syphilis. He never complained of, or seemed to experience, any difficulty in swallowing. Death took place rather suddenly from softening of the brain. The larynx is laid open from behind, and the mucous membrane is seen to be thickened and indurated throughout. In different portions there is evidence of former ulceration. JSTo traces of the epiglottis are visible ; it appears to have been wholly destroyed, a slight ridge only marking its place of attachment. xxv. 39 Vide No. 1634. TUBERCULAR ULCERATION OF THE LARYNX. 1631. A Larynx from a man, aged 32, who died of phthisis. A superficial ulcer extends along the whole length of the free margin of both vocal cords. There is also an oblong superficial ulcer on the mucous membrane close to the posterior attachment of the right cord. The mucous membrane covering the larynx and epiglottis is injected, but otherwise healthy.—See Post Mortem Booh vol. vii p. 234. 1632. A Larynx with part of the Trachea, from a man in whom tracheotomy was performed two days before death. Upon the epiglottis, the arytenoid cartilages and the chordse vocales, the mucous membrane is thickened, ulcerated, and granular. Within the trachea, and especially upon its posterior wall, there'is an252 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. almost continuous ulceration, which in some parts is superficial, in others extends deeply, and which at one point has formed an irregular opening through the walls of the trachea. xxv. 23 The patient died with phthisis. Tracheotomy was rendered necessary by imminent danger of suffocation; and the signs of the disease of the larynx had nearly concealed those of the disease of the lungs. The case is related by Sir G-eorge Burrows, Bart., in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xxi, p. 50. London, 1837. 1633. Portion of a Larynx, exhibiting an irregular, probably tubercular ulcera- tion of the mucous membrane covering the vocal cords; the remaining tissue is so thickened that the rima glottidis is nearly closed. xxv. 2 1633a. A Larynx. The whole of the upper part of the larynx, from the base of the epiglottis to the glottis, presents a deep, irregular ulceration of the mucous membrane ; the false vocal cords are destroyed. The true vocal cords are almost completely destroyed, and the mucous membrane below them is super- ficially ulcerated. From a man, aged 39 years, who died of phthisis.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. viii, p. 113. THICKENING AND INDURATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 1634. The Tongue and Larynx of a man who for some years before his death had suffered severely from syphilis. He died suddenly, apparently suffocated. The mucous membrane covering the larynx, epiglottis, base of the tongue, and surrounding parts, is much thickened and indurated. The papillas circum- vallatse are considerably enlarged. xxv. 36 A drawing is preserved, No. 124. Presented by Mr. Langmore. STRICTURE OF THE LARYNX. 1635. The Larynx and Trachea of a man on whom the operation of tracheotomy was performed twelve years before death. The opening into the trachea is situated immediately below the cricoid cartilage. The rima glottidis is almost closed by the thickening and contraction of the mucous membrane lining the larynx. The chordaa vocales also are so much shortened that the arytaanoid cartilages are within a quarter of an inch of the angle of the thyroid cartilage. The trachea is healthy. xxv. 12 The patient continued to the time of his death to breathe easily through a canula in the opening made in the operation. NECROSIS OF THE LARYNGEAL CARTILAGES. 1636. A Larynx, in which there is necrosis with separation of a large portion of the cricoid cartilage. Previous to the necrosis the cartilage had become calcified. The separated portion lies in a large cavity like an abscess in the walls of the larynx. xxv* * 1637. A Larynx, exhibiting the destruction of great part of the thyroid, cricoid, and arytsenoid cartilages, by ulceration. xxv. 4 Previous to the ulceration the diseased cartilages were ossified. The patient died suffocated, after a short illness. The mucous membrane about the diseased cartilages was very cedeinatous. 1638. A Larynx, in which an abscess formed around the greater part of the thyroid cartilage. A large portion of the right ala of the cartilage is destroyed bv ulceration; nearly all the rest of both its surfaces is exposed, and there is a laro-e opening of communication between the abscess and the interior of the larynx. XXT- *® From a man, 27 years old, who had ulceration of the tonsils and the back of the pharynx. He died from gradual exhaustion. 1639. A Larynx, exhibiting necrosis and separation of the left arytaenoid carti- lage, and of part of the cricoid cartilage. Previous to the necrosis the separated253 DISAESES AND INJURIES OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. portions of cartilage had become calcified. Tracheotomy was performed for the relief of dyspnoea. xxv- 9 The patient, a man between 40 and 50 years old, had been profusely salivated for syphilitic disease. After this, dyspnoea and other signs of obstruction in the larynx gradually increased for a month; and when they had been for several days extremely severe, an opening was made through the cricoid cartilage and the first ring of the trachea. The patient lived eight days, and died with pleurisy. The case is related by Sir Wm. Lawrence, m the Medico-Ltururgicat Transactions, vol. vi, p. 223. London, 1815. Vide also Nos. 1640, 1611,1643, 1644. AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX IN TYPHOID FEVER. 1640. A Larynx. Immediately behind the posterior attachment of each true vocal cord there is an oval ulcerated aperture, leading into a cavity formed by the separated perichondrium, and containing the necrosed arytamoid cartilages, bathed in pus. The cavity on the right side is laid open to show the necrosed arytenoid cartilage. The larynx presents no other abnormal appearances. From a man, aged 36 years, who died of exhaustion from typhoid fever, on the fifty-third day of his illness, lie was progressing favourably, when, a fortnight before his death, (lie temperature again rose, but uo laryngeal symptoms were observed. On post-mortem examina- tion the intestinal ulcers were found to be healing.—See Matthew Ward Book, vol. vh, p. 194; Post Mortem Book, vol. xii, p. 233. 1641. A precisely similar specimen. From a female, aged 27 years, who died of typhoid fever on the twenty-fourth day of her illness. She was progressing fairly well until three days before her death, when hoarseness of the voice was noticed. On the day preceding her death she complained of pain in the throat ; dyspnoea came on, and she died exhausted. On post mortem examination some oedema of the arytamo-epiglottidean folds was observed. Healing appeared to have commenced in the intestinal ulcers.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. v, p. 218; also, an account of this case, the preceding, and No. 1643, by Mr. Eve, in the Trans. Path. Soc, vol. xxxi, 1880. AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX IN VARIOLA. 1642. The Larynx and Trachea of a patient who died with small-pox. Lymph is thinly deposited over the surface of the mucous membrane. xxv. 13 1643. A Larynx, showing perichondritis as a sequela of Small-pox. A consider- able extent of the upper margin and posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage is hi id bare by the separation of the infiltrated and discoloured perichondrium. The arytamoid cartilages are necrosed, and lie loose within the separated peri- chondrium ; the crico-arytenoid articulation is destroyed. A small oval ulcer close to the posterior attachment of the vocal cords on either side leads into the cavity beneath the perichondrium. The arytamo-epiglottidean folds are swollen, as is also the epiglottis. The mucous membrane of the larynx and of the trachea is injected. Immediately beneath the cricoid cartilage a tracheotomy opening is seen. The specimen was taken from a man recovering from a bad attack of unmodified confluent small-pox. Laryngeal symptoms were first observed shortly after the subsidence of the secondary fever, on the twenty-first day from the commencement of his illness. Tracheotomy was per- formed for the relief of dyspnoea, but the patient died on the second day afterwards. Presented by Mr. Strugnell. 1644. A Larynx and Trachea. Just above the vocal cords there is a fistulous ulcer beneath the mucous membrane of the back of the larynx, in front of the arytamoid cartilages. Part of its course is marked by a bristle. The mucous membrane coveriug the whole of the larynx and trachea is thickened, and rough on its internal surface, as if by a thin deposit of lymph. Near the attachment of the epiglottis are several small superficial ulcers. The arytamoid cartilages have disappeared. They were probably necrosed, and fell out from the abscess cavities. XXY The patient died with small-pox.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 254 TUMOURS CONNECTED WITH THE LARYNX. PAPILLOMA, &c. 1645. The Larynx of a child 2 years old. The surface of the mucous membrane lining the thyroid cartilage, the ventricles of the larynx, and the lower part of the epiglottis, is occupied by a wai't-like growth composed of numerous small, oval, pedunculated bodies, closely set together, and of a firm consistence. xxv. 17 The child had had dyspnoea from the time of birth, and died suffocated. 1646. The Larynx of a child. The cavity of the larynx is almost entirely occupied by a warty growth, projecting from its mucous membrane. xxv. 25 The child was 3 years old, and had dyspnoea and cough from a week after its birth. It died with symptoms like those of croup. Tubercles were found in the lungs, spleen, liver, and mesenteric glands. Presented by H. Bateman, Esq. 1647. A Larynx and adjacent parts. A papillomatous growth springs from the surface of and the mucous membrane immediately below the left true vocal cord. A smaller linear extension of the growth also springs from the mucous mem- brane below the right vocal cord. The microscopic characters of the growth were those of true papilloma. From a boy, aged 9 years, who had suffered from symptoms of laryngeal obstruction for about six months. Dux-ing the three weeks preceding his death he had occasional violent attacks of dyspnoea, one of which ultimately proved fatal.—See Pitcaim Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 271. 1648. A Larynx and part of a Trachea. Irregular, soft growths are abundantly clustered about the vocal cords and ventricles. They project into the canal of the larynx so as almost to close it. In structure they resemble imperfect fibro- cellular tissue. xxv. 38 From a boy, aged 12 years, who, twelve months before his death, caught cold and suffered for a time with loss of voice. Treatment failed to benefit him, the apbonia persisting and being, before long, associated with dyspnoea. Respiration was attended with a stridulous sound. He continued his occupation without hindrance. Death took place suddenly from apncea. Presented by Mr. Phillips. 1649. A Larynx laid open. A large growth springs from each vocal cord. That on the left side is covered by warty and fine villous processes. The sur- face of the growth on the right side is smooth. They appear to have almost completely obstructed the glottis. From a man, aged 56 years, who for some months had suffered with extreme hoarseness, and later with considerable difficulty of breathing, with cough, and occasional paroxysms of severe dyspnoea. He, however, continued his occupation as a cabman until a fatal paroxysm occurred, and was brought to the Hospital dead. POLYPUS. 1650. A Larynx. On the upper end and inner aspect of the right true vocal cord, at the junction of its anterior and middle third, there is a small, conical, highly vascular polypus. From a man, aged 63 years, who died of phthisis. There was no history of any laryngeal symptoms. 1651. A Larynx, having two elongated, soft polypoid-looking growths attached to the false vocal cords on either side, and overlapping the ventricles of the larynx. They appeared to be composed of a fold of mucous membrane.DISEASES AND INJURIES TO THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 255 From a midfe-ageel man, who died of phthisis. He had no laryngeal symptoms, and there w as no ulceration of the larynx. EPITHELIOMA 1652. A Larynx'laid open from behind, showing an epithelioma which is attached to the right arytamo-epiglottidean fold. xxv. 66 Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 67. 1653. A Pharynx, with the Tongue, Larynx, and other parts. A tumour, pro- bably an epithelioma, of almost globular form, and nearly an inch m diameter, is situated on the right arytamo-epiglottidean fold. The surrounding mucous membrane is deeply wrinkled; the fluid by which it was rendered cedematous having escaped. XX1V- 17 The patient, a man about 40 years old, had for some months suffered with pain in the throat, and difficulty of breathing and deglutition. He stated that these were always relieved by the discharge of matter, but the only source from which these discharges appeared to have taken place was a small abscess in the left tonsil. A sudden attack of extreme dyspnoea coming on, tracheotomy was performed, but the patient shortly after died. A drawing is preserved, No. 128. 1654. A Larynx, at the upper part of which there is a large and very firm tumour, probably an epithelioma. The tumour is attached by a broad base to the left upper border of the thyroid cartilage and to the adjacent tissue; it occupies nearly all the space between the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages, leaving only a narrow chink at the right side for the admission of air to the glottis. Its surface is irregular and slightly ulcerated. xxv. 28 From a man 60 years old. The disease had been in progress for at least fifteen years ; but its effects were not severe till shortly before his death. 1655. The Larynx, Pharynx, and base of the Tongue shown from behind. The base of the tongue, the tonsils, and portions of the larynx are involved in an epithelial growth. xxv. 35 Removed from a man in whom there was, likewise, an epithelioma of the scrotum. 1656. A Larynx, with some of the contiguous lymphatic glands. There is a flat spongy growth, probably an epithelioma, on the mucous membrane covering the epiglottis, and the superior orifice of the larynx. A part of this growth has ulcerated. A deposit of soft substance nearly fills the enlarged lymphatic glands. xxv. 22 MALIGNANT GROWTHS SECONDARILY IMPLICATING, OR COMPRESSING THE LARYNX. 1657. A Larynx with the adjacent structures. A ragged cavity of considerable size is seen by the side of the left thyroid cartilage. It communicated by a sloughing sinus with an ulcer of the integuments, and with the pharynx by a small aperture above the thyroid cartilage. The superior cornu of the os hyoides, rough and bare, projects into the cavity. The base of the ulcer of the integuments was hard, ragged, and made up of white curdy matter, containing well-marked cancer cells. The left lobe of the thyroid body was infiltrated by a similar growth, but the isthmus and right lobe were normal. The mucous membrane of the pharynx was natural. From a man, aged 57 years, who died in the Hospital. He had suffered for nine months from spasm of the glottis, frequent dyspnoea, and swelhng of the parts in front and to the loft, side of the neck. The induration was succeeded by a foul indolent ulcer. Death took place rather suddenly after a severe attack of dyspnoea. 1658. A Larynx and the adjacent structures. A hard cancerous tumour involves the tissues on the left side of the larynx and infiltrates the wall of the pharynx. The wall of the larynx is bulged inwards by the pressure of the tumour and the glottis is thereby considerably narrowed.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LAEYNX AND TRACHEA. 256 From a man, aged 63 years. Laryngeal symptoms had existed for about six months. Death took place after the performance of tracheotomy for the relief of dyspnoea.

The Lar}Tnx of a child 3 years old, who was suffocated by a pill lodging just beneath the vocal cords. Small portions of the pill lie loose at the bottom of the bottle, but the greater part of it has been dissolved by the alcohol; the mucous membrane is stained by it. xxv. 26 1661. A small rounded piece of cancellous Bone, rather larger than a pea; it is extremely light and the surface is slightly rough. It was coughed up by a gentleman twenty-three days after it had passed into the air passages. "While eating some veal he choked and afterwards felt a sensation " as if something were sticking somewhere," although he could swallow with ease. He passed a bad night suffering much from difficulty in breathing. In travelling to town next morning to consult a surgeon, the shaking of the railway carriage much relieved him. A distinguished surgeon, whom he consulted, told him that the bone had probably passed down, but that he seemed to have a cold. During the next week he suffered " as from asthma, the want of breath causing acute pain in mounting stairs." Lying on the right side invariably increased the wheezing and brought on coughing. Twice he had violent convulsive fits of coughing. Treatment was directed to the bronchitis which existed, but without relief. The cough became more trouble- some, and he could keep nothing on the stomach.

The first portions of the larger tubes are of their natural size, but as they pro- ceed in the substance of the lung, they become gradually wider; till near the surface of the lung they gradually contract, and appear to end in closed extremities. The walls of the dilated portions are thin, smooth, and not marked, as the others are, by the longitudinal elastic fibres projecting on their surface : the adjacent pulmonary tissue appears healthy. xiv. 54s Vide also the following specimen. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE BRONCHI. 1681. The lower part of a right Lung. Its pleural surface is closely invested with long-formed false membrane. Its vesicular structure is solidified, void of air, firm and greyish. On part of its cut surface are seen the orifices of numerous enlarged and sacculated bronchial tubes, the mucous linings of which are thick and fibrous. These tubes were filled with thick, greenish-brown material. They are the branches of the inferior divisions of the main branch of the lower lobe of the lung'; and in this, the trunk, from which they proceed, there is lodged a brass tip or ferrule of an umbrella-stick, which, though movable, completely fills the tube, and, being closed at its lower end, com- pletely prevented the transmission of air. xiv. 62 This foreign body was accidentally lodged in the bronchial tube three years before the patient, a boy 12 years old, was admitted into the Hospital. He was supposed to have swallowed it, for it produced no difficulty of breathing, either at the time or for many days afterwards. From the time of the accident, however, his health began to fail, and he was supposed to have phthisis; he forgot, or ceased to tell, that a foreign body might have passed into his lung. Thus he was brought to the Hospital, in a dying state, two days before his death. In addition to the changes here shown, there was a large gangrenous cavity in the apex of the right lung; the lower lobe of the left lung was solid, with pneumonia and with gangrenous softening, and in its upper lobe were numerous reddish spots with yellowish centres, as if from inflammation proceeding to suppuration. The case is fully related in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. vi. p. 187. 1681a. The Lungs of a Child. The trachea and bronchi are laid open alono- the anterior surface. The right bronchus immediately beyond the branch to the upper lobe of the lung contains a heart-shaped seed, which did not completely fill the tube. The lowest lobe of the right lung is completely collapsed, also the lower half of the middle lobe. The upper lobe contains air. The trachea and both bronchi contained much purulent fluid. The specimen was taken from a female child, aged 2 years, who without evident cause was seized with a severe fit of coughing, accompanied by distressing dyspncea and cyanosis, which lasted fifteen to twenty minutes. On the following day, the breathing was whistling, and the third day she had a second attack of dyspnoea and coughing, when she was brought to the Hospital. On admission she was extremely livid, and the respiratory distress was ereat Physical examination showed that the lower part of the right lung was collapsed and the heart, in consequence, drawn across to the right side.

With the exception of its upper third it is solid, and of a bright crimson colour, owing to the filling of its air-cells with coagulated blood. In the lower third there is a portion marked with black, pigment-like deposits, and circumscribed by a deep red margin.

In the adjacent part of the lung are two similar cavities of smaller size. The pleura is thinly covered by organized false membrane. X1V- From a boy, 15 years old, who died a fortnight after receiving a severe compound fracture of the skull, which was followed by hernia cerebri. No sign of disease of the chest was observed. He had extensive suppuration between the membranes of the brain. 1711. Portion of the upper lobe of a right Lung, showing Pyeemic Infarctus. One of these—the pleura covering it having sloughed—has burst into the serous sac, leaving an excavated space surrounded by softened lung tissue. The boy, aged 17, from whom this preparation was taken, died fifteen days after amputation of the left thigh. The left femoral vein was full of purif orm fluid, which had a free entrance into the blood. The bronchial glands, the liver, spleen, kidneys, and certain muscles were also the seats of infarcts, and the right hip, elbow, and left sacro-iliac joints contained purifurm fluid. 1712.

Section of a Lung, the whole substance of which is made solid by the infiltration of Tubercular Matter. The dark spots and lines visible in the yellow tubercular matter are produced by the small remains of the substance of the lung. There are also numerous small irregular cavities in the lung, the result of softening of the tubercular matter and ulceration. The boundaries of these cavities are formed by the tubercle softened and broken, and by the remains of the proper substance of the lung. xiv. 33 1722. Section of a Lung, the tissue of which is solid, heavy, and of a pale yellowish white colour, from uniform infiltration of Tubercular Matter. Its pleural surface is covered by a thin layer of tough, false membrane, with small tubercles scattered in it. xiv. 47 1723. Portion of a Lung, exhibiting an extensive destruction of its substance consequent on the formation and progress of Tubercle. The walls of the large cavity which occupies the place of more than half the lung, are composed of the pulmonary tissue, indurated and infiltrated with tubercular matter; and are rendered very irregular by the projection of numerous large branches of the blood-vessels, which have not been involved in the destruction of the adjacent parts. The pleura is thickened, and has soft false membrane on its surface. xiv. 34 1724. Portion of Lung, in which there are several large Tubercular Cavities, with infiltration and induration of the pulmonary tissue remaining between them. Most of the cavities are lined by false membrane in thin and imperfect layers. The pleura is thickened, and false membrane is abundantly formed upon its surface. xiv. 35 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 1725. Portion of the apex of the right Lung. It contains a portion of a Tuber- cular Cavity, sprouting into which is a small malignant growth, probably secondary to malignant disease of the right supra-renal capsule. Although the vomica itself was evidently of old date, the lungs contained throughout large quantities of miliary tubercle recently deposited, the appearances having been such as to lead to the belief that the diseases had been progressing simul- taneously.

Section of the upper part of a Lung, in which a soft material, resembling mortar and mixed with particles of calcareous substance, has been deposited in small cavities, which, it may be presumed, were previously occupied by tuber- cular matter. Sections of two cavities are seen filled with this substance ; two others have been partially emptied. The surrounding pulmonary tissue is condensed, dry, and of a dark grey colour, from the quantity of black matter deposited in it. The surface of the lung is deeply wrinkled and contracted over the remains of the cavities ; and several bands of false membrane are attached to it at the same part. xiv. 41, ^PLJEURA, BRONCHIAL TUBES, AND LUNGS. \< Froin a patient who died of a disease independent of this condition of his lungs, and from whom the specimen of partially healed tubercular ulceration of the large intestine, Series XVIII, No. 2016, was taken. 1727.

They were secondary to a similar growth involving the uterus. xiv. 75 The case is fully related by Mr. Callender in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. ix, p. 327. EPITHELIAL CANCER (Secondary). 1729. Portions of Lung, containing masses of Epithelial Cancer. In the lower por- tion au oval mass of the morbid growth, two inches in diameter, is imbedded in the lung, at its root, and a portion projects from it into one of the large bronchi. It is doubtful whether this mass is seated in the lung itself, or in a cluster of bronchial glands. In the upper specimen a mass of large size occupies the very substance of the lung, immediately beneath the pleura. In the interior of this mass is a large cavity, which was tilled with pus and softened cancei-ous matter, and has irregular broken walls formed by the less softened substance. The boundaries of the cancerous growths are well-defined, and the substance of the lungs in which they are imbedded appears healthy. They present a nearly white friable basis substance, soft but dry, marbled with lines and dots of black pigment matter, and (in the recent state) parts of them were suffused with pale yellowish and pinkish hues. In microscopic structure they presented the usual appearances of epithelial cancer, with abundant scale-like, wrinkled, nucleated cells, and epithelial laminated capsules. Xiv. 61 The patient was an old man, part of whose penis was removed, on account of cancer, eighteen months before death. The diseaso returned in the inguinal glands, and presented in them the same characters as it here shows in the lungs. Portions of the glands are preserved in Series XXIV, No. 2287. There were altogether about twenty cancerous masses. Most of them were in the right lung. Many were softened at their centres, or had cavities therein, like the largest here shown.

The adjacent tissue of the lung is healthy. xiv. 43 From the same patient as the sarcomatous tumours of the breast, Nos. 3163, 3164, in Series XLYIII, and No. 1903 in Series XVII. 1741. Section of both Lungs, and of the parts contained in the upper portion of a Posterior Mediastinum, all involved in a large New-Growth (? lympho- sarcoma). At and near the middle of the specimen appear the sections of the left bronchus, the arch of the aorta pushed to the left, the left vena innominata similarly displaced, the left pulmonary artery and veins. All these are much compressed by the cancerous mass surrounding them. Numerous bronchial glands, filled with cancerous matter, are imbedded in the same mass. Similar cancerous deposits in the right lung occupy nearly all its natural textures, leavino- only black lines and spots marking their former places and arrangement. The left lung (part of which is shown at the back of the specimen) was healthy. The New-Growth is milk-white, or greyish-white; in some parts firm, in others soft, and easily reduced to pulp. XIY- 68 The patient was a porter, 33 years old. He had had cough and dyspnoea for about twelve months • and, for about ten weeks, had increasing oedema, and other signs of venous obstruc- tion in the head, face, and upper extremities, which gradually extended to the abdomen and lower extremities. The only considerable disease, in addition to those mentioned above, was dilatation of the broncM of the right lung, which appeared like cavities filled with pus. The case is fully related in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. in, p. 183. 1742.

A portion of Lung, with the Pulmonary Artery laid open. One of the main branches of the pulmonary artery is obstructed by a large, firm, irregular, decolorised clot, extending to the termination of the branch, where a cavity containing broken down lung substance is seen, lined by a distinct opaque membrane. The lungs were emphysematous, dotted with tubercles, and scarred by old cicatrices. From a man, aged 65 years. He had been troubled with cough and shortness of breath for years, and was admitted to the Hospital six weeks before his death for apparent obstruction of the veins of the left leg. By rest he seemed to recover. After leaving the Hospital the symp- toms of obstruction—swelling and pain—returned, and soon sudden and distressing dyspnoea came on, of which he died.

Portions of the Left Lung of the man from whom Specimen 1595 in Series IX, was taken. Some of the larger branches of the pulmonary artery which have been laid open, show in their interior firm and partly decolorised clots. 1749. Portion of a Lung, in which the main division of the Pulmonary Artery is nearly filled by a firm, grumous, brown and red clot of blood, slightly adhering to its walls, and having all the characters of a clot formed before death. At its distal end the clot divides into four portions, which extend into and nearly fill as many branches of the pulmonary artery in which it lies. One of these portions is intimately united to the wall of the arterial branch in which it is contained. XIV 43 1750. Another portion of the same Lung. A bristle is passed beneath a narrow band, formed probably by the further organization of blood coagulated during life, within the branches of the pulmonary artery. One of two such bands is attached only at its ends to the inner surface of the branch of the artery : the other is attached by nearly the whole of one of its surfaces to the angle and adjacent parts of a large branching arterial trunk. The clots are firm and pale pink, and have completely coalesced with the wall of the artery. In some of the smaller branches of the artery there are short round grumous coao-nla, like those described in the last preparation. ° Xlv 49 The patient, a woman, 70 years old, died after suffering with an affection of the chest and oedema ot tbe lower extremities, for five weeks. Two days before her death she began to sink rapidly. Tbe case is related by Sir J. Paget, and the Specimen No. 1749 is figured in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxvii, p. 178, pi. iii, fig. 3. London, 1844.

The case is related by Sir J. Paget, in the Medico-Chirurgical Trans- actions, vol. xxviii, p. 353. London, 1845. 1754. Sections of the upper lobe of the Lung of a child, consolidated by in- flammation. The surfaces of the sections are minutely granular, of a pale, dirty yellowish-white colour, except in two or three places where there are traces of effused blood, and in those parts in which spots of black matter have been deposited. Some of the branches of the pulmonary artery are blocked up by fibrin. There are some thin deposits of firm lymph upon the surface of the pleura covering the upper section. xiv. 45 1755. Part of the lower lobe of the right Lung of a girl who died with an osteoid Tumour in the pelvis. The chief branch of the pulmonary artery is filled with a hard and partly bone-like substance, similar to that of which the gi'owth in the pelvis was composed. From the trunk, portions of similar but less ossified substance, extend into many branches of the pulmonary artery, filling them, and making them feel like hard cords. Many such branches are shown traversing a large cavity formed by softening and imperfect suppuration in the substance of the lung. Similar, but much less extensive disease existed in the left lung.

DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE NOSE, MOUTH, TONGUE, PALATE, AND FAUCES. DISEASES OF THE NOSE. LIPOMA. 1760. A pendulous Lipoma, which hung from the extremity of the nose and septum nasi. It is composed of tough fibro-cellular tissue. The specimen was removed from an Italian, aged 53 ; it had been growing since he was nine years old. A similar, but smaller tumour was attached to the upper lip.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 8. Vide Nos. 2705, 2706, Series XXXV. 1761. Lipoma, probably malignant, removed from a man, aged 20 years, on whose nose it had been growing slowly for twelve months without pain or glandular enlargement. The tumour occupied the whole of the nose from the nasal bones downwards. It was hard, of a dusky red colour, especially at the base, and covered with wart-like nodules. Much haemorrhage followed the operation. The exposed surface granulated healthily. xxiii. 35 THICKENING- OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 1762. Section of a Nose, in which the mucous membrane covering the posterior portion of the inferior turbinated bone is thick, soft, and spongy; so that in the recent state it resembled a vascular tumour or polypus projecting in the nasal passage. xxiii. 23 GLANDERS. 1763. Portion of the Septum Nasi of a Horse, exhibiting pustules and ulcers of the pituitary membrane. Each separate ulcer is small and circular; but on the posterior part of each surface of the septum there is a large extent of ulceration of an irregular form, probably the result of the coalescence of many small ulcers with each other. xxiii. 21 The disease was produced by inoculation with matter taken from an abscess in the arm of a man who was believed to have been infected by glanders. Previous to the inoculation the horse was healthy. POLYPI. 1764. Sections of a Nose, exhibiting on each side large soft polypi, which are suspended from the mucous membrane covering the inferior and middle spongy bones. One polypus of smaller size is situated in the frontal sinus. They we&re probably of gelatinous aspect, though now, having collapsed and fluid havino- escaped from them, they appear opaque. xxiii. 15 1765. Numerous Polypi removed from the Nose. They arc of soft texture,DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE 270 semi-transparent or gelatinous in aspect, and several of them were attached to the mucous membrane of the nose by long narrow pedicles. xxm. 7 1766. Polypi removed from the Nose. They are of firm semi-transparent texture, and, with the one which is suspended, a large portion of the inferior spongy bone is connected. xxm. 9 1767. Two Polypi, like those last described, attached by narrow pedicles to the inferior surface of the body of the sphenoid bone. xxm. 10 1768. A large lobed Polypus of soft texture, which was extracted from the nose. A portion of it which hung into the fauces is opaque, apparently from the thickening of its investing membrane; the rest is sof t and more nearly trans- parent. ° XXIIL 24 It was removed from a young lady in whom obscure signs of its existence had been loDg observed It was attached to the mucous membrane of the nose by the narrow portion by which it is now suspended. The larger part of it lay in, and projected from, the posterior aperture of the nostrils, through which also the whole mass was extracted by seizing the portion which was hanging in the fauces. 1769. A similar, but larger and more deeply lobed Polypus, which was also extracted through the fauces. xxm. 25 The patient was an elderly lady. She had long observed the disease, and had herself removed portions of the polypus, by seizing it with pincers whenever she could force it towards the cavity of the mouth, and cutting it with scissors. The part which was thus cut presents a cicatrised surface. 1770. The right side of a Child's head, in which the nasal passages are com- pletely filled by lobulated polypous growths from the mucous membrane. The section of one of the largest growths displays a pale, pinkish, and obscurely fibrous texture, firmer and less transparent than that of the common gelatinous -, • xxm. 16 polypi. ' The growth of these polypi was very rapid. They proved fatal by suffocating the child, for they filled the nasal passages and pressed down the soft palate so as to obstruct the fauces. TUMOURS OF THE ANTRUM AND NOSE. 1771 Part of the right side of a Face, in which the antrum and other nasal cavities and passages are completely filled by a soft medullary tumour, which also projects with an extensive sloughing surface through the skm of the cheek, and through the anterior part of the gum and of the hard palate. xxm. 8 1772.

The greater part of it occupies the situation of the superior maxillary bones, which are completely absorbed. Above, the tumour has extended through the left side of the base of the skull into its cavity, where it forms a large projection in the situation of the anterior lobes of the cerebrum; below, it is united to the soft palate; in front, it protrudes, distends the left nostril, and has caused the nlceration of a part of the integuments of the face. The outer surface of the tumour is nodulated; its interior, shown by the section, is formed of close- set nodules and masses of cartilage, partially and irregularly ossified, and inNOSE, MOUTH, TONGUE, PALATE, AND FAUCES. 271 some parts intersected by layers of a softer, probably fibrous, tissue.

Section of a Tumour removed from an Upper Lip. A portion of the mucous membrane of the lip is closely connected with a part of its surface. The tumour was of spheroidal shape, nearly an inch in diameter, imbedded in the whole thickness of the lip. It is lobed, firm, and elastic, closely connected, but not confused, with the adjacent tissues. Its cut surface is creamy-white and greyish, with ruddy spots. xxxv. 87 The patient was a healthy-looting, middle-aged man. The tumour had been growing for twelve years, and was inconvenient only from its bulk. Its microscopic structures were those of a conglomerate secreting gland, with tubes lined and partly filled with nucleated cells, wanting only the system of branching ducts. The case is described, and parts of the microscopic structures are represented, in Sir J. Paget's Lectures on Tumours, p. 262, pi. 36. EPITHELIOMA. 1777. An Epithelioma of the Upper Lip. xxxv. 22 Kemoved from a man, aged 60 years. 1778. Section of a mass of Epithelial Cancer imbedded in the right cheek. It occupies the whole thickness of the cheek, upraising equally the skin and the mucous membrane, and just projecting through them both at small ulcerated apertures. It appears as a circumscribed infiltration of the tissues, of irregular rounded shape, about two inches in diameter. Its section appears opaque-white, with some marks of blood-stains ; its substance is firm and close- textured, but friable, not creamy. xxxv. 96 The patient was 37 years old. A year before the removal of this disease, a portion of his lower lip, with an epithelial cancer which bad been four years in progress, was excised. Within three months of this second operation, the disease reappeared beneath the scar, and rapidly increased. It was removed, together with a large portion of the lower jaw to which the can- cerous substance adhered. The wound did not completely heal; but the cancer which again appeared in it made comparatively slow, though extensive progress. Death occurred nearly three years after the first operation. The lip on which the first operation was performed remained healthy to the last. There is a drawing of the specimen No. 578. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE TONGUE. HYPERTROPHY. 1779. A horizontal section of a portion of a Hypertrophied Tongue, removed272 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE by the ecraseur from a child, aged 3 years. The tongue had increased in size since the age of sixteen months. The portion removed always protruded from the mouth. The child never complained of it; could masticate without trouble and talk very well. The lower teeth, however, had become pushed downwards and pointed unnaturally outwards from the pressure above. The structure seems to be that of healthy tongue, with a thickened papillated mucous membrane. FATTY DEGENERATION. 1780. A Tongue reduced to fat from a case of progressive muscular atrophy. The subject was a man, aged 60, who had gradually lost health and strength for two and a-half years before death. At the same time speech and the first act of deglutition failed; he was compelled at last to communicate all wants in writing, and to force food within the grasp of the palatine arches after mastica- tion by means of a common spatula. The tremulous twitchings of the muscles of the tongue, and eventually of others, were remarkable. Becoming slowly emaciated from imperfect nutrition, he died without additional symptoms. The nerve-centres, the nerves, and the organs generally, were examined after death, and presented a natural appearance. The tongue is converted into a mass of fat, and some others of his muscles showed symptoms of the same disease in its earliest stage. xxiii. 32 Presented by Edgar Barker, Jun., Esq. ULCERATION. 1781. A Tongue, Larynx, and Pharynx. The dorsum of the tongue is occupied by a V-shaped ulcer, which extends along the raphe from base to tip. The ulcer is about a quarter of an inch deep ; the edges are steep, ragged, irregular, and infiltrated with tubercular matter. Its base is smooth; here and there the fibres of the transverse muscle are exposed. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the soft palate are covered by ragged ulceration, and the palate is much thickened and honey-combed by small abscesses containing cheesy pus. The root of the tongue is covered by a dense papillated cicatricial tissue, in places ulcerated. The tonsils are normal. The epiglottis is nearly destroyed; its remnant is contracted, dense, puckered, and adherent to the adjacent parts. Both arytamo-epiglottidean folds are destroyed by ulceration, and the mucous membrane covering the interior of the larynx above the glottis is infiltrated, and covered by a similar ragged tuberculated ulceration, which penetrates deeply on the anterior surface. The margin of the left vocal cord is ulcerated, but the right is unaffected. From a bov, a°-ed 19 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with an extensive superficial ulcer on the tongue and soft palate. He had had a bad mouth for two years and his tongue had been ulcerated during the last three months. There was no evidence of congenital syphilis The ulcer spread in extent and depth, and he died two months after his admission of hectic and exhaustion. The apices of both lungs were affected with phthisis. A drawing is preserved, No. 186.—See Pitcairn Ward Booh, vol. vi, p. 82. 1782. The rio-ht half of a Tongue, on the border of which is an ulcer, with an uneven, coarsely granulated base, and an inverted and somewhat undermined maro-in'. It has destroyed the whole thickness of the mucous membrane of the tongue, exposing, at irregular depths, the muscular tissue. xxiii. 28 The patient, a man 37 years old, died with advanced tubercular disease of the lungs and larynx The ulcer of the tongue was of eight months' duration. For a short time before his death it appeared to be healing ; but before this time it had presented so close a resemblance to the common tubercular ulcers of the intestines, that it was believed to be of tubercular nature. The co-existent disease in the lungs and larynx, and the absence of any cancerous structures near the ulcer, further justified this belief. 1783. A Tono-ne, the inferior part of which is, on the right side, completely273 NOSE, MOUTH, TONGUE, PALATE, AND FAUCES. destroyed by ulceration. Around the ulcerated surface, the muscular sub- stance is indurated, but has undergone no other obvious change of structure. xxiii. 12 The patient was a woman, 40 years old, who, till within four months of her death, when this disease was first observed, had had good health. 1784. A Tongue and Pharynx, exhibiting extensive sloughing of their mucous membrane, which was considered to be the effect of mercury administered to a syphilitic patient. xxiii. 17 TUMOURS. FIBROUS. 1785. A two-lobed Tumour, removed from a Tongue, in the substance of which it was imbedded, near the apex. It is about half an inch in diameter, and consists of a succulent, obscurely filamentous tissue, abundantly nucleated. xxxv. 77 The patient was a young man. The tumour was of three years' growth. CARTILAGINOUS. 1786. The halves of a small Cartilaginous Tumour, removed from the dorsum of the tongue, immediately beneath the mucous membrane. xxxv. 137 From a man aged 23 years. EPITHELIOMA. 1787.

TDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE 274 1790. Tongue of a man, aged 55 years, removed by Symes' operation of dividing the symphysis of the lower jaw, and excising the whole organ. The tongue is completely infiltrated with epithelioma, and a deep longitudinal fissured ulcer is seen on its superior surface. The disease had existed for nine months. See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. i, pp. 117 and 124. 1791. Cancerous ulceration of the tongue, from a man, aged 40 years, who died suddenly after one profuse haemorrhage. The disease had existed five months. The whole right half of the tongue has been destroyed quite to the root, and the surface of the ulcer was in a sloughing state. Immediately in front of the anterior palatine arch the ulcer communicates with a distinct cavity, with slough- ing walls, situated below the submaxillary gland and beneath the hyoglossus muscle. Into this cavity the lingual artery opens about three-quarters of an inch beyond its origin. A bristle has been passed from the carotid through the lingual artery into the cavity, and another from the cavity through the opening into the mouth. 1792. A Larynx, with part of the Fauces.

On two previous occasions masses like this had grown rapidly, and had heen removed. They were so slightly attached that they were peeled oil by scraping the surface of the tongue with the fingers. After the removal of this mass, which is of nearly the shape and size of the tongue itself, the disease was speedily reproduced, and ended fatally. Drawings are preserved Nos. 187, 188.

Its surface is covered by thick, but apparently healthy, mucous membrane; and its interior presents a lobulated appearance. XXIII. 22 1800. An elongated oval Tumour removed from the palate, to which it appears to have been attached by a broad base. It is composed of a firm, very close- textured, obscurely fibrous substance, with interspersed specks of bone, like the epulis which more commonly grows from the gums. XXIII. 6 DISEASES OF THE SOFT PALATE AND FAUCES. ULCERATION. 1801. The Larynx and adjacent parts removed from a man who died under the following circumstances:—He was a soldier, and was admitted into the Military Hospital with a sloughing ulcer of the throat, but without venereal taint. There was considerable loss of substance, and his condition for many days was most critical. He improved under treatment, and rapidly gained flesh. The ulcer appeared to be healing, and he was considered convalescent. While one day sitting up in the ward his mouth was suddenly filled with blood. He ejected about a pint of bright arterial blood, and died before he could reach his bed. On examination after death, it was found that, although the ulcer on the soft palate and back of the pharynx had healed, a small aperture existed behind the remains of the left tonsil which led downwards into a pouch of elongated form, the lining of which was still ulcerated. At the bottom of this pouch a small clot was found adherent, and by carefully tracing the branches of the external carotid it was found that the superior thyroid artery opened into the cavity, and thus caused fatal haemorrhage. xxiii. 30 TUMOURS OF THE SOFT PALATE. 1802. A small fibrous Tumour removed from the soft palate. 1803.

A Cartilaginous Tumour of the submaxillary gland, removed from a girl, 15 years of age, in whom it had been growing four years. The tumour consists chiefly of hyaline cartilage, in which were found traces of acinous gland structure.—See President Ward Bool, vol. v, p. 39 ; and Pathological Soc. Trans., vol. xxviii, p. 228. 1825. A Tumour removed from the submaxillary region in front of the sub- maxillary gland, on the right side of a man aged 26 years. It had been growing about five years, and consists of fibrous tissue, through which are scattered masses of cartilage and bone. 1826. A Tumour removed from the right submaxillary gland of a man aged 24 years, in whom it had existed for nearly five years. It is composed chiefly of gland tissue with delicate portions of cartilage interspersed here and there throughout its substance. TUMOURS OF THE PAROTID GLAND. 1827. Section of a Tumour removed from over the parotid gland of an apparently healthy woman about 30 years old. It is nearly pyriform, measuring about three and a half inches in length, and three inches in its greatest breadth. Its upper half is composed of white, semi-transparent, and compact cartilage; its lower half of a pale, obscurely fibrous, soft substance; a few small portions of cartilas-e are seen imbedded in the softer substance. The tumour had grown very slowly and without pain. It was loosely connected with the surrounding parts. 1828. Half of a large Tumour, removed from over a parotid gland. The tumour formed a somewhat kidney-shaped mass, with its concavity resting on the parotid gland and adjacent structures. It measured about six inches by five. It is composed of large lobes, the partitions between which are in many places ossified. Its cut surface has a generally ochre-yellow, or fawn-colour, varied with paler tints, and with small nodules of cartilage and small grains of bone imbedded in it. Its substance is very firm, hardly compressible, but easily rending or breaking. A few small cysts lie scattered in it, and a large cyst, filled with fluid, was connected with a part of the tumour not shown here. xxxv. 83 The patient was a woman 65 years old. The tumour had heen slowly increasing for thirty- three years ; and within the last year the skin over it had ulcerated, allowing a portion of it to protrude. It reached from just below the ear to the lower part of the neck, overhanging the280 DISEASES OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS. clavicle ; it extended forwards nearly to the median line, and backwards nearly to the margin of the trapezius. The patient's general health was not materially affected by it, and she recovered after its removal, but a portion left in the operation subsequently increased rapidly, and then ulcerated, and by discharge and pain, destroyed life in about twelve months. 1829. Section of a Tumour, of the same kind as that last described, and also removed from over a parotid gland. It is oval, deeply knobbed, measuring about an inch and three-quarters by an inch. In general aspect its cut surface resembles that of the preceding tumour. It is more distinctly shown to be invested with a thin layer of fibro-cellular tissue. xxxv. 84 The patient was a woman 48 years old. The tumour had been increasing, without pain, for three years. In microscopic structure it consisted of a tissue like that of glands, and of cartilage, with groups of well-formed cartilage cells, and of free stellate and spicate nuclei. Some of its constituents are represented in Sir J. Paget's Lectures on Tumours, fig. 25, p. 177, and fig. 30, p. 203. 1830. Section of a Tumour of the same kind, removed from a similar situation. In this, however, the cartilaginous predominates over the glandular constituent of the morbid structure. xxxv. 85 The patient was a woman 25 years old. The tumour had been observed twelve months. Its increase was regular and painless. About six weeks after this operation, another tumour of the same kind appeared, which was removed after eleven months' growth. No subsequent growth occurred for at least three years. The microscopic characters of this tumour were essentially similar to those of the last described. 1831. The half of a Tumour, probably of the same kind as the three last described, and, like them, removed from over the parotid gland. It differed from them, how- ever, in that its texture was, in the recent state, soft and flickering, and, on its cut surface, brightly shining and translucent. It was like soft and nearly diffluent cartilage, arranged in minute clustered lobes, and presenting various shades of grey, pale yellow, and light blue and pink. It was very easily broken or crushed, but yielded no creamy or other fluid. It was of oval form, and loosely connected with all the adjacent parts. xxxv. 86 The patient was a woman 26 years old. The tumour, commencing without any known cause, had been seven years in progress, and in the last year had grown very quickly. It felt, during life, like a cluster of enlarged, soft, lymphatic glands, elastic, compressible, easily movable. The patient recovered after its removal, and remained well for at least eighteen months. The chief microscopic structures of the tumour were like clusters, or acini of gland- cells, with intersecting fibro-cellular tissue and fine flat filaments. Its appearance in the recent state is shown in a drawing, No. 547. Presented by Mr. Barber. 1832. A Tumour which was removed from the right parotid region. The surface is largely nodulated and surrounded by a definite capsule. The tumour is composed of a yellowish-white, moderately soft material, having somewhat the appearance of cartilage. Near the centre is a small cyst, probably formed by mucoid degeneration. There is also a tendency to the development of small cysts in the softer parts of the growth. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour presented a mixed character. In some parts traces of newly-formed gland tissue are seen. The bulk of the tumour is made up of ill-developed connective and mucoid tissue, in which fasciculi of spindle-cell tissue and groups of round cells are scattered. . , From a man aged 56. The tumour commenced fifteen years before admission to the Hospital as a small lump ; it grew slowly at first, but latterly increased in size much more rapidly. ' It was circumscribed, and not adherent to the skin or subjacent parts. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 82. N.B.—For Salivary Calculi, see Series LIII.SEEIES XV. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. DILATATION OF THE OESOPHAGUS. 1833. An (Esdphagus with a portion of the Stomach. A dilatation of the oesophagus commences immediately below the larynx, and gradually increases to its termination in the stomach. In its lower half it measured nearly six inches in circumference. In the upper part of the dilated oesophagus the lining membrane is sound; in its lower half, the greater part of this membrane is superficially ulcerated, and shreds of it hang in the iuterior of the tube. Just above the stomach, the complete removal of the lining membrane exposes the muscular fibres of the oesophagus, which are here, and on every part of the canal, hypertrophied. The cardiac orifice was free; and the stomach was healthy. XXIV. 12 The patient was 20 years old. He had had signs of this disease for ahout eighteen months before his death, with frequent sickness about two hours after taking food, pain and tenderness in the epigastric region, and a feeling as if his food stopped at the lower part of the oesophagus. He died with peritonitis. 1834. Annular contraction of the (Esophagus at its cardiac extremity as it passes through the diaphragm. Above this point the canal is greatly dilated, and the muscular portion of its wall is hypertrophied. The disease had existed for several years. 0,5 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION", &c. EFFUSION OF LYMPH. 1835. An (Esophagus, in which the whole of the mucous membrane is lined by a uniform thin layer of lymph. Strips of the lymph, which is soft as if recently effused, are reflected. In the portion of the pharynx which is preserved lymph of the same kind is deposited in separate patches. xxiv. 6 The patient was a man 35 years old. He died on the seventh day of his illness of acute pleuropneumonia No signs of this affection of the pharynx and oesophagus had been observed during life; and it is not probable that he bad taken any large quantity of antimony. 1836. An (Esophagus, with a portion of the Stomach. The inner surface of the oesophagus is covered by lymph, deposited in strips corresponding with the wrinkles of its lining membrane. Portions of the lymph have been detached • and the subjacent membrane appears unaltered. XXIV -q There was no reason to suppose that this deposit of lymph was occasioned by poison.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. 282 DIPHTHERIA. 1837. Membranous Films removed from the mucous surface of the pharynx. Similar ones extended into the larynx. One of these is preserved, and shows that the disease involved the bronchial tubes. The films are opaque, firm, and tough. They do not present any recognizable structure, but consist of granular matter, exudation corpuscles, with traces of imperfect filaments. xxiv. 23 From a case of diphtheria. ULCERATION. 1838. Part of a Pharynx and (Esophagus, with the Larynx. The mucous mem- brane of a part of the pharynx and oesophagus is destroyed by ulceration. The surface of the ulcer is uneven and ragged, and in one point marked by a bristle ; the ulceration extends through the adjacent lateral wall of the trachea. xxiv. 7 SYPHILITIC ULCERATION. 1839. The Base of a Tongue, with the Pharynx and other adjacent parts. A large portion of the mucous and submucous tissues of the pharynx, and of one margin of the epiglottis, is destroyed by sloughing and ulceration. The mucous membrane covering the upper part of the larynx is cedematous and, in some parts, superficially ulcerated. xxiv. 8 From a girl who was greatly debilitated by the effects of syphilis and mercury. SIMPLE STRICTURE OF THE CESOPHAGUS. 1840. A Pharynx and (Esophagus, with the Larynx and other adjacent parts. Just below the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, the canal of the oesophagus is reduced to a quarter of an inch in diameter, and appears flattened from before backwards. The tissues for some distance around this part are thickened, indurated, and consolidated. The mucous membrane of the anterior wall of the pharynx above the stricture is ulcerated, and appears cedematous, as if an abscess had been discharged through it. Below the stricture the oesophagus is healthy. XXIV- 1 1841. Portion of an (Esophagus, showing a marked narrowing of the canal. The mucous membrane is firm, dense, and some cicatrices are seen on the surface, but there is no evidence of a new growth. From a woman, who died of pneumonia. She had long suffered from dysphagia, supposed to be clue to a malignant growth in the oesophagus. Vide also No. 1834. MORBID GROWTHS, &c. CANCER. 1842. Epithelioma of the Pharynx. A large cancerous tumour springs from the ri^ht side of the pharynx, at, the level of the upper part of the larynx. In the natural state of the parts, the tumour almost completely occluded the canal of the oesophagus. During the last month of life deglutition was less difficult than beforehand small pieces of meat were sometimes swallowed. The patient was 41 years of age. He died after a long illness with abscesses in the lungs and right arm. 1843 A Pharynx, with the soft Palate, and part of the base of the skull. The upper part of the pharynx is completely filled by a nearly globular growth of soft medullary substance, with a warty surface. The growth appears to have had its orio-in in the walls of the pharynx, from which it projects, not only into the pharyngeal cavity, but also forwards into the mouth under the soft palate, and backwards towards the spine. xxiv. 5 The patient was not aware of the existence of the tumour till within a few weeks of hisDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. 1848. An (Esophagus from a man, aged 56, showing an epithelial cancer in a admission into the Hospital, at which time it was nearly as large as it now appears. It often bled : mid destroyed life by the hemorrhage, and by the impediment which it caused to both deglutition and respiration. A part of the same tumour projected through the basdar portion of the occipital bone, and extended along the outside of the oesophagus, where it was connected with enlarged Lymphatic glands full of soft medullary matter. 1844. A Pharynx and Larynx, with the base of the tongue and other adjacent parts. A large ulcer, destroying a great part of the lower portion of the pharynx, has extended into the trachea directly below the cricoid cartilage. The right half of the cricoid cartilage is denuded, and separated from its con- nections with the upper ring of the trachea ; on this side also a portion of the thyroid cartilage is exposed. The margins of the ulcer are sharp and abrupt; its base is irregular, and was covered with a soft creamy matter, containing, probably, the debris of epithelioma. xxiv. 18 The patient, a woman, 36 years old, was in good health until fifteen months before death. She then began to have pain and difficulty in deglutition. These symptoms increased for nine months ; and then her voice became hoarse, and she had frequent cough without expectoration, especially on any attempt at deglutition. In a few weeks she had considerable haemoptysis ; and this recurred daily, and as often as, in examination of the throat, the thyroid cartilage was pressed. The case is related by Dr. Jeaffreson in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. ii, p. 51. 1845. The (Esophagus of a man, aged 38, on whom gastrostomy was performed one week before death (see specimen, Series XVII, No. 1950). In its course is a broad ring of epithelial cancel', smooth on the outside, but superficially ulcerated on the mucous surface. The stricture produced by it was nearly complete ; water would pass through only drop by drop. Above the stricture, the oesophagus was only slightly dilated, and elsewhere was quite healthy. The pneumogastric nerves were involved in the cancerous mass. On the upper curve of the stomach, at the pyloric end, was a small nodule of epithelial cancer ; no cancerous deposits were found elsewhere. The case is related in the Transactions of the Clinical Society, vol. v, 1872. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 195. 1846. An (Esophagus, surrounded for about three inches of its length by a firm mass of cancer, which commences four inches below the cricoid cartilage. The bifurcation of the trachea, and the bronchi are adherent to, and partially im- bedded in, the anterior surface of the growth: the descending aorta is adherent to its left side ; its posterior surface was adherent to the vertebrae. The section of the tumour presents a dense fibrous aspect. An ulcerated canal large enough to admit a No. 10 bougie passes through the growth; nearly all trace of the normal structure of the oesophagus is here lost. Below the tumour the mucous membrane of the oesophagus is infiltrated in streaks, which extend as far as the cardiac orifice ; there are also small patches and sub-mucous nodules of the growth. The bronchial glands were infiltrated, as were also some of the medi- astinal ; two of these lying to the right of the trachea are preserved. The larger compressed the bracheo-cephalic vein, which was filled by a recent clot. Gastrostomy was performed. The stomach is preserved in Series XVII, No. 1951. 1847. The lower half of an (Esophagus, with the cardiac portion of the Stomach. Within and just above the cardiac orifice there is an annular, flat, spono-y growth, probably of medullary substance, ulcerated m its centre; by which growth, as well as by the thickening and contraction of the surrounding tissues the termination of the canal of the oesophagus is reduced to a very small calibre' Above the stricture the oesophagus is dilated, its muscular coat is hypertrophied" and its mucous membrane appears cedematous, and is at one part superficially ulcerated.

At one part the coats are entirely perforated, and the tube^ of the oesophagus communicated with an ulcerated cavity which lay in the tissue of the posterior mediastinum in contact with the right lung. No disease was found elsewhere. xxiv. 24 The case is described by Dr. Balyin the Transactions of the Pathological Society of London, vol. x, p. 165. 1849. The lower end of the (Esophagus and cardiac orifice of a Stomach, affected with cancer. The cardiac orifice is narrowed from the protrusion of the gastric wall by the new growth, and only admits the little finger. Secondary deposits of cancer were found in the liver, and the lumbar, bronchial, and cervical glands were infiltrated. From a man aged 40 years.—See Post Mortem Bool, vol. vii, p. 116. 1850. An (Esophagus and Stomach. The lower third of the oesophagus and a large portion of the stomach near its cardiac orifice are ulcerated through the whole thickness of their walls. The margins of the ulcers are sinuous, very abrupt and ragged, and present the general aspect of cancerous disease. xxiv. 4 1851. Portion of an (Esophagus and Stomach, showing a large cancerous ulcer extending for some distance above and below the cardiac orifice. • From a man, aged 54 years, in whom symptoms of the disease had existed for nine months before death.—See Pitcairn Ward Boole, vol. ii, p. 334. 1852. A Larynx, with part of the Trachea, Pharynx, and (Esophagus, from a man ao-ed 49 years. The specimen shows a large ulcer, two inches across, nearly "surrounding the gullet, possessing very thick cancerous margins, and opening into the trachea by an aperture the size of a sixpenny piece. It was on a level with the top of the manubrium sterni. xxv. 43 See Post Mortem Book, Case 246, July 27, 1871. 1853. Part of an (Esophagus, with the Trachea and Bronchi. Opposite the bifurcation of the trachea, the walls of the oesophagus are nearly surrounded by a firm cancerous growth. The surface of this growth, where it projects into the oesophagus, is ulcerated; and ulceration, penetrating at one part through its whole thickness, has extended into the right bronchus, in the course indicated by the piece of quill. xxiv. 3 1854. The (Esophagus and Cardiac Orifice of a Stomach, showing extensive can- cerous ulceration, and infiltration, and consequent narrowing of the oesophagus. An ulcerated perforation of the wall of the oesophagus at its lower end is seen, which led into a gangrenous patch in the base of the right lung. The cardiac end of the stomach is thickened and corrugated. Secondary deposits of medullary cancer were found in the liver, but the lymphatic glands of the abdomen and thorax were not enlarged. From a man aged 68 years—See Post Mortem Bool, vol. vii, p. 107. OTHER MORBID GROWTHS IN, AND AROUND THE 03SOPHAG-TJS. 1855. Part of an CEsophagus, in which nearly the whole of the submucous tissue is occupied by a substance resembling that of colloid cancer. In many places the mucous membrane is upraised, with a low tuberculated surface, by the colourless and nearly pellucid clustered cystic growths beneath it; and, at one part, a globular mass of the same structure, about two-thirds of an inch in diameter, is suspended from the sub-mucous tissue into the cavity of the oesophagus. xxiv. 19 Presented by Sir John Forbes.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. 285 1856.

R. Farre, Esq., M.D. PERFORATION OF THE OESOPHAGUS BY ABSCESS, ANEURISM, &c. 1859. An (Esophagus, Trachea, and adjacent parts, exhibiting the remains of an abscess, which had formed in the deep cellular tissue of the neck, and had burst in two directions, namely, through the upper part of the oesophagus, and through the right pleura into the cavity of the chest. A bougie indicates the course of the abscess on the inner side, and across the front of the sheath of the carotid artery and jugular vein. xxiv. 14 The patient was a strong man 31 years old. He was admitted into the Hospital with pneumo-thorax on the right side and general emphysema. After his death it was stated that he had had pain in his throat and difficulty of swallowing for some time before those symptoms ensued which indicated the penetration of the pleural cavity. 1860. Part of an (Esophagus and of a Trachea. Below the division of the latter the pressure of an aneurism has caused ulceration of the outer walls of the oeso- phagus, so that the mucous coat is exposed, and alone prevented perforation of the canal. 97 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. POST-MORTEM DIGESTION OF THE OESOPHAGUS. 1861. An (Esophagus, with a small portion of the Stomach. About half the cir- cumference of the walls of the oesophagus, at its lower end, is thin, soft, and pulpy, and in the centre of this part there is a large aperture with ragged floc- culent margins, partially blackened. The adjacent parts of the oesophagus and stomach are healthy. xxiv. 10 . It is probable these changes were produced after death by the action of the gastric fluid. 1862. An (Esophagus, with a portion of the Stomach. There is almost entire destruction of the coats of the oesophagus, for three inches above the stomach, and in nearly the whole circumference of the tube. The portion of the oeso- phagus which remains in this situation is pale, soft, and pulpy. The stomach appeared healthy. xxiv. 13 From a child who died in consequence of an accidental injury. No sign of affection of the stomach had existed before death, and the characters of the changes indicate that they were the result of the action of the gastric fluid after death. Vide No. 1864.

Both286 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND OESOPHAGUS. layers of the muscular fibres of the oesophagus are torn through at their connection with those of the stomach ; and, by their retraction towards the upper part of the oesophagus, its submucous tissue is exposed over the whole extent of its last four inches. A similar retraction of the muscular fibres on the fundus of the stomach has taken place, exposing a large portion of its sub- mucous tissue. There is a small laceration of the mucous and submucous tissues of the oesophagus about two inches from the cardiac orifice. xxiv. 9 The patient was a man 65 years old. For about a year before bis death he had dyspepsia, and was believed to have stricture in the lower part of the oesophagus, for which probangs were passed. He was subject to vomiting, and could not swallow anything solid. He felt the rupture of the oesophagus during a slight act of vomiting, thirty-six hours before death. Great visceral disease is stated to have been found after death ; but there is no appearance of stricture or of any change of structure having existed in the oesophagus previous to the rupture. Presented by Beriah Brook, Esq. 1864. The (Esophagus and Left Lung. About one inch below the level of the cricoid cartilage a small glass rod is passed through an aperture on the anterior surface of the oesophagus, leading into a channel formed by the separation of the longitudinal from the transverse layer of muscular fibres. The channel communicated below by two openings immediately above the diaphrao-m with the left pleural cavity, and by another with the lower part of the canal of tbe oesophagus: into these apertures portions of glass rod are inserted. Immediately below the upper aperture described, three flat condy- loma-like growths project from the mucous membrane of the gullet; otherwise there was no obstruction of its canal. At the lower part of the oesophagus there are two large openings, one above the other, apparently produced by post mortem digestion. The left pleura is covered with lymph and there was some pleurisy at the base of the left lung. From a child aged 2 years. Catheters were passed down his oesophagus on account of difficulty in deglutition, occurring nine weeks after he had swallowed some oil of vitriol. A slight contraction of the oesophagus was felt. A few hours after the passage of some gum elastic catheters down the gullet under chloroform, the mother brought the child back to the Hospital, stating that it had been very ill since recovering from the chloroform. Ihe child was admitted and died on the second day Prom pleurisy.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vn, p. 33. 1865. Ulceration of the CEsophagus with constriction of the canal. A bougie passed clown to the stricture perforated the oesophagus, and passed by the side of it as low down as the diaphragm. 96 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. IMPACTION OF FOREIGN BODIES IN THE CESOPHAGUS. 1866 Part of an (Esophagus and Pharynx with the surrounding structures. At the commencement of the former, just below the level of the cricoid cartilage, a fragment of bone, fixed across the axis of the canal, has its pointed ex- tremities imbedded in the ulcerated and sloughing mucous membrane. On either side of the pharynx are cavities which contained pus, surrounded by slouching tissue. One of these, on the right side, extends between the oesophagus and the trachea. These abscesses communicate freely with the ulcers which surround the impacted extremities of the foreign body. xxiv. 22 Removed from the body of a man who had swallowed the fragment of bone nine days before death The probang, when introduced, slipped past it over its posterior border, so that, during fife, no certain indication of its presence was obtained. 1867 A Heart, Pericardium, and CEsophagus.

The bone was m a positionLawrence Ward Book, 1867, p. 7. I DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE PHARYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. 287 directed obliquely upwards and forwards, and it transfixed the diaphragm. On the upper and back part of the wall of the left ventricle, half an inch to the left of the posterior interventricular septum, and corresponding in position to the point where the fish-bone projects from the pericardium, there is a lacerated wound of the heart, consisting of two punctures placed side by side which extend about a quarter of an inch into the ventricular wall, but do not penetrate it. The parietal and visceral layers of pericardium m the neighbour- hood of the wound are discoloured and covered with lymph. The heart is dilated and flabby. The parts were taken from a man, aged 59 years, who came to the Hospital stating that he felt a fish-bone sticking in his throat. He complained of pain over the centre of the sternum. On the previous evening he had eaten some fish while partially intoxicated. A dilating horse-hair probang was passed by the house-surgeon. On leaving the Hospital he was very faint and complained of pain in the region of the heart. He took to his bed and on the following day appeared rather better, but vomited all his food. On the evening of the third day he suddenly expired. The pericardium was found distended with blood-stained serum and contained some blood-clot. See an account of the case in the Clinical Soc. Trans., vol. xiii, 1880, by Mr. Eve. 1868. A vulcanite Tooth-Plate, which was swallowed by a man. It lodged and remained firmly fixed in the oesophagus a little below the cricoid cartilage. Extraction was effected by means of the grapnel probang, but with great difficulty and only on exercising considerable force. 1869. A gold Palate-Plate with four incisor teeth and having two sharp hooks on either side. The plate was swallowed by a young lady aged 21, while taking a ' pill. It lodged in the oesophagus, from whence efforts were made to remove it, without success. Operative interference was refused. She suffered from difficulty and choking during deglutition, and became extremely emaciated. Two years and eight days after swallowing the plate she vomited after inhaling some chloroform for the relief of pain, and without effort brought the plate up.—For account of case see Lancet, July 19th, 1879.

The yellow discoloration stops abruptly with an irregular jagged border at the commencement of the stomach, the epithelial and mucous coats of which are wanting, its surface being rough, and of a brownish-red colour. xxiv. 20 Prom the body of a man who died fifteen hours after drinking one ounce of strong nitric acid. A drawing of the stomach and oesophagus is preserved in the Museum, No. 211; and the case is fully described in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. v, p. 247. C3SOPHAGOTOMY. 1871. The upper part of the OEsophagus, with the Larynx and part of the Trachea, from a woman, aged 48 years, upon whom cesophagotomy was per- formed for a cancerous stricture, which extends from the junction of the oesophagus with the pharynx upwards for about an inch. Below the stricture the tube is quite healthy. The operation wound, which may be seen to be directly below the stricture, is set open with a bristle. The patient had suffered for seven months before her admission into the Hospital with dysphagia, and had become greatly emaciated. Nothing larger than a No. 8 bougie (urethral, could be passed through the obstruction, the commencement of which could be felt by the finger passed through the mouth into the pharynx. After the operation a full-sized tracheotomy-tube was introduced through the wound. Through it the patient took food well, and in all ways made very favourable progress for a week, when she refused food and medicine, and, getting weaker, died exhausted on the sixteenth day after the operation.—SeeSERIES XVI.

Microscopical examination showed it to be a fatty tumour, with a great excess of connective tissue. xvi. 144 The patient was a boy 14 years old. He had suffered from attacks of severe colic for two years before death; the attacks became more and more severe, and of longer duration the last attack before the fatal one lasting five weeks. The fatal attack began twenty-two days before death, and had all the characters of ileus, with visible movements of the intestines fsecal vomiting, and constipation. At the post mortem examination the tumour was found compressing the lowest part of the small intestine. The kidneys were in their natural position and, excepting the ileus and its accompaniments, the body was perfectly healthy. ' Presented by Dr. Burd, of Shrewsbury. 1885. Portion of large Intestine.

POST MORTEM DIGESTION. 1895. The Stomach of a Child, presenting the appearances produced by digestion acting after death on the walls of the organ itself. There are four large irre- gular apertures through the coats at the great end and middle of the stomach. The edges of these apertures are soft and flocculent, and the remaining mucous membrane of the adjacent parts is soft, pale, and almost gelatinous in its appearance. xv. 8 The child was 10 years old, and died, after a short illness, with inflammation of the trachea. 1896. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting attenuation, with paleness and softening, of a part of its great arch. The dark streaks in the altered portion of the stomach are produced by the blackening of the blood coagulated in its vessels. xv. 13 It is probable that these changes were occasioned by the action of the secretions of the stomach upon its coats after death. 1897. Parts of a Stomach and a Diaphragm, exhibiting the effects of the action of the gastric fluid after death. The greater part of the fundus, or cul-de-sac, of the stomach is destroyed, and a large aperture through the walls has been here made by the action of the digestive fluid. The borders of the aperture are formed by soft, flocculent, and shreddy tissue ; and the mucous membrane adja- cent to it is soft and pulpy, as if nearly dissolved. In the pyloric half of the stomach little change appears, but in the diaphragm there are large apertures by the side of the left lobe of its tendinous centre, whose soft shreddy margins indicate that they were produced by the digestive power of the fluid escaping from the stomach. xv g-j The parts were taken from a fat woman, 60 years old, who died about twenty-four hours alter a fit of apoplexy, which produced immediate and continued unconsciousness. In the afternoon, just previous to the fit, she had eaten more food than she had for some time pre- viously been able to obtain ; and she had vomited after the fit. The body was examined forty hours after death. The case is in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Meporis, vol. vii, p. 39. 1898. Digestion of part of the wall of a Stomach immediately below the oeso- phagus. The mncous membrane is soft and jelly-like, and the walls are extremely thin over a considerable extent. A circular opening allowed the gastric contents to reach the diaghragm, which was soft and eroded opposite the aperture. There were no adhesions of the peritoneal surfaces. 98 The patient died suddenly one hour and a half after dinner. Five days previously he fell and suffered from a slight concussion. The digestion of the stomach was the only post mortem condition noticed. J 1 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. U 2292 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE STOMACH. 1899. Portion of a Stomach, in which there is an aperture with a dark discolora- tion of the membrane, around it. The discolored portion is very thin, and the aperture in its centre has ragged edges. xv- It is uncertain whether these changes are due to ulceration, or to the action of the secretions of the stomach after death. POST-MORTEM DIGESTION, AND HHEMORRHAGIC EROSION. 1900. Part of a Stomach, in which one-half of the mucous membrane is made thin and pale by digestion after death, and the other half is the seat of nume- rous minute « follicular " ulcers. The ulcers, or " hemorrhagic erosions, are from half a line to two lines in diameter, generally oval or circular, like little shallow pits in the mucous membrane. There is no apparent change ot struc- ture in the tissues round or beneath them; but the base of each ulcer was darkly blood-coloured, through the small quantity of blood extravasated into rt. The patient, an intemperate man, 50 years old, died with general dropsy cirrhosis of the liver enlarged heart, and congested spleen and kidneys He was out of health for five ye**T to hi! death, and was subject to "bihous attacks," and to gout. His case is related m the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. x, p. 243. HEMORRHAGIC EROSION. 1901. The cardiac portion of a Stomach, with the lower part of the oesophagus. There are six superficial ulcers of irregular shape, and from two lines to halt an inch in width, in the mucous membrane just below the cardiac orifice, ineir margins are clearly defined, their bases smooth, and of a deep black colour from blood effused in and upon them, and discoloration by the action of the gastric fluid. All the adiacent textures of the stomach appear healthy. In the lower part of the oesophagus the epithelium has been removed; its blood-vessels are m many parts intensely congested, and the blood in them is deeply blackened^ ^ From an elderly man who died with granular disease of the kidneys, dropsy, and enlarged heart without any probability of having taken poison, and without having exhibited any remarkable signs of disease of the stomach. 1902. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting numerous small ulcers in the mucous membrane. The ulcers are from half a line to a line in diameter, round, oval, and angular in form; and some of them were, in the recent state, black, pro- bably with effused blood. xv" 4 From a woman to whom small doses of arsenic had been administered for a fortnight, on account of a cutaneous affection. The mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines appeared highly vascular. 1903. Portion of a Stomach, in the mucous membrane of which there are numerous circular ulcers. They vary from half a line to two lines in diameter, and penetrate the whole thickness of the mucous membrane, which m the inter- vening spaces appears healthy. Many of them in the recent state contained points of effused blood. XV- From a woman, 45 years old, from whom the sarcomatous tumours of the breast in Series XLVIII, Nos. 3163 and 3164, were taken. PUNCTIEORM HEMORRHAGE. 1904. A Stomach, laid open by an incision along the great curvature. There is capillars congestion of the mucous membrane. Numerous punctiform haemor- rhages are scattered over the stomach in the neighbourhood of the great curva- ture • they are most numerous on the anterior surface. The mucous membrane was covered by a layer of viscid mucus mixed with altered blood, and much re- sembled the condition seen in poisoning by oxalic acid. From a girl aged 11 years.

Thickening of walls of the Stomach, consequent upon chronic peritonitis. The stomach is reduced to the calibre of an ordinary large intestine; the walls are nearly half an inch thick. The mucous membrane is intact, but at one place there is a polypus the size of a horse-bean. The stomach was strongly adherent to all the parts around; the cardiac orifice would just admit a large probe and no more. One inch short of the pylorus all the thickening ceases, and the organ rather rapidly assumes a natural appearance. The patient died from pulmonary phthisis. The intestines were ulcerated. ULCERS OF STOMACH. 1908. Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting a general thickening of its coats, with ulceration. The ulcer is of an oval form; its edges are smooth and abrupt; its base is hollow, but smooth; the tissue around it is elevated and deeply wrinkled. xy g 1909. A Chronic Ulcer, occupying the posterior wall of the stomach close to the pyloric orifice. The edge of the ulcer is at one part cleanly cut and steep, at another bevelled, and the mucous membrane is slightly everted. The mus- cular coat of the stomach is exposed in the centre of the ulcer. The pyloric orifice was narrowed, apparently from the thickening of the mucous membrane and the stomach was dilated. From a man, aged 45 years, who for two or three years vomited, every two or three days a large quantity of brown fluid ; he never vomited blood. Death took place from exhaustion. 1 Presented by J.

The Pyloric portion of a Stomach, with the commencement of the Duo- denum. About two inches from the pylorus, in the lesser arch of the stomach, is an ulcer which has penetrated through all the coats. In the peritoneal coat the aperture is oval, abrupt, and sharp-edged; that in the mucous membrane has similar characters, but is much larger; the sides of the ulcer shelve smoothly and gradually from the aperture in the mucous, to that in the peritoneal coat. Around this ulcer are several of smaller size and irregular in form, which have removed only the mucous membrane. Their margins are clean and abrupt, and their bases are smooth. The intervening tissue appears healthy. xv. 25 1912. Portion of the anterior wall of a Stomach, in which there is an oval ulcer, like that in the preceding specimen. The form of the base of the ulcer indicates that it made progress from the mucous to the peritoneal coat, by several distinct steps or stages. xv* ^9 From a girl, 20 years old, who, while in apparently good health, was suddenly attacked hy acute peritonitis, and died in twenty hours. Presented by J. F. Harding, Esq. 1913. The Pyloric extremity of a Stomach. There is a deep ulcer, one and a half inches long by two-thirds of an inch broad, situated about one inch from the pylorus on the posterior surface near the lesser curvature. The edges of the ulcer are thickened and overhanging, and on the floor, partly formed by the pancreas, the extremities of two blood-vessels filled with clot are seen. A con- traction of the stomach was produced by the ulcer to such an extent that only the little finger could be passed through it. The pylorus, at the lower part of the specimen, is laid open. From a woman aged 54 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with vomiting about one hour and a half after food, tenderness over epigastrium, and haematemesis. About twenty-two years before she bad an attack of vomiting after food, which lasted a few weeks, and she had had similar attacks of varying duration every few years, but without bsematemesis.—Matthew Ward Book, vol. viii, p. 197.

Portion of a Stomach, exhibiting a large ulcer with cleanly cut margins, which at the upper part has penetrated the wall of the stomach by two irregular openings. There is another smaller, elongated, but deeper ulcer nearer the pyloric orifice. The wall of the stomach, especially the mucous membrane, is much thickened. A piece of glass tube is inserted into the cardiac orifice. From a man. aged 57 years, who had been already ill nine months before his admission to the Hospital, with pain in the abdomen, constant pyrosis, but without vomiting of food.—See Matthew Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 355. Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 370 ; and Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxxi, 1881. 1915. Part of a Stomach, with small portions of the Liver and Pancreas adherent to it. There is a large and deep oval ulcer just below and to the right of the cardiac orifice of the stomach, which has extended into the pancreas, destroying in its progress a portion of the splenic artery. A bristle is introduced into the ulcerated orifice of the artery, from which fatal haemorrhage took place into the cavity of the stomach. XY- 14 1916. Ulceration of the Mucous Membrane lining the Stomach. In its progress, a considerable artery, indicated in the preparation by a bristle, was opened, and the patient died from the consequent haemorrhage. 99 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1917. Stomach of a man, aged 22, who died from typhoid fever. The intestinal ulcers had perforated the bowel, and vomiting was a marked symptom of the peritonitis consequent upon the perforation. In the smaller curvature of the stomach areDISEASES AND INJURIES OP THE STOMACH. 295 three patches in winch the mucous membrane is of a dull white colour, obviously sloughed: these sloughs being quite contiauous with the surrounding mucous membrane. The size of each slough was equal to a sixpenny piece. Around each of these was a dark hyperaemic ring, and several large vessels were connected with each spot, Besides these sloughs, there are two ulcers of about the same .size, but perfectly clean and with sharply cut edges. There seems to be little doubt that these appearances were due to simple gastric sloughing and ulcera- tion in the earliest stages, and not to any specific lesion. The stomach was full of altered blood.—See Post Mortem Bool; vol. ii, p. 306. CICATRISATION OF ULCERS. 1918. Part of a Stomach, with the scar of an ulcer in its mucous and sub-mucous tissues. The place of the scar is marked by radiating wrinkles of the mucous membrane, which converge to it. The membrane itself, both at and around the Bear, appears healthy. The ulcer was probably a simple chronic one, such as in Kos. 1910 and 1911, &c, has proceeded to perforation of the stomach. MORBID GROWTHS. POLYPUS. 1919. A Stomach, exhibiting numerous pendulous and lobulated growths, like polypi, springing from its mucous membrane. They apparently consist of a tissue similar to that of the membrane itself.

In several other parts the peritoneal coat is irregularly torn. xv. 22 These injuries were produced by the crushing of the abdomen, the stomach at the time being full of food. EFFECTS OF POISONS. Mineral Acids. 1940. The Stomach of a person who died in consequence of having taken sulphuric acid. ^ The deep red colour, mottled with black, and extending throughout the interior of the stomach, is occasioned by blood effused from the eroded vessels and acted on by the acid. The greater part of the mucous membrane is destroyed, and the surface exposed is rough and shaggy. In the oesophagus and near the pyloric end of the stomach, portions of the mucous membrane remain, and are red, thick, and corrugated. XY< 9 The duodenum of the same patient is in the next Series, No. 2042. 1941. A Stomach from a young woman, exhibiting the effects of sulphuric acid. There is an aperture with ragged edges, about half an inch in diameter, in the middle of the great arch of the stomach. The mucous membrane around the aperture is thickened, black, and charred by the acid. The stomach is closely contracted. xy j*g 1942. The Stomach of a young woman who died thirty hours after taking nearly an ounce of sulphuric acid. It is contracted, and, in its interior, deeply corru- gated. The mucous membrane is thickened and indurated, and of a deep black and crimson colour from congestion and extravasation of blood. These effects of the acid are most distinct on the summits of the ridges formed by the corrugated mucous membrane. £^ 23 1Q43. The Stomach of a woman who died ten days after taking sulphuric acid Fart ot its mucous membrane is soft and of a dirty ash-brown colour, and near its pyloric end a portion between three and four inches in diameter has slouched and, except at one margin, has been completely separated. The slough hano-s loosely; it is very soft and flocculent at its edges, and of brown and yellow colour. About the cardiac orifice of the stomach (which is shown at the back of the preparation) there is a rough and somewhat granulated surface, from which a layer ot mucous membrane, after sloughing, completely separated. xv. 27 A drawing is preserved, No. 215. 1944. Part of the (Esophagus of the same patient, exhibiting an extensively and298 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE STOMACH. irregularly ulcerated surface from which a slough of mucous membrane sepa- rated. The destruction has been most extensive in the lower part of the oeso- phagus, the ulcerated and granulating surface of which was continuous with that of the cardiac orifice of the stomach shown in the preceding preparation. Part of the slough, a portion of which includes the whole circumference of the lining membrane of the oesophagus, is suspended in the upper part of the bottle. xv. 28 It is uncertain how much sulphuric acid the patient swallowed. She lived ten days, and appeared to have recovered from the effects of the poison, when she died with bronchitis. 1945. Two portions of blood clot vitrified by sulphuric acid. They were taken from the inferior vena cava of a man who swallowed about a pint of sulphuric acid. A considerable part of the stomach was destroyed and the acid escaped into the abdominal cavity and penetrated its contents.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. vii, p. 103. 1946.

Stomach with adjacent portions of abdominal and thoracic walls, from a man, aged 38 years, on whom the operation of gastrostomy was performed one week before death, on account of cancerous stricture of the oesophagus. The position of the external wound may be best appreciated by observing its relation to the umbilicus and to the cartilages of the ribs, both of which are preserved in the specimen. The stomach is firmly united to the margins of the skin wound, and the skin wound, above and below its connection with the stomach, has healed. The sutures remain in situ.—See specimen, Series XV, No. 1845. The case is related by Mr. Thomas Smith in the Clinical Society s Transactions, vol. v, 1872. 1951. A Stomach. About two and a half inches from the pyloric orifice, and rather nearer the lesser than the greater curvature is the vertical opening, with the integuments still attached to the margin, which was made in the operation of gastrostomy. The stomach was loosely glued to the parietal peritoneum, except on the left side of the opening; but the adhesions have now given way from the soaking to which the specimen has been subjected. Froma man aged 55 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with a cancerous stricture of the tpsonhaeus which had prevented his taking solid food for a fortnight. Dyspepsia had existed about one month A probang could not be passed. Gastrostomy was performed at the left linea semilunaris, and the stomach was attached to the sides of the wound by silver sutures, but was not opened until nine days later. The patient died exhausted on the third day after this operation. No evidence of peritonitis existed. Secondary nodules of hard cancer studded the surface of the lungs. a -rr . 1Tr j -n i i *e The oesophagus is preserved in Series XV, No. 1846.—See Kenton Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 75.SERIES XVIII.

Some of the latter are raised above the surface, as if on pedicles. XVI F2ECAL FISTULA, AND ABSCESSES OPENING- INTO THE INTESTINE 1959. A Caecum, with parts of the ascending Colon, and of the abdominal wal300 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. from the right inguinal region. The portion of glass marks the track of a large abscess, which at one extremity communicated by two apertures with the intestine, and at the other end opened by extensive sloughing through the groin and scrotum. The edges of the apertures in the intestine are soft and shreddy : the parts adjacent to them are not thicker or harder than usual: but near the uppermost of them is a circular spot, in which the coats of the intestine are thin and soft; at this part the mucous membrane only remains: its inner surface is smooth and polished. XVI- 70 The patient was a man 38 years old. The history of the case, as well as the appearances here shown, make it probable that there was first an abscess in the iliac fossa, which, opening into the cajcum, permitted the escape of faeces, and sloughing of the tissue extending from the iliac fossa through the groin into the scrotum followed. 1960. A Cfficum, with a portion of the abdominal walls from the right inguinal region. The anterior part of the csecam is united to the peritoneum lining the adjacent muscles; at this part also the mucous membrane of the caecum, is removed, and irregular fungous growths occupy its place. A fistulous canal, through which a quill is passed, extends from the cavity of the caecum through the middle of the growths, and through the adjacent parts of the abdominal walls. xvi. 28 The patient was a man 35 years old. An abscess in the groin had existed, it was believed, previous to the ulceration through the caecum. There was similar ulceration, with fungous growths, in parts of the small intestine. 1961. A Caecum, with part of the Colon. There is a round ulcerated aperture through that portion of the wall of the caecum, which was connected with the iliac fossa. On the exterior of the wall, the margins of the aperture are uneven and ragged; on its interior they are smooth and clean. The portion of tissue which is attached to the exterior of the caecum around the aperture was part of the wall of a large abscess. The rest of the mucous membrane and the other coats of the caecum are healthy. 83 The patient, an elderly man, had undergone the operation of lithotomy a week before death. Suppuration by the sides of the bladder and rectum, and all round the cavity of the pelvis, followed ; and, extending into the iliac fossa under the pelvic fascia, some of the pus discharged itself through the fascia into the caecum a short time before death. 1962. The sigmoid flexure of a Colon, into the cavity of which an abscess opened from without. The abscess was seated in the cellular tissue connecting the outer part of the intestine with the wall of the abdomen, and a part of its cavity which is very irregular in form, is shown at the back of the preparation. Portions of whalebone are passed through two short fistulous canals by which the abscess opened into the intestine. The apertures through the mucous membrane are oval and regular: their borders are sharp and even ; and there is no thickening or other morbid change in the adjacent coats of the intestine. xvi. 73 The disease was not observed during the life of the patient, who was a man about 30 years old, and died of pulmonary phthisis. The rest of the intestinal canal was healthy. ULCERATION OF THE INTESTINE. FOLLICULAR AND SIMPLE ULCERATION. 1963. Portion of a Colon generally thickened, and exhibiting numerous minute ulcers of its mucous membrane. xvi. 29 1964 Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting a broad, smooth-based ulcer of its mucous membrane, and a portion of omentum firmly adherent to its exterior in the situation of the ulcer. xv1, ^DISEASES AND INJURIES OP THE INTESTINES. 301 PERFORATING ULCERS. 1965. Portions of a Duodenum and Stomach, from a young man. A circular ulcer with smooth abrupt margins has completely penetrated the coats of the duodenum close to the pylorus. XVI* The patient had a hernia, and the signs of peritonitis, produced by the escape of the contents of the duodcuum through the ulcer, so nearly coincided with an apparent increase ot the protrusion, that it was supposed that the hernia had become strangulated. Previous to the perforation of the intestine, the patient had been subject to dyspepsia. He died about fourteen hours after the commencement of the peritonitis. 1966. The commencement of the Duodenum and pyloric orifice of the stomach. About half an inch beyond the pylorus there is a small ulcer, which has perforated the duodenum. The mucous membrane around the ulcer is thickened. From a man, aged 22 years, who had suffered from pain after food for four months. Finally, a sudden acute attack of pain was followed by peritonitis, and death within twenty- four horn's.—See Path. Soc. Trans., vol. xxxi, 1881. Presented by Dr. Norman Moore. 1967. A large Ulcer of the Duodenum. The ulcer is situated just outside the pyloric orifice of the stomach, on the lower and anterior surface of the duodenum. The base of the ulcer, which is much more extensive than the orifice, is formed almost entirely by the pancreas, which has become dense and cicatricial from the formation of connective tissue. At the lower and anterior part of the ulcer, in front of the pancreas, is a perforation which was the cause of death. On microscopic examination, the base of the ulcer was found to be formed of cica- tricial tissue alone. There was no evidence of a new growth. The patient was a gentleman, 56 years old, who for two or three years before his death suffered at first occasionally, and later almost daily, from pain to the right of the epigastrium about two hours after a full meal. Occasionally there was an exacerbation with pyrosis. Shortly before death he had several severe attacks of nielsena and occasional vomiting, the vomit containing sarcinse ventriculi. The patient had constitutional syphilis. Presented by Mr. F. S. Eve. 1968. A convolution of the Jejunum. An irregular ulcer of uncertain nature completely through the coats of its two contiguous and adherent portions. xvi. 14 ULCERATION FOLLOWING BURNS AND SCALDS. 1969. A Duodenum, with part of a Stomach. There are two oval ulcers about half an inch in diameter, and many of smaller size, in the mucous membrane of the duodenum. The two large ulcers have extended beyond the mucous mem- brane, and penetrated all the coats of the intestine. One of them is closed by the contiguous adherent surface of the pancreas: the other opened into the cavity of the abdomen.

XVI- From a patient who died with dysentery at the General Penitentiary, Millbank. 1974. Part of the Large Intestine from a boy. It presents the ordinary characters of dysentery in its early and acute stage. 111 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1975. Portion of a Colon, from a case of dysentery. Small portions of the surface of the mucous membrane, of various forms, are removed by ulceration. All the ulcers are situated on the free margins of the transverse folds of the mucous membrane, and by the sides of the lines formed by the longitudinal bands of muscular fibres. Their form is generally oval, or elongated m the direction ot the transverse folds. 1976. Another portion of the same Colon, from its lower part. By the extension of such ulcers as are shown in the preceding specimen, nearly the whole surface of the mucous membrane is removed. Portions of it remain hanging m shreds : and in some places the ulceration has extended to the muscular coat lhe coats of the intestine were soft, easily torn, dark, and infiltrated with dirty- coloured fluid. From a patient in the Penitentiary, Millbank. The whole length of the colon was similarly diseased, the extent of the disease increasing from the upper to the lower part. Presented by Dr. Baly. 1977. Portion of a Colon, in which the mucous membrane is extensively and rao-o-edly ulcerated. Large pieces of its remains hang in shreds m the cavity of The intestine. Many small distinct ulcers, also, may be seen, the result apparently, of disease of the follicles of the intestine. XVL 11 From a man who died with dysentery of long continuance.

Farre, Esq., M.D. ENTERIC FEVER. 1988. Portion of small and large intestine, from a girl, aged 12, who died from enteric fever, on about the twelfth day of the disease. The jejunum was natural. Nearly all the solitary and lymphatic follicles of the ileum were found more or less swollen, the swelling becoming more and more marked towards the ileo-csecal valve. Near the valve the swelling is extreme, but there is no trace of ulceration. The mesenteric glands were much swollen. The large intestine was natural.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. iii, p. 99, 1872. 1989. The lower portion of the Ileum with the ileo-caecal valve. The mucous membrane is thickly covered by characteristic typhoid ulcers, on many of which the slough is still attached. Ulcers extend along the whole length of the margin of the valve. From a young man, who died on the tenth day of enteric*fever, which he took while in the Hospital. 1990. The lower portion of an Ileum, with part of a Colon, from a patient who died in an early stage of the fever. Patches of Peyer's glands at the end of the ileum, and many of the solitary glands in the colon, are much enlarged, soft, and prominent above the surrounding surface of the mucous membrane ; but there is scarcely any appearance of ulceration or sloughing. The mesenteric glands also are enlarged and soft. xvi. 87 1991. Ulceration of Peyer's patches and Solitary Glands associated with enteric fever. The ulcers are small, but deeply excavated, and are surrounded by thickened tissue. 115 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1992. A somewhat similar specimen, in which, however, the ulcers are less excavated, and the thickening around less considerable. 116 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1993. The lower part of an Ileum, exhibiting enlargement and elevation of the patches of Peyer's glands, with sloughing and ulceration of small portions of their surface. Some of the sloughs, incompletely detached, are infiltrated with faecal matter. The portions of intestine intervening between the patches appear healthy. XYI 20 From a patient who died with enteric fever. 1994. A Caecum with a portion of the Ileum, exhibiting enlargement and sloughing of the Peyer's and Solitary Glands. Many of the glands are simply enlarged ; others have sloughed with portions of the tissue in which they lie •304 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. and in most instances the sloughs appear to have been in process of detach- ment. There are also several nlcers in the caecum and its appendix. xvi. 48 From a case of enteric fever. 1995. A similar specimen. xvi. 49 1996. The termination of an Ileum, with the adjacent portion of the Caacum. The mucous lining of the small intestine is ulcerated. Some of the ulcers involve the solitary glands, others the Peyer's patches. The latter are laden with sloughs, formed of the mucous and sub-mucous coats, infiltrated with granular lymph, and at points discoloured from adhering faeces. The edges of the ulcers are irregular, raised, and everted, and the mucous membrane around, inde- pendently of the solitary glands, appears swollen and cedematous. The largest ulcer involves one surface of a cusp of the ileo-crecal valve, and termi- nates abruptly at the margin, and fails to implicate the side which is continuous with the lining of the large intestine. xvi. 125 From a case of enteric fever. 1997. Portion of Ileum from a case of enteric fever. Most of the Peyei*'s and solitary glands, with their investing and connecting tissues, have sloughed. Some of the sloughs have been separated, leaving nearly smooth ulcers based on the sub-mucous tissue ; others remain still attached, dark and soft. The borders of the Peyer's patches, and of the smaller ulcers, are, for the most part, raised, inverted, and overhanging, as if in progress of healing. But, in one of the Peyer's patches (the fourth from the top), the ulceration has made further progress, and perforated the intestine. xvi. 97 1998. Ulceration of the Intestine in Enteric Fever. Irregular sloughs hang from the ulcerated surfaces. 117 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1999. Portion of an Ileum, from a case of enteric fever, exhibiting an ulcerated surface of the mucous membrane after the detachment of numerous sloughs like those in No. 1993. xvi. 22 2000. Portion of an Ileum, from a case of enteric fever. Sloughs, including large portions of two patches of Peyer's glands, have been separated, and other portions, nearly detached, hang in loose shreds into the cavity of the intestine. The surface, exposed by the separation of the sloughs, is formed by the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, which appear healthy, and is surrounded by a thin overhanging border of apparently healthy mucous membrane. Several small ulcers, remaining after the complete separation of sloughs of the solitary glands, are situated between the two principal ulcers. xvi. 79 Presented by Dr. Hue. 2001. The lower extremity of the Ileum, showing extensive ulcerations, the consequence of enteric fever, by which the circular muscular fibres are exposed. At one point a circular opening, an inch in diameter, marks the destruction of the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. Here the faeces escaped into the cavity of the peritoneum, and gave rise to fatal peritonitis. A few shreds of lymph are attached around the serous aspect of this aperture.—See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. ix, p. 31. xvi. 117 2002. The last eight inches of an Ileum, in which there are several large circum- scribed ulcers of the mucous membrane. The ulcers are nearly circular, and from a quarter to three quarters of an inch in diameter; some have coalesced, and formed large and less regular ulcers. The bases of the ulcers are smooth and level, and formed by the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, which appear healthy; their borders arc bounded, and to a small extent overlapped by305 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. the adjacent mucous membrane, which, except in being rather thickened, appears to have preserved its natural textnre. xvi. / 5 It is probable, as well from the history of the case as from the characters of the specimen, that these ulcers were formed by the separation of sloughs of Peyer's glands, in the course of enteric fever, and were in progress of healing. 2003. Portion of an Ileum, from a case of enteric fever. Three patches of Peyer's glands are enlarged, and small portions have separated by sloughing from their centres. There is also a general enlargement of the solitary glands, which project like little conical papules from the surface of the mucous mem- brane, xvi. 88 2004. Portion of a Colon, in which there are several small ulcers of the raucous membrane, remaining after the separation of sloughs in a case of enteric fever. The bases of the ulcers are formed by the circular muscular coat of the in- testine, which appears healthy; their margins are formed by thin portions of raucous membrane overhanging their bases. The intervening mucous mem- brane and other tissues appear healthy. xvi. 89 2005. Portions of an Ileum, in which two small ulcers, like those last described, have nearly healed. The muscular coat cannot be seen at their bases, and their margins, which probably were overhanging but have united to their bases, are smooth and shelving. xvi. 90 2006. Another portion of the same Ileum, in which are several similarly healed small ulcers, and one of larger size, in which a further process of ulceration has extended from the middle of the base of the ulcer in the mucous membrane, through the muscular and peritoneal coats, forming an elongated oval opening by which the intestine communicated with the cavity of the abdomen, xvi. 91 The four preceding specimens, and No. 1990, were taken from patients who died with enteric fever at Vienna.

Portion of Small Intestine, with tubercular ulcers extending completely around its canal; their surfaces are rough and irregular, their edges raised above the level of the adjacent membrane. Tubercles are deposited around, and in the tissues between the bases of the ulcers and the peritoneal coat, projecting in whitish masses upon the serous surface. At two points the ulcers have all but perforated the coats of the intestinal canal.—See St. Bartho- lomew's Hospital Reports, vol. vi, p. 239. XVI- l"'* 2013. A specimen similar to the preceding, but the lower and central ulcers have partially healed, and in the upper two, small perforations exist. xvi. 105 2014. Portion of a Jejunum, with a tubercular ulcer of its mucous membrane. The ulcer is of an oval form, and penetrates, at one point, the coats of the intestine. There are small tubercles beneath the corresponding portion of the peritoneum. XVI- ^ 2015. Portion of a Jejunum, in which a tubercular ulcer has completely per- forated its coats, making an aperture nearly half an inch in diameter at the bottom of an ulcer of rather wider extent. At the upper part of the intestine there is another ulcer, which has at one part extended through the muscular, as well as the mucous, coat. The peritoneal coat of the intestine is thinly covered by soft lymph. XVI- ' ^ 2016. Portion of a Colon, in which a large superficial ulcer has nearly cicatrised. The healed surface is contracted and irregularly wrinkled; and there are several small oval apertures in it, which have smooth margins and edges. xvi. 71 From a patient, 50 years old, in whose lungs there were several masses of calcareous sub- stance, and dry grey tubercles, but who died of a disease independent of the condition of both the lungs and the intestines. Part of the lung is preserved in Series XI, No. 1726. SIMPLE STRICTURE. 2017. Portion of a descending Colon, the canal of which is at one part suddenly reduced to a quarter of an inch in diameter. Its walls at this part are slightly thickened and indurated, and a narrow band passes across its canal, dividing into two small apertures the orifice by which the portions above and below the stricture communicate. The appearances are as if there had been an ulcer^ of the mucous membrane, the healing of which had been attended by contraction of the surrounding intestinal walls and adhesion of a part of its opposite surfaces. Both above and below the stricture the tissue of the colon appeared healthy : but its canal below was very small, while above it was enormously distended with faeces, and burst about two inches from the stricture. xvi. 82 The patient was a lady about 30 years old. She had been for three years subject to occasional attacks of obstinate constipation, which were generally followed by diarrhoea. Four months before her death, the obstruction of the intestines became complete, and after this time she had no ftecal evacuation. The cause of obstruction was found to be a cherry-stone which had lodged above the stricture in the colon, and completely closed the canal. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 2018. Stricture, apparently non-cancerous, of the ascending Colon, five inches from the ileo-csecal valve. The canal is contracted very considerably, and307 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. there is superficial ulceration of the mucous surface of the intestine around the orifice of the strictured portion. From a female, aged about 55, who for about five months before death had suffered from frequent constipation, with vomiting and abdominal pain and distension. For fifty-one days before death there was no action of the bowels, except in the expulsion of gas, nor was any food taken into the stomach for the same period. She drank at intervals a little brandy and water, w ine and water, and lemona.de, occasionally a little orange juice, and the juice of a few grapes. Almost every day she vomited bile with tlie " secretions of the stomach." There was no sign of peritonitis, nor of peritoneal adhesions ; no enlarged lymphatic glands ; no deposit in the liver. The limbs were much wasted; but there was a considerable amount of fat on the abdomen, and in the mesentery and meso-colon. Presented by Mr. Briscoe. Vide Nos. 1986, 1987. MORBID GROWTHS. FIBROUS TUMOUR. 2019. Fibrous (?) Tumours in the Ileum, causing partial obstruction of the bowel and a pouch-like dilatation above them. From a woman, aged 43 years, who died from pyaemia. The case is fully described in the Medical Times and Gazette for March 3rd, 1.866. CANCER. 2020. A portion of Intestine from the lower part of the Sigmoid Flexure. The canal is almost obliterated by a growth from the mucous membrane around the whole circumference of a limited portion of the bowel, about one inch in length. A passage not larger than a crow-quill still exists through the centre of the growth. The microscope showed that the growth was a cylindrical-cell cancer. From a woman, aged 69 years, who died soon after the performance of colotomy for the relief of chronic intestinal obstruction. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 86.—See Lawrence Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 458. 2021. Portion of the Sigmoid Flexure dilated, but not materially hypertrophied, above an annular stricture of the intestinal canal. Below this stricture is a crop of exuberant granulations, springing from an irregular, warty, ulcerated surface. At the point of stricture the walls are thickened and infiltrated with a scirrhous deposit, upon which has grown the soft medullary mass seen below. A bougie is passed through the narrow portion of the canal. xvi. 127 2022. Portion of Jejunum and two portions of Ileum. In each portion of intestine there is a circular constriction by which the canal is almost completely closed. At each of the constricted parts there is a cancerous growth springing from and infiltrating the wall of the intestine in a narrow band, extending around the whole circumference of the mucous membrane. Above each of them the intestine is widely dilated, its coats are generally thickened, and the muscular coat especially appears hypertrophied. XVl. 7 The patient, a woman, 37 years old, suffered for throe years before death with attacks of constipation and severe pain in tlie abdomen. The strictures were about two feet distant from each other ; and there was another besides the three here shown. Presented by John Bury, Esq. 2023. Part of the Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon, laid open. A soft villous malignant growth springing from the mucous membrane, surrounds and almost obliterates the canal.

On dissection it was found that the transverse colon had been drawn down in the shape of a V, by a piece of omentum that was adherent to the sac of an old left femoral hernia. The colon thus displaced had, on the occurrence of obstruction at the sigmoid flexure, become enormously distended, and at length the softened coats had given way by a large, thin-edged ulcer, through which fa?cal matter bad freely escaped into the peritoneal cavity.—See St. Bartholomevfs Hospital Reports, vol. iv, p. 262 ; Post Mortem Book, 1867, p. 14. 2024. Portion of a Colon, with Medullary Tumours projecting into its cavity. The largest of these growths forms a broad band round the whole interior of the intestine, and must have almost completely obstructed the canal. Its texture is broken and flocculent. The adjacent walls of the intestine are thickened, but their texture does not appear altered. xvi. 25 2025. Portion of the Sigmoid Flexure of a Colon, presenting^ an annular con- striction, at which its canal is reduced to a quarter of an inch in diameter. The constriction occupies about half an inch of the length of the canal; on its exterior it is marked by a drawing inwards of the wall of the intestine, as if a cord had been tied round it; the mucous membrane is slightly raised and villous. A piece of omentum is adherent to the exterior of the intestine at the strictured part; and all the tissues engaged in it appear indurated and confused. xvi. 98 2026. Portion of a Jejunum, with several small, disk-shaped, masses of medul- lary substance projecting into its canal from the sub-mucous tissue, in which they appear to have their origin. They are covered by mucous membrane. J rr xvi. 19 2027. A Mass of New Growth, probably malignant, surrounding the small intestine and adjacent portion of the caecum. 127 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2028. Portion of a Colon. In the greater part of its extent, the sub-mucous coat is from one to two lines in thickness, and of close fibrous texture, elevating the mucous membrane into irregular folds. The section of the muscular coat exhibits numerous white bands intersecting a dense greyish structure, the surface of which has a somewhat glistening aspect. xvi. 23 Taken from the same patient as the scirrhous cancer, No. 1923, in Series XVII. COLLOID CANCER. 2029'. An Ileo-csecal Valve, with parts of the Caecum and ascending Colon. The several tissues forming the valve appear thickened and indurated with morbid deposit, which, in the recent state, had the characters of colloid cancer. The surface'of the mucous membrane is roughly ulcerated. Similar disease, in less degree, exists in the immediately adjacent walls of the caecum and colon. The aperture of the valve is an oval opening, about one quarter of an inch m diameter, apparently fixed in both size and form. xvi. 120 The patient was a woman 31 years old. The first signs of intestinal disease, con- sisting of frequently recurring severe spasmodic pains in the abdomen, were observed a month before death. Three weeks before death, constipation, which had not previously existed, began ; and it continued to the time of death. Presented by Mr. Dickinson. INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 2030. Portion of an Ileum, the cavity of which is distended by an oval biliary calculus, two inches and a half in length, and an inch and a half in diameter. The peritoneal coat of the distended part of the intestine is ruptured; and the other coats are thin and tense. xvi. 84DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. 309 The patient was a lady, 62 years old, who had perfectly good health till within live days of her death, when she was attacked hy vomiting and constipation. These were relieved on the third day, but shortly recurred, and she died tympanitic with complete intestinal obstruction. The calculus here shown had passed through a large ulcerated opening from the gall bladder into the ileum. The other large calculus which lies loose in the bottle had passed through another ulcerated aperture into the colon, and was found in the csecuin. Presented by John Havers, Esq.

An Appendix Vermiformis, in which a mass of hardened faeces is lodged. xvi. 30 From a child who died with acute peritonitis. 2032. Appendix Vermiformis, from a man, aged 43 years, who died of abscess in the brain and liver. The point of a pin may be seen protruding from it into the caecum, while the head is imbedded in a mass of hardened faeces. There was no sign of ulceration, or of either recent or old peritonitis. 2033. A Caecum ; the sharp point of a nail protrudes through an ulcerated aperture in the vermiform appendix. The head of the nail lies in the termina- tion of the cul-de-sac, which is filled by some firm material. There was a small collection of pus around the protruding nail, but no peritonitis. Three or four small abscesses were found in the brain; one in the left centrum ovale being as large as a hazel nut. There were also abscesses in the bases of the lungs and purulent infarcts in the liver. From a woman who was admitted to the Hospital with moderate pyrexia, and complaining of pain in the left side and headache ; the two latter symptoms had existed three weeks. A fortnight later vomiting and delirium came on, shortly followed by unconsciousness with tetanic convul- sions, and death.—See Elizabeth Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 144. 2034. A Caecum, with its Appendix. The appendix is dilated and its walls are thickened. In the middle of its course there are two large ulcerated apertures penetrating its coats ; which apertures, it is presumed, were the consequence of the lodgment of a gall-stone in its cavity. xvi. 65 From a man 38 years old. The gall-stone became lodged in the appendix nine davs before death : it produced peritonitis, and complete obstruction of the intestines for four davs before death. " Presented by H. Bateman, Esq. 2035. A Caecum and Vermiform Appendix.

Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting a complete transverse rupture of its coats. A thin shred alone connects its two portions. XVI- 51 The injury was the result of external violence in the same person as the ruptured Vena Cava, in Series IX, No. 1607 ; and the ruptured Bladder, in Series XXIX, No. 2441. 2041. Mesentery and portion of Small Intestine from a boy, aged 11 years, who fell between the side of a cart and its wheel, and was dragged along for some distance. He died from peritonitis, and on examination a rent of the mesentery was found, about three and a half inches m length. The coil of intestine corre- sponding to part of the rent in the mesentery was folded on itself, of a dark claret colour, sodden and oedematous, and united to the adjacent parts by bands of recent lymph'. This portion of intestine looked as if dead; and it seemed doubtful whether its condition was due to altered blood-supply in consequence of the rent in the mesentery, or to direct injury. The sub-peritoneal tissue of the abdominal wall situated over the portion of intestine was infiltrated with blood. EFFECTS OF POISONS. 2042. A Duodenum, exhibiting the effects of sulphuric acid. The mucous membrane is very dark with congested vessels and effused blood ; it is, in some situations, corrugated; in others, completely destroyed. xvi. 45 From the same patient as No. 1940, in Series XVI. 2043. Portion of the Jejunum of a man, aged 29 years, who twelve hours before death had swallowed about three ounces of commercial nitric acid, the stomach being empty. The surface of the mucous membrane has lost the bright scarlet colour, which it had before immersion in spirit, but the corrugation of the membrane is well shown. 2044. Portion of large Intestine, from a patient who died fourteen hours after swallowing a large quantity of liquor ammonia3. The mucous lining is of a deep crimson colour, and in places there are considerable portions which seem to be bared of epithelium, as after vesiccation. Some of the discoloration was due to the escape of altered blood into the sub-mucous tissue. There was an abundance of fluid blood in the alimentary canal. These conditions prevailed in, and from, the stomach to the upper part of the rectum.—See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xvii, p. 301. xvi. 129 A drawing is preserved, No. 219.SERIES XIX. DISEASES OF THE KECTUM AND ANUS. PROLAPSUS. 2045. A prolapsed Rectum. The mucous lining of the most dependent portion is much thickened, forming a great part of the fibro-cellular mass which pro- truded through the anus. A section has been made through the anterior wall, showing this thickened portion, in which numerous clots of blood are con- spicuous, and denote the situation of dilated hemorrhoidal veins. xvi. 119 ULCERATION. 2046. The Rectum of a girl 25 years old. Its mucous membrane is entirely removed by ulceration for several inches above the anus; and above the ulcerated part it is slightly thickened. The muscular and other coats of the intestine are thicker and denser than is natural, but exhibit no morbid altera- tion of their tissue. xvi. 64 Vide Nos. 2043, 2058, 2060. SIMPLE STRICTURE AND CONTRACTION. 2047. Portion of a Rectum, the cavity of which, at its upper part, is contracted to a quarter of an inch in diameter, without any visible change of structure. The contraction includes about an inch of the length of the intestine: it was probably occasioned by the action of the muscular fibres. xvi. 31 2048. Portion of a Rectum, exhibiting a general thickening and induration of its coats, and a very close annular stricture between two and three inches from the anus. Above the stricture the intestine is dilated, and its muscular coat is thick and strong; below it, there is diffuse superficial ulceration of the mucous membrane. A portion of quill is passed through the contracted part. xvi. 32 2049. A Rectum, exhibiting a contraction of its cavity which commences two inches above the anus, and is thence continued four or five inches upwards. The coats of the intestine are generally thickened and indurated, and the divided edges exhibit white bands intersecting a very firm substance. The cellular and adipose tissue around the rectum is also thickened, and is converted into a hard brawny substance, in which the posterior surfaces of the uterus, vagina, and broad ligaments are involved. xvi. 33 2050. A Rectum, exhibiting a contraction of its canal which commences an inch above the anus and is continued five inches up the intestine. The coats of the intestine are generally thickened, and of very dense texture; the mucous mem- brane in some situations is tuberculated, and in others ulcerated. The cellular and adipose tissue around the intestine is indurated. A portion of the coats of the bladder has undergone the same change of structure as the coats of the rectum. xyi. 47DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 312 ABSCESS AND FISTULA. 2051. Portion of a Rectum, exhibiting a fistula, which extends from the anus upwards between the fibres of the levator ani muscle and the longitudinal muscular fibres of the intestine. A bristle is passed through the fistulous passage, which does not open into the rectum. XYI. 35 2052. Portion of a Rectum, with a Fistula extending for two inches upwards on its exterior, and then suddenly opening into its cavity. The passage is lined by a smootli membrane, like the mucous membrane of the rectum itself. xvi. 50 2053. Portion of a Rectum, with the Anus. Irregular and branched fistulous passages, the course of which is indicated by bristles, extend in various direc- tions around the exterior of the rectum, but none of them open into it. They are lined by soft and smooth membrane. The mucous follicles of the intestine are much enlarged. xvi. 46 2054. A Rectum from a middle-aged woman. Its mucous membrane is com- pletely removed by ulceration, to the extent of several inches above the anus. Abscesses, which formed in the cellular and adipose tissues around the lower part of the intestine, have burst into it by several openings ; and all the adjacent tissues, as well as the coats of the rectum itself, are indurated and consolidated. xvi. 37 2055. A Rectum exhibiting the effects of long-continued inflammation in its coats and in the tissues around them. The whole of the mucous membrane, for about nine inches above the anus, is removed, an irregular shreddy surface being exposed. On this surface there are several apertures which lead to fistulous passages in the diseased tissues. Upon the anterior aspect of the rectum, there is one aperture higher up than the rest, which passes through the walls of the rectum, and which opened directly into the peritoneal cavity. Through this aperture a portion of glass is passed. All the tissues around the rectum are greatly thickened and indurated. xvi. 69 The patient, a middle-aged woman, had long suffered with symptoms of disease of the rectum, when peritonitis was excited hy the formation of the aperture above described, and speedily proved fatal. The first sign of peritonitis occurred during the act of defecation. Vide also Nos. 2058 and 2059. RECTO-VESICAL FISTULA. 2056. Portions of a Rectum and Urinary Bladder, between which a wide com- munication is indicated by a piece of glass. The surface of the rectum, about eight inches from the anus, is extensively and deeply ulcerated; and at one part the ulceration has spread through the thickened and indurated tissue connecting the bladder and rectum so as to form the communication just mentioned. The mucous membrane around the orifice in the bladder is thickened and covered by soft lymph. xvi. 72 From a man, aged 85, who died with asthma. He had not complained of any affection of the rectum or bladder till a week before his death, when he first noticed that air occasionally passed throiigh the urethra. During the last week of his life, both air and f«ces passed with his urine ; the latter chiefly in small masses about as large as peas. Presented by Henry James, Esq. 2057. Portion of a Rectum. Its coats are generally and greatly thickened, indurated, and consolidated with each other, and with the surrounding parts. Just above the anus, there are numerous ulcerated apertures, with smooth edges, which lead through the walls of the rectum into short fistulous canals in the surrounding indurated tissue. One of the canals extends beyond this tissue through the coats of the bladder into its cavity. xvi. 34 Vide Nos, 2071 in this Series, and 2433 Series XXIX.

The Rectum and adjacent portion of the Colon, laid open, • showing syphilitic ulceration of the mucous membrane. The whole mucous membrane of the rectum is destroyed, except one small patch, which is thickened and opaque. The exposed submucous surface is uneven, tuberculated, and thickened by infiltration. On the mucous membrane of the colon, there are ulcers ot regular round or oval shape, from one-sixth to about two-thirds of an inob m diameter, with clean, sharply-cut, scarcely thickened edges, surrounded by healthy, or only too vascular mucous membrane. Their bases are, for the most part, level, flat, or with low granulations resting on submucous tissue nowhere penetrating to the muscular coats, with no marked subjacent thickening or hardeuing. On some of them, are ramifying blood-vessels; on some few there is, at the centre of the base, a small island of mucous membrane. At some places, two or more of these ulcers, extending and uniting, have coalesced into a large ulcer of irregular shape. By such coalescence, some of the ulcers in the lower part of the colon are continuous with the ulcerated surface of the rectum. No ulcers were found in the coecum, nor in the small intestine, except one very small one of rather doubtful character, in the ileum. From a woman, aged 28 years, who had'contracted syphilis seven years previously. The case is reported by Sir J. Paget in the Medical Times and Gazette, March 18th, 1865. The specimen is represented in the drawing, No. 261. 2059. A Rectum affected with syphilis. Towards the upper portion of the bowel, Hie mucous membrane is thrown into large rounded nodules and folds, and the submucous tissue is greatly thickened. From this point to the anus, the inner surface is covered by cicatricial tissue, perforated by very numerous apertures, and the bowel is here contracted. A glass rod is placed in a recto-vaginal fistula immediately above the external sphincter; other fistulas are marked by portions of glass inserted within them. From a woman, aged 27 years, who had had syphilitic disease of the rectum for about eighteen months.—See Stanley Ward Boole, vol. vii, p. 185. 2060. The Rectum of a woman, aged 30 years, affected by what was supposed to be tertiary syphilitic ulceration. 2061.

For history and account of Post Mortem Examination, see Sit well Ward Book, vol. i, p. 103. MORBID GROWTHS. POLYPUS. 2062. Sections of a Polypus of the Rectum. It is an oval flattened mass, about two-thirds of an inch in its greatest diameter, and was attached by a very slender pedicle, nearly an inch long, to the anterior wall of the rectum, just above the margin of the sphincter. It protruded at the anus, covered with high-coloured mucous membrane, that was tinged with blood. Its texture was firm, greyish, very succulent; and it included a few small cavities full of clear yellowish, viscid fluid. In minute structure, it appeared, in every part, composed of disorderly clusters of small tubules, like those of the natural mucous membrane of the rectum. The clusters of glands were partitioned by small quantities of fibro-cellular tissue. XVI. 95 The patient was a boy 4 years old. The growth had been observed for six months. 2063. A large Polypus of the Rectum from a man aged 40 years. Symptoms had existed for ten years, and for two or three years the fasces had never passed without much straining, and occasionally discharge of blood. Before removal,314 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. the polypus could be felt in the rectum nearly four inches from the anus, attached to the posterior wall of the bowel. When protruded by long straining, it appeared as an irregular spheroidal mass, lobed, moderately firm, but brittle, about two and a half inches in its chief diameter, red like the adjacent mucous membrane, readily but not freely bleeding. Its base of attachment seemed to be rather more than an inch in diameter. Under the microscope, the tumour was seen to be composed of small cells like gland cells, and a small quantity of fibro-cellular tissue. Numerous papillae were found, with loops of capillaries in their interior, and covered with cylindrical epithelium. Upon a careful examination a short time after the removal of the tumour, no trace of it could be discovered. Presented by Mr. Thomson. 2064. A Fibro-cellular Polypus, removed from the rectum of a gentleman about 40 years old. Presented by Sir J. Paget. 2065. A Fibrous growth removed from the lower part of the Rectum. It is covered with a structure resembling mucous membrane, which, however, over portions, has the character of common integument, and long silken hairs grow from its surface. The growth is composed of fibrous tissue containing near the pedicle a small portion of bone with a medullary canal. xvi. 124 CANCER OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 2066. A portion of the commencement of the Rectum, showing a sudden con- traction of the intestine, about half an inch long and the size of a quill. The mucous membrane above and below the stricture is slightly thickened. The intestine at the situation of the contraction is bent on itself at an acute angle and bound in that position by adhesions, which pass across the angle. Microscopic examination showed tubules lined by cylindrical epithelial cells contained in a large amount of connective tissue (cylindrical-cell cancer). From a woman aged 37 years.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 14. 2067. Portion of a Rectum and of the Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon. There is an annular constriction at the point of junction of these two portions of the large intestine, and the canal is still further obstructed by the projection of a soft spongy medullary growth into its interior. The rectum itself appears healthy, but the colon is greatly dilated, and its walls much hypertrophied. xvi. 99 The patient, a middle-aged woman, died in the Hospital, after five weeks' suffering from com- plete obstruction of the intestinal canal. The caecum gave way in several places before death, and peritonitis ensued, consequent on the escape of fsecal matter. The case is narrated in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. v, p. 285. 2068. A Rectum, in which distinct masses of soft, spongy, medullary substance have grown from the mucous membrane for about three inches above the anus. Around these masses its coats are thickened and ulcerated. xvi. 42 2069. A Rectum and Urinary Bladder. Soft medullary tumours, arising from the mucous membrane of the rectum in its whole circumference, project into the cavity of the intestine, from the anus for about four inches upwards. The cellular tissue between the bladder and rectum is thickened and indurated. xvi. 56 2070. Portion of a Rectum. At a distance of about three inches from the anus the greater part of the circumference of the intestine is occupied by a firm medullary tumour, growing from beneath its mucous membrane. The mucous membrane is healthy. The tissues around that part of the rectum which is occupied by the morbid structure are thickened and condensed. Some lymphatic315 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. glands behind the rectum are enlarged and filled by a substance similar to that of which the tumour is composed. XVL The patient waa a woman 40 years old. She died extremely emaciated with ^ed^kry tumours in the liver and other parts. She had made no complaint leading to a suspicion ot disease of the rectum. 2071. The lower part of a Rectum, with the Urinary Bladder and an enlarged Prostate Gland. The rectum is the seat of extensive medullary disease. _ boit- enino- and disintegrating, it has made its way into the bladder, involving its mucous lining, and projecting into its interior soft fungous granulations. A free communication exists, as indicated by the director passed from the bladder into the rectum. The prostate is enlarged, chiefly upwards, m its lateral lobes, and the prostatic bar stretches across the neck of the bladder. xvi. 10b The disease was of two years' duration, and proved fatal by exhaustion, consequent upon repeated haemorrhages. Presented by Charles Mayo, Esq. 2072. An annular stricture of the Rectum, situated eight inches from the anus. The mucous membrane at the seat of the stricture is infiltrated with a new growth and ulcerated ; the lower margin of the ulcer is raised and everted. From a woman, aged 56 years, on whom the operation of colotomy was performed on the right side for the relief of intestinal obstruction, caused by the stricture. The patient died from peritonitis on the day following the operation. 2073. A Rectum, with a portion of the sigmoid flexure of the Colon. The rectum presents an annular contraction with thickening, induration, and superficial ulceration of its coats (? cancerous) in the line of its junction with the colon. The contraction of the rectum was so close and firm that a finger could not be passed through it. The colon is dilated and hypertrophied. Except at the annular contraction the rectum is healthy. xvi. 59 Vide No. 2080. HAEMORRHOIDS: Enlargement of the Hsemorrhoidal Veins. 2074.

At its lower border the mucous membrane is raised in folds and lobular tumours, by the hemorrhoidal enlargement of the subjacent veins. XVI- 27 2076. Portion of a Rectum with Haemorrhoids. The surfaces of the haemorrhoids are formed partly by the mucous membrane of the rectum, and partly by the external integuments thickened and raised in irregular folds around the margin of the anus. xvi. 43 2077. A pyriform Clot of Blood, firm and dark, which was removed from a dilated portion of a hsemorrhoidal vein. xvi. 103 INJURIES OF, AND OPERATIONS UPON, THE RECTUM. 2078. Portion of a Rectum from a young person. A quill is passed through an aperture in the upper part of the intestine, where it is covered by peritoneum; the aperture was made by the end of a metallic clyster-pipe. xvi. 36 The contents of the clyster were injected into the peritoneal cavity, and produced fatal peritonitis. 2079. The Rectum, Uterus, and Vagina of a child 5 years old. Ten monthsINJURIES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 316 before the death of the child, in the endeavour to administer an enema, a clyster- pipe was forced through the adjacent walls of the rectum and vagina. At the part thus injured there is a small depression in the wall of the vagina, and a long, pale, and irregular cicatrix in that of the rectum. Near this cicatrix also there are traces of small healed ulcers of the mucous membrane of the rectum. Just below the cicatrix, at a distance of about an inch from the margin of the anus, the canal of the rectum is reduced to an eighth of an inch in diameter, and the adjacent tissues are indurated. Above this stricture the intestine is greatly dilated; below, it is of natural size. A portion of the large intestine is pre- served in No. 1952. xvi. 93 EXCISION OF THE RECTUM. 2080. The lower end of a Rectum, with the anus and a portion of the posterior Avail of the vagina, excised for epithelioma of the rectum, which extended three or four inches up the gut and involved the vagina.

The sac dilates suddenly immediately below the neck, and there is a pouching of its posterior portion which apparently extended upwards behind the neck. From a man who died in the Hospital from renal disease. A month before his death the hernia slipped down, and was reduced only after long and rather forcible application of the taxis under chloroform. The difficulty in reduction was evidently due to the dense fibrous ring around the neck of the sac, and doubtless the hernia tended to pass upwards and backwards into the pouch described.

TWO DISTINCT SACS. 2087. Inguinal Hernia. The sac, which is of large size, is divided into an anterior and posterior portion by a membranous partition, in the upper part of which there are several small apertures ; a quill is passed through one of the larger of them. Except by these apertures, the posterior division of the sac has no communication with the anterior, or with the cavity of the abdomen. xvii. 6 It is probable tbat, that which is now the posterior division of the sac was at one time an ordinary hernial sac, the mouth of which was subsequently closed; that after this had occurred, another sac was protruded in front of the former one ; and that the apertures of communication between them were formed by the gradual thinning and absorption of their adjacent walls. 2088. Inguinal Hernia. There are two distinct hernial sacs side by side, and closely united by their intermediate walls. Each sac has its separate orifice of communication with the abdomen ; but the orifice of one is very small. The spermatic cord is behind both the hernial sacs. xvii. 57 Vide No. 2143.

It is in many parts thickened and indurated. xvii. 59 2094. A large portion of Omentum, which was removed in an operation for strangulated inguinal hernia. Its tissue is generally indurated ; and it exhibits numerous apertures bounded by blood-vessels, which form in some parts a kind of irregular network. XVI- 49 The patient completely recovered. 2095. A large portion of Omentum, partially indurated, which was cut off in an operation for strangulated inguinal hernia. The narrow portion by which it is suspended was attached to a protruded piece of large intestine; the rest was unattached. xvir. 86 The patient, an elderly woman, recovered after the operation, so that it is impossible to say under what circumstances so large a portion of the omentum had become connected with the large intestine alone, and with it by only a narrow pedicle.

The portion of small intestine contained in the sac presents a black and mottled 'appearance, from the intense congestion of its vessels. The small calibre of the intestine below the strangulated part is strongly marked. xvn. 77 2097. A portion of an Ileum, showing a small dark pouch projecting from the intestinal wall, which was adherent to the sac of a femoral hernia. From a man, aged 48 years, on whom herniotomy was performed in the Hospital. The hernia had been strangulated forty-eight hours, and had twice been returned by taxis, again reappearing. The patient died suddenly, forty-eight hours after the operation, apparently from exhaustion. The heart was affected with fatty degeneration. 2098. Strangulated Femoral Hernia, from a male. The contents of the sac are omentum and intestine. The sac is separated from the fascia propria, and opened. The epigastric artery is situated immediately above and to its outer side. xvii. 21 2099.

Portion of Small Intestine from a femoral hernia, exhibiting the effects of strangulation. The intestine has been opened. Near its upper border the impression of the stricture is marked by the thickening and partial ulceration of its coats. The lower portion of the intestine, which was strangulated, is distinguished by its dark colour and pulpy texture. xvii. 44 2102. Portion of a Jejunum, which was strangulated in an umbilical hernia. In the situation of the stricture, the intestine is contracted, and immediately above this is a small round ulcerated aperture, into which a portion of glass is inserted.

Portion of Small Intestine from a femoral hernia. Several openings have been formed in consequence of the sloughing of the part of the intestine whicb was inclosed in the stricture, and around these openings the coats of the intes- tine are very soft and readily separable. xvn. 43 2107. Portion of an Ileum, which was strangulated in an umbilical hernia. In the situation of the stricture the intestine is considerably contracted, and its coats have sloughed and given way in the greater part of its circumference. xvn. 16 2108. A portion of Small Intestine, with an elongated ragged aperture in its wall, where a well-marked constriction exists. From a man, aged 49 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with a strangulated umbilical hernia. During the operation of herniotomy a narrow slough, more than one inch long, escaped from the opening described ; no doubt it consisted of the portions of the mucous and muscular coats corresponding to the line of constriction. 2109. Femoral Hernia, containing a portion of gangrenous intestine. The mortified intestine, of a white colour and with lymph deposited on it, is in the centre of the sac. The upper and lower portions of intestine leading to the strangulated part are laid open; the upper portion is distinguishable by the thickness of its coats and the dilatation of its canal. xxii. 66 2110. Fluid removed from a portion of small intestine which was strangulated, and intensely congested and inflamed in a hernia. The fluid is pale yellowish, pellucid, thin, albuminous, not spontaneously coagulating. With the micro- scope, abundant leucocytes were found in it. This fluid is, probably, an example of what is produced in acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the small intestine. The portion of inflamed intestine being, by the strangula- tion, shut off from communication with the rest of the canal, the fluid produced in it had scarcely any mixture of the ordinary intestinal contents. The quantity of it was so large, that it was necessary to puncture the distended part, in order to reduce the intestine. xvi. 102 Vide Nos. 2092, 2126. TJNTJSTJAIi CONTENTS OF HERNIiE. 2111. Large Inguinal Hernia. A portion of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, dis- placed from its natural situation by the dragging downwards of the peritoneal protrusion, is situated close by the mouth of the sac. From the appearance of the intestine, it is possible that the sigmoid flexure had constituted the contents of the sac. xvn. 32 2112. Femoral Hernia, of unusually large size. The contents of the sac are omentum, with part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon and a portion of small intestine. xvn. 41321 DISPLACEMENTS OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL AND OMENTUM. 2113. Part of the Uterus, with the left Inguinal Canal and other adjacent parts, from a woman on whom an operation was performed for what was supposed to be a strangulated hernia. Below and in front of the inguinal canal, at the upper part of the left labium, a sac, like that of a large tunica vaginalis testis, and having no communication with the abdomen, is laid open. This sac was filled with fluid; and the left ovary and the extremity of the Fallopian tube are fixed to its posterior wall, with portions of the lining membrane of the sac reflected over them. A bristle is passed into the orifice of the Fallopian tube ; the ovary is ill-developed. xvn. 78 The patient was a woman between 30 and 10 years old. A fortnight after her delivery she had peritonitis, and gave such an account of the swelling produced by the sac in her groin, that it was supposed to be a hernia. The operation was performed, and she died three days after- wards. The case may be regarded as one in which the ovary and Fallopian tube passed through the canal of Niick into the labium, and in which the communication between the peritoneal pouch and fche general peritoneal cavity was closed. 2114. The Gall-bladder of a woman, ag-ed 45, admitted into the Hospital with a femoral hernia on the right side. The sac was opened and its contents were returned. She died of peritonitis some clays after. The gall-bladder was found close to the internal abdominal ring, and a decided constriction was visible some little distance above the fundus. A portion of the groove on the inner side was ulcerated. The constriction and ulceration are still visible. The liver did not present the ordinary form; it was elongated from above downwards (see Drawing No. 285) and drawn towards the ring. The post mortem examination afforded no evidence that any portion of intestine or other structure besides the gall-bladder had passed through the femoral ring. xvn. 96 A drawing is preserved, No. 285. 2115. Inguinal Hernia combined with Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis testis. The hernia is situated behind the enlarged tunica vaginalis, which is laid open anteriorly, and is_flattened by the pressure of the hernia. The hernia is opened posteriorly, and its contents, which are the ctecum and part of the colon, are there shown. The vessels of the spermatic cord are separated; the spermatic artery and the vas deferens pass together along the inner and posterior part of the hernia, and the spermatic veins are at some distance external to them. There is no true hernial sac. XVII ^ Vide No. 2086. OCCASIONAL RESULTS OF TAXIS. RUPTURE OF INTESTINE. 2116. Portion of Small Intestine from the sac of a femoral hernia upon which an operation had been performed a few days before death. A considerable openino- was found m the intestine apparently from laceration of its coats, and its edo-es were drawn together by sutures. Lymph is deposited upon the peritoneal surface of the intestine around the opening; and upon the mucous membrane, it is so abundantly deposited that the opening is completely closed by it. xvn. 73 REDUCTION en masse. 2117 Congenital Hernia, for the reduction of which herniotomy was performed On the front of the preparation there is a sac formed by the continuation of the vaginal process of peritoneum into the scrotum. On the abdominal surface a portion of mtestme and the testicle are seen lying in a sac formed by the unobhterated vaginal process, where it passes through the inguinal canal. It is probable that before the operation a part of the hernial sac had been pushed backwards Y822 HERNLE OR PROTRUSIONS, AND OTHER into the abdomen, and that during the operation the intestine was forced into this portion of the sac 2118. Inguinal Hernia, for the reduction of which an operation was performed a short time before death. On one side of the preparation there is a portion of the spermatic cord, and, a little above it, is an opening, which, m the operation, was made into the inguinal canal. On the other side of the preparation is the hernial sac, extending downwards into the pelvis, by the side ot the urinary bladder to which it is attached. In the upper part of the sac, is a circular orifice: this was the mouth of the sac, through which the intestine passed from the cavity of the abdomen. The other and larger opening in the sac was made in the examination of the parts after death. xvn- It is probable that the hernial sac which now appears ^.^^S;' had originally been situated in the scrotum, and that m the ^V^^JwavL of the previous* to the operation, both the sac and its contents had been pushedintoJhj carityof the abdomen. The intestine in the sac was found mortified from the, faghtae s of! the stricture which was formed entirely by the peritoneum at the mouth of the sac ; and it will be observea ^hat by tne placemen/of the sac, its mouth had become situated deep m the abdomen, at a great distance from the internal inguinal ring. 2119. Inguinal Hernia, for the reduction of which the operation was performed. The sac, opened from the front, is thickened and inflamed. Between the peri- toneum and the fascia transversalis, immediately above the mouth of the sac, there is a large space formed by the separation of the cellular tissue m the endeavour to "reduce the hernia. A portion of the intestine, which had been strangulated, was pushed from the hernial sac into this space, and remained mit strangulated.

A Portion of the left side of the Pelvis, showing a part of the ileum, enveloped by omentum, protruded with its peritoneal sac beneath the obturator externus, lying between the muscle and the obturator fascia. The obturator artery and nerve lie immediately above the hernial sac ; the artery being towards its inner, and the nerve towards its outer side. The intestine was closely adherent to its peritoneal sac. . xvn. 90 From a woman, aged 47, who laboured under constipation of three weeks' duration, with its ordinary consequences, amongst which were frequent vomitings of fluid having a strong faecal odour. There existed an omental hernia, protruded beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh, where the omentum had become fixed by adhesions to the peritoneal sac protruded with it. Upon this omental hernia an operation was performed, and the protruded omentum put back into the abdomen. From this period the symptoms abated, but without any action of the bowels having been obtained. Subsequently, however, the symptoms returned with increased severity, and the patient sank three weeks from the commencement of the constipation. The case is related by Mr. Stanley in the Transactions of the Pathological Society of London, vol. iii, p. 94. DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA. 2162. Diaphragmatic Hernia. The preparation exhibits a portion of the left lateral half of the diaphragm, in which there is a large oval opening, presumed to have existed from birth. Through this opening, parts of the arch of the colon, omentum, and pancreas protruded into the thorax. The strangulation of the intestine by the margin of the opening was the cause of death. xvn. 70 The patient, a lad 19 years old, died with complete obstruction of the intestines of three days' duration. Presented by Dr. Norris. 2163. Pericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia of the Omentum. The specimen was taken from the body of a man, aged 50, who was admitted into the Hospital on account of stricture of the urethra. He died apparently from exhaus- tion, the result of pyelitis, ten days after admission. At the post mortem examination, on opening the pericardium, a very remarkable condition presented itself. At the first glance it seemed as if the heart were thickly covered by inflammatory lymph, but a moment's further investigation showed the appear- ance to be due, not to lymph, but to a large piece of the great omentum, about the size of the outstretched hand and fingers, which lay spread out uniformly over the front and sides of the heart, so as almost completely to hide it from view. The omentum is not in the least altered in structure. There were no signs of thickening from inflammation or any other cause, and thereHERNT/E OR PROTRUSIONS, AXD OTHER 328 was no adhesion between it and the surface of the heart, or the parietal pericardium ; neither the surface of the heart nor the inner surface of the parietal pericardium are altered in any way from their normal characters. The omentum has entered the pericardium through an aperture in its floor, which will readily admit the tip of the little finger, and is adherent to the edge of the opening. In the skin over the cardiac region a transverse linear scar, nearly an inch in length, was found, a couple of inches below and about the same distance to the right of the nipple; and corresponding to the position of this scar, the structures occupying the spaces between the fifth and sixth ribs were found thinned and depressed. At the same spot a piece of the cartilage of the fifth rib lay partly separated from its former con- nections. All the parts had, however, long healed; the wound, probably a stab, having been almost certainly inflicted many months or years before death. The hernia was doubtless in consequence of a wound of the floor of the pericardium, inflicted at the same time as the wound in the chest-wall. The past history, however, of the patient is unfortunately a complete blank, as he had no relatives in this country at the time of his death. No other of the thoracic or abdominal viscera besides the urinary, were found diseased. There were, however, indications of old disease of the spine. The heart had been examined during life on more than one occasion, by the House Surgeon, but no abnormal condition was detected. For a fuller report of the case by Mr. Morrant Baker, see Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxviii, 1877. 2163a. Diaphragmatic Hernia, the consequence of a stab through the diaphragm six months before death. Through the aperture in the diaphragm a large portion of the jejunum and ileum, and a part of the arch of the colon, have been protruded. The patient was a man thirty-one years old. He was always healthy until he stabbed himself below the left nipple. The wound was not considered dangerous; but he had subsequently several severe attacks of obstruction of the intestines, the last of which was fatal. INTERNAL STRANGULATION. BY FIBROUS BANDS AND ADHESIONS. 2164. A Portion of the lower part of an Ileum, and the Uterus; the intestine is distended with plaster of Paris. A broad band of adhesion is attached on one side to the fundus of the uterus, and on the other by two diverging bands to two portions of intestine, which if unfolded would be at least one and half inches apart. The adhesion is, therefore, Y-shaped, the two branches being attached to points of the intestine normally at a considerable distance from each other. When the intestine became distended, it resulted that the portion intervening between the two parts of the intestine tied together was bulged out, and a constriction was produced by the pressure and sudden curvature of the intestine against the upper branch of the adhesion. There are numerous adhesions between the uterus, rectum, and ovaries. From a woman, aged 34 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with intestinal obstruction. Five days previously, her bowels were freely open after taking a purgative; the following day she was attacked with severe pain in the abdomen, and vomiting. She survived the obstruc- tion nineteen days, but at no time complained of severe pain or tenderness at any part of the abdomen. About one year and a half before, she was in the Hospital with pelvic cellulitis.— See Elizabeth Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 406 ; and Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 48. 2165. Part of the Small Intestines of a child strangulated by a band of adhesion, which is connected at both its extremities with the mesentery. Bristles are passed behind the band. The whole of the intestine below the constriction is strangulated, and its vessels are greatly congested. The mesenteric glands are enlarged. xvn. 19 The child was 7 vears old. The obstruction had probably existed fourteen days before death.DISPLACEMENTS OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL AND OMENTUM. 329 2166. Inguinal Hernia. A portion of small intestine was found just behind the external inguinal ring strangulated by a band of adhesion extending from the peritoneum near the ring to the mesentery. The testicle is situated within the upper opening of the inguinal canal: it is smaller than natural, and on section presents a granular appearance. The epididymis is not connected with the body of the testicle, but proceeds at once from its upper part, forming a short mass of fine convoluted tube behind the peritoneum, and then becoming gradually larger and less tortuous, assumes the ordinary characters of the vas deferens. XYIL * Both this and Specimen No. 2131, are described by Mr. Lawrence, in his Treatise on Ruptures. London, 1824, 8vo., p. 24-3. BY DIVERTICULA OR FIBROUS BANDS, THE REMAINS OF THE OM- PHALO-MESAEAIC DUCT. 2167. Portion of Small Intestine, from which a Diverticulum is continued. The extremity of the diverticulum is adherent to the contiguous part of the mesentery, so as to form a circular aperture, or ring. Through this aperture a portion of intestine twelve inches long passed and became strangulated. xvii. 53 The patient, a lad subject to constipation, died four days after the commencement of the signs of strangulation of the intestine. Presented by E. P. Pridham, Esq. 2168. A Diverticulum arising from the Ileum at about fifteen inches from its termination in the cascum, and attached at its blind extremity by a ligamentous cord to the umbilicus. The portion of ileum between the origin of this appendage and the caacum had become twisted and entangled about it, causing strangulation, which terminated fatally in thirty-six hours. xvii. 92 From a boy aged 12 years.—See Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal for October, 1830. 2169. A Diverticulum from the Ileum, continued as a fibrous cord, the end of which is attached to a portion of mesentery close to the intestine. A loop of intestine has been rotated on itself, so that the diverticulum and fibrous cord are tightly twisted around it. xvii. 94 2170. Portion of small Intestine, the canal of which is completely constricted by a band of fibrous tissue, passing from the abdominal wall. xvi. 107 2171. The lower portion of an Ileum and the Csecum. A large ragged perfora- tion of the small intestine is seen. The intestine at this point was constricted ; above the constriction it is dilated and its wall thickened ; below it is slightly contracted. Immediately below the perforation, a thin fibrous cord is attached to the free border of the intestine by which the strangulation was produced. Its other attachment was not noted during the operation; but the position and appearance of the cord indicate that it is probably the remains of the omphalo- mesaraic duct. The surface of the intestine in the neighbourhood of the perforation is covered by lymph. From a boy, aged 14 years, who was seized one night with violent pain in the abdomen rigors, and vomiting. He was admitted to the Hospital with symptoms of strangulation' no indication of the cause of which was evident on examination. Laparotomy was per- formed on the seventh day after the onset of the symptoms. The lower portion of the ileum was found constricted by a band, on division of which the perforation was discovered The margins of the perforation were attached to the wound. The patient did not rally from the operation. It was ascertained that he had had a severe attack of abdominal pain with con stipation six months before.—See Mattheto Ward Book, 1879. 2172. Portion of the Ileum showing a constriction just below the attachment of330 HERNI2E OR PROTRUSIONS, AND OTHER the obliterated omphalo-mesaraic duct, by which the intestine had evidently- been strangulated. XVIL 20 2173. Portion of Small Intestine, around which the persistent remains of the omphalo-mesaraic duct has become twisted. The cord appears to be separated into two portions; one of which twice encircles the intestine, and completely strangulates it. The other end of the cord was adherent to the femoral ring. xvn. 79 The patient, a middle-aged woman, had complete obstruction of the bowels for the last seven days of her life. 2174. Portion of Large Intestine strangulated by the pressure upon its walls of a band of fibrous tissue, laden with fat. From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2175. Portion of Small Intestine and of a Csecum from a boy, aged 15 years, who died of ilius. The small intestines are greatly dilated down to within two feet of the ileo-csecal valve, where the bowel is suddenly narrowed so as to form a ring, which will just admit the tip of the little finger. At this obstruction there is no thickening of the peritoneum; the mucous and muscular coats are completely destroyed by ulceration for a breadth of a quarter of an inch at the narrowed part. Immediately below the constriction (between it and the valve) is a diverticulum about four inches long, the tip of which was adherent to the abdominal wall about two inches below the navel. The calibre of the diverti- culum is equal to that of a swan quill—See Post Mortem Book, vol. ii, January 18, 1872. The intestine was probably constricted by the diverticulum. THROUGH APERTURES IN THE MESENTERY OR OMENTUM. 2176. A portion of Mesentery, having in it a circular aperture, through which a portion of small intestine became strangulated. xvn. 99 From a woman, aged 56 years, who, two days after the removal of her breast for cancer, was attacked with diarrhoea, followed by peritonitis and death. 2177. Coils of Small Intestine. One of these having slipped through an aperture in the omentum, the gut was constricted and strangulated by the margins of the opening. In the upper part of the preparation the intestine retains its natural appearance; in the lower it is of a dark, in the recent condition almost black colour, its walls thickened and oedematous, in fact bordering upon a state of gangrene. Over portions of the serous surface lymph has been effused, most abundantly about the seat of stricture. xvn. 93 The man from wbose body these parts were removed was straining violently when be fancied that something gave way within his abdomen. Suddenly, local pain ensued, rapidly becoming intense, then general peritonitis. On the fourth day he was brought to the Hospital. A few hours after his admission he sank and died. APERTURE IN OMENTUM. 2178. Portion of an Omentum, in which, by the adhesion of two adjacent points of its surface, an aperture or ring is formed, through which the finger might be passed. XVL 92 FOREIGN BODIES IN PROTRUDED INTESTINE. 2179. A portion of Small Intestine. Near its free margin are two ragged openings through which a bristle is passed. From a man, aged 45 years, who died under the following circumstances :—A femoral hernia, which, though 'of long standing, had always been reducible, became strangulated. Its reduction was attempted, but unsuccessfully, both by the patient and by the surgeon. He was then brought into the Hospital, where a further moderate attempt was made with the taxis s but this also failed. In the performance of the usual operation and when, after opening the sac,DISPLACEMENTS OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL AND OMENTUM. 331 the gut had been returned, a piece of bone, was discovered behind and external to the Bac. This, on being removed, proved to be part of the rib of a rabbit, lhe patient died of peritonitis. On dissection the two openings in the intestine were observed, and also a perforation of the posterior wall of the sac. It is probable that the bone lodged in the protruded intestine and prevented its reduction.—See St. Bartholomew s Hospital Keporls, vol. iv, p. 261. INTUSSUSCEPTION. OF THE ILEUM INTO THE CffiCUM. 2180. Intussusception of the Small Intestine of a child. The lower portion of the intestine is laid open, and the inverted upper portion is shown ensheathed in it. xvii. 60 2181. Intussusception at three adjacent portions of the Intestinal Canal. 129 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2182. Portion of Ileum inverted into the cavity of the adjoining Caecum. Between the serous layers is a band of mesentery carried down with the portion of inverted ileum, and to its tense condition is due the curved direction of the central canal. The inverted layer of mucous membrane is thickened, especially where it curves round to be continued up the central tube. xvn. 91 2183. Intussusception of a large portion of the Ileum, and of the Appendix Ca ei, within the Caecum and ascending Colon. There is a diverticulum ilei which has passed into the colon with the intussuscepted ileum, but has become inverted, and has passed back again into the ileum, thus producing a double intussusception, of the ileum within the colon and of the diverticulum within the ileum. At the upper part of the preparation is the caecum with the com- mencement of the intussusception and the inverted diverticulum ilei; at the lower part is the whole of the intussuscepted ileum, which was of a dark-brown colour, its vessels being distended with blood. xvii. 61 The patient was a man, 36 years old, who for six months before his death had often suffered pain in the abdomen. He died with peritonitis and obstruction of the intestines. OF THE ILEUM AND CiECUM INTO THE COLON. 2184. Intussusception, in which a considerable portion of the Ileum with the Caecum and its Appendix, have been inverted into the cavity of the ascendin°- colon. xvii. 62 2185. Intussusception from a child. The caecum and a portion of the ileum are inverted and protruded into the colon. Lymph is deposited on the protruded portion of the intestine. XVII. 72 The intussusception was fatal by its obstruction to the passage of the intestinal conteuts. Presented by H. Bateman, Esq. OF THE LARGE INTESTINE. 2186. Intussusception. The caecum and right lumbar portion of the colon are inverted and protruded into the arch of the colon, which is laid open to show the intussuscepted intestine projecting into its cavity. A piece of glass is introduced into the orifice of the intussuscepted intestine, which in some degree retains the dark colour it presented in the recent state. From a child, 2 years old, who died after a few days' illness, in consequence of the obstruc- tion m the ahmentary canal. Presented by William Eadnor, Esq. 2187. Large Intestine of a boy, aged three and a half years. The caecum ascen mg and part of the transverse colon are invaginated into the lower half332 HERNIiE OR PROTRUSIONS, AND OTHER DISPLACEMENTS, ETC. of the large intestine, so that during life two inches and a half of the inverted caecum protruded through the anus. The external aperture is transverse, and situated at the middle of the anterior aspect of the protruded portion, which is formed by the lower end of the ileum, at its junction with the caecum, xvn. 95 The child had suffered for eight months with alternate diarrhoea and constipation. The prolapsus of the bowel was first noticed four months before death. 2188. The Large Intestine of an infant. An intussusception of the upper part of the colon into the sigmoid flexure, and thence into the rectum, had proceeded until the appendix caeci protruded at the anus. The stomach had been drawn, by means of its connection with the transverse colon, into a vertical position. xvii. 87 Presented by Henry Taynton, Esq. SEPARATION OF INTUSSUSCEPTED INTESTINE. 2189. Portion of Small Intestine, nearly three feet long, which was discharged in a gangrenous state from the anus. xvii. 63 2190. The Caecum, and a portion of the Ileum connected with it, from the sa,me person as the preceding specimen. The caecum is opened to show the condition of its mucous membrane, which is extensively ulcerated, and portions of which hang in shreds in the cavity of the intestine. A straw is passed from the caecum through the ileo-caecal valve. The ileum is opened to show the adhesion of its severed extremity to the caecum, and the continuity of their mucous membrane. xvii. 64 The patient was a woman, 48 years old, subject to constipation. Seventeen days before the discharge of the portion of intestine in No. 2189, she was seized with"signs of internal strangula- tion, which continued for six days, and then abated. Subsequent to the discharge of the intestine, which took place eleven days after the partial cessation of the intestinal obstruction, the patient had fsecal evacuations, but she died exhausted ten days after the discharge. There had doubtless been an intussusception of the ileum into the csecum and colon, and the ensheathed portion had sloughed off after it had become adherent at the point of inversion to the portion in which it was ensheathed. Presented by William Radnor, Esq. 2191. A portion of Caecum, with the adjoining parts of the Small Intestine, re- moved from a child whose abdomen was opened during life for intussusception. A large piece of small intestine had passed through the ileo-csecal valve, and it was found impossible to return it, the large intestine having ah-eady sloughed at some points and being rup- tured in the attempt to return the strangulated (intussuscepted) small intestine. The portion of the intestine which forms the specimen was accordingly cut out. The ruptured portion of large intestine was stitched up with fine carbolised cat-gut, and the adjacent cut ends of large and small intestines were similarly sewn together. The patient survived the operation eight hours.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. iv, p. 353. INTUSSUSCEPTION IN ANIMALS. 2192. Intussusception of the Intestine of a Dog.SERIES XXI. —♦— DISEASES AND INJTJEIES OF THE LIVEE. THICKENING OF THE SEROUS LINING. 2193. Portion of a Liver enveloped by a thick layer of substance resembling fibro-cartilage, which is but slightly adherent to its surface, and probably consists of the thickened and indurated peritoneal coat. The surface of the liver, exposed by the reflection of a portion of the layer, appears healthy and smoothly covered by its fibrous coat. xviii. o FATTY DEGENERATION. 2193a. A Section of a Liver affected with Fatty Degeneration. It is pale, smooth, and mottled of a yellowish white colour, owing to the infiltration of the cells at the periphery of the lobules with fat. Vide No. 3220, Series L. AMYLOID DEGENERATION. 2194. Section of a Liver which has undergone amyloid, lardaceous, or waxy change. The organ was greatly increased in size and weight. Its tissue was firm, compact, and waxy-looking. xviii. 35 ABSCESS. 2195. Portion of a Liver, in which a large circumscribed Abscess, situated near its convex surface, opened by an irregular orifice through the diaphragm and the adjacent portion of the adherent lung into one of the bronchial tubes. The surfaces of both the lung and the liver are covered by thick tough layers of false membrane. xviii. 34 Presented by Dr. Hue. 2196. Portion of a Liver containing a large abscess with ragged walls, surrounded by condensed hepatic tissue. 151 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2197. Portion of a Liver, containing an abscess situated beneath the peritoneal surface of the organ. The adjacent layers of serous membrane are adherent, and its sac is obliterated over the abscess. 152 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. Vide Series L, Nos. 3230 and 3231. CIRRHOSIS. 2198. Section of a Liver, the whole substance of which is indurated and pale from increase of the interlobular connective tissue. Its external surface is tuberculated and nodular, and a similar nodular appearance is shown on the surface of its section. It is an example of what is termed Cirrhosis, or Hobnailed Liver. xviii. 15 2199. Section of a Liver, presenting the characters of cirrhosis in a less degree than in the preceding specimen. xviii. 20 2200.

A cast of it is preserved, No. 138. 2201. Section of a Liver, exhibiting an advanced stage of cirrhosis, or " hobnailed liver." Its surfaces present the peculiar nodular tuberculated appearance characteristic of this disease. xvm. 36 2202. A specimen of cirrhosis of the Liver. 144 From a sailor (Lascar.) From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. « NUTMEG " LIVER. 2203. Section of a " Nutmeg" Liver. A change produced by mechanical con- gestion. The mottled appearance is produced by the dark red colour of the centre of the lobules, due to atrophy and disintegration of hepatic cells with deposition of pigment granules, whilst the peripheral portions are of a yellowish white colour. From a case of mitral disease with pulmonary congestion and dilated right heart. DILATATION OF THE HEPATIC DUCTS. 2204. Part of a Liver, showing the Hepatic Ducts greatly enlarged, their canals being variously dilated and sacculated; and the surrounding tissue condensed. The ducts were engorged with bile, and the hepatic lobules were of a deep green colour from the retention of their secretion, which was due to the presence of a large mass of medullary cancer pressing upon, and occluding the common duct, just before it entered the duodenum. xviii. 40 For the history of the case see St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xvii, p. 209. THROMBOSIS OF THE PORTAL VEIN. 2205. The Liver from a man aged 57 years. It is highly cirrhosed. The vena porta is completely obstructed by a granular, friable, softish coagulum, adherent to the lining membrane of the vein; no doubt formed some time (probably weeks) before death. The thrombus entered but a very little way into any of the vessels of which the vena portee is composed, but passed deeply into the smaller branches of the hepatic vein, entering the right lobe, and much less into the branches of the left lobe. The spleen was large and soft: the stomach and intestines were full of altered blood : there was great ascites and jaundice.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. hi, case 55. 2206. A Section through the right lobe of a Liver, which is affected with sup- purative pyle-phlebitis. The portal vein at its entrance into the liver is thickened, especially the inner coat, which is stained and covered at one point by a patch of adherent lymph. The vein was filled with an ichorous purulent thrombus, as far as its first and second divisions. The parenchyma of the liver generally is soft and pulpy; in patches, chiefly distributed over the anterior surface and lower part of the organ, it is infiltrated with pus, and broken down. The infiltration, which is of a dirty yellow colour, is limited to a small area around thrombosed branches of the portal vein, as may be observed both in transverse and longitudinal sections of the veins. By the agglomeration of these areas, large patches of broken-down parenchyma are formed. From a man, aged 31 years, who was suddenly seized with pain in the right hypochondrium and vomiting. He had repeated rigors with sweatings and irregular rises of temperature. A fortnight later he became deeply jaundiced. There was extreme tenderness over, and pain in, the right hypochondrium. The rigors and fever continued, and he died about four weeks after the onset of hepatic symptoms. Post Mortem :—A circumscribed collection of pus was found around the attachment of the vermiform appendix. A thrombus extended from this along a mesenteric vein to the portal vein. There was apparently no impaction in, or ulceration of, the vermiform appendix.—See Luke Ward Book, vol. ix, p. 246. ECCHYMOSIS IN PYEMIA, &c. 2207. A Portion of the thin margin of a Liver, showing several small dots andDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE LIVER. patches of ecohymosis beneath the peritoneum, and in the superficial portion of the liver substance. They appeared to be in places certainly extravasations, m others only engorged vessels. The liver was pale and friable. There were ecchymoses on the surface of the heart, and the pericardium contained blood- stained fluid, but there were no ecchymoses in the lungs or pleuree. , From a man who died five days after amputation of the thigh for disease ot the nglit Knee- joint. The parts divided in the amputation were undermined by old suppurating sinuses, and the long saphena vein was full of dark clots. Before death the opposite limb became cedematous, and the superficial veins hard and cord-like. On post mortem examination an old broken-down clot was found at the junction of the femoral and profunda veins m the left side. OBLITERATION OF THE PORTAL VEIN. 2208. Portion of the Liver of a woman aged 48 years. Tn the hilus the gall-ducts, hepatic artery, and a great number of small tortuous veins are seen. The portal veins could nowhere be found until, on dissecting deeply in the portal fissure, two tough, narrow fibrous bands were discovered, one running right and the other left, and uniting in what was probably the remains of the portal vein. In the middle of each fibrous band there was a minute channel, ending at the liver. On tracing the branches of the portal vein within the liver towards the portal fissure, they are completely lost just at the fissure, and close to the fibrous bands described above. The hepatic veins, gall-bladder, and ducts were natural. The liver was pale, but natural. No splenic vein could be found. The hilus of the spleen was full of small varicose veins, forming a plexus, which seemed to lead, in chief part, into the coronary veins. The splenic artery was very large, tortuous, and its walls were very much thicker than natural. The spleen was very large, pale, and tough. The patient had been subject to attacks of hsematemesis for twenty years, and she died at last after a severe attack. The hsematemesis was usually preceded for some days by a sense of weight in the splenic region. The stomach is contained in Series XVII, No. 1905.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. hi, Case 160. MORBID GROWTHS, &c. MELANOTIC TUMOURS. 2209. A vertical section through the right lobe of a Liver, infiltrated with mela- notic sarcoma. The liver weighed 21 lb. 8 oz. The lower part of the section is pale, yellow, and flabby. This more natural-looking part is most sharply marked off from the part above, which is firm, of a greenish black colour, with spots of brown. The growth was secondary to a melanotic sarcoma of the eyeball, for which the globe was excised eighteen months before death, and which had not recurred locally. Secondary growths were found in the other organs of the thorax, abdomen, and in the breasts. See account of case by Dr. Wickham Legg, Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxix, p. 225. There is a drawing of the specimen, No. 277. 2210. Section of a Liver, in which there are several medullary tumours, variously streaked and spotted with melanotic matter. xviii. 27 2211.

Cancer of the Liver from an infant 5 months old, probably of very rapid growth, as the child was healthy and cheerful until one month before its death. The liver weighed 40^ oz. The lymphatic glands in the hilus were not affected. All the lobes are shredded with round masses of new growth, white, tough, and of all sizes, from the smallest possible to that of a walnut. Viewed under the microscope the morbid growth appeared to consist of a dense fibrillated stroma, with small meshes packed full of small cells, the latter being tolerably uniform in character, about twice the diameter of a red blood corpuscle, oval, containing several glistening particles in the interior, but not distinct nuclei. No cancer was found in any other part of the body. The case is narrated in the St. Bartholomew"s Hospital Reports, vol. vii, 1871. Presented by Anthony A. Henley, Esq. 2217.

Portion of a Duodenum, with a large Hydatid, rolled up, and impacted in the common bile-dnct, which it dilates, and from which a portion of it protrudes into the intestine. XIX- The patient was a boy 14 years old. Three months before death he had signs of acute in- flammation of the liver, and'six days before death had acute pain in the right hypochondrium, followed by jaundice. He was relieved for a time, but the pain recurred with greater severity, and he died delirious. There was a great cyst full of hydatids in the right lobe of the liver.

For the last nine days of her life she had copious haemorrhage from the gums nose, and intes- tines and in the last two days discharged from the latter scarcely anything but blood. She died comatose. The case is recorded by Dr. Ormerod, in the Lancet, 1846. By pressure from without. 2255. A Gall-Bladder and Ducts, with the adjacent Lymphatic Glands. The coats of the gall-bladder are much thickened, especially around its neck; and their section displays a dense, greyish, semi-transparent substance, like hard cancer. At the ductus cysticus the thickening has taken place to such an extent as to obliterate the canal. At this part, also, and around the neck of the gall-bladder, the lining membrane is thickened, rough, and tuberculated. At the base of' the gall-bladder there is a small circular growth, composed of numerous close-set little processes upon narrow pedicles. The lymphatic glands around the biliary ducts are much enlarged and indurated, and had the appearance of glands affected by carcinomatous disease. xix. 3 From a woman, between 30 and 40 years old, who had also carcinomatous disease of the ovaries, kidneys, and lumbar lymphatic glands. 2256.

Portion of a Liver, with the Gail-Bladder, Biliary Ducts, and part of the Duodenum. The gall-bladder is thickened and contracted. A passage is formed by ulceration from the gall-bladder into the duodenum, through which passage a large calculus passed into the intestine. All the biliary ducts are much dilated. A rod of glass is passed from the common duct into the dtiodenum; but the communication of the cystic duct with the gall-bladder is obliterated. xix. 11 2262. Portion of a Liver with the Gall-Bladder, which is adherent by dense con- nective tissue to the liver, pylorus, and first part of the duodenum. The gall- bladder, whicb contains numerous faceted gall-stones, communicates with the duodenum just beyond the pylorus by two openings, whicb were occupied by gall-stones; one opening as large as a three-penny piece has been cut across, in the other a piece of glass is placed. The wall of the gall-bladder is much thickened and indurated. The cystic duct was obliterated : but bile flowed from the common duct, when it was cut across. The structure of the liver is normal.

The duodenum was compressed and partially surrounded by it, and its walls were infiltrated with the new growth. A glass rod is placed in the common bile-duct, which is stained with bile : the cystic duct was obliterated. The stomach was enormously dilated, covering nearly the whole abdomen. Secondary deposits were found in the peritoneum, pleura, and surfaces of the lungs ; the abdominal organs were not involved in the disease. The specimen was taken from a woman aged 59 years. She had noticed an increasing swelling of her stomach for five years, but it had given her no inconvenience until about a month before her admission to the Hospital. A hard tumour was felt in the region of the liver. The patient was not jaundiced. Vomiting subsequently set in, and she died of cachexia and exhaustion.—See Hope Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 362 j Post Mortem Book, vol. vn, p. 137; and Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxxi, 1880. 2265.

CALCULI IN THE DUCTS, &c. 2270. A Pancreas. The much dilated duct, which is laid open, contains very numerous rough spiculated concretions of various shapes and sizes. Its rami- fications are filled by similar small concretions, as shown by sections at various parts of the gland. A bristle is passed through the opening into the intestine; immediately before entering the intestinal wall the greatest dilatation of the duct is observed. The concretions consisted of carbonate of lime. From a man, aged 40 years, who died of diabetes.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 87. 2271. A Pancreas, with the vertical portion of the Duodenum. The pancreatic duct near its greater end is dilated into a spherical sac of more than an inch in diameter. A portion of glass is passed from this sac through the rest of the duct (which was obstructed by calcareous matter), into the duodenum. The pancreas itself is diminished in size and less lobulated than natural. Its substance is hard and nearly homogeneous. XX. 2 Tbe patient was a very intemperate man 48 years old. He had long suffered with dyspepsia, diarrhoea, and intestinal discharges of an oily fluid which, on cooling, congealed into a substance like spermaceti.

XXII. 6 LYMPHADENOMA. 2305. Half of an enlarged Spleen affected with lymphadenoma. The section is marbled by patches of soft whitish lymphoid tissue, intermingled with the red splenic substance. The lumbar and mesenteric glands, which alone were affected, formed a mass connected with the spleen. From a man, aged 41 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with a large tumour in the left hypochondrium and ascites. He had enjoyed good health until a year before. Death took place from exhaustion.—See John Ward Booh, January, 1879; Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 104. ENTOZOA IN THE SPLEEN. 2306. A large Cyst in the Spleen, projecting from the superior surface and con- taining numerous hydatids. There were also hydatids in the liver of the same person.

On the outer surface a large oblong blood-clot is seen beneath the capsule, and lying in a depression upon the parenchyma of the organ. The specimen was taken from a man who had received an injury to the abdomen. 2308. The Spleen of a child, deeply and extensively lacerated by a blow on the abdomen. XXII gSERIES XXVI. —♦— DISEASES OF THE THYMUS AND THYROID GLANDS. 2309. The Thymus Gland of a child, enlarged and very firm, but of apparently healthy texture. xxn. 8 The child was 12 months old, and had well-marked thymic asthma. It died in convulsions. The heart was enlarged, and the vessels of the brain much congested. The thymus gland weighed 328| grains; and measures three inches and three quarters in length. Presented by Dr. "West. ENLARGEMENT OF THE THYROID GLAND (BRONCHOCELE, ADENOMA, AND CYSTO-ADENOMA). 2310. A Thyroid Gland, greatly and almost uniformly enlarged in all parts, but presenting no apparent morbid change of texture. A bristle is passed beneath two strong muscles (Levatores glandules thyroideee) which extend from the body of the os hyoides downwards, to the inner part of each lateral lobe of the gland, and are attached to its surface. The superior thyroid arteries are of their ordinary size, the inferior thyroid arteries are enlarged; each of them is nearly equal in size to an external carotid. The trachea is compressed and flattened by the pressure of the lateral lobes of the enlarged gland. xxn. 14 The opening in the larynx between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages was made in the hope of relieving the dyspcena under which the patient, a boy about 14 years old, laboured. But it was unayauing ; and he died suffocated. 2311. Sections of a Thyroid Gland uniformly enlarged in all its parts, so as to form a simple bronchocele. The texture of the gland appears healthy, except in that it is coarser than that of glands of ordinary size, and that cysts of one or two lines in diameter and filled with viscid fluid are irregularly scattered in it. The enlarged gland completely surrounds, and has somewhat compressed the trachea and the lower part of the larynx. xxn. 10 2312. Section of a Thyroid Gland, enlarged like the preceding, but presenting more numerous cysts with viscid fluid, which cysts also appear in many instances partitioned. Its blood-vessels are minutely injected. xxn. 11 2313. The Thyroid Gland of an old man. Its right lobe is much enlarged, and exhibits in its interior several large cysts, which contained a serous fluid. The walls of these cysts are formed by tough fibrous tissue, in which are several plates of earthy matter, like plates of bone; their interior is smooth and polished. The proper tissue of the gland is expanded around the cysts. XXIL 15 2314. A Larynx, Pharynx, and adjacent parts, with the Thyroid Gland. The rio-ht lobe of the gland is enlarged by the formation of a cyst of more than four inches diameter in its interior. The walls of this cyst appear to be351 DISEASES OP THE THYMUS AND THYROID GLANDS. formed by the distended tissue of the gland ; its interior is rough, and has a large quantity of lymph deposited upon it, some of which hangs in it m loose shreds. At its upper part, the cavity of the cyst communicates with that of the pharynx by a narrow ulcerated aperture (indicated by a piece of glass) near the arytenoid cartilae-e. The isthmus and left lobe of the gland are healthy. J xxn. 1G The patient was an elderly woman, and the enlargement of the gland had long existed. The oyst at first contained a fluid-like serum, which, when withdrawn, spontaneously coagulated. After being twice emptied, the walls of the cyst inflamed, audit was rapidly filled with pus and lymph.; its wall ulcerated, and the ulceration extending through the adjacent part of the pharynx, the patient was suffocated by the sudden discharge of its contents, and the passage of some of them into the larynx. ENLARGEMENT WITH DEPOSITS OF CALCAREOUS MATTER. 2315. A Thyroid Gland, of which one of the lobes is enlarged to three or four times its natural size. Portions of the large lobe are indurated ; and in these portions are many deposits of earthy matter. The other lobe and the isthmus of the gland are rather smaller than is natural. xxn. 13 2316. A Larynx and Trachea dried, with large round masses of earthy matter which were contained in a diseased thyroid gland. xxn. 9 2317. Portions of earthy matter, in the form of cysts, from a bronchocele. xxn.12 Vide No. 2313. MORBID GROWTHS. 2318. A New-Growth in the Thyroid Gland, from a man aged 43 years. The supra-renal capsules and numerous lymphatic glands, principally the deep cervical, mesenteric, and lumbar, were similarly affected. There were also large masses of new-growth in the liver, which weighed 10 lbs. 12 ozs., in the pancreas, and in the kidneys. Upwards of one hundred small nodules were found in the integument on the anterior surface of the trunk. 2319. A New-Growth in the Thyroid Gland, from a man aged 48 years. Symptoms of pressure on the trachea existed for ten months before death, which occurred suddenly.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. i, p. 239, and Pathological Society's Transaction, vol. xx, p. 393.SEEIES XXVII. —♦— DISEASES OF THE SUPRA-RENAL BODIES. AMYLOID DEGENERATION. 2320. Supra-renal Capsule, from a man aged 36 years. The cortical substance is in a state of amyloid degeneration. The medullary structure is not affected. The other capsule was in a similar condition. xxn. 23 He died from phthisis and albuminuria, with amyloid degeneration of the liver and kidneys. But the capsules were most effected. There was no change of colour of the skin. TTTBERCTTDAR DISEASE (with Caseous and Calcareous Degeneration). 2321. Two Supra-renal Capsules, from a man aged 20 years. The lower one has been laid open. The substance of both is destroyed by tubercular disease. Tubercle was also found in the lungs and mesenteric glands. There was general but not deep bronzing of the skin. The man had been delicate all his life, but had become much weaker during the last year of it. xxn. 26 2322. The right Supra-renal Capsule, from a man aged 34 years, It is some- what increased in size, and the tisue is nearly wholly replaced by masses of cheesy matter, some very soft; besides these cheesy masses, there is a little translucent greyish material. The right semilunar ganglion was dissected out and found natural: there was no matting together of the parts around. The left supra-renal capsule was diseased in precisely the same manner as the right. The face, neck, nipples, scrotum, and penis were rather deeply tinted of a sooty colour; there were many small black spots on the face, but no pigmentation within the mouth. There were numerous cheesy masses at the apices of both lungs. The liver and spleen were adherent to all the parts around by old ad- hesions. The right supra-renal capsule was densely adherent to the liver.— See Post Mortem Book, vol iii, Case 43. xxn. 31 2323. A left Supra-renal Capsule, seen from behind, with the aorta, the semi- lunar o-ano-lion, supra-renal and renal plexuses. The great splanchnic nerve is seen coming down from above to the semilunar ganglion, and sending down a branch which passes behind the supra-renal artery, to the renal plexus below. Near it and to the right, a branch of the.pneumogastric comes down and joins the ganglion. The supra-renal artery springs from the renal, which has been cut off Ishort. The vein, with the renal vein, has been cut off to show the nerves. The outer surface of the capsule is rough and irregularly nodulated; one laro-e nodule being especially prominent at the exact point where the nerves enter the organ. The peculiar features of the disease are well seen in the other half of the capsule, the cut surface of which is shown below. A fibrous band, continuous with the thickened fibrous investment, passes obliquely across the organ, dividing it into two unequal parts. No trace of the natural structure remains, but the whole organ is much enlarged and converted into a moderatelyDISEASES OF THE SUPRA-RENAL BODIES. 353 firm substance, in parts whitish, in parts of a dirty-brown colour, dotted here and there with small spots and streaks which are now white, but in the recent state had a tint of yellow. The capsule and all the surrounding nerves are imbedded in an unusually large amount of fibi-ous tissue, which matted together the plexuses. This fibrous thickening extended up the splanchnic and pneumo- gastric nerves, and became continuous with firm old adhesions, which surrounded the liver and spleen and bound the upper half of the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall. The right capsule was not quite so large, but in other respects similar to the left. From a woman, aged 31 years, who died under Dr. Tuckwell's care in the Radcliffe In- firmary, Oxford, with well-marked, general, and local symptoms of Addison's disease of the supra-renal capsules.—See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. vii. Dissected and presented by Dr. Tuckwell. 2324. Portions of the two Supra-renal Capsules of a man who died with exten- sive tubercular disease. They are laden with a pale, yellowish deposit, diffused equally through their entire substance. In one this deposit has in places dried u p and become calcified. The capsules were considerably enlarged. The skin retained a natural appearance. xxn. 21 For the history of this case, see St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xvi, p. 209. 2325.

Section of a Kidney, enlarged and appearing very pale and soft in every part, except those in which there are large blotches of effused blood, lhe principal branches of the renal vein are filled by firm dry coagula. xxvi. 25 The patient, a lad, about 19 years old, died with acute dropsy and albuminous urine, which supervened on intemperance and exposure to cold a few weeks before his death. CHRONIC PARENCHYMATOUS NEPHRITIS (LARGE WHITE KIDNEY). 2333 Section of a Kidney, enlarged, and the cortical substance of which is pale A fine injection of size and vermilion through the renal artery shows that the whole organ, and especially the altered cortical substance, possesses less vascularity than is natural. The capsule of the kidney was stripped off more readily than usual, and the whole organ is large and soft. The other kidney was similarly altered.

A specimen in which there is abundant tubercular deposit on the mucous membrane of the pelvis, and in the cavities of the dilated infundibula. xxvi. 7 2340. A Kidney, in which there are many large cavities formed in consequence of abundant tubercular deposits in its substance. The cavities are lined by Li vers of false membrane coated by tubercular matter. The ureter is thickened, and tubercular matter covers its internal surface. xxvi. 27 There were tubercles in the lungs and several other organs, including the prostate gland and vesiculse seminales, preserved in Series XXXIX, No. 2847. 2341. A Kidney, and the upper portion of its Ureter, both filled with tubercular matter. Removed from a boy, aged 17. There was a large deposit of tubercle in the prostate about the neck of the bladder, which, bursting into it, caused retention of urine. 2342. Sections of a Kidney, which, with its pelvis, is occupied by abscess cavities of irregular shape, their walls nodulated, and formed by exteu- sive tubercular deposits. The abscesses approach the surface, and one in the lower section seems to have passed beyond and opens through the capsule. A small trace only remains of the original tissue, a little pale cortical substance being the only indication of it. Abundant lime salts are deposited upon the tuberculated and eroded surfaces.

In the ureter, where it crossed the brim of the pelvis, is an impacted calculus, the size ot a horse-bean. The pelvis of the kidney is distended, and contains about twenty stones, three of which are large and faceted. They are probably composed of uric acid coated with phosphates. The pelvis also contained pus and the abscess communicated by a fistulous passage passing through the eft wing ot the diaphragm near the ribs, with a left empyema. The right kidney was laro-e, but otherwise natural.—See Post Mortem Booh, vol. vm, p. 25. 2349. The Kidneys of the patient from whom the large calculi preserved in Series LII were taken. Both organs are converted into cyst-like sacs, the secreting structures being almost entirely destroyed. 2350.

A Kidney, in the pelvis of which are large and irregular calculi The inflammation and suppuration resulting from the presence of the calculi were followed by adhesion of the kidney to the adjacent portion of the descending colon, and the discharge of the contents of its pelvis into the intestinal^canal through an ulcer. 2352. Kidneys from a woman, aged 52 years. The left kidney is very small. The ureter is natural throughout. The right kidney is enlarged, its pelvis is greatly dilated, and was tilled with ropy pus; it also contained four small loose calculi. The kidney structure is atrophied in places. The ureter is thickened. —See Post Mortem Book, vol. iii, p. 29. 2353 A Kidney which has undergone complete fatty degeneration.

A Kidney, exhibiting the obstruction of the commencement of the ureter357 THEIR PELVES, AND THE URETERS. by a large calculus, and the consequent dilatation of the pelvis and infundibula, and absorption of its glandular substance. , xxvi. lb' 2355. A Kidney, which is much enlarged in consequence of the lodgment of a calculus at the commencement of the ureter. The infundibula are dilated, their mucous lining and the proper substance of the organ are indurated, and appear to be the seat of a purulent deposit. Portions of glass are introduced through two ulcerated apertures leading directly from the kidney to the descending colon. The portion of the colon which thus communicates with the interior of the kidney, exhibits numerous small ulcers of its mucous membrane. The capsule of the kidney, a part of which is reflected, is thickened, indurated, and consolidated with the surrounding tissues. xxvi. 5 The patient was a young man who Had suffered from attacks of pain in the loins, which were always relieved by discharge of pus from the rectum. A quantity of pus was found also to have passed from the lower part of the kidney to the back of the psoas muscle. 2356. A Kidney, with a large calculus obstructing the commencement of the ureter. Immediately below the obstruction, the ureter is completely obliterated: above it, the whole kidney is dilated into one large sac; its glandular substance appearing in some parts as a thin layer spread over the surface of the dilated infundibula. xxvi. 24 From a lady, 7-1 years old, who had been subject for thirty-two years to attacks of renal disease, w hich were complicated towards the end of life by cancer of the intestines and other parts. The dilated kidney was adherent to the front of the abdomen, and had long been felt as a painful deep-seated tumour. Presented by Thomas Davis, Esq. 2357. A large Sac caused by dilatation of the pelvis of a kidney, in consequence of the impaction of a calculus in the ureter. It formed a movable abdominal tumour, the nature of which was doubtful during life. xxvi. 38 2358. A Kidney, with a large calculus impacted in the commencement of the ureter. The kidney is much increased in size, and its substance appears indurated, and in parts, infiltrated with pus. The pelvis and infundibula are greatly dilated, and their mucous membrane is thickened, and made rough by the copious deposit of lymph and pus, or of tubercular matter, upon its surface. xxvi. 9 2359. A Kidney, having a large calculus impacted at the commencement of the ureter. The pelvis and the calices are dilated, and the excretory structure of the organ is destroyed. In the dilated pelvis was a quantity of purulent fluid. Perforating the tissues which intervened, this pus had made its way to the surface, and discharged in the loins by means of the sinus seen in the prepara- tion. The other kidney presented a natural appearance. xxvi. 34 2360. Left Kidney of a man, aged 26 years. In the ureter, about three inches from the kidney, a dark-coloured conical-shaped calculus is impacted and adherent to the inner surface of the canal. The ureter above the stone was full of pus, as was also the thickened and dilated pelvis of the kidney. The parenchyma of the organ is atrophied, but its interstitial tissue and capsule are obviously much thickened. The right kidney was greatly enlarged, the capsule rather adherent, and the cortex greatly swollen. The texture was confused, translucent, with a little opacity here and there. The pyramids were pale, feathered out, and indistinct at the bases. The bladder was natural The left ventricle of the heart was hypertrophied. Small ulcers were present m the mucous membrane of the stomach and duodenum.—Post Mortem Book vol. iii, p. 3.

Obliteration or Obstruction of Ureter. 2361. A Kidney, reduced to about one-fourth of its natural size, by absorption of its glandular substance. The ureter is obliterated at its commencement: the pelvis is as large as usual. The other kidney of the same patient was healthy in structure, but of nearly twice the natural size. xxvi. 10 2362. A Kidney, of which the ureter is so contracted at its commencement, that it will only admit the passage of a bristle. The pelvis and infundibula are considerably enlarged, and there is an almost complete absorption of the paren- chyma of the kidney. xxvi. 4 2363. A Bladder, with the Ureters and one Kidney, of a boy about 10 years old. The muscular coat of the bladder is hypertrophied, and its mucous mem- brane is thickened, indurated, and very deeply wrinkled. Just before their terminations in the bladder, both ureters are so contracted that they would only admit the passage of a probe. Above these contractions they are both, in the rest of their extent, widely dilated. The pelvis and infundibula of the kidney are also dilated, and its glandular substance is partially absorbed. xxvn. 8 Presented by S. Q-. Lawrance, Esq. 2364. The Kidneys from a girl, aged 14 years. The left kidney shows an advanced condition of hydro-nephrosis ; the pelvis is distended and the parenchyma of the organ is destroyed, with the exception of a few flattened disc-like portions. The pelvis of the right kidney is also dilated, but the parenchyma appears increased in quantity and is swollen, pale, and opaque. The right ureter is dilated to the size of a quill, the left ureter is not dilated. On passing a probe along the ureters in either direction, it was evident that there was a decided constriction at a point half an inch distant from the bladder; the constriction was more marked in the left than in the right canal. When laid open, the right ureter presented nothing definite at the point noted, but in the left ureter the constric- tion was marked by a very narrow whitish line. The bladder and urethra were quite natural. The liquid taken from the kidneys was of a pale brown colour, sp. gr. 1012, with a faint trace of albumen and flocculent sediment—no doubt dilute urine.—See Post Mortem Booh, vol. iii, p. 358. 2365. The Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder from a woman, aged 43 years, who died from suppression of urine. The kidneys are in a state of commencing suppuration. Three inches below the kidney the right ureter is greatly thick- ened, and its calibre narrowed, but not obstructed. A short distance lower, the walls of the ureter again become thickened and continue so until its entrance into the bladder. The left ureter is affected in a similar manner. The bladder is hypertrophied. 2366. A Kidney, elongated in form, with dilatation of the pelvis and some thin- ning of the parenchyma. The ureter is irregularly dilated and opens into the bladder by a pin-hole aperture, through which a probe could be passed when the ureter was straightened out, but not otherwise. From a child, aged 8 months. The other kidney was normal. The dilatation of the pelvis and ureter, and the atrophy of the kidney substance, were probably due to obstruction to the passage of urine into the bladder. From a rickety child.—See Post Mortem Booh, vol. viii, p. 41. 2367. The Bladder and a portion of the Ureters, from an old case of stricture of the urethra, with a history of two years' duration. The specimen shows theTHEIR PELVES, AND THE URETERS. 359 ordinary effects of urinary obstruction, as well as an unusual prolapsed condi- tion of'the vesical end of both ureters into the bladder, with extreme hyper- trophy and dilatation of the tubes themselves. Their vesical orifices are reduced to pin-hole apertures. The prolapsed pouch of the right ureter con- tains a calculus. On the posterior wall of the bladder a sacculus of mucous membrane is thrust out betsveen the muscular fibres. The prolapsus of the ureters seems to bo due to the disproportion of size between the ureters themselves and their vesical orifices, as if, in the efforts to micturate, the urine, being unable to escape freely from the bladder and distended ureters, the abdominal walls had compressed and borne down the ureters themselves. The specimen is described in the Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xii, 1863. b. Obstruction to the flow of Urine from the Bladder. 2368. The Urinary Organs, showing the effects of stricture. There is a firm, fibrous stricture in the membranous portion of the urethra. The bladder is slightly dilated and its walls much thickened. The ureters are largely and irregularly dilated. The pelvis and calices of the kidneys are dilated and the parenchyma of the organs is atrophied. These changes are much more advanced in the left kidney. There are two ureters on the left side, one of which com- municates with the upper, the other with the lower half of the pelvis of the kidney, each conducting away the urine from corresponding portions of the organ. They unite at their vesical extremities to form a single duct. From a boy, aged 15 years, who had long suffered from symptoms of stricture, due to an injury eight years before admission to the Hospital. Death took place from suppurative nephritis and acute cystitis.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 167. 2369. Right Kidney, showing dilatation of the pelvis and ureter. The kidney is atrophied, indurated from increase of its interstitial tissue, and it contains cysts. From a man who died in Matthew Ward, May, 1869. He hid long suffered from enlarged prostate and difficulty in micturition. Death took place from extravasation of urine. Several false passages were found at the vesical orifice of the urethra. 2370. The Bladder, Ureters, and Kidneys of a boy, 13 years old. The bladder is contracted, its muscular coat hypertrophied, and its mucous coat ulcerated. The ureters are very tortuous, widely dilated, and thickened. The mucous membrane of each is rough, and lymph and pus are in some parts deposited upon it. The pelves and infundibula of both kidneys are also widely dilated, thick- ened and rough on their internal surfaces from similar deposit. The kidneys appear enlarged by the dilatation of their pelves and infundibula, but their glandular substance is thinned. xxvn 29 The patient had phimosis, and had suffered for four years with incontinence of urine. For three months before death he had severe symptoms like those of stone in the bladder' The operation for phimosis was performed, but he died exhausted. Presented by Thomas Stone, Esq. 2371. Interstitial Nephritis, with atrophy of both kidneys, associated with dilated, varicosely-bulged and thickened ureters, and dilated and hypertrophied bladder. J r r This condition was probably due to obstruction to the outflow of urine from the bladder. 2372. A Kidney, showing considerable dilatation of the pelvis and calices with small deposits of yellow tubercular matter on the lining membrane ' The surface of the kidney is lobed, owing to the projection of the calices, and the parenchyma of the organ is thinned and distended in small pouches.

A Kidney, on the surface of which there are numerous small cysts contain- ing a thick dark-coloured fluid. The reflection of a portion of the capsule shows that the cysts are situated beneath it. xxvi. 11 CYSTIC DEGENERATION. 2382. An injected specimen of Cystic Degeneration of the Kidney. The kidney is seven and a half inches long, four inches broad, and weighs 21^ ounces. The surface is irregularly lobulated from the projection of cysts of various sizes, in the walls of which numerous minute vessels are seen ramifying. The pelvis is much dilated, and the calices are elongated, and extend nearly to the surface of the organ. The parenchyma is converted into congeries of cysts, of various sizes, from that of a walnut to a pea, enclosed in a matrix of connective tissue, which is extremely vascular. The cysts contained a dirty brown fluid, having the odour of decomposing urine. No trace of the normal tissue of the kidney is visible. An attempt was made to inject the uriniferous tubes from the ureter with prussian blue. Here and there a blue streak shows the existence of a tube, and nearly all of these lie immediately within the wall of a cyst. The injection had nowhere penetrated a cyst. The ureter was well- developed, patent, and not dilated. Microscopic Examination.—In the least altered portions of the kidney, the tubuli uriniferi were found generally dilated and tortuous, and the stages of transition from simple dilatation to the formation of cyst-like cavities could be traced. Normal Malphigian bodies were visible in places, but many were compressed, and under- going degeneration. Nowhere could a glomerulus be traced in transition into a cyst. The interstitial tissue was greatly increased, more in some sections than in others. Microscopic specimens are preserved, No. 94.THEIR PELVES, AND THE URETERS. 361 2383. The opposite Kidney, showing a similar change. The specimens were taken from a man, aged 47 years. He had been well until a week before hie admission to the Hospit al, when he was attacked by hematuria, When admitted, he passed a considerable quantity of urine, which was of sp. gr. 1010, pale, and contained a large amount of albumen. Two days later, uramiic coma developed itself, from which he died.—See Matthew Ward Book, July, 1879 j also Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxxi, 1880. 2384. Section of a Kidney, in the whole substance of which, membranous cysts, of various sizes, varying from that of a pin's head to that of a hazel nut, are thickly scattered. They contained a yellow, viscid, and transparent fluid. Their walls are thin and in close apposition. Only thin layers of the proper substance of the kidney could be discovered intervening between some of the cysts, and forming part of the exterior cortical layer. The vessels of the kidney are injected. xxvi. 20 2385. A section of the other Kidney, of the same person, uninjected.

Death took place twelve hours after the accident. The abdomen was found full of blood clots ; the liver was also much lacerated. The tenth rib was fractured.SERIES XXIX DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. HYPERTROPHY. 2395. The Bladder of a child, in which the muscular coat is exceedingly hyper- trophied. Its other tissues appear healthy. The child was 4 years old, and suffered intensely with signs of stone in the bladder : but no stone existed, nor was any disease found in the urethra or other part of the urinary organs. 2396. A Bladder, the coats of which are much thickened and indurated in con- sequence of the lodgment of a calculus in its cavity. The muscular coat is in some parts nearly half an inch thick; and the mucous membrane forms a tough white layer, from one to three lines in thickness, and raised in prominent folds in the cavity of the contracted bladder. The incision in the neck of the bladder was made in the performance of lithotomy. xxvn. 11 Presented by Charles Mayo, Esq.

PARTIAL DILATATION, OR SACCULATION. a. Of all the Coats. 2397. A Bladder, with an enlarged Prostate Gland. The bladder is much thickened ; its coats are indurated and consolidated; and its mucous membrane is in several parts incrusted with an irregular deposit of mucus mixed with calculous matter. At the upper and back part, immediately above the orifice of the left ureter, a portion of the bladder is distended into a sac of considerable size, of which the walls are thinner than those of the rest of the bladder, although all the coats appear to be comprised in the dilatation. xxvn. 32 239f. A Bladder, with part of tlie Urethra of a man on whom the operation of litliotrity was performed. There were two calculi in the bladder- one of moderate size, which was broken by the instrument; the other, of larger size was not detected by the instrument, being lodged in a deep recess formed by the dilatation of all the coats of the bladder at its lower and back part immediately behind the prostate gland.

Within two of these cysts calculi are lodged. Fifteen calculi were found in the cavity of the bladder: these—which are arranged by the sides of the sections—appear to be composed of uric acid; they weigh from 12 to 880 grains each; their total weight amounts to 2,703 grains. xxvii. 17 2400. A Bladder and Prostate Gland. The lateral lobes of the prostate are enlarged, and a small round tumour is formed by the projection of the third lobe into the bladder immediately behind the orifice of the urethra. The muscular coat of the bladder is much hypertrophied ; and its mucous mem- brane is thickened and indurated. At the upper part of the bladder is a small pouch communicating with its cavity by a narrow orifice, and apparently formed by a protrusion of the mucous membrane between the muscular fibres. xxvii. 24 2401. A Bladder, behind which is a sac nearly as large as itself. The sac, which probably had its origin in the protrusion of the mucous membrane of the bladder between its muscular fibres, communicates with the cavity of the bladder by a small round opening just above the orifice of the right ureter. The muscular coat of the bladder is much thickened ; its mucous membrane is healthy, but depressed in small pits between the muscular fibres. Above the communication of the sac with the bladder is an orifice, which was made by a trocar introduced from the rectum, for the relief of retention of urine. There is a smaller sac communicating with the bladder above the termination of the left ureter. xxvii. 10 2402. A Bladder and part of the Urethra, laid open on their anterior aspect. The muscular wall of the former is hypertrophied. Its mucous membrane is thick and coarsely rugous. On the right side, just above the orifice of the ureter, a narrow, funnel-shaped opening leads to a large pouch, lined by mucous membrane, but devoid of muscular tissue. The commencement of the membranous urethra is discoloured, and exhibits two apertures: one, to the left, terminates in a blind extremity; the other, passing behind the urethra, re-enters its canal at the beginning of its prostatic portion, where the latter is somewhat narrowed. xxvii. 41 From the body of a man who had suffered from stricture of the urethra. 2403. The Bladder of an old man, who had long suffered with stricture of the Urethra. Its muscular coat is thick, but weak and flaccid, and its mucous membrane is depressed in pits between the muscular fasciculi. On the right side are two large thick-walled sacs, each between three and four inches in diameter, communicating with the bladder by two small round apertures, and separated from each other by a partition formed by the union of their adjacent walls. They appear to have been formed by portions of the mucous membrane protruded, like hernias, between fasciculi of the muscular coat, and growing and thickening as they were gradually dilated. xxvii. 33 Presented by J. Gt. Johnson, Esq. 2404. A Bladder with a portion of the Urethra, from a man, aged 73 years, on whom the operation of lithotrity had been performed, and who died twelve days after the last crushing. The bladder, which is somewhat thickened, presents the usual appearances of acute ulcerative cystitis. A few fragments of calculous matter were found loose in the cavity, but the greater portions were found im- pacted in two small pouches, each of about the size and shape of a cob-nut. The fragments had evidently become impacted after the operation. The pouches are in the more dependent part of the bladder, near the orifices of the ureters,DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. 365 of which, however, they formed no part—See Abemethy Ward Boole, vol. i, p. 410.

A Bladder, in the posterior wall of which two abscesses have formed. The cavities of the abscesses are exposed by the removal of the peritoneum; they occupied circumscribed spaces between the peritoneal and mucous mem- branes, in which spaces the muscular fasciculi alone remain, the cellular tissue between them having been destroyed. In several places also the mucous membrane lining the intermuscular spaces has been destroyed, so that the abscesses communicated with the cavity of the bladder. xxvu. 34 ULCERATION. 2406. The Bladder of a woman, in which the mucous membrane has been com- pletely destroyed by ulceration. The bladder is small, and its muscular coat, exposed by the ulceration, appears hypertrophied. Small portions of calculous matter are deposited on the ulcerated surface. xxvu. 1 2407. A similar specimen, showing more plainly the enlarged fasciculi of the muscular coat exposed by the ulceration. xxvu. 20 Vide Nos. 2404, 2434. SLOUGHING- OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 2408. A Urinary Bladder, the mucous membrane of which has been entirely destroyed, except for an inch around the urethra, and the muscular coat is exposed. The bladder is somewhat dilated. The urethra is natural. The ureters were dilated to the size of a little finger, and their orifices into the bladder would admit a goose-quill. The kidneys were affected with suppurative nephritis. From a woman, aged 34 years, who had suffered with diabetes.—See Elizabeth Ward Book, vol. i, p. 348, and Post Mortem Book, toI. ii, p. 95. 2409. The specimen is apparently nearly the whole of the Mucous Membrane of the Uri nary Bladder, with a portion of the muscular coat, which was passed per urethram by a woman, aged 26 years. A month previously she was admitted into the Hospital on account of retention with incontinence of urine, and reti'o- version of the uterus, being at the time about four months pregnant.. Soon after her admission, 96 oz. of urine were drawn off with a catheter, and the urine was subsequently drawn off regularly every few hours. The expulsion of the substance shown in the specimen from the bladder was preceded by retention and acute pain in the hypogastrium, and on examination, the urethra being found blocked by some white-looking substance, the specimen was re- moved. For some months afterwards the patient was unable to hold her urine for more than from five to twenty minutes at a time. When last seen (about eight months afterwards), she was in much the same condition. Her o-eneral health was good. She was delivered of a healthy child at about the full time. 2410. The entire Mucous Membrane of a Bladder separated, as a slough, in one piece. Its tissues do not appear materially changed. The sub-mucous tissue is clean and flocculent, as if only macerated after being separated by dissection. The mucous surface appears, in some parts, excoriated or superficially ulcerated' and much of it is sprinkled over with phosphatic deposits. xxvu. 36 2411. The remains of the Bladder, from which the mucous membrane in the preceding specimen, sloughed. The exposed muscular coat appears infiltrated,DISEASES AND INJURIES OP THE URINARY BLADDER. 366 and covered with lymph and mucus. Parts of it, also, are destroyed by ulcera- tion, exposing the external and peritoneal coverings of the bladder; and in one of these parts, near one of the dilated ureters, complete perforation into the peritoneal cavity has taken place. xxvu. 37 The patient was a woman, between 40 and 50. About three weeks before her death, a small tumour was removed from her fore-arm. She died with typhoid symptoms, but no sign of diseased urinary organs was, at any time, complained of or observed. TUBERCULAR ULCERATION. 2412. A Urinary Bladder, on the inner surface of which, especially near the neck, are several oval tubercular ulcers, about the size of a threepenny piece; their bases are irregular, and covered with breaking-down tubercular matter. From a woman, aged 34 years, whose lungs contained miliary tubercles ; the right kidney and ureter were also affected with tubercular disease. The ureter is preserved in No. 2343.—See Post Mortem Boole, vol. viii, p. 188. 2413. A Bladder, exhibiting numerous distinct circular ulcers on the mucous membrane. At the bases of some of these ulcers there are small tubercular deposits. The intervening portions of the mucous membrane, to the borders of the ulcers, are healthy. xxvu. 31 There were tubercles in the lungs and other organs, and the kidneys were affected with tubercular disease. 2414. Part of a Bladder and its Ureters. The entire mucous surface of the former is converted into a rough villous texture, being part of a layer of con- siderable thickness which has taken the place of the natural lining. In the recent state it was soft and of a pale yellow colour, and was formed by a deposit of tubercular matter in the mucous and sub-mucous tissues. This condition extends up the left ureter, and involved the calices and tubuli of the corre- sponding kidney. The right ureter remains unaffected. Part of the penis, including the glans, is suspended in front, and the urethra is laid open, to show that the diseased condition prevails to its very extremity. xxvn. 40 From the body of a boy who had long suffered from symptoms of vesical disease, which at first simulated those of a calculus in the bladder. Large quantities of broken-down scrofulous material were constantly passed with the urine. A drawing of the kidney, No. 323, shows its recent appearance. 2415. A Bladder, in which diffuse ulceration (? tubercular) has removed the mucous membrane around its urethral orifice. Near the margin of the diffuse ulceration is a small, oval ulcer, with sharp, abrupt margins. xxvu. 3 2416. A Bladder, in which nearly the whole of the mucous membrane has been removed by ulceration (? tubercular.) xxvu. 19 TUMOURS (and Allied Morbid Growths) OP THE BLADDER. VILLOUS TUMOUR. 2417. A Bladder, with a uniformly enlarged Prostate Gland. Its muscular coat is thickened. A soft, flocculent, and very vascular villous growth is attached by a narrow base to the mucous membrane at the lower and posterior part of the bladder, immediately behind the orifice of the urethra. A portion of glass is introduced into a pouch or sac formed by the mucous membrane of a part of the lateral wall of the bladder protruded between the muscular fibres. There are two similar small pouches of the mucous membrane on the opposite side of the bladder, close to the termination of the ureter. xxvn- 25 The morbid growth was the source of frequent and profuse ha;morrhage. Presented by Herbert Evans, Esq.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. 3G7 2418. A Bladder, with a soft and shreddy villous tumour growing from the mucous membrane near the centre of its posterior wall. xxvu. 2 FIBROUS TUMOUR. 2419. A Bladder, laid open by a vertical incision through its anterior wall. A pedunculated growth is attached to its inner surface, stretching transversely across the fundus of the bladder, immediately behind the apertures of the ureters, which are much dilated. The mass is attached at either side, but free in the centre, and was so situated that it might lie forward over the urethral orifice, or be propelled in that direction when attempts were made to void the urine. The tumour, irregularly lobulated, consists of a fine filamentous structure scattered through a granular substance, and invested by a quantity of tessel- lated epithelium. The walls of the bladder are much thickened. At its upper surface the cavity of an abscess commences and extends to the umbilicus, but no communication can be traced between the two, although the urine continued to escape by the abscess up to the time of the child's death. The small papilla close to the vesical termination of the abscess is all that appears of the urachus. A bristle passed some way down it, but could not, without violence, be forced into the bladder. xxvu. 39 From a child who had suffered for eight weeks from extreme pain during micturition, presently followed by severe pain in the abdomen. A swelling formed about the umbilicus, softened, and was opened with a lancet, some healthy pus escaping. Urine began to dribble away from this opening, scarcely any escaping by the natural channel. The child, after lingering in a wretched state for some days, died. The case is described by Mr. Savory, in the Transactions of the Abernethian Society, Part I, vol. ii. EPITHELIAL, VILLOUS, AND MEDULLARY CANCER. 2420. A Bladder, the mucous membrane of which is covered with nodules and flattened plaques probably of epithelioma. At the fundus the whole thickness of the wall of the bladder is infiltrated by the morbid growth. . xxvu. 5 2421. A Bladder exhibiting several irregular papillomatous growths springing from its mucous membrane, probably epithelioma. xxvu. 6 2422. A Bladder having a soft cancerous growth springing from the trigone, and involving the third lobe of the prostate. The surface of the growth is ragged, appears villous, and was sloughy in the recent state. The bladder was distended and contained numerous blood clots. The tumour was found on microscopic examination to be a villous cancer. From a man, aged 69 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with the following history :— Four years ago he passed some blood with the urine for the first time ; and the urine continued to contain blood for a few weeks. Since then he has had about six attacks of heematuria, with intermissions lasting sometimes as long as six months. The present attack of hsematuria dates from about four months ago, and is the longest and most severe he has had. The passage of urine was preceded by several stringy clots, which obstructed the flow. The urine was of a dark blood colour. No evidence of the disease was obtained by the use of the sound or by microscopic examination of the urine. The autopsy revealed numerous soft secondary deposits in the liver, and some of the bones were softened.—See Mark Ward Book vol ix p. 57. ' ' 2423. A Bladder, exhibiting a general thickening of its coats, and a large mass of soft medullary substance attached to the mucous membrane of its posterior wall, just above the prostate gland. A sac, as large as the bladder itself, and filled by a similar growth, communicates with the lower and posterior part of the bladder. This sac was situated between the muscular coat of the bladder and the peritoneum covering its posterior wall; one of the ureters terminates in it by an opening through which a quill is passed. A passage has been formed through the prostate gland by a silver catheter. xxvu. 15 The man from whom this specimen was taken had difficulty in passing urine, and occasionalDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. 3G8 retention, for two years. In the last attack of retention the prostate gland, as shown in this specimen, was pierced; but the withdrawal of the urine did not reduce a swelling, felt above the pubes, and which was produced by the bladder pressed forward by the cyst full of the morbid growth. It is uncertain whether this cyst is formed by dilatation of the ureter, or by mucous membrane protruded from the bladder between its muscidar fibres; the latter supposition is more probable. 2424. A Bladder, half the cavity of which is filled by a broken-down, soft, and flocculent mass of soft cancer. The rest of its internal surface is superficially ulcerated. xxvn. 7 2425. The Bladder of a middle-aged woman, the mucous membrane of which is extensively destroyed by ulceration, probably cancerous. xxvn. 26 Presented by Henry Bateman, Esq. 2426. The Bladder of a man, aged 45, who for two or three years before his death had suffered from hematuria and other symptoms of a foreign body m the bladder. The bladder is laid open by a vertical incision through its front wall. It is much thickened and indurated; and, springing from the region of the neck, and so extending as to involve the orifices of the ureters and urethra, is a large lobulated cancerous tumour, which occupies a considerable portion of the cavity. The lower surface is ulcerated. xxvn. 45 2427. The Bladder of a man, aged 59, in the lower portion of the anterior wall of which is a considerable growth of cancer. Portions of the disease project into the adjacent parts of the cavity. The prostatic portion of the urethra is distorted. xxvn. 44 2428. The Bladder of a woman, with its cavity nearly filled by a large tumour, which apparently originated within the coats of its posterior part. Portions of glass are passed into the ureters, which open on the front surface of the tumour. The tumour is pale, soft, spongy, and of medullary character. xxvn. 27 2429. A Bladder, affected with medullary cancer. Two large masses of disease are to be seen, which affect the muscular as well as the mucous coats of the bladder, whilst the lesser raised patches are limited to the mucous membrane, and even to its more superficial layers. Around the opening of the right ureter is a mass of cancer infiltrating the muscular coat. From a man, aged 57 years, who had had symptoms of the disease for about six months before death.—See Pitcaim Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 101. 2430. A Bladder, with firm, round tumours between the mucous and muscular coats of its fundus.

A portion of the front of the bladder is destroyed by ulceration ; the remaining part is thickened and diffusely ulcerated. A large calculus is lodged within the prostate gland, in which it appears gradually to have formed a cavity of such size that only a thin layer of the proper substance of the gland remains around it. XXVII. 13 2435. A Urinary Bladder, somewhat dilated and with some thickening of its wall. At the neck is a cavity extending towards the rectum, and occupying the position of the prostate gland, in which a soft phosphatic calculus lies. The specimen was taken from a child, aged 3 years, who for six months had suffered from frequent, difficult, and painful micturition, for which circumcision had been performed. The stone was not detected with the sound. The child died suddenly. The right kidney is pre- ferred in Series XXVIII, No. 2372 i the left kidney was healthy.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 55. 2436. The Urinary Bladder of a fat pig. It contains a large quantity of crystal- line and fatty-looking material, mixed with long bristles : and the hoof seen suspended in the bottle was found imbedded in this material, which completely filled the bladder and appeared to block up the urethra, when the viscus was opened. The crystalline substance consists of triple phosphates. It appears probable that the hoof and hairs found their way into the bladder from a dermoid cyst, or extra-uterine foetation, and that these determined the deposit of phosphates. CALCULOUS DEPOSIT ON THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 2437. The Bladder of a girl, 13 years old. Its muscular coat is very thick, strong, and fasciculated. Its mucous membrane also is thickened and deeply wrinkled, and the summits of many of the wrinkles are coated with grains of calculous matter.

The Bladder and Kidneys of a man upon whom the operation of lithotomy was performed five years before death. The cicatrix in the mucous membrane within the prostate and neck of the bladder is distinctly visible, and a mem- branous band extends across it between the front and back parts of the prostate, leaving a small channel, marked by a piece of glass, where it is probable that a portion of the wound in the prostate did not heal. One kidney is much reduced by the absorption of its glandular substance; and its infundibula, pelvis, and a portion of the ureter, are filled by a large branched calculus. In the other kidney the infundibula are dilated and filled by several calcnli. xxvn. 23 The patient had considered himself healthy from the time at which he underwent lithotomy; but for some weeks before his death the symptoms of disease of the kidneys were evident. Vide Nos. 2396, 2434. TAPPING OF THE BLADDER. 2445. The Bladder and Urethra of a man, whose bladder was punctured above the pubes, twelve years before death, on account of stricture of the urethra. The walls of the bladder are thickened, and small pouches of its mucous membrane are protruded between the muscular fibres. Connected with the front of the bladder is the fistulous tract extending through the parietes of the abdomen, through which the patient discharged his urine from the time of the puncture of his bladder to his death ; it is lined by membrane similar to, and continuous with, the mucous membrane of the bladder. The urethra is contracted in its whole length, but pervious. A tough fibrous band, an inch in length, and attached only by its extremities, extends from the veru montanum forwards to the membranous part of the urethra. xxvn. 28 2445a. A Bladder, with an enlarged Prostate Gland, from a man whose bladder had been punctured above the pubes eight years before death. The fistulous passage through which the urine was discharged is about four inches in length and extends from the front of the bladder immediately above the prostate, through the abdominal walls. A piece of glass is introduced into this passage. The lateral lobes of the prostate are enlarged, and a distinct portion of the gland, flattened and triangular, projects into the bladder immediately behind the orifice of the urethra. XX1X- 16 A calculus, preserved in Series LII, was found in the bladder. Vide also Nos. 2401 and 2829.

EFFUSION OF BLOOD ON OR BETWEEN THE MEMBRANES. 2446. A large Clot of Blood between the dura mater and the lateral part of a skull. vi. 39 The blood was effused from the arteria meningea media, which was ruptured by external violence. 2447. Portion of a Brain and its membranes from a lunatic. Blood has been effused between the dura mater and the parietal arachnoid, forming a layer of considerable thickness, firm and partially decolorised. The visceral arachnoid is coated with recently effused lymph. 17 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2448. A large Clot of Blood, adhering to the internal surface of the dura mater which covered the upper part of one of the hemispheres of the cerebrum. vi. 38 The effusion was in consequence of external injury.

Portion of Dura Mater, exhibiting a newly-formed, thin, and nearly transparent membrane, closely adherent to its internal surface, and consisting of two layers, which form a large sac containing coagulated blood. vi. 45 The patient was a young man who had an attack of apoplexy, followed by paralysis of the right side and occasional convulsions, a short time before death. The effusion of blood com- pressed the right side of the brain. 2450. Portion of Dura Mater, exhibiting a newly-formed membrane upon its internal surface. This membrane lines the whole of the dura mater covering the right hemisphere of the cerebrum; its thickness is about equal to that of the peritoneum, and it is very vascular throughout. It has been completely separated from the dura mater, except along one edge, where it is still adherent, ?? A observed that this edge is insensibly lost upon the dura mater, so that the outer surface of the new membrane and that of the dura mater appear to be continuous The cerebral surface of the membrane is rust-coloured like partially decolorised blood. Towards its lower part the new membrane is thicker than above, and it is here divisible into two distinct layers. vi. \ The patient had been deranged for three years before his death. He had had no sums of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, but, shortly before his death, had he2 of the left side.

About its centre is a considerable portion, soft and flocculent on the surface next to the bone. When recent, it was of a brownish colour, the discoloration extending through to its arachnoid surface. At two points perforations existed. The whole of the discoloured part seemed to be in a sloughing condition. The petrous bone, subjacent to this portion of dura mater, was carious, and the tympanum was full of pus.

Portion of Cerebrum, with an extensive effusion of blood upon its surface beneath the arachnoid membrane. 2471. An Aneurism of the Anterior Communicating Artery. The aneurism, about the size of a hempseed, had ruptured, and blood was poured out into the pia mater of the brain and spinal cord. The left ventricle of the Heart was much hypertrophied ; the left kidney was much atro- phied, the cause of atrophy being not apparent. No thrombi were discovered anywhere. No atheroma of aorta or of meningeal arteries. From a man, aged 20 years.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. ii, p. 338. 2472. Cerebellum, Pons, and Medulla Oblongata, from a man, aged 45 years. Upon the basilar artery was an aneurism the size of a grain of wheat, which had burst. The blood had broken through the lamina cinerea into the ventricles. The pia mater from the chiasma opticum down to the cauda equina was full of blood. The arteries at the base of the brain were rigid; the heart natural. See JOuke Ward Book, January, 1871, p. 4. For other Specimens of Cerebral Aneurism, see Series VIII, JVos. 1516 to 1530. 2473. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is a large dark apoplectic clot of blood, apparently recently effused. There is also an effusion of blood upon the surface of the brain, beneath the arachnoid membrane. The blood within the brain is loosely connected with the sides of the cavity in which it lies. vi. 9 2474. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there is an apoplectic clot of longer standing. The blood, partially decolorised, is of a much lighter colour, and appears drier, than that in the preceding specimen. The surface of the clot is in close contact with the adjacent substance of the brain, vi. 10 The specimen was taken from a person who had had two apoplectic attacks at distant periods. 2475. Portion of Cerebrum, in the substance of which is a dark, apoplectic clot of blood, recently effused. Blood is also effused under the pia mater. 1 From the collection of J. E. Farre, Esq., M.D. 2476. Portion of Cerebrum, containing a large apoplectic clot of about six months' standing. The red colour has in great measure disappeared. 2 From the same patient as the preceding specimen.

The vuttM of the clot is closely united to the substance of the brain which atao appe^j more smooth than that immediately surrounding the clots in the pieceamg specimens. 2479. Portions of Cerebrum, in the substance of which are the two parts of a cavity which contained a serous fluid, and which was, probably, formed by tnc complete removal of an apoplectic effusion, such as is shown m earlier stages in the preceding specimens. The form of the cavity is irregular, but its interior is smooth, and the adjacent substance of the brain appears healthy. ^ The patient was 40 years old, and had an apoplectic attack about four months before his death. 2480. A similar specimen; but the interior of the cavity is smoother than that in the preceding specimen. VI" 2481. A Section of a Cerebellum and Pons, with a clot of blood recently effused in the middle of the Pons. VL 65 The effusion appeared to be the cause of sudden death in a person who was already hemiplegio from a former attack of apoplexy. 2482. Section of a Pons Varolii, showing a small clot of blood in its substance. From a man, aged 35 years, who was admitted into the Hospital twenty-four days before death with delirium and vomiting. He was sensible when spoken to, and complained of headache ; con- sciousness remained until within half an hour of his death. There was no convulsion or difficulty of respiration. The lateral ventricles contained about 5 oz. of fluid, and the convolutions of the hemispheres were much flattened. The vessels of the brain and the cranial sinuses were remark- ably anaemic. 2483. Section of the Pons Varolii, and of some adjacent structures. A con- siderable quantity of blood is effused into its substance, the clots presenting a striated appearance. ^ In this case the fatal effusion took place into the substance of the cerebrum.

Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting an abscess in its anterior lobe, which com- municated with the lateral ventricle of the same side. vi. 22 The patient was a man, 40 years old, who appeared to die exhausted by syphilis and the effects of mercury. The only cerebral symptoms were extreme restlessness and delirium at night. The case is related by Mr. Earle, in the Medical and Physical Journal, vol. xxxiii, p. 89. London, 1810. 2486. Portion of Cerebrum, in the left hemisphere of which there is a cavity an inch and a half in diameter, which contained pus. The cavity is situated immediately over the fissura Sylvii; its walls are distinct, thin, smooth on both surfaces, and easily separable from the surrounding substance of the brain. vi. 29 The patient had purulent discharge from the left ear for five weeks before his death. He died suddenly. The petrous portion of the temporal bone, over which the abscess was situated, was extensively diseased. The portion of brain between the abscess and the bone was dark and sloughy.6<b DISEASES AND INJURIES OP THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES. 2487. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting an abscess in the upper part of one of its hemispheres, with the dura mater which covered it. The abscess communi- cates with the lateral ventricle by the aperture through which a bristle is passed. The internal surface of the abscess is rough, and that of the ventricle is lined by lymph. Lymph is also deposited upon the dura mater, and there is an ulcerated aperture in it, which communicated with the cavity of the abscess, and through which a bristle is passed. yl 47 The patient, a child, 4 years old, had an extensive scalp-wound of the right side, followed hy suppuration, sloughing, and exposure of the cranium. A month after the injury was received, and while all seemed proceeding favourably, the child was seized with convulsions, which were followed by partial paralysis and insensibility. By the trephine, a small quantity of matter was let out from between the skull and dura mater, but witbout relief 3 and the child died tbree days after the convulsions began. Vide Series L, No. 3232. TUMOURS (and Othee Allied Morbid Growths) IN THE BRAIN. CASEOUS OR TUBERCULAR TUMOURS. 2488.

One of these masses occupies the greater part of the interior of the tuber annulare. vi. 40 2489. Section of the upper part of one hemisphere of a Cerebrum, exhibiting a large oval mass of caseous matter in its substance and between the mem- branes. A portion of the dura mater has a thick layer of tubercular matter adhering to its inner surface. vi. 48 From the same man as the penis, Series XL, No. 2887. 2490. A Cerebellum, with the Pons and Medulla Oblongata. A large irregularly oval mass of caseous matter is imbedded in the inferior and posterior part of one hemisphere of the cerebellum. A section of the tumour displays the uniform, soft, yellow substance of which it is composed. vi. 50 The patient was 20 years old, and phthisical. Five months before death he began to com- plain of coldness and numbness from the feet to the knees ; this gradually increased, till three weeks later he had almost complete loss of sensation and voluntary motion up to the hips, attended with extreme rigidity and convulsive movements of the muscles of the lower extremities, and of the abdomen, and perhaps also of those of the thorax. The involuntary movements became less, but the loss of sensation more complete, till the patient died. His intellect was unaffected till three days before death. Presented by Thomas Warner, Esq. 2491. A Cerebellum, on the upper surface of which an irregularly oval mass of caseous matter, rather more than an inch in diameter, is deeply imbedded. The mass was connected with the inferior surface of the tentorium cerebelli, and has been in part detached from the cerebellum, to which it was very loosely attached : it presents a few scattered points of softening. vi. 72 From a lad, 18 years old, who had severe pain in the head, with strabismus and impairment of speech. The first two symptoms subsided during the rapid development of tubercular disease in the lungs and small intestines. 2492. A caseous Tumour lying in an indentation on the right side of the medulla oblongata, which is compressed by it. The tumour appears not to be continuous with the substance of the medulla, but is easily separated from its bed. The section of the growth is smooth, homogeneous, and slightly granular; in the recent state it was of a yellowish-white colour. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consisted of tubercular material, in parts reticular, and containing giant-cells with processes, continuous with the reticulum ; in others cellular, and again in other parts the elements were almost indistinguishable owing to caseous degeneration.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES. 377 The specimen was token from a child, aged 2 years. The only nerve lesion observed was left facial paralysis ; she had a strumous finger. Miliary tubercles were found in the lungs but not in the brain or other organs. The bronchial glands were caseous ; they are preserved m Series XXIV, No. 2281.— See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 204. Microscopic sections of the tumour are preserved, No. 99. 2493.

The natural structure of the cerebellum is almost entirely removed, and in its place there is a firm whitish substance, with specks of calcareous matter scattered through it. TL. 20 CALCAREOUS TUMOURS. 2495. The left Corpus Striatum and Optic Thalamus with the Pons Varolii and ad jacent parts of the brain. Lying partly in the posterior extremity of the third ventricle and partly in a smooth-walled space in the left optic thalamus, is a white, rough, and spiculated calcareous nodule of the size of a hazel-nut. Its surface is quite free except at the lower and posterior part, where a rather dense fibrous tissue is continuous with its structure. The brain substance on which it lies, and both crura cerebri, contain a large quantity of tough fibrous tissue which is continuous with the pia mater. The specimen was taken from a young man, aged 19 years, who was brought to the Hospital in an apoplectic fit, and died twelve hours later. The lateral ventricles were filled with blood, which appeared to have issued from the outer and back part of the left optic thalamus. The calcareous nodule had apparently no connection with the haemorrhage, the optic thalamus in its neighbourhood being perfectly healthy. There were pendulous vegetations on the mitral valve. With the exception of a fit some years before, he had had no cerebral symptoms. Microscopic examination of the brain substance showed a slight increase of the neuroglia in the neighbourhood of the tumour.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 109. 2496. Portion of Cerebrum, with a small, conical, bone-like tumour, which, apparently originating in the pia mater, has penetrated between the convolu- tions into the substance of the brain.

Part of the Base of the Brain, from the patient from whom the eye, preserved in Series XXXIII, No. 2633, was extirpated. An oval mass of dark- grey, medullary and melanotic substance (like that external to the eye), is imbedded in the surface of the brain, and compresses the optic commissure the left optic nerve, and the left carotid artery. It is loosely connected with the brain ; and the adjacent cerebral substance appears unchanged. ix. 24 A microscopic section is preserved, No. 101. 2499... Portions of Cerebrum, in the substance of which there are several sarcomatous tumours of different sizes. The sections of some of these tumours show that they are of a firm consistence ; and that blood is effused in the interior of some, and upon the surfaces of others.

Section of a Tumour, which pervaded the brain from the surface of the hemispheres to the base of the cerebrum. In its progress it involved parts from which the optic nerves are believed to arise. The ventricles contained rather an excess of serum. The cerebellum presented a natural appearance. There was a similar deposit in the kidneys. 15 From a woman between 20 and 30 years of age, who had suffered from amaurosis for more than two months.

Sections of a round-cell Sarcoma, which occupied the interior of the lateral ventricles of a boy, aged 12. The tumour is of irregularly oval form, knobbed on its surface, and measures from three to four inches in its diameters. It appears to consist throughout of a soft medullary substance. Portions of the choroid plexus are attached to one of its surfaces. vi. 51 The boy had from infancy been subject to severe pain in the head; eight months before death he became amaurotic and of weak intellect. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 104. Presented by W. C. Clough, Esq. CANCERS. 2502. The Base of a Brain. The superior and anterior portion of the cerebellum is occupied by a soft cancer, of a white colour mottled with red, which extends downwards into the centre of the cerebellum, and projects forwards through the transverse fissure into the ventricles as a roundish nodule about the size oE a marble. In the centre of the cerebellum the tumour is uniformly red; it passes indefinitely into the surrounding brain substance. The ventricular cavities are somewhat dilated, and the aqueduct of Sylvius is obliterated. Microscopic Examination.—The microscopic characters of the growth are those of cancer, which probably originated from the endothelium of the empendyma. History.—The specimen was taken from a man, aged 30 years ; about seven or eight weeks before his admission to the Hospital he went to the Moorfields Ophthalmic Hospital, on account of dimness of vision. During the last six weeks he had suffered from severe frontal head- ache and restless nights ; and for the last ten days from constant vomiting. He was, on admission, very restless, but dull and stupid. The respirations were irregular and very slow, four per minute; the pulse, full, fifty-eight per minute. There was double optic neuritis and photophobia, but no squint. No paralysis. A slight internal strabismus was noticed some days later but otherwise he continued in much the same condition, at times being more stupid, and then improving again. Finally he became comatose, and died a month after admission.—See John Ward Book, voL vii, p. 73. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 105. 2502a. Portions of Brain, in which there are small circumscribed cancerous tumours.

Portions of the Base of a Skull, with a diseased Pituitary Gland and other adjacent parts. The natural substance of the pituitary gland is lost in a mass of firm, pale, semi-transparent, granular, medullary substance, which extends from the gland into both the left and the right cavernous sinuses. In the left cavernous sinus, the several nerves are lost in the morbid growth, which also protrudes on the inner side of the left Casserian ganglion, and somewhat com- presses it. On the right side the nerves are in contact with the surface of the tumour. TI- 73 The patient, a man, 47 years old, had, for about fire months before death, paralysis of the muscles of the left eye-ball and of the left levator palpebrse, with dilation of the pupil, and im- pairment, but not loss, of vision. In the last month of his life he had similar paralysis on the left side. He died with new growths in the salivary and cervical lymphatic glands, and with some apparently cancerous masses in the lungs.

ENTOZOA IN THE BRAIN. 2507. The right half of a Cerebrum. In its centre there is a cavity, in which a large hydatid was contained. The cavity is lined by a thin false membrane. It is much reduced in size by the contraction of the brain; the apertures in it were made after death. The adjacent cerebral substance is healthy. vi. 60 2508. The Hydatid Cyst from the preceding brain. When full, it con- tained between five and six ounces of fluid. VI. 61 From a girl, 5 years old, in whom signs of cerebral disease had existed for a year before death. For the last three months of her life, she had partial paralysis of motion on the left side.

Choroid Plexuses, in which there are small thin-walled cysts containing a soft substance. vi. 27 Many of the lymphatic glands of the patient were enlarged, and contained a substance similar to that which fills these cysts. HYDROCEPHALUS. 2513. A Brain affected with internal hydrocephalus. The lateral ventricles of either side, and the third and fourth ventricles are much dilated; the aqueduct of Sylvius is of about the normal calibre. These cavities contained a slightly turbid serous fluid. The lining membrane of the ventricles is thickened and opaque. A thick opaque and vascular membrane, continuous with the pia mater, extended from the posterior part of the median lobe of the cerebellum to the posterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata, completely closing in the fourth ventricle ; no aperture could be detected in it. Only the remains of this structure are now to be seen. The layers of pia mater lining the inner surface of the hemispheres and fissure of Sylvius had coalesced. No tubei*cles are visible. The central canal of the spinal cord was not dilated. From a woman, aged 27 years. She had been ailing since her confinement, which occurred six months before her admission to the Hospital. Five weeks ago she became strange in manner and wandered at night. Soon after her admission, persistent vomiting, with noisy delirium at night, came on. Her temperature was raised irregularly, occasionally as high as 102° Falir. She had on one occasion an epileptiform convulsion, lasting three-quarters of an hour. Finally she lapsed into a state of amentia, and died eleven weeks from the commencement of her illness.— See Faith Ward Book, vol. ix. p. 146. 2514. Part of the Brain of a man, 28 years old, who had hydrocephalus in his infancy, and whose head was enlarged and somewhat deformed in consequence of that disease. The whole of the internal surface of the ventricles is finely granulated, and appeared to be indurated. The inferior surface of the edges of the fornix is intimately adherent to the surface of the choroid plexus, and, through its medium, to the upper surface of the optic thalami. vi. 64< The mind of the patient appeared in no degree affected by this disease : he was a very skilful furniture-painter ; and died of a disease independent of the state of his brain. 2515. Section of a lateral Ventricle of the Brain dilated from hydrocephalus. 6 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M,D. 2516.

Farre, Esq., M.D. 2517. Portion of Cerebrum, exhibiting the septum lucidum stretched in conse- quence of the distension of the lateral ventricles with fluid. In the anterior portion of the septum there is a large irregular opening traversed by thin shreds ; and the posterior portion of the septum, which remains, is very thin. vi. 41 2518. A similar specimen, except that the opening is in the posterior portion of the septum lucidum, and has smoother and more even edges. vi. 42 HYDROCEPHALIC SKULLS. 2519. Skull of a girl, 11 years old. The enlargement of the skull in consequence of hydrocephalus is effected by its elongation, and by the depression and hollowing of its base. An increase of width appears to have been prevented by the premature and complete closure of the sagittal suture. The coronal suture, and that between the frontal bone and the lesser alee of the sphenoid, are widely open. The superior walls of the orbits are pressed downwards.

Portion of Cerebrum through which a bullet passed in the track which is indicated by a piece of glass, and which terminates in a rounded cavity, wherein the bullet was lodged. vi. 31 The patient fired two pistols into his mouth. He appeared to suffer but little from the injury, and was able to rise from his bed on the sixth day after the injury. He died with haemorrhage on the twelfth day. HERNIA CEREBRI. 2525. Portions of Brain, Skull, and Cerebral Membranes, exhibiting a Hernia Cerebri. The front of the preparation shows a vertical section of the protrusion and of the part of the brain from which it has arisen. In the centre of the protruded brain, which consists of medullary substance, the vessels have given way and blood is effused in it. The portions of the skull and of the membranes of the brain surrounding the base of the protrusion, were included in the section, for the purpose of showing how the protrusion has taken place through the openings formed by ulceration in the dura mater and pia mater, and through the aperture in the bone. vi. 32 2526. Section of the protruded Brain last described. The deep groove which intervenes between the outer part of the protruded mass and the portion of brain from which it has arisen, was occupied by the bone and by the membranes of the brain. vi. 33 The patient, a boy, 13 years old, had extensive fracture of the frontal bone, and several portions of bone were removed without injury of the dura mater. The protrusion of the brain began on the fifth day after the injury, and increased, without disturbance of the intellect or other remarkable symptoms, till the tenth day, when the protruded mass, consisting of healthy cortical and medullary substance, was cut off. For the next ten days the protrusion w as restrained by firm pressure; but, insensibility ensuing, the pressure was discontinued: the protrusion at once again made progress, and the patient died on the twenty-seventh day after receiving the injury, with softening of the brain. The case is published by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. viii, p. 22. London, 1817. 2527. Portion of the Brain and its Membranes and of the right Frontal Bore of a boy, aged 8 years, who four months before his death sustained a compound fracture of the right frontal bone. A fortnight after the accident a portion of382 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES. the brain began to protrude which gradually increased until his death. From time to time serum and pus were let out from the wouud, always with relief to the cerebral symptoms. A considerable portion of cerebral snbstance protrudes beyond the integuments, and the section shows its continuity with the rest of the brain. Beneath the adjacent portion of dura mater is a large cavity which was filled with pus. 2528. Several large portions of Cerebrum, which protruded in a case of Hernia Cerebri, and were removed during life. vi. 23 The patient was a boy.. 12 years old. He had fracture with depression about the lambdoid suture. Portions of bone were removed without injury of the dura mater; on the tenth day after the fracture, the hernia of the brain appeared, and in three days was as large as an orange. He died on the third day after the removal of these portions of brain, in which, when first removed, both the cortical and medullary substance presented a natural appearance. The case is described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. vih, p. 14. London, 1817. 2529. Portions of Cerebrum, which protruded in a case of Hernia Cerebri, and were removed during life. vi. 34 The patient, a boy, 11 years old, had fracture of the frontal bone, several portions of which were removed, without injury to the dura mater. The protrusion began on the seventh day ; it was twice removed, and as often reproduced ; but the portion last protruded sloughed off, and the patient completely recovered. The case is published by Mr. Stanley, with the preceding one. 2530. False Hernia Cerebri.

DISEASES AND INJUKIES OF THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. —♦— DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE SPINAL CORD. EFFUSION OF BLOOD BETWEEN THE MEMBRANES. 2531. Dorsal and Lumbar Portions of a Spinal Cord, in which a considerable quantity of blood has been effused in the tissue of the pia mater, especially on the anterior aspect, and about the roots of the nerves. There are several milk- white, oval, and irregular spots, like portions of cartilage, upon the arachnoid. The substance of the cord itself is healthy. vn. 9 From an elderly woman, who, three weeks before her death, had an attack of cerebral apoplexy, the symptoms of which were slight, though between two and three ounces of blood were effused in the anterior lobes of the cerebrum and in the membranes and arachnoid sac coyering them, and at the base of the skull. The time at which the effusion into the spinal membranes happened is uncertain. A drawing is preserved, No. 381. EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION (SPINAL MENINGITIS). EFFUSION OF LYMPH, &o. 2532. Spinal Cord and its Membranes from a case of rapidly progressive Spinal Meningitis. Thick greenish lymph extends from the cauda equina to the cervical enlargement. It lies between the pia mater and arachnoid. The cord itself appeared softened, but not otherwise altered. The inflammation is thought to have extended from an abscess (from which the patient had suffered for many months) along the sacral or lumbar nerves, through the intervertebral foramina and so along the cord.—See Lawrence Ward Booh, vol. iv, p. 377. 2533. Portion of a Spinal Cord partially surrounded by a firm, irregularly shaped deposit, contained between the dura mater and the neighbouring ver- tebrae, involving through its pressure the adjacent nerves. vn. 12 From a man who had suffered from paraplegia for a considerable time preceding his death. 2534. Portion of a Spinal Cord, with its Membranes, exhibiting a firm, tabu- lated, mass in the tissue behind and by the sides of the dura mater, within the third, fourth, and fifth dorsal vertebras. The spinal cord was compressed by it, but not otherwise altered. yn> q The patient was 36 years old. He had slight signs of the disease about fifteen months before death. For the last six months of his life he had paraplegia.

More superficially, there were deposits of pus beneath the trapezius and other muscles of the back. The tumour was loosely connected with both the dura mater and the vertebrae. The vertebra? were softened, but in other respects healthy. 2535. Part of the Dorsal Portion of a Spinal Cord, with a thick irregular layer of lymph and tubercular matter surrounding the dura mater, and slightly compressing the cord. Both the cord and the dura mater appear healthy in their texture. vn. 10 The patient was a young man who had paraplegia, which he believed to have originated in a sprain. Tubercular matter was deposited in and upon the adjacent vertebrae; and some of their intervertebral cartilages, as well as their own texture, were destroyed. There was no dis- tortion of the spine.

Portion of the Dura Mater enveloping the bundle of nerves constituting the Cauda Equina. A tumour, of a firm fibrous texture, is connected with the external surface of the dura mater, and being wholly contained within the spinal canal, made considerable pressure upon the nerves. vu. 4 The patient, 33 years old, was suddenly seized with pains in the loins and paraplegia, and with acute pain affecting the lower extremities. The paralysis extended upwards ; sloughs formed on the sacrum j and he died two months after the beginning of his illness. CANCER. 2540. The Cervical Portion of a Spine. A soft brain-like tumour is seen pro- jecting on the left side of the column, and surrounding the nerves, some of which are enlarged and infiltrated. The growth is attached to the posterior surface of the dura mater, and the left side and posterior surface of the spinal cord is slightly compressed from the fourth to the sixth vertebras. A portion of the fourth cervical vertebra is softened and infiltrated with the growth. The tumour was found on microscopic examination to be a carcinoma. There was a growth having the same naked-eye characters in the pancreas, and secondary deposits were found in the hver. From a man, aged 46 years, who, when first seen, complained of pain and loss of power in the left upper arm. The deltoid and biceps muscles wasted, and after an interval the left arm became completely paralysed. Later he gradually lost power in the right arm, and finally paralysis of the legs and apparently of the intercostal muscles supervened.—See St. Bartholomew Hospital Reports, vol. xv, p. 257. 2541.

It is adherent to the outer surface of the theca, hut does not involve the arachnoid. The tumour was composed almost entirely of cells like those found in specimens of actively growing soft cancer. The corresponding portion of the cord was softened. The man had suffered for eight or nine months from pain in the neck and shoulders, which was attributed to rheumatism. For the last four or five months an alteration in his gait had been observed. The shoulders were elevated, and the neck shortened. For two months he had been unable to wear a collar. One month before his death the limbs and trunk became paralysed. The power of the left arm and leg first failed, and in the course of a few days the paralysis was complete. Urine and fajces passed involuntarily. The immediate cause of death was paralysis of the respiratory muscles. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE SPINAL COED. DILATATION OF CENTRAL, CANAL. 2542. A portion of a Spinal Cord, of which the central canal is so extremely- dilated that the cord is a mere tube of nerve substance. The dilatation was greatest in the cervical region, and gradually diminished, not extending to the lumbar enlargement. The ventricles of the brain were dilated, and contained a large quantity of clear fluid. The membranes of the cord were normal. From a woman, aged 22 years. On her admission to the Hospital there was complete loss of power ami sensation of the left arm, and partial loss of power and sensation of the right arm. There was also partial paralysis of both sides of the face ; she could only speak in an under tone. The lower extremities were not affected. The affection of the left arm had existed two years, and of the right arm six months. She died soon after her admission apparently in an epileptic fit.—See Hope Ward Booh, vol. viii, p. 291, and Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 123. EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION (MYELITIS). 2543. Lower half of a Spinal Cord, the whole substance of which is softened It is surrounded hy a layer of lymph deposited in the tissue of the pia mater. This layer is in parts nearly a quarter of an inch thick; the lymph had a greenish gelatinous aspect, hut is now pale, contracted, and wrinkled. At ono part, the cord is crossed by a narrow band of firm, yellow substance, and its whole natural structui'e here seems to be destroyed. vn. 8 The patient was 12 years old. Nearly six months before death he began to have signs of paralysis of the lower extremities ; and these, in the following five weeks, almost imperceptibly increased, till he had complete loss of sensation and motion in the parts below the umbilicus witli retention of urine and incontinence of faeces. After this time, signs of acute inflamma- tion of the membranes of the spinal cord and of the base of the bruin ensued, from which as well as from his previous symptoms, he for a time partially recovered ; but they returned' and he died with sloughing over the sacrum. Besides the disease shown in the preparation the pia mater at the base of the brain was infiltrated with lymph and pus.

FORMATION OF BULBOUS ENLARGEMENTS AFTER INJURIES OR AM- PUTATIONS. 2563. The Ulnar Nerve and adjacent parts from a man, who had received a severe wound at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the fore-arm, fourteen years before death. The nerve had been completely divided. The upper end of the nerve appears little less than its normal size, and under the microscope showed very little atrophy ; about three-quarters of an inch above the point of division there is a well-marked bulbous enlargement. The lower end of the nerve is much atrophied ; and was found to consist almost entirely of connec- tive tissue, with a few axis-cylinders. The lower end of the nerve is attached to the uuder surface of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris; its upper end to the upper and inner aspect of the same tendon. The two portions of the nerve are not on the same plane, and much scar-tissue intervened between them. There was complete atrophy of all the muscles of the hand supplied by the ulnar nerve, with contraction of the little and ring fingers. Sensation was, however, perfect in the skin supplied by the nerve. See Harley Ward Book, vol. hi, p. 46. 2564. Part of a Humerus, with the several Nerves of. the Arm, from a stump.

The tumour had been growing for nine years ; its removal was easily accomplished, as it shelled out from a distinct capsule. Its structure is that of an ordinary cartilaginous tumour, in which some traces of the lachrymal gland are still evident. The small portion seen below was detached during the operation.—See Ophthalmic Ward Booh, Male, vol. ii, p. 430, and Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxvi, p. 84. SARCOMA. 2574. A large Tumour, and above it a shrunken and flaccid Eye. The tumour nearly filled the orbit, and a part protruded from it the size of a small egg. No portion of the lachrymal gland could be distinguished from the growth, which was of a uniform structure throughout, composed entirely of small round cells embedded in a scanty matrix—presenting, in short, the characters of a round- celled sarcoma. The tumour measures three inches in length by two in breadth. It was of slow growth, extending from its first recognition over a period of nearly two years. Increasing gradually, it distended the conjunctiva before it, and pressed upon the orbit, the sight gradually declining. Death resulted from exhaustion attendant upon old age. IX. 30 The case is reported by Mr. Savory in the Medical Times and Gazette, vol. xxxv, p. 188. EYELIDS. ATROPHY. 2575. The Eyelids, the remains of the Optic Nerve, and the other contents of the Orbit, from which the eye in No. 2625 was removed. The optic nerve ter- minates by a blunt, but not bulbous extremity, which is firmly adherent to the surrounding tissues. The eyelids, muscles, and all the other parts are atrophied and contracted. ix. 20 SYMBLEPHAEON. 2576. An opacity of the lower segment of the Cornea, due to symblepharon after erysipelas. IX< 34 Three months previously the patient had received a violent blow on the temple, which was followed by erysipelas. Since the accident the function of the eye had been wholly lost. She Buffered from frequent attacks of pain in the orbit, and at length the other eye became painful. The lower lid was adherent to the lower part of the cornea. A careful examination of the eye detected no alteration of structure. TUMOURS OF THE EYELTDS. DERMOID CYSTS. 2577. A Dermoid Cyst, removed entire from beneath the orbicularis muscle of 1 child.

The cornea is opaque and infiltrated with pus, and around its margin had ulcerated and given way. The eye was removed with a rapidly-growing orbital tumour, which had displaced the eye until it was no longer covered by the eyelids. There was extreme chemosis with ulceration of the cornea in consequence. Vide No. 2615. ULCERATION. Vide No. 2620. NEURO-PARALYTIC ULCERATION. 2580. A left Eye, in which there is a large ulcerated aperture in the middle of the cornea. The iris, the pupillary margin of which was adherent to this aper- ture, is thickened, and appears ragged, by the lymph deposited upon it. ix. 9 The patient -was 40 years old, and had a tumour in the left side of the pons, which com- pressed the origins of the fifth and facial nerves on the same side. Some signs of this tumour had existed for more than a year. She lost sensation and motion on the left side of the face, and motion in the left arm and leg. The hearing and taste were lost on the left side ; she was subject to repeated attacks of erysipelatous inflammation of the same side of the face : the left side of the interior of the nose was very vascular, and often discharged blood ; finally ulceration of the cornea ensued. The case is related by Mr. Stanley, in the London Medical Gazette, vol. i, p. 531, 1828. LEUCOMA. 2581.

It grew from the outer side of the eye, at the sclero- corneal junction. The tumour was removed soon after its first appearance, but recurrence took place in six months, and it grew rapidly, at times bleeding a good deal. The contents of the globe were throughout normal. Ihe growtti is limited to the cornea and the subconjunctival tissue at the sclero-corneal junction; although closely attached it docs not perforate the cornea. Ine microscope showed that tin; tumour had the characters of a mixed round- and spindle-cell sarcoma.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, Female, vol. i, p. 204. From a woman, aged 60 years. TRANSPLANTATION OF THE CORNEA. 2591. An Eye from which the Cornea was removed by a small cutting trephine. The lens was allowed to escape, and the cornea from another eye was sub- stituted for that removed, and kept in place by three silk sutures. The eye was removed seven days later on account of suppuration. The new cornea was found united to the sclerotic at the inner side, but elsewhere detached and sloughing.—See Ophthalmic Ward Booh, vol. i, p. 230. INJURIES OF THE CORNEA. WOUNDS. 2592. A large irregular Wound of the Cornea, into which the Iris protruded. From the same eye as that preserved in No. 2644. 2593. Left Eye, excised on account of injury produced by a piece of broken china. The wound, which extended across the whole breadth of the cornea, involved the ciliary region at its lower and outer part to the extent of two lines. Considerable protrusion of the iris followed. The cornea became rapidly soft and staphylomatous, vision being quite lost. On extirpation of the globe, its several structures were found to be thickened and firmly matted together by the products of inflammation. The retina was swollen and opaque. Sympathetic ophthalmia followed in the right eye nine weeks after the injury to the left. Vide No. 2651. SCLEROTIC. THICKENING. 2594.

Right Eye, removed from a man, aged 35, on account of sympathetic irritation of the other eye. The eye, which is very large, especially in the antero-posterior diameter, shows a staphyloma of the cornea. There are numerous large equatorial staphylomata between the insertions of the recti muscles, and one or two also in the ciliary region. The cornea is quite opaque.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, Male, vol. ii, p. 24'J. 2597. Numerous Staphylomatous Bulgings of the coats of an Eye.

Staphyloma of the Sclerotic. The choroid has been separated from the sclerotic by fluid; the lamina fusca is much thickened, and condensed, so as to form a distinct cyst wall: the retina is detached, and encloses some shrivelled remains of the vitreous humour; some chalky tissue represents the remains of the lens. The eye was removed from a middle-aged man on account of disfigurement, having been blind from an injury inflicted in childhood. 2600.

TUMOURS OF THE SCLEROTIC. FIBRO-CELLULAE. 2601. The Eye of an Ox, on the anterior part of which is a Tumour with hair growing from it. The tumour, which appeared to be composed of fat and con- densed cellular tissue covered by skin, grew from the outer half of the cornea and sclerotic. The conjunctiva appeared to be lost in the integument which enveloped the tumour. Long hairs, with true bulbs, grew from the skin on . the surface of the tumour. The cornea, where not covered by the diseased growth, was transparent and of its natural thickness and structure : the iris and lens were likewise healthy. ix. 21 IRIS. IRITIS AND ITS EFFECTS. 2602.

Under the microscope a section showed numerous stellate pigment cells. There were visible also delicate fibres and variously shaped cells, some of them with nuclei and nucleoli. Both irides were grey and speckled with irregular patches ot the same brown colour as that of the tumour.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, Female, vol. i, p. 202. 2607. An Eye, showing multiple growths upon and within the iris and ciliary processes. From a little girl, aged 4 years. She had for two years been under treatment on account of disease of the hip-joint; but no change had been observed in the eye until within a few weeks before her admission into the Hospital. Treatment proving of no avail, the eye was removed. Under the microscope the growths appeared to be composed of small nucleated cells with a distinct fibrillated stroma (? tubercle) ; the larger masses containing, in addition, some stellate cells more or less pigmented, and the remains of iris tissues.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, Female, vol. i, p. 240. 2608. The anterior half of an Eye divided by a median vertical section. A white soft rounded growth, about the size of a pea, springs from the lower segment of the iris and projects into the anterior chamber. The pupil is slightly displaced upwards, irregular, and there are tags of adhesion to the capsule of the lens. Pink vessels ramified over the surface of the growth in the recent state. A mass of corresponding size projects backward in the ciliary region: it is internal to the ciliary processes. Microscopic Examination.—The growth consists of small round nuclei in a delicate matrix of connective tissue. It is probably a round-cell sarcoma. From a boy, aged 5 years. The pupil was fixed and did not dilate under atropine. The vision was impaired but not lost. The fundus could not be illuminated. The boy's father observed that he possessed a peculiar liability to suppuration after very slight injuries, as, for instance, a bruise. He had had scarlet fever two months before admission to the Hospital. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 110. CHOROID. CALCAREOUS DEGENERATION, AND FORMATION OF BONE. 2609. Portion of the Eye of a girl, aged 16. The sight of the eye had been lost from inflammation during infancy. The retina has been removed. The choroid coat which has lost its pigment is seen to be dotted with small granules—the so-called colloid degeneration of the elastic membrane of the choroid. These isolated deposits undergo earthy degeneration, and by their coalescence form the plates of bone occasionally met with. 2610. The posterior half of an Eye, removed from a woman, aged 35. It con- tained a shallow cup of bone, rather more than half an inch in diameter and one- eighth of an inch thick. There is a small central opening in the cup through which the detached retina, reduced to a mere fibrous cord, passed. The sight of the eye had been completely lost in consequence of erysipelas in childhood. 2611. Eye of a child, aged 3 years. The eye had been blind since early infancy from the effects of purulent ophthalmia. The entire cornea was opaque. The lens is coated with a thin shell of white earthy material. The vitreous body is much shrunken; the retina has become completely detached from the optic nerve. A small pyramidal piece of bone-like material has been formed at the point of separation, between the retina and choroid. The eye was removed on account of sympathetic iritis in the other eye.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 396 2612. Section of an Eye, which is occupied by a hollow sphere of bone. On the outer surface of this the choroid is still visible; on the inner surface are the flocculent remains of the retina and vitreous humour. ix. 10 2613. A small Eye, containing a complete cup of bone, which lies between the choroid and the retina ; the latter is detached. The lip of the cup is at the ciliary region. Removed from a woman, aged 24 years. The eye became inflamed after vaccination, when she was about two years old, and the sight was destroyed. She stated that there had always been some pain in the eye, but during the last month she had suffered severe pain in the corresponding temporal region; at the same time the opposite eye had become painful and gradually weaker.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, May, 1880. 2614. An Eye, which had been blind many years, the result of an injury, and which had become the seat of intense neuralgic pain. Removed from a man of middle age. The entire globe was much shrunken. The sclerotic was the only coat which retained a natural appearance. The entire contents of the globe have become massed together into a solid ball of earthy and bone-like material. Ai'ound the front of this the remains of the ciliary processes are still apparent. 2615. A degenerated Eyeball, removed on account of sympathetic inflammation in the other eye. The sclerotic has been reflected. The lens is white and of a chalky hardness. Immediately around the entrance of the optic nerve, which is small, there is a plate of bone-like material. Vide Nos. 2595, 2654. CHOROIDAL. HAEMORRHAGE. 2616. The two halves of an Eye, showing extensive effusion of blood between the choroid and sclerotic coats. 2617. Specimen showing hemorrhage into the vitreous, and consequent disloca- tion of the lens into the anterior chamber. The patient was a woman, aged 26. Sclerotomy was performed to relieve tension, the eye being partially disorganised and presenting a well-marked ciliary staphyloma. After tbe operation, increasing pain in the eye necessitated excision on the fifth day. 2618. Intra-ocular Haemorrhage, with detachment of the retina and thinning of the sclerotic, the consequence of choroiditis and progressive myopia. 2619. Intra-occular Haemorrhage. The eye is filled with firm blood-clot divided into two unequal portions by the detached retina. The blood seems to have been poured out between the sclerotic and choroid, as the result of injury. 2620. An Eye, which is filled by a laminated blood-clot. The clot protrudes in a button-like form through the ulcerated cornea. Removed from a woman, aged 61. It was the seat of chronic glaucoma, for which iridec- tomy was performed. The cornea ulcerated, and the protruding blood-clot gave rise to the suspicion of the existence of an intra-ocular tumour. 2621. Intra-ocular Haemorrhage. The choroid and retina are detached from the sclerotic; no trace either of the vitreous humour or of the lens remains. The space between the coats was filled with firm recent blood-clot, a part of which has been removed. The eye, which had been glaucomatous for some months, was removed from a man, aged 56, on account of sudden increase of size and intense pain.DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. TUMOURS OF THE CHOROID. SARCOMA 2622. Section of a Choroidal Tumour found in the eye of a woman, aged 38. The eye had been blind, it was said, in consequence of a blow, for some weeks. Symptoms of glaucoma set in, for which iridectomy was performed, but without permanent benefit. The growth is a firm spindle-celled sarcoma, and appears to have developed from the choroid immediately behind the ciliary region ; it did not contain pigment. 2623. Section of a Tumour, which was removed with the Bye of an adult. The tumour consists of a mass of soft, greyish, medullary substance, some of which is within the globe, but the greater part, having protruded through the sclerotic, has enlarged, and extended round the exterior of the globe. Portions of the choroid membrane and retina may be discerned, apparently unchanged. The retina is reflected over that part of the tumour which is within the globe, indicating that the tumour grew between the retina and choroid. ix. 6 The woman from whom this specimen was taken lived for nineteen years after the operation, and the disease did not return. Part of her skull is No. 2568 in this Series. 2624. Sections of a Tumour, which was removed from the cavity of the orbit with the eye and optic nerve. The tumour adheres to the sclerotic over its entire external surface, the elongated optic nerve passing through its axis. It is lobulated, firm, compact, and of a light yellow colour. The recti muscles unaltered, adhere to it externally. The eye was protruded from the orbit. The tumours have escaped through an ulcerated aperture in the cornea. The sclerotic is natural, but the retina and choroid at the point of section are detached from it, and the space left is occupied by a clot; blood is also effused into the optic nerve. ix.. 12 2625. An Eye, which was removed from a middle-aged man. The tissues of the anterior and inferior third of the eye are occupied by an irregular growth of firm and very vascular substance, with a granulated, warty, and vascular surface. The optic nerve, of which a portion is preserved, is sound. ix. 17 There was no return of disease in the orbit; but the patient died with medullary tumours in the heart, and in some other parts, two years after the extirpation of the eye. His skull is preserved in Series I, No. 78; part of his dura mater in Series XXX, No. 2456; his optic nerve in this Series, No. 2575 ; and his heart in Series VII, No. 1292. 2626. An Eye, with which a large brain-like Tumour is connected. The tumour has protruded to a considerable distance through the eyelids, which it has completely inverted and pushed back into the orbit. Its anterior part is covered with shreds of soft sloughing tissue. The eye is filled with the diseased structure, but the sclerotic is shrivelled and contracted. The optic nerve is sound. ix. 19 The parts were removed after death. The disease had existed for more than two years, and was associated with similar growths in the scalp and bones of the skull. Presented by Martin Ware, Esq. 2627. The extirpated contents of an Orbit. The position of the diseased eyeball may be recognized by that of the optic nerve, and of a funnel-shaped cavity lined with a brownish membrane, the remains of the choroid. The globe is occupied by a new growth, which has protruded through the sclerotic. ix 27 The patient was 25 years old. The "disease had existed nine months. After several months' duration, the eye began to protrude, and the protrusion constantly increased, completely evertin" the conjunctiva and producing extreme suffering. The patient remained well for at least two years and a half after the extirpation.398 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 2628. Anteroposterior section of an Eye completely filled by a pink, tolerably firm, fleshy growth, which protrudes through the anterior part. The growth appears to be enclosed by the remains of the choroid. Its microscopic characters are those of a spindle-cell sarcoma. From a man, aged 38, who in infancy lost the sight of the eye from purulent ophthalmia. He first noticed the growth nine months before his admission to the Hospital, and was then obliged to desist from wearing an artificial eye. The eye had apparently not grown since childhood. MELANOTIC SARCOMA. 2629. Sections of an Eye, of which the Globe is almost completely filled by a mass of medullary and melanotic substance. The diseased growth appears to have originated between the choroid membrane and the retina. The former still surrounds it; the latter, entire but pressed to one side of the eye, is exhibited in the upper part of the preparation. The lens is pressed forwards into contact with the inner surface of the cornea; the iris forms a narrow ring around its margin. At the back of the preparation are two considerable staphylomatous projections of the sclerotic, which, before the removal of the eye, were observable at the lower and outer part of the front of the globe. ix. 18 The patient was a girl, 20 years old. The disease had existed more than six months, and for three months its progress had been attended by extreme pain. She remained well for three years after the operation. Then, melanotic disease was developed in the liver, heart, and many other parts ; but the disease did not return in the orbit. A portion of her heart is in Series VII, No. 1290 ; and her pancreas in Series XXIII, No. 2270. The case is related by Sir Wm. Lawrence in a Clinical Lecture in the London Medical Gazette, vol. xxxvi, p. 961. London, 1845. 2630. Melanotic Sarcoma of Choroid. The posterior half of the eye is shown. The lower and inner thirds of the cavity of the globe are occupied by a melanotic mass which springs from the choroid. The upper and outer third of the choroid is healthy. The retina was detached, and lay in the anterior half of the globe. On the inner side the growth has passed through the sclerotic. The tumour shown, which lay in the apex of the orbit, was connected with this outgrowth ; the optic nerve is imbedded in its outer side. The patient was a collier, aged 54 years. 2631. Melanotic Sarcoma of the Choroid. The entire globe is filled with a densely black growth, which has destroyed almost every trace of the normal structures. The growth has made its way through the coats of the eye at their posterior aspect, and the orbit was filled by a similar morbid material. The eye was removed from a man, aged 25. It had become blind soon after an injury in very early life, but had only become enlarged and painful about six months previous to*the operation. 2632. Sections of an Eye, which is filled by a soft medullary and melanotic substance, of mingled shades of dusky grey and black, which has also protruded through the back part of the sclerotic, forming a nodulated elevation by the side of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is reduced in size, but appears otherwise sound : the lens and iris are pressed against the cornea. ix. 8 The patient was a man, 30 years old, and the disease had been about two years in progress : the globe was slightly enlarged by the growth within it. A year after the extirpation of the eye, the patient was in good health. The case is related by Sir Wm. Lawrence in his " Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye." London, 1844, 8vo, p. 719. 2633. Sections of an Eye, with its Globe nearly filled by a medullary and melanotic growth, which also protrudes through the upper and anterior part of the sclerotic, and forms, externally to the eye, a mass larger than the eye itself. The part of the tumour within the eye is nearly black : that, which is'externalDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. to it, is while and variously shaded with grey and black. The brain of the same individual is preserved in Series XXX, No. 2498. ix. 16 2634. An Eye filled with soft melanotic sarcoma. A large nodnlar mass of the growth has protruded through and overgrown the cornea and the anteroinferior part of the sclerotic. Most of the tissues of the eye are involved m the disease, but it appears to have had its primary seat in the choroid. ix. *8 2635. The Eye of a man, aged 40, showing a melanotic sarcoma, which had penetrated through the posterior part of the globe into the orbit. It commenced, and was recognised with the ophthalmoscope, about a year before its removal, as a growth from the choroid—See Ophthalmic Ward Bool, Male, vol. iii, p. 84. 2636. A Melanotic Sarcoma of the Choroid, which protruded through the posterior surface of the globe into the orbit.—See Ophthalmic Ward Book, Female, vol. iii, p. 314. 2637. Sarcoma of the Choroid. A tumour springs from the choroid on the inner side of the disc. The retina, extremely thinned, can be traced over its surface. The tumour was found on microscopic examination to be composed chiefly of round cells, with, in places, an admixture of spindle-cells. Most of the cells contained pigment. The eye was removed from a man, aged 63. 2638. Sections of a mass of Melanotic Sarcoma removed from a man's orbit. The remains of the eye were included in the mass, but the growths within and without the globe are so confused that none of its parts can be now discerned. The lower part of each section is covered with the everted and partially ulce- rated palpebral conjunctiva. IX. 29 The patient was 44 years old. This disease had been in progress for about eight months, but the eye had been atrophied for nearly twelve years previously, in consequence of acute inflam- mation after injury. The disease completely filled and protruded from the orbit. It was freely removed, but in two months it recurred, and five months afterwards proved fatal. No. 394 is a drawing of the specimen in its recent state. 2639. Sections of a large lobulated Tumour, which was removed from the cavity of the left orbit of an adult; and a portion of Brain, from the same individual. To the upper part of the sections of the tumour is attached the posterior half of the eyeball : this is filled by a substance similar to that of the tumour, so that it may be assumed that the tumour began to grow within the eye and pro- truded through its anterior part. The tumour is, throughout, soft and brain- like in its texture ; parts of it are nearly white, and parts are intensely black. It appears also to have been very vascular. In the lower part of the bottle is a portion of the tumour which was extracted from the back part of the orbit: it consists of the same substance as that already described. The optic nerves are connected with the portion of brain; the left nerve has some of the medullary and melanotic substance attached to it: it is reduced in size as far as the com- missure ; but beyond this, no change is visible in it. rx. 7 The patient was an unhealthy man, 65 years old. The disease had existed about twelve months. He died ten days after the extirpation of the eye ; and melanotic disease was found in the liver, sections of which are preserved in Series XXI, No. 2212. The case is related by Sir Win, Lawrence in his " Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye." London, 1844, 8vo, p. 720. LENS. DISLOCATION. 2640. An Eyeball, which was removed on account of severe pain.

The lens has disappeared ; the anterior chamber contains pus. When the section of the globe was made a large quantity of pus escaped from the vitreous. Kemovcd from a boy, aged 11, ten days after a blow with a stone. 2646. The half of an Eye. The entire contents of the globe had become con- verted into one uniform mass of cheesy consistence. A layer of the substance lines the anterior chamber. A dark line running across the eye seems to mark the situation of the choroid and retina, which have been detached and driven forwards. Posteriorly it is hard to define the sclerotic, it being so blended with the contents of the globe. From a girl, whose eye became blind during convalescence after measles. 2647. The Eye of a man, which had been blind for many years after prolonged inflammation. The vitreous humour is solid and shrivelled into a nodulated mass of firm earthy material. The retina is m situ, and seems to be rendered opaque and irregularly thickened by a similar material. The choroid is in a similar condition. Probably the result of suppuration. 2648. A shrunken Eye from a boy. The lens formed a round mass of degene- rated tissue, of cartilaginous hardness. The place of the vitreous humour is taken by dense white fibrous tissue, with soft yellowish patches here and there. The choroid is in its proper position, but no trace of retina could be found. The sclerotic is much thickened and crumpled posteriorly, but is otherwise normal.401 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. —See Hospital Reports, vol. vii, p. 181; Ophthalmic Ward Boole, Male, vol. i, p. 250. HYDATID IN THE VITREOUS HUMOUR. 2649. The half of an Eye, removed from a man, aged 45, which had been blind for some years, and very painful at intervals. The posterior half of vitreous cavity was occupied by a cyst with a very firm thick wall, the contents of which had undergone suppuration. Floating in the pus was a hydatid. The choroid is in situ; there are no traces of retina or vitreous humour, but the cavity of the globe anterior to the cyst contained flocculent shreddy material, in all probability made up of remains of vitreous and detached retina. The cyst walls are very thick, and when cut were as firm as layers of cartilage. They were composed of firm fibrous tissue. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE GLOBE. 2650. An Eye, containing a gun-cap, removed from a girl who was employed in cartridge making. The foreign body entered the globe at the outer and upper part of the sclero-comeal junction. The cap lies in the midst of broken-down blood- clot and detached retina. The eye was quite blind and intensely painful. The larger wound in the sclerotic was made after the eye was removed. 2651. An Eye, showing a fragment of metal lodged between the retina and choroid, about a quarter of an inch above the optic disc. A white speck on the cornea shows where the foreign body had entered the eye.—See Ophthalmic Ward Booh, Male, vol. iv, p. 68. RETINA. RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA. 2652. An Eye, removed from a middle-aged woman, which had been blind for a long period, and had of late become extremely painful. Before removal there was a large equatorial staphyloma. Around the equator of the fundus is a band of pigmented retina (Retinitis pigmentosa) one-fifth of an inch in breadth. With a lens the pigment appeared to be situated in the substance of the retina in the form of a network of caudate cells. Corresponding to this portion of the retina, the pigmentation of the choroid was disturbed, and appeared as if it were honeycombed. The choroid was closely attached to the retina every- where, without any effusion between them.—See Ophthalmic Ward Boole, Female, vol. iii, pp. 179 and 429. 2653. The posterior half of an Eye, showing general atrophy of the cornea, and deposit of pigment in the retina. From a woman, aged 50 years. The eye had long been blind and was removed on account of pain. DETACHMENT OF THE RETINA. 2654. Section of an Eye, which shows complete detachment of the retina. The lens is shrivelled up and calcareous. A layer of bone is developed between the choroid and retina. 2655. Complete detachment of the Retina from effusion between it and the choroid, the result of an injury four years previously. Removed from a man, aged 45 years. 2656. Complete detachment of the Retina. The retina is contracted into a yellow, opaque, pyramidal-shaped mass, containing the remains of the vitreous humour. The sclerotic is very remarkably thickened. The eye was removed from a child, who had become blind after purulent ophthalmia 2 D402 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 2657. Complete detachment of the Retina. The sight of the eye was lost by an injury fifteen years before its removal, which was rendered necessary by severe pain. 2658. An Eye, in which the Cornea is very small and opaque. The lens and vitreous humour have entirely disappeared. The choroid is thickened; and the retina, collapsed, forms a cord extending from the entrance of the optic nerve to the surface of an irregular mass of tissue which occupies the former situation of the lens. ix. 2 2659. Detachment of the Retina. This structure has been completely de- tached in the form of a funnel, by effusion between it and the choroid. The choroid itself is opaque, and its pigmentary layer is atrophied in places, the result of long standing inflammation. The eye had been blind for some years. It was not itself the seat of pain, but was removed on account of sympathetic inflammation of the other eye. 2660. Complete detachment of the Retina by extravasation of blood between it and the choroid. The detachment is complete. The surface of the membrane is covered with tawny-coloured material, probably old decolorised blood-clot. The choroid is dotted here and there with small white patches the results of inflammation. No history could be obtained, but the eye, which was much enlarged, had suddenly become very tense and painful. 2661. A similar specimen. The eye had been treated for some months for chronic iritis, when it was accidentally injured by a blow. It was removed soon after on account of severe pain. The patient was a man, aged 39 years. 2662. Partial Detachment of the Retina. This structure has become detached from the choroid coat for three-fourths of its extent; while immediately around the entrance of the optic nerve the two coats are fastened to each other by tough fibrous adhesions. The eye had been blind for some years; it was removed from a woman, aged 45, who had suffered from secondary syphilis. The other eye was much impaired by old iritis and choroiditis. TUMOURS OF THE RETINA. 2663. Glioma of the Retina. The globe is completely filled with a soft white spongy-looking growth which contains many gritty particles—the results of calcareous degeneration. The posterior part of the globe is surrounded by a similar formation which, however, has suffered no appreciable degeneration. No trace of the natural structures within the eye remains. Under the micro- scope the tumour was found to consist almost entirely of nucleated cells, of uniform size, without inter-cellular stroma, but with many new blood-vessels ramifying amongst them. The small earthy particles consist of carbonate of lime. From a child, aged 2\. The growth had been observed for seven months before its removal. Presented by B. J. Vernon, Esq. 2664. The Eye and Optic Nerve of a child, about 4 years old. The globe of the eye is completely filled with a soft glioma. The lens is pushed forwards into contact with the cornea. The optic nerve is, in its whole length, surrounded by the growth, and at the commissure, a larger mass was imbedded in the base of the brain. ix. 26DISEASES- AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 2665. Glioma of the Retina around the termination of the optic nerve, and im- plicating the optic nerve itself for a considerable distance. From a child. 2666. Section of a Tumour, which filled the orbital cavity of a young subject. The tumour is a soft glioma, containing patches of extravasated blood. The eye and optic nerve are imbedded in the centre of tumour, and are themselves so filled with the new-growth that no portion of the natural structure of the eye, except the sclerotic, can be distinguished. IX- 4 2666a. A Glioma of the Retina. A vertical section through the optic nerve and eye-ball shows a firm lobular growth of a white colour, commencing at the entrance of the optic nerve, and filling the greater portion of the inferior two-thirds of the vitreous chamber, the remaining third being filled with recent flocculent lymph. The growth consists of two lobes, in distinct portions, the smaller and posterior of these, springing from the entrance of the optic nerve, has driven the choroid before it, and perforating this has spread out into the vitreous chamber as far as the posterior aspect of the lens. No trace of the retina remains. The lens was in its normal position, but has been lost. The eye was removed from a boy, aged 10, and the disease had not attracted attention until seven weeks previous to the operation. 2667. An Eye, from which all the natural structures have disappeared, giving place to a mass of whitish medullary matter. The recti muscles are connected with the upper part of this mass. ix. 5 Vide No. 3297 in Series L. OPTIC NERVE. ATROPHY. Vide Series XXXII, Nos. 2551 to 2554, and Series L, No. 3218.

An external Ear, the seat of a large growth of epithelioma.^ The disease occnpies the whole thickness of more than half the auricle, projecting alike on its external and internal surfaces, and leaving only its upper and anterior borders and the lobule free. It forms a flat, lobed, and fissured growth, the overhanging margins of which are, in parts, sinuous, and have everted the adjacent skin of the auricle. The middle of the posterior border of the auricle is,'with part of the cancer, completely destroyed by ulceration. The general texture of the cancer is soft, shreddy, and very vascular; the microscopic structure was well marked, according to the type of epithelioma. x. 8 A small superficial ulcer, with a scab, had existed on the outer surface of the ear for six years, the scab being frequently detached and removed. The growth here shown had been m progress of increase and ulceration for six months before it was removed. The patient was a strong man, 76 years old. # # # # * * * * 2671.

At the junction of the posterior surface of the petrous with the mastoid bone there is a small opening-, marked by a piece of wire, through which pus passed from the mastoid cells to the under surface of the dura mater, where a small collection was found. An abscess was also found in the right half of the cerebellum, and the right lateral sinus contained a thrombus. From a girl aged 16 years, who was attacked with ear-ache and otorrhcea seven days before her death, which took place from meningitis. A year before she had a similar attack ot ear- ache, which was relieved by a profuse discharge of pus from the ear.—See Rope Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 455. CARIES OF THE TEMPORAL BONE. 2677. A Temporal Bone, in which ulceration has extended from the meatus auditorius externus, through the greater part of the base of the petrous portion of the bone, and has destroyed nearly all the cavity of the internal ear. x. 2 2678. Portion of the left Temporal Bone of a young man. A section has been made along the meatus auditorius externus, and through the cavity of the tympanum. The membrana tympani is very much thickened, and there is an ulcerated aperture near its anterior margin, through which a bristle is passed into the cavity of the tympauum. Another bristle is passed through a passage formed by ulceration, which leads from the tympanum to the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and is thence continued through an aperture in the adjacent part of the squamous portion. x. 5 The patient had purulent discharge from the ear for many years. Two days before his death, after having long suffered from intense headache, he was suddenly affected by paralysis of the right leg ; then of the right hand ; and he gradually became comatose. Pus was found in the cavity of the cerebral arachnoid j and the longitudinal, lateral, and petrosal sinuses were full of lymph and pus. 2679. Portions of two Temporal Bones. The right tympanic cavity is laid open, and a bristle is passed into a mass of firm, originally whitish, tubercular matter, which is adherent to the outer wall. A similar, though originally softer, material, completely fills the left tympanic cavity; over this the bone had perished, as seen in the preparation. The softened deposit escaped externally, partly through a small opening in the membrana tympani, and partly through a passage formed in the bone just above the mastoid, process. The outer table of the temporal bone is rough in consequence of an extensive exfoliation of the superficial layer. See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xii, p. 53. Vide Nos. 2676 and 2684.

HYPERTROPHIES. CORNS (Clavus). 2687. The Second Toe from each Foot. On the anterior extremity of one there is a large corn. Over the interphalangeal joint of the other there is a corn, and beneath this a bursa. The extensor tendon of these toes was contracted, and had long drawn them up, so that the anterior extremity of the one, and the articulation of the other, were subject to greatly increased pressure. They caused, in their deformed condition, so much pain, that they were amputated. 2688. Portion of a Foot, upon which there are two corns. The cuticle has been separated. In each corn the cuticle is thick and horny ; and from one of them a short horny growth projects outwards. The cutis beneath the corns is thickened and very vascular. xi. 21 2689. Section of a Foot, upon which a corn was situated over the ball of the great toe. The cuticle is removed to show that the disease is confined to a thickening of that part. The cutis beneath the corn is natural, except that its vascularity is increased, and its surf ace impressed. xi. 4 ICTHYOSIS. 2690. Horny epidermal masses from a case of Icthyosis Cornea.

Section of a Leg, in which the integument of the sides of the foot and the back of the leg was extensively affected with keloid. The diseased integument is gradually raised from one quarter to half an inch above the surrounding healthy level, and presents a tuberculated surface. Its outline is irregular, and about its borders, which are smooth and shelving, are a few small, scattered nodules. A section through the diseased structure shows that the change consists in circumscribed thickening and induration of the integu- ment, with production of very tough and compact fibrous tissue. The surface of the nodules is highly vascular, and, in some parts, ulcerated. The other structures of the leg appear healthy. Tbe other section of the leg is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. Nos. 403, 404, are drawings of the leg taken during life. xi. 38 The patient was 25 years old. The disease followed scalding with hot oil. The scalded parts were not healed till seven months after the injury. The scars began to "grow up" about a month after their completion; eight months afterwards the limb was amputated. 2697. A small Keloid, removed from the inner surface of the thigh, four inches below Poupart's ligament. It grew from the scar of a scald, and had been noticed six months. The patient was a child, aged 11 years.—See Lucas Ward Boole, vol. vii, p. 73. 2698. A similar enlarged and indurated Cicatrix, formed after the healing of a burn on the back of a young girl.

Portion of Integument removed from over the upper dorsal part of the spine. It presents a nearly circular ulcer, with somewhat sinuous margins, and between two and three inches in diameter. The surface of the ulcer is unequal, and covered with granulations, which, during life, were pale and rusty-pink, firm to the touch, and, in parts, warty. Its base is firm, its borders slightly raised ; the tissues beneath it, even to the depth of the trapezius muscle and the vertebral spines, were indurated and confused. On microscopic examination, the diseased parts showed no signs of cancerous structure, but the constituents of ordinary granulations and thickened connective tissue. xi. 39 The patient was a cook, 40 years old. The disease was of ten years' duration, and had been variously treated without any advantage. The wound of tbe operation did not completely heal; and two years afterwards, ulceration similar to that which is here shown bad reached a yet greater extent. VASCULAR GROWTHS—N-ffiVI, &c. 2721.

Its surface is covered by an irregular warty growth, which had existed from birth, and during life appeared very vascular, and like a narvus. XI. 12 2723. Portion of Skin removed from the posterior and lower part of the trunk of a middle-aged woman. A large portion of skin, originally occupied by a naevus, has undergone the following changes. It presents an irregular warty surface, composed of a multitude of densely-set, lobulated growths, which are for the most part elevated on narrow pedicles. The whole are covered by a thiu layer of dark cuticle, detached portions of which fill up in great measure the interspaces between the several growths. About the centre of the portion of skin, there is a pendulous tumour, of the same characters as the others, but of much larger size. They are all composed of a dense cellular tissue, similar to that of the corium. xi. 23 Presented by William Taylor, Esq. 2724. Right lower extremity of an infant, aged 10 months. The texture of the cutis is natural over the buttock, but uniformly thickened over the thigh, while on the leg and foot it is very much hypertrophied, condensed, and studded with numerous knots and tubercles. The subcutaneous tissue is greatly increased, being from one to two inches thick about the calf and upper part of the back of the thigh. It is everywhere occupied by a dense, reticulate, spongy, venous tissue of a cavernous character; there are but few venous trunks to be seen, but everywhere a structure like erectile tissue, very elastic, and which contracted on section. In the subcutaneous tissue of the foot, leg, and lower part of the thigh, the meshes of this cavernous texture are very fine and close. Towards the back of the upper part of the thigh, where it joins the buttock, the reticular and cavernous spaces are of much larger dimensions, some being as large as the end of one's thumb. The intermuscular connective tissue is everywhere occupied by the same cavernous structure. Similar tissue was found on the right side within the pelvis, extending into the loins behind the right kidney. The muscles are healthy and of normal size.

They lay loose in the cavity of the cyst, with its softened contents mixed with pus. xxxv. 62 The cyst was, probably, congenital; but was not noticed till six weeks after birth. The structures of its walls were disordered by chronic inflammation, which had also led to the formation of a sinus into its cavity. The patient a woman, 30 years old, recovered quickly after the removal of the cyst. Vide also Nos. 3369 and 3370 in Series L. MOLLT7SCUM CONTAGrlOSTJM. 2731.

HYDROCELE OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. 2735. The Tunica Vaginalis and Spermatic Vessels from a case of Hydrocele. In consequence of an unequal yielding of the tunica vaginalis, there is a dis- tinct prominence of the swelling at its lower part. The testicle is situated at the lower and back part of the sac, just above this prominent part. xxviii. 5 2736. A Hydrocele. The blood-vessels of the tunica vaginalis and testicle are injected.

The tunica vaginalis, laid open by a section carried through the testicle from behind, is thickened and enlarged. Its cavity was filled with fluid blood; and irregular masses of solid blood- stained fibrinous substance adhere to its internal surface. The testicle appears healthy. xxviii. 44 2746. A Testicle and Tunica Vaginalis from a case of Hematocele. The tunica vaginalis is much thickened and numerous ulcers, most of them small and " punched out," are thickly scattered over both the visceral and parietal surfaces. An ulcer of considerable extent is seen at the inferior extremity of the testis. The tunica vaginalis was filled with grumous sanguineous fluid. No trace of tubercle was found at the base of the ulcers on examination with the microscope. Removed from a man, aged 31 years. Ten days before his admission to the Hospital his left testicle became suddenly tender, and increased rapidly in size ; it had been more or less swollen for two years. On admission, the scrotal tumour was as large as a cricket ball, semi- fluctuating, and not translucent.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 114. 2747.

Adhesion of the two layers. 2749. Sections of a Testicle, with the cavity of the tunica vaginalis obliterated by layers of false membrane a third of an inch in thickness, and very tough and compact. At the posterior part, by the side of the epididymis, earthy matter has been deposited in the midst of the new tissue. The substance of the testicle is soft, but not otherwise diseased ; it is of natural size, but the epididymis is enlarged and indurated. All the tissues around the tunica vaginalis appeared thickened, adherent, and hard, and, together with the thick layer of false membrane, gave the characters of a considerable enlargement of the testicle itself. xxviii. 56 The other testicle was similarly affected, but to a slighter extent. 2750. A Testicle, showing complete adhesion of the layers of the tunica vaginalis to each other. 2751. Two Testicles. Upon the upper part of each there is a cyst of globular form, which was filled by a watery fluid. It is probable that this cyst was formed between the layers of the tunica vaginalis, which, in the rest of their extent, are adherent. The structure of the testicles themselves is healthy. xxviii. 52 For other Specimens of Adhesion of the Layers of the Tunica Vaginalis, vide Nos. 2760, 2814, 2816. b. Suppuration in the Cavity of the Tunica Vaginalis. 2752. A Tunica Vaginalis greatly enlarged, tough, and thickened to the extent of one to three lines; its internal surface is very vascular ; and its cavity was filled with pus. The testicle is enlarged and indurated. xxviii. 8 2753. A Testicle and Tunica "Vaginalis laid open. The cavity of the tunica vaginalis, which had probably been the seat of an old haematocele, was found filled with pus. The tunica vaginalis is dense and thickened by layers ofDISEASES OP THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 415 fibrous tissue, and in one place presents the appearance of fibro-cartilage. The testicle appears normal. The specimen was taken from the body of an old man, who died of senile gangrene of the leg, with bronchitis. He had complained of pain in the testicle only a few days before death. Presented by Mr. P. S. Eve. LOOSE BODIES IN THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. 2754. A flattened Calcareous Body about the size of a pea. It was found loose m the cavity of the tunica vaginalis of a middle-aged man. On one of the sur- faces is a small tubercle, apparently the point of attachment of a pedicle ; and a small fibrous nodule was found on the surface of the testis, close to the head of the epididymis, which was probably the base of the pedicle.

A Testicle, reduced to half its natural size, in consequence of the pressure of a hydrocele iu the opposite side of the scrotum. The body of the testicle is much more atrophied than the epididymis. xxvm. 25 2757. The Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa Deferentia, with an undeveloped testicle, from an adult. The two vesiculee are of the same size, and they both contained the usual brownish fluid.

The right Testicle, very ill-developed, of a man, aged 22 years, who, during life, was of feeble intellect, and subject to epileptic fits. The medulla oblongata was small and unsymmetrical, and after death, clots, evidently old formations, were found in the longitudinal sinus and pulmonary arteries. 2759. The Testicles of an adult, which had been retained within the inguinal canal. Both the glands are much smaller than natural, and with one of them a peritoneal sac is connected. XVII. 54 EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLE. 2760. A Testicle, exhibiting the effects of acute inflammation in its interior. Several irregular cavities extend through the interior of the testicle, which were filled by pus and lymph. The pus has escaped, but portions of the lymph remain. The glandular tissue around these cavities is consolidated. A small quantity of transparent fluid was found in the sac of the tunica vaginalis, and there were partial adhesions between its opposite surfaces. At one part, the tunica albuginea is thin and irregular on its surface, as if yielding to the enlargement of the testicle. xxvm. 55 Prom a man, on whom the operation of lithotrity had been performed. The disease of the testicle commenced a week after the operation, and nearly a week before the patient's death. A portion of the broken calculus had previously become fixed in the urethra. The bladder No. 2398, in Series XXIX, was taken from the same patient. 2761. A Testicle and its membranes divided by a longitudiual section. The testicle, which is seen above, was easily turned out from its membranes. Its structure appears to be but slightly altered, beyond being infiltrated with inflammatory deposit. The membranes are altogether much thickened and otherwise altered, apparently by chronic inflammation. xxvin. 66 From a man, aged 31. The disease had existed about five months.416 DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 2762. A Testicle and Spermatic Cord. In the centre of the testicle there is an irregularly circumscribed abscess, from which a fistulous passage (into which a portion of glass is introduced), extends through the tunics of the testicle and scrotum. The substance of the testicle around the abscess is indurated. xxviii. 45 2763. A Testicle, removed from a man, aged 52 years. It had been enlarged for nine years. The bulk of its substance has disappeai'ed; its place being supplied by a dense, firm, though friable mass of fibrous tissue. The tunica vaginalis has been converted into a thick-walled cyst, the interior of which was covered with rough lymph, and apparently old blood-clots. Above the mass was a smaller, though similar cyst. PROTRUSION OF THE TESTICLE THROUGH ITS ULCERATED COVER- INGS (Fungus Testis). 2764. A Testicle, with a portion of the Scrotum. The testicle, and a mass of soft fungous, and vascular granulations from its anterior surface, are protruded through an ulcerated aperture in the scrotum. What remains of the natural structure of the testicle is imbedded in the back part of the protruded mass. xxviii. 21 2765. A Testicle, with a portion of the Scrotum. The testicle, covered on its anterior part by a layer of granulations, is protruded through an ulcerated aperture in its tunics, and the scrotum. A section of the protruded testicle shows that its glandular tissue is but little altered; but the epididymis appears indurated and consolidated with the adjacent tissues. xxviii. 27 2766. A Testicle, with a portion of the Scrotum. The testicle, enlarged, in- durated, and exhibiting appearances of caseous material deposited in it, is pro- truded through an ulcerated aperture in its tunics and the scrotum. The protruded surface is thinly covered by granulations; the posterior part appears healthy. xxviii. 35 2767. A Testicle affected with strumous disease. Large fungous granulations project through the scrotum. xxviii. 64 2768. A similar specimen. xxviii. 65 2769. A Testicle, from a child, 7 years old, enlarged and indurated.

Portion of a Testicle, apparently unaltered in structure, but covered by granulations, which protruded through an ulcerated aperture in its tunics and the scrotum ; it was removed by operation. xxviii. 29 Vide No. 2781. SYPHILITIC DISEASE OF THE TESTICLE. 2771. A left Testicle injected. The surface of the anterior and lower part of the testicle is irregular and nodular, and the black discoloured patch formed the base of a serpiginous ulcer of the scrotum, through which the testicle slightly protruded. The organ is occupied by large yellowish-white nodules or gummata, of a tough, fibrous, non-vascular material. Two of the smaller gum- mata are distinct, the remainder have coalesced into a mass, which occupies the anterior portion of the organ. A loose fibroid tissue, which is very vascular and of a pink colour, due to the injection, surrounds and separates the nodules. The epididymis is lost in the general substance of the testicle. The disease was probably syphilitic ; microscopic examination showed that the nodules consisted of a firm, indistinct, fibroid tissue, in which no trace of the tubuli seminiferi could be found. Towards the edge of the nodules theDISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 417 fibroid tissue was looser, and contained numerous small round cells, while at the junction of the vascular and non-vascular structures the round cells were very abundant and enclosed in the meshes of a loose reticulum of connective tissue. The inter-nodular structure was composed of a loose fibrous tissue, very vascular, and enclosing at wide intervals tubes containing caseous material, which appeared to be contracted seminiferous tubes. From a man, aged 35 years. Four years before his admission to the Hospital the testicle became swollen, but subsequently regained its normal size : two years later it again became swollen, gradually increasing in size, and finally an ulcer formed, which exposed the testicle. There was no conclusive evidence of syphilis, but ho appeared to have had a node on the sternum.—See Henri/ Ward Book, toI. vi, p. 270. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 119. 2772. Sections of a Testicle. The organ is but little altered either in shape or size. Its external surface is uniformly smooth, firm, and inelastic to the touch. The epididymis is scarcely, if at all, affected. The parenchyma of the body of the testicle has been completely replaced by a dense, tough, yellowish-white material, like old inflammatory lymph. This under the microscope is seen to consist of fine granules and of oil-globules of various sizes, with no trace of fibrillation, and only faint vestiges here and there of cell-formation. The specimen was taken from the body of a middle-aged man brought to the Hospital for dissection. No history of the case could be obtained ; but numerous scars, like those the result of syphilitic ulceration, were seen on various parts of the body. The opposite testis was similarly affected, but to a somewhat less extent. TUBERCULAR DISEASE OP THE TESTICLE AND EPIDIDYMIS. 2773. Two Testicles. One of them is enlarged to about twice its natural size; and pale yellow, soft caseous matter is almost uniformly diffused through its substance, leaving scarcely any intervening portions of the glandular tissue. In the other testicle are several distinct and circumscribed deposits of caseous matter at its lower part, and in the epididymis. xxvili. 32 From a man, 30 years old. The enlargement of the testicle had been observed many years. He died with tubercular disease of the prostate, lungs, and other organs. 2774. Sections of a Testicle, enlarged, indurated, and in many parts infiltrated with caseous matter. The part which is not filled by caseous matter is white and tough, like the tissue of a cicatrix. The caseous matter is in circumscribed masses of irregular shape, compact, and of a pale yellowish-white colour, which project above the surface of the substance in which they are deposited. Above the testicle there is a mass of similar indurated tissue with caseous deposit, situated either in the spermatic cord or in the upper part of the epididymis. x.wiii. 20 The patient was a gentleman, 42 years old. The testicle had been enlarging for seven years. Shortly before its removal the disease appeared to extend rapidly up the spermatic cord and some enlargement was observed in the opposite epididymis. 2775. Two Testicles enlarged, and having circumscribed deposits of caseous matter in their interior, and in that of each epididymis. xxvni. 38 2776. A Testicle affected with Tubercular Disease. The organ is uniformly en- larged, and the posterior portion is occupied by a uniform yellowish substance • but towards the anterior part the tissue of the testicle can be discerned studded with yellow spots of caseous material. The epididymis is enlarged, and also contains caseous matter. From a man, aged 21 years. Six weeks before admission to the Hospital he found the testicle to be increasing in size, and he suffered some pain in it. In a fortnight the organ reached its present size. The enlargement was uniform, firm, and elastic. Before removal the disease was thought to be malignant. The nature of the disease was verified bv micro- scopic examination.—See Barker Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 92. 2 E418 DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 2777. The left Testicle removed from a man, aged 40. It is divided by a longi- tudinal section. The whole interior is filled by a deposit of caseous matter; scarcely a trace of the natural structure of the testis is visible. The testis had been enlarged for eight months. The right epididymis was also considerably increased in size. XXVI1L b/ 2778. Sections of two Testicles. In one testicle the place of the natural struc- ture is entirely occupied by large masses of caseous matter. In the other, a small portion of the natural structure remains around a mass of caseous matter. Ulceration of the skin and of the tunics of one testicle had taken place, allowing the protrusion of the morbid substance. xxviii. 50 Both testicles were removed at the same time from a man, 40 years old. 2779. A Testicle, exhibiting a circumscribed mass of caseous matter m its centre. The adjacent part of the testicle appears healthy, and the morbid deposit has produced no enlargement. The other testicle was siimlarly diseased^ 2780. A Testicle affected with Tubercular Disease. The epididymis is filled with caseous matter, which has broken down into an abscess. A caseous mass occupied also the mediastinum testis. Numerous miliary tubercles could in the recent state be distinguished, scattered through the substance of the testicle. They were abundant near the mediastinum, but few near the surtace ot the testicle. The disease was of four months' duration, and occurred in a man, aged 41 years; the exciting cause was unknown. 2781. A similar specimen. A mass of caseous matter occupies the globus minor It has a circular outline and a deeply crenated edge. The testicle itself appears healthy. A portion of the gland protrudes through an ulcer of the scrotum. The patient from whom the testicle was removed had contracted gonorrhoea a.year before admission into the Hospital; and the affection of the testicle dated from a short time after this attack. 2782. A Testicle, exhibiting distinct and circumscribed deposits of caseous matter in the epididymis. The vas deferens is obliterated and contracted The body of the testicle appears healthy. xxviii. 66 TUMOURS OF THE TESTICLE. ENCHONDROMATA. . 2783. An Enchondroma of the Testicle. The cartilage is arranged m tortuous columns, which, in a transverse section, have the appearance of nodules, the centre of most of the columns contains a yellow opaque material, by the removal of which a central canal is formed in some instances. The columns are separated by a small amount of connective tissue. The epididymis is also converted into a mass of cartilage. No trace of normal gland tissue exists in the organ. From a man, aged 22 years, who first noticed that the testicle was enlarged four years before its removal- during the last year it remained stationary. The testicle was extremely hard, except at one point above and behind : this was found to be occupied by a cyst and some unaltered gland tissue. No return of the disease had taken place five years alter the operation. —See Abernethy Ward Book, vol. iii, p. 153. 2784. Section of a Mass occupying the place of a Testis from a man, aged 37 years. The lower portion is composed of tortuous, cylmdriform pieces otDISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 419 cartilage, which are closely packed and imbedded in a tough filamentous white connective tissue. Over parts of the outer surface of the mass, a layer of seminal tubes is thickly spread out between it and the tunica albuginea. Sur- mounting this, and separated from it by a layer of connective tissue, is a conical mass formed of similar but smaller pieces of cartilage. xxviii. 68 2785. A branching Cartilaginous Growth which projected from a lymphatic into the cavity of the vena cava inferior. The coats of the vein, which had undergone no change in their structure, were reflected on its narrow base, but, gradually thinning, were lost on many of its branches, which thus appeared bare and in direct contact with venous blood. xxvm. 69 2786. A large Lymphatic laid open. Its canal appeared filled by a large cylindrical growth, but this could be loosened and unravelled into the bundle of variously-shaped small bodies suspended on long branching stems, and con- sisting usually of nodules of cartilage imbedded in a softer tissue. xxviii. 70 2787. A cluster of small oval and rounded Tumours, which extended alon» the course of the spermatic cord, and were loosely connected with its structures. They are composed chiefly of small cylindrical and nodular pieces of cartilage, clustered with growths of a softer substance on slender threads, and enclosed in thin-walled canals. xxviii. 71 The four preceding specimens are from a case described by Sir J. Paget in the thirty-eighth volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. FIBROUS AND FIBRO-CYSTIC TUMOURS. 2788. Section of a Tumour occupying the Testicle. It is of nearly regular, oval shape, and about six inches in its chief diameter. It is lobed, and now close-textured, tough, pure white, like firm connective tissue. In the recent state it was succulent and translucent, its substance being infiltrated with a clear, yellow, serous, and synovia-like fluid. Part of the tunica albuginea is reflected from its surface, and within this part seminal tubes were found spread out around it. m* n The patient was 37 years old, and the growth of the tumour was observed for seven vears In microscopic structure it showed scarcely anything but fibro-cellular tissue, in bundles of well- tormed filaments mingled with elongated fibre-cells. A diagram (No. 326) shows the tumour in its recent state. Presented by Dr. Ormerod. 2789. A Testicle, removed by operation. Its interior is occupied by a tumour developed among the tubuli seminiferi and still surrounded by a thin laver of them. The lower part of the tumour is formed by a homogeneous compact yellow substance; but its chief mass is composed of a firm tissue, traversed bv white fibres, m which there are numerous cysts. The walls of the cvsts are closely connected with the surrounding tissue, and are lined by a polished membrane. Most of them were filled by a fluid resembling mucusf othera con- tained a fluid like serum ; and in one, a small lobulated growth has arisen from the interior of the wall and nearly fills the cavity. xxvni. 51 From a gentleman of middle age, in whom the tumour had erown slowlv TiW ™„ the operation he was in perfect health. g J' iour ?ears after 2790, is a Two Testicles (probably from the same person), in each of which there large oval mass of firm, obscurely-fibrous, and spongy substance with small cysts thickly interspersed in many parts of it.

A Testicle, in which there is a large firm tumour, in^ parts appearing fibrous, in parts spongy, and having numerous cysts, with distinct membranous walls imbedded in its substance. In some of the larger cysts there are growths of soft substance. The opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis are partially adherent. xxviii. 24 2793. Section of a large Fibro-cystic Tumour in a Testicle. The tumour forms a broadly-oval mass, and is chiefly composed of a very firm, dense, and elastic, greyish-white substance, intersected by white lines, which have some appear- ance of radiating and forming close-set lobes. It has, in these respects, a close resemblance to the firmest fibro-muscular tumours of the uterus. Numerous cysts are imbedded in all parts of it. They have smooth and polished internal surfaces, and could not be dissected from the surrounding substance of the tumour. In the recent state they were filled with liquid, which in some was like serum, m some like serum mixed with pus, in some creamy, in some brown, thick and grumous. Portions of cartilage, also, in small nobules, are thinly scattered in the substance of the tumour. The tunica albuginea, extended round the tumour, is much thickened; on its internal surface a thin layer of seminal tubes was found spread out. The patient was 58 years old. He believed that the disease had been twenty years in progress, and that it commenced in inflammation of. the testicle during gonorrhoea. The testicle, after this inflammation, had remained enlarged, but no certain increase of it was noticed till ten years later. From that time the increase was constant, though slow. The patient recovered after the removal of the testicle, and for at least twelve months had no return of the disease. 2794. Section of a Testicle, in which the place of the natural structure is occupied by a large oval mass of firm fibrous substance, in which some small portions of cartilage and many cysts are imbedded. xxviii. 17 SARCOMATA. 2795. A Sarcoma of the Testicle, containing a large mass of cartilage, which is arranged in the same manner as in the Specimens Nos. 2783 and 2784. new 2796. Sections of a Testicle, occupied by a round-cell sarcoma. The growth is lobed, pale, soft, and greyish. Imbedded in its lower part, and separated from it by a thin filamentous capsule, is an oval mass of cartilage, from an inch and a half to two inches in diameter. Points of bone are scattered in the cartilage, which is arranged in tortuous columns or rods. xxviii. 62 The patient was 38 years old. The disease was observed in progress for eighteen months. Death occurred a fortnight after the removal of the disease, and secondary deposits were found in the lumbar lymphatic glands, but they contained no cartilage. A drawing, No. 481, shows the parts in the recent state. 2797. A Testicle, occupied by a soft new growth, at the lower part of which is a larsre nodule of cartilage. The constituents of the tumour had been much altered by long immersion in spirit, but it appeared to be a round-cell sarcoma. The cartilage was arranged in nodules, and consisted of small flattened nuclei, surrounded by a hyaline matrix. The connective tissue surrounding the nodules contained bands of spindle-cells. The testicle was removed after death, from a man aged 45 years. There were numerous secondary deposits in various parts of the body. Microscopic sections of the cartilage are preserved, No. 120. Presented by R. O. Clarke, Esq. MEDULLARY CANCERS. 2798. Section of a Medullary Cancer of the right Testicle. The organ measuredDISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 421 seven or eight inches in length by five or six in breadth ; it was of an uneven pyriform shape, tense and of soft semi-fluctuating consistence. The softness w as at some points so extreme as to have given many the impression that the disease was cystic. The testicular surface of the tunica vaginalis is perfectly smooth, and at no part adherent to the scrotal surface. The spermatic cord and epididymis are not involved in the morbid growth. The section of the tumour is divided into three or four lobules of unequal size. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour is divided into oval or irregular alveoli by broad trabecular of imperfectly developed connective tissue containing a large number of round, oval, and spindle-shaped nuclei. The alveoli enclose closely-packed round or oval cells, of very uniform size; in a few instances a thin rim of unstained protoplasm can be seen surrounding the large deeply-stained nucleus. The normal st ructure of the testicle can nowhere be recognised. From a man, aged 34 years. Fourteen months before admission to the Hospital he first noticed a slight enlargement of his right testicle, and subsequently it steadily increased in size. His general health was not affected, and he suffered no pain, only some inconvenience from the weight of the organ. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 122.—See Aberneihy Ward Book, vol. v£p. 380. 2799. A Medullary Cancer of the Testicle, injected. The organ measures five inches long by four broad. The two layers of the tunica vaginalis are adherent to each other. On the surface of the section the outline of the testicle proper is still distinguishable; it is marbled by the intermixture of brownish-red masses with the white medullary substance; the injection has not penetrated into this part of the tumour. Above and below the infiltrated epididymis is cut across. Its numerous vessels are injected ; the growth is here softer and more brain-like. Microscopic Examination.—The irregularly dilated ducts of the testicle are in places dis- tinguishable ; they are filled with small granular cells intermingled with much granular debris. There is no alveolar arrangement, except that produced by the dilated ducts. In some parts of the tumour there is a large quantity of connective tissue, almost destitute of cells. From a man, aged 35 years. His right testicle began to enlarge six or eight months before his admission to the Hospital, without evident cause ; it increased in size very rapidly. The testicle was oval, smooth, soft, and semi-fluctuating.—See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. v, p. 434. 2800. A Medullary Cancer of the Left Testicle, which had descended through the inguinal canal, but had not reached the scrotum. In the operation for its removal the diseased testicle was found lying immediately beneath the integu- ments and outside the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The right testicle was healthy and in the normal situation. From a man, aged 25 years. 2801. Section of a Testicle occupied by a large oval mass of soft, medullary substance, probably soft cancer. The morbid growth extends from the upper part of the testicle into the cellular tissue of the spermatic cord. The opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis are adherent. xxvin. 31 2802. A similar specimen. The growth is traversed by partitions which divide it into many round masses. The tunica albuginea is thickened, and the opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis are adherent. xxviii. 12 2803. A Testicle, with a portion of the abdominal walls. The place of the testicle _ is occupied by a soft, brown medullary substance. The tunica vaginalis communicated with the cavity of the abdomen. xxviii. 40 From the same patient as No. 2291 in Scries XXTV, and No. 2219 in Series XXI.422 DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. CYSTS CONNECTED WITH THE TESTICLE AND EPIDIDYMIS. ENCYSTED HYDROCELE OF THE TESTICLE. 2804. An Encysted Hydrocele of the Testicle; the cyst is nearly as large as a hazel nut, and situated in the usual position, close to the head of the epididymis. The cyst contained a clear watery fluid, in which some small cells were visible, but no spermatozoa were found. There was also a small hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. The testicle was soft and ill-developed. 2805. A similar specimen. xxviii. 41 2806. A Testicle, with part of the Spermatic Cord. Along the epididymis there is a series of thin and delicate membranous cysts communicating together, and having for their boundary the tunica vaginalis at its reflection between the testicle and epididymis. They contained a transparent and colourless fluid. A bristle is passed beneath the vas deferens near its connection with the epididymis. xxviii. 43 2807. A right Testicle, with the Spermatic Cord. There is a large cyst immediately above the testicle, and closely connected with the epididymis. Other smaller cysts lay between the testicle and epididymis, and in the substance of the epididymis; the fluid within the latter contained abundant spermatozoa, but none were found in the large cyst. The cavity of the tunica vaginalis was slightly distended with fluid. The fundus of a large hernial sac extends down the cord as far the upper part of the testicle; it appears to have been a funicular hernia. Sections of the epididymis showed under the microscope an irregular dilatation of some of the tubuli, suggesting the origin of the cysts from dilated ducts. Taken from the body of a man, aged 90 years. 2808. The left Testicle, taken from the same patient as the preceding. There is a similar large encysted hydrocele of the testicle, which contained spermatozoa. The epididymis also contained small cysts, and some of the ducts were found with the microscope to be dilated. A small hydatid of Morgagni existed on the head of the epididymis of both testicles. 2809. A Testicle, with the Tunica Vaginalis. There are several very thin- walled cysts of different sizes communicating with each other, and nearly surrounding the upper and anterior part of the testicle ; none of them appear to communicate with the tunica vaginalis, but some of the smaller cysts are closely connected with the epididymis. xxviii. 3 2810. Slightly opalescent Fluid, containing an abundance of spermatozoa. From a hydrocele of the testis. xxviii. 72 ####### PEDUNCULATED BODIES ATTACHED TO THE EPIDIDYMIS. 2811.

An elongated, lobed, fatty Tumour, removed, after death, from the loose connective tissue of a spermatic cord. xxxv. 66DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 423 2813. Section of a Tumour of rather soft consistence and fibrous appearance. It measured about two inches in length, and one and a half in breadth. The tumour was removed with the testicle from a child, aged 13 months. The mother had noticed a swelling in the groin for six months. The tumour lay partly in the scrotum, and partly in the groin. On dissection, the spermatic cord was found on the posterior surface of the growth, which was immediately above the epididymis, and covered by the infundibuliform fascia. t , Microscopic examination showed that the tumour consisted of mucoid tissue, and ill developed connective tissue containing round and spindle-shaped cells.—See Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxxi, 1881. Presented by W. J. Walsham, Esq. HYDROCELE OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. 2814. A Hydrocele in the Spermatic Cord. There is a single large cyst immediately above and behind the testicle. Its inner surface is fascicu- lated, but lined by a distinct smooth polished membrane, which has no con- nection with the tunica vaginalis and epididymis. The opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis, which were adherent throughout, have been partially separated. The testicle is healthy. xxvin. 10 2815. A Hydrocele in the Spermatic Cord. There are two distinct large cysts which do not communicate. One of these is situated above the testicle, and the other behind it. They are both lined by a distinct membrane, which can readily be dissected from the surrounding structures, as was also the case in the preceding specimen. xxvill. 28 HEMATOCELE OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. 2816. A large Cyst in the Spermatic Cord, which contained blood. The cyst is situated just above the testicle, and the tissues round it are thickened, in- durated, and consolidated. Part of the tunica vaginalis has been removed; the opposite surfaces were completely adherent. xxvin. 11► SERIES XXXVII. DISEASES OF THE SCROTUM. HYPERTROPHY. 2817. A Scrotum greatly enlarged, in connection, probably, witb a large bernia or bydrocele ; for tbere is no apparent morbid cbange of structure in any of its tissues. xxviii. 16 ELEPHANTIASIS. 2818. A Scrotum greatly enlarged, witb thickening and induration of tbe skin and subjacent tissue. Tbe surface of tbe skin is elevated in lobes and folds separated by deep fissures, and wrinkled. The subjacent tissue is compact and filamentous, like tbe tissue of firm skin. Tbe sebaceous glands are enlarged, and exbibit wide open orifices, surrounded by elevated rings : they are especially numerous at the upper part of the diseased structure. xxviii. 18 Vide Oast. No. 150. TUMOURS. FIBRO-CELLULAR TUMOURS. 2819. A large Fibro-cellular Tumour, which was removed from the scrotum with a portion of the integument. xxviii. 75 2820. Part of a Tumour from a scrotum, which weighed twenty-four pounds, and was about a foot in length. It is lobed, firm, elastic, white, and composed of compact, fibro-cellular tissue. In the recent state, many parts of it were infiltrated with serum, making them quite succulent; and in some there were extravasations of blood. At the lower part of tbe mass, the testicle and its tunica vaginalis (which contained some ounces of serous fluid) are shown flattened by its pressure. xxxv. 70 The patient was 74 years old, and the tumotir was of five and a-half years' growth. It was easily separable from the surrounding parts, into which many lobes extended far from its chief mass. It was complicated, not only with the hydrocele above mentioned, but with a large scrotal hernia that descended to its upper part, and with thickening and cedema of the scrotum. The diagram No. 327 represents the tumour in its present state. HORNY GROWTHS. 2821. A Horny Growth removed from the scrotum. From the history of tbe case, it is believed to have originated in a wart. The portion of skin close to the base of tbe horny growth is the seat of a papillated, raised, slightly ulcerated growth, which was found on microscopic examination to be an epithelioma. xxviii. 74 2822. Horny Growths which were removed from the scrotum of a chimney- sweeper, where they had existed some months. During tbe last nine years five425 DISEASES OF THE SCROTUM. similar growths had formed and had been shed. After attaining a certain size, the base became surrounded by a ring of ulceration, and at length the least violence sufficed to detach them. On the skin in the neighbourhood small dark warty growths were scattered. These had appeared in the last twenty years. EPITHELIOMA. 2823. Portion of a Scrotum, on the surface of which there is an elevated, oval, warty growth, of firm texture, with a slightly granular, smooth, convex surface, which was vascular but not ulcerated. The margins of the growth project a little over the surface of the adjacent skin. By the side of this growth is one of smaller size and superficially ulcerated. xxvm. 57 From a young chimney-sweeper. 2824. Portion of the Scrotum of a chimney-sweeper, of which a large part of the surface is covered by a very elevated papillated epithelioma of firm compact substance, the surface of which is nodular, deeply fissured, and ulcerated. xxvm. 58 2825. Portion of the Scrotum of a chimney-sweeper, in which, by the further progress of the disease shown in the two preceding specimens, there is a deep epitheliomatous ulcer, with thickened sinuous margins. Along one margin of the ulcer there are several small warty growths, like that in No. 2823, and superficially ulcerated. xxvm. 59 2826. Portions of Skin affected with epithelioma, the larger portion from the scrotum; the smaller from the perineum. On the latter, are two small can- cerous warts, one prominent and branched, the other nearly subcutaneous. On the former, the cancerous disease appears partly in deep ulceration, partly in the form of large warty growths. The margins of the ulcer, shown especially on the right side, are, for the most part, sinuous, raised, and everted; its base appears coarsely warty. The chief warty growth is at the lower part of the specimen. Its surface is nodular and fissured, and from many parts of it there arise conical, curved, sharp-pointed bodies, about one-third of an inch in length, firm and white, like the strong papill® of a carnivorous tongue. The cancerous structures extend to a depth of from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch. Their microscopic constituents are those of epithelioma. xxviii. 61 The patient -was a healthy-looting chimney-sweeper, 25 years old. He had observed one of the small warts in the perineum for four years. The disease in the scrotum had existed only one year ; and its progress was so rapid, both by ulceration and by sub-cutaneous extension, that it was necessary to remove all the skin of the scrotum, except a small piece at its lower part, a portion of the skin of the perineum, the prepuce, and all the skin of the penis, except a narrow ring round its middle, and nearly all the skin of the mons veneris. The ri<dit testicle, also, to which the base of the ulcer adhered, was removed ; and three enlarged inguinal glands. The patient recovered from the operation, and the wounds were healed in three months.SERIES XXXVIII. DISEASES OF THE VESIOULiE SEMINALES, AND VASA DEFERENTIA, 2827. Two specimens of Vesiculae Seminales, enlarged, indurated, and having deposits of caseous material upon their lining membranes. xxix. 14 Vide No. 2847 in the next Series. OBLITERATION OF THE VAS DEFERENS. Vide No. 2782, Series XXXVI. 2828. A Bladder, to the posterior part of which a cyst is attached, which contained hydatids. The vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia are closely connected with the cyst; and the lower part of the right vas deferens communicates with it by two orifices into which a bristle is passed. A portion of this vas deferens is wanting; and it appeared that the cyst might have originated in the dilatation of the deficient portion of the tube. The walls of the cyst are thin, but tough and firm; the hydatids found within it are at the bottom of the bottle. xxix. 15SERIES XXXIX. DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. HYPERTROPHY. 2829. A Prostate Gland, with parts of the bladder and rectum. The gland is greatly enlarged. The principal enlargement has taken place at the sides of the gland, and in the portion which is above and in front of the urethra: this portion is increased to upwards of an inch and a half in thickness, while the portion behind and below the urethra is scarcely thicker than is natural. The portion of the urethra is flattened laterally, and contracted. A portion of glass is introduced into a passage made by a trocar passed during life, from the rectum through the prostate gland into the urethra. The orifices of the ureters are much dilated. xxix. 1 2830. A Bladder, with the Prostate Gland greatly and uniformly enlarged. The urethra within the prostate is deepened and laterally compressed. The muscular coat of the bladder is hypertrophied; bristles are passed beneath strong fasciculi of muscular fibres extending from the ureters to the neck of the bladder. xxix. 3 2831. A Bladder and Prostate Gland. The prostate is much enlarged, and dis- tinct round portions of it project into the neck of the bladder, both behind and in front of the urethra. The urethra within the prostate takes a very oblique course, in consequence, apparently, of the left lobe of the gland being more en- larged than the right. xxix. 18 2832. A Bladder with the Prostate Gland laid open from the front. All the lobes of the prostate are greatly enlarged, and the third is deeply grooved along the mesial line; here a thin film of tissue bounds superiorly a passage which conducts into the bladder, the muscular coat of which is considerably hyper- trophied. xxix. 27 From an aged man, who had needed the daily employment of catheters for nine months preceding his death ; their route into the bladder is probably indicated by the above-mentioned groove and the canal which it contains. 2833. A greatly dilated Bladder, and the Prostate Gland. The three lobes of the prostate are enlarged, especially the third, which projects upwards almost at a right angle, and forms a valve over the vesical orifice. A piece of glass rod is placed in a false passage at the base of the middle lobe. The ureters and pelves of the kidneys were not dilated. From a man, aged 62 years, who never had any difficulty in micturition until eight days before his admission to the Hospital with retention. An elastic catheter was easily passed into the bladder.—See Henry Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 166. 2834. A Bladder with the Prostate Gland. The gland is generally enlarged ; but its posterior portion, or middle lobe, is enlarged much more than any other428 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. portion of it, and projects in the form of a round tumour into the cavity of the bladder, immediately behind the orifice of the urethra. The muscular coat of the bladder is hypertrophied. The ureters are dilated and thickened. Im- mediately above one of the ureters is a small cyst communicating with the bladder. xxix. 6 2835. A similar specimen; but the prostate not being divided, as it is in the preceding preparation, exhibits more plainly the manner in which, when enlarged, it projects into the neck of the bladder; and, especially, the manner in which the enlarged middle lobe projects behind and above, and partially overhangs, the orifice of the urethra. xxix. 7 2836. A Bladder and Prostate Gland. Both the lateral and middle lobes of the prostate are enlarged, but the middle lobe is enlarged in a much greater degree than the rest, and forms a nearly disc-shaped swelling, upwards of an inch in diameter, which projects into the cavity of the bladder; and overhangs the orifice of the urethra. The surface of this part is ulcerated. Several small cysts, or pouches, are formed by the protrusion of the mucous membrane between the hypertrophied muscular fibres of the bladder. xxix. 12 2837. A Bladder and Prostate Gland. The prostate is greatly enlarged, and its middle portion projects into the neck of the bladder, in the form of a large broad-based cone nearly two inches high. This part has been deeply torn by catheters, which were arrested by it in the attempt to relieve the retention of urine. The coats of the bladder are thick, but weak and flaccid. The mucous membrane is in many places depressed between the fasciculi of the muscular coat. xxix. 21 From a man, 70 years old, who had long had stricture of the urethra. The bladder was tapped above the pubes two months before death. He died exhausted with continued inflam- mation of the bladder and prostate. Vide No. 3291, Series L. IRREGULAR ENLARGEMENTS. 2838. A Bladder and Prostate Gland, with part of the Rectum. The prostate gland is exceedingly large, its surface is knobbed, and lobulated growths project from it into the cavity of the bladder. A passage was formed through the prostate by a catheter. The muscular coat of the bladder is thickened and its mucous membrane is ulcerated. At the upper and back part of the bladder is a large irregular aperture, formed by the sloughing of its coats, through which urine escaped into the abdomen. The rectum is much curved and compressed beneath the enlarged prostate. xxix. 11 2839. Section of a Bladder, Prostate Gland, and Urethra. The prostate gland is enlarged, and some tumours growing from it project into the bladder. There was a calculus in the bladder, which was removed by the lateral operation of lithotomy a fortnight before death; and in the progress of the operation one of the tumours arising from the prostate was completely detached. This tumour is suspended in the lower part of the bottle ; it is of oval form, about three- quarters of an inch in diameter, and appears to have been attached by a small pedicle. xxix. 9 The calculus is preserved in the Series of Urinary Calculi. 2840. Portion of an enlarged Prostate Gland, of irregular shape, and measuring from an inch to an inch and a half in its several diameters, which was cut and torn off in the operation of lithotomy. xxix. 26 The patient was about 40 years old, and had two large calculi. His recovery from the opera- tion was quick and apparently complete. 2841. A lobulated portion of an enlarged Prostate Gland, which was brought away in extracting a stone from the bladder. xxix. 30DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 429 ENLARGED PROSTATE GLANDS, PIERCED OR WOUNDED BY INSTRU- MENTS. „ 2842. A Bladder, with the Prostate Gland, exhibiting a general enlargement ot the gland, with predominant enlargement of its middle lobe. Ihe enlarged middle lobe, and the portions of the gland and of mucous membrane which connect it with the enlarged lateral lobes, form a ridge across the neck ot the bladder, behind the orifice of the urethra. Through the middle of this ridge a passage was formed by a catheter. xxix. o Presented by E. S. Eyles, Esq. Vide also Nos. 2837, 2838, 2849 in this Series; and 2423 in Series XXIX. FATTY DEGENERATION. 2843. Portion of a Prostate Gland which appears to have undergone complete fatty degeneration of all its structures. Its cut surfaces have the aspect of a firm, minutely lobed adipose tissue. xxix. 28 The patient was upwards of 70 years old. He had old stricture of the urethra, diseased bladder, and granular degeneration of the kidneys. ABSCESS IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. 2844. A Bladder and Prostate Gland. The prostate is almost completely destroyed and its place occupied by a large abscess cavity, the wall of which is formed apparently by the capsule of the gland. The abscess cavity com- municated above with the urethra, and also with an abscess between the bladder and symphysis pubis. A portion of glass rod is inserted into the urethra, and smaller portions are inserted into the ejaculatory ducts. The vesiculse seminales are compressed. The bladder is contracted and its wall is thicker than normal. The ureters are extremely dilated, and their openings into the bladder would admit a goose-quill. The pelves'of the kidneys were dilated, and the parenchyma was atrophied and contained cysts. No stricture of the urethra could be found. From a man, aged 39 years. His illness commenced three months before his admission to'the Hospital. He suffered from great pain in the bladder, difficulty in micturition, and passed ammoniaeal urine. For the last eight years he had occasionally passed small stones from the bladder.—See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 303. 2845. A Prostate Gland, in each lateral lobe of which there is a large irregular cavity, formed by ulceration, and communicating with the urethra by the sides of the caput gallinaginis. Urinary calculi have been formed in these cavities. The mucous membrane at the neck of the bladder aud in the prostatic part of the urethra is diffusely ulcerated. xxix. 10 TUBERCULAR DISEASE. 2846. Sections of a Prostate Glaud from a young man, with round circumscribed masses of caseous matter deposited in it. xxix. 19 There were tubercles in the lungs and other organs. The bladder of the same patient is preserved in Series XXIX, No. 2413. 2847. Prostate Gland, Vesiculce Seminales, and part of the Bladder. Sections of the prostate and left vesicula seminalis exhibit caseous matter deposited in the interior of each. In the vesicula seminalis the caseous matter forms a uniform lining to the mucous membrane, the reticular arrangement of the sur- face of which remains distinct. The prostate is almost uniformly infiltrated through its left half, and some of the caseous matter is softened : the right side of the prostate is nearly healthy. xxix. 20 From a young man in whom there were tubercles of the lungs and other organs. His left kidney is preserved in Series XXVIII, No. 2340. The right kidney was healthy. The left testicle had caseous deposits in its interior: the right was healthy. 2848. A Prostate Gland, of which nearly the whole substance has been destroyed by tubercular ulceration. Only a thin shell of the gland remains surrounding a cavity with irregular walls, which was traversed by some cords of the induratedDISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 430 tissue of the gland infiltrated with caseous matter, and which contained pus and detached portions of the gland. The cavity communicates by a wide orifice with the urethra. xxix. 23 The patient was an old man, who had tubercular disease of the lungs, kidneys, testicles, and other organs. He died with inflammation of the bladder. TUMOURS, AND OTHER ALLIED MORBID GROWTHS, IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. 2849. The lower part of a Bladder, with the Prostate Gland, laid open from the front. The right lobe of the prostate gland is enlarged by the growth within it of a tumour, over which its substance and capsule are thinly spread out. The tumour is of regular, roundly-oval shape, measuring about one and a half and two inches in its diameters, closely invested by the gland, yet easily enucleated from it. (A portion of it thus separated is suspended above the bladder.) Its cut surfaces show a very firm, dense texture, like that of a prostate gland, with numerous small cysts. The microscopic structures had the same resemblance to those of a natural prostate gland. The prostatic part of the urethra, is flat- tened by the projection of the tumour, and curved towards the left side. A piece of glass marks a passage made with a catheter through the right lobe of the prostate, by the side of the tumour. The left lobe of the prostate appears to be of natural size. xxix. 24 From a man, 51 years old, who, for two years before his death, had increasing difficulty in passing urine. Complete retention at length ensued, and was relieved with catheters, some or all of which passed through the prostate in the tract indicated in the specimen. After seven days, acute peritonitis, commencing apparently at the bladder, proved quickly fatal. 2850. A Tumour, bisected, which was removed from the interior of a urinary bladder. It was attached just behind the orifice of the urethra, over the middle lobe of the prostate gland, by a band or pedicle, composed of mucous membrane and muscular fibres, and measuring about half an inch in width and one-eighth of an inch in depth and thickness. The tumour (cut from the pedicle) is thinly invested with mucous membrane, like that of the bladder. It is of somewhat oval form, and measures from one and a half to two and a half inches in its several diameters. On its cut surfaces the tumour appears formed of very firm, tough, whitish substance, like that of prostate gland. It is intersected by shining white circling bands of fibres, which divide it into close-packed lobes, and it contains many small round and oval cysts, lined with smooth membrane. The microscopic appearances of the mass were exactly similar to those of the prostate gland, including both gland-structures and well-formed smooth muscular fibres. The tumour may, therefore, be regarded as one of the same kind as the preceding, which having grown from the prostate gland became pedunculated, and projected into the bladder. xxix. 25 The patient, 64 years old, was, for the last four years of his life, unable to pass urine with- out the help of the catheter. The tumour, as first seen after death, was described as "lying loose in the bladder, only connected to it by a pedicle, moving on this like a hinge, and, when pressed forwards, obstructing the orifice of the urethra." Presented by Mr. Wyman. 2851. A polypoid fibrous Tumour, which is attached by a narrow pedicle to the interior of the neck of the bladder. Above is suspended a portion of the tumour removed by section. The coats of the bladder are considerably thickened. xxix. 29 2852. A Bladder, with a uniformly enlarged Prostate Gland. Numerous warty growths of a soft substance are connected with the third lobe of the enlargedDISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 431 prostate, and thence extend, covering the mucous membrane of the bladder, as high as the orifices of the ureters. 2853. A Bladder and Prostate Gland, from a child, 5 years old. The prostate gland is considerably enlarged both in its lateral and middle lobes, lhe natural structure of the gland has entirely disappeared, and its place is occupied by medullary substance, a portion of which is of dark-greyish colour, perhaps from the deposit of melanotic matter. There are also similar dark-grey deposits m the cellular tissue around the prostate and the neck of the bladder. xxix. 1 ( The chfld had been subject for four mouths to irritabaity of the bladder Ten days before death it had retention of urin,. *hich was succeeded by paralysis of the bladde^ The ca e is described by Mr. Stafford, in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxn, p. 218. .London, 1839 Presented by E. A. Stafford, Esq. 2854. The Bladder and Prostate Gland of a child, 4 years old. None of the natural structure of the prostate can be discerned: in its place there is a mass of soft, white, obscurely fibrous, and shreddy, medullary substance, nearly spheroidal in form, and four inches in diameter. This mass projects backwards between the bladder and rectum, raising the pouch of peritoneum between them to the level of the upper part of the bladder: it must have nearly filled the pelvis. Its posterior and lower part is either superficially ulcerated or has been broken. The peritoneum covering its upper part is extremely congested. xxix. 22 CALCULI m THE PROSTATIC DUCTS. 2855.

From a man, who died with acute suppurative inflammation of the kidneys. He was at the time attending the Hospital for a stricture, which only admitted of the passage of a catgut bougie. .... •, A drawing of the kidneys is preserved No. 316.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. vm, p. 84, and John Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 26. 2858. Section of a Urethra, in which there is a stricture in its spongy portion, about two inches anterior to the bulb.- The stricture is annular, occupying only a small portion of the length of the urethra: the induration and contrac- tion of the canal being marked by an opaque-white line. The urethra behind the stricture is dilated. xxx- 3 2859. A lateral section of a Bladder and Urethra. There is an annular stricture of the urethra immediately before the bulb. The bladder is large, and its muscular coat is hypertrophied ; the fasciculi extending from the ureters to the prostate gland are remarkably developed. xxx. 9 2860. A Penis, exhibiting a stricture in the spongy portion of the urethra, about four inches from the external orifice. Half an inch of the length of the canal is almost obliterated; and the tissues around this part are thickened, indurated, and contracted.

A Penis, in which the canal of the urethra is traversed by eleven distinct cords or bands. These bands are flat and narrow, from the eighth of an inch to half an inch in length, and attached at both their extremities to the wall of the urethra. They lay close to the wall of the canal, but are now raised by portions of glass passed beneath them. They are all situated between the prostatic portion of the urethra and the part about two inches anterior to the bulb. xxx. 37 From a man in whom insti*ument3 had been very frequently passed for the cure of stricture.

DILATATION OF THE CANAL BEHIND THE STRICTURE. 2866. The anterior part of a Penis, with a stricture in the spongy portion of the urethra, about two inches from the external orifice. Behind the stricture the canal is dilated ; its walls also are thickened, and penetrated by an ulcerated aperture which leads into a fistulous passage extending to the integuments. xxx. 2 2867. Sections of a Urethra and Bladder. There is a stricture of the urethra about three inches anterior to the bulb, and behind it the whole of the urethral canal is dilated.

ULCERATION OF THE URETHRA AT, AND BEHIND THE STRICTURE. 2868. A Bladder and Urethra. There is a stricture in the urethra immediately anterior to the bulb. From the bulb to the bladder the mucous membrane of the urethra is ulcerated in some situations, and in others is covered by projectino- granulations with calculous matter deposited on them. The bladder is thickened and exceedingly contracted; and its mucous membrane, raised in deep ridges and folds, is superficially ulcerated and nearly covered by calculous matter. xxx. 13 2869. A Bladder and Urethra. A large portion of the urethra anterior to the bulb is superficially ulcerated, and two deeper ulcerations extend from this part into the adjacent tissues. One of the openings thus formed communicates with a sac enclosed by the indurated cellular tissue around the urethra. The muscular coat of the bladder is greatly hypertrophied, and its mucous mem- brane appears thickened and indurated ; its cavity was lined throughout by a thick layer of lymph, upon which calculous matter was deposited. The lymph was but loosely connected with the mucous membrane of the bladder, from which it has been separated and reflected in a continuous layer. xxx. 12 2870.

EXTRAVASATION OP URINE ; URETHRAL ABSCESS, AND FISTULA. 2872. A Bladder and Urethra, opened from the superior and anterior part. The mucous membrane of the bladder and urethra is thickened in its whole extent, but no part of the urethra appears especially contracted. Several small ulcerated openings have been formed in the spongy part of the urethra, near the bulb. The cut surfaces of the corpus cavernosum exhibit a sloughing appearance, in consequence of the escape of urine into it. The glans penis has been entirely removed by ulceration. xxx- ^ 2873. A Penis, exhibiting a stricture of the urethra two inches and a half from the external orifice. Behind the stricture, the whole length of the urethra is greatly dilated ; its walls are thickened, and its mucous membrane is deeply folded, and, in parts, superficially ulcerated. There are several small sacs, like the cavities of abscesses, close to the urethra : two of these communicate with its canal near the prostate. xxx- 2874. Section of a Penis, exhibiting a very narrow stricture in the spongy portion of the urethra, about three inches from the external orifice. Ulceration of the urethra has taken place at the seat of the stricture, and has extended through the indurated tissues around it, and communicates with numerous fistulous passages in the parts between the stricture and the bladder. xxx. 5 2875. A lateral section of a Bladder and Urethra. A stricture of the urethra, commencing an inch anterior to the bulb, is continued, with general thickening and induration of the tissues, to the prostate gland. In front of the stricture the canal of the urethra appears to be lost in a small circumscribed cavity, from which five or more fistulous passages lead into the adjacent parts ; one of these passages extends to the perineum. The muscular coat of the bladder is hypertrophied. One of the ureters is dilated into a small cyst at its termina- tion. xxx' 8 2876. A Bladder and Urethra, exhibiting some of the effects of stricture. A large opening exists in the urethra at the junction of the bulb with the mem- branous portion; it was formed by ulceration, and through it urine was effused into the perineum. The ulceration involved a stricture which had long- existed at this part; the canal of the urethra is of the natural calibre behind the opening. The bladder is contracted, and its muscular coat is hypertrophied. XXX. o£ 2877. A Bladder and Urethra. There is a stricture of the urethra at the bulb, and'in the anterior part of its membranous portion. The mucous membrane has ulcerated in the situation of the stricture. The mucous membrane of the bladder is thickened and formed into irregular eminences or ridges, which are covered by calculous matter. Ulceration has taken place through the prostate and the adjacent coats of the bladder at its lower and back part, and the aperture thus formed leads to a large irregular cavity, resulting from the effusion of urine into the cellular tissue between the bladder and the rectum. xxx. 16 2878.

CALCULI IMPACTED IN THE URETHRA. 2879. Section of a Bladder and Urethra. A disk-shaped calculus, seven-tenths of an inch in diameter, is fixed in the bulbous portion of the urethra. There is a slight stricture of the urethra immediately in front of the calculus ; and around and behind it the canal is dilated and superficially ulcerated. The coats of the bladder are greatly thickened. One of the lateral lobes of the prostate gland is enlarged. xxx. 11 The preparation is engraved in Dr. Marcet's "Essay on Calculous Disorders," PI. V. London, 8vo., 1817. 2880. Part of a Penis and Prostate Gland, with the Urethra laid open. An inch in front of the membranous part of the urethra a stricture exists, through which the continuity of the canal cannot now be traced, but which appears to have been extremely narrow. The urethra posterior to the stricture is dilated, and, immediately behind the contraction, a calculus, half an inch in diameter, is lodged in the most dilated part, projecting towards the perineum. The obstruction caused by the calculus, added to that of the stricture, appears to have completely closed the urethra. By the side of the stricture is a large cavity that was filled with foetid pus, and extends into the perineum, where it is laid open by a long incision. xxx. 39 The patient was about 45 years old, and had had stricture many years. Sudden retention of urine occurred, followed by rapid swelling and suppuration in the perineum. An incision was made into the perineum, and foetid pus was let out, but the calculus was not felt, and the retention was only partially relieved. EFFECTS OF THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURE. FALSE PASSAGES. 2881. A Penis, with a portion of the Bladder. The mucous membrane of the whole of the urethra is thickened. About two inches from its external orifice, the canal is contracted, forming a close annular stricture, behind which it is dilated in its whole length. From the stricture, a false passage, formed by catheters, is continued along the side of the urethra, in the corpus spongiosum, and through the prostate gland into the bladder. xxx. 18 2882. A Penis, exhibiting a stricture of the urethra about an inch anterior to the bulb. The mucous membrane is thickened and indurated in the situation of the stricture, and the canal behind it is much dilated.

Sections of a Penis, which was removed in consequence of extensive cancerous disease. In the lower half of the prepuce is a mass of firm cancer two inches in diameter, and nearly oval in form. The part of this mass which is near the glans has ulcerated deeply, and the lower half of the glans itself lias been similarly destroyed. The remains of the glans and the anterior third of the corpus spongiosum urethras appeared filled with cancerous substance ; and there is a nearly isolated round mass of cancer in the corpus cavernosum just behind the glans. xxx." 36 From a man, 75 years old. The disease had been eighteen months in progress. The penis was cut off close to the pnbes. A week after the operation the patient died with erysipelas. After death the inguinal and lumbar glands were found enlarged with cancerous disease • there were several small, white, hard cancerous tumours in the lungs; and pus was deposited in the wrist, elbow, and several other joints, and in the midst of the cancerous glands. 2899.

Cancerous ulceration of the Bladder with cancerous infiltration of the Penis, from a man, aged 42 years. The main symptoms during life were intense pain and difficulty in micturating through the greatly distended penis OnDISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URETHRA AND PENIS. 438 the lower surface of the bladder, corresponding to the aperture of the right ureter, is a large, deep, oval ulcer, with irregular ragged edges. The posterior and upper wall of the bladder was broken down, and its contents were prevented from extravasation into the abdominal cavity only by recent circumscribed peritoneal adhesions. The urethra was sound. The spongy and cavernous portions of the penis are infiltrated throughout with a firm homogeneous material of a dull white colour, exuding a fluid ou section. It presented the appearance and minute structure of hard cancer. The glans was the seat of superficial cancerous ulceration. The right kidney consisted merely of a dilated sac. The left was enlarged, but natural. There were cancerous deposits with the same anatomical characters, though softer, in the lungs, bronchial and lumbar glands; also between the periosteum and the front surface of the tibia, amongst the bones of the tarsus of the same leg, and in the sheath of the peronei tendons. The disease of the penis was of eighteen months' duration. The tumours in the skin had existed eight months. During life, there was no evidence of any of the other deposits. INJURIES TO THE PENIS. 2902. This piece of string was tied round the root of his Penis by a boy aged 9 years. It passed into the substance of the organ by ulceration, dividing the urethra. The tissues subsequently healed over it, and the canal of the urethra was imperfectly restored, a stricture resulting. The string was removed by operation. xxx- 40SERIES XLI. DISEASES OF THE OVARIES. CIRRHOSIS. 2903. Sections of two Ovaries. They are contracted, and their structure is dense and fibrous ; Graafian vesicles are visible. From a woman, aged 35 years, who menstruated regularly until two years before death, when the menses ceased abruptly. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. CYSTIC TUMOURS OF THE OVARY. 2904. A simple Ovarian Cyst, removed during life. A bougie is placed in a portion of the Fallopian tube connected with its walls, which are uniformly thin and smooth. The cyst contained twenty-seven pints and a half of fluid. It was removed after its contents had been evacuated through a small incision in the abdominal walls. The collapsed cyst having been withdrawn from the abdomen through this incision, a ligature was tied round the Fallopian tube and other parts connecting it with the uterus, and it was cut off. The patient completely recovered. Presented by Thomas King, Esq. 2905. 2905a. Ovarian Cysts distended and dried. xxxi. 27, 28 2906. The Ovaries taken from a woman, aged 42, an inmate of Bethlehem Hospital. She had ceased to menstruate for three or four years. They are laid open, and in the interior of each are numerous small simple cysts. They all contained fluid. 2907. An Ovary in which there is a small cyst, the walls of which, by the deposition of earthy matter, have become bone-like. xxxi. 19 2908. Sections of two Ovaries. Both of them are enlarged to about four times their ordinary size, and contain numerous round cysts, each of them one-third to half an inch in diameter, which were full of variously coloured serous and grumous fluids. XXXI- 21 The change appears to constitute an early stage of the disease, by which some of the large multilocular cysts of the ovaries are formed. The cysts here shown have the characters of enlarged Graafian vesicles. 2909. Portion of a large Ovarian Cyst. xxxi. 2 2910. Portion of a Cyst originating in the left Ovary. It communicated with the ileum by a small aperture between four and five inches above the cascal valve. Some weeks before death, after the discharge of a large quantity of fluid per anum, the abdominal tumour diminished in size, and the dulness to percussion over its region was replaced by tympanitic resonance. Vide also Nos. 3360, 3361 in Series L.DISEASES OF THE OVARIES. 440 PROLIFEROUS CYSTS. 2911. An Ovary, of which one half appears healthy, while, in the place of the other half, there are three cysts completely partitioned from each other and mutually compressed. A papillary growth springs from the wall of the lowest cyst. xxxi. 1 2912. A large Unilocular Proliferous Cyst of the Ovary; there are two small secondary cysts also proliferous at one part of the cyst-wall. Scattered over a considerable area of the inner surface of the cyst are numerous cancerous papil- lary growths, both discrete and aggregated into masses. The solitary growths present every variety in size, the largest being about the size of a small walnut; they are broad, rounded, and have a very slender pedicle. There are also irregular papillated masses covering a considerable surface. The cyst had no pedicle, and there were no adhesions ; it contained a dark brown fluid. Microscopic Examination of one of the Papillary Growths.—It was attached to the cyst-wall by a pedicle of fibrous tissue. From this thin trabecule of connective tissue branched out, again giving off finer secondary branches, which by anastomosing formed irregular spaces, mostly of an elongated shape. The margins of the spaces were covered by, and also inclosed round, granular cells, varying much in size, and containing a small nucleus. The centre of the spaces was either empty, or filled with colloid material. Among the innermost of the circumferential layer of cells, large hyaline nucleated cells were seen, in some cases signet-ring, and in others dissolving and merging into the colloid material occupying the centre of the alveolus; these forms appeared to be produced by colloid degeneration of the cells first described. From a woman, aged 60. She had noticed an enlargement of her abdomen for fourteen months. Ovariotomy was performed, from which she recovered.—See Martha Ward Book, March, 1879. Microscopic section, No. 127. 2913. A portion of a large Ovarian Cyst, with tumours and secondary cysts attached to its inner wall. The wall of the principal or outer cyst is from half a line to a line in thickness, and is composed of a tough fibrous tissue. The two largest tumours within it are oval in form; one measures five inches in its chief diameter, the other three inches; and each of them is attached by a small portion of its surface. Their sections show that they consist of medullary matter, in which are many cells filled with fluid and a gelatinous or mucous substance. There are several other tumours or cysts of small size attached to t^e internal walls of the great cyst, and full of fluid or medullary matter. xxxi. 20 From a woman, about 35 years old. The great cyst in which the tumours are inclosed had been several times tapped, and large quantities of serous fluid had been removed. It is probable that the malignant tumours had formed late in the course of the disease; for in the earlier periods, when the cyst was completely emptied by tapping, no solid masses could be felt in it. DERMOID CYSTS. 2914. Portion of Bone, in which an incisor and two molar teeth are fixed in cavities like alveoli. It was imbedded in the wall of an ovarian cyst. xxxi. 22 2914a. A portion of a Secondary Cyst, from a large ovarian cystoma. A hairy pendulous growth, from which the cusp of a tooth projects, is attached to the cyst-wall.

Portions of a large Ovarian Cyst, the principal cavity of which contained fatty matter with long slender hairs. Part of the cyst-wall is thick, dense, and irregularly laminated; another part is thin, and on this part a small portion presents a surface like that of ordinary cutis. Portions of fat and hairs are still attached to some parts of the interior of the cyst, while in others teeth, with well-formed crowns and short fangs, are imbedded. xxxi. 8 2918. A mass of Fatty Matter and Hair, closely mixed as if rolled and matted together, which was removed from the ovarian cyst last described. xxxi. 9 2919. Another portion of the same Ovarian Cyst. On its inner surface is an elevation formed by adipose tissue, and covered by a dense layer which exactly resembles human skin placed on its subcutaneous fat; the skin presents on its free surface the orifices of numerous close-set hair follicles. Similar orifices are less closely placed on the adjacent smooth surface of the cyst, and from many of them, both on this surface and on that of the skin-like layer, pale slender hairs, which have well-formed bulbs, project. xxxi. 10 The three preceding preparations were taken from a lady, 63 years old, who died shortly after the removal of the cancerous breast, preserved in No. 3165, Series XLVIII. 2920. Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary, containing fat and hairs. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2921. Portion of a large Proliferous Cyst, which was connected with the ovary of an old woman. The walls of the cyst are composed of several layers of a very dense tissue.

A Parovarian Cyst, consisting of one large and one small loculus; a small portion of the Fallopian tube is attached to the upper part of the cyst. Eemoved by operation from a lady, aged 25 years, who two years before sought advice on account of increasing enlargement of the abdomen. A fluctuating tumour occupied the lower part of the abdomen, extending to the umbilicus. On bi-manual examination it was found to be so closely connected with the cervix uteri that it was believed to be possibly a gravid uterus. The menstruation was, however, stated to be regular. Three months later the tumour had greatly increased in size, and many ounces of clear lluid were evacuated by tapping; the fluid contained only a trace of albumen, and was loaded with chlorides. After an interval of six months the cyst had again filled, but was ruptured by the patient accidentally falling upon her abdomen The tuniour soon after reappeared, and ovariotomy was performed with a fatal result.

One-half of a Tumour, which was removed from the situation of the left ovary of a woman, aged 55 years. It is composed of loose fibrous tissue. A similar, though somewhat smaller growth, occupied the situation of the right ovary. She had been conscious of the existence of some tumour of the abdomen for two years. 2927. A Uterus and Ovaries. The place of each ovary is occupied by a large, hard, oval tumour, nodulated on its external surface. The tumours consist of a very dense and hard, obscurely fibrous tissue, and upon the surface, as well as in the interior of each, there are small membranous cysts, which contained a serous fluid. The uterus is healthy. xxxi. 17 From a woman, 38 years old, whose breast had been removed three years before death on account of hard cancer. Presented by Richard Allen, Esq. 2928. A Uterus and Ovaries. The ovaries are altered in form; their natural structure is removed, and its place is occupied by a very soft melanotic matter.

Specimen showing an abscess in the broad ligament, which is stuffed with hair. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. HHEMATOMA OF THE BROAD LIGAMENT. 2940. The Uterus and its appendages. Between the layers of the right broad ligament is a globular cyst, about as big as a walnut, the wall of which, in the recent state, was seen to be formed by the separated layers of the ligament; its cavity was filled with quite recent blood coagula. On the anterior aspect of the cyst were two small, recently formed, irregular openings. From a patient, aged 25, who, while in the Hospital for the treatment of warts on the vulva, was suddenly attacked with the symptoms of internal haemorrhage and died in twelve hours. At the post mortem examination the cavity of the peritoneum contained five pints of recently445 DISEASES OF THE UTERINE APPENDAGES. effused, loosely coagulated blood; and dark fluid blood oozed slowly from the openings in the cyst above described. The interior of the uterus, along with all the other parts ot the body, was very pale. A very careful examination of the blood-cyst failed to discover the source ot the hemorrhage. There was no evidence of the existence of extra-uterine pregnancy, and no rup- tured vessel was detected. It was uncertain whether the patient was menstruating at the date of the attack.

The section is white, firm, fibrous, and shows numerous irregular loculi, which contained yellowish serum. The tumour was found on microscopic examination to consist solely of dense fibrous tissue. Eemoved from the body of a woman, aged 63 years. On opening the abdomen the tumour projected above the symphysis pubis ; it lay above the uterus and bladder, and in front of the right ovary. The ovaries and other pelvic viscera were normal.—Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 214. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 129.SERIES XLIII DISEASES OF THE UTERUS. DISPLACEMENTS. ANTEFLEXION. 2943. Model of a Section of an ill-developed Uterus, affected with extreme anteflexion. There is no obliteration of the canal, and no thinning of the uterine wall at the point of flexion. 2943a. Cast of the same Uterus entire. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2944. A Uterus, with acute anteflexion and a slight lateral inclination. A dimple on the mucous membrane is the only indication of the bs; there is no com- munication between it and the cervical canal. The cavity of the body of the uterus appears normal. RETROFLEXION. 2945. Sections of a Uterus, with a well-marked retroflexion. From a woman, aged 32 years. She did not complain of any uterine trouble.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 117. PROCIDENTIA. 2946. A Uterus, with part of the Vagina, exhibiting a prolapsus of the uterus, with considerable elongation of its neck and enlargement of the portion which projects into the vagina. xxxn. 30 2947. A vertical antero-posterior Section of a Uterus, and of the peritoneal pouches between it and the bladder and rectum, from a case of prolapsus uteri with eversion of the vagina. The os uteri was protruded beyond the labia. ^ Its cavity is elongated. The pouches of peritoneum are very deep, and contained portions of the small intestines which were protruded in them as in a hernia. A bristle is placed in the right ureter. xxxn. 35 2948. The body of the Pubes with the external organs of generation. The vagina is everted, forming a tumour seven inches and three quarters in length, and thirteen inches in circumference at its widest part. This tumour has been laid open and the flap turned upwards; it contains at its lower extremity the uterus and its appendages, the broad ligaments being much thickened and the round ligaments thickened and elongated. At its anterior and upper part is the bladder which is opened and the tracks of the urethra and ureters are indicated by the coloured directors. Just above, and on the outer side of the everted vagina, is the external opening of the urethra, and at its lower extremity is that of the uterus. The remainder of the cavity was occupied by a portion of smallDISEASES OF THE UTERUS. 44 7 intestine measuring seven feet eight inches in length, its coils matted together and adherent to the walls of the sac. xxxii. 55 From a woman who had suffered from procidentia uteri for fifteen years. About three weeks before death the procidentia suddenly became more extensive. The tumour could not be reduced, peritonitis ensued, and was the immediate cause of the fatal result. The case is fully related in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xi, p. 577. INVERSION. 2949. A Uterus and its appendages with part of the Vagina. The uterus is entirely inverted, with the exception of the cervix, which, however, does not cause any constriction, the finger passing easily between it and the uterine wall. The openings of the Fallopian tubes into the uterus cannot be dis- covered on its inverted surface. The peritoneum at the point of inversion is thickened and uneven. The uterine appendages are drawn into the cul-de-sac formed by the inverted uterus. This inversion was irreducible, and the displacement of the uterus caused death, in consequence of frequently recurring haemorrhage, twenty-nine months after its occurrence. xxxii. 56 The case is reported by Dr. West in the Proceedings of the Pathological Society of London, vol. iii, p. 140. 2950. A Uterus and its appendages. The fundus is inverted, and in the sac thus formed a portion of the broad and round ligaments and the Fallopian tubes were found. It occurred after delivery. xxxii. 73 2951. The body of an inverted Uterus excised in the Royal Infirmary of Edin- burgh. Case recorded in Edinburgh Medical Journal for March, 1877. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. Vide No. 3092 in Series XLVL ADHESIONS OF THE UTERUS TO THE SURROUNDING STRUCTURES. 2952. A Uterus, with one of the ovaries and the corresponding Fallopian tube turned round and adherent to its surface. The Fallopian tube and ovary are themselves closely united by old adhesions. The opposite ovary and the extremity of its Fallopian tube are also similarly connected, but are not adherent to the uterus. xxxi. 6 2953. A Uterus, with the adjacent parts. As the result of perimetritis, irregular adhesions have formed about the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, and broad ligaments. The left broad ligament is much contracted, and the body of the uterus is thus drawn to the left side, so that its axis is almost at a right angle to that of the vagina.

The cervix is affected with epithelial cancer, by which the canal is obliterated. The cavity of the fundus is greatly dilated and was filled with pus. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2956. A Uterus, in the side wall of which a large fibroid is imbedded. In its growth the tumour has bent the uterus laterally, and so encroached upon its cavity, that the cervical canal was shut off from the body. (A portion ofDISEASES OF THE UTERUS. us glass now shows their continuity.) The cavity of the body of the uterus, which is greatly dilated, was filled with pus; its walls are thinned; its mucous membrane was intensely vascular. xxxn. 52 Presented by Mr. Brendon.

A Uterus, of which the body is atrophied and flattened, while the part which projects into the vagina is very large and changed in shape, so as to give the appearance of a tumour of the cervix. xxxn. 31 2959. An Os Uteri and part of an elongated Cervix, removed by operation. The enlargement, due to a hypertrophy of the fibrous tissue contained in these parts, caused such inconvenience to the patient from its induration and projec- tion into the vagina as to necessitate its removal. xxxn. 68 2960. Part of a Cervix Uteri, removed by operation. It is enlarged and hard, and its surface is nodulated. The os uteri is wide and irregularly fissured at its sides. A section of the portion removed displays an interior structure which differs little from the healthy character of the uterine tissue. xxxn. 17 A Drawing is preserved, No. 502. 2961. Simple Hypertrophy, with superficial ulceration of a cervix uteri, removed by the ecraseur. 2962. Section of a Uterus and of a firm Fibrous Polypoid Mass which has grown from nearly the whole circumference of its neck. A ligature was placed around the growth near the line of its connection with the uterus ; but the death of the woman took place before the ligature had separated. A portion of glass occupies the groove in which the ligature was tied, and it will be observed that this groove, in a part of its extent, is formed in the substance of the uterus, the neck of which is elongated and almost imbedded in the upper part of the polypus. xxxn. 3 TUMOURS. MUCOUS POLYPI. 2963. A Mucous Polypus of the cervix uteri. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2964. A Uterus, in the walls of which many Fibrous Tumours have grown. One, more than an inch in diameter, is inclosed in the upper and posterior wall, and projects far into the cavity, covered with a thin layer of muscular and mucous tissue. Three, of small size, are seated near the right Fallopian tube, just under the peritoneum. Another polypus, probably mucous, is suspended by a narrow pedicle, half an inch long, from the anterior wall, just within the internal os. This last, projecting and pendulous beyond the os uteri, is elongated, oval, and apparently softened and changed in texture, in consequence of its pedicle having been tied shortly before death. xxxn. 49 The patient was 40 years old, and had suffered with menorrhagia for two or three years. The pedicle of the growth was tied with a double canula; but on the following day dysuria ensued, then retention of urine, then signs of peritonitis, and death occurred on the third day after that of the operation.

A sessile Fibrous Polypus, attached to the lowest part of the body of the uterus. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2969. A Uterus, with a Fibrous Polypus. The form of the tumour makes it pro- bable that it is composed of two fibrous tumours, which were developed in the wall of the uterus, and protruded into its cavity enveloped by a part of the uterine Avail, which now forms the pedicle or neck attaching them to its fundus. The larger portion of the tumour lay in the vagina. xxxii. 9 2970. A Uterus, having attached to its partially inverted fundus a true Fibrous Polypus, the body of which is in the vagina. Similar tumours of smaller size have formed, some near the peritoneal surf ace, and others in the substance of the uterus. The vessels of the uterus have been injected, and the injection has entered the tumours. xxxii. 32 2971. A large Fibrous Polypus of the Uterus. Its pedicle passes through the cervix. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2972. A Uterus, with a firm Fibrous Polypus, attached to the upper wall of its cavity. A ligature was placed around the neck of the polypus eight days before the patient's death. Fatal peritonitis followed. The portion of the polypus below the ligature is intensely congested, and a portion of its surface has sloughed.

A Uterus, showing a minute sub-peritoneal Fibroid, and a smaller pedunculated fibroid. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2979. A Uterus, with two small Fibrous Tumours. One of these tumours was attached by a small pedicle, which has given way. The other is but slightly fixed to the wall of the uterine cavity, which was dilated round it and in close apposition with its surface. XXXII. 8 2980. Section of a Uterus, with a firm Fibrous Tumour imbedded in the middle of its anterior wall. The vessels of the uterus are minutely injected; but none of the injection appears in the morbid growth. xxxn. 6 2981. Portion of a Uterus, with a Fibrous Tumour imbedded in it. The tumour is of oval form, smooth on its external surface, and composed of a firm, dense, greyish substance, partitioned and variously intersected by white shining bands. It is but loosely connected with the substance of the uterus; and has been partially separated from the uterine wall. xxxn. 7 2982. A Uterus and its appendages. A small Fibrous Tumour projects from its posterior wall, and through this an incision has been made to show the structure characteristic of these growths. XXXII. 67 2983.

Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 2987. A Uterus, the upper half of which is enlarged by the growth of numerous Fibrous Tumours in its walls. One tumour, larger than the rest, projects into the dilated upper part of the cavity of the uterus, and completely fills it; five others are shown, by the section, imbedded in the anterior wall, and many others project upon the external surface of the uterus. The lower half of the uterus is healthy, but elongated. The walls of the portion occupied by the tumours are thick and laminated, like the walls of the uterus in pregnancy. XXKIT. 16451 DISEASES OF THE UTERUS. 2988. A Uterus, with a large Fibrous Tumour in its posterior wall, whence it projects backwards covered by the peritoneal coat of the organ. xxxii. 27 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 2989. A Uterus. A large Intramural Fibroid occupies its posterior wall and projects above the fundus and below the cervix. The portio vaginalis is gone ; the cervix opens by a round orifice, which admits the little finger into the uterine cavity, the wall of which (except the posterior wall formed by the fibroid) is hardly thicker than a fold of blotting paper. No connection between the Fallopian tubes and the uterine cavity can be found. The extreme length of the uterine cavity from the os externum is four and a half inches, the extreme breadth two inches. A coronal section of the cavity is spindle- shaped. Both ovaries are atrophied, especially the right. At the junction of the right Fallopian tube with the uterus, and above the tube, is a sub-peritoneal fibroid, the size of a small orange, calcified en coq, the calcification extending also into its interior. 2990. An extremely vascular Fibro-Cellular Tumour, removed from the vagina. It was attached by a narrow base to the posterior lip of the os uteri. The hasmorrhage which followed the operation was easily restrained by plugging the vagina. xxxn. 64 2991. The Uterus of a woman, aged 37. To the anterior portion of the fundus a large pendunculated Fibroid is attached. When she was admitted into the Hospital, the tumour completely filled the vagina, and presented a sloughing surface. It was forcibly drawn down and the lower half of it removed. The woman died a week afterwards of peritonitis. The uterus itself is very much enlarged, and upon its fundus, immediately beneath the peritoneum, is a tumour of a similar character, about the size of a marble. xxxii. 79 2992. Section of a very large Fibrous Tumour from a Uterus. One surface of the section is rough and shreddy, from sloughing; the others show the characteristic structure of the fibrous tumour, a greyish, dense, and touo-h basis traversed by circling and wavy shining white bands. xxxii. 26 Presented by Dr. Conquest.

She had observed the tumour for twenty years, but had borne during that time many children. For eight years, after the birth of her last child, her health had been very delicate, and she had a constant discharge of blood by the vagina. For many weeks prior to the discharge of the tumour, which was expelled with pains like those of labour, flakes of bone passed away such as are still attached to its surface. Her recovery, after the expulsion of the tumoui*, was complete. Presented by Mr. Covey. 3000.

The specimen was removed from a young woman aged 21. It had been growing six years. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 132.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 345. 3025. A large Fibro-cellular Tumour, which was attached by a broad pedicle to the left labium of a woman, aged 35. It had existed for ten years. Three years previous to its removal the woman contracted syphilis, since which time it had rapidly enlarged. xxxu. 80 3026. Section of a Large Tumour, which formed within a labium pudendi. It consists throughout of a tough and compact substance, with closely interwoven fibres, like indurated cellular tissue. xxxv. 19 The tumour was removed from a lady, 28 years old. It had been observed four years ; had given no pain, and interrupted no function, though it was twice as large as au adult's head. It commenced its growth at the lower part of the left labium, and extended gradually along the buttock, and over the os coccygis, forming a pendulous mass rather broader than the two thighs. In removing it, the anterior portion of the tumour was found to extend along the side of the vagina : it was cut off, and a portion was left behind, which again grew to a mass about one-third of the size of that which was removed. A second operation was therefore performed two years after the first; and the whole tumour being extirpated, the patient com- pletely recovered. She remains well to this time, eighteen years after the second operation. The case is related by Sir W. Lawrence, Bart., in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xvii, p. 11, London, 1832. 3027.

A Flask-shaped Fibro-cellular Tumour, pendulous from the right wall of the vagina and right nympha. xxxv. 71 The patient was 34 years old, and had noticed the disease for three or four years. It began as a tumour projecting into the vagina from beneath its external wall, and in this situation acquired a large size before it protruded externally. Its protrusion occurred ten days before its removal, and was followed by very quick enlargement, probably because of the inflammatory swelling. It was loosely connected with the surrounding tissues, and was easily removed. There was no return of the disease within two years and a half of the operation. 3029.

A large cluster of Polypoid Growths, removed from the nymphse and walls of the vagina of a child. The largest growth is of oval shape, and nearly three inches in its chief diameter ; the others are various in size and shape; some spheroidal, many pyriform, and the smallest not more than one or two lines in length. They are grouped without order; the largest is attached to the upper wall of the vagina and to the nymphae, and at its upper part is traversed by the urethra ; the others were attached to different parts of the vagina. In minute structure all appeared to be composed of very fine fibro-cellular con- nective tissue; the largest was soft, elastic, opaque-white; the others, more like gelatinous polypi of the nose, were nearly pellucid, succulent, pale-yellowish, purple-pink, and white in various shades. At birth, a growth, " like a bunch of small grapes," was observed projecting from the vulva. It appeared to be con- nected with the right wall of the vagina, and, when the child was six weeks old, was removed by ligature. It was, probably, soon reproduced, but the next growth was confined within the vagina, and did not protrude till the child was three years old. It was tied round what appeared to be its base, and sloughed457 GENERATION IN THE FEMALE. away. But a fresh growth quickly took place, and increased rapidly. The mass here shown w as excised six months after the second operation. The whole of the disease, however, could not be cut away; some was left surrounding the urethra, and from this a rapid increase took place, and destroyed life by exhaus- tion in about three months. XXXII. 66 CANCER. 3031. Part of a Vagina. An irregular warty cancerous growth projects upon its surface, and was connected with a mass of similar disease, which, origi- nating in the right kidney, made its way downward along the course of the ureter. XXXII. 60 The patient sank gradually from peritonitis and exhaustion. 3032. An Epithelioma involving the orifice of the vagina. xxxu. 61 3033. The Labia and part of the Vagina, removed by operation on account of a large mass of melanotic disease, which, arising at the front part of the vagina, encroaches equally upon either labium. xxxu, 62 3034. The Labia Pudendi, affected with cancer. They are both enlarged and indurated. In the left labium, which is the most diseased, the cancer forms an elevated, circumscribed, and superficially ulcerated swelling. xxxu. 32 They were removed from a middle-aged woman. 3035. A Labium, on the surface of which is an oval, elevated, warty growth, of moderately firm texture, and with a finely granulated surface, very similar to the chimney-sweepers' cancer of the scrotum. xxxu. 42 CYSTS. 3035a. A Cyst which was attached to the right labium by a slender pedicle. URETHRAL TUMOUR. 3036.

MYXOMATOUS DISEASE OF THE CHOBION (or so-called Hydatid Degenera- tion). 3037. Hydatid disease of the Chorion. The clusters of which it is composed verge towards a common origin at the central and upper portion of the group. The larger cysts are surrounded by others of a smaller size, either attached singly by a delicate pedicle or arranged in clusters upon their surface. A single pedicle by its numerous branches serves in many instances for the support of several vesicles. xxxiii. 20 3038. A similar specimen; with which there is also connected a thick mass of firm substance, like a decidua or placenta infiltrated with blood. xxxiii. 12 3039. A similar specimen ; a large mass formed by clusters of small pellucid cysts or vesicles singly attached to very slender branching cords. At the upper part of the specimen are portions of thin membrane, like an amnion, by which the several clusters of cysts were connected. xxxiii. 11 Presented by Dr. Conquest. 3040. A similar specimen. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 3041. Hydatid disease of the Chorion with cyst-like formations. The cord is present. The embryo has disappeared. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. 3042. A similar specimen. 3043. An Ovum, in which a short small umbilical cord is shown, but in which no embryo could be found. There is hydatid disease of the chorion. xxxiii. 2 Presented by Dr. Conquest. DISEASES OF THE PLACENTA. 3044. A Placenta, which was separated from the uterus in an abortion about the middle period of gestation. Its substance is unnaturally firm, and its foetal surface is deeply and irregularly lobulated. xxxiii. 9 3045. An Ovum, which was expelled in an abortion. The decidua and chorion together form a tough, thin, coarsely-granulated layer. In the place of the placenta there appear only two distinct round masses, apparently of some firm substance, which project into the cavity of the amnion. The amnion forms a thin but dense and opaque layer of membrane lining these projections and the459 DISEASES OF THE OVUM AND ITS MEMBRANES. whole inner surface of the ovum. The umbilical cord is small and attached to one of the projections. The embryo is nearl y two inches long, and well formed ; but all its parts appear united, as if by thickening of its amnionic covering, or as if a layer of false membrane had been thinly deposited and organised on its surface, so as to envelope it with a nearly smooth covering. XXXIII. 3 3046. An Ovum, which was expelled at an early period of gestation. The foetus, about three-quarters of an inch in length and well formed, is suspended by its umbilical cord, which appears to have been unnaturally infiltrated. The placenta is large and firm, and its inner surface is deeply lobed and nodulated : a section shows a similar lobulated arrangement within it. XXXIII. 1 3047. A thick layer of Membrane which was discharged spontaneously from the inner surface of a uterus. xxxn. 29 The patient was a -woman, 30 years old. She supposed herself pregnant, but no distinct parts of an ovum could be discovered in the substance discharged. Presented by Prothero Smith, Esq. 3048. A Placenta, which is unusually large, with the membranes. It was dis- charged six weeks from the period of menstruation. The foetus has been destroyed. DETACHMENT OF THE PLACENTA. 3049. A Foetus and its Placenta, at the seventh month of gestation. Profuse haemorrhage occurred two weeks before delivery. The presentation was natural, and delivery was easily effected. The placenta was quite healthy, and wholly attached to the uterus, but the membranes were partially separated from the .body of the placenta. To this the haemorrhage was due. The woman recovered slowly, nnd suffered from phlegmasia dolens. A subsequent pregnancy was followed by a second attack of phlegmasia dolens. RETAINED PLACENTA. 3050. A Placenta, which was retained, and expelled sixteen weeks after the foetus. During a part of this time the woman went about, following her ordi- nary occupation. The usual discharge ceased for some days, but haemorrhage subsequently occurred. ABORTION. 3051. A diseased Ovum, at the seventh or eighth week of utero-gestation, showing the early formation of a mole. The decidua is distinctly seen on the outer sur- face, and the amnion on the inner surface, of the mass. The thickness of the mass, which is in several parts nearly half an inch, is probably due to the extravasation of blood among the radicles of the chorion, as shown by the section of the lower part of the preparation. xxxm. 6 Presented by Dr. Rigby. 3052. A diseased Ovum, at the ninth or tenth week of utero-gestation. The decidua is reflected, but in other respects this ovum presents nearly the con- dition shown in the preceding preparation. The quantity of extravasated blood, however, is larger, and the mass has in consequence a distinctly lobulated form. XXXIII ? 3053. Portion of a diseased Ovum, with the Umbilical Vesicle. xxxiii. 4 It was expelled from a patient who thought herself in the sixth month of her pregnnncv but m whom no enlargement of the ulerus had taken place for several weeks before the abor tion. In twenty-four hours after the expulsion of this ovum, a dead fcetus, of about four months, with its membranes complete, was expelled ; showing that the parts preserved must have belonged to another foetus which had died at a much earlier period. Presented by Dr. Rigby.460 DISEASES OF THE OVUM AND ITS MEMBRANES. 3054.

An Ovum, which was expelled in an abortion between the third and fourth months of gestation. As in the preceding specimen the placenta is very firm, and its foetal surface is deeply lobed and knotted. The foetus, about three inches long, is well formed. A bristle is passed behind the umbilical vesicle and the omphalo-meseriteric duct. Just above the duct a small body, supposed to be another foetus blighted, is attached to the membranes. xxxiii. 10 3058. A Foetus and its membranes. They were expelled without the placenta six weeks from the last menstrual period. DISEASES OF THE MEMBRANES. 3059. A mature Foetus. The upper and lower limbs are much distorted and are drawn over the back of the foetus. The right hand has only three fingers, and is connected with the left foot by a membranous band. The toes of the right foot are imperfect. Amnionic bands are seen passing in various directions. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. DISEASES AND DISPLACEMENTS OP THE UMBILICAL COED. 3060. Parts of a double Placenta, and of two Umbilical Cords which arise there- from. One of the cords is twisted into a single noose, inclosing, and strangu- lating thereby, its fellow, which was flaccid and flat when expelled. The second child was born dead two hours after the first, the noose having been pulled tight by a nurse who was attending the patient, and who was ignorant of the existence of the second cord. xxxiii. 21 Presented by Mr. Newman. 3061.

The middle of the462 DISEASES AND INJURIES INCIDENTAL TO GESTATION AND PARTURITION. left Fallopian tube is dilated by an ovum. The dilatation is laid open, and the chorion and other parts of the ovum are shown. The uterus is slightly enlarged, and its cavity is lined by a substance like decidua. There is a simple cyst in the right ovary. xxxiii. 13 Rupture of the dilated portion of the Fallopian tube took place in the seventh week of gestation, and the patient died of h«einorrhage. 3071. A similar specimen, in which, as in the preceding case, death was the result of haemorrhage from the ruptured Fallopian tube in the seventh week of gestation. The middle of the right Fallopian tube is dilated into a sac, which contains the foetus and its membranes. In one side of this sac is a small lacerated opening, through which the flocculent chorion protrudes. From this opening a gallon of blood was discharged into the cavity of the abdomen. On its other side, a large portion of the sac has been removed to display the foetus and membranes. The outermost membrane enclosing the foetus has all the characters of decidua. Besides this membrane, the amnion and chorion are distinct. The foetus and umbilical cord are also perfect. The right ovary con- tains a lai'ge corpus luteum, distinguishable by its circular form and yellowish colour. A bristle is passed through the aperture in the ovary from which the ovum escaped. There is also a large cyst in this ovary which contained a watery fluid. The cavity of the uterus is lined throughout by a perfect and thick decidua. Bristles are passed through it into the uterus. A bristle is also passed through the Fallopian tube into the dilated portion of it, which contains the foetus and its membranes. xxxiii. 14 A Drawing of the specimen is preserved, No. 519. 3072. Portion of the broad ligament of a Uterus, with the Fallopian tube and ovary. In the middle of its course the Fallopian tube is distended by the development of an embryo within it. On the surface of this part there is a small irregular aperture, through which fatal haemorrhage into the abdomen took place. The ovary is large; at its lower part is a very large corpus luteum with a central cavity. xxxiii. 15 The patient, in the seventh week of her tenth pregnancy, was suddenly seized with pain in the situation of the Fallopian tube, and signs of internal haemorrhage, and died in ten hours. Presented by Dr. Conquest. 3073. A Uterus, with the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. A foetus has been developed in the right Fallopian tube close to the uterus, and has attained a length of between three and four inches. The placenta and the several mem. branes of the ovum are well formed. The uterus is covered by coagulated blood, effused probably from the ruptured Fallopian tube. xxxiii. 16 3074. A similar specimen, in which the foetus, contained in the left Fallopian tube, is yet further developed, and measm*es between five and six inches in length.

The extra- uterine foetus was pressed into the cavity of the pelvis during labour, and had to be raised in order to admit of delivery by turning of the intra-uterme foetus, which presented by the head. The patient died from exhaustion forty-five hours after delivery. The case is fully reported in the Medical Times and Gazette, July 18, 1863. FCETATION IN AN UNDEVELOPED UTERINE HORN. 3078. From a case in which death occurred in the third month of gestation. The uterus is bi-cornis ; the left horn which contained the foetus, is dilated into a sac. On one side of this sac is a lacerated opening, through which the foetus escaped into the cavity of the abdomen, and to the edges of which the membranes of the foetus remain attached. The left ovary contains a corpus luteum. The cavity of the right uterine horn is lined by decidua. xxxni. 18 Presented by Dr. Bull. CANCEROUS AND OTHER TUMOURS COMPLICATING PREGNANCY. 3079. A Uterus and Vagina laid open from behind, from a woman, aged 40, who had previously borne ten or twelve children. A large oval tumour is attached by a broad pedicle to the anterior lip of the uterus. The tumour was tolerably firm upon the surface, but towards the centre it was much softer—nearly semi- fluid. In structure it is composed throughout of cells having all the characters of those of cancer. The immediate cause of death was haemorrhage, which had occurred at intervals for three or four months previonsly. In the uterus is a foetus four or five months old. 3080. A multilocular Ovarian Cyst from a woman, aged 39. During the fifth month of her pregnancy it burst spontaneously into the peritoneal cavity, causing intense pain, incessant vomiting, and hiccup. She died ten days after, apparently from collapse rather than peritonitis; scarcely a trace of inflamma- tion was discovered after death. A healthy foetus was removed from the uterus. The woman had previously borne six children. xxxi. 29 Presented by Mr. Nicholson. MORBID PARTURITION. LACERATION OF THE CERVIX UTERI. 3081. A Uterus, the neck of which was torn through two-thirds of its circum- ference, during parturition. xxxil. 47 The child, in this case, was born with hydrocephalus. Its skeleton is in the Museum. Death ensued shortly after the rupture of the uterus. Presented by Dr. Conquest. LACERATION OF THE VAGINA. 3082. A semi-circular laceration is seen passing across the posterior surface of the Vagina, near the cervix uteri. Ca3e of Dr. Jainieson brought before the Obstetrical Society of Edinburgh, 1872.

Other smaller lacerations of the mncous membrane of the vagina are seen on its sides. A band of lymph extends from the vagina to the rectum. xxxn. 45 The patient was a woman, 25 years old. In two previous labours she had been delivered with the help of instruments. The laceration here sbown occurred twenty-eight hours from the commencement of her third labour. She was again delivered with the help of instruments. Peritonitis followed, from which she gradually sank. The case is described by Mr. Birch, in the Medico-Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xiii, p. 357. London, 1827. 3085. An Ovarian Cyst, which had protruded through the external parts by rupture of the vagina during labour, and was afterwards removed by ligature, with success. xxxi. 34 This case is related by Mr. Brewer in the Obstetrical Society's Transactions, vol. xx, p. 184.

A Vagina and Rectum, with the external organs of generation. The whole circumference of the uterine extremity of the vagina is soft and floccalent, having sloughed in consequence of the long-continued compression, between the head of the child and the brim of the pelvis, to which it was sub- jected during a tedious parturition. xxxn. 43 Presented by Dr. Conquest. VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. 3088. A Uterus, with the upper part of the Vagina, and the urinary bladder. In consequence of injury received in parturition, a large oval communication exists between the vagina and the neck of the bladder. The margins of the opening in the bladder are close to the orifices of the ureters, through which bristles are passed. The os uteri is obliterated. xxxn. 44 3089. A Large Vesico-vaginal Fistula.

A Uterus, with the ovaries and their ligaments. Springing from the os and cervix uteri, there is a large excavated irregularly ulcerated mass of epithelioma. In the front wall of the uterus is a vertical depressed scar. From a woman, aged 27, who during her fourth pregnancy was admitted into the Hospital with extensive epithelial cancer of the cervix uteri. At the end of the eighth month of her pregnancy Caesarian section was performed. The operation wound quickly healed, and her general health improved, as did also the local disease. Subsequently the disease assumed rapid progress, and she died of exhaustion eighteen months after the operation.—See Medical Times and Gazette, April 6, 1866, p. 362. INVERSION OF THE UTERUS. 3092. A Uterus, which was removed by the ecraseur, from a woman, 28 years of age, on account of inversion of three years' duration.

The following pelves, showing slight obliquity, produced by lateral curvature of the spine, are called scoliotic—-See Nos. 272 and 273 in Series I, and Nos. 1115, 1116, and 1119 in Series V. N.B.—There is no kypho-scoliotic pelvis in the collection. 3130. Spondylolisthesis. In this deformity the lowest lumbar vertebra is dislo- cated forwards on the sacrum, and encroaches on the brim. From a case described by Kwisch, &c, in Scanzoni's Beitrage zur Qeburtshulfe. Band iii, 1857. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. N B.—There is no specimen of spondylolizema in the collection. In it the deformity resembles spondylolisthesis, but arises from collapse of the vertebral column caused by the disappearance of the body of a vertebra. 3131. A female Pelvis. The left os innominatum is much smaller, thinner, and lighter than the right, apparently in consequence of impaired usefulness of the left leg. The pelvis is slightly oblique, and the outlet somewhat contracted. The left common iliac artery and its branches are much smaller than those on the right side. The head of the left femur lies in the acetabulum ; its external surface is smooth and expanded from attrition against the upper end of the shaft. Probably separation of the upper epiphysis took place at an early period of life. 3132a. A Pelvis, with anchylosed right Hip-Joint.

Portion of a Mammary Gland, in which is imbedded a simple thin-walled cyst with a smooth and polished internal surface. The cyst was filled with a clear fluid. XXXIV- 3 3143. A Cyst (galactocele) removed from a "breast in which it lay deep within or behind the mammary gland. It was of nearly spherical shape, thin-walled, and loosely connected with the adjacent parts ; its inner surface, now everted, is nearly smooth, polished, and of a pale brown colour. Some small portions of a white, fatty substance, like spermaceti, adhere to it. xxxiv. 31 3144. The quarter part of the contents of the Cyst last described; viz., about three ounces of a creamy, pale fawn-coloured liquid, with small white particles floating in it. It resembles the fluid contents of certain sebaceous cysts. xxxiv. 32 3145. A Cyst, the contents of which resembled inspissated milk (galactocele). It was removed from the mammary gland of a young woman, where it had existed for eighteen months without any material augmentation of its size. xxxiv. 33 3146. A portion of a Breast, removed by operation, showing a smooth-walled cyst of the size of a hazel-nut, which contained a serous fluid. The gland tissue in which the cyst lies is tough and fibrous, but otherwise appears normal. Microscopic Examination—The cyst was immediately surrounded by fibrous tissue contain- ing at intervals slit-like and tri-radiate cavities lined with epithelium (ill-developed gland- tlSThe parts were removed from a lady, aged 39 years ; she had noticed a lump in the breast for nine months. No fluctuation could be detected over the cyst. Presented by G-. W. Callender, Esq. PROLIFEROUS CYSTS. 3147. A Proliferous Cyst of the Mammary Gland. The cyst was as large as a small orange, and contained a yellowish-brown fluid; part of its outer surface was adherent to the under surface of the mammary gland, the other part to the skin in the neighbourhood of the nipple. The wall of the cyst is tough and fibrous its inner surface is stained of a yellowish-brown colour ; at one point a small compressed orifice is seen like that of a dilated duct. That part of the wall which was adherent to the skin is thinned and dilated into a pouch, from the inner surface of which a papillated growth sprouts: on the outer surface, which was adherent to the skin, two small secondary cysts, nearly as large as471 DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. hazel-nuts, are seen, also a small mass formed of an agglomeration of minute cysts. The mammary gland is extremely atrophied, and the gland tissue, which is tough and fibrous, is spread out in a thin layer beneath the skin. Ine nipple is retracted. Microscopic Examination.—The proliferations are composed of an imitation of gland tissue consisting of tubules, and cylinders irregularly arranged and lined with indistinct columnar epithelium. The gland tissue of the breast consists of atrophied and compressed acini im- bedded in a large amount of fibrous tissue. . . From a woman, aged 46 years. The breast had been enlarging for three years, wlthout pain. The cyst occupied the outer side of the breast. After the birth of her last child she had abscesses in this breast, which left an induration. Five or six years later a sero-san- guineous discharge took place from the nipple and has since appeared at every catameniai period. — See Sitioell Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 34. Microscopic section, No. 134. 3148. Part of a Breast, in which a cyst, with rather thick tough walls, is imbedded in the mammary gland. A rough lobulated mass of soft substance has grown from a portion of the inner wall of the cyst: the rest of its cavity was filled with serous fluid. xxxiv. 7 The proliferations resemble microscopically those in the preceding specimen.—See micro- scopic section, No. 135, and a drawing, A. 45. 3149. A Breast removed from a middle-aged woman. The situation of the mammary gland is occupied by a large cyst, which contained a serous fluid, and around which the gland is spread out. The walls of the cyst are about a line in thickness, tough, but pliant: its interior is irregularly wrinkled, and somewhat sacculated; a small soft lobulated growth projects from a portion of its wall into its cavity. Above this cyst (at the part of the mammary gland which, during life, lay near the axilla) is a small oval mass of firm new growth, with irregular cavities, the result, apparently, of its partial softening. xxxiv. 16 Under the microscope the proliferous growth consists of areolar tissue containing alveoli filled with cells of the epithelial type.—Microscopic sections, No. 136, were preserved. The patient died, some time after the removal of the breast, with a return of the disease. 3150. A Breast, with two cysts imbedded in the mammary gland. The walls of the cysts are thin and tough ; their inner surfaces are coarsely wrinkled ; and they communicate by a small aperture. The interior of the smaller cyst is rust-coloured. The larger cyst was distended by a watery fluid, and a lobulated growth of soft substance has arisen from a part of its inner wall. xxxiv. 1 The proliferous growth resembles microscopically that in the preceding specimen. 3151. A Breast, in which a Cyst is imbedded in the mammary gland. The cyst has the same general characters as those in Nos. 3142, 3149, and 3150, but its cavity is almost filled by a soft, lobulated, and vascular growth attached by a broad base to a large portion of its wall. It is loosely connected with the adjacent parts. The mammary gland is very small. XXKIY. 21 Microscopically the intra-cystic growth closely resembles Nos. 3147 and 3148. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 137. A drawing of the tumour is preserved, No. 521. The breast was removed from a woman, 49 years old. The cyst had been increasing slowly and with very little pain for between four and five years. She recovered from the operation. SERO-CYSTIC DISEASE. 3152. Part of a Mammary Tumour containing numerous cysts, many of which are filled with solid growths. xxxiv. 34 3153. A portion of a Sero-cystic Tumour of the Breast. On the surface of the section a large cyst is seen almost filled up by an intra-cystic growth. A section of a portion of one of the intra-cystic growths showed that it consists entirely of fibrous tissue.—See microscopic sections, No. 138.DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. 472 The disease occurred in a woman, aged 66 years, and had existed for twelve years, durir.g the the last six months of which it had rapidly increased from the size of a fist to that of a child's head. 3154. A Mammary Gland, with two tumours imbedded in it, which were removed by operation. Each tumour is circumscribed and surrounded by a distinct capsule of cellular tissue. The substance of each tumour appears to consist of separate portions loosely connected by cellular tissue, which in the recent state resembled the lobules of the pancreas. The arrangement of the lobules indicates that they are growths (such as are in Nos. 3148 and 3150) which have arisen from the walls of numerous cysts, and have now filled thair cavities, become firm, and coalesced with the cyst-walls so as to form a nearly solid mass. xxxiv. 11 3155. Section of a woman's Breast, and of a Tumour seven pounds in weight, of which a part protruded through the ulcerated skin. The lower part of the tumour presents a section of a large cyst, with thick soft succulent walls, which contained a pale yellowish fluid. Above this, the substance of the tumour is soft, elastic, somewhat glistening and jelly-like : the greater part of it protruded through the skin in the form of a deeply lobed and very vascular mass, the surface of which was covered by healthy-looking granulations, and appeared to be in parts skinned over. The appearance of the tumour had been altered by a ligature tied round the base of the protruded part some time before it was removed; it is from this cause that the margins of the protrusion appear to overhang so far the surface of the surrounding integuments. xxxiv. 19 The tumour is a mixed round and spindle-cell scarcoma. A drawing of the tumour is preserved, No. 522. 3156. Section of a Tumour, with part of the integuments, removed from the same patient as the specimen last described. The characters of the tumour are very like those of the more solid portions of the preceding, pale yellowish, soft, glistening, and almost gelatinous. xxxiv. 20 The patient, at the time of the second operation, was 37 years old. The tumour first removed had been growing, with very little pain, for thirteen years, and did not interfere with lactation. When, at length, it grew very large, the skin over it became livid and pointed. It was opened, and a large quantity of coffee-coloured fluid was discharged, shortly after which a solid vascular growth protruded from the opening. This growth soon attained a large size, and was cut off; it again increased, and a ligature was placed round its base, which produced so much pain that the patient came to the Hospital, and the whole mass, with nearly all the mammary gland, was removed. The patient remained well for nearly two years, when the tumour. No. 3156, appeared, and increased rapidly. She recovered, and was hi good health shortly after its removal. FIBEO-ADENOMA (Chronic Mammary Tumour, Mammary Glandular Tumour, &C). 3157. A small Fibro-Adenoma of the Breast; it was encapsuled, and the section presents an appearance of lobulation. Microscopic Examination.—The tumour consists of fibrous tissue, containing tubules of gland tissue. Eemoved from a woman, aged 31; she first noticed the lump nine months before its removal. —See Sittoell Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 62. Microscopic specimens are preserved, No. 141. 3158. A Fibro-Adenoma, very distinctly lobulated ; removed from the right breast of a girl, aged 18 years. It was discovered six months before the operation. Microscopically it consists of new-formed gland tissue imbedded in fibrous, and loose mucous tissue.—See microscopic sections, No. 142 ; and a drawing A. 39. 3159. A small Tumour removed from the Breast. It is of oval form, nodulated on its surface, and invested by cellular tissue forming a distinct capsule. It is composed of a soft, elastic, semi-transparent, glistening substance, traversed by473 DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. opaque-white undulating fibres, of which the larger appear on the section to form partitions dividing it into several round masses. xxxiv. 22 Microscopically this tumour closely resembled the preceding specimen.

A portion of a very large Tumour, which was removed with a woman's breast. It is composed of an clastic, tough, white, homogeneous substance, arranged in closely connected lobes, and formed of fine fibro-cellular tissue, with compactly and irregularly woven filaments. The whole tumour was of an oval form, and weighed seven pounds. xxxiv. 18 Microscopically the tumour consists almost entirely of fibrous tissues. The patient was between 30 and 40 years old. The tumour had been growing thirteen years, and produced little inconvenience, except by its weight. She used to sit with her breast resting on her knees, till the integuments began to slough. The mammary gland lay under the tumour, and appeared healthy. The patient recovered completely after the operation. The rest of the tumour is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. MYXOMATA, SARCOMATA, AND ADENO-SARCOMATA. 3162. Section of a Tumour, which weighed eight pounds and occupied the situa- tion of the mammary gland. The outer surface of the tumour is uneven, knobbed, and appears to have been loosely connected with the adjacent parts! Its section shows that it is composed of a light grey, semi-transparent substance, compact and glistening on the cut surface, and variously intersected by slender bundles of fibres. A few small cysts, with polished internal surfaces, are scattered in the substance of the tumour; and at the lower part of the section the cysts are filled by lobulated growths from their walls. xxxiv. 2 Microscopically the tumour consists of myxomatous tissue, containing small cyst cavities with occasional tracts of fibrous tissue.—See microscopic sections, No. 143, and a drawing Vide Nos. 3288 and 3288a in Series L. SARCOMA. 3163. Section of a Breast and of a large Tumour developed in the mammarv gland.

The cavity left by its separation ulcerated widely and deeply, assuming the characters of a great cancerous ulcer, and the patient died exhausted nine months after the removal of the tumour. Hard white tumours, of cancerous appearance, were found in the lungs. Some of them are in Series XI, 1740; and part of the patient's stomach is in Series XVII, No. 1903. Vide No. 3296, Series L. HARD OR SCIRRHOUS CANCER. 3165. Sections of a Mammary Gland and the surrounding fat, in which an irregular mass of scirrhous cancer is embedded. The morbid structure presents a very hard, dull greyish basis, intersected by short bands, like fibres interwoven in a close irregular network. Some of these bands have a yellowish aspect, and on the surface of the lower section portions of the adipose tissue of the breast are seen enclosed within the cancerous substance. A few small cysts also are contained within it. The surface of the morbid structure is in- timately adherent to the surrounding tissues, and, at one part, can scarcely be distinguished from them. xxxiv. 4 The patient was 63 years old. Her mother, sister, and another relative had died with cancer of the breast. She died four days after the operation, with abscess under the sterno-mastoid muscle. Parts of a large cyst in one of her ovaries are preserved in Series XLI, Nos. 2917, 2918, 2919. 3166. A Tumour, with a portion of skin, removed from a breast. The tumour is nearly spherical, and appears to have been slightly connected with the surrounding parts. It is of pale, firm, and uniformly close texture, and is in- tersected by fine undulating fibres, like partitions, imperfectly dividing it into lobes. XXXIV- 5 Microscopically it presents the ordinary structure of scirrhous cancer.—See microscopic sections No. 149 ; and a drawing, A. 51. Presented by Dr. Conquest. 3167. Sections of a Tumour removed from the breast of an old woman. Its microscopic structure is that of a scirrhous cancer. xxxiv. 8 It had grown very slowly.—See microscopic section, No. 150. 3168. Section of a Breast and of a large Hard Cancer imbedded in it. The nipple is retracted to the surface of the tumour, and appears sunk in a deep pit in the integuments of the breast. The cancerous structure exhibits a pale dull-greyish basis, intersected in every direction by short wavy lines, like bundles of white fibres, which mingle together in a close irregular network. This fibrous structure is most distinct about the centre of the mass ; its exterior appears more homogeneous: its whole substance was almost incompressibly hard. The surface of the tumour is closely united to the surrounding tissues: its outline is irregular, small lobes extending from its surface into the adjacent fat. • . XXXIV- 14 From a woman 60 years old. 3169. Part of a Breast, in which the mammary gland contains two distinct tumours. One is a small round circumscribed mass, separated by a distinct capsule from the surrounding tissues, and consisting of a firm, elastic, pale substance, with white undulating lines forming imperfect partitions in it. At one portion also it presents the appearance of lobulated growths, filling small cysts, as in Nos. 3154 and 3162. The other tumour is a smaller and rather flattened mass, intimately united to the parts around it, very hard, greyish, densely and intricately interwoven with fibres. xxxiv. 17 The patient was a woman, 42 years old. The first described, fibro-cellular, tumour (? adenoma), had existed four years; the other, a hard cancer, had existed four months, and was growing slowly to the time of the removal of the breast. 3170. Section of a Breast and of a small Hard Cancer situated just below theDISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. 475 nipple The part of the tumour nearest to the skin has softened, and exhibits on its section a small irregular cavity which was full of grumous semifluid substance. There are smaller and less completely softened spots m other parts of the growth. The skin and other tissues are healthy; but the nipple is retracted. SXXIT' 12 From a lady, between 40 and 50 years old. The disease returned before the wound of the operation had completely healed. 3171. Section of a Scirrhous Cancer of the whole mammary gland from a man. The cancer forms an irregular, rounded mass, nearly two inches in diameter; it is intensely hard, pale-greyish, with branching white lines and small yellow spots. It has extended to that part of the skin which is stretched tensely over it, and to the nipple, which is depressed and enlarged on the centre of its surface. At its deepest part fibres of the great pectoral muscle are included in its substance. XXXIV. 26 The patient was 48 years old, of healthy aspect. He had observed the disease for six months. It had increased quickly, and had been painful for two months. Two axillary glands u ore similarly diseased, and were removed with the breast. The patient recovered from the operation. A drawing (No. 529) shows the appearance of the disease when recent. 3172. Scirrhous Cancer of the mammary gland from, a man. The disease presents nearly the same characters as in the specimen last described, but is less extensive. The skin over the cancer is excoriated, and the nipple is retracted. xxxiv. 27 The patient was 45 years old, and the disease had been observed in progress for about thirteen months before his death. He had extensive cancerous formations in the spine and other bones. Part of his spine is in Series V, No. 1131. 3173. Sections of a Mammary Gland, the whole of which is occupied by Scirrhous Cancer. In the upper specimen one half of the gland is shown dissected from the parts around it; in the lower, the other half is embedded in the surrounding fat. The former specimen shows that the shape of the gland is retained, even while its structures, with the exception of little more than its larger ducts, are replaced by cancer structures forming an intensely hard and compact substance. The latter specimen shows, especially, the deep retraction of the cancerous nipple, the small size of the cancerous mammary gland, the branchings oi its larger ducts, and the abundant fat around them. xxxiv. 30 The patient was about 50 years old. The disease had probably been in progress for about six months before its removal. It recurred in two years and three quarters, and she died rather more than three yoars after the operation. 3174. Section of a Mammary Gland, with a well-marked example of rapidly grow- ing Scirrhous Cancer. The whole breast appears to have been large. The can- cerous mass, of large size and oval form, occupies the greater part of the gland, and is imbedded in the surface of the pectoral muscle. The section of the cancer shows a texture muck less compact and dense than that of the preceding specimen, and varied in aspect by the intermingling of the white lobed portions of the mammary gland, involved in the cancerous infiltration. A. section of a similarly cancerous lymphatic gland is suspended above the section of the breast. xxxiv. 29 3175. Scirrhous Cancer of the right Mammary Gland removed from a man, aged 62 years. It had existed for twelve months. Five or six enlarged and indurated glands, in which, however, no cancer structure could be detected, were at the same time removed from the axilla. The tumour forms a circumscribed oval mass surrounded by adipose tissue. 3176. Ulcerated Scirrhous Cancer of the left male Breast, removed from a man,476 DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. aged 41. The disease had existed eighteen months. Some large cancerous glands were removed from the corresponding axilla. xxxrv". 35 3177. A Scirrhous Cancer of the Breast, in which after the disease had been six or more years in progress, and had ulcerated and protruded through the integu- ments, it ceased to increase, shrivelled, and partially healed. It appears now as a dry lobed mass closely fixed to the ribs and intercostal muscles. Presented by Mr. Sturt. 3178. A portion of a Hard Cancer of the Breast. On the surface of the section the orifices of dilated ducts are seen; some of them are of considerable size. They are imbedded in a firm fibrous material. Worm-like masses of a curdy material could be squeezed from the ducts in the recent state. Microscopical Examination.—The tumour is made up of fibrous tissue, mucb less formed and dense than iu ordinary scirrhous cancer. Everywhere dilated ducts are seen ; the smaller can in some places be traced, dividing and opening into dilated alveoli, which as well as the smaller ducts, contain a yellowish granular material, which does not stain with nuematoxylon. A few acini of nearly normal size, and containing a few nuclei irregularly scattered m their interior, are seen, and from this every transition to extreme dilatation is seen. Nuclei are m some cases thickly grouped in the lymph spaces around the acini, and large groups ot nuclei having a similar appearance are met with in the substance of the tumour. History.—From a woman, aged 45. The tumour was first noticed three months ago, when it was half its present size. It has been growing quickly without much pam. Her lather s mother died of cancer.—See Lawrence Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 346. 3179. Section of a Scirrhous Cancer in a woman's breast. The cancer structures occupy the whole mammary gland, and much of the skin over it; and protrude through the skin with a deeply ulcerated surface. The section through the substance of the cancer shows a firm, close-textured, white substance, well defined, intersected by short branching white lines, and dotted with what appear to be orifices of lactiferous tubes filled with a yellowish material. The ulcerated surface is deeply and unequally excavated, and coarsely nodular; its border is elevated, slightly everted, sinuous, and, in part, surrounded by nodules of the cancerous substance, elevating and thinning the adjacent skm. xxxv. 98 The patient was 50 years old when the disease commenced. After nearly two years of pain- less progress and four months of ulceration, it was removed with the breast, and some diseased axillary°glands. Within three months after the operation small cancerous tubercles began to form in the skin about the scar, and in twenty months the patient died. 3180. A Scirrhous Cancer of the Breast. The skin and surrounding gland and cellular tissue have been separated from the tumour, which is of an irregular disc shape and of extreme hardness. The tumour is composed of a dense fibrous tissue in the centre of which is an oval nodule about the size of a small chesnut, and as hard as bone ; a distinct line of separation is seen between it and the surrounding growth. Imbedded in the very dense fibroid tissue of which the nodule is formed are numerous large granules and conglomerations of calcareous matter, which caused it to cut like bone. The microscopic characters of the tumour were those of scirrhous cancer; the cells were very abundant The central part of the calcareous nodule was composed of a dense fibrous tissue, containing no cellular elements; towards the periphery the characters more and more approached those of the surrounding tumour. ( From a woman, aged 54 years, who had noticed the tumour six weeks before applying for advice • during that time it grew considerably. It presented the ordinary characters of scirrhous cancer. She had noticed some small lumps m the breast smce she was fifteen years 0f age—See Stanley Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 52, 1878. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 151. 3181. A sloughing Cancerous Mass from the Breast of a woman, aged 59 years,DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. 477 in whom it had existed for two years. The skm over the breast was fust destroyed by acid pernitrate of mercnry; and chloride of zinc was ^erwards applied to the substance of the cancer at intervals of a day or two. The whole process lasted about a fortnight, and the slough (preserved) was separated four weeks after the first application of the caustic. Vide No. 3330, Series L. SOFT OR MEDULLARY CANCER. 3182. Section of a Breast, showing a cyst immediately beneath the nipple, which contained pus. The lining membrane was injected; springing from it are some ragged proliferations. The cyst is encircled by new-growth, which in some parts attains a thickness of an inch. The axillary glands were enlarged, hard, and infiltrated. Microscopic Examination—T\\e new-growth around the cyst and the proliferations have the structure of soft cancer. From a woman, aged 39 years. Eighteen months before her admission to the Hospital, she noticed a lump in the breast as large as a walnut, which gradually increased in size. On admission the breast was occupied by a soft, fluctuating swelling, from which ten ounces of sero-sanguineous fluid were evacuated by a trocar. No solid growth could be detected before the removal of the fluid. Suppuration in the cyst subsequently took place and the breast was removed.—See President Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 222. 3183. Part of a Mammary Gland, including a section of a tumour imbedded in its substance. The tumour is oval, circumscribed, and closely connected with the substance of the gland, though sepai^able from it, and invested with a thin capsule. Its consistence is firm and tough; its cut surface smooth, uniform, with, no appearance of lobes, or fibres, or other distinct texture ; in the recent state, greyish, with a yellowish-green tinge, and in parts suffused with a deep crimson, bloody hue. Its minute structures were, partly, cells with large clear nuclei, like those of medullary cancer, and, partly, many-nucleated oval, flask- shaped, and other bodies. xxxv. 10 The patient was 45 years old. The tumour had been observed for four months. She recovered favourably from the operation for its removal; but, five years afterwards, scirrhous cancer began to form in the part of the breast left in the operation. (A sister of the patient was, at the same time, in the Hospital with scirrhous cancer of the breast.) In a second opera- tion the cancer and all that remained of thebreast were removed ; and the patient continued free from apparent disease for nearly two years, when a tumour began to form in the other (right) breast. This being removed was found to be a growth, like the specimen here pre- served, except in that it had a large central cavity filled with blood-coloured fluid. The woman was in good health six years after the last operation. 3184. A Tumour removed from a Breast.

The tumour is suspended by the nipple which formed its pedicle. It is composed entirely of well-formed fibrous tissue; and the surface is covered by epi- thelium. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 154. Presented by Dr. Harbinson, of Lancaster. SEBACEOUS CYST ON THE SURFACE OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. 3188. Section of a Sebaceous Cyst filled with firm sebaceous material, which was removed from the breast of a woman. The cyst is covered by a portion of skin which is closely adherent to it. Before removal the cyst was supposed to be a solid new growth. There were several sebaceous cysts on the scalp, and one or two on different parts of the body.SEEIES XLIX. ANATOMY OF STUMPS AFTER AMPUTATION OF LIMBS. CONDITIONS OF THE BONES OF STUMPS. CLOSURE OF THE MEDULLARY CANAL. 3189. Portion of a Femur from a Stump. The medullary cavity is completely closed, and there are two pointed processes of bone which extend upwards from the posterior part of the end of the femur and probably afforded attachment to the flexor muscles. 3190. The Stumps of a Tibia and Fibula after amputation just below the knee. Their medullary cavities are nearly closed by a layer of bone, and they are scarcely reduced in size ; but their texture is very light and greasy. A. 159 After the amputation the stump healed; but it ulcerated afresh as often as the patient returned to his work : a second amputation was therefore performed, and the patient did well. 3191. Section of a Tibia from a Stump, exhibiting the reparative changes which have taken place in the sawn end of the bone. The medullary cavity is closed by a thin layer of new bone, and other thin osseous deposits are formed around the end of the stump. i. 120 3192. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula from a Stump. At the extremity of each bone the medullary cavity is completely closed by new bone; and a bridge of new bone extends between the tibia and fibula, uniting them firmly together. I. 122 3193. The greater portion of the left Tibia and Fibula of a woman, aged 35. The two bones are joined by an intermediate portion of new bone at their lower ends. For some distance above this, the surfaces, especially that of the fibula, are roughened by the deposition of new bone, the most abundant of these deposits corresponding to the situaton of ulcers in the soft parts. Both bones are lighter than natural, the compact wall being reduced in thickness. The leg was amputated, in the first instance inits lower third, for disease of the ankle joint, the stump progressed very favourably for a few weeks, but never quite closed ; subsequently ulcera- tion commenced in the linear wound and adjacent cicatrix and very gradually extended over the extremity of the stump. Other ulcers afterwards formed higher up the limb. The general health seemed to be unaffected. All attempts to heal the ulceration having failed, a second amputation was performed just below the knee-joint by double flaps of the integu- ments. The second stump healed rapidly and completely. ADHESION OF THE TENDONS TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE BONE. 3194. A Foot, of which the toes and metatarsal bones have been amputated.480 ANATOMY OF STUMPS AFTER AMPUTATION OF LIMBS. The bones are evenly united, and the cut extremities of the tendons are firmly adherent to the bones at the extremity of the stump.—Vide Nos. 3211, 3213. ATROPHY OF THE BONES OF STUMPS. Vide Nos. 3 and 5, Series L EXCESSIVE FORMATION OF NEW BONE AROUND THE STUMP. 3195. A portion of Femur, which formed the extremity of a stump. Its lower end is enlarged, condensed, and the medullary canal is filled up; the surface is roughened by deposit of new bone, which is perforated by two small apertures leading into cavities containing necrosed bone. The patella is adherent to the extremity of the bone. Primary amputation was performed two years before the removal of the specimen. 3196. Portion of a Femur, which formed the extremity of a stump after ampu- tation of the thigh by rectangular flaps. Around the extremity there is a copious deposit of new bone. A portion appears to have been detached by an oblique fracture, drawn upwards, and subsequently anchylosed. a. 163 3197. The remaining portion of the Femur of the man from whom the preceding specimen was taken. The extremity exhibits a return of the same disease which became apparent within a few months after the last operation. The bone was removed by amputation at the hip joint, and the man died. A. 165 3198. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula from a Stump. The fibula is united to the tibia by ossification of the interosseous ligament. An irregular deposit of new bone has taken place on the external surface of both bones for a considerable distance above their extremities. 1- 144 CARIES. 3199. The upper half of the right Femur and Acetabulum of a man, aged 35, who died five weeks after amputation through the middle of thigh. The portion of the femur was bare. It has a worm-eaten appearance from ulceration, and there are considerable exfoliations partially separated. The lower portion is invested by new bone. The sawn extremity was in process of separation, and where the line of demarcation appears there is greater abundance of new bone, especially in one spot, where it forms a considerable outgrowth. The entire acetabulum is carious, and its floor is perforated. The man had been employed for many years in arsenic and copper works. The limb was removed for inflammation of the lower part of the femur. No arsenic could be detected in the diseased bone. A. 170 NECROSIS. 3200. Portion of the Shaft of a Humerus separated by exfoliation, after Necrosis following amputation. l- 164 The patient was a middle-aged man. The amputation was performed on account of a com- pound fracture. 3201. Portion of the Femur from a stump. A circle of bone at the extremity of the stamp has separated after necrosis. A considerable deposit of new bone has taken place upon the surface of the femur, and forms a thick ring above the part from which the dead portion separated. I. 155 3202. A portion of the Shaft of the right Femur in a state of necrosis, from a man ao-ed 24, whose thigh was amputated in its lower third twelve months previously, in consequence of a severe injury to the leg. The wound healed favourably, but while moving about a few weeks after the operation he fell and struck the stump. From that time the limb became painful, and the extremity481 ANATOMY OF STUMPS AFTER AMPUTATION OF LIMBS. of the bone gradually enlarged. Subsequently, fistulous apertures appeared in various parts about the extremity of the stump. A simple incision across the face of the stump exposed the end of the bone, which was seized, and the dead portion drawn out from a well-defined cavity lined with a smooth, soft, and vascular membrane. The walls, of considerable thickness, were formed of new bone. 3203. Section of a Femur from a Stump, exhibiting an irregular osseous deposit upon its surface, immediately above its extremity, which has perished. I. 142 3204.

The end of the Stump of a Humerus. r. 300 Amputation was performed, on account of an injury of the arm, when the child, from whom this specimen was taken, was about 4 years old. The stump healed without prominence of the bone, but, in about a year, the bone had grown so much more than the soft parts, and had become so prominent, that it was necessary to remove this portion, which is nearly an inch in length. 3207. A Thigh Stump in which the conditions which lead to a conical stump are seen in progress. It has been injected with carmine, and a section made through it from before backwards. The bone protrudes two or three inches beyond the flaps; its extremity is bare and dead; a fine'rim of bone has separated from the outer half. Above the dead extremity the protruding bone is covered by granulations, beneath which is a considerable heaping up of new periosteal bone (as may be seen on the surface of the section). The medullary canal is enlarged towards the extremity of the bone by the absorption of the compact tissue. The femoral vessels are dissected out. Springing from the end of the artery are a large number of adventitious vessels. The artery itself terminates in a fibro-cellular cord which is adherent to the bone • just above its termination the vessel is dilated and makes a bend; here it is filled by an organised clot, which is tunnelled and has been penetrated by the injection. The vein is plugged throughout its whole length by a firm clot It terminates m a fibro-cellular cord close to the artery; a small piece of glass is inserted between them. & aSSiiSS^ni 76 Tf 2?Vth[5h T.amPutated in the lower third for acute abscess Ol the knee-joint The end of the bone made its way through the anterior flap. to]l r, p.to^ ^ JS amPutafcion' from Phthisis—See Pitcaim Ward Book, 3208 Sections of the extremity of a Stump after amputation above the knee. The lower end of the bone protrudes nearly an inch beyond the extremity of the granulations upon the soft parts. The protruded portion and that imme- diately adjacent to it had died, and were in process of exfoliation. On the surface of the section, the line of separation between the dead and the living bone is marked by an arched layer of soft fleshy substance, like a layer of granulations, which extends across the cancellous tissue, and is continued less distinctly through the compact wall. In the upper section, the periosteum and soft parts have been separated from one side of the bone.

Ine patient subsequently recovered completely. 3209. The ends of the bones removed from the Stnmp of the Leg. The bones have coalesced and grown downwards in a pointed process abont one and a- half inches long. The mednllary canal extends nearly to the end of the process. From a boy, whose leg was amputated for an injury; about five years afterwards re- amputation was performed for conical stump, produced apparently by the growth ot tne bones without a corresponding growth of the soft parts. FORMATION OF BULBOUS ENLARGEMENTS ON NERVES AT THE EX- TREMITIES OF STUMPS. 3210. Portion of a Scapula, with the Axillary Nerves and Artery, from a person in whom amputation of the arm at the shoulder-joint had been performed a considerable time before death. The several nerves are firmly united together, and their extremities form hard bulbous sweUings, which are adherent m one mass to the cicatrix in the skin. VIIL 3211. Section of part of a Femur, with the nerves, vessels, and muscles, thirty years after amputation. The medullary cavity is closed for some way above the end of the bone. The extremities of the popliteal and peroneal nerves are united in one bulb-like enlargement, which is attached to a dense white tissue, continued from the muscle, nerves, and vessels, to the end of the bone. VIII. io 3212 Portion of a Femur, with the ischiatic, and a branch of the anterior crural, nerve attached to it; from a Stump. The ischiatic nerve presents a small bulb-like swelling at its extremity, which was united by dense cellular tissue to the integument of the stump and to the end of the bone. The branch of the anterior crural nerve presents, in relation to its size, a larger bulb at its extremity, which was united in the same manner to the end of the bone and to the integument. Between the two nerves a triangular and flat spiculum ot bone has arisen from the outer surface of the femur. vm. 9 3213. A Stump of a Leg re-amputated on account of constant pain and ulcera- tion. From a man, aged 30 years. There was marked thickening of the sheath of the musculo- cutaneous nerve, which was also in a state of tension. The nerve was traced down to an ulcer, at the extremity of the stump, where it is probable its free extremity was exposed. There are the usual bulbous enlargements of the posterior tibial and other nerves.-See Darker Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 190.SERIES L. GENERAL PATHOLOGY.* HYPERTROPHY. 3214. A Heart, showing extreme hypertrophy of the left ventricle, the wall of which is a.t one part two inches in thickness. The ventricular cavity is some- what enlarged. The mitral valves are slightly thickened: the aortic are normal: the inner cusp of the tricuspid valve is adherent to the ventricular septum, which projects into the cavity of the right ventricle. Microscopic Examination.—The muscular fibres composing the papillae and wall of the left ventricle were granular, and the striae were indistinguishable from fatty degeneration. From a blacksmith, aged 35 years, who fell down dead in the street. He had not previously complained of ill-health. The heart weighed 2 lbs. 6oz. The kidneys, brain, and other organs were healthy. The specimen is an illustration of the fatty degeneration which commonly supervenes on hypertrophy of the heart. Presented by Dr. Yarrow. 3215. A Urinary Bladder and Penis. One inch of the length of the urethra imme- diately anterior to the bulb is closely contacted. In consequence of this obstruction to the passage of urine, the bladder is hypertrophied. Its muscular coat is greatly increased in thickness, measuring about half an inch through. The muscular fasciculi on the inner surface project in strong columns or ridges, between which the mucous membrane is depressed. The mucous membrane is smooth, and though thicker than usual, is not indurated : it appears only to have acquired additional strength in correspondence with the other hyper- trophied textures of the organ. 3216. Skull of a child, about 10 years old, exhibiting enlargement of all the bones, especially the parietal and occipital, in adaptation to the enlargement of the brain by hydrocephalus. The bones are very thin and light; and the inferior occipital fossae bulge out in large rounded prominences. ATROPHY. 3217. The Skull of an old edentulous female, exhibiting atrophy of the jaw-bones and of the parts immediately connected with them, in consequence of the loss of the teeth. The alveolar margins of both jaws are completely absorbed ; so that the alveolar border of the upper jaw is nearly on a level with the surface of the hard palate, and that of the lower jaw is but just above the mental foramina bcarcely a trace of a tooth-socket can be seen; the margins of the jaw-bones *For other specimens in the Museum illustrating General Pathology, see the Table of Keferences at the commencement of the volume. 2 I 2GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 484 are rough and hard. The whole texture of both maxillary and palate bones is light, dry, and smooth-surfaced. The hard palate is, except in the median line, so thinned that it is transparent and flexible. The circumference of the lower jaw is in every way more extensive than that of the upper jaw : the surfaces of the rami and angles present scarcely a trace of the attachment of the muscles: the rami are placed obliquely, and are at an obtuse angle with the body of the jaw. There appears to be also a general diminution in thickness and weight, and probably also in the size, of all the bones of the skull; and there is a pecu- liar flattening and shelving of the frontal and parietal bones on either side of the coronal and sagital sutures. The frontal suture remains ununited, and the other sutures are open, with the exception of the middle of the sagital. 3218. Portion of a Cerebrum, with the Optic Nerves, and some remains of the Left Eye. The eye is contracted, in consequence of the escape of its humours, and the left optic nerve is atrophied from disuse. The diminution m size extends from the retina to the optic commissure. Between the commissure and the optic thalamus, the nerve on the right side is smaller than that on the left, and the right thalamus is smaller than the left. vm. 6 From a person who had been blind in the left eye, from childhood, in consequence of small- pox. FATTY DEGENERATION. 3219. Dissection of a Left Leg and Eoot, showing fatty degeneration of the muscles and talipes equino-varus as the result of paralysis. The muscles pre- serve their normal form and size, but are completely converted into fat; an indistinct striation is still visible. The change affects uniformly all the muscles of the le<r, but a small patch of normal muscular fibre is m places seen on the surface of the gastrocnemii. The foot is immovably fixed in a position ot talipes equino-varus, and the plantar fascia is contracted. From a girl, aged 17 years, both of whose legs became paralysed when she was three years old The left lei ™s smaller than the right, cold and blue, and was so cumbersome to her, that amputation was thought advisable.-See Sitwell Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 93. See also a similar specimen, No. 13 in Series I. 3220. A section of a Liver, showing fatty infiltration. The section is smooth and mottled of a yellowish-white colour, owing to the infiltration of the cells at the periphery of the lobules with fat. CALCAREOUS DEGENERATION. 3221 A Femoral Artery, converted into a rigid tube, by an almost uniform deposit of calcareous matter in its wall. The appearance of transverse striation is due to the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the middle coat, m which the deposition takes place.

The Wall, consisting of the pyogenic membrane, of a large circumscribed Abscess, removed from one of the middle lobes of a cerebrum. Its internal surface is smooth, and lined by lymph, of which some has been turned off m a layer; its external surface is covered by shreds and flocculi from the adjacent cerebral substance ; its walls are moderately tough and about half a line m thickness. VI- 60 The patient was a middle-aged man, and had had only some slight and obscure signs of disease of the brain. ULCERATION. 3233. An Ulcer of the integuments of the Leg, the base of which is adherent to the surface of the bone. 3234. Portion of an Ileum, exhibiting two ulcers of the mucous membrane. Both the ulcers extend completely round the intestine, and their margins are irregular and shreddy. XVI* ^ MORTIFICATION : DEATH OF PARTS OF THE BODY. 3235. A portion of Skin that sloughed after injury, and was separated by ulceration of the adjacent tissues. XI- 35 It illustrates the death of parts as the direct effect of mechanical force. A girl was bitten by another on the back of her hand. The piece of skin included between the teeth was not cut or apparently bruised 5 it did not become inflamed, but with the blood coagulated in its vessels, it became, in about forty-eight hours, brown and dry, and was then gradually separated. 3236 The Feet of a girl, which mortified and sloughed off after exposure to cold. appendix. 8 The patient, 19 years old, slept in the street during a cold night.

A Fatty Tumour, which had descended from the abdomen into the inguinal canal of a woman. It lay in a peritoneal sac and was connected with the interior of the abdomen by a thin band or pedicle of fibrous tissue, but with what structure is uncertain. Slight symptoms of strangulation were pro- duced, in consequence of which herniotomy was performed ; the sac was opened and the tumour removed. The patient made a good recovery. The tumour is composed of adipose and nucleated fibrous and granular connective tissue. It was pi-obably derived from the omentum.—See Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. iii, 1875.

Portion of a Fatty Tumour, which extended along the whole front of the thigh, and weighed several pounds. The tumour is divided by septa of dense connective tissue, which in places had undergone calcification, and thus large plates of bone have been formed. It was removed from an Arab Sheik. Presented by Dr. Mackie, of Alexandria. 3253. A large Fatty Tumour, containing at its lower part a large mass of bone- like tissue, probably formed by calcification of the connective tissue septa. It was removed after deatli from a man, aged 94 years, and had existed fifty years, reaching its present size thirty years before death. Presented by R. Oke Clarke, Esq. 3254. A pendulous Fatty Tumour removed after death from the upper and inner part of the thigh of a man, aged 73 years. The patient stated that it had existed as long as he could remember. A large round mass of calcified tissue is cut across at the upper part of the tumour. Presented by Alfred Winkfield, Esq. 3255. A large, flat, lobulated, Fatty Tumour, removed from the thigh.

Its base was imbedded in the sub-cutaneous fat, and it was pendulous. It has the ordinary lobed structure and general characters of its kind ; but it protruded, at its most dependent part, through the skin, and here displays its difference from a protruding cancerous growth. Its exposed lobes project but little beyond the ulcerated opening in the skin; one of them has a thin slough on it; the others are scarcely different from those that lie deeply. The edges of the ulcerated opening are thinly bevelled, inverted, partly covered with new cuticle, like those of a healing ulcer; and at part of the opening they appear united with the subjacent surface of the tumour. xxxv. 69 The patient was a stout, healthy woman, 59 years old. The tumour had been growing for seven years. OSSEOUS TUMOURS—OSTEOMATA. 3257. An Inferior Maxilla. Two symmetrical eburnated exostoses spring from the inner surface of the alveolar portion of the bone on either side of the symphisis, corresponding in position to the bicuspids and ffrst molar teeth. The markings and slight lobulations of the bony outgrowths are also more or less symmetrical. The rami of the jaw are unusually widely separated. The bone was found in a churchyard; it is evidently that of a young person, since the " wisdom " teeth have not yet appeared. Presented by Mr. Emnboll. 3258. Portions of a Tumour removed from the inferior border of the scapula. The greater part of the tumour, including all that by which it was attached to the scapula, consists of hard cancellous bone, the cells of which, formed like489 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. those of the natural bones of the skeleton, are filled with healthy looking marrow. The outer portion of the tumour consists of a layer of greyish-white transparent cartilage, like that of the foetal skeleton, investing the osseous part, and itself invested by a layer of fibrous tissue. The general form of the tumour is an irregular oval, and its surface is deeply nodulated. xxxv. 50 It was removed from a man between 20 and 30 years old. He recovered from the operation. 3259.

Part of the Falx Cerebri wi.h an isolated portion of bone imbedded in it. vi. 82 CARTILAGINOUS TUMOURS—ENCHONDROMATA. 3261. An oval Tumour as large as a goose's egg. It is composed of distinct irregularly shaped masses of cartilage, the surfaces of which are finely nodulated. The masses are united together by fine bands and filaments of delicate connective tissue. The tumour is surrounded by a definite capsule, which is firmly adherent to the cartilaginous mass; within the portion of the capsule reflected two small, firm, fibrous nodules are seen; nodules of cartilage are also attached to it by delicate threads. On section, the nodules or masses of cartilage present a uniform aspect; in some there are small patches of calcification; in others, the whole mass is calcified and extremely hard (a section of such a mass is suspended in the bottle). Connected with the capsule, several bands or stalks of connective tissue were found, on which large and small nodules of firm fibro-cellular tissue were arranged like grapes on a stalk. One of these also is suspended. Microscopic Examination.—The nodules were composed of fibro-cartilage, except those indicated in the description, which consisted of dense fibrous tissue. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 159. The tumour, which projected from the inner side of the arm, just below the axilla, was removed from a young woman, aged 29 years ; it was first noticed six years before, and was not adherent to the skin or deeper tissues. Hard masses were felt in the axilla, winch were supposed to be enlarged glands, but turned out to be masses of cartilage.—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 325. Also account of case by W. H. Cripps, Esq., Transactions of the Patho- logical Society, vol. xxxi, 1880. 3262. Section of a very soft Cartilaginous Tumour, removed from below a woman's clavicle. The tumour is irregularly oval, lobed, from three to four inches m its diameters, invested (except at the surface of the section) with a thin fibro-cellular capsule. It consists of a very soft substance, which, when recent, was yellow and pale reel, viscid and flickering, but is now nearly pure white, and floats out in the alcohol, like the flocculi of mucus. On microscopic examination, it yielded cartilage structures, and a peculiar filamentous tissue. xxxv. 101 The patient was 45 years old. Her mother died with hard cancer of the breast. This tumour had been increasing without pain for eight years, was sub-cutaneous and movable Another tumour, probably of the same nature, was fixed to the right frontal eminence. In the six months following the operation, she had no return of disease ; neither did the tumour on the forehead increase.

Within each lobule there is a nearly spherical fibrous tumour, over which the integument is tightly stretched. A section of one of the tumours displays a dense pale fibrous texture. Above these is a small tumour of the same kind, which was reproduced in the cicatrix formed after the excision of one of the lobules. xxxv. 24 The tumours began to grow shortly after the patient took to wearing ear-rings. The tumour last-mentioned was removed a few months after its first appearance. Presented by J. H. Holberton, Esq. 3265. Two fibrous Tumours which grew in the lobules of the ears of a young woman who had worn ear-rings. They were removed about two years after the ears had been pierced. 3266. Two Tumours of a fibrous structure, removed from the lobules of the ear of a woman, aged 25 years, where they had grown from the time that the lobules had been perforated for ear-rings. 3267. Portion of Skin, showing an oval raised growth, composed of tough fibrous tissue, like cicatricial tissue, which formed in the scar of a burn. xi. 32 3268. A dense fibrous Tumour, removed from the front surface of the thigh, where it lay imbedded in the rectus of a woman, aged 23 years. It had existed twelve years. 3269. Section of a Foot and of a large fibrous Tumour, which occupies nearly the whole of the sole, and is attached to the periosteum of the bones of the tarsus and metatarsus. It consists of a very firm, pale, yellowish substance, intersected by wavy white fibres and bands. xxxv. 9 The tumour was removed from a nobleman, 35 years old. An enlargement of the sole had been observed thirty years. Numerous unsuccessfid attempts were made by Mr. Pott, Mr. Hunter, and others, to reduce its size. Its great weight and the pain attendant on the latter periods of its growth at length induced the patient to submit to its removal. Amputation of the foot was performed by Mr. Langstaff, and the patient recovered. The other half of the foot is in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England. Presented by George Langstaff, Esq. 3270. A " painful subcutaneous Tumour," removed from the outer side of the ankle of a young woman. It is of cartilaginous hardness, and was found on microscopic examination to consist entirely of fibrous tissue, arranged in irregu- larly interlacing fasciculi. Its presence occasioned considerable pain. Microscopic specimens are preserved, No. 160. 3271 Portion of Skin from a Leg. A small circumscribed oval tumour is imbedded in the subcutaneous fat, and is fixed to the inner surface of the cutis.

The tumour bad been growing for fourteen years, and for some time he had lost sensation in the lower lip. It was mistaken for a salivary calculus. Ine growth recurred soon after removal, and the patient died from the extension of the disease.— See Henry Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 20. 3275. A Tumour, removed from the back of a man, aged 56 years, where it had been growing for twenty-five years. The greater portion of its substance is composed of fibrous tissue ; but it was very vascular and contained numerous large and freely communicating blood-vessels. When recent its section presented a reddish colour. 3276. A lobulated, turgid-looking, painless Tumour, about three and a half inches long, involving the skin of the front of the thigh. The section is soft, translu- cent,' and homogeneous. The under surface of the growth is also lobulated and distinctly separated from the subcutaneous tissue, the tumour apparently origi- nating in the corium. Microscopically it consisted of loose reticular connective tissue, generally well developed, but in places containing many nuclei. The tumour was removed from the upper third of the thigh of a young lady, aged 19 years, It had existed thirteen or fourteen years, and first appeared as a small stain like a naevus. Its growth was at first very slow, but rapid during the last year. A microscopic section is preserved, No. 161. Presented by Thomas Smith, Esq. 3277. Section of a Tumour, with a portion of Skin, removed from the front of the abdomen. The tumour consists of a uniform pale firm substance, which contained a large quantity of highly albuminous fluid. xxxv. 20 3278. A Tumour removed from the front of the thigh. It was very loosely imbedded in the tissue between the vastus internus muscle and the femur. A complete membranous sac invests it. Before its immersion in spirit it had a yellow colour. It consists throughout of a firm yellowish substance, closely intersected by tough white bands. Its chemical composition was chiefly albumen, with a very small proportion of oily matter. xxxv. 33 The patient was a man, 59 years old. The tumour had grown slowly. He died shortly after the operation, and no similar disease was found in any otber part of his body. 3279. A pedunculated Tumour, composed of soft fibrous tissue, the meshes of which contained serous fluid. 3280. A pedunculated fibro-cellular Tumour, removed from the lumbar region of a man, aged 54. XI. 53 The tumour had been growing for about fourteen years, and had very gradually increased until two or three weeks before removal, when it was said to have increased much more rapidly.

Sections of a Tumour, removed from the front of a man's abdomen. It, was covered by thin vascular skin, and was nearly pendulous. It has a some- what oval form, and measures from an inch and a half to two inches in its492 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. several diameters : its surface is slightly nodulated. Its texture is uniformly firm, compact, pale, with an obscurely fibrous appearance, and with many minute cysts imbedded in it, which contained a yellow fluid : it is invested by a thin capsule. With the microscope it appeared to be composed of fine fibro- cellular tissue, interwoven among minute, pale corpuscles, and containing no fat. xxxv. 44 The patient was 28 years old. He had no return of the disease. 3283. A Fibroma (false neuroma), which was removed from the sheath of the ulnar nerve. The tumour is about four inches long and two and a half broad. The surface is smooth and undulating; attached to one extremity is a partially- detached lobule. It is composed of a soft, white, homogeneous, almost semi- gelatinous substance. Microscopic examination showed a delicate fibrous tissue formed of wavy bands, containing abundant small round and spindle-shaped nuclei. The tumour was removed from the axilla of a gentleman, aged 60. It lay in a capsule con- nected with the sheath of the ulna nerve. It had been growing for nineteen years. Some numbness of the ring and little fingers existed immediately after the operation, but ultimately passed off. A microscopical specimen is preserved, No. 162. Presented by T. Smith, Esq. 3284. An anterior Crural Nerve from a Stump. The extremity of the nerve forms a hard bulbous swelling, into which the section of the nerve shows that its component fasciculi are continued. vm. 2 FIBROUS TUMOURS CONTAINING- CARTILAGE AND BONE.1 3285. Part of a fibro-cellular Tumour, removed from a thigh. A portion of this tumour is invested with a thin layer of cancellous bone, and small nodules of cartilage are placed in one of the partitions between its lobes. It appears now white, compact, and tough; but, in the recent state, looked almost gelatinous, through the quantity of greenish-yellow serous fluid infiltrated in its texture. xxxv. 72 The patient was a man, 38 years old. The tumour had been observed about five months, and lay beneath the tensor vaginae femoris, loosely connected with the surrounding parts. There was no recurrence of the disease within three years of the operation. A drawing of the tumour is preserved, No. 550. 3286. Section of a similar Tumour, removed, with the skin covering it, from the sole of a foot, with which it was connected by a comparatively narrow base. Its lobes are very distinct; it was imbedded in the subcutaneous tissue over the metatarsal bones, and some of its smaller lobes extended among the deeper- seated parts. Nodules of cartilage are set in the pliant fibro-cellular tissue of which it is composed, and which, in the recent state, was infiltrated with fluid. xxxv. 75 It was of eight years' growth, in a man 41 years old. 3287. Section of a small Tumour, of the same kind, which is completely encased in a thin layer of bone. xxxv. 74 It was removed from over the upper part of the saphena vein of a girl, and was of slow growth. MYXOMATA (Mtxo-Sarcomata). 3288. A portion of a Tumour of the Breast. The section shows a soft, glistening tissue, with occasional loculi, into which solid growths project. The tumour was found, on microscopic examination, to consist of mucous and embryonic connective tissue, containing tubules and loculi of new-formed gland tissue (myxo-adenoma).GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 493 It was removed from a woman, aged 44 years, and had been growing feutomjmn ; very rapidly .luring the last three months. The tumour was very hard, but neither adheicnt to the skin nor deeper tissues—See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 34. 3288a. An oval Tumour of the Mammary Gland, having a very distinct capsule, Which forms around the tumour a number of intercommunicating cyst cavities filled with soft proliferous nodules. The section shows a softish, somewhat gelatinous, yellowish-white tissue, containing loculi filled by one or more pro- liferous nodules. Microscopic Examination.—The substance of the tumour consists of soft spindle and round- cell sarcoma tissue, intermixed with mucous tissue, and the intra-cystic growths lor the most part of mucous tissue. The growth was removed from a lady, who had previously had two tumours removed from the same situation. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 144. Presented by T. Smith, Esq. FIBRO-MUSCULAR TUMOURS—MYOMATA. TJNSTRIPED FIBRO-MYOMATA. 3289. A Uterus, with a large Fibroid attached to the left side of the fundus. The section shows that it is composed of interlacing bundles of, apparently, fibrous tissue.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii, p. 157. 3290. A Uterus, with several large and small Fibroids attached to it, and so completely surrounding it, that the fundus is indistinguishable. The cervix is at the upper part of the specimen, and a portion of glass is inserted into the os uteri. The large fibroid at the lower part of the specimen, through which a section has been made, has undergone calcification, and is of bony consistence. From a patient, who died of intestinal obstruction, produced through strangulation of the intestine by some adhesions between it and the uterine fibroids.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. viii. 3291. A Bladder with the Prostate Gland enlarged and indurated. The chief enlargement is at the sides and anterior part of the gland; but it is irregular, so that the prostatic portion of the urethra is not only flattened, but is also turned from its regular direction by portions of the gland projecting into it. The section shows that the gland is composed of a closely textured tissue, in which small round masses or nodules lie encapsuled. xxix. 2 CALCIFICATION OF FIBRO-MYOMATA. 3292. A portion of a Uterine Fibroid, which has undergone calcification at the circumference, and also to some extent in its interior. 3293. An Oval Tumour, about the size of a hen's egg, composed almost entirely of calcareous matter lying within a soft fleshy substance, and of bony hard- ness. The microscope shows that the fleshy substance is composed of fibrous tissue, within which a considerable amount of involuntary muscular fibre in bands and patches is seen. The tumour was found lying loose in the abdominal cavity of an old woman, brought to the Hospital for dissection. The histological characters suggest, that it was a pedunculated sub-peritoneal fibroid of the uterus which had become detached. STRIPED-MYOMA. 3293a. Section of a Tumour composed of Striped Muscle and round-cell Tissue, removed from the right lumbar region. It is seven inches and a half long, and four inches and a half wide ; of uniform firm consistence and yellowish- white colour; its section presents the appearance of interlacing fasciculi of fibrous tissues, and in places small cysts are cut across. In the upper part of theGENERAL PATHOLOGY. 494 bottle the right kidney is suspended with which the tumour was in contact. The organ appears healthy, but presents on its anterior surface a concavity, over which the parenchyma is exposed, apparently by the pressure of the tumour. In histological structure, the tumour consists of striped muscle fibre for the most part arranged in fasciculi; and nodules of round-cell tissue are scattered throughout it. The individual muscle fibres are long, very narrow, distinctly striated, but the sarcolemma is indistinguishable. The specimen was taken from the body of a child, aged 15 months, who came under treatment for a swelling in the right flank, which was soft, semi-fluctuating, and about the size of a hen's egg. This tumour grew rapidly, and its increase in size was attended with loss of strength and disturbance of the digestive organs, until at last the respiratory apparatus was encroached upon. Death took place from collapse. For a further account of the case see a paper by Mr. Eve in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, 1881. Presented by E. A. Brickwell, Esq. SARCOMATA. ROUND-CELL SARCOMA. 3294. Half of a round-cell Sarcoma, from the back of a boy, aged 11 years, who had other similar tumours on different parts of the body ; one higher up on the back ; a second over one hip; a third on the front of the chest; and a tumour of each testicle. Two tumours had been previously removed from the forehead, and one from the parotid region; these had existed about three years. The tumours followed each other slowly at first, but more rapidly later. In microscopic characters all the tumours, which were removed, precisely resembled each other, including the tumours of the testes. They consisted of round cells in a fine fibrous stroma, which was much more abundant than is usual in the sarcomata. See an account of the case by Mr. Butlin, in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxx, p. 396, 1879, and Colston Ward Book, vol. v, p. 178 ; also Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. v, p. 49. A microscopic specimen of the tumour of the testicle is preserved, No. 121. 3295. Section of the lower end of a Femur. The extremity of the diaphysis is surrounded for about four inches by a sarcomatous tumour, which projects especially on the posterior surface. The tumour is almost entirely ossified and contains a few small cysts. The entire thickness of the femur was sur- rounded by the new growth; the bone is condensed and indurated, but does not appear infiltrated. The histological elements of the tumour are round and elongated cells. The specimen was taken from a young man, aged 16 years, by amputation through the thi<*h. Four months before admission to the Hospital he noticed a swelling above the left knee, which arose spontaneously. It gradually increased in size, accompanied by aching pain. —See Kenton Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 33. 3296. Sections of two Tumours. The largest tumour occupied the situation of the mammary gland: it is an oval mass, with a smooth external surface, and formed of a pale, uniformly firm substance. The smaller tumour seemed to be formed by enlargement and change of structure of the axillary lymphatic glands. It consists of the same kind of substance, but presented a distinct portion of a dark brown colour and of a very soft texture, like a mass of medullary substance with blood effused in it. The tumour was a round-celled sarcoma, having some resemblance to the lympho-sarcomata. xxxiv. 9 From a girl 16 years old. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 163. GLIOMA (Glio-Sarcoma). 3297. A Glioma of the Retina. A vertical section through the optic nerve and eyeball shows a firm growth of a white colour, commencing at the entrance of495 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. the optic nerve, and filling the greater portion of the inferior two-thirds of the vitreous chamber, the remaining third being filled with recent flocculent lymph. The cn-owtli consists of two lobes, in distinct portions, the smaller and posterior of these springing from the entrance of the optic nerve has driven the choroid before it, and perforating this has spread out into the vitreous chamber as tar forward as the posterior aspect of the lens. No trace of the retina remains. The lens was in its normal position, but has been lost. ix. oU The eye was removed from a boy, aged 10 yearn The disease had not attracted attention until seven weeks previous to the operation. LYMPHO-SAECOMA. 3298. Section of a soft brain-like Tumour, occupying the popliteal space. It is firmly attached to the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and infiltrates the substance of the hamstring muscles, but is not connected with the bones. The growth consists of very small closely-packed round cells, enclosed by trabecular of a dehcate connective tissue, having a more or less alveolar arrangement. The cells were about the size of white blood or lymph corpuscles. From a lad, aged 17 years, who was admitted to the Hospital with an elastic swelling in the popliteal space, which in its physical characters resembled a bursa. On puncture it was found to be a solid tumour, the size of a plover's egg, having the same characters as the above, and attached to the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The tumour was removed, the wound healed, and the patient left the Hospital, but returned two months after the operation with a recurrence of the growth and ulceration of the skin covering it. Amputation through the middle of the thigh was then performed. He died with a return of the disease in the pelvic and lumbar glands, a few months after the operation. The infiltrated glands were white, soft, and brain-like, and the microscopic characters of the growth exactly resembled that of the primai-y and recurrent tumours.—See Harley Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 22. Microscopic sections are preserved, Nos. 166, 167. SPINDLE-CELL SARCOMA (Recurring: Fibroid, Fibro-Plastic Tumours, &c). 3299. Section of a "recurring fibroid" Tumour (spindle-cell Sarcoma) re- moved from over a patella. It is many-lobed, and its lobes are separated by connective tissue, continuous with that which invests its whole mass. Its sub- stance is soft, uniform, close, without apparent texture ; it appears now opaque, nearly white, dimly shaded, brain-like ; but, in the recent state, was greyish and translucent, flickering like firm gelatine. Blotches of extravasated blood appear on parts of its cut surface. xxxv. 64 The patient was a healthy-looking man, 23 years old, and this was the third tumour of the kind removed from the same part. The first, which had been a year in progress, was removed in August, 1851 ; three months afterwards a second tumour appeared, which grew very quickly, and was removed in March, 1852; and two months after the healing of this second wound, this third tumour began to grow, and after seventeen months' growth was removed in November, 1853. The microscopic constituents of the growths were, a dimly-granular basis, or blastema, in which were imbedded abundant, large, clear nuclei, with nucleoli, and elongated spindle cells, with nuclei similar to those that were free. A drawing of the specimen, in its recent state, is preserved, No. 56. A fourth tumour, of the same kind and size, was removed in August, 1854, a fifth in April, 1855. 3300. Part of a "recurring fibroid" Tumour Cspindle-cell Sarcoma), removed after death from the front of a chest. It is composed of many loosely-con- nected lobes. In the recent state, it was described as of hard texture, like a fibrous tumour, yielding very little blood when cut into, but showing on its section the mouths of open vessels. After the action of spirit, it is milk-white firm, elastic, close-textured, breaking with a coarse, fibrous grain. xxxv. 80 In 1839, a tumour, which had been growing for a year over his right first rib, was removed from the patient from whom this specimen was taken. He was at the time 48 years old Two years after the operation another tumour appeared in or near the same part and was removed in 1843. A third was removed in 1847, a fourth in 1849, and a fifth in 1851. After each of the first four operations the patient recovered well, and had an interval of apparent freedom from disease. After the fifth, the wound ■ had scarcely healed when two tumours496 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. appeared beneath the scar, which were just like the preceding ones, except that they grew more rapidly. One of them was so fixed to the clavicle, that no operation could be advised. They coalesced, and continued to grow till, at the time of the patient's death, in 1852, twelve months from their first appearance, they made a mass more than a foot in diameter. In the course of their growth, the skin over them ulcerated widely ; portions of them also sloughed away, and sometimes severe haemorrhage ensued. Still, with the exception of being reduced by the bleeding and discharge, the patient's health was not deeply affected; he did not become cachectic ; he had no sign of internal disease ; and he seemed to die through mere exhaustion. In microscopic structure, the tumour .appeared almost wholly composed of elongated, slender, nucleated cells, and nuclei of similar shape. A sketch of some of these, with a further history of the case, is given in Sir J. Paget's " Lectures on Pathology," Third Edition, p. 602. Presented by Dr. Eoss. 3301. Section of part of a Leg, showing a large recnrring fibroid Tumour (spindle-cell Sarcoma), imbedded in the muscles and protruding through the skin. The tumour, irregularly spheroidal, and lobed, is partly intersected by the fascia of the leg; and above, at a part where an operation had been per- formed, appears confused with the muscles. In other parts its boundary is clear. Its protruding and cut surfaces appear soft, broken, grumous, and pale brown ; in the recent state its cut surface was milk-white, and brain-like, except where it was discoloured by effused blood. xxxv. 97 The patient was a man 60 years old. Within the five years preceding the amputation of his leg three tumours were removed from the part from which the tumour here shown proceeded. They all had the general appearance of fibrous tumours ; but microscopic examination of the last of them showed that it was chiefly composed (as, probably, the two preceding also were) of very narrow, elongated, caudate, and oat-shaped nucleated cells. The tumour here shown, though brain-like to the naked eye, had, essentially, the same microscopic structure. It was two and a-half years in progress, and amputation of the limb was made necessary by profuse haemorrhages from its protruding part. The parts, in their recent state, are shown in two drawings, Nos. 562, 563 ; and there is a further history of the case, with sketches of the minute structures of the tuniours, in Sir J. Paget's " Lectures on Pathology," Third Edition, p. 598. 3302. Part of a "fibro-nucleated" Tumour (small spindle-cell Sarcoma), removed with the surrounding integuments from a boy's fore-arm. The tumour is unequally lobed, widely out-spread between the skin and fascia, and intimately adherent to both, though distinct and separable from them. Its section is now opaque-white and brain-like ; but, in the recent state, it was smooth and shining, of stone-grey colour shaded with tints of yellow. Its texture was firm, with no distinct fibrous or other arrangement, but easily breaking and splitting in layers. The skin covering the tumour is very thin, tense, and partly ulcerated; and cord-like, branching processes, extend out- wards from it, like the puckerings of a scar. xxxv. 81 The patient was 10 years old. When he was two years of age, he received a slight wound of the fore-arm. A tumour appeared soon afterwards, increased, and was removed after two years' growth. Before the wound healed, the tumour here shown began to grow ; it increased at first slowly, but afterwards more quickly. In the operation for its removal, it was ncrossfiry to take away much of the fascia of the fore-arm and of the intermuscular septa, to which its base was closely adherent. There was no return of disease for nearly three years after the operation. A drawing (No. 587) shows the appearance of the disease before the operation ; and one of its microscopic structure, which consisted chiefly of nuclei, arranged in overlying rows in a molecular basis, is published in Sir J. Paget's " Lectures on Pathology," Third Edition, p. 607. 3303. A Tumour, with the portion of skin to which it was adherent, removed from the groin of a stout old lady. It is about the size of a hen's egg, of a pale pinkish colour, gelatinous aspect, and firm consistence. The skin covering it is thin, and at one point there is an ulceration about the size of a sixpence : the skin around the ulceration is thinned but not infiltrated. On the outer side of the tumour the skin is infiltrated and raised into a tubercular pro- minence.GENERAL PATIIOLOi.Y. 2 K 4D7 The tumour had been growing for ten years ; there were no enlarged glands. Microscopic Examination.—The growth is composed of small spindle-cells, intermixed abundantly in places with round cells. Round cells darkly stained are abundant around (he vessels, which have no proper walls. In places a transition of round cells into spindle-cells appears to be going on, and again of spiudle-cells into fibrous tissue. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 168. 3304. Section of a Foot, showing-a "recurring- fibroid" Tumour (spindle-cell Sarcoma), occupying the whole of the sole. The patient was a healthy look- ing woman, aged 30 years. A similar but smaller tumour had been removed three times previously from the sole, at intervals of about a year between each removal. The lymphatic glands were not affected. No recurrence had taken place two years after the removal of the foot. 3305. A Fibro-Sarcomatous Tumour, which grew from the buttock. Its outer surface is largely nodulated; the section presents a reticulation of glistening fibres having a cartilaginous lustre. The tumour was not connected with bone. It consisted microscopically of a matrix of fibrous tissue and spindle-cells enclosing round nuclei. The tumour was removed by operation from a lady, aged 58 years. Three years previously a similar growth had been removed from the same situation. Presented by A. Willett, Esq. 3305a. A Fore-Arm and Hand. The lower extremities of the bones of the fore- arm, and the bones of the carpus, are surrounded by a lobed and ulcerated mass of soft sarcoma. The interior of the bones appears healthy. xxxv. 8 Microscopic Examination.—The growth consists of large spindle-cells. 3306. Section of a flattened oval Tumour, removed from beneath the integu- ments of a woman's back. Its base was closely connected with the trapezius muscle, a portion of which was removed with it. The tumour is composed of four portions of unequal size, which are loosely connected by areolar tissue; and on the cut surface of each portion there is an appearance of lobular arrangement. In texture, the tumour resembles the fibrous tumours of the uterus. In the portion of integument lying over the tumour is a large cicatrix, the result of an operation by which a tumour had been previously removed from the same part. xxxv. 52 The patient was m apparently healthy woman, between 50 and 60 years old. Nine months before the removal of this tumour, one, which had been growing for about sixteen months, was removed from the same part. This was growing rapidly, and with much pain ; the skin over it was very red, and the adjacent veins were large. There was profuse hecmorrhage at the time of the operation j but the patient recovered from it, and seemed restored to health. The tumour yielded a large quantity of gelatine when boiled in water. The other half is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 3307. A Tumour, with a portion of the muscles of the thigh in which it is imbedded. _ An elliptical piece of skin is connected with the°tumour, in which there is a cicatrix, the result of a former operation for the removal of a morbid growth occupying the same situation.

It was removed from the lumbar region of a man aged 50 years, in December, 1869. The tumour recurred, and was removed in408 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. November, 1870; a second recurrent growth was removed in June, 1871; and a third in November, 1871. 3309. A large Tumour, with the surrounding skin, removed from the front of the chest of a middle-aged lady. The section of the tumour shows that it is composed of a soft but compact, pure white, brain-like medullary substance, with blood diffused through its lower half. xxxv. 28 In the course of eleven years preceding the removal of this tumour, three similar operations had been performed on the same lady. At the first operation, the part removed appeared to be a simply hvpertrophied mammary gland. At the second, a large tumour was removed from the opposite breast. At the third, a large tumour removed from the seat of one of the former operations, appeared to be partly fibrous, and partly medullary. At the fourth, the tumour above described was removed from the front of the sternum between the cicatrices ot the other operations. The effusion of blood into the lower part of this tumour was the conse- quence of its being punctured. Profuse haimorrhage occurred at the same time, and a large portion of the tumour, as the preparation shows, protruded through the wound. 3310. Sections of a Tumour, with the surrounding skin, removed from the same patient as the tumour last described, and from the situation of the cicatrices of the previous operation. The sections display the same medullary character as the preceding tumour presents, but the morbid substance is softer and more uniformly coloured with effused blood. xxxv. 29 During her recovery from this, the fifth operation, the patient died suddenly. A mass of fibrin mixed with cancerous matter was found in the pulmonary artery ; the specimen is preserved in Series VIII, No. 1564. 3311. A Tumour, removed from the pectoral region of a young man, aged 22 years, where it had existed for fourteen months. It was situated immediately behind the left mammary gland but, as the section shows, the gland is not involved, but merely carried forward by the growth of the tumour behind it. The mass was very hard, circumscribed, and prominent, but the deeper part involved the lower border of the pectoralis major muscle, a portion of which was necessarily removed with the tumour. The fibres of the muscle^ may be traced up to the tumour, with which they are connected, but in passing into the substance of the tumour, their structure is lost. The tumour appears to be composed of fibrous tissue, strong bands of which intersect it irregularly m different directions. Some of the axillary glands were slightly enlarged. MYELOID SARCOMA (Giant-Cell Sarcoma). 3312. Portion of a Lower Jaw, comprising one side of the bone from the angle to the symphisis, which was removed by operation from a young woman A soft medullary growth, originating in the interior of the bone, has caused the expansion of its surrounding walls. In the upper half of the section the morbid structure has been separated from the cavity in which it was imbedded. i. 208 Microscopically, the tumonr consists of round and spindle cells in a scanty matrix of connec- tive tissue, with myeloid cells. 3313 An Inferior Maxilla, upon which there are two nearly symmetrically placed tumours on either side of the symphisis, originating apparently within the substance of the bone. Their section is homogeneous, and of a pinkish grey colour. The substance of the tumours is ossified throughout. They were found with the microscope to be myeloid sarcomata. , The bones in Nos. 289a, 289b, 289c, Series I, were taken from the same case.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 2 k 2 4<>y MELANOTIC TUMOURS (Tumours containing Pigment). 3314. Sections of two Melanotic Tumours, which were removed from the walls of the abdomen. The lower tumour, consisting almost entirely of a soft black substance, occupied the situation of a nievns, and was removed by operation. The upper one, consisting of a pale brownish medullary substance, spotted with melanotic deposits, grew from the cicatrix formed after the removal of the other. xxxv- 18 The patient was a man, 59 years old. The first tumour seemed to have its origin in a mole, which had undergone no change from birth, till about a year before death. It then enlarged, became dark brown and firm, ulcerated superficially, and discharged foetid ichorous fluid. It was removed, together with several small dark growths whioh formed around it, and the wound healed; but in six weeks the tumour was reproduced from the cicatrix, and other small growths again formed in and beneath the skin around it, and increased in number, till m two months they amounted to at least forty, and extended from one ilium to the other, " like a large buncb of dark coloured grapes." At the same time, other tumours appeared near a mole on the sternum, and on the sides and back of the trunk, the scalp and forehead. At length, gradually increasing dyspnoea and cough came on, and were followed by general dropsy, under which the patient sank within a year from the first increase of the mole. After death, numerous melanotic growths or deposits were found in the heart (a part of which is preserved in Series VII, No. 1288), in some of the bones, in the periosteum, the mesenteric glands, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and lungs. The father of this "patient died with numerous small tumours between the shoulders ; and his children and brothers, as well as his father, had many moles on various parts of their bodies. . . , A further account of the case is given by Dr. Morris, in the Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, vol. iv, p. 437. London, 1836. Presented by Dr. Norris. 3315. Section of a Tumour, which was removed from the back of a young woman. The exterior of the tumour is lobulated, and its margin projects far beyond its base of attachment. Its surface is covered, apparently, by a thin layer of indurated skin. Its interior consists of a moderately firm, and obscurely fibrous substance, incompletely partitioned into small round masses or lobes, and is in some situations of a dark brown, in others of a black colour. At the base of the tumour, the subcutaneous fat presents small isolated portions of melanotic substance ; and many others were dispersed in the cellular tissue for some distance around. The vessels supplying this tumour were large, and bled profusely in the operation. xxxv. 23 The patient was a woman between 20 and 30 years old. The tumour had its origin in a mole or dark nsevus, but had not grown rapidly till shortly before it was removed. About two vears after the operation, she died with melanotic deposits in nearly every organ. The bones in Series I, Nos. 473 to 475 ; the dura mater, Series XXX, No. 2467 ; the portion of liver, Series XXI, No. 2213 ; the ovaries, Series XLI, No. 2928, and the mammary gland, Series XLVIII, No. 3183, were taken from the same body. 3316. Section of a Melanotic Tumour removed fiom a man's chest. The mass, imbedded in the subcutaneous tissue, is of oval shape, measuring from one and a half to three-quarters of an inch in its diameters. It is moderately firm, and lobed; in every part, deep brown shaded with black. In the fat over it are two small separate black spots, but the rest of the adjacent tissues appear healthy. xxxv. 108 The patient was about 60 years old. Eive years before the appearance of this tumour, a mole which he had on his sternum increased considerably, and was removed by ligature. Nine months after its removal, this tumour appeared, and increased gradually, and without pain. It was excised when it seemed likely to ulcerate. Six months afterwards, it was necessary to remove another tumour from near the same part; and after this operation, the patient remained well for at least eighteen months. The specimen is represented in a diagram, No. 360. Presented by George Bullen, Esq.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 500 3317. Section of a "Melanotic Tumour, removed from a female, aged 31 years. There had always been a mole in the site of the tumour, but it began to grow only two years before removal, and fourteen months later it became warty and lobulated on the surface. 3318. Section of a Melanotic Medullary Tumour, seated in a portion of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen. The growth of the tumour commenced beneath a mole, or pigmentary naevus, traces of which appear in the darkly- shaded skin which is stretched over its surface. The cancerous mass is well denned, lenticular in shape, and lobed; its cut surface is smooth, close-textured, and moderately firm. The greater part of it appears nearly pure white, and was when recent only faintly shaded with brown; the rest of its substance is more or less deeply brown or black, through the abundance of black pigment in the cancer structures, or in granules mingled with them. xxxv. 102 The patient was 44 years old. Where the tumour grew, near the umbilicus, there had been a mole from the time of birth ; but the growth had been observed for only five months. In the week after the removal of this tumour another appeared in the left breast, and in five months she died with similar tumours in nearly every organ. No. 572 is a drawing and No. 361a diagram of this specimen. GLANDULAR TUMOURS—ADENOMATA. 3319. A small Tumour removed from the breast, It has the external form and appearance of a fibro-adenoma. Its substance is tough, elastic, nearly opaque- white, appearing obscurely and very closely filamentous. There is a small smooth-walled cavity in its centre ; and it is incompletely partitioned. xxxiv. 23 The tumour consists microscopically of new-formed gland tissue, in the form of tubules and acini, imbedded in a large amount of fibrous tissue. From a married lady, 36 years old, in whom it had grown slowly, and almost without pain, for four years. A drawing of the microscopic appearances of the tumour is preserved, A 37. 3320. A small oval Tumour, having externally the appearance of a fatty tumour. It was infiltrated with calcareous material to such an extent that it could not be cut with a knife. Microscopically it is composed of convoluted columns of very small epithelial cells. _ Some of the larger columns contain a central space filled with granular material and having the appearance of the lumen of a tubular gland with a thick wall of epithelium. The tumour is probably an adenoma of a sebaceous gland. The tumour was removed from the subcutaneous tissue of the back of a young man. It had been growing for six years. His brother, his father, and a paternal aunt had subcutaneous tumours of the same description. Microscopic specimens are preserved, No. 169. WARTS.—PAPILLOMATA. 3321. A mass of Warts, removed from the skin around the anus. xi. 9 3322. A soft, papillomatous, pigmented Growth, removed from the right side of the thorax of a girl aged 13 years. It grew in the situation of a congenital mole, and during the last two years it had increased in size very rapidly. Microscopic examination showed papilla? projecting from the surface, covered with a thick layer of cuticle : there was also a slight ingrowth of epithelium from the deep stratum of the rcte Malphigii into the tissue at the base of the growth, which consisted almost entirely of small, round, indifferent cells. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 170. Presented by C. B. Gnbb, Esq.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 501 3323. A Growth springing from the skin and composed of ruddy, nodular, foliaceous papillae. The subjacent cutaneous tissue appeared infiltrated. Microscopically the papillas consist of round-celled tissue continuous with the coriura, but which does not extend to any considerable depth into it. They are covered with epithelium, the lower layers of which are columnar. The growth was removed from the back of a young woman aged 22 years. It grew from a, small warty growth which existed at birth. Seven years before admission to the hospital caustic was applied to the growth, because it had become raw and painful. It subsequently grew more rapidly.—See President Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 15. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 171. 3324. A flat, finely nodulated, sessile warty Growth, which was removed from the perineum of a gentleman, aged 35 years. He had resided in hot climates, and attributed its formation to the sweating and friction of garments, which sometimes caused intense irritation. It had been growing three years before removal. Microscopic examination showed, in addition to an increase of superficial epithelium, a con- siderable ingrowth from the deep stratum of the rete Malphigii in the form of papillary pro- cesses, containing in places "cell-nests." The growth, in fact, appeared to be in transition to epithelioma. Microscopic sections are preserved, No. 173. Presented by T. Smith, Esq. CANCERS, CARCINOMATA. EPITHELIAL CANCER, EPITHELIOMA. 3325. An Epithelioma on the under surface of the heel, an inch and a half by two inches in diameter. The surface is hard, fissured, and covered by warty papilla?; the edges are raised by thickening of the epidermis. The growth extends upwards on the inner side, and here the papillae covering the base are smaller and softer. A section shows that the base of the ulcer is formed by a softish medullary substance, which extends downwards as far as the bone and considerably beyond the edges of the growth. Examination with the microscope showed that the growth was an epithelioma. Numerous columns of cornified epithelium extended from the surface deeply into the growth. Removed by amputation from a man, aged 56 years. Eight years before admission to the Hospital he noticed a hard corn on the left heel, which ho meed to have cut every week. After a time the corn began to grow and two years ago it was removed, but recurred, and six months before admission the growth was again removed with the same result. The femoral glands were not enlarged.—See Darker Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 395. Microscopic sections are preserved, Nos. 174, 175. 3326. Sections of an Epithelioma, removed from a chimney-sweeper's neck. It forms a nearly regular conical mass, rising half an inch above the level of the surrounding skin, and covered with a laminated black scab. It bore much resemblance to a patch of rupia, except in that its base measured less than its height. Its substance within the scab is soft, friable, with mingled tints of pale brown and white. Its base rests on the subcutaneous tissue. XXXV. 99 The patient was 30 years old, and had been a sweep for twenty-seven years. The disease had existed for nine weeks. He recovered quickly from the operation and returned to his occupa- tion, but a year later had epithelial cancer of the scrotum. This also was removed, and he remained free from disease for at least two and a half years. 3327. A Hand, with part of the Fore-arm, removed on account of a growth covering nearly half the surface of the skin. The growth is warty, very vascular superficially ulcerated, with an everted sinuous mai'gin. It bears a close resem- blance to an ulcerated cancer of the scrotum in chimney-sweepers. xi. 6 The patient was 49 years old. Five years before the amputation of his hand he was employedGENERAL PATHOLOGY. 502 as a gardener in strewing soot over the ground for several morning3 in succession ; a warty growth then formed, and it increased and ulcerated in the spring of both the two following years while he was similarly employed. After this, though he was no longer in contact with soot, the disease increased till it was removed. After the operation lie completely recovered. The case is related by Sir James Earle, in his edition of Mr. Pott's works. London, 1808, vol. iii, p. 183. 3328. Sections of a Tibia, and of the muscles and integuments covering its anterior part. The lower portion exhibits part of a firm epitheliomatous ulcer, with exuberant granulations and a somewhat elevated, sinuous border, which is situated directly over a united fracture of the tibia. The upper portion, which is a transverse section of the front of the leg, shows that the cancerous disease extends from the skin through the muscles and other deeper tissues to the surface of the bone; all these parts being converted into a dense, semi- transparent substance, with obscure traces of fibres radiating towards the surface. xxxv. 40 The patient was a man, 50 years old. "When four years old, he broke his leg, and a portion of bone separated before the fracture united. The integuments over the fracture remained hard and occasionally painful till five years and a half before the amputation of the limb, when he had a blow on the diseased spot, which was followed by ulceration, and the growth of the morbid structure shown in the preparation. The case is published by Mr. Ormerod, in his Clinical Collections, p. 55. London, 1845. 3329. A large Growth, removed from the scalp of an old woman. It forms an irregularly oval mass, about five inches in its chief diameter, knobbed on its external surface, and consisting of a compact but soft and friable substance, imperfectly lobed, and presenting no appearance of definite texture. Its sur- face is rough, as if the mass were superficially ulcerated : its border overhangs to a considerable distance the integuments through which it has protruded. By its side is a cyst half an inch in diameter filled with soft, grumous, yellowish substance, like the ordinary contents of cutaneous cysts in the scalp, xxxv. 57 The patient was 80 years old. Both she and three of her children had numerous cysts, like wens, in the scalp. Two years and a half before her death one of these cysts, which had not previously appeared different from the rest, inflamed. It was opened, and sebaceous matter was discharged from it. The opening made into it did not heal, but ulcerated, and a small hard lump x'einained under the ulcer for a year, when, after erysipelas of the head, it began to grow and rather quickly increased to that shown in the preparation. Portions of its surface fre- quently sloughed, and occasionally it bled largely. Presented by James Eeid, Esq. HARD OR SCIRRHOUS CANCER. 3330. A Breast in which a hard Cancer is situated in the part of the mammary gland near the axilla. The disease forms a small, nearly globular mass, pre- senting, though less distinctly, the same characters as the preceding specimen. Above the breast, two lymphatic glands are suspended, which were removed from the axilla; they are indurated, and parts of their substance have the appearance of cancer. xxxiv. 15 From a woman 30 years old. SOFT OR MEDULLARY CANCER. 3331. Cancerous Growths, removed, with the adjacent textures, from an axilla. The principal growth filled the hollow of the axilla, and projected over its borders; smaller growths lie near the edges of this larger one. All the growths are raised above the surface of the skin, presenting rounded or lobed surfaces, which in the recent state were florid and very vascular, like those of granula- tions. The bases of most of them are narrowed ; those of the smaller growths are set in the superficial part of the cutis ; those of the larger extend more deeply, and are confused with a cluster of cancerous axillary lymphatic glands. A section of one side of the larger growth shows that it is composed of a soft, loose-textured, pinkish-white substance, which, in the recent state, yielded, uponGENERAL PATHOLOGY. 503 pressure, a whitish, turbid fluid, containing cancer-cells with characters inter- mediate between those of medullary and of epithelial cancer. x**v. The patient was a woman between 50 and 60 years old. This disease Jl^^J^SS!! about eighteen months. Her whole body was covered with small Ped^u^'ZTsoZ growths fMolluscum simplex), and the skin of the.nates was, onboth sides to form a great cushion-like mass. The affection of the skin had existed about _'^J^8' but of late years had scarcely increased. The smaller cancerous masses, shown in the specimen, had their origin, the patient believed, in some of the molluscous growths; not so the laige mass. She recovered from the operation of removing the disease. nMnm„. Drawings Nos. 471 and 583 show the appearances, during life, of both the cancerous disease and the molluscum. 3332. Section of a Tumour and of the part of the abdominal walls in which it grew. The tumour, of nearly spherical shape, is seated m the thick layer■ ot subcutaneous fat, with the skin stretched, thinned, and superficially ulcerated over it. It is perfectly circumscribed, and is composed of a pale, soft, cancerous substance, in which are numerous smoothly-lined cysts that contained blood or blood-coloured fluid. The tumour is from two and a half to three inches m diameter; the cysts from one to four lines in diameter. xxxv. 100 The patient was 62 years old. The tumour had been about five months in progress, and its growth had commenced about four months after the removal of two tumours from the same part. These tumours had been growing for seven months, and made up a larger mass than this. Seven months after the second operation another tumour, apparently ot the same kind, began its growth in the scar. The microscopic structures of the tumour had the characters of medullary cancer. 3333. Section of a Great Toe, and of a Tumour closely surrounding, but not apparently springing from, the last phalanx. The tumour forms a large, irre- gularly oval mass, of which the greater part of the surface, exposed by ulcera- tion of the integuments, is covered by coarse wart-like granulations, and a thin layer of either greyish lymph or slough. Except at its surface, which is rather softer, the whole tumour consists of a firm, rough, elastic substance of uniform close texture, pink and white, vascular. Most parts of the tumour, also, have an obscurely fibrous appearance, as if fibres radiated from its base towards its surface. The margins of the portion of the tumour which is exposed and ulcerated are sinuous, and overhang the skin through which it protrudes ; while the skin itself is thickened, everted, and closely adapted to the margins of the protrusion. xxxv. 54 The patient was a man 43 years old. The disease commenced four years before the removal of the foot, when the toe-nail spontaneously fell off. Successive desquamations of cuticle from the bed of the nail, with ichorous discharge, occurred for a year and a half, when ulceration commenced, and the growth of the tumour soon followed. In the later periods of disease pro- fuse hemorrhages repeatedly took place from the tumour. After amputation of the foot the patient recovered. The other half of the tumour is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Presented by Eobert Ceely, Esq. 3334. Section of a large, soft, and brain-like Medullary Cancer, removed, after death, from a man's axilla. Part of it is connected with the great pectoral muscle. XXXV. 104 The patient was a man 37 years old, and this was the only tumour found in his body after death. In the nine months preceding his death, many tumours, most probably of the same nature as this, and some of them of very large size, were removed from parts of the trunk, neck, and right arm, by absorption, sloughing, or suppuration. A month before his death he was capable of active work, and the tumour here shown was very small. The history of the case is detailed in Sir Paget's " Lectures on L'athology," Third Edition, p. 692.

It is covered by a delicate trans- parent membrane resembling a serous structure—easily detached from the sub-GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 504 jacent tumour—beneath which numerous vessels ramify, retaining the appearance they presented when first examined. The tumour, though for the most part smooth upon its surface, is marked in some places by small nodular outgrowths, and in others is irregularly fissured; at the latter the investing membrane is thickened and slightly opaque. xxxv. Ill The growth was connected with a malignant affection of all the serous membranes, under which disease the patient sank slowly and died. ******* SLOUGHING- OF MALIGNANT TUMOURS. 3336. A large brain-like Medullary Tumour spotted with blood. xxxv. 60 The patient was a woman, 40 years old. The tumour, which was situated in the middle of the back, had been four months in progress. The integuments sloughed oyer it, and as she was endeavouring to raise herself in bed, the whole mass fell out through the slough. The sloughing was followed by profuse haemorrhage, and she shortly after died. 3337. A mass of firm Medullary Cancer, separated by sloughing, from a man's thigh. The femoral artery (marked by a bristle) passes through it; the femoral vein, in which a piece of glass is placed, lies in a deep groove on its inferior surface. xxxv. 107 The man was 46 years old, large, and strong. The tumour was of nine months' growth. In an attempt to remove it such haemorrhage ensued, that the operation was discontinued when about half of its surface had been uncovered. It was gradually removed by sloughing, together with the portions of the femoral artery and vein, each about three inches long, which are here shown with it. No bleeding occurred either during or after the separation of the tumour, and the cavity left by it completely healed ; but, within six months, the patient died with renewed growths of the same substance in the thigh and the lungs. The case is fully related by Mr. J. A. Kingdon, in the Medical Gazette, 1850. COLLOID CANCER. 3338. A Colloid Cancer, springing from the soft structures of the second toe. As the section through them shows, the phalanges are only surrounded by—they are not involved in—the mass. The parts were removed by Pirogoff's amputation from a sailor, 45 years old. Ten years before he had observed soft, spongy, flattened papules, about as big as split peas, one on either Bide of the end of the toe. These gave him very little inconvenience, and grew very slowly till four months before his admission to the Hospital, when the disease began to grow quickly and became painfid. In the fortnight preceding the amputation it encroached very rapidly on the soft parts of the dorsum of the foot as a soft, spongy, vascular mass, over which the skin was dusky, mottled, and streaked with distended veins. A drawing showing the specimen in the recent state is preserved, No. 588. 3339. A portion of a large mass of Colloid Cancer, which was formed in the abdomen, apparently in connexion with the omentum. The section displays the whole of the morbid substance partitioned into cells of various sizes, which are bounded and intersected by thin layers of fibrous tissue, and are filled with a transparent, pale, yellowish, semi-fluid, jelly-like substance. The external surface of the morbid mass is nodulated and invested by a tough thick membrane. xxxv. 41 3340. Another mass of Colloid Cancer from the same patient. It appears to have been produced in the abdominal walls and in the substance of a thick and long cord-like adhesion between them and the omentum. It presents the same struc- ture as the preceding. A portion of the transversal is abdominis muscle is attached to its outer surface. xxxv. 42 From a woman, between 40 and 50 years old, in whom the disease had been long in progress. The abdominal cavity was filled by three or four gallons of the gelatimform substance which had escaped from its cells ; and all the abdominal walls, the mesentery, and omentum, seemed to be involved in the disease.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. ovo 3340a. A large, sprouting, ulcerated mass of Colloid Cancer, extending around the entire circumference of the mucous membrane of the descending colon tor several inches. On the external surface of the intestine, having no peritoneal covering, there was an ulcerated aperture, half an inch in length, communicating with a large abscess cavity, which passed down into the pelvis, and tnence to the thigh. From a woman, aged 44 years.—See Post Mortem Book, vol. vii, p. 237. VASCULAR TUMOURS—ANGIOMATA. 3341. Portion of Skin, and of a subcutaneous, venous, Vascular or Erectile Tumour. The lens-shaped tumour is included between the cutis and the fascia superficialis ; it is well-defined, and part of its surface is covered with a thin scar, where a superficial ulcer over it healed. Its deeper part has the tint of partially decolorised blood. xxxv. 88 3342. The other portion of the same Vascular Tumour, dissected from the parts among which it was placed. It is minutely and rather deeply lobed; and, m this shrunken state, after the emptying of its blood-vessels, looks very like a piece of salivary gland, soft but tough, and pale brownish-white. xxxv. 89 The tumour was taken after death from a child 2 years old, in whom it had grown from the time of birth. During life it had the ordinary characters of the venous vascular tumours, being soft, compressible, dimly blue as seen through the skin, and became enlarged during forcible expiration. Six small veins could be traced to its borders; its arteries were too small to be distinct. Its whole substance appeared to be composed of minute blood-vessels, interlacing in the subcutaneous fibro-cellular and elastic tissues. The blood-vessels were generally cylindriform, but some were varicose or sacculated; all of them were of simple structure. The case is described, and some of the blood-vessels are represented, in Sir J. Paget'a " Lectures on Pathology," Third Edition, p. 578, fig. 92. 3343. Portions of a Neevus, which were removed from the inside of the cheek of a boy, 14 years old. In the upper portion a section of the nsevus is made, show- ing the consolidation which the structure had undergone from repeated attacks of inflammation. With the middle portion an inch and a quarter of the parotid duct is connected. A bristle is passed through the duct. On this portion a multitude of fine fringe-like processes have been formed by the enlargement of the papillae of the mucous membrane of the cheek. No inconvenience followed the removal of the piece of the parotid duct. xxxv. 21 3344. A small Tumour, laid open with the adjacent skin and subcutaneous tissue, which was removed from the fore-arm of a man, aged C3 years, where it had existed for two years. It was occasionally painful and exquisitely tender. When recent its section closely resembled in appearance that of the corpus cavernosum. It was sponge-like, having throughout a cellular structure, which freely com- municated with small vessels, and possessed all the characters of an ordinary vascular tumour. 3345. The Pinna of an Ear, injected, affected with arterial angioma (aneurism by anastomosis). On the upper margin and posterior surfaces the outline of the dilated and tortuous vessels is seen, beneath one of which a piece of glass is placed. Part of the external surface is rough from superficial ulceration. The section shows that the growth is composed of soft connective tissue, permeated by moderate-sized vessels. Microscopic Examination.—A section shows large tortuous vessels with thin walls, giving off capillaries of nearly uniform size, which anastomose and form a close and more or less regular network. The walls of the arterioles are formed of a layer of endothelium, supported by a thin lamina of condensed connective tissue: the capillaries of endothelial cells. The connective tissue of the growth is loose and contains numerous round cells.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 500 From a woman, aged 21 years. She had a lump on the upper part of the pinna since birth, which always pulsated. It grew very gradually until about six years ago, when it began to extend more rapidly. Ligature of a prominent portion, and later the insertion of pius beneath a part of the growth, were tried without effect. The ear stood out prominently from the head. It was of a dull red or purple colour, and of soft doughy consistence. There was distinct, Blightly distensile pulsation, arrested by pressure on the carotid artery, with a marked hum- ming bruit. The posterior auricular and temporal arteries, which supplied the growth, were much enlarged and pulsated forcibly, but the morbid change did not extend to the integuments of the head and face. The ear was removed by an incision around its attachment, the divided vessels being held by assistants. Very little blood was lost.—See account of case by Mr. Eve in the Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxxi, 1880; also Lucas Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 130. A drawing of the ear, taken before removal, is preserved, No. 590 ; Microscopic specimens, also, Nos. 177, 178, and a drawing of the microscopic appearances, A 53. 3346. The right external Ear of a man, aged 23. An erectile or vascular tumour occupies the posterior surface and involves the adjacent subcutaneous tissues, and part of the scalp. " The back of the auricle, in nearly the whole extent, was puffed out by a saperficially-lobed, soft, easily compressed, and elastic swelling, which pulsated fully and softly. Two similar and continuous lobes of swelling were under the scalp above and behind the auricle, and these were well-defined above, but gradually subsided below. The skin covering the swelling was for the most part dusky purple, but, except where it was scarred, appeared of healthy texture ; the skin of the interior of the auricle and its fibro- cartilage also appeared unaffected, except in the turgescence of the blood-vessels. A posterior branch of the superficial temporal artery passing by the front of the swelling, and a branch of the posterior auricular artery passing behind it, felt large and pulsated strongly; the common carotid artery also on this side pulsated more fully than that on the other. Its distinct soft bruit was audible, synchronous with the pulsation in the tumour, and distinct pulsatile movement was visible. The disease had been noticed like a very small pimple when the patient was four years old. It had from that time regularly increased." The case is described at greater length by Sir J. Paget in his " Lectures on Surgical Pathology," Third Edition, p. 581. " xi. 43 3347. Section of a Tumour removed from the thigh. It consists of cells or cysts, of various form and size, filled with blood, and separated by a soft me- dullary substance of a brownish-yellow colour and obscurely fibrous texture. In the upper part of the specimen are some cells distinct from the rest, which were seated in the adipose tissue of the limb. On the integuments covering the tumour there is a small tubercular elevation at one part, and at another an ulcerated opening. xxxv. 14 The patient was a woman, 45 years old. The tumour had been growing three years without pain, but with much impairment of health. Blood, sometimes as much as a pint at a time, was discharged twice or thrice a week from the ulcerated surface of the tumour. The other half of the turnour is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 3348. Section of a Tumour removed from a man's thigh. The tumour, hoof- shaped, and about seven inches in its chief diameter, projected from the outer part of the middle of the thigh, like an outgrowth of skin. The portion not covered by skin rested, as it here appears, on the fascia superficialis ; it is well defined, and very slightly lobed. Its cut surface has, in most parts, a very fine spongy aspect, and looks like a close-textured erectile tissue, on account of the great'number of sections of minute blood-vessels by which it is grooved and perforated. Large veins, some of which are indicated, lie at its base, and in the subcutaneous tissue over it. Its general texture is nearly white, but portions of it have a rusty tinge from decolourised blood. xxxv. 90 The patient was 32 years old. The tumour, commencing at the seat of a slight musket- wound received six months previously, had been ten years in progress, growing constantly and507 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. wit* severe pain.

Paget's « Lectures on Pathology/ Third Edition, p. 583. A drawing is preserved, No. 593. 3349. A Tumour which was pendulous from the skin of an axilla. It is so chained by the congestion that followed the tying of its pedicle, that its proper textures cannot now be distinguished. It had the general aspect of a peduncu- lated outgrowth of skin: but nearly its whole mass consisted of minute blood- vessels confusedly arranged and of various sizes. XXXY, 91 The patient was 60 years old. The growth had existed many years, and shortly before its removal had increased quickly. It was dark, hard, and knotty ; it pulsated distinctly, and a large artery could be felt in its pedicle. It is probable that these peculiarities depended on the morbid growth of the capillaries and minute arteries of a previously ordinary cutaneous out- growth. . . A further account is in the work last cited, Third Edition, p. 593. Presented by Dr. Ormerod. 3350. A Tumour divided by a vertical section, which was removed from the inner part of the thigh of a woman, aged 55. Its base rested on the deep fascia, and when dissected off presented a smooth, uniform surface, in which the orifices of a few large veins were visible. The greater portion of its sub- stance is sponge-like but compact, and consists of a dense vascular network. The part towards the circumference is solid, and its minute structure is ob- scurely fibrous. The tumour had existed for five years, and for the last six months had more rapidly increased in size. xxxv. 121 3351. A Tumour removed from the substance of the left semi-tendinosus muscle of a firl, aged 17 years. It is principally composed of blood-vessels. xxxv. 118 3352. Section of a Tumour removed from a woman's leg. It was lens-shaped, broadly oval, about four inches in its chief diameter, and an inch and a half in thickness, attached over the fascia of the leg by a narrow base, which all its margins overhung. It is close-textured, but soft and brittle, of ochre-yellow colour, and on its cut surface presenting very numerous minute apertures, like the orifices of divided and collapsed small veins. The skin covering it is thinned and tense. At its upper part is a large clot of blood, extravasated the day before the tumour was removed. xxxv. 63 The patient was a healthy-looking woman, 51 years old. Twenty years before the removal of this tumour, and from the same part of the leg, a " wen" was removed which had been growing for six months. She remained well for ten years, then this tumour began to grow at the scar of the previous operation. It increased slowly for nine years, and very quickly for the last year, during which also bleeding several times occurred from a superficially ulcerated part of the skin. It was noticed that, by pressure, the tumour could be much reduced in size, as if by pressing blood from it; and that, on removing the pressure, it quickly regained its size, as if by the refilling of very numerous blood-vessels. Under the microscope its tissues were found obscured, and indistinguishable through extreme fatty degeneration. It may be regarded as a degenerate venous erectile, or vascular tumour. ******* TUMOURS OF UNCERTAIN NATURE. 3353. A Bony Tumour, or outgrowth from the junction of the petrous portionGENERAL PATHOLOGY. 508 of the temporal bone with the body of the sphenoid and the occipital bones on the left side of the base of the skull of a woman, aged 35 years. The structure of the outgrowth appears to be of a firm material like dry cheese, infiltrated throughout with granules of earthy matter. The outer layers im- mediately beneath the dura mater are formed of firm dense bone. Microscopic examination showed an abundance of fat, with debris of cells mixed with earthy particles. The tumour projected into the posterior fossa of the base of the skull, and was not discovered until the complete removal of the brain. The latter appeared perfectly healthy. The patient was admitted into the Ophthalmic Ward on account of suppuration in the orbit and frontal sinus following a blow upon the eje and nose. Meningitis resulted and caused her death, the inflammation evidently spreading from the frontal sinus throughout the entire right side of the meninges. The membranes on the left side of the brain, and at the base in the situation of the tumour were perfectly normal.—See Ophthalmic Ward Boole, vol. i, p. 147. 3354. A Tumour, which was removed from the substance of the triceps muscle of the left arm of a woman, aged 32 years. It was situated two or three inches above and behind the elbow-joint. It was tender when handled, and the pain extended down the fore-arm to the two last fingers. In the operation the ulnar nerve was found passing tightly over its surface. The woman had been aware of its existence for five or six months. The tumour has a fibrous structure, but the distinction between it and the investing portion of the triceps is by no means well-defined. The ruddy fibres of the muscle seemed to pass abruptly into the pale, dense, and more uniform substance of the tumour. 3355. The outer portion of the hand of a boy, aged 14 years. Some days before the limb was removed, the palm of the hand became painful and swollen, apparently without any previous injury. It was punctured and some dark fluid blood escaped. From that time it rapidly increased, a large mass pro- truding through the aperture. The whole of the palmar surface is occupied by a large mass through which the flexor tendons pass unchanged. When recent, it presented the aspect of blood clot in a state of decomposition. The microscopic characters were those of fibrin and blood clot. 3356. Section of a part of the integuments and muscles of an upper Arm. The subcutaneous tissue, and the cellular tissue connected with it and extendinsr between the muscles down to the bone, are indurated, opaque-white, and fibrous like the tissue of a cicatrix. Small portions only of the subcutaneous fat remain. Imbedded in this indurated substance, and in a few instances in the adjacent muscles also, are numerous small, nodulated, soft tumours. They now present a pinkish colour; but, in the recent state they were greyish, glistening, nearly transparent, and jelly-like. Many of the tumours are closely grouped; and the skin over some of them is raised in a coarsely tuberculated form, and is excoriated or covered by a thin cuticle. xxxv. 58 3357. A section of the integuments which covered the elbow of the same arm, exhibiting a large oval mass, apparently composed of the same substance as the tumours just described, but firmer and more uniform. Its exposed surface is formed of healthy-looking granulations. Its base rests on the aponeurosis of the triceps humeri muscle. xxxv. 59 The patient wa9 a woman, 32 years old. The disease had existed eight years. It com- menced with a deep-seated induration in the arm, whence it extended by the formation of fresh tumours both upwards and downwards, till the surface of nearly the whole upper arm was tuberculated. The patient recovered after amputation at the shoulder-joint.509 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. CYSTIC OR ENCYSTED TUMOURS—CYSTOMATA. I. CYSTS WHICH PROCEED FROM TRANSFORMATION OF NORMAL HOLLOW SPACES. a. Cysts through enlargement of normal serous sacs. 3358. A Bursa removed from over the olecranon. It contains two distinct cavities, separated by a thin septum, but the walls of the cavities are con- tinuous, as if the bursal cyst had originally been single. They contained a brown serous fluid. The patient was a drayman ; lie could give no explanation of the origin of the bursa. 3359. A Cyst removed from the palm of the hand. It contained a serous fluid, and extended over the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, to the periosteum of which it was at one part closely adherent. Its walls are composed of a tough fibrous tissue ; its exterior is smooth; its interior has a slightly polished surface, rendered irregular by prominent intersecting fibrous bands. xxxv. 34 b. Cysts through distension of closed Follicles. 3360. A Cyst, attached by a thick pedicle to the surface of an ovary. 3361. A Section of an Ovary, having its surface covered by many small pro- jecting cysts. Some minute cysts are also imbedded in its substance, which is dense and fibrous. Two corpora lutea are cut across near the surface, the larger of which is dilated into a small cyst. Removed from a patient whose opposite ovary was affected with cystic disease, for which ovariotomy was performed. c. Cysts by Transformation of Mucous Membrane Canals from Distension. 3362. A Uterus and its appendages. The right Fallopian tube is greatly dilated, forming a large cyst, globular at its extremity, but having the form of a tortuous tube at its attachment to the uterus; it contained a serous fluid. The interior of the cyst -presents some septa, formed apparently by folding and unequal dilatation of the tube. Several bands of adhesion are attached to the cyst, the uterus, and broad ligaments. The ovary is seen below the cyst, and between it and the uterus. The wall of the uterus is thickened and a fleshy growth projects into its interior. From a lady, aged 53 years (married 28 years). During the last twenty years she had had five miscarriages. Menopause at 52 years. In October, 187U, she began to suffer pain in the right groin, intense every night for from six to twelve hours. In January, a tumour was felt, behind and to the right of the uterus. She died in May, 1880, apparently from exhaustion, and no disease of any other organ was found on post mortem examination. Presented by Dr. Matthews Duncan. d. Cysts formed by Closure or Obstruction of, and accumulation of the Secretion within, the Ducts of Glands and their prolongations : so-called Retention Cysts. 3363. A cutaneous Cyst removed with the skin covering it from some part of the border of the hairy scalp. It is regular, nearly spherical, smooth, and thin- walled. The greater part of its internal surface is lined with compact, but easily broken material, consisting, probably, of epidermal scales and fatty matter. xxxv. 105 Presented by Dr. James Reid.510 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 3364. Cutaneous Cysts, which were removed from the scalp. Their walls are thick ami firm, and they contain a thick, pale, grumous substance. xxxv. 7 3364a. Urinary Organs of a Fcetus. The bladder is greatly dilated and hyper- trophied; the ureters equally so, especially near their terminations iu the bladder. The kidneys are converted into agglomerations of numerous cysts, lined by thick corrugated membrane, many of which appear to be formed by dilatation of the calyces and infundibula. The cysts were filled with transparent fluid. There is no trace of proper renal parenchyma. a. 116 3365. Portion of a Fibro-Adenoma of the mammary gland, in which a smooth- walled cyst is imbedded. e. Cysts arising from Blood and Lymphatic Vessels. 3366. A small oval Cyst, with a wrinkled, but polished lining membrane, and exhibiting two valves, like those of a vein, attached to its wall. On one of these valves is a small soft lobulated growth. The walls of the cyst are thin, and loosely attached to the skin and other adjacent parts. aitendix. 10 The eyst was full of blood, and was removed from the thigh of an elderly woman, in whom it occupied the position of the upper part of the internal saphenous vein. It appears to have been formed by a portion of the vein remaining open between two points in which its canal had been obliterated. No portion of a blood-vessel could be traced opening into the cyst. /. Cysts connected with the remains of Foetal Organs; or from the inclusion or displacement of Foetal Structures; and some Congenital Cysts. 3367. The extremity of a Fallopian Tube, with the ovary. A small cyst is attached by a slender thread or pedicle, about two inches long, to the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube; there is another similar, but much smaller thread. These are the hydatids of Morgagni, believed to be the remains of the upper extremities of Muller's ducts. 3368. A quantity of long pale hair, with portions of fatty matter, from a cyst. The fatty matter is in little globules arranged like beads upon the hairs. xxxv. 56 The cyst was removed from beneath the skin of the chest of a middle-aged man. The rest of its contents consisted of a pale creamy fluid. 3368a. Portions of a Tumour, from the anterior mediastinum. They consist of irregularly lobed portions of skin and fat, a bone resembling a superior maxil- lary bone, and another portion of bone like an alveolar border, with sockets, in which are imbedded two incisor, two bicuspid, and three molar teeth. VOL. II. A. 177 The patient was a woman, 21 years old. The tumour was probably congenital. Fourteen months before her death, while she was suffering apparently with pneumonia, a part of the tumour projected below the sternal extremity of the left clavicle, and pulsated regularly and strongly, it was treated as an aneurism, with repeated bleedings, &c, and after enlarging for some time, and threatening suffocation by pressure on the trachea, it began to subside, and at length wholly disappeared from sight and touch. A month after this, the patient died with renewed pneumonia. The tumour was closely attached to the upper two-thirds of the sternum, and to the sternal extremity of the right clavicle. The arteria innominata was completely enveloped by the thickened cellular tissvie which connected the tumour with the surrounding parts ; and it is probable that hence was derived the pulsation which was felt while the tumour was inflamed and swollen. Besides the substances shown in the preparation the tumour contained serous fluid, and sebaceous matter, mixed with hair. The bones were enclosed in a fatty ma=s. The case is related by Dr. Gordon, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xiii, p. 12, 1825. Presented by "William Kingdon, Esq.GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 511 3369. A Cyst removed from a dark-red Cow.

An Ovary, in which is a single cyst containing a mass of fatty matter, with stiff, pale hairs imbedded in it. xxxi. 3 3371. A Cyst (? dermoid) with thin tough walls, which was removed from beneath the tongue. It projected into the mouth, and extended so far down- wards as to be prominent in the front of the neck. Its contents are a firm grumous and granulated suet-like substance. XXXV. 25 3372. The Pelvis of a female infant, with a Cyst attached to it. The cyst is about six inches in diameter, and is formed of dense membrane, covered with integument. It is firmly attached to the inferior border of the walls of the pelvis, and a small portion or lobe of it extends into the pelvis between the rectum and the sacrum. At the upper part, small cysts in its walls project into the cavity of the main cyst. These smaller cysts contained a serous fluid; the larger cavity contained serous fluid and blood, and is lined with a fine trans- parent membrane. The sacrum and coccyx are perfect, but firmly attached to the posterior and upper part of the cyst. No communication existed between the cyst and the canal for the spinal cord formed by the dura mater; but, external to the dura mater, there were communications between the cyst and the spinal canal" of the sacrum and coccyx, through some of the foramina for the anterior sacral nerves. Certain of these nerves also were traced to the interior of the cyst. The child was born alive at the full period. In its passage through the inferior aperture of the pelvis, the tumour burst, and discharged a large quantity of sanguineous fluid. After birth the child cried and moved freely: but it lived only two hours, dying, apparently, in con- sequence of the haemorrhage from the cyst. Presented by Thomas Wormald, Esq. 3373. Portion of a Spine, with the Pelvis, and a Congenital Tumour, from a child 2 years old. The tumour measures fourteen and a-half inches in circum- ference : it projects from the lower part and right side of the pelvis ; and is composed of several oval and spheroidal lobes. One portion is solid, and resembles a fibrous tumour of the uterus. Another, much larger, consists of two cysts, one enclosed within the other, and both having dense, fibrous, laminated walls, a quarter of an inch thick. They contained a clear yellow fluid. The upper and narrow portion of the tumour is solid, and extends into the cavity of the pelvis through its inferior aperture. It reaches nearly to the top of the sacrum, and encompasses the bladder and rectum. The sacrum and other parts of the spine are perfect: no communication exists between the tumour and the canal for the spinal cord ; and its connections with the sacrum and the pelvic organs are by loose cellular tissue. vol. ii. a. 129 The child was in other respects healthy and well formed. The tumour at birth was nearly as large as an orange, and increased in proportion to the child's growth. Death occurred during measles. This and the preceding specimen are described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-CMrurgical Transactions, vol. xxiv, p. 231, 1841. Presented by J. F. Harding, Esq. 3374. A Congenital Cystic Sacral Tumour, springing from the buttock posterior to the sacrum and coccyx—which are well developed—not extending into the pelvis, and having apparently no communication with the spinal canal. The right section shows some large cysts, which contained a brownish fluid: from512 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. the lower a membranous cyst hangs. The left section shows several cysts filled with a soft brain-like very vascular substance. The rectum is exposed by the division of the sacrum. vol. ii. a. 187 From an infant, born at full term. 3375. Part of a larsre Tumour removed from a woman's nates. The tumour O consisted chiefly of a collection of cysts, with tough fibrous walls, lined by smooth membrane, and variously filled. Some contained serous fluid; some a thicker, creamy, or fatty matter; in some were small bundles of hair, loose, or inserted in their walls. Other parts of the tumour consisted of solid substance, in which irregular masses of bone were imbedded. vol. n. a. 180 The patient was a woman about 50 years old. The tumour was congenital, and bad grown to the size of the patient's head. It was pendulous from the nates, and parts of it had sup- purated. Its deeper attachments were closely connected with the coccyx, rectum, and vagina. The patient recovered perfectly after its removal; a small sinus remained at one portion of the wound, but no recurrence of the growth ensued. 3376. The portions of Bone obtained by maceration from the tumour last described. They are of irregular nodulated forms, and not comparable with any of the natural bones of the skeleton. VOL. u. A. 181 II. CYSTS FROM EXTRAVASATIONS OF BLOOD. 3377. Portion of Dura Mater, upon the surface of which there is an adventitious membrane, in the form of a sac which was filled by coagulated blood. The membrane is of a dense texture, and of about the thickness of the dura mater. Portions of the blood still remain attached to the inner walls of the sac. vi. 52 3378. A specimen, showing Cystic Degeneration of a Corpus Imtenm. The ovary was found with a large mass of omentum in an inguinal hernia on the left side of a woman, aged 35 years : it is larger than natural. Two corpora lutea are seen in its substance ; one, near the surface, presents a normal appear- ance ; the other, near the centre, appears as a large cavity, an inch in diameter, filled with partially decolorised grumous blood, which escaped when the ovary was incised. The opposite ovary is preserved in Sub-Series A, No. 207. III. CYST OF PRIMARY ORIGIN.. 3379. A Cyst in a Pectoral Muscle connected with tumours, character unknown, of the breast and liver.

The cyst may have originated in one of the lymphatic vessels of the diaphragm. A drawing is preserved, No. 595. 3381. A Cyst, removed from beneath the skin covering the lower part of the scapula. It was filled with a fluid resembling venous blood. Its walls are soft, and its interior is polished, but rendered irregular by numerous decussating prominent ridges, which give it a striking resemblance to the interior of an auricle. Its walls are from half a line to two lines in thickness : at the parts where they are thickest, they contain numerous small cysts filled with a dark coloured fluid. xxxv. 38 The patient was a lad, 15 years old.

Calculi from a Urinary Bladder. The two larger, chiefly composed of rather loosely aggregated Uric Acid, were removed by the operation of lithotomy. The first was crushed in the extraction. The second, extracted entire, is in the shape of a three-sided pyramid, the base and sides of which are all smoothly flattened. The fragments of the first indicate that it may have had nearly the same shape. At the operation it was thought unlikely that such a shape would be acquired, unless more than two calculi were present, and subject to mutual contact and friction. Long search was, therefore, made for others ; but none existed, except two minute rough portions, which could have had no share in shaping the larger calculi that were extracted. The patient was 51 years old. He had suffered, at times severely, for eight years before the operation, and died on the fourth day after it. 23. Three smooth and flattened Calculi.

Calculi broken into several portions, which were fonnd after death in the bladder of an old man. They had broken spontaneously, and appear to have been parts of several large calculi; the edges of many of the fragments are rounded by mutual friction. They consist of Uric Acid, with a few layers of Urate of Ammonia. The patient was 81 years old, and had suffered for more than a year with signs of stone in the bladder. He would not allow an instrument to be passed, but on two occasions in the nine months previous to his death, he obtained great relief from the use of alkaline medicines. Presented by J. F.

The larger calculus was situated in the right ureter near the bladder: the smaller portions were situated in the pelvis and infundibula of the right kidney. The larger calculus is composed of Urate of Ammonia with a trace of Uric Acid. Lithotomy had been performed a fortnight before death. The kidneys were both very much dilated, and their pelves and calyces were filled with pus. 208. Calculus composed of Urates coated with Phosphates and fragments, removed during life from the kidney of a woman, aged 44 years. See St. Bartholomew''s Hospital Reports, vol. ix, 1873. 209. An Oxalate of Lime Calculus removed by the operation of Nephrolithotomy. It presents the extremely rough and spiculated surface characteristic of such calculi. The patient was a young man, aged 20. At tbe age of 5 years he had suffered from hsematuria, but not since. For the past ten years there bad been intermittent pain in the right lorn and testis, which for eighteen months had been very severe. While in the Hospital he had paroxysms of intense pain in the right testis, shooting downward from the region of the kidney, and followed by the discharge of a large quantity of urine containing oxalic acid. The calculus was felt close to the pelvis, and was easily removed after scratching through a thin layer of the kidney which covered it. The operation was performed by Mr. Butlin— See Pitcairn Ward Book, vol. vii, p. 170. 210. A Renal Calculus taken from the body of a middle-aged lady, who died of scarlatina, and who, as a child, had frequently complained of pain in the back, and tenderness in the renal region; latterly these symptoms had been absent. The calculus consists of pure Oxalate of Lime of the crystalline and dumb-bell varieties. 211. Small Calculus passed from the kidney. Oxalate of Lime with crystals. 212. Renal Calculi from a man 38 years of age. In the right kidney were :— 1. A great calculus, weighing 36£ ounces. 2. About a thousand smaller calculi, nine of these larger than a cherry-stone, and weighing from 19 to 70 grains each; the rest of the calculi, larger than a millet seed, weighed together nearly 2 ounces. 3. A large quantity of calculous dust. In the left kidney were—1. A calculus weighing 9| ounces. 2. A quantity of calculous dust. The stones and gravel consisted chiefly of the Phosphate of Magnesia and Ammonia; in the largest stone there was a nucleus composed of Oxalate of Lime, with traces of Phosphate of Magnesia and Ammonia, Carbonate of Lime, and Uric Acid.

Extracted by Mr. Stanley from a cyst communicating with the urethra near the bladder of a boy 6 years old. 221. Part of 146 Calculi, removed from a sac connected with the middle of the spongy portion of the urethra. It was not certain whether the sac was formed by the urethra dilated behind the stricture which existed immediately in front of it; or was formed, after ulceration of the urethra, in the tissues around it. They are composed of Fusible Calculus with thin layers of Urate of Ammonia intermixed. Operation by Mr. Vincent. The patient was a man, 23 years old. He had been for ten years subject to incontinence of urine, the consequence of a kick, by wbich the urethra was ruptured or otherwise injured. He was in the habit of wearing a yoke to compress the anterior part of the urethra. Six years before the removal of the calculi he had bleeding from the urethra for several days, and then first perceived the swelling in the perineum, which from that time gradually increased with the increase of the calculi. The rest of the calculi are in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 222. A large Oval Calculus. Phosphate of Lime with Phosphate of Ammonia and Magnesia. Extracted by Mr. Stanley from a cyst which communicated with a fistulous passage leading from the bladder to the perineum. 223.

Its blood-vessels are minutely injected; they form an irregular wide- meshed plexus. Prepared and presented by Henry Gray, Esq. 156. A small partially healed Scar on the Face, caused by the bite of a mad dog, and leading to the death of the patient from hydrophobia. The wound shows the ordinary appearances of healing by granulations. The epithelium termi- nates abruptly on either side of the wound, the surface of which is covered by a thick layer of closely-crowded " indifferent" cells. These also infiltrate the subjacent subcutaneous tissue to a considerable depth. 157. A section taken at the margin of an Ulcer of the Leg. It shows essentially the same appearances as the preceding ; at the margin of the ulcer the epithe- lium is thickened and its interpapillary processes are elongated. ENCHONDEOMATA. 158. Sections of an Enchondroma, which grew from the posterior surface of a Femur into the popliteal space. The cartilage cells are of very varying shapes, and some are branched: the matrix is in places softened and breaking down from mucoid degeneration. 159.

From Specimen No. 3296. 164. Section of a Tumour of the Palate, of many years' duration. It consists of round cells, lying on the surface of, or in the spaces between, bands of fibrous tissue, having somewhat the arrangement and appearance of trabecular of can- cellous bone. 165. Section of a rapidly growing Sarcoma of the Lip of a young child. It consists of round elongated and spindle-shaped cells, closely aggregated, or in places separated by a considerable amount of fine filamentous or mucous con- nective tissue. 166. A soft Sarcoma (? lympho-sarcoma) removed from the popliteal space. Under the microscope it shows small, closely-crowded, round cells, lying within alveoli formed by trabecules of homogeneous connective tissue. The cells have the size and appearance of white blood or lymph corpuscles. 167. Section of a recurrent growth from the same case preserved in Specimen No. 3298, and having the same histological characters. 168. Section of a subcutaneous Tumour, composed for the most part of small spindle-cells, intermixed abundantly in places with round-cells. Round-cells are abundant around the vessels, which have no proper walls. In places a transition from round-cells into spindle-cells is observable, and again a trans- formation of spindle-cells into connective tissue. From Specimen No. 3303. ADENOMA. 169. Section of an Adenoma of the Skin. In histological structure it consists of convoluted and branching columns of very small cells. Some of the larger columns contain a central space, filled with granular material, and having the appearance of the lumen of a tubular gland. The granular matter consists of fat, and contains crystals of cholesterine. The tumour may be regarded as an adenoma connected with the sebaceous glands.

A Warty Growth, removed from the hack of the hand of an old lady. The cuticle is only slightly thickened, but there is a very decided growth of the inter- papillary processes of the rete Malpighii in the form of columns, the centres of which contain rounded masses of cornified epithelium (cell-nests), in some cases seen to be continuous with the cornified epithelium on the surface of the wart. 173. Section of a Warty Growth from the Perineum. The microscope shows in addition to an increased thickness of the cuticle, an ingrowth from the deep stratum of the rete Malpighii in the form of down-dipping papillary processes, containing in places " cell-nests." It appears to be a wart in a state of transi- tion to epithelioma ; a condition seen also in the preceding specimen. The case is described by Mr. Eve, in a paper " On the Relation between Irritation and Epithelioma."—British Medical Journal, April 2nd, 1881. From Specimen No. 3324. 174. Section through part of an Epithelioma of the Heel. At the' margin of the growth papillary prolongations of the rete Malpighii extend downwards into the corium; and towards its centre this ingrowth is much more considerable ; the cuticle (stained with picro-carmine) is here much thickened, and is con- tinued downwards into the growth as large, irregularly branched columns of cornified epithelium, surrounded by a layer of small epithelial cells, resembling those of the rete Malpighii. 175. Section of another portion of the same growth taken from the extreme margin. The epithelioma grew from a corn, which had existed some years. The case is described in the same paper with the preceding, No. 174. From Specimen No. 3325. 176. A section of an Epithelioma of the Tongue taken parallel to the surface.

ANGIOMA. 177. Section through various parts of the Pinna of an Ear affected with arterial angioma, the vessels of which are injected. A dense network of minute anas- tomosing capillaries extends throughout most of the sections, and large sinus- like vessels and smaller arterioles are also cut across. The walls of the latter are composed of layers of condensed connective tissue; and the capillary walls of a single layer of endothelium. The vessels are imbedded in a matrix of filamentous connective tissue, containing many round and some spindle-shaped nuclei. 178. Section of the skin of the Pinna from the same specimen. The network of capillaries extends into the corium; and the interpapillary processes of the rete Malpighii are elongated, and in some places a very distinct branched ingrowth of epithelium is observed.

Cast of a Head, in which the bones are extremely thickened, with changes of structure similar to that shown in Series I, No. 72. 2. Cast of a Leg, showing great thickening of the Tibia, and a well-marked curvature of the bone with the convexity forwards. The other leg was similarly affected. From a girl, aged 16 years, whose legs did not become affected until she was 9 years old. At the time the cast was taken there was no pain or tenderness of the tibia and the deformity was not increasing. There was no evidence of congenital syphilis ; none of the other bones were affected, nor were the ribs beaded. 2a. Cast of a Leg, the Tibia of which is thickened and curved with the convexity in the anterior direction. There was no evidence of congenital syphilis. 3. Cast of a Foot and Ankle, showing a peculiar deformity, due to the abnormal prominence of the malleoli. On a level with the epiphysial line at the lower extremity of the fibula, is a smooth nodular outgrowth of bone. The whole of the internal malleolus is greatly and uniformily enlarged, and there is also a slight separate outgrowth at the level of the epiphysial line. From a boy, aged 9 years. 4. Cast of a boy's Head with a large tumour, described in Series I, No. 455. 4a. Cast of a Head, with a large cartilaginous and osseous tumour, involving and extending far over the right superior maxillary bone.

Cast of the Head of a child, with a tumour of the face, produced by a morbid growth, originating in the superior maxillary bone. The growth had existed from birth. 10. Cast of a Face, deformed by a disease originating in the antrum. 11. Model of a Leg, with epithelial cancer, which, originating probably in the skin, had involved the periosteum over the front of the tibia. The diseased parts are preserved in Series I, Nos. 493, 494. 12. Model of a Leg, showing the further progress of a similar disease. The cancerous growth has its base in the cancellous tissue and posterior wall of the tibia, the superjacent parts having been destroyed by it. The diseased parts are in Series I, Nos. 491, 493. 13. Cast of a Lower Extremity. The femur was surrounded by the large tumour, of which parts are preserved in Series I, Nos. 515, 516. DISEASES OF JOINTS. 14. Cast of a Knee-Joint, swollen by the accumulation of fluid within its cavity. The surface of the swelling is unequal, because of the unequal resistance of the parts around the joint ; and it appears divided by depressions extending out- wards from the sides of the patella, and downwards from its lower margin to the tibia. The outline of the patella, raised by the fluid in the joint, can be traced. 15. Cast of a Knee-Joint, greatly enlarged by chronic disease, probably affecting chiefly the synovial membrane and the ligaments. The patient had the power of dislocating his leg in any direction at will. 16. Cast of a Knee-Joint affected with destructive disease. On either side of the joint is a bulging prominence produced by a circumscribed dilatation of the synovial membrane. 16a. Cast of part of the Lower Extremity of a man. At the upper part of the calf is a large rounded swelling, found after amputation to be due to a cyst lying between the integuments and the gastrocnemius muscle, and communi- cating with the knee-joint. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint was dis- tended, and the joint was the seat of destructive inflammation. 17. Cast of the Bones of a Hip-Joint, from a gentleman who, several years before death, received a severe injury of the hip in a fall, and remained lame ; much doubt existed, during life, respecting the nature of the injury sustained. The condition of the bones shown by the casts is such as would result from loner, continued inflammation, producing deposit of bone upon the head of the femur and the borders of the acetabulum. 18. Cast of the Bones of a Hip, with dislocation of the femur in consequence of disease of the joint. The head of the femur rests on the surface of the ilium directly above the acetabulum. ' 19. Cast of the Knee-Joint of an adult. During disease in childhood the bones 2 o 2564 CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED^OR~ INJURED PARTS. of the leg were dislocated, moving directly backwards from their connexion with the femur. The tissues about the joint were atrophied and contracted. 20. A Knee contracted from disease. 20a. Cast of a Knee affected with rheumatoid-arthritis. The synovial membrane is distended, and on either side of the joint is a rounded prominence, running from before backwards, and due to the growth of osteophytes from the margins of the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia. 21, 22. Casts of a man's Hands, deformed with masses of gouty deposit (chalk- stones) about nearly all the articulations of the fingers. All the fingers also are directed towards the ulnar margin of the hand. Presented by Owen Evans, Esq. 23. A specimen of the same disease in a slighter degree. Presented by Dr. Dyce Duckworth. 23a. Casts of two Hands with many nodes over the phalangeal and metacarpo- phalangeal joints, produced by deposits of urate of soda. INJURIES OF BONES (Fractures). 24. Cast of the upper half of a Humerus, in which a transverse fracture through the surgical neck separated the head with the tubercles from the shaft. Union took place, with the lower border of the head impacted in the cancellous tissue of the upper part of the shaft, and with such misplacement that, if the articular surface of the head had its natural relation to the glenoid cavity, the shaft must have been abducted to an angle of thirty to forty degrees from the side of the body. From a specimen in the Museum of St. Mary's Hospital. 25 Cast of a Fore-arm and Hand, with deformity of the Wrist, connected with fracture of the radius an inch from the joint, and separation of the triangular fibro-cartilage from its radial attachment. The parts are in Series III, Nos. 926. 26. Cast of a Hand and part of the Fore-arm, taken immediately after the occur- rence of a fracture through the lower extremity of a radius (Colles' fracture). 27. Cast of a Knee fourteen years after fracture of the patella. The portions of the patella are four inches apart, and, in the bent position of the joint, the con- dyles of the femur project between them. The strength and movements of the joint were not seriously impaired. 28. Fracture of the Patella, with great separation of the two portions, taken many years after the accident. 29. Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula immediately above the ankle-joint. Presented by Or. Smith, Esq. 30. Cast of a Leg, with great deformity at, and above, the ankle-joint, in conse- quence of a comminuted fracture of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula, and the accumulation of bone in the repair of the injury. 31. Cast of a Foot, which had been dislocated outwards, with, probably, fracture of the internal malleolus and fibula. After the usual treatment, the form and strength of the limb appeared to be restored. But the patient returned too early565 CASTS AND MODELS OP DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. to his work as a lamp-lighter, and very gradually his foot was again displaced; yet without great damage to his power of progression. 32. A partial Dislocation of the Foot outwards from the tibia, with fracture of the lower extremity of the fibula. 33. A Cast, showing a somewhat similar condition. 34. Displacement of the Foot outwards and somewhat backwards, with fracture of the Fibula. 35. Cast of a Leg, with dislocation of the Foot straight backwards from the aukle-joint, and fracture of the fibula a short distance above its malleolus. INJURIES OF JOINTS (Dislocations, Ac). 36. A Cast showing a recent Dislocation of the acromial end of the clavicle, upwards and backwards. Presented by L. Holden, Esq. 37. Cast of a Shoulder, with an old dislocation of the humerus, the head of the bone lying immediately below the coracoid process of the scapula. The parts are preserved in Series IV, No. 1020. 38. Cast of a Shoulder, with the head of the humerus dislocated into the axilla. 39. Cast of a Shoulder, with the head of the humerus dislocated upon the dorsum of the scapula. The head of the humerus rested against the inferior surface and outer edge of the spine of the scapula, its anterior edge being worn in adaptation to the posterior margin of the lower half of the glenoid cavity. Dislocation occurred long before death. The humerus was also fractured in the middle of its shaft. The bones are preserved in Series IV, No. 1027. 40. Cast of a Shoulder, with the head of the humerus recently dislocated upon the infra-spinous fossa of the scapula. 41. Cast of an Elbow, with the radius and ulna dislocated on the posterior surface of the lower end of the humerus. 42. Cast of an adult Elbow, with a prominence at the outer part of the joint, due to a dislocation of the head of the radius, which occurred in early life. The head of the radius appears to have been in relation with the outer surface of the external condyle of the humerus; but the motions of the joint were perfect. 43. Cast of the Fore-arm and Hand of a woman in whom the hand was dis- located from the radius and ulna in early childhood. The ulna projected far backwards, and the little finger diverging from the rest, was directed backwards and inwards. Its was not known whether the dislocations were produced by violence or in consequence of disease. 44. Cast of a Dislocation of the Carpus backwards, from the radius and ulna. From a man, who fell a height of forty feet, sustaining at the same time several other injuries, from which he recovered. 45. Cast of a left Hand and Fore-arm. The hand and carpus together are con- siderably displaced forwards and to the radial side, so that the outline of the articular surface of the ulna, and almost the whole of that of the radius, can be traced. Flexion was scarcely at all impaired ; extension much more so. TheCASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 566 patient could grasp with considerable force, and was still gaining strength in the joint. From a sailor, aged 35 years, who had always had excellent health. Two years before applying at the Hospital his wrist became swollen and painful; but he continued at his work till six months Lit er, when he fell, doubling the wrist beneath him. The accident was followed by great pain in the part with much swelling and redness of the integuments. Suppuration soon ensued, and was succeeded by gradual displacement of the carpus and hand forwards and outwards. The sinuses which formed discharged freely for some months, and then closed. When last seen, he was again working as a sailor. There were several sinus-scars about the joint. 46. Cast of the Bones of a Hip-Joint. The head of the femur, long before death, was dislocated into the obturator foramen, and now projects, with a consider- able prominence, into the cavity of the pelvis. 46a. Spontaneous Dislocation of both Femora from disease. The cast was taken from a child, aged 4 years ; the thighs were usually flexed on the abdomen, and the legs on the thighs, but there was free movement at the hip-joints short of extreme flexion and extension. The pelvis was widened and the nates flattened. On making an examination under chloroform, the femora were found to be dislocated upwards and back- wards. On making extension the heads of the femora returned to their sockets, but regained their former abnormal position on relaxing the extension. The child began to walk at the usual time, and nothing abnormal was observed about the hip-joints. Four months before his admission to the Hospital symptoms of inflammation appeared in the left hip, a few days after he had been placed astride a horse for a few minutes, and 2\ months later the right hip became similarly affected. The case is related by Mr. W. Morrant Baker in the St. Bartholomew''s Hospital Reports, vol. x, p. 287. 47. Cast of a case of Congenital Dislocation of both Femora, taken from a man, aged 24 years. The cast was taken with the patient in the recumbent posture. 48. Cast of a right Knee, with the patella dislocated outwards, its inner margin being directed straight forwards. The cast was made very shortly after the injury. Presented by T. Blizard Curling, Esq. 49. Cast of a right Knee, with the patella dislocated on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur. The dislocation had long existed. The parts are in Series IV, No. 1051. 50. Cast of a Knee, in which it was presumed that displacement of the internal semilunar cartilage had been produced by external violence. Over the situation of the cartilage there is a deep crescentic depression of the integuments. The patient was knocked down, and fell with his left leg bent under him ; and from that instant was unable to bear weight on the limb. In examining the limb, whilst the knee was bent to its utmost, a sudden crack was heard, the depression of the integuments on the inner side of the joint disappeared, and the mobility of the joint was restored. 51. Cast of the inner surface of the left Knee-Joint of a man, aged 48 years. The Tibia and Fibula were dislocated outwards with the Patella, which was partially rotated inwards. The prominence on the inside is the internal condyle of the Femur. The prominence in front is the Patella, with the outer edge turned forward. 52. Cast of a right Knee, with dislocation of the tibia and fibula inwards. Presented by Martin Coates, Esq. 53. Cast of a right Knee. The tibia is not only dislocated backwards and out- wards, but is drawn upwards to such an extent that the outer condyle of theCASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 567 femur rests on the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, just below the inner tuberosity. From a man, aged 63 years, who had been subject to rheumatic attacks the last 0f_ which occurred eleven months before his admission into the Hospital . The P°^* "^dJ^™ knee remained swollen for six weeks after this attack, and that while the swelling was subsid ng, he suddenly felt, early one morning, the joint give way and the bones at once fell into much the same position shown in the cast. He recovered after amputation through the knee- joint. 54. A Cast of a left Foot and Leg, exhibiting a dislocation of the foot backwards. From a man, aged 58, who, four years before admission into the Hospital dislocated his foot backwards, by slipping forward as he came down stairs. He was aid up for about a month after the accident, but, at the end of this time, began to get about although the dislocation was not reduced. At the time of Ms admission the patient could walk pretty well, and without pain or special difficulty. There was a fair amount of motion, both in flexion and extension ot the foot. See Rahere Ward Book, vol. ii, p. 371 55. Cast of an Ankle-Joint, with a similar dislocation. 56. Cast of a Foot, showing a sub-astragaloid dislocation of the foot inwards; the head of the astragalus forms a prominence on the outer side of the foot. 57. Cast of a deformity of the Foot, produced by an injury. Probably a sub- astragaloid dislocation of the foot outwards. 58. Cast of an injury to a Foot of uncertain nature. There are two prominences on the outer side, the upper of which is probably the head of the astragalus, the lower, the anterior, and outer edge of the os calcis. The anterior bones of the tarsus appear to be somewhat displaced inwards. The lower part of the fibula was fractured. Presented by Gh Smith, Esq. DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. 59.

Similar Casts of a case of Talipes Equino-Varus, before and after treat- ment, including- subcutaneous division of the tendo Achillis, the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle, and of the plantar fascia. The patient was a girl, 12 years old. After the restoration of the shape of the foot the whole liinb became larger. 83. Cast of a left Leg and Foot affected with an extreme degree of Talipes Equino-Varus, from a boy aged 11 years. Owing to the extreme rigidity of the foot all attempts to remedy the deformity by instruments were useless. 84. A Cast of the right Leg and Foot of the same patient similarly deformed, but in a slighter degree. 85. A Cast of the left Foot of the same patient, from whom the two preceding casts were taken, after the performance of the following operation. A wedge- shaped mass, with the base outwards, was removed from the tarsus, including the anterior portion of the cuboid, the bases of the outer three or four meta-tarsal bones and the external and middle cuneiform bones. The internal cuneiform was sawn through. The calcaneo-cuboid and astragalo-scaphoid articulations were thus left undistui'bed. The wound healed in three months. Before the operation the heel was raised one inch and a half above a plane on which the toes rested; after it, the foot could be placed flat on the ground. See Pitcaim Ward Book, vol. v, p. 161.

An aneurism, arising from the anterior part of the dilatation, has protruded through the ribs and strenum. Presented by D. Fox, Esq. 99. Cast of a Neck, with a swelling produced by an aneurism of the lower part of the left common carotid artery. 100. Model of a Leg, in which extensive sloughing took place after ligature of the femoral artery. The ligature was applied in a case of aneurism, following a wound by which it is probable that the femoral vein, as well as the artery, was injured. DISEASES OF VEINS. 101. Cast of part of a man's Trunk. In consequence, apparently, of obstruction of the right jugular and subclavian veins, the superficial veins upon the right side of the front of the chest and abdomen were very large and tortuous. Through them the blood was carried from the right upper extremity and the right side of the head and face, towards the inferior vena cava. DISEASES OF THE NOSE, MOUTH, AND TONGUE. 102. Cast of part of the Face of a woman, in whom a new nose was made with a portion of skin from the forehead. The operation was performed by Mr. Vincent. 102a.

Cast of an Upper Jaw with a perforation of the hard palate from syphilitic necrosis. 112. Cast of an Upper Jaw, showing the gap left by the necrosis of a portion of the alveolus after scarlet fever. 113. A similar Specimen. The necrosis was the result of syphilis. 114. Cast of the Upper Jaw of an old man, showing complete absorption of the hard palate. He suffered from a perforation of the hard palate, which he plugged with a pad of calico, m order to prevent the passage of food into the nares. The continuous enlargement of the opening, from absorption, necessitated a corresponding enlargement of the plug, thus producing the result shown in the Specimen. 115. Cast of an Upper Jaw after the removal of the right superior maxilla. 116. Cast of an Upper Jaw, with an epulis springing up between the first and second left incisor teeth.

She died extremely emaciated after two or three years' illness. Presented by D. H. Gabb, Esq. 140. Cast of a Neck, showing several rounded prominences due to infiltration of the cervical lymphatic glands with an Osteoid Growth. From a man who had long suffered from osteo-arthritis ; he died from an Osteoid Growth (osteo-sarcoma?) affecting the sternum, ribs, right clavicle, lymphatic glands of the neck and mediastinum, and the liver.

Cast of part of a Boy's Forehead, in whom, after fracture of the skull, the brain protruded. The surface, however, healed over perfectly, and he lived in good health for many years after the injury. Presented by J. S. Hichens, Esq. DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 145. Xeroderma (Ichthyosis simplex). Cast of a Fore-arm and Hand taken from a young woman, aged 23 years. She was spare and fair-haired, never very robust, but not delicate. The disease existed from the time of birth. A sister and brother, aged 39 and 27 years, were similarly affected. Affection most marked on trunk and lower limbs ; skin of face very smooth, with tendency to crack and peel off, like layers of collodion. Hands and fingers small, skin very hard and horny, and tightly bound down. Palms especially rough and hard, although no manual labour had ever been performed. No want of development in metacarpus, as observed in some of these cases by Sir Erasmus Wilson. Proxi- mal phalanges seem unduly small. See St. Bartholomeio's Hospital Reports, vol. viii, p. 52, 1872. 146. 147. Ichthyosis Cornea (Hystrix). Two Casts taken from a lad, aged 13, years, the subject of this affection from time of birth. He had lived in the country all his life ; was well grown and well nourished ; hair light. At birth, small red spots were noticed upon the body ; in three days there was " heaping up" upon them. The disease is especially developed upon the limbs, where it runs in linear masses, raised about a quarter of an inch from the unaffected skin. On the trunk are patches and streaks of xeroderma and slightly developed papillary ichthyosis, though nowhere, in this minor form, of a brown or grey colour. At intervals, upon the arms are spurs, of a horny nature, more than a quarter of an inch in length, and slightly curved. One spur is situated on the prepuce, like the claw of a kitten. There is a certain amount of symmetry as to the affection on the limbs. The elbows and knees are especially covered; and very dense growths have occurred in these parts, horny processes being set in close series, slightly movable upon their bases. The distal phalanx of the right little finger is incurved, as the result of an early injury. The palms of the hands are much affected, and the epidermis is thickened; the soles are merely thickened, and present no papillary ridges. The hands' are some- what small. There is a brown, fimbriated patch upon the umbilicus. Brown patches are found around and upon the nose and mouth, on the helices and lobules of the ears, and around the neck. A dense, prominent cluster is situated on either fold of the nates. The mouth,- tongue, gums, and scalp are not574 CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. affected. There was no family history of any cutaneous abnormality. The grouped masses upon the knees, etc., singularly resemble clusters of Balanidce, as met with upon marine rocks. 148. Cast of the Face of a young man, aged 20 years, affected with Elephantiasis Graecorum (True Leprosy). He was born in Madras of parents of French extraction. Symptoms of leprosy first appeared -when he was 12 years old. See an account of the case by Dr. Dyce Duckworth in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. x, p. 279. 149. Cast of the Arm of the same patient. 150. Cast of a Scrotum affected with Elephantiasis, from a man, aged 40 years. The disease had existed for fifteen years, and during the whole period had steadily increased. The mass was forty inches in circumfei'ence, and weighed sixty pounds. 151. Cast of a Lower Extremity, enormously enlarged by Elephantiasis. 152. Cast of a Leg and Foot. The back and sides of the foot are greatly en- larged, with a change of structure in the subcutaneous tissue, which resembled that of elephantiasis. Presented by Page N. Scott, Esq. 153. True Keloid of Alibert. Cast taken from the steraal region of a gentleman, aged 65, who suffered from keloid for forty years—the longest recorded period of the duration of the disease. There was no history whatever of any pre- existing cicatrix, and hence the disease is believed to have been of the true, spontaneous or idiopathic variety. Vide case recorded in Transactions of the Clinical Society of London, vol. hi, p. 118, 1870, and vol. xiii, p. 60, 1880. 154. Morphcea {Keloid of Addison, Scleriasis). Cast of the face of a young man, aged 20, of sallow complexion, undersized, with very little beard or whiskers. The disease came on gradually, and the change was not preceded by pain or any peculiar sensations. The patch is smooth, glossy, somewhat depressed, tense, slightly tawny and eburnated. It cannot be pinched up. The hairs have fallen out in the track of the disease, and the part no longer sweats. Sensibility is diminished over the patch. The affected region is supplied by the supra-orbital branch of the fifth nerve. Vide St. Bartholomeiv's Hospital Bports, vol. viii, p. 55, 1872. The disease began in March, 1872, and was still unaltered in June, 1873. 155. Cast of the Fore-arm and Hand of a middle-aged woman, affected with general scleroderma. The fingers, and the wrist and elbow joints, are flexed from contraction of the skin. The skin of the face and extremities was thickened, extremely tense, smooth, shining and inelastic ; the skin of the trunk was only slightly affected. 156. Casts of two Hands affected with Erythema Papulatum. 157. Lichen Ruber (Hebra). Cast of the Leg of a lad, aged 19. universally affected with this malady. He was spare and undersized. The skin was covered with a red papular eruption, from which small silvery scales were thrown off. The papules were both discrete and in groups; some coalesced. Extensor surfaces more affected than flexor. Palms and soles much thickened. No change in the nails. Exposure to cold caused the parts to become very dusky and purple. Sweating occurred only in the axillae. The hair of scalp, axillae, and pubes was unaffected, but that on the body, generally, had the characters of lanugo. Papules occurred on the cicatrices left by vaccination,575 CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. thus illustrating that other than hair-follicular structures are involved in the disorder. The greatest benefit resulted from the local use of pitch. Vide St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. viii, p. 49, 1872. A drawing of the case is preserved, No. 419. 158. Cast of an Arm affected with Eczema. 159. Eczema Papilliforme (E. papillomatosnm, B. Wilson.) This cast was taken from a woman, aged 42, the subject of polysarcia. Her girth was five feet two inches round the waist, and her weight eighteen stones. The affection began fifteen months previously, on the right leg, in the form of small spots ; blisters subsequently appeared, and a discharge commenced. Two months ago, the left leg was similarly affected for a time, but less severely. It is now quite free from the disease. There are numerous papilliform, fungating masses scattered over the surface, and foetid pus is produced in considerable quantity. The feet and ankles are cedematous. The parts are painful, with much burning and itching sensations. This cast was taken after a mass of scab, and purulent crust had been removed by diligent poulticing. The disease appears to be most frequent upon the lower extremities, and to be mainly dependent upon venous stasis and lowered vitality of tissues. 160. Cast of the Back of a child affected with Urticaria persistans vel pig- mentosa. 161. Cast of an Arm, showing extensive patches of Psoriasis (Psoriasis guttata). 162. Cast of a Leg, showing on its anterior surface several patches of Psoriasis covered with thick pyramidal crusts. 163. Casts of the Dorsal and Palmar surfaces of an Arm affected with Xan- thelasma. Vide also drawings of the eyelids from the same patient, Nos. 432, 433. 164. Tubercular Syphilide (Syphilitic Lupus). From a single woman, aged 22. There were patches also upon the back, between the shoulders. The colour was peculiarly vivid. There was no pain. The cicatrix-band in the forehead led, in common with some other points, to an erroneous early diagnosis of a lupoid affection. The patient confessed ultimately to a history of syphilis a year previously. There were no concomitants of syphilis. The frontal cicatrix was the result of an injury in childhood. 165. Same case after treatment. Vide St. Bartholomew1 s Hospital Reports, vol. viii, p. 58, 1872. 166. Cast of the Face of a woman showing the eruption produced by the adminis- tration of iodide of potassium. 167.

Fibroma Molluscum (M. fibrosum, M. simplex, M. non-contagiosum). Cast taken from a labouring man, aged 35, who had lived in London (Holloway) all his life, and who had suffered from these growths for twenty-eight years. HeCASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 576 was of low mental development. His limbs were enormons, especially the forearms and hands. The tumours were especially developed on the trunk, in front and behind ; one was on the chin. They diminished in number upon the extremities, and were all subcutaneous in the latter localities. On the body they were of all sizes, from that of a mustard seed to that of a small raisin ; but oue on the right scapular region,—which was apparently formed by a con- geries of tumours, and was shrinking,—was as large as an apricot. Some were sessile, others were more or less pedunculated. Comedones were present upon many of the tumours. The palms and soles, and palate, were free from growths. Changes had evidently occurred in many of the smaller tumours, for they were reduced to the condition (apparently by absorption) of acrochordon. 172. Cast of a Hand and Forearm of the same patient. 173. Model of a large, deep, Epitheliomatous Ulcer of the integuments below and in front of the ear of a man who had been a chimney-sweeper. 174. Cast of a hand showing an ulceration of the skin in the fork between the thumb and index finger. The ulceration extends more especially along the normal fissures of the skin. The nature of. the disease was not determined. 175. Acne Rosacea (Gutta Rosacea). Taken from a married woman, aged 29, who had always been healthy. There was no reason to suspect indulgence in strong drinks. The affection had lasted three years. The face was covered with a hideous series of purplish-red blotches and bosses, with suppuration at various points. The skin was most altered upon the chin, where an infiltration of new growth occurred, and projected for a quarter of an inch from the subjacent surface. The case corresponds to Hebra's A. rosacea of the second degree. Occa- sional outbreaks occur in this patient, though much less severe than formerly. Vide St. Bartholomew1's Hospital Reports, vol. viii, p. 57, 1872. 176. Molluscum Contagiosum. (M. Sebaceum, interdum contagiosum.) Cast taken from a young child. Two others of the family had the disease. Vide St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. viii, p. 65, 1872. 177. Model of Arms, in which the skin is affected in an extreme degree with Tinea Favus. In one arm the crusts are raised in thick heaps; in the other, the diseased skin is represented as exposed after their removal. 178.

This and the four following casts were presented by J. B. Crosse, Esq., and illustrate specimens described and represented by him in his " Essay on Inyersio Uteri." 184. Cast of an Inverted Uterus, occurring after an abortion at the end of four months of gestation. 185. Cast of a completely Inverted Uterus, taken one month after delivery, and immediately before its removal by ligature. 186. Cast of a Specimen, which was long considered to be an inverted uterus, but which on dissection proved to be " a fibrous tumour, originating just within the cervix uteri, obliterating the os uteri in its gradual progress, and at length depending in the vagina . . . and causing atrophy of the uterus."

A small tumour of about the size of a walnut had existed in this situation for twelve years,CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 571) growing very slowly, and causing very little inconvenience. Three months before the patient s admission int o the Hospital, it had grown very rapidly, and had caused severe pain. Thefcumour was laid open under the belief that it was a ganglion, connected with the sheath of the flexor tendons. Subsequently the leg was amputated. 212. Cast of a deep-seated Naevus or Vascular Tumour, occupying the side of the lower part of the face and the upper part of the neck, in a female child, aged six months. It was first observed about six weeks after birth, and was then about the size of a pea. It rapidly increased until it attained the size exhibited in the cast. It was successfully treated by the introduction of setons, which were kept in for some months before the whole tumour disappeared. Presented by Mr. Macilwain, by whom the case is described in the eighth volume of the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions. URINARY CALCULI. 213. The Cast of a Calculus, which weighed nearly fifteen ounces. It was extracted by the lateral operation from the bladder of a man, aged 26 years, who had suffered from symptoms of stone from childhood. The wound healed perfectly, and he recovered from the operation, but was never afterwards a strong man. He died some years subsequently of disease of the kidneys and lungs. 214.

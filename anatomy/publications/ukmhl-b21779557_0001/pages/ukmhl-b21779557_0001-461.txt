DISEASES- AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 2665. Glioma of the Retina around the termination of the optic nerve, and im- plicating the optic nerve itself for a considerable distance. From a child. 2666. Section of a Tumour, which filled the orbital cavity of a young subject. The tumour is a soft glioma, containing patches of extravasated blood. The eye and optic nerve are imbedded in the centre of tumour, and are themselves so filled with the new-growth that no portion of the natural structure of the eye, except the sclerotic, can be distinguished. IX- 4 2666a. A Glioma of the Retina. A vertical section through the optic nerve and eye-ball shows a firm lobular growth of a white colour, commencing at the entrance of the optic nerve, and filling the greater portion of the inferior two-thirds of the vitreous chamber, the remaining third being filled with recent flocculent lymph. The growth consists of two lobes, in distinct portions, the smaller and posterior of these, springing from the entrance of the optic nerve, has driven the choroid before it, and perforating this has spread out into the vitreous chamber as far as the posterior aspect of the lens. No trace of the retina remains. The lens was in its normal position, but has been lost. The eye was removed from a boy, aged 10, and the disease had not attracted attention until seven weeks previous to the operation. 2667. An Eye, from which all the natural structures have disappeared, giving place to a mass of whitish medullary matter. The recti muscles are connected with the upper part of this mass. ix. 5 Vide No. 3297 in Series L. OPTIC NERVE. ATROPHY. Vide Series XXXII, Nos. 2551 to 2554, and Series L, No. 3218.

The remains of the Optic Nerve, with some of the surrounding tissues, from the patient whose eye is described in No. 2629. The sheath of the optic nerve is laid open, displaying the nerve contracted within it, pale and shrivelled, and with no bulbous enlargement at its extremity. IX. 22 Vide No. 2575.

An extremely small eye removed from a girl, aged 18. When a baby the eyes were of equal size. The eye was quite blind and had latterly given her considerable pain, for which it wTas removed. The cornea is turned back to expose the pupil filled with a pyramidal cataract. 2 d 2

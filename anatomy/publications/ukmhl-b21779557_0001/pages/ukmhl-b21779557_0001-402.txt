DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS. 344 2274. Part of a Pancreas. About its centre is a large mass of bard cancer, and in other portions of the organ are smaller deposits of a medullary character. xx. 7 The other viscera presented a natural appearance. During life the symptoms led to a belief in the existence of malignant disease of the stomach. 2275. A Pancreas, in the substance of which, and near its great end, there is a circumscribed tumour. A section of the tumour shows that it consists throughout of a yellowish substance, which in its recent state was soft and of a medullary character. xx- 1 From a man aged 40. Similar tumours occupied the situation of the lymphatic glands in the neck, and elsewhere. There were also medullary deposits in the kidney. 2276. Section of a Pancreas, in which are numerous round masses of medullary and melanotic substance. In many of them the morbid substance appears to be infiltrated in the tissue of the gland; their cut surfaces present the same lobular arrangement as the surface of the gland itself. xx. 4 From the same patient as the melanotic eye, in Series XXXIII, No. 2629.

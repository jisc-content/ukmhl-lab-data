556 PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. DISEASES OF THE UTERUS AND ITS APPENDAGES. 129. A Tumour connected with the Broad Ligament. It consists entirely of dense fibrous tissue. From Specimen No. 2942. MYO-FIBEOMA OF THE UTERUS. 130. Section of a Uterine Myo-fibroma. It consists for the most part of dense fibrous tissue, intermixed with fasciculi of organic muscular fibres. DISEASES OF THE VAGINA AND EXTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION. 131. Section of an Hypertrophy of the Clitoris. It is composed of ordinary dense connective tissue covered by a thin layer of epithelium. 132. Section of a Fibro-cellular Tumour of the Labium. It is composed of inter- lacing bundles of fibrous tissue, with interspaces between the bundles, which were filled with serous fluid. Two or three cyst-like spaces may also be observed in the section, having no lining membrane. From Specimen No. 3024. 133. Section of a Myo-Fibroma removed from the wall of the Vagina. It is composed of fibrous tissue intermixed with a large proportion of organic muscular fibres. From Specimen No. 3029. DISEASES OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. GROWTHS FROM THE INTERIOR OF CYSTS. 134. A Section of a Proliferous Growth from the interior of a Cyst in the Mammary Gland. It is composed of an imitation of gland tissue, in the form of tubules and cylinders, irregularly arranged and lined with columnar epithe- lium. From Specimen No. 3147. 135. A Proliferous Growth closely resembling the preceding, but the arrange- ment of the cells around the margins of the alveoli is less regular. From Specimen No. 3148. 136. Sections of a Proliferous Growth from the interior of a Cyst in the Mam- mary Gland. It consists of irregularly-shaped alveoli, surrounded by narrow bands of fibrous tissue and enclosing cells, having the characters of epithelial cells. From Specimen No. 3149. 137. A Proliferous Growth closely resembling in microscopic characters No. 135. From Specimen No. 3151. 138. Sections of a Proliferous Growth, which consists entirely of well-formed fibrous tissue. From Specimen No. 3153. FIBRO-ADENOMATA. 139. A Fibro-adenoma of the Breast. It consists of dense well-formed fibrous

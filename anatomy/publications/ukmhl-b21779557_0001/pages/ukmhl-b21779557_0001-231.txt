SEBIES VI. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF MUSCLES, TENDONS, AND BURSiE. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF MUSCLES. FATTY DEGENERATION. 1168. A Solens Muscle, completely degenerated into fat. No muscular fibres can be discerned; in their places is a fatty tissue, like that of the ordinary healthy fat, which on the posterior part is arranged in a fasciculate manner as the mus- cular fibres were, but anteriorly appears lobulated or granular. v. 1 The gastrocnemius and other muscles of the back of the same leg were similarly altered. The muscles on its anterior part were pale and flabby. All its other parts appeared healthy. Presented by Thomas Carden, Esq. Vide Series L, No. 3219. OSSIFICATION. 1169. Part of a Vastus Internus Muscle, with the superficial and deep femoral arteries. Large portions of the muscle are ossified. The largest portion of bone lies so close to the arteries, that it probably presented during life the cha- racters of a pulsating tumour. y# 2 1170. Two thin irregular plates of Bone, which were found in the muscles close to the Femur in No. 375, Series I. A. 130 ABSCESS. 1171. Two Psoas Muscles. Externally they presented an ordinary appearance, but on cutting into them, their interior was found to be filled with dried-up pus, which occupied the large cavities shown in the preparation. These, which with their contents, usurped the place of the greater part of the muscles, were lined by an irregular, glistening membrane, of an imperfect fibrous structure, not unlike that which often walls-in a chronic abscess. y. 3(j From the body of a middle-aged man brought in for dissection. 1172. Part of the dried-up Pus removed from the cavities shown in the preceding preparation. r V 31 SLOUGHING-. US A slou^h of the Tibialis Anticus Muscle, which was separated in a case of diffuse cellulitis of the lower third of the leg, following Syme's amputation upon a man aged 53 years. 1 '

DISEASES AND INJURIES OF VEINS. 248 of the right renal vein. The left renal vein is impervious, the blood from the kidney having returned, partly by a vein passing into the suprarenal capsule, but principally by a large vessel passing downwards and backwards to a venous plexus on the sides of the vertebrae, through which the blood from the lower part of the body appears to have reached the vena azygos, which was of unusual size. The obstruction appears to have been occasioned by the organiza- tion of a clot. She suffered from dropsy about ten months before death, from which she recovered. The feet and legs were swollen for the last two months of her life. 1606. A Vena Cava Inferior obliterated. The preparation consists of the remains of the vena cava, the right kidney, and a firm ileshy tumour, which has been formed between them. A great part of the kidney is absorbed. The vena cava is obliterated from its bifurcation almost to its termination in the auricle. The upper part of the vein is distended by fibrinous substance, which appeared to have been separated from the blood. Below this the vein could not be traced ; it appeared to be completely lost in the diseased structure. xm. 29 Vide Nos. 1396, 1539, 1555.

Portion of a Vena Cava Inferior, in which there is a transverse lacerated apei-ture, about two inches above the iliac veins. xiii. 71 From the same person as the ruptured bladder, Series XXIX, No. 2441, and the ruptured intestine, Series XVIII, No. 2040. 1608. A Femoral Vein, in which, within the length of six inches, there are seven distinct lacerations through its coats. XIH. 117 The injury was produced by a cart-wheel passing oyer the thigh.

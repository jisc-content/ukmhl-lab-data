DRAWINGS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 599 From a girl, aged 16 years, who, after delirium and vomiting, became comatose and died in that condition. No structural disease of the brain or its vessels was discovered. 352. Partial softening of a Cerebrum with small effusions of blood. 353. Softening of portions of Brain Substance with small hemorrhagic effusions. In the anterior portion of the right hemisphere is a mass of yellow deposit. (T. Godart.) 354. Inflammation with plastic exudation into the substance of the left hemi- sphere of the brain. (T. Godart.) 355. Sloughing of a portion of a Brain, eleven days after a wound, and five days after ligature, of a common carotid artery. The specimen is in Scries XXX, No. 1377. The case is described by Mr. Vincent in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxxix, p. 38. 356. Abscess in a Cerebrum; the green colour of the granular internal surface of the abscess is well marked. 357. Large sloughing Abscess of the Brain after compound fracture of the skull. 358. Abscess in a hemisphere of the Brain. (T. Godart.) 359. A child affected with Paralysis and Contraction of the limbs from sclerosis of the cerebral cortex. (T. Godart.) The case is described by Dr. Norman Moore, in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports, vol. xv, 1879. 360. Another sketch of the same child. (T. Godart.) 361. The surface of the Cerebral Hemispheres from a case of Tubercular Menin- gitis. (T. Godart.) 362. Caseous Tubercular Tumour in the right Crus Cerebri. (T. Godart.) 363. Caseous Tumours of the Cerebellum and Pons Varolii. (T. Godart.) 364. Tubercular Deposits in the Pons Varolii. (T. Godart.) 365. Glioma in the left Cerebral Hemisphere. (T. Godart.) 366. A Tumour in the left Cerebral Hemisphere, pushing over the left central ganglia, and pressing on the right hemisphere. (T. Godart.) 367. A New-Growth, occupying the left Optic Thalamus. (T. Godart.) 368. Masses of New-Growth in the Cerebrum. (T. Godart.) 369. Tumour of uncertain nature, in a Cerebrum. 370. Tumour, probably of sarcomatous structure, attached to the cerebellar surface of a petrous bone, and pressing upon the cerebellum. (H. B. Dobell.) From a Specimen in Series XXX, No. 2469. 371. A Cyst in the Pineal Gland from a fatal case of convulsions (? epileptic). The only lesion found. (T. Godart.) 372. Portion of a Brain, with loose vascular tissue filling up a space from which a large portion was lost from hernia cerebri. The patient died thirty years after the injury.

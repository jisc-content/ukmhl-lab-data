598 DRAWINGS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 334. Anaemia of a Brain, with haemorrhage in the arachnoid sac, in a case of Purpura. 335. Purulent infiltration into part of a Pia Mater. 335a. A Brain, with a very thick layer of pus effused upon its surface. (T. Godart.) From a boy aged 3 years. A small collection of pus was found in the mastoid cells. 336. Effusion of Lymph over a Pons Varolii. 337. Medullary Cancer of the Dura Mater, affecting the inner table of the skull- cap. (T. Godart.) Vide Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xx, p. 325. 338. Atrophy of the Corpus Striatum and Optic Thalamus on the right side. (T. Godart.) From a female, aged 20 years. The right middle cerebral artery was obliterated, and there was extensive disease of, with vegetations on, the mitral and aortic valves. Hemiplegia had existed for the last three years of life. 339. Cerebral Apoplexy, with ecchymosis, softening, and discoloration of the adjacent part of the brain. (T. Godart.) 340. Apoplexy, in which blood effused into the optic thalamus appeared to have subsequently escaped into the lateral ventricle through a small round aperture. (T. Godart.) 341. Blood extravasated into the substance of the Cerebral Hemisphere, and into the Corpus Callosum, the coagula extending into the ventricles of the brain. (T. Godart.) 342. Apoplexy with laceration of the under surface of the right middle lobe of the Brain. (T. Godart.) 343. Left Hemisphere of the Brain. Situated posteriorly near the median fissure a recent extravasation of blood is depicted, and beneath the red vascular patch on the surface of the hemisphere was an older extravasation. (T. Godart.) From a female, aged 53 years. 344. Effusion of blood into the substance of the Pons Varolii, Crura Cerebri, and into the fourth Ventricle. (T. Godart.) 345. An Apoplectic Clot in the Pons Varolii and Crura Cerebri. (T. Godart.) 346. An Apoplectic Clot in the Pons Varolii and floor of the fourth Ventricle. 347. Recent Haemorrhage into the substance of the Pons Varolii. (T. Godart.) 348. Old partially decolorised Clot in the substance of the Optic Thalamus. (T. Godart.) 349. Blood extravasated into the cerebral hemispheres in various stages of absorption. (T. Godart.) 350. Cerebral Apoplexy ; there was an effusion of five ounces of blood from rupture of a small aneurism of a middle cerebral artery. The Specimens are in Series VIII, Nos. 1518, 1519. 351. Extreme Congestion of the Brain and its Membranes. (T. Godart.)

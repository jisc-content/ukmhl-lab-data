DISEASES OF BONES. 26 the shaft around the dead portion, and is invested by the original periosteum. The new bone is soft, spongy, and vascular. A portion of the periosteum has been reflected from the upper part of the shaft, to exhibit the formation of new bone beneath it. I* ^18 197. The other section of the Tibia and part of the Fibula from the same limb, as the preceding specimen, after maceration. An inch of the extremity of the fibula has perished. The surface of the adjacent part of the shaft is covered by new bone, which is especially abundant at the lower part, and has coalesced with the new bone on the corresponding part of the tibia. A part of the new bone has been separated from the shaft of the tibia, to show that it was all formed in the periosteum, or between it and the surface of the old bone, and that the latter is unaltered. !• -19 For other Specimens of Necrosis after Fracture see Series III, Nos. 866 to 875. 198. Necrosed bone removed from a cavity which had formed within an anchylosed ankle-joint after a severe compound fracture. n. 69 It had been a source of constant suffering for many years preceding its removal. 199. Portion of a Tibia which separated after necrosis. I. 67 200. Part of a Tibia, two portions of which, each including both compact and cancellous tissue, have perished and were in process of separation by gi-ooves bt-ino- formed around them. Previous to the necrosis these portions had been irregularly ulcerated on their surfaces and consolidated in their internal struc- ture" by thickening and union of their lamellae. All the parts of the bone inter- vening between the necrosed portions are thickened and indurated. a. 122 (In Case F.) . The patient was a man about 50 years old. The disease had made slow progress for many vears before the removal of the limb.

NECROSIS OF THE SUPERFICIAL OR COMPACT LAYER. 201. A Skull-cap, showing Necrosis of a portion of the outer table of the frontal bone. There is a groove around the dead portion of bone. Ulceration with irregular superficial necrosis of the left parietal bone is also seen. A. 110 (In Case F.) 202 Portion of a Parietal Bone, which separated in consequence of Necrosis. i. 205 203. Portions of necrosed Bone removed from the margin of the foramen magnum; one portion included the posterior third of the foramen, the other contains the right posterior condyloid foramen. Taken from a man, aged 27, who fell heavily on the back of his head six years before his admission to the hospital. The injury was followed by constant pain and stiffness about the back of the head and neck. Ten months later abscesses formed and discharged in the same region. When admitted to the hospital the right side of the tongue was exceedingly wasted and shrunken, and when protruded, the organ was directed towards the right side. Its sensa- tion was unimpaired ; the speech was thick. The pieces of necrosed bone preserved were removed by operation, and the patient recovered. In six months the right side of the tongue had nearly regained its normal size and power.—See Clinical Society's Transactions, vol. iii, p. 238. 204. Portion of a Femur, in which there has been Necrosis of the posterior wall of the lower part of the shaft. The dead bone was separated, but was held by a bridge of new bone formed across it. In the adjacent part of the shaft the walls are thickened, the cancellous tissue is nearly consolidated, and there is irrco-ular ulceration above and upon the condyles. A. 96 (In Case F.)

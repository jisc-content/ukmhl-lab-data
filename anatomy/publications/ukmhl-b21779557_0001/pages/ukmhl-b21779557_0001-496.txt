The posterior and upper wall of the bladder was broken down, and its contents were prevented from extravasation into the abdominal cavity only by recent circumscribed peritoneal adhesions. The urethra was sound. The spongy and cavernous portions of the penis are infiltrated throughout with a firm homogeneous material of a dull white colour, exuding a fluid ou section. It presented the appearance and minute structure of hard cancer. The glans was the seat of superficial cancerous ulceration. The right kidney consisted merely of a dilated sac. The left was enlarged, but natural. There were cancerous deposits with the same anatomical characters, though softer, in the lungs, bronchial and lumbar glands; also between the periosteum and the front surface of the tibia, amongst the bones of the tarsus of the same leg, and in the sheath of the peronei tendons. The disease of the penis was of eighteen months' duration. The tumours in the skin had existed eight months. During life, there was no evidence of any of the other deposits.

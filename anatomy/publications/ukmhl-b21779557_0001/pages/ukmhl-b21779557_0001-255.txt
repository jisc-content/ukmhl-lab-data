PERICARDIUM AND OF THE HEART. 197 The pal Lent, a girl 21 years old, was admitted in a state of extreme debility. She had violent palpitation of the heart, and a lond bellovvs-sonnd, accompanying the first sound of the heart, was heard most distinctly at the base, and in a line extending thence upwards and to the left. She died exhausted; with old coagula, filling many of the branches of the pulmonary artery, and with pulmonary apoplexy, of which specimens are preserved in No. 1705, Series XI. The case is related by Sir J. Paget, in the Medico- Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xxvii, p. 182. London, 1317. A Heart, greatly enlarged, and with only two pulmonary valves. Both these valves are slightly thickened and opaque, and have large masses of fibrin mxsed with earthy matter attached to their free borders. One of these masses, three-quarters of an inch in length, hangs into the cavity of the ventricle, and appears, by its weight, to have elongated and drawn out the narrow portion of the edge of the valve to which it is attached. All the other valves are slightly opaque, but thm and pliant. There is a small granular patch of fibrin deposited on the posterior surface of one portion of the mitral valve. xn. 68 1318. The Heart, laid open, of a woman, aged 24, who was born deaf and dumb, lhe pulmonary valves are much thickened, apparently by deposits in the substance of the cusps. Their surfaces also are roughened. All the other valves are apparently healthy. The cavity of the left ventricle at its apex was occupied by a firm laminated mass, which lay in front of the endocardium, and was therefore probably an old clot. 1319. Part of an exceedingly large Heart. There are only two pulmonary and I iro aortic valves, but they are all of large size.

SERIES LVI. CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. DISEASES OF BONES. 1. Cast of a Head, in which the bones are extremely thickened, with changes of structure similar to that shown in Series I, No. 72. 2. Cast of a Leg, showing great thickening of the Tibia, and a well-marked curvature of the bone with the convexity forwards. The other leg was similarly affected. From a girl, aged 16 years, whose legs did not become affected until she was 9 years old. At the time the cast was taken there was no pain or tenderness of the tibia and the deformity was not increasing. There was no evidence of congenital syphilis ; none of the other bones were affected, nor were the ribs beaded. 2a. Cast of a Leg, the Tibia of which is thickened and curved with the convexity in the anterior direction. There was no evidence of congenital syphilis. 3. Cast of a Foot and Ankle, showing a peculiar deformity, due to the abnormal prominence of the malleoli. On a level with the epiphysial line at the lower extremity of the fibula, is a smooth nodular outgrowth of bone. The whole of the internal malleolus is greatly and uniformily enlarged, and there is also a slight separate outgrowth at the level of the epiphysial line. From a boy, aged 9 years. 4.

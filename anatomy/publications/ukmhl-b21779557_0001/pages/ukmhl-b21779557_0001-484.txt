SERIES XXXVIII. DISEASES OF THE VESIOULiE SEMINALES, AND VASA DEFERENTIA, 2827.

OBLITERATION OF THE VAS DEFERENS. Vide No. 2782, Series XXXVI. 2828. A Bladder, to the posterior part of which a cyst is attached, which contained hydatids. The vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia are closely connected with the cyst; and the lower part of the right vas deferens communicates with it by two orifices into which a bristle is passed. A portion of this vas deferens is wanting; and it appeared that the cyst might have originated in the dilatation of the deficient portion of the tube. The walls of the cyst are thin, but tough and firm; the hydatids found within it are at the bottom of the bottle. xxix. 15

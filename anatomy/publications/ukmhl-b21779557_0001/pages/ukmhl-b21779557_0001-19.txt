ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL MUSEUM. XV At a General Court held on the 22nd of July, 1829, Mr. Stanley, on behalf of John Abernethy, Esq., and himself, attended and presented to this Court a Catalogue of the Preparations, &c., con- tained in the Museum of this Hospital, when it was resolved, " That five hundred copies of the Catalogue be printed, under the direction of Mr. Stanley." At a General Court held on the 27th of July, 1831, Mr. Stanley attended and presented to this Court a printed Catalogue of the Preparations, &c., contained in the Museum of this Hospital, which was referred to the House Committee. At a House Committee held on the 8th of July, 1845, the following Report was received from the Medical Officers respecting the Anatomical Museum:— " The Medical Officers desire to draw the attention of the Committee to the present state of the Catalogues of the Anatomical Museum," .... " And beg to submit to the Committee the propriety of causing a new Catalogue to be printed, in which the descriptions of all the specimens added to the Museum, since the printing of the Catalogue of 1831, should be included, and such alterations as are necessary in that Catalogue, should be made." Whereupon it was resolved :— " That a new Catologue of the Museum be printed, agreeably to the suggestion of the Medical Officers, under the direction of the Treasurer and Almoners." Which Resolution was confirmed at the next following General Court of Governors. At a Committee of the Treasurer and Almoners held on the 17th of September, 1846, "Mr. Paget presented a copy of the new Catalogue of the Museum, printed under their direction: whereupon it was resolved that the Cata- logue be forthwith published." At a House Committee held on the 8th of July, 1851, a letter was read from Mr. Paget, requesting permission to commence the piinting, and to make arrangements for the publication of the nearly completed Second Volume of the New Edition of the Catalogue of the Anatomical Museum

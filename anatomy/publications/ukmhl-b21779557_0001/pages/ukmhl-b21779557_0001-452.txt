Staphyloma of the Sclerotic. The choroid has been separated from the sclerotic by fluid; the lamina fusca is much thickened, and condensed, so as to form a distinct cyst wall: the retina is detached, and encloses some shrivelled remains of the vitreous humour; some chalky tissue represents the remains of the lens. The eye was removed from a middle-aged man on account of disfigurement, having been blind from an injury inflicted in childhood. 2600.

TUMOURS OF THE SCLEROTIC. FIBRO-CELLULAE. 2601. The Eye of an Ox, on the anterior part of which is a Tumour with hair growing from it. The tumour, which appeared to be composed of fat and con- densed cellular tissue covered by skin, grew from the outer half of the cornea and sclerotic. The conjunctiva appeared to be lost in the integument which enveloped the tumour. Long hairs, with true bulbs, grew from the skin on . the surface of the tumour. The cornea, where not covered by the diseased growth, was transparent and of its natural thickness and structure : the iris and lens were likewise healthy. ix. 21 IRIS. IRITIS AND ITS EFFECTS. 2602. An Eye, in which the iris is thick and opaque : a portion of it also was adherent to the cornea. ix. 3 2603. An Eyeball laid open, showing complete atrophy of the iris, with loss of the uveal pigment. The front of the iris is everywhere adherent to the cornea. ix. 33 Vide No. 2587. 2604. The anterior half of the Coats of an Eyeball turned inside out. The posterior surface of the iris is completely covered with flocculent lymph. The patient, aged 45, had long been under observation for chronic iritis. The eye was removed on account of constant and severe pain. The choroid was healthy. Vide Nos. 2580, 2586, 2661, 2662. ANTERIOR SYNECHIA. 2605. An Eye, in which the greater part of the pupillary margin of the iris is adherent to the cornea. ix. 1 Vide Nos. 2581, 2602, 2603. TUMOURS OF THE IRIS. 2606.

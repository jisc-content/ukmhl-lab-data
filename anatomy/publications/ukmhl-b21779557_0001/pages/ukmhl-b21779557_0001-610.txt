552 PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. From Specimen No. 2499. INFLAMMATION. 92. Section of a Kidney affected with acute Parenchymatous Nephritis (large white kidney). The epithelium of the tubules, especially in the cortical por- tion, is swollen, cloudy, and finely granular; and there is an abundant exudation of leucocytes between the tubules, and both around and within the glomeruli. 93. A similar Specimen from a case of Nephritis following scarlet fever. TUMOURS. CYSTIC DISEASE. 94. Sections of the Kidneys of an adult, affected in an advanced degree with cystic degeneration. From Specimens Nos. 2382, 2383, in the description of which an account of the microscopic appearances is given. CANCER. 95. Cancer of a Kidney. The section shows trabecule of connective tissue covered by, and enclosing, large epithelial-like cells, in many instances multi- nuclear. From Specimen No. 2390. DISEASES OF THE BRAIN AND DURA MATER. DURA MATER. SYPHILIS. 96. Section of a small Syphilitic Gumma occupying the substance of the Dura Mater. From Specimen No. 2457a. TUBERCLE. 97. Sections of a small mass of Tubercle situated upon the Dura Mater. From Specimen No. 2458. CANCER. 98. Section of a Tumour situated upon the Dura Mater, having the characters of a scirrhous Cancer. It consists of coarse fibrous tissue, enclosing alveoli filled with small cells. From Specimen No. 2468. THE BRAIN. TUBERCLE. 99. Section of a Caseous Tumour of the Medulla Oblongata. Its microscopic characters are given iij the description of the Specimen No. 2492. TUMOURS. SARCOMATA. 100. Section of a Glioma occupying the Optic Commissure. It is composed of delicate connective tissue, in places having a reticular arrangement, and en- closing in its meshes numerous small nuclei. From Specimen No. 2497. 101. A similar Specimen, but the reticular arrangement of the connective tissue is absent. From Specimen No. 2498. 102. Section of a Tumour of the Brain, probably a round-cell Sarcoma.

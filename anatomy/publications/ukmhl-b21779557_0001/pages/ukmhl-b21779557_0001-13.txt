PREFACE TO THE CATALOGUE OF 1 8 4 6. Since the former Catalogue was printed, in 1831, 1,035 preparations have been added to the Pathological division of the Museum. In the formation of the present Catalogue all the descriptions, whether printed in the former one or added to it from year to year in manuscript, have been revised and reconsidered; many of them have been extended; some have been corrected. In all the instances in which it was possible brief histories of the cases have been added to the descriptions of the specimens, together with references to more detailed accounts of them recorded in the Case-Books belonging to the Museum. The general rules of description and the arrangement of the speci- mens adopted by Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Stanley have been but Hitle deviated from. The arrangement appears to be the most convenient for a Museum to which every year brings numerous additions, such as it would be difficult to insert in appropriate places, in a more minute classification But the advantages of an arrangement founded on principles of Pathology are sought to be attained by adding tables of reference to the descriptions of each series. By the help of these tables it will be easy both to find any specimen in the Museum, and to study the preparations in each series in the order in which they may best serve for illustrations of the diseases of the part to which that series is devoted. The following general Table of References is inserted in order tint certain specimens dispersed among the numerous divisions of the Museum

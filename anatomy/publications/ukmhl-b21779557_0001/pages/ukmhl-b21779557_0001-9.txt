PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE. During the twenty years which have elapsed since the publication of the Appendix to the former Catalogue, more than nine hundred new specimens, forty-four Calculi, over four hundred Drawings, about one hundred Casts and Models, and a collection of nearly two hundred microscopic specimens of Morbid Anatomy, have been added to the Pathological Collection. The Series of Diseases of the Generative Organs and of Deformities of the Pelvis in the Female, have been enriched by the presentation of the collection of Dr. Matthews Duncan in June, 1879. The whole Pathological Collection has been. completely rearranged and renumbered. The anatomical grouping of the Series' of Diseases and Injuries of the various Organs and Structures of the Body has not been materially altered; but in each Series the specimens have been arranged according to a uniform pathological classification. The dry specimens, formerly placed in separate Series, have been interspersed among those preserved in bottles, with the purpose of illustrating more fully the diseases or injuries which they exhibit. Eighty-eight selected specimens from Dr. J. R. Farre's collection have been included in the general Catalogue. All the descriptions have been revised and collated, and some of them amended or extended. The specimens are now numbered consecutively throughout the collection. • L MD^nti°!l0f f6 mici'°ec°Pic chara<^ <*n*V of the specimens of Morbid Growths have been inserted; some of them were examined by myself and others by Mr. Walsham, who presented his microscopic pre- parations to the Museum.

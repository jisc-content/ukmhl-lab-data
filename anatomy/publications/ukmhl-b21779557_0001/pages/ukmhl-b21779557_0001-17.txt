ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. Extracts from the Reports of the Proceedings of General Courts and Committees of the Governors of the Hospital, respecting the Catalogues thereof. The earliest record of the existence of a Museum is in 1726, when a room was provided by the Governors as a " Repository for Anatomical or Chirurgical Preparations," which was placed under the charge of John Freke, Junior Assistant Surgeon to the Hospital. It was ordered* " that whatever preparation shall be given to the Repository, shall be num- bered and the name of the person who gave it, and the history be entered in a Book to be kept at the Compting House." This Record Book is not extant. The earliest specimens of which the origin is known, are, a Congenital Hernia, dissected by Percivall Pott, and a Specimen of Angular Curva- ture of the Spine, from " a patient who was under the care of Mr. Pott." The Specimen of Congenital Hernia was probably prepared before 1756, when Pott published his Essay on that affection. But whether these Specimens were preserved in the Museum of the Medical School, or formed part of a Private Collection made by Pott, and presented by him to Abernethy, it is impossible to say. The latter supposition is not improbable, as there are two crania affected with syphilis in the Museum, which were given by Pott to Abernethy. At a House Committee, held on April 18th, 1821, Mr. Abernethy, in a series of representations urging the Governors to rebuild the Anatomical Theatre, offered to make over his valuable Collection of Specimens of -various Diseases and Injuries" to the Hospital, in trust for the use of the Medical School. This collection amounted "in number to several thousands." * Extract from the Mimites of the Governors, June 23rd 1726.

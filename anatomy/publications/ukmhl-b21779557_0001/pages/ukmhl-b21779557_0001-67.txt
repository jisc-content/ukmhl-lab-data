DISEASES OF BONES. 9 cancellous texture. The substance of the bone has undergone no further alteration than the exudation of pus into it, and an increase of its vascularity. i. 47 61. Part of a Tibia showing circumscribed Osteo-Myelitis, the situation of which is indicated by increased vascularity of the medulla and partial destruction of the cancellous tissue. The periosteum is not so strongly united to the bone as in the natural state; it has been partially reflected, to show its vascularity and softened texture, opposite to, and some distance above and below, the situation of the inflammation. There is a narrow ulcerated aperture in the integuments over the tibia leading to a slight superficial ulceration of its outer wall. J 62.

The periosteum is thickened and for the most part adherent to the bone. There is a slight and irregular forma- tion ot sub-periosteal bone on the posterior surface of the shaft. The section Of the bone shows both rarefaction and condensation, the latter preponderating The rare taction is confined to a thin layer, extending along the anterior surface of the shaft and to the neighbourhood of the junction of the epiphvses with the d.aphysis.

INJURIES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 316 before the death of the child, in the endeavour to administer an enema, a clyster- pipe was forced through the adjacent walls of the rectum and vagina. At the part thus injured there is a small depression in the wall of the vagina, and a long, pale, and irregular cicatrix in that of the rectum. Near this cicatrix also there are traces of small healed ulcers of the mucous membrane of the rectum. Just below the cicatrix, at a distance of about an inch from the margin of the anus, the canal of the rectum is reduced to an eighth of an inch in diameter, and the adjacent tissues are indurated. Above this stricture the intestine is greatly dilated; below, it is of natural size. A portion of the large intestine is pre- served in No. 1952. xvi. 93 EXCISION OF THE RECTUM. 2080.

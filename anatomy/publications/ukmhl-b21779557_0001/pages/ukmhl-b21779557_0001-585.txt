URINARY CALCULI. 527 CALCULI HAVING TWO LAYERS. OXALATE OF LIME. TJRIO ACID. 137. A Calculus, removed from the bladder of a man. The great mass of the calculus is Uric Acid; it contains, however, traces of Phosphate, and of Oxalate of Lime. The centre is Oxalate of Lime, with a small quantity of Uric Acid. The whole is composed of Oxalate of Lime 5 parts, Uric Acid 95 parts, = 100. 138. Section of a Calculus. Uric Acid upon a Nucleus of Oxalate of Lime. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a boy 9 years old. Presented by H. Earle, Esq. 139. Section of a Calculus. Uric Acid upon a Nucleus of Oxalate of Lime. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From tbe bladder of a boy 7 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Earle. 140. Sections of a Calculus. Oxalate of Lime, surrounded by Uric Acid. From the bladder of a boy 8 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Wormald. OXALATE OF LIME. URATE OF AMMONIA. 141. Section of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; the external strata Urate of Ammonia with a little Phosphate and Oxalate of Lime. OXALATE OF LIME. EARTHY PHOSPHATES. 142. Section of a Calculus removed from a woman, aged 44 years, through the Urethra, which was previously rapidly dilated. Symptoms of stone had existed for four or five months previously. She rapidly recovered the power of retaining the urine, and soon left the Hospital quite well. The central portion is composed of Oxalate of Lime, the white circumferential layer of Phosphates. 143. Section of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime, with a deposition of the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a boy 10 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Vincent. 144. Section of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; with a crust of the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a boy 10 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Vincent. 145. Sections of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime ; outer white layer, the Phosphates. From a young man. Lithotomy by Sir Wm. Lawrence. 146. Section of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; surrounded by the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a female. Lithotomy by Mr. Stanley. 147. Section of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; with a crust of the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. 148. A Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime ; with a crust of the Fusible Calculus Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a lad 16Â£ years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Vincent.

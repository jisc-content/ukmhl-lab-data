140 INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). through the shaft of a bone, in accordance with the spiral arrangement of the fibres of the matrix of the osseous tissue. (In Case H.) Presented by Thomas Smith, Esq. 973. Portions of a Femur, exhibiting the union of a comminuted fracture in the upper part of its shaft. The principal fracture appears to have extended, obliquely downwards from the trochanter minor. The fracture is firmly united, the upper fragment lying in front of the lower. The cancellous texture of the bone is continuous in the united fragments. C. 71 (In Case H.) 974. A Femur, which was fractured through the middle of its shaft. The fracture is firmly and smoothly united, with the upper portion of the bone projecting slightly forwards, and the lower portion rotated outwards. C. 84 (In Case H.) 975. Sections of a Femur, which has been fractured about four inches below its upper end. The fracture is firmly united with some displacement of the ends of the bone, and the walls and cancellous tissue of the two portions have coalesced and become continuous. C. 16 (In Case H.) 976. Section of a Femur, in which there was an oblique fracture through the shaft near the condyles. The upper portion of the bone projects far down in front and on the inner side of the lower portion; but their adjacent surfaces are firmly united by intermediate new bone. ill. 103 For other Specimens of Fracture of the Shaft of the Femur, see Nos. 746, 750, 754, 755, 759, 765, 766, 783, 784, 797, 802 to 804, 810 to 813, 815, 816, 817, 819 to 823, 826, and 831. Lower Extremity of Femur. 977. The Lower two-thirds of the shaft of a Femur, showing a comminuted fracture of the lower end of the shaft and of the epiphysis, extending into the knee-joint. The fracture extends nearly vertically along the centre of the shaft to the junction of the lower with the middle third; midway it is joined by a lateral fracture. The fractured surfaces are partially united. Above the upper limit of the fracture is a projecting fragment of new bone, probably formed by a portion of uptorn periosteum. The condyles of the femur are separated, and the anterior portion of the articular surface is detached from them. in. 129 978. Portion of a Femur, showing a comminuted fracture at the lower extremity, which extends down between the condyles into the knee-joint. C. 15 (In Case H.) 979. Portion of a Femur, fractured transversely into many small pieces, just above the condyles. From inflammation in the knee-joint, there has been deep and extensive ulceration of the articular surfaces of the condyles of the femur. c. 14 (In Case H.) 980. Portion of a Femur, which has been fractured in its lower part. The fracture extends transversely through the shaft, and obliquely between the condyles into the knee-joint. The lower end of the shaft is driven-in between the displaced and separated condyles. C. 12 (In Case H.) For other Specimens, vide Nos. 747, 756, 757, 823. Separation of the Lower Epiphysis. 981. Portion of a Femur, exhibiting a separation of its shaft from the lower

586 DRAWINGS OP DISEASED OR INJURED PARTS. 92. Medullary Cancerous Tumour, extending from the endocardium into a right ventricle. The case is related by Dr. Ormerod in the Medico-CMrurgical Transactions, vol. xxx, p. 39. The Specimen is preserved and described in Series VII, No. 1286. 93. Acephalocyst Hydatids in the Wall of a Right Ventricle near the apex of a Heart. (W. J. Bayntin). Prom the specimen in Series VII, No. 1295. 94. Vegetations upon the Mitral Valve, with large blood-vessels ramifying upon its auricular surface. Recent rheumatic endocarditis. (T. Godart.) 95. Vegetations, with deposits of Fibrin upon the endocardial surface of the left auricle, and upon the mitral valve. Ragged shreds of fibrin project from the valve into the interior of tbe ventricle. (T. Godart.) 96. Ulceration of, with Vegetations on the posterior cusp of Mitral Valve. (T. Godart.) 97. Acute Rbeumatic Inflammation of the Aortic Valves. 98. Aortic and Mitral Valves, showing inflammatory deposits in process of absorption. (T. Godart.) 99. (a.) Vegetation on the Aortic Valves, (b.) A firm clot in the axillary artery, with (c) discoloration of the skin over it. (T. Godart.) 100. Left Ventricle and Aorta. The aortic valves are ulcerated and disorganised; to one cusp a mass of fibrin is adherent, which formed the lowest part of a long fibrinous clot extending up the aorta. (T. Godart.) Vide Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xix, p. 146. 101. Congestion of the Skin of the Face and Arms, from obstruction of the circu- lation by disease, and, perhaps, malformation of the heart. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 102. Atheroma of the Aorta with thickened and contracted semilunar valves. (T. Godart.) 103. Extensive Atheroma of the Pulmonary artery in connection with mitral disease and hypertrophy of the right ventricle. The aorta was almost healthy. (T. Godart.) 104. Calcareous Degeneration of Atheromatous Deposits in the walls of an abdo- minal aorta. (T. Godart.) 105. An Aneurism of the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta bulging forward from the chest wall. (T. Godart.) 106. An Aneurism of the Axillary Artery filled with blood-clot after ligature of the subclavian artery. (T. Godart.) From a man, aged 32 years, -who died of pyamiia twenty days after the operation. The Specimen is preserved in Series VIII, No. 1515. 107. Arterial Angioma, so-called Aneurism by anastomosis of the arteries of the scalp. 108. Obstructed Middle Cerebral Artery, associated with deposits upon the valves of the heart. (T. Godart.)

199 PERICARDIUM AND OF THE HEART. 1327. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening and opacity of the mitral valve. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is contracted into a narrow crescentic fissure. The cavity of the left auricle is much enlarged, and its walls are thickened. The right ventricle is also dilated, but its walls are not increased in thickness. xn. 24 1328. Part of a Heart, exhibiting thickening, opacity, and rigidity of the mitral valve and its tendinous cords. The left auriculo-ventricular opening has the form of a narrow crescentic opening, with the horns of the crescent directed, as usual, towards the aortic valves. xn. 26 1329. A similar preparation. 35 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. 1330. A Heart, showing a probably congenital union of the margins of the two cusps of the mitral valve, leaving an opening nearly as large as a threepenny piece between the two cusps. Projecting into this opening and forming its outer boundary, is a small cusp which appears to be an exaggeration of the minute cusps found between the large cusps of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The bond of union between the cusps is thin and membranous, except at the margin of the opening, where it is thick and strengthened by fibrous tissue. Chorda3 tendineas are attached all around the margin of the interval between the cusps. A small tuft of vegetation is attached to the minute cusp described above: a vegetation is also attached to the margin of the opening formed by the aortic cusp.

A Heart, exhibiting numerous warty masses of brown firm fibi'in on the aortic valves. Behind one of the valves the aorta is dilated into a pouch, and its inner membrane is here ulcerated. There are but two valves; both are of unusually large size, thick, opaque, and somewhat re-curved. xii. 17 From a man aged 25 years. 1332. The commencement of the Aorta and adjacent portion of the left ventricle. To the semilunar valves large and numerous vegetations are attached, some of which are pendulous. The right femoral artery containing an embolon is preserved in No. 1561. 1333. Aortic Valves, with numerous firm, pale, warty excrescences or vegetations attached to their free borders, and to parts of their adjacent surfaces. xn. 20 1334. Aortic Valves, with numerous similar excrescences attached to their sur- faces. _ One of the valves is extensively ulcerated, and is of very large size, comprising the extent of two valves incompletely subdivided. xn. 21 1335. Aortic Valves, in one of which ulceration has destroyed more than half its border of attachment. The ulceration has extended also to the adjacent muscular substance of the heart, and fibrinous deposits are adherent to its rough surface. The aorta appears healthy. xir Â§q 1336. Aortic Valves, diseased like those last described, but more extensively Ulceration has penetrated the adjacent parts of two of the valves, separating them from their attachments, and allowing their continuous free border to han* like a lax cord across the orifice of the aorta. A large piece of one valve, nearl? detached by the ulceration, hangs into the ventricle, covered with fibrinous deposits. The ulcer, in its extension from the valves, has penetrated the part of the wall of the aorta, which was beneath and between the attachments of the

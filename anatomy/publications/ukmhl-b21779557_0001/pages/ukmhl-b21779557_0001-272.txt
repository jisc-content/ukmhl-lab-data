DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 214 LIGATURE OF PARTICULAR ARTERIES IN CONTINUITY. 1415. Right Common Iliac Artery tied on account of haemorrhage from a branch of the internal iliac artery. Common Carotid Artery .—Nos. 1393, 1394, 1395, 1405, 1509, 1510. Subclavian Artery i—Nos. 1452, 1512, 1515. External Iliac Artery :—Nos. 1396, 1397,1441, 1445, 1539,1540,1551, and Series I, No. 496. Femoral Artery :—Nos. 1406, 1407, 1408, 1411, 1414, 1442, 1463, 1542a, 1543, 1546. Posterior Tibial Artery -.—No. 1380. CHANGES IN LIGATURES APPLIED TO ARTERIES. 1416. Femoral Artery and Vein from the stump of a thigh amputated through its middle, eighteen days before death. They were tied with carbolised catgut. The ligatures were cut short. No trace of them could be found on dissection. The vessels were occluded by a firm plug of clot. There had been no haemorrhage. See Lawrence Ward Boole, vol. iii, p. 33-222. 1417. A silk ligature applied to the Subclavian Artery in the third part of its course, for a large axillary aneurism. It came away with the attached slough on the twentieth day after the operation. xni. 155 DISEASES OF ARTERIES. ATHEROMA, &c. DEPOSIT OF GELATINOUS OR FATTY MATTER IN THE INNER COAT. 1418. Portion of a Carotid Artery, with its external and internal branches. Just above the division, the cavity of the internal carotid is slightly dilated, and its internal coat is thickened, opaque, white on its surface, and the seat of an abundant deposit of soft, probably fatty matter in the deeper part of its thickened substance. xiii. 44 For other specimens, see Nos. 1425, 1447, 1448, 1450, 1473, 1486, 1504, 1506, 1509, 1510, 1519, 1547. DEPOSIT OF CALCAREOUS MATTER. 1419. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta. Earthy matter is deposited in its coats in such quantity that it forms a complete tube, which is in some parts half a line in thickness. XIII. 30 1420. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, with large nodulated and granular masses of earthy matter attached to its internal surface. Around these deposits the inner membrane is thickened and opaque, and the bases of some of them are fixed on thin circular plates of earthy matter. xiii. 73 Presented by William G-illard, Esq. 1421. Portion of an Abdominal Aorta, dilated and exhibiting deposits of large masses of earthy matter on its internal surface. xni. 74 1422. Cerebral Arteries, in the coats of which earthy matter is deposited. vi. 28 1423. The arteries forming the Circle of Willis, with their primary branches. At various points their walls have been thickened by atheromatous deposits, and, especially along the posterior cerebral, and at the bifurcation of the carotid, these are so considerable as almost to close the canal of the arteries. The brain retained its natural appearance. vi. 76 The patient died from enteric fever.

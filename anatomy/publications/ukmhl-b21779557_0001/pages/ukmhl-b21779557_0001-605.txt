PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. 547 38. An ossifying Sarcoma of the lower extremity of a Femur, having a similar structure to No. 36. The cellular elements are, however, more abundant. From Specimen No. 477. 39. An ossifying Sarcoma of the lower extremity of a Femur; the section (a) taken from the circumference of the bone, consists of spindle cells; that within the bone (b) resembles the tumour described in No. 36. From Specimen No. 481. 40. An ossifying Sarcoma, having essentially the same structure as Specimens Nos. 36 and 38, but intermixed with cartilage in places. From Specimen No. 523. CANCERS. 41. A medullary Cancer of the Frontal Bone. It consists of an alveolar stroma of fibrous tissue, enclosing epithelial-like cells, arranged in places like an epithelial lining around the walls of the alveoli. From Specimen No. 495. 42. A medullary Cancer of the Ribs. From Specimen No. 498. 43. A medullary Cancer of a Humerus. From Specimen No. 500a. 44. A Tumour of the Arm, probably a medullary Cancer. After it had existed ten years, a tumour of the ilium made its appearance. From Specimen No. 505. 45. A medullary Cancer of a Femur, secondary to a cancer of the Breast. From Specimen No. 507. 46. Section of Bone from the interior of a medullary Tumour of a Femur. It is cancellous, but well formed and hard ; its lacunas and their canals are of normal appearance. 47. A medullary Cancer of a Tibia, probably secondary to a Pelvic Tumour. From Specimen No. 508. 48. A scirrhous Cancer of a Humerus, secondary to a mammary Cancer. From Specimen No. 510. 49. A scirrhous Cancer of a Humerus. From Specimen No. 511. 50. A scirrhous Cancer of a Femur. From Specimen No. 512. 51. A Tumour of a lower Jaw, consisting entirely of fibrous tissue, imbedded in which are cylinders and alveoli containing narrow, almost spindle-shaped, small epithelial cells. The tumour is of the same nature as the following specimen. From Specimen No. 535. 52. An Epithelioma,, involving a lower Jaw, the cells of which by undero-oino- colloid metamorphosis have led to the formation of cysts. Be From Specimen No. 536. 2 N 2

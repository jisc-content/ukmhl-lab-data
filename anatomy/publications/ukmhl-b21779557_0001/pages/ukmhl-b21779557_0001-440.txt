From time to time serum and pus were let out from the wouud, always with relief to the cerebral symptoms.

Beneath the adjacent portion of dura mater is a large cavity which was filled with pus. 2528. Several large portions of Cerebrum, which protruded in a case of Hernia Cerebri, and were removed during life. vi. 23 The patient was a boy.. 12 years old. He had fracture with depression about the lambdoid suture. Portions of bone were removed without injury of the dura mater; on the tenth day after the fracture, the hernia of the brain appeared, and in three days was as large as an orange. He died on the third day after the removal of these portions of brain, in which, when first removed, both the cortical and medullary substance presented a natural appearance. The case is described by Mr. Stanley, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. vih, p. 14. London, 1817. 2529. Portions of Cerebrum, which protruded in a case of Hernia Cerebri, and were removed during life. vi. 34 The patient, a boy, 11 years old, had fracture of the frontal bone, several portions of which were removed, without injury to the dura mater. The protrusion began on the seventh day ; it was twice removed, and as often reproduced ; but the portion last protruded sloughed off, and the patient completely recovered. The case is published by Mr. Stanley, with the preceding one. 2530. False Hernia Cerebri. Through an opening in a portion of the skull-cap, granulations, springing from the brain, protrude.

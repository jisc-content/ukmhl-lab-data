549 PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. DISEASES OF ARTERIES. EFFECTS OF LIGATURE. 63. A section of the extremity of a Femoral Artery from a Stump, three weeks after amputation. The clot is firmly adherent to the intima at one point; tor the rest of its circumference, the periphery of the clot is thickly infiltrated with leucocytes. The middle, and deep layer of the inner coats of the artery are also in a corresponding situation thickly infiltrated with leucocytes. The patient died of pyaemia. ATHEROMA AND CALCAREOUS DEGENERATION. 64. Sections of an Atheromatous Aorta, showing fibroid thickening of the intima. 65. Primary Calcareous Degeneration of an Anterior Tibial Artery. The intima is thickened and the muscular coat is calcified throughout the greater part of the circumference of the vessel. DISEASES OF VEINS. PHLEBITIS. 66. Section of a Vein affected with Suppurative Phlebitis. The deep layer of the intima is crowded with leucocytes. A layer of organised blood-clot is attached to the inner surface of the vessel, but the central part of the clot was broken down. From Specimen No. 1578. DISEASES OF THE LARYNX. TUMOURS. 67. Sections of an Epithelioma attached to the right Arytseno-Epiglottidean fold. From Specimen No. 1652. DISEASES OF THE LUNGS AND BRONCHI. BRONCHITIS. 68. Mucous Cells from Bronchial Sputum containing pigment granules. PNEUMONIA. 69. Croupous Pneumonia. TUBERCLE. 70. Miliary Tubercle of the Lung. The alveoli in many places are filled with blood (pulmonary apoplexy). 70a. Miliary Tubercle of a Lung injected with Prussian blue. The vessels do not penetrate the tubercle. 71. A section of lung affected with Caseous Pneumonia. DISEASES OF THE NOSE, MOUTH, AND TONGUE. TUMOURS OP THE NOSE. POLYPI. 72. Sections of a Nasal Polypus composed of mucous connective tissue, imbedded in which are tubules of gland tissue (myxo-adenoma).

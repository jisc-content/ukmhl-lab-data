SERIES LIII. CALCULI AND OTHER CONCRETIONS FORMED IN THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. SALIVARY CALCULI. OF MAN. 243. Two small Calculi from a Parotid Duct. 244. A Calculus from the Duct of the right Parotid Gland of a young gentle- man, who had suffered for about two years with occasional attacks of inflamma- tion'attending difficult cutting of his wisdom tooth. Latterly, swelling of the cheek in the situation of the anterior portion of the parotid gland and Steno's duct had occurred during, and for some hours after meals, and had been at- tended with stiffness of the jaws and considerable pain. At length the calculus spontaneously escaped. It could then be felt that the whole duct was dilated ; and that the surrounding tissues were indurated. The swelling described dis- appeared from this date. Presented by Sir J ames Paget. 245 A very large Calculus removed from a woman's Submaxillary Duct. A portion of it was crushed in the extraction. When entire it measured an inch and a half in length, and a third of an inch in diameter. Its composition is Phosphate of Lime with animal matter, and a trace of Carbonate of Lime. 246. A Salivary Calculus, consisting of Phosphate and Carbonate of Calcium "* and Magnesium, removed from Wharton's Duct. It was taken from a woman, aged 28 years. Eight years before she first noticed a small hard swelling in the floor of the mouth on the left side. See Lucas Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 302. 247.

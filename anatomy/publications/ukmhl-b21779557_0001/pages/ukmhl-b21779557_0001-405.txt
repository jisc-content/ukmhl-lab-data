DISEASES OP THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS AND VESSELS. 347 fold between the epiglottis and the arytsenoid cartilage, just beneath the diseased glands. Presented by George Macilwain, Esq. Vide specimen in Series XVIII, No. 2070. MELANOTIC TUMOURS. 2293. Portion of Mesentery, with its Glands. The latter are variously enlarged, and occupied by a malignant deposit, discoloured by an abundance of pigment, which determines their melanotic character. xvi. 123 2294. Section of a cluster of Iliac Lymphatic Glands. One of them is much enlarged, and all traces of its natural structure is lost by the accumulation of medullary and melanotic substance in its interior. The melanotic substance is in but small quantity, and the medullary substance appears mottled by it with various shades of grey, brown, and black, in lines and dots. The centre of the mass is occupied by a small quantity of yellow substance. The other glands contain medullary matter, uncoloured by melanotic deposit. xxi. 5 From a man, 30 years old, who died with numerous very large melanotic tumours in the liver. No other organs were affected, and the signs of diseased liver had been observed only tbree months.

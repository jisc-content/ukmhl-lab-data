DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE, ITS COVERINGS, AND THE SPERMATIC CORD. 423 2813. Section of a Tumour of rather soft consistence and fibrous appearance. It measured about two inches in length, and one and a half in breadth. The tumour was removed with the testicle from a child, aged 13 months. The mother had noticed a swelling in the groin for six months. The tumour lay partly in the scrotum, and partly in the groin. On dissection, the spermatic cord was found on the posterior surface of the growth, which was immediately above the epididymis, and covered by the infundibuliform fascia. t , Microscopic examination showed that the tumour consisted of mucoid tissue, and ill developed connective tissue containing round and spindle-shaped cells.â€”See Pathological Society's Transactions, vol. xxxi, 1881.

Its inner surface is fascicu- lated, but lined by a distinct smooth polished membrane, which has no con- nection with the tunica vaginalis and epididymis. The opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis, which were adherent throughout, have been partially separated. The testicle is healthy. xxvin. 10 2815. A Hydrocele in the Spermatic Cord. There are two distinct large cysts which do not communicate. One of these is situated above the testicle, and the other behind it. They are both lined by a distinct membrane, which can readily be dissected from the surrounding structures, as was also the case in the preceding specimen. xxvill. 28 HEMATOCELE OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. 2816. A large Cyst in the Spermatic Cord, which contained blood. The cyst is situated just above the testicle, and the tissues round it are thickened, in- durated, and consolidated. Part of the tunica vaginalis has been removed; the opposite surfaces were completely adherent. xxvin. 11

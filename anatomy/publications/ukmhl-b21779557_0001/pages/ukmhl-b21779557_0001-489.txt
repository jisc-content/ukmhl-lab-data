DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 431 prostate, and thence extend, covering the mucous membrane of the bladder, as high as the orifices of the ureters. 2853. A Bladder and Prostate Gland, from a child, 5 years old. The prostate gland is considerably enlarged both in its lateral and middle lobes, lhe natural structure of the gland has entirely disappeared, and its place is occupied by medullary substance, a portion of which is of dark-greyish colour, perhaps from the deposit of melanotic matter. There are also similar dark-grey deposits m the cellular tissue around the prostate and the neck of the bladder. xxix. 1 ( The chfld had been subject for four mouths to irritabaity of the bladder Ten days before death it had retention of urin,. *hich was succeeded by paralysis of the bladde^ The ca e is described by Mr. Stafford, in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxn, p. 218. .London, 1839 Presented by E. A. Stafford, Esq. 2854. The Bladder and Prostate Gland of a child, 4 years old. None of the natural structure of the prostate can be discerned: in its place there is a mass of soft, white, obscurely fibrous, and shreddy, medullary substance, nearly spheroidal in form, and four inches in diameter. This mass projects backwards between the bladder and rectum, raising the pouch of peritoneum between them to the level of the upper part of the bladder: it must have nearly filled the pelvis. Its posterior and lower part is either superficially ulcerated or has been broken. The peritoneum covering its upper part is extremely congested. xxix. 22 CALCULI m THE PROSTATIC DUCTS. 2855.

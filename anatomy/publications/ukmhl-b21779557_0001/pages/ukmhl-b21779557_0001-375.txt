Left Oblique Inguinal Hernia. Portions of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and of the lower border of the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles, are raised from their connections, to show the passage of the hernial sac through the internal inguinal ring. The coverings of the sac are displayed, and its cavity is opened. xvil. 5 Vide Nob. 2126 to 2129, 2132, 2142. THICKENING OF BODY OF SAC. 2082. Oblique Inguinal Hernia. The sac and its coverings are thickened and indurated, and its internal surface is made rough by the deposit of lymph upon it. xvn. 35 Vide No. 2124. THICKENING- OF NECK OF SAC. 2083.

The sac dilates suddenly immediately below the neck, and there is a pouching of its posterior portion which apparently extended upwards behind the neck.

The sac has enlarged within the inguinal canal, and has thence extended through the opening in the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique muscle, so that it presents a bilocular form, part of the sac being lodged within the inguinal canal, part in the labium, and the two parts being in communication by a narrow canal which passes through the external inguinal ring. The aponeurosis of the external oblique is reflected

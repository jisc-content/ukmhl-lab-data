GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 485 3223. A Tumour, which was found loose in the cavity of the abdomen. It con- sists of a very hard and compact laminated substance, like fibro-cartilage, with deposits of earthy matter in its centre. xxxv. 17 It is probable that the tumour was a pedunculated sub-peritoneal fibroid of the uterus, which became separated, as in Specimen No. 321)3. Presented by Thomas Hot, Esq. REPAIR AND REPRODUCTION" OF INJURED AND LOST PARTS. FORMATION AND STRUCTURE OF CICATRICES. 3224. Portion of Skin, exhibiting a greater degree of vascularity in the situation of a recent cicatrix. XI. 14 3225. A similar specimen. XI. 15 3226. A Hand, in which (in consequence of an injury) a part of the thumb was lost, and the integuments of the palm and the fingers were contracted in the process of cicatrisation.

Section of the Gizzard of a Turkey, with part of a needle in its muscular substance. The tissue around the needle is white and indurated. xv. 30 Presented by Mr. Henry Jones, jun. PROCESS AND EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION. COMPLETELY ORGANIZED EFFUSIONS OF LYMPH PRODUCING ADTTU1 SIONS, FALSE MEMBRANES, &c. 3228. Portions of Abdominal Muscles, and of a Colon. The peritoneum lining the muscles is connected with that covering the intestine, by a newly formed membrane of considerable extent, in which many large blood-vessels are dis played by injection. xy^ ^~ I NDURATION AND SCLEROSIS FROM INFLAMMATION. 3229. A Granular Contracted Kidney. The kidney is firm, toua-h and the dis tmction between the cortical and medullary portion is almost lost, owine- to the increase of the interstitial connective tissue of the organ, which is much diminished in size The surface is granular and the capsule adherent. Some small cysts are scattered here and there in the parenchyma and on the surface. 3229a. A section of a Tibia, which is enlarged, heavy, and very irregular on «,„ surface. In the section all trace of the distinction between the compact and cancellous tissue is lost, and the osseous tissue is for the most mrt 7^ dense* and close-textured (sclerosed), but in places finely porous These changes were the result of long-continued chronic inflammation

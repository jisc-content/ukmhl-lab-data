PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. ZD I tissue, enclosing tubules of gland-tissue lined with small round epithelial cells. 140. A similar Specimen. 141. A similar Specimen. From Specimen No. 3157. 142. Section of Fibro-adenoma, the greater part of which is composed of loose, fibrous tissue, containing many nuclei, and, in places, of mucous tissne : en- closed within the matrix are tubules of gland-tissue and large, irregular, and radiating spaces lined with small epithelial cells. From Specimen No. 3158. MYXOMATA, SARCOMATA, ADENO-SARCOMATA. 143. A Tumour of the Breast, consisting for the most part of mucous tissue, containing a few roundish and irregular cyst-spaces : tracts of fibrous tissue intersect the tumour. From Specimen No. 3162. 144. A Tumour of the Mammary Gland, consisting of loose connective and some mucous tissue containing many nuclei, and enclosing irregular cyst-spaces lined by epithelium, into which nodules of the tissue forming the bulk of the tumour, project. Some tubules of gland-tissue are also observable. From Specimen No. 3288a. 145. A Tumour, in general arrangement resembling the preceding; but the matrix is so thickly crowded with nuclei, that it presents the characters of a round-cell sarcoma. From Specimen No. 3161b. 146. A Tumour of the Mammary Gland, which consists of fibrous tissue enclosing- some gland-tissue ; but in places it is largely composed of spindle-cells. From Specimen No. 3163. CANCERS. 147. Section of a scirrhous Cancer of the Mammary Gland. The tumour consists of a dense connective tissue stroma, enclosing alveoli, of various shapes and sizes, filled with cells of the epithelial type, so closely aggregated, that the protoplasm around the deeply-stained nucleus of the cells appears blended. 148. A similar Specimen. 149. A scirrhous Cancer of the Mammary Gland, in which the stroma is abun- dant and the alveoli small. The cells have dropped out from many of the alveoli. From Specimen No. 3166. 150. A similar Specimen, in which the alveoli are larger. From Specimen No. 3167. 151. A scirrhous Cancer of the Mammary Gland. From Specimen No. 3180. 152. A medullary Cancer of the Mammary Gland. From Specimen No. 3184. 153. A medullary Cancer of the Mammary Gland, in which the cells had in places undergone colloid degeneration.

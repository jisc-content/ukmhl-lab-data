INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 131 FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE TRUNK* AND EXTREMITIES. STERNUM. , 898. A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its junc- tion with the third. c- (In Case H.) 899. A Sternum, fractured transversely through its second portion near its junction with the first. c- 46 (In Case H.) BIBS. 900. Two Ribs which have been fractured. In one rib the fracture occurred near its middle, and in the other near its angle. There has been very little displacement of the ends of the bones, and the fractures are firmly and smoothly united. C. 23 (In Case H.) CLAVICLE. 901. A Clavicle, which has been broken near the middle of its shaft. The frac- ture is united with displacement, the scapular end of the bone being beneath its sternal end. C. 32 (In Case H.) 902. A Clavicle, which has been fractured obliquely near the middle of its shaft. The fracture has united, with scarcely any irregularity of the surface of the bone. c. 68 (In Case H.) For other Fractures of the Clavicle, see Nos. 743, 780, 785, 799, 828, 860, and Series IV, No. 1018. SCAPULA. Body. 903. A Scapula, which has been broken vertically through its infra-spinous portion, and apparently through the acromion. Both fractures are united by bone. c. 33 (In Case H.) Vide No. 909. Acromion Process. 904. A Scapula, in which there has been a transverse fracture of the acromion through the middle. The fracture was not united by bone, but probably by fibrous tissue : for, though it may be inferred, from the appearance of the bone, that the fracture occurred a considerable time before death, yet the portions do not seem to have moved on each other. C. 28 (In Case H.) Vide No. 836. Coracoid Process. 905. A Scapula. The extremity of the coracoid process has been separated from the rest of the bone, probably by a fracture. There has been no attempt at bony union, the fragment being kept in position by dense fibrous tissue. 0. 120 From a body brought in for dissection. (In Case H.) 906. Right Scapula, showing a fracture of the extremity of the coracoid process. From the body of a male brought to the rooms for dissection. (Tn Case H.) Vide No. 909. HUMERUS. Anatomical Neck. 907. A Scapula and Humerus, in which there has been a dislocation of the head with a fracture of the anatomical neck, of the humerus. The head of the bone' * For Injuries of the Vertebra?, see p. 166. K 2

DISEASES OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS AND VESSELS. 346 2283. Sections of Mesenteric Glands, enlarged and nearly filled with tubercular matter. The injection displays the vascularity of the small portions of the healthy glandular tissue which remain around the morbid deposit; but none of the injected fluid appears to have entered the tubercular matter. xvi. 62 From the same patient as No. 1878, Series XVI. 2284. Mesenteric Glands, enlarged and infiltrated with caseous material. Adjacent portions of the ileum contain extensive tubercular ulcers. 133a From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. Vide specimens in Series XI, Nos. 1686, 1687, 1714, 1756; and Series XVI, No. 1881. CALCIFICATION OF DISEASED GLANDS. 2285. Bronchial Glands, nearly the whole substance of which is replaced by earthy matter. xiv. 14 2286. An enlarged Mesenteric Gland, laden with calcareous material. 135 From the collection of J. R. Farre, Esq., M.D. Vide No. 3221a, Series L. MORBID GROWTHS. 2287. Section of Inguinal Glands, from a man whose penis was removed on account of epithelial cancer. The glands are filled with opaque-white, soft and friable cancerous matter, which conceals or has superseded their natural struc- ture, xxi. 6 From the patient from whom the specimen of cancerous lungs in Series XI, No. 1729, was taken. 2288. A Trachea, with the Arch of an Aorta, the Pulmonary Artery, and numerous Lymphatic Glands. The glands are enlarged, and the greater part of their natural texture appears to be occupied by a soft medullary substance, of which the natural pale colour is variously shaded by the black deposit in the glands. The diseased glands adhere closely to the trachea, and in some degree compress and project into it; the left recurrent nerve also is adherent to some of the glands, and appears compressed by them. xxi. 1 2289. Sections of Bronchial Glands, which are greatly enlarged, and in which the place of the natural texture is occupied by a soft medullary substance. In one of them there are large cavities in the medullary substance, which were filled with blood. The right bronchus is compressed by the diseased glands. xiv. 15 2290. Bronchial Glands, with the Trachea, Heart, and Large Vessels. Tbe glands are enlarged, and soft medullary matter is extensively formed in them. xiv. 17 From the same child as No. 2499, in Series XXX. 2291. A large mass of Morbid Structure, which occupied the situation of the Mesenteric Glands. It is composed of a cluster of distinct tumours, of a soft, reddish-brown, vascular, and spongy medullary substance. xvi. 5 From the same patient as No. 2219, in Series XXI, and No. 2803, in Series XXXVI. 2292. A Larynx, by the side of which are several Lymphatic Glands greatly enlarged and filled by a morbid substance, which, on the cut surface of one of the glands, hangs in fine shreds, like part of a medullary growth. There is also a small flat growth on the mucous membrane lining the interior of the

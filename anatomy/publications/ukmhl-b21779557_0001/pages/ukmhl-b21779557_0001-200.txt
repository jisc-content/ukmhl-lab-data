INJURIES OF BONES (FRACTURES). 142 Obtained from the dissecting rooms. For other Specimens, see Nos. 795, 841, 842, 843, and 855. TIBIA AND FIBULA. Upper Extremity. 990. The upper extremity of a Tibia, with an oblique fracture just below the head, from which a vertical fracture extends through the articular surface into the knee-joint. The fibula was also fractured in a corresponding position. From a man, aged 39 years, who fell down a flight of stairs when intoxicated. He died of delirium tremens three days after the accident.â€”See Kenton Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 309. Shafts. 991. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured in its middle, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly united, but with displace- ment and overlapping of the fractured ends, so that the tibia at the seat of fracture forms an angle directed backwards, and the fibula an angle directed outwards. Both the bones also are atrophied, and very slender. C. 1 (In Case H.) 992. A Tibia and Fibula, fractured in two places. The bones are firmly united, and osseous tissue seems to have been deposited on portions of the shafts independently of the seats of fracture. In the lower third of the tibia is a considerable cavity, from which fragments of necrosed bone had been removed. C. 124 (In Case H.) 993. A Tibia and Fibula, which were fractured somewhat obliquely near the middle of their shafts. The several portions are firmly united, but with lateral displacement, both the upper fragments being placed on the inner side of the lower ones. The fractured ends are rounded and continuous with the uniting ossifying tissue. C. 110 (In Case H.) 994. A Tibia, which was fractured very obliquely through the middle of its shaft. The fractured portions are firmly united, and so exactly that, on the posterior aspect of the bone, the line of fracture is not discernible. The shaft in the neighbourhood of the injury is thickened, and new bone is deposited on many parts of its surface. c. 109 (In Case H.) 995. A Tibia and Fibula. The tibia has been fractured about one-third from its lower end, and the fibula near its upper end. Both fractures are firmly and smoothly united, but with a slight lateral displacement, the lower fragments converging in the interosseous space. c. 3 (In Case H.) 996. Sections of a Tibia and Fibula, fractured through the middle of their shafts; the fractures are united. There is also lateral union of the two bones, and an abundant deposit of new bone above and below the seat of fracture. c. 91 (In Case H.) 997. Portions of a Tibia and Fibula, the shafts of which were fractured obliquely about three inches above the ankle. The fractures have been firmly united, but with displacement, the lower portion of the tibia having been carried towards the fibula. C 18 (In Case H.)

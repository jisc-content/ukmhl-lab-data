528 URINARY CALCULI. 149. A Calculus. Oxalate of Lime, projecting in nodules and sharp points, and surrounded by the Phosphates. 150. Fragments of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime (apparently) sur- rounded by the mixed Phosphates. From the bladder of a man 40 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Vincent. 151. Portions of a Calculus. Oxalate of Lime surrounded by the mixed Phos- phates. From the bladder of a boy 9 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Skey. 152. Oxalate of Lime Calculus, with, apparently, Phosphates on its surface. 153. Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; coated by crystals of Phosphate of Ammonia and Magnesia. From the bladder of a lad 18 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Abbott. 154. Sections of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; with a crust of the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a boy 6 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Vincent. 155. Sections of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; surrounded by the Phosphates. From the bladder of a boy 7 years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Stanley. 156. Sections of a Calculus. Central portion, Oxalate of Lime with a little Uric Acid; around it, Oxalate of Lime; imperfectly coated by the Phosphates of Ammonia and Magnesia. Lithotomy by W. Hill, Esq. 157. A Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; the Phosphates forming the external layer. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder of a child 7i years old. Lithotomy by Mr. Earle. 158. A Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime; surrounded by the Fusible Calculus. Analysis by Dr. Hue. From the bladder. Lithotomy by Sir Wm. Lawrence. 158a. A Calculus, composed at its centre of Oxalate of Lime and Urate of Am- monia. The thin dark rings contain Oxalate of Lime ; the intermediate mass is formed of Phosphate of Lime and Ammonia, Phosphate of Magnesia, with variable proportions of Carbonate of Lime. CALCULI HAVING THREE LAYERS. OXALATE OF LIME. URIC ACID. URATE OF AMMONIA. 159. Section of a Calculus. Oxalate of Lime internally, with an external stratum of impure Uric Acid; a thin layer of Urate of Ammonia with Oxalate of Lime coating the whole. Extracted by Mr. Earle from the bladder of a female by dilatation of the urethra. OXALATE OF LIME. URIC ACID. OXALATE OF LIME. 160. Sections of a Calculus. Nucleus, Oxalate of Lime ; surrounded by Uric Acid, with veins of Oxalate of Lime ; outer coat, pure Oxalate of Lime.

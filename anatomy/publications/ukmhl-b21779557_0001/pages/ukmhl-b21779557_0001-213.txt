INJURIES OF JOINTS, DISLOCATIONS, ETC. 155 SEPARATION OF SYMPHYSES, &c. 1056. A Pelvis and the lower portion of a Femur, from a boy 14 years old. External violence has produced separation of both the sacro-iliac symphyses and the symphysis pubis. c- 4 (In Case H.) 1057. Section of a Sternum, exhibiting a separation between its first and second bones. The two bones overlap considerably, the first projecting in front of the second. The contiguous periosteal surfaces are firmly united. There is also a deposit of osseous substance upon the anterior surface of the second bone imme- diately below the projecting end of the first. IIL "4 The dislocation occurred five months before death, in an elderly man who fell from a tree. He died with cancer of the oesophagus. The other half of the sternum and the oesophagus are in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England. Presented by Joseph Swan, Esq. 1058. The upper portion of a Sternum. The manubrium is separated from the gladiolus and displaced backwards, the extremity of the latter projecting for- wards. The injury was caused by the fall of a bale of linen from a height of forty feet upon the head and shoulders of a man. He also sustained a fracture of the spine in the upper dorsal region, which caused his death ten days after the accident.â€”See Ahernethy Ward Book, vol. vi, p. 229. V

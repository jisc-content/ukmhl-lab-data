vi PREFACE TO THE PRESENT CATALOGUE. In order to preserve the historical interest of the collection, the old nomenclature has, in many instances, been retained in the descriptions, the modern synonyms being placed in brackets. To render the Catalogue as useful and complete as possible, cross- references have been given in all cases in which specimens show more than one pathological condition, as well as to the Microscopic Pre- parations, Drawings, and Casts taken from any of the specimens. A Series of General Pathology has been formed; and a Table of References to specimens in other parts of the Museum illustrating General Pathology, has been appended to the Table of Contents of the Series of General Pathology at the commencement of the volume. The Series' of Calculi, Microscopic Specimens, Casts, and Drawings have been arranged in accordance with the general plan of the Catalogue. The specimens included in the former Catalogue may be identified by the old numbers, which are placed at the lower right hand corner of the descriptions. This Catalogue has been prepared under the directions of the Museum Committee, to whom the various plans for its formation have been submitted. I have received valuable aid in the revision of many of the Series of Diseases of the Internal Organs, and some special Series of Surgical Pathology, from Members of the Medical and Surgical Staff, especially from Dr. Matthews Duncan and Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh has also rendered able assistance by revising the greater portion of the proof-sheets. January, 1882. FREDERIC S. EVE.

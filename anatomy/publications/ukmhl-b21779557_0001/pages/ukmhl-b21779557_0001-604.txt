546 PATHOLOGICAL MICROSCOPIC SPECIMENS. From Specimen No. 476. 22. A spindle-cell Sarcoma of the lower part of a Femur. From Specimen No. 448. 23. A spindle-cell Sarcoma of the lower half of a Femur, in great part ossified. From Specimen No. 450. 24. A central Tumour of the lower extremity of a Femur, composed for the most part of spindle-cells, but containing in the centre a loose gelatinous connective tissue resembling mucous tissue, (a), is from the peripheral; (6), from the central portion of the tumour. From Specimen No. 451. 25. A central spindle-cell Sarcoma of a Tibia. From Specimen No. 453. 26. A peripheral spindle-cell Sarcoma of a Tibia, for the most part organized into an ill-developed form of connective tissue. From Specimen No. 454. 27. A peripheral Sarcoma of the head of a Tibia, consisting of spindle and round- cells. 28. A spindle-cell Sarcoma of a lower Jaw, containing many myeloid cells. From Specimen No. 460. 29. A similar Specimen. From Specimen No. 461. 30. A central round-cell Sarcoma of a Humerus, containing myeloid cells. From Specimen No. 462. 31. A recurrent spindle-cell Sarcoma of a Humerus, which formed, after the removal of a myeloid sarcoma. From Specimen No. 463. 32. A myeloid Sarcoma of the lower extremity of a Femur, consisting for the most part of round-cells, intermixed with some spindle-cells, and containing abundance of myeloid cells. From Specimen No. 465. 33. A myeloid Sarcoma of the lower extremity of a Femur, having a similar structure to the preceding, but containing much effused blood. From Specimen No. 466. 34. A myeloid Sarcoma within the head of a Tibia, having a similar structure to the preceding. From Specimen No. 468. 35. A similar specimen from the lower extremity of a Tibia. From Specimen No. 472. 36. An ossifying Sarcoma of the Femur, consisting of a reticulum of homogeneous intercellular substance, containing small round-cells in its meshes. The section was taken through the point where the ossific matter was extending into the tumour. From Specimen No. 474. 37. An osseous secondary growth in the Lymphatic Glands, taken from the same patient as the preceding, and presenting an exactly similar minute structure.

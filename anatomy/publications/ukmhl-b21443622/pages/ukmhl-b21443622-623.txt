DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 605 Cut transversely through the corpus callosum and the septum lucidum, and turn forwards the anterior half. In this -way the ventricle of the septum will appear, as in fig. 151. By turning- back the posterior half of the corpus callosum a view is obtained of the fornix. This proceeding requires care, or the fornix will be reflected also, since these two arches of nerve-substance are here so closely connected. -p^^^^^ This is a layer of white matter, extending in the form of an arch from before backwards, beneath the corpus callosum. It is the great longitudinal com- missure, and lies over the velum interpositum (fig. 148, p. 601). Fig. 150, 8 1,1. 2, 2, 3, 3, Corpora striata. Thalami optici.

Viewed from its upper surface, it is triangular, with the base behind, as shown in fig. 150. The broad part or body is con- nected with the corpus callosum. From its anterior narrow part proceed two round white cords, called its anterior crura, one on each side of the mesial line. As they pass forwards, the crura descend through a mass of grey matter, towards the base of the brain, where, making a sudden bend, they form the corpora mammillaria, from which they may be traced backwards and fcetal life, and proceeds from before backwards, pari passu with the corpus callosum and fornix.

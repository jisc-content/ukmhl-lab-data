Often there are only ten ganglia, in consequence of two of them uniting here and there. The first thoracic ganglion is the largest. Each ganglion is connected by two branches with the corresponding inter- costal nerve. The nerves proceeding from the ganglia pass inwards to supply the thoracic and part of the abdominal viscera. The branches which proceed from the four upper ganglia are small and are distributed as follows (see the diagram) :— a. Minute nerves from the first and second ganglia to the deep cardiac 'plexus. b. Minute nerves from the third and fourth ganglia to the posterior pulmonary plexus. The branches arising from the six lower ganglia unite to form three nerves —the great splanchnic, the lesser, and the smallest splanchnic nerves. a. The great splanchnic nerve is generally formed by branches from the fifth or sixth to the tenth ganglion. They descend obliquely along the sides of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrse, and unite into a single nerve, which passes through the corresponding crus of the diaphragm, and joins the semilunar ganglion of the abdo- men, sending also branches to the renal and supra-renal plexuses 6. The lesser splanchnic nerve is commonly formed by branches from the eleventh and twelfth ganglia. It passes through the z 2 * DIAGRAM OF THE THOUACIC PORTIOX OF THK SYMPATHETIC.

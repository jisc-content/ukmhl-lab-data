DISSECTION OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 655 in the most compact part of the temporal bone. The cavities are divided into threeâ€”a middle one, called the vestibule, being a centre in which all communicate; an anterior, named from its resemblance to a snail's shell, the cochlea; and a posterior, con- sisting of three semicircular canals. These cavities are filled with a clear fluid, called the endo-lymph, and contain a membranous expansion (the membranous labyrinth), upon which the filament^s of the auditory nerve are expanded. The vestibule, or central chamber, is an irregular oblong cavity, about one-fifth of an inch in its widest part. It communicates in front with the cochlea, through Fig. 166. Vestibttlb. 1.

Posteriorly, this depression is bounded by a ridge, the crista vestibuli, and in some subjects there is behind this eminence the opening of a small canal, called the aqueductus vestibuli. It leads to the posterior surface of the temporal bone,^ and transmits a small vein. In the roof is an oval depression, the fovea hemi-elliptica, which lodges the utricle.

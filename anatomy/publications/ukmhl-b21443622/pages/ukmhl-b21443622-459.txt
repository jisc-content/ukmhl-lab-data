It ascends beneath the psoas, sends branches to this muscle and the quadratus luraborum; then running near the crest of the ilium, it supplies the iliacns internus, and finally inoscu- lates with the deep circumflexa ilii (fig. 98). b. The lateral sacral, usually two in number, descend in front of the sacral foramina, and inosculate on the coccyx with the middle sacral artery. They give branches to the pyriformis, the bladder, and rectum, and others which enter the anterior sacral foramina for the supply of the cauda equina. c. The gluteal is the largest branch. It passes immediately out of the pelvis through the great ischiatic notch, above the pyri- FiG. 99. B TIETV OF THE DIFFERENT DIRECTrONS WHICH AN ABNORMAL OBDURATOR ARTERY MAY TAKE. {Seen from above.)

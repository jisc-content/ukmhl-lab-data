LIGAMENTS OF THE TAESAL JOINTS. 574 slight lateral movement, only permitted in the extended state, Fig. 135. for the better direction of our steps. In adaptation to this movement the internal malleolus is shorter than the outer; it is not so tightly confined by its ligaments, and its articular surface is part of a cylinder. Open the joint to see that the breadth of the articular surfaces of the bones is greater in front than behind. The object of this is to render the astragalus less liable to be dislocated backwards. Whenever this happens, the astragalus must of necessity become firmly locked between the malleoli. Ligaments ^he astragalus is the CONNECTING THE key-stouc of the arch of Bones of the the foot, and Supports the whole weight of the body. It articulates with the os calcis and the os scaphoides in such a manner as to permit the abduction and adduction of the foot, so useful in the direction of our steps. AsTRAGALo- ^hc astragalus articulates with the os calcis, by cAiCANEAi LiGA- two distiuct surfaces separated by the interosseous groove, of which the anterior is convex, the posterior slightly concave. The interosseous ligament descends vertically in the interosseous canal, and is the principal bond of union between the two bones. The posterior ligament is a short oblique band, which passes from the posterior border of the astragalus to the upper border of the os calcis. The external ligament passes vertically from the astragalus to the os calcis. AsTRAGALo- "^^^ autcrior surface of the astragalus is broadly SCAPHOID LiGA- convex, fitting into the concave surface of the ^^^"^^ scaphoid. Superiorly, the surfaces of the two bones are connected by a broad ligament, astragalo-scaphoid, which blends with the external calcaneo-scaphoid. DIAGRAM OF THE EXTERNAL LATERAL LIGAMENT. 1.

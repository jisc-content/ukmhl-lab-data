The posterior division gives off the ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, and gluteal arteries; the anterior gives off the superior vesical, obturator, inferior vesical, middle hsemorrhoidal, ischiatic and pudic; also the uterine and vaginal in the female. Such is their usual order; but these branches, though constant as to their general distributionj vary as to their origin. The branches of the posterior division are â€” a.

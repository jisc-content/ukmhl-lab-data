364 PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. 4th. Tliey are movers of the trunk in various ways. For example, the right external oblique acting with the left internal oblique will rotate the chest towards the left side, as in mowing, and vice versa. The rectus is chiefly concerned in raising the body from the horizontal position, as anyone may ascertain by placing his hand on the abdomen while rising from the ground. By dividing the rectus transversely near the umbilicus, and raising it from its position, we have a complete view of the manner in which the sheath is formed; we observe, too, that this is absent behind the lower fourth of the muscle. Eamifying in the substance of the muscle is a large artery, called the deep epigastric, a branch of the external iliac; also the continuation of the internal mammary, which de- scends from the subclavian. Neetes of the These nerves are-the continuations of the six lower Abdominal "Wall, intercostal nerves, and of the first lumbar. They have the same general course and distribution. They run forwards under the costal cartilages between the internal oblique and trans- versalis towards the rectus. They furnish branches to the ab- dominal muscles, and each gives ofif its lateral and anterior cu- taneous branches, describecl p. 150. The transversalis muscle must now be reflected Dissection â€¢ with the rectus by incisions similar to those for the reflection of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. The parts must be disturbed as little as possible, so that the bearing of the transversalis fascia in reference to the anatomy of the parts concerned in hernia may be thoroughly examined. DISSECTION OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. Fascia Tbans- This fascia is SO called because it lies in contact vERSALis. with the posterior surface of the transversalis muscle. It is comparatively thin, superiorly, where it is conti- nuous with the fascia on the under surface of the diaphragm.

TO THE PEEFACE FOUETH EDITION. In this edition the Editors have most carefully revised the entire work. The order of dissection has been here and there altered; and further illustrations and additional matter intro- duced, especially concerning the Anatomy of the Nervous System and the Senses. The object throughout has been to be as concise as possible, and to put the subject in as clear and practical a light as is compatible with the faithful handling of its natural dij9S- culties. It is hoped that the work, in its present form, is adapted, not only for students, but for members of the profession who wish to refresh their anatomical knowledge. Our best thanks are due to the Demonstrators of Anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital for valuable suggestions. 65 GowER Street : October 1879.

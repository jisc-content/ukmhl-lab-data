353 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Aebiteabt Division into Regions. These lines form Fig, 68. The abdomen is divided into arbitrary regions, that the situation of the viscera contained in it may be more easily described., For this purpose we draw the following lines :â€”one horizontally across the abdomen on a level with the cartilages of the ninth ribs; another on a level with the anterior superior spines of the ilia, the boundaries of three spaces, each of which is subdivided into three regions by a vertical line drawn on each side from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament. Thus, there are a central and two lateral regions in each space. The central region of the upper space is termed the epigastric ; the central one of the middle space is called the umbilical region ; and the central of the inferior space, the hypogastric region. The lateral regions of the spaces from above downwards are termed the right and left hypo- chondriac, the right and left lumbar, and the right and left inguinal or iliac regions, respectively. The abdomen should be distendeXi with air, by means of a blowpipe inserted into the abdominal cavity at the umbilicus. Dissection '^''^ incision should be made from the sternum to the pubes, another from the anterior spine of the A A

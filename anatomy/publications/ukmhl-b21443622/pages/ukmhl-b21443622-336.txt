This origin, which corresponds to the insertion of the trapezius, is tendinous and fleshy everywhere, except at the commencement of the spine of the scapula, where it is simply tendinous, and connected with the infra-spinous aponeurosis. The muscular fibres descend, the an- terior backwards, the posterior forwards, the middle perpendicu- larly ; all converge to a tendon which is inserted into a rough

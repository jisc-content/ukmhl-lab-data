INFEA-CLAVICULAE EEGION. 258 The pectoralis major is supplied with nerves by the anterior thoracic branches of the brachial plexus; with blood, by the long and sliort thoracic branches of the axillary artery. Dissection. Reflect the clavicular part of the pectoralis Anatomy of the major, and in doing so, notice a small nerve, the iNFRA-cLAvictJLAR extemal anterior thoracic, which enters the under surface of this part of the muscle. Beneath the portion thus reflected, part of the pectoralis minor will be exposed. In this triangle, bounded, above, by the clavicle, below, by the upper border of the sternal origin of the pectoralis major, and, on the outer side, by the deltoid, is an important space in which the relative position of the following objects must be carefully ex- amined :— CosTo-coRAcoiD «. A stroug Hgamcntous expansion, called the Membrane. costo-coracoid membrane extends from the car- tilage of the first rib to the coracoid process. Between these points it is attached to the clavicle, and forms a complete invest- ment for the subclavius muscle. Its crescent-shaped edge arches over, and protects the axillary vessels and nerves; from this edge is prolonged a funnel-shaped fascia, which covers the axillary vessels, forming the anterior ^portion of their sheath; the pos- terior being formed by a prolongation of the deep cervical fascia. The front portion of this sheath is perforated by the cephalic vein, the thoracica acromialis artery, and the anterior thoracic nerves. This fascia must be removed. b. Ihe subclavius muscle enclosed in its fibrous sheath. c. The axillary vein, artery, and brachial plexus of nerves. d. A short arterial trunk, the thoracic axis, which divides into several radiating branches. e. The termination of the cephalic vein in the axillary. /. Two nerves, the anterior thoracic, which descend from the brachial plexus below the clavicle, and cross in front of the axillary vessels to supply the pectoral muscles. This muscle lies between the clavicle and the SUBCLATIUS. g^^^ ^.^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^ g^g^ j..^ ^ gj^^j.^ round tendon at the junction of the bone and cartilage, and is

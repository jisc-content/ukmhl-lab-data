665 DISSECTION OF THE SCROTUM AND TESTIS. STRircTtiRE OF The scrotuDi is a pouch of skin for the lodgment THE ScEOTUM. of thc testes, and presents in the middle line a ridge, the raphe, on each side of which it is corrugated into rugse. It is composed of six tunics:â€”1. The skin ; 2. The tunica dartos; 3. A layer of connective tissue ; 4. The spermatic fascia; 5. The cremaster or suspensory muscle ; 6. The infundibuliform fascia, derived from the fascia transversalis. Each of these coverings cannot be demonstrated under ordi- nary circumstances, because they are so blended together; but they can be shown when hjrpertrophied in the case of old and large herniae. ^^^^^ The dartos is a thin layer, consisting of mus- cular fibres of the involuntary kind, like those of the bladder and intestines. It serves to corrugate the loose and extensible skin of the scrotum, and in a measure to support and brace the testicles. It is more abundant in the anterior than the posterior part of the scrotum. Later of Con- Beneath the dartos is a large quantity of loose NECTiTE Tissue. connective tissue, remarkable for the total absence of fat. Together with the dartos, it forms a vertical partition between the testicles, termed the septum scroti. It is not a com- plete partition, since air or fluid will pass from one side to the other. The great abundance and looseness of this tissue explains the enormous swelling of the scrotum in cases of anasarca, and in cases where the urine is effused into it in consequence of rupture or ulceration of the urethra. The spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle, and the infundibuli- form fascia have been described (pp. 359, 361, 366).

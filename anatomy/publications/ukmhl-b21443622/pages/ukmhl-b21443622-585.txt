567 LIGAMENTS OP THE HIP-JOINT. Cotyloid Ugameut, serves as a strap to prevent the femur being extended beyond a certain point, and limits rotation inwards and outwards. Open the capsule to as- Fio.

LiGAMBimTM The Hga- Tebes. mentum teres is exposed by drawing the head of the femur out of the socket. This ligament is somewhat flat and triangular. Its base, which is bifid, is attached, be- ^ low, to the borders of the notch in the acetabulum; its apex, to the fossa in the head of the femur. To prevent pres- sure on it, and to allow free room for its play, there is a gap at the bottom of the acetabulum. This gap is not crusted with cartilage like the rest of the socket, but is occupied by soft fat. The ligamentum teres is surrounded by the synovial mem- brane. An artery runs up with it to the head of the femur. It is a branch of the obturator, and enters the acetabulum through the notch at the lower pait. The chief use of the ligamentum teres is to assist in steadying the pelvis on the thigh in the erect position. In this position, the ligament is vertical, and quite tight (fig. 131): it therefore prevents the pelvis from rolling towards the opposite side, or the thigh from being adducted beyond a certain point. Another purpose served by this ligament is to limit rotation of the thigh, both inwards and outwards. VBRTICAL SECTION THROUGH THE HIP.

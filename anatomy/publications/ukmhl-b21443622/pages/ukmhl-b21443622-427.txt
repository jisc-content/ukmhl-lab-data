The ilio-hypogastric passes forwards . to the crest of the ilium, where it pierces the transversalis, and divides into its two terminal branches—the iliac branch, which supplies the skin over the giutseal region, behind the last dorsal nerve, and the hypogastric branch, which runs forward between the transversalis and internal oblique, and then perforates the aponeu- ]?iG. 86. a. nio-hypogastric n. b.

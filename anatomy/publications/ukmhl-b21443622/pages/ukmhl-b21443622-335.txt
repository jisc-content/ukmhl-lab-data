MUSCLES OP THE SHOULDEE. 317 those of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. All the fibres pass backwards, and converge to be inserted along the inner side of the posterior border of the scapula, chiefly near the upper and lower angles.. This is the most important of the muscles which regulate the movements of the scapula. It draws the scapula forwards, and thus gives additional reach to the arm; it counteracts all forces which tend to push the scapula backwards ; for instance, when a man falls forwards upon his hands, the serratus magnus sustains the shock, and prevents the scapula from being driven back to the spine. Supposing the fixed point to be at the scapula, some anatomists ascribe to it the power of raising the ribs ; hence Sir Charles Bell called it the external respiratory muscle, the in- ternal respiratory muscle being the diaphragm. The nerve which supplies it is a branch of the fifth and sixth cervical nerve : it descends along its outer surface, distributing a filament to each digitation of the muscle (p. 271). _ Divide the serratus magnus near the scapula. Dissection it ^ and remove the arm by sawing through the middle of the clavicle, cutting through the axillary vessels and nerves. These should be tied to the coracoid process. After the removal of the arm, examine the precise insertions of the preceding muscles. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. Dissection. Dissect first the cutaneous nerves of the CuTAifEous shoulder; these are derived, partly from the Nerves OF THE acromial branches of the cervical plexus which Shoulder. descend over the acromion (fig. 59), partly from the circumflex nerve, of which one or two branches turn round the posterior border of the deltoid ; others perforate the muscle, each accompanied by a small artery. Notice the strong layer of fascia upon the surface of the deltoid, which extends from the aponeurosis covering the muscles

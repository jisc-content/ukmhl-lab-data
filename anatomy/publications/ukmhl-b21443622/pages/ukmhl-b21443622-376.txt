ABDOMINAL MU8CLE8. 858 commonly Poujpart's ligament* transmits the great vessels of the thigh, with muscles and nerves. This ligament, when not separated from its fascial connections, does not run straight from the spine of the ilium to that of the pubes, but is slightly curved, with its convexity towards the thigh. Above, and somewhat to the outer side of the spine of the pubes, is situated an opening in the aponeurosis, called Fio. 70. 1. External abdominal ring. 2. Grimbernat's ligament. 3.

In the male it is a triangular opening about an inch long, with its base at the pubes, and will admit the passage of a finger; it transmits the spermatic cord. In the female it is smaller and transmits the round ligament of the uterus. It is bounded by the free margins of the aponeurosis * This was first described by Fallopius, an Italian anatomist, in his 'Observa- tiones Anatomicse,' published in 1661. It was subsequently described by Poupart in 1705, in the 'M6m. de I'Acad. de Paris,' and is now commonly called 'Poupart's ligament.'

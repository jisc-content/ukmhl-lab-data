The remaining bones of the tarsus are connected and main- tained in position by dorsal and plantar ligaments, and strong interosseous bands which pass between their contiguous surfaces. Fia. 137.

This line is interrupted at the joint of the middle cuneiform bone and the second metatarsal bone. Here there is a deep recess, so that the base of this metatarsal bone is wedged in between the internal and external cuneiform bones.

ARTERIAL INOSCULATIONS. 522 The second, the largest, passes thi-ough the tendons of the adductor bi-evis and magnus, and usually furnishes the nutrient artery of the femui-. The third, passes through the tendon of the adductor magnus. The fourth, or terminal branch, passes through the tendon of the adductor magnus, and supplies the hamstring muscles, and inosculates with the perforating and articular arteries. They not only supply the hamstring muscles —namely. Fig. 121. 1. Crural arch. 2. Internal iliac. 3. Superficial femoral. 4. Profunda. 5. lutemal circumflex. 6. External circumflex. 7.

PLAN OF THE INOSCULATIONS OF THE CIRCUMFLEX ABTEEIBS. the biceps, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus—but, the vastus ex- ternus and even the gluteus maximus. The perforating arteries inoscu- late with one another, with the internal and external circumflex, and with the ischiatic arteries. AnTERiAL In- osculations. If the common femoral were tied above the origin of the profunda, how would the circulation

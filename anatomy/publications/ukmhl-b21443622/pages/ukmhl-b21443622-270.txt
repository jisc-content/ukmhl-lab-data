252 ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. The bead of the first rib articulates with a single vertebra. The eleventh and twelfth ribs articulate each with a single vertebra, and are not connected to the transverse processes. The cartilages of all the true ribs are received into slight concavities on the side of the sternum, and are secured by anterior, posterior, upper and lower ligaments. There is a synovial membrane between the cartilage of each rib and the sternum, except that of the first, and usually at each articulation the synovial membrane is separated into two by an inter-articular ligament.

Anterior costo-cen- tral or stellate ligaments. costo-vebtebrat, ligaments. The costal cartilages from the sixth to the tenth are connected by ligamentous fibres. Articulation condyle of the lower jaw articulates with OF THE Lower the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone. The Jaw. joint is provided with an inter-articular fibro- cartilage, with external and internal lateral ligaments, and two synovial membranes (fig. 51). The external lateral ligament extends from the zygoma and its tubercle; its fibres pass downwards and backwards to the tubercle of the condyle of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament extends from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the border of the dental foramen. This so-called ligament cannot in any way contribute to the strength of

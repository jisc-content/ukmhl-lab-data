195 DISSECTION OP .THE LARYNX. vocal cords, the posterior third by the arytenoid cartilages. Above the true vocal cords are situated the superior or false vocal cords. On each side of the larynx, between the true and false vocal cords, is a small recess, the ventHcle of the larynx, leading into a pouch called the sacculus lao^ngis, which ascends for a short distance and terminates in a cul-de-sac by the side of the thyroid cartilage. In the middle line below the base of the epiglottis is seen a round elevation covered with mucous membrane of a bright red colour: this is termed the cushion of the epiglottis. The length of the rima glottidis in the male is eleven lines; its width at rest from three to four lines; in the female its length is eight lines, its width two lines. SupEBioB OR These are the prominent crescentic folds which False VocAi, form the upper boundaries of the ventricles. They are called the false vocal cords because they have little or nothing to do with the production of the voice. They are composed of elastic tissue, like the true vocal cords; but they also contain fatty tissue, which the true ones do not.

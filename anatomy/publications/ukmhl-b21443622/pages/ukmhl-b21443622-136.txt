118 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Before the several organs contained in the thorax are examined, the student should have some knowledge of its framework. The true ribs with their cartilages describe a series of arcs increasing in length from above downwards, and form, with the dorsal ver- tebrae behind, and the sternum in front, a barrel of a conical shape, broader in the lateral than in the antero-posterior diameter. The base is closed in the recent state by a muscle, the diaphragm, which forms a muscular partition between the chest and the abdomen. This partition is arched upwards, so that it constitutes a vaulted floor for the chest, and by its capability of alternately falling and rising, it increases and diminishes the capacity of the thorax. The spaces between the ribs are occupied by the intercostal muscles. In each intercostal space there are two layers of these muscles arranged like the letter X. The fibres of the outer layer run obliquely from above downwards and forwards; those of the inner layer in the reverse direction. Such, in outline, is the framework of the thorax, which con- tains the heart with its large vessels and the lungs. Its walls are composed of different structuresâ€”bone, cartilage, muscles and ligaments, which fulfil two important conditions: 1st, by their solidity and elasticity they protect the important organs contained in the thorax ; 2ndly, by their alternate expansion and contraction they act as mechanical powers of respiration. For they can in- crease the capacity of the chest in three directions : in height, by the descent of the diaphragm; in width, by the rotation of the ribs; and in depth, by the elevation of the sternum.

FACIAL NERVE IN THE TEMPOEAL BONE. 226 outside of the head through the fissure between the mastoid process and the meatus auditorius externus. It is distributed to the skin of the auricle and communicates with the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. Facial Nerve '^^^ facial nerve is contained within the meatus IN THE auditorius internus, together with the auditory Temporal BoNB. nerve. At the bottom of the meatus the two nerves are connected by one or more filaments. The facial nerve then enters the aquaductus Fallopii. This is a tortuous canal in the substance of the temporal bone, and terminates at the Fig. 46. 1. The chMrda tjmpani. 2. The geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. 3. The great petrosal nerve., 4.

The nerve proceeds from the meatus in- ternus for a short distance outwards, where it presents a ganglionic enlargement; it then makes a sudden bend backwards along the inner wall of the tympanum above the fenestra ovalis, and lastly, curving downwards along the back of the tympanum, it leaves the skull through the stylo-mastoid foramen. Its branches in the temporal bone are :â€” a. Communicating filaments with the auditory nerve, in the meatus auditorius internus. h. The great petrosal nerve, which runs to the spheno-palatine gang- lion. (Fig. 46. 3.)

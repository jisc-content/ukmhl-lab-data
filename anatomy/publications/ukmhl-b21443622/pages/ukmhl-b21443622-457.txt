It traverses the two layers of the triangular ligament, and is about an inch below the symphysis pubis, and nearly the same distance from the rectum; it is not, however, equidistant from this portion of the intestine at all points, because of the downward bend which the rectum makes towards the anus.* The membranous part of the urethra in children is very Long, owing to the smallness of the prostate at that period of life ; it is also Gomposed of thin and delicate walls, and lies close to the rectum. In sounding a child, therefore, it is very necessaiy not to use violence, else the instrument is likely to pass through the coats of the urethra and make a false passage. This muscle supports the anus and lower part of the rectum like a sling; and, with the coccy- geus and compressor urethrse, forms a muscular floor for the cavity of the pelvis. To see the muscle, the pelvic fascia must be reflected from its upper surface. It arises from the posterior aspect of the pubes near the symphysis, from the spine of the ischium, and, between these bones, from the^ tendinous line which marks the division of the pelvic fascia into the obturator and recto-vesical layers (p. 430). From this long origin the fibres descend inwards, and are inserted thusâ€”the anterior, passing under the prostate, meet their fellow in the middle line of the perineum in front of the anus (forming the ' so-called' levator prostatge); the middle are inserted into the side of the rectum, while the posterior meet their fellow beneath the rectum. The levator ani is supplied by the inferior haemorrhoidal, the two lower sacral, and the coccygeal nerves. The action of the levatores ani is to retract the anus and the rectum after it has been protruded in defsecation by the combined action of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm. This muscle should be regarded as a continu- ation of the levator ani. It arises by its apex from the spine of the ischium, gradually spreads out, and is in- * If a clean vertical section were made, we should see that the two canals form the sides of a triangular space, of which the apex is towards the prostate. This is Bometimes called the recto-\irethral triangle.

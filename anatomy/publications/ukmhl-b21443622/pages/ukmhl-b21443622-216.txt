DISSECTION OP THE LARYNX. 198 and the weight. This muscle dilates the glottis at each inspira- tion. Its nerve conies from the inferior laryngeal. M. Artte- This single muscle is situated immediately at NoiDEus. the back of the arytenoid cartilages. The fibres pass across from one cartilage to the other running in a transverse direction. Action.—By approximating the arytenoid cartilages, they assist in contracting the glottis. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. M. Artteno- This muscle arises from the outer angle of the EPiGLOTTiDEus. arytcuoid cartilage and, crossing its fellow like Fig. 37. the letter X, is inserted, partly into the apex of the opposite arytenoid,cartilage, and partly into the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. M. Cbico- To expose this muscle, cut away the ala of the AKTrENOIDBUS thyroid cartilage. It ao^ises from the upper Lateralis. border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and is inserted into the external angle of the base of the arytenoid in front,of the crico-arytenoideus posticus. Action—By drawing the arytenoid cartilages inwards, the muscles of opposite sides contract the glottis (fig. 38). Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal.

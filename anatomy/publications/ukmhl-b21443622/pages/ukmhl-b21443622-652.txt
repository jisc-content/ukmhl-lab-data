With a little care it will be easy to remove the outer coat of the eye without injiu-ing the dark choroid coat, the ciliary muscle, or the iris. In the loose brown-coloured connective tissue between the sclerotic and the choroid are the ciliary nerves passing forwards to the iris; their white colour makes them very con- spicuous on the dark ground.

The curve of the cornea forms part of a smaller circle than that of the sclerotic, so that it projects further forwards, varying in this respect in different eyes, and at different ages of life. It is firmly connected at its margin to the sclerotic, with the fibres of which it is continuous. The margin of the sclerotic is bevelled on the inside ; that of the cornea on the outside, so that the former overlaps the latter (fig. 161). I

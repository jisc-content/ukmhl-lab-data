060 ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. serted, in common with the tendon of the transversalis muscle into the pubes and for a short distance into the linea ilio-pectinea, immediately behind the external ring. The aponeurosis of the internal oblique is the broad expanded tendinous tissue into which the muscle is anteriorly attached. It extends from the chest to the pelvis, and its fibres run in the same direction as the muscle. At the outer border of the rectus it splits into two layers : an anterior, which passes in front of the rectus in conjunction with the aponeurosis of the external oblique; and Fig. 71. 2.

DIAQEAM OF THE LOWER FIBRES OF THE INTERNAL OBLIQUE AND TRANSVERSALIS, WITH THE CREMASTER MUSCLE. a posterior, which, in common with the aponeurosis of the transversalis, passes behind the rectus. The two layers thus form a sheath for the rectus, which, except at the lower fourth behind, is complete. Midway between the umbilicus and the pubes, the aponeuroses of all the three muscles pass in front of the rectus, so that posteriorly in this situation it has no sheath. The lower free border of the posterior part of the sheath* marks the situation where the deep epigastric artery enters the substance of the rectus. * Sometimes called the ' semilunar fold of Douglas.'

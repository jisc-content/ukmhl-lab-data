ELBOW JOINT. 344 humerus. The joint is secured by two strong lateral ligaments. No ligament is attached to the head of the radius, otherwise its rotatory movement would be impeded. The head is simply sur- rounded by a ligamentous collar, called the annular ligament, within which it freely rolls in pronation and supination of the hand. Internal lateral ligament.— This is triangular, and is divided into two portions, an anterior and a posterior. Its anterior part is attached to the front of the internal condyle of the humerus : Fio. 66. a. External lateral liga- ment. 6. Orbicular or anmilar ligament. LIGAMENTS OF THE ELBOW JOINT. from this point the fibres radiate, and are inserted along the inner margin of the coronoid process of the ulna. The posterior part is also triangular, and passes from the back part of the internal con- dyle to the inner border of the olecranon. A band of fibres extends transversely from the olecranon to the coronoid process, across a notch observable on the inner side of the sigmoid cavity : through this notch small vessels pass into the joint.. External lateral ligament.—This is attached to the external condyle of the humerus, and is in intimate connection with the

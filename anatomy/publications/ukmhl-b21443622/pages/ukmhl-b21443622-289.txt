Its action is to draw the scapula forwards; but of this more hereafter. It is sup- plied by the following nerve, which is seen on its outer surface. ^ This nerve supplies the serratus magnus only.

The filaments of the intercosto-humeral nerves (p. 262) descend along the inner and posterior part of the arm as far as the olecranon. The branches of the internal cutaneous nerve perforate the fascia about the middle of the arm, and divide into an anterior and a posterior branch; the anterior passes down in front of the arm (as a rule beneath the median basilic vehi), and supplies the skin as far as the wrist; the * It may be asked why this nerve is called the external respiratory. It -was so named by Sir C. Bell, â– who considered the serratus magnus as the external respiratory muscle, co-operating -with the diaphragm or internal respiratory mxiscle.

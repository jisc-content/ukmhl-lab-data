601 DISSECTION OP THE BEAIN. fresh Lrain, two longitudinal white tracts, named the nerves of Lancisi, run parallel to it; and external to these ag'ain are two • other longitudinal fibres, strice longitudinales laterales. The surface of the corpus callosuni is marked by transverse lines which indicate the course of its fibres; these are the linece transversce of the old anatomists. The anterior cerebral arteries proceed along the surface of the corpus callosum to the back of the brain. Fig. 148. Forameu of Monro Middle commissui-e . Anterior commissure. Lamina cinerea . .

The anterior part of the corpus callosum turns downwards and backwards, forming a bend called its genu. The inferior part of this bend—ros^mm—becomes gradually thinner and narrower, and terminates in two peduncles, which diverge from each other, and are lost, one in each fissure of Sylvius. Between these crura is placed the lamina cinerea (fig. 147). The posterior part of the corpus callcsum terminates in a thick, round border which is free, and beneath it the pia mater enters the interior of

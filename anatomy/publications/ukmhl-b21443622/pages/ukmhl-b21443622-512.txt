In a colon moderately distended and dried, we observe that the mucous membrane forms numerous ridges or incomplete septa (see fig. 113): they correspond to the grooves on the external surface of the bowel, and disappear, like the sacculi, when the longitudinal bands are divided. The rectum differs from the rest of the large intestine in that its longitudinal muscular fibres are not collected into bands, but Fig. 113. 1. Ileum. 2. Ctecum or caput coli. 3.

Moreover, both the longitudinal and circular fibres are of considerable strength, like those of the oesophagus, as one might expect from the parti- cular functions which these parts of the alimentary canal have to perform. For an inch and a half, or thereabouts, above the anus, the circular fibres are remarkably developed, and constitute the internal sphincter ani. The mucous membrane of the large intestine differs consider- ably from that of the small. There are neither valvulae conni-

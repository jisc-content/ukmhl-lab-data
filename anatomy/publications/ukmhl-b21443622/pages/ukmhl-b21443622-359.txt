The conoid ligament is fixed at its apex to the root of the coracoid process, ascends nearly vertically, and is attached by its base to the clavicle. When the clavicle is fractured in the line of the attachment of the coraco-clavicular ligament, there is little or no displacement of the fractured ends, these being kept in place by the ligament. LiGAiEBNTs OF These are two: the transverse ligament, at- THE Scapula. tached to the margins of the supra-scapular notch; and the coraco-acromial or triangular ligament, attached by its Fig. 65. 5.

It is separated from the upper part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint by a large bursa. Shoulder- The articular surface of the head of the humerus, JOINT. forming rather more than one-third of a sphere,' moves upon the shallow glenoid cavity of the scapula, which is of an oval form, with the broader end downwards, and the long diameter nearly vertical. The security of the joint depends, not upon any mechanical contrivance of the bones, but upon the great strength and number of the tendons which surround and are in timately connected with it.

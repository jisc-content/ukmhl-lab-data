26 NERVUS ACCESSORICrg. and, passing obliquely downwards from beneath the sterno-mastoid IS the spinal accessory nerve, which enters the under part of the trapezius. The transversalis colli (posterior scapular) artery and vein, and "its branch the superficialis colli (which chiefly supplies the trapezius), cross transversely outwards the lower part of the space. A chain of lymphatic glands is also found along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. Nehtus The upper part of the sterno-mastoid is traversed Accessorius. obliquely by a large nerve called the spinal acces- sory or n. accessorius. This nerve, one of the three composing the eighth pair of cerebral nerves, arises from the side of the medulla oblongata below the pneumogastric nerve, and from the cervical portion of the spinal cord by a series of filaments from the lateral tract as low down as the sixth cervical vertebra. It ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, through the foramen magnum into the skull.

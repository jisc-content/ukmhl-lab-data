692 BISSEOTION OF THE BRAIN. of Sylvius. It consists of a number of hidden convolutions ((/2/ri operii) connected■ with those adjoining it, and corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum. The frontal lobe is on its external surface divided by two frontal fissures into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal'convolution (fig. 143). The only fissure of the parietal lobe is the inter-parietal sulcus, which separates the upper from the lower parietal convolution, which, latter is occasionally divided into the supra-marginal and angular gyrus ; the one being above, the other behind.the fissure of Fig. 144.

Behind the fissure of Kolando is the asoending parietal convolution, which is- usually continuous with the ascending frontal convolution, above and below the fissure. The occipital lobe is composed of a superior, middle, and in- ferior occipital convolution, separated by ill-defined sulci, and connected with some parietal and temporo-sphenoidal convolutions

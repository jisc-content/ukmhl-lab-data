STRTJCTUBE OF THE KIDNEY. 484 Fig. 110. capsule does not penetrate into the interior of the kidney, and can be readily stripped off when healthy, leaving the surface perfectly smooth. A longitudinal section should be made through the kidney to ex- amine its interior. This section displays two distinct substances, an outer or cortical, and an inner or medullary. The medullary structure is col- lected into from ten to sixteen pyramidal bundles (pyramids of Malpighi,* fig. 110); the apices of these, termed paplllw, project into one of the terminal divisions of the excretory tube. The pyra- mids are surrounded by the cor- tical substance which dips down between them ; they are composed of minute straight tubes, which proceed from the cortical portion to end on the papillaB.f The cortical structure is deeper in colour than the medullary, forms the outer part of the kidney, and dips down between the pyramids. It consists of convoluted tubes, which become dilated at their extremities into what are called the Malpighian capsules. At the hilus is the dilated commencement of the ureter, called the pelvis of the Icidney. It is funnel-shaped, and its broad part divides into two principal channels, which again branch and form * So named after Malpighi, a celebrated Italian anatomist wlio lived during the middle and latter part of the seventeenth century. f Each pyramid represents what was, in the early stage of the kidney's growth, a distinct and independent lobe. In the human subject the lobes gradually coalesce, and no trace of their primordial state remains, except the pyramidal arrangement of the tubes. But in the kidneys of the lower mammalia, of birds and reptiles, the lobes are permanently separate. SECTION OF THE KIDNEY. 1. Ureter. 2. Pelvis of the kidney. 3. 3, 3. PapUlEe.

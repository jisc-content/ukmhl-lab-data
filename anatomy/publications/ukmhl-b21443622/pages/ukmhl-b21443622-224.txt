206 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. some of their fibres ascend directly to the surface; others cross in the raiddle line, intersect the longitudinal fibres and finally ter- minate upon the sides of the tongue. Lastly, the fibres of the stylo-glossi should be traced along the side of the tongue to the apex. FiBEous Septum The fibrous septum of the tongue is a vertical OF THE Tongue. plane of fibrous tissue which extends, in the mesial line, from the base to the apex. It is connected behind with the hyoid bone, and lost in front between the muscles. In it is some- times found a piece of fibro-cartilage, called nucleus fibrosus Ungues, a representative of the lingual bone in some of the lower animals. The aHeries supplying the tongue are the dorsal and ranine branches of the lingual artery (p. 52). The nerves to the tongue should now be followed to their termination. The hypoglossal supplies with motor power all the muscles. The gustatory or lingual branch of the inferior division of the fifth is distributed to the raucous membrane and papillae of the apex and sides of the tongue, supplying the anterior two- thirds with common sensation. Upon this nerve depends the sensation of all ordinary impressions, such as that of hardness, softness, heat, cold, and the like. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve supplies the mucous membrane at the back and the sides of the tongue, and the papillae circum- vallatse. Under the microscope small ganglia may be distinguished on the terminal fibres of this nerve. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. To expose the contents of the orbit, remove that portion of the orbital plate which forms the roof of the orbit as far back as the optic foramen, making one section on the outer side, the other on the inner side of the roof. In doing this, be careful not to injure the little pulley on the inner side for the superior oblique. The anterior fourth of the roof should be turned forwards and downwards.

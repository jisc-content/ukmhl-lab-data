THE DELTOID. 319 surface on the outer side of the humerus, a little above the middle of the shaft. The insertion of the tendon extends one inch and a halfalono- the humerus, and terminates in a V-shaped form, the origin of the brachialis anticus embracing it on either side. Sometimes a few fibres of the pectoralis major are connected with its front border. The muscular bundles composing the deltoid have a peculiar arrangement: a peculiarity arising from its broad origin and its narrow insertion. It consists in the interposition of tendons between the bundles for the attachment of the muscular fibres. The annexed woodcut shows this arrangement better than any description. The action of the muscle is not only concentrated upon one point, but its power is also greatly increased by this arrangement.

The elevation of the arm beyond this angle is effected through the raising of the shoulder by the trapezius and ser- ratus magnus. Its anterior fibres draw the arm forwards; its pos- terior, backwards. This powerful muscle is supplied with blood, by the anterior and posterior circumflex, the thoracica humeraria, the thoracica acromi- alis, all from the axillary artery; also by the deltoid branch of the brachial. Its nerve is the circumflex. The rotundity of the shoulder is due not so much to the deltoid as to the upper end of the humerus. When the head of the humerus is dislocated into the axilla, the fibres of the muscle run vertically to their insertion; hence the flatten- ing of the deltoid, and the greater prominence of the acromion.

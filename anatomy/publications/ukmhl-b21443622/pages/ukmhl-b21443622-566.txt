HAMSTRING MUSCLES. 548 leg: the bones of the lower extremity represent a pillar which supports the weight of the trunk on a ball-and-socket joint; the weight is nicely balanced on all sides, and prevented from falling by four groups of muscles. In front, are the rectus and sartorius ; on the inner side, the adductors; on the outer side, the gluteus medius and minimus; behind, the hamstrings and gluteus maximus. The semimembranosus can also rotate the knee inwards, thus assisting the popliteus. The hamstring muscles are su^jplied with blood by the perfo- rating branches of the profunda, which come through the tendon of the adductor magnus close to the femur. Their nerves are derived from the great ischiatic. IscHiATic This nerve descends from the gluteal region Nbrye. upon the adductor magnus, and, after being crossed by the long head of the biceps, runs along the outer border of the semimembranosus down the popliteal space. The further course of this nerve has already been described (p. 542). Deferring the course, relations, and branches of the popliteal artery till this vessel is exposed throughout its whole com*se, pass on now to the dissection of the calf. * Continue the incision down the centre of the calf to the heel, and reflect the skin. Short or "^^^ large vein seen in the middle of the back PosTERioE Sa.- of the leg is called the shoo^t or posteHor saphena. PHENA Vein. It commences on the outer side of the foot, ascends behind the outer ankle, where it has a communication with the deep veins, and then runs up the calf between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius, receiving numerous veins in its course. It eventually passes through the muscular fascia,' and joins the popliteal vein. The chief cutaneous nerve of the calf is the short or posterior saphenous nerve ; some branches, however, from the long saphenous and lesser ischiatic nerves are to be traced, ramifying in the sub- cutaneous tissue of the inner and upper part of the leg.

233 MUCOUS MEMBRANE OP THE NOSE. The veins of the nose correspond with the arteries. They communicate with the veins within the cranium through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; also through the ophthalmic vein and the cavernous sinus. These com- munications explain the relief frequently afforded by hsemorrhage from the nose in cases of cerebral congestion. The mucous membrane of the nose is supplied with sensory nerves by the fifth pair. Thus, its roof is supplied with filaments from the external branch of the nasal nerve, and from the Vidian ; its outer wall, by filaments from the superior nasal branches of the spheno-palatine ganglion, from the nasal, from the inner branch of the anterior dental, and from the inferior nasal branches of the large palatine nerve; its septiom, by the septal branch of the nasal nerve, by the nasal branches of the spheno-palatine ganglion, by the naso-palatine, and by the Vidianits floor, by the naso- palatine, and the inferior nasal branches of the large palatine nerve. Olfactoet The olfactory nerves, proceeding from each Nerves. olfactory bulb, in number about twenty on each side, pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. In its passage each nerve is invested with a coat derived from the dura mater. They are arranged into an inner, a middle, and an outer set. The inner, which are the largest, traverse the grooves in the upper third of the septum. The middle ramify on the roof of the nose. The outer pass through grooves in the upper and middle turbinated bones and the os planum of the ethmoid. The nerves descend between the mucous membrane and the periosteum, and break up into filaments which communicate freely with one another, and form minute plexuses with small elongated intervals. Microscopically, the filaments differ from the other cerebral nerves, in containing no white substance of Schwann, and in being pale, finely granular, and nucleated.

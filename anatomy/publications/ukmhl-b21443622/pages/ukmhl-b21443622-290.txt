272 CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE ARM. posterior winds round to the back of the forearm behind the internal condyle, and communicates with the nerve of Wrisberg and the ulnar nerve. The ksser internal cutaneous {nerve of Wrisberg) perforates the fascia about the lower third of the arm, and supplies the skin over the internal condyle and the olecranon. This nerve, as it lies close to the Fig. 55. 1. Acromial \ branches 2. Clavicular branches of the su- perficial cer- vical plexus* 3. Cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve. 4.

DISTRIBUTION OF CUTA.NEOTIS NERVES TO THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER AND ABM^ axillary vein^ communicates with the first or second intercosto-humeral nerve. The internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral oierve pierces the fascia, and supplies the skin of the inner side of the middle of the ai-m. The cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve pierce the fascia over the insertion of the deltoid, and supply the skin of the upper half of the arm on its outer side.

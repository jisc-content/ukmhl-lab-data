POSITION OF ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 376 makes a bend—the hepatic flexure—and crosses the umbilical region towards the left side. Having reached the lower border of the spleen, it makes another bend downwards, forming the sple- nic flexure of the colon ;* thence it descends in front of tlie left kidneyt through the left lumbar region into the left iliac fossa, where it curves like the letter S. These successive portions of the large intestine are termed, respectirely, the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid parts of its course. Lastly, the bowel enters the pelvis on the left side of the sacrum, and here takes the name of rectum. This term, so far as concerns the human subject, is misapplied; the canal runs anything but a straight course through the pelvis, since it curves to adapt itself to the sacrum. Pig. 76. RELATIVE POSITION OF THE KIDNEYS ANB THE LARGE INTESTINE SEEN FROM BEHIND. L. K. Left kidney, crossed obliquely by the last a. c. Ascending colon dorsal artery and nerve. D. c. Descending colon. R. K.- Bight kidney. Looking at the entire course of the colon, observe that it forms an arch, of which the concavity embraces the convolutions of the small intestines. ■ * This transverse part of the colon, in some instances, makes a coil behind the storaa-ch to the diaphragm; such a state of things, when the bowel happens to be dis- tended, is apt to give rise to symptoms of diseased heart. See -some observations in point by Dr. Copland, in 'Lond. Med. Gaz.' 1847, vol. v. p. 660. t The contiguity of the ascending and descending colon to the right and left kid- ney respectively, explains the occasional bursting of renal abscesses into the intesti- nal canal.

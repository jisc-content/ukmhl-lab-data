8 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. Sinuses of the It is one of the peculiarities of the cerebral cir- D0RA Matkr. culation, that the blood is returned through canals or sinuses formed by the dura mater. These canals are produced Em. 2. by a splitting of the dura mater into two layers as shown in fig. 2, where 1 represents a vertical section through the superior longi- tudinal sinus. They are lined by the same smooth membrane as the rest of the venous system. Since their walls consist of un- yielding structure, and are always on the stretch, it is obvious that they are admir- ably adapted to resist the pressure of the brain. There are fifteen of these sinuses; five are pairs, and five are single, as follows: The five pairs of sinuses are— The fire single sinuses are— The lateral. The superior longitudinal. The superior petrosal. The inferior petrosal. The cavernous. The occipital. DIAGRAM TO SHOW FORMA' TION OF A SINUS. The inferior longitudinal. The circular. The transverse. The straight.

It begins very small at the crista galli, gradually increases in size in its course backwards, and op- posite the internal protuberance of the occipital bone divides into the right and left lateral sinuses, the right being generally the larger. Besides numerous veins from the cancellous texture of the skull-cap, the superior longitudinal sinus re- ceives large veins from each hemi- sphere of the cerebrum. It is interesting to observe that these veins run ( as a rule) from behind forwards, contrary to the current 1. Superior longitudinal sinus. 2. Inferior longitudinal sinus, .'i. Straight sinus. 4, 4.

DISSECTION OP THE THORAX. 123 occupied by the heart and large vessels takes the name of the middle mediastinum. Looking at the chest in front, the anterior mediastinum ap- pears as shown in the diagram (p. 125). It is not precisely ver- tical in its direction, for it inclines slightly towards the left, owing to the position of the heart. Its area varies : thus it is extremely narrow in the middle where the edges of the lungs nearly meet; but it is wider above and below, where the lungs diverge. Poste- riorly it is limited by the pericardium covering the heart, aorta and its branches, and the pulmonary artery. What parts are contained in the anterior mediastinum ?â€”The remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and triangularis sterni muscles, the left brachio- cephalic vein (which crosses behind the first bone of the sternum) a few lymphatic glands, and the left internal mammary artery and vems.

DIAGHAM OF THE REFLECTIONS OF THE PLETIEAL SACS IN DOTTED LINES. The posterior mediastinum (fig. 20) contains the oesophagus, the two pneumogastric nerves, the aorta, the thoracic duct, the vena azygos, the trachea, and some lymphatic glands.

251 LIGAMENTS OP THE RIBS. AETicnrATioN All the ribs, with the exception of the first and OF THE Ribs. the two last, are articulated with the bodies of two vertebrae, and witJi the transverse processes (fig. 49). The head of eaoh rib presents two articular surfaces, correspond- insr to the bodies of two vertebrae. There are two distinct articu- lations, each^ provided with a separate synovial membrane. The ligaments are :—1. An anterior, which connects the head of the rib with the vertebi'se, ^and with the intervening fibro-cartilage: this, on account of the divergence of its fibres, is called the stel- late ligament (fig. ,50). 2.. An inter-articular, .which, proceeds from the head of the rib to the intervertebral cartilage. Fig. 49. DIAGHAM SHOWING THE LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE EIB ■WITH THE TEKTEBRA. 1. The anterior costo-central ligament. 3. The posterior costc-transverse ligament. 2. The interosseous, or middle oosto-transverse 4. The synovial membrane between the rib and ligament. the body of the vertebra. The tubercle of the rib articulates with the transverse process. This articulation has a capsular and synovial membrane, and is secured by the following ligaments:—1. The posterior costo- transverse passes from the apex of the transverse process to the summit of the tubercle of the rib. 2. The middle costo-trans- verse connects the neck of the rib to the frout surface of the transverse process. 3. The superior costo-transverse Siscends from the neck of the rib to the lower border of the transverse process above it (fig. 50).

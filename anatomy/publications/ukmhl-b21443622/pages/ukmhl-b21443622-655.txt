637 DISSECTION OF THE EYE. chiefly from the anterior ciliary, and from the front vessels of the choroid; and after breaking up into a fine plexus, they form loops which arch backwards to end in the smaller veins. Their dark colour arises from pigmented cells, which disappear, however, at the free ends of the processes. Under the microscope the choroid is seen to consist of two layers, both composed of blood-vessels held together by fine connective tissue, in which are found large ramified pigment-cells. The outer layer consists of the larger branches of the blood-vessels; the Fm. 162. Sclerotic coat . . . Veins of the choroid. Ciliary nerves . . . Veins of the choroid. body.

The veins are arranged with great regularity in drooping branches (vasa vorticosa), like a weeping-willow (fig. 162), and converge to four or five nearly equidistant trunks, which, after running backwards for a short distance, perforate the sclerotic not far from the entrance of the optic nerve, and empty themselves into the ophthalmic vein. The inner layer is formed by the capillaries of the ciliary arteries, and is called, after the Dutch anatomist Ruysch, ' tunica Ruyschiana.'' It consists of the most delicate vascular network found in any tissue, and extends forwards to the ciliary processes, with the capillaries of which it freely communicates.

The cut surface presents a mass of white substance White and surrounded by a tortuous layer of grey matter, Gbky Matter. about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. Tliis grey substance consists of four layersâ€”two of grey alternating with two of white, the most external layer being white. In some places, chiefly at the base of the brain, six layers have been demonstrated. Fig. 146. Fig. 147. trPPEB SURFACE OF COR- PUS CALLOSUM. 1, 1. -LineEe transveKae. 2, Rapli6. 3, 3.

Corpus Callo- This transverse portion of white substance is the chief connecting medium between the two hemispheres, and is called the great transverse commissure of the cerebrum. It is about four inches long, and is rather nearer to the front than to the back part of the brain. It is, moreover, thicker at the ends than in the middle. Its surface is slightly arched from before backwards. A shallow groove, called the raphe, runs along the middle of its upper sm-face (tig. 146) ; in a

The membrane is supplied with blood from the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior am-icular, and the Vidian.

OssicxjLA The three small bones in the tympanum are AuDiTus. named after their fancied resemblance to certain implements, the malleus, incus, and stapes. They are articulated Fig. 166. " to each other by perfect joints, and are so placed that the chain somewhat resembles the letter Z. Their use is to transmit the vibrations of the membrana tympani to the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, and, through it, to the fluid contained within the vestibule. But they have another use, which would be THE OSSICLES OF THE BIGHT iucompatiblo wlth a single bone—namely, TYMPANUM. permit the tightening and relaxation of c. stapes.

The malleus, or hammer bone, consists of an upper part or head, which is suspended to the roof of the tympanum by the sus- pensory ligament, and articulates posteriorly with the incus. From it proceeds the handle, which is nearly vertical, and is attached along its whole length to the upper half of the membrana tympani. The long process (processus gracilis) projects at right angles from the head of the malleus, runs into the Grlaserian fissure, and receives the insertion of the laxator tympani. The processus brevis, situated at the junction of the long process and the head, looks towards the membrana tympani, and receives the insertion of the tensor tympani. The incus, or anvil bone, is shaped like a tooth with two unequal widely separated fangs. Its broad part or body presents a concavo- convex articulation for the head of the malleus; its long process

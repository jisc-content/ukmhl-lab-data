PTERTGO-MAXILLAEY REGION. 98 Dissection. To gain a good view of the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the pterygo-maxillary region, a portion of the ascending ramus of the jaw must be removed with a Hey's saw, as shown in the diagram below. In this region we have to examine the two pterygoid muscles, the trunk and branches of the internal maxillary artery, the inferior maxillary nerve, and the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. All these structures are imbedded in loose soft fat, which must be cautiously removed without injuring them. Fig. 16. Anterior deep temporal n. and a. Infra-orbital a.

This muscle arises by two heads, one, the upper, from the great wing of the sphenoid and from the ridge below it; the lower, from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, a few fibres taking origin from the outer side

622 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. penetrates about one-third of the substance of the cord. It con- tains a fold of pia mater, with many blood-vessels for the supply of its interior. At the bottom of this fissure is a transverse layer of white substance, named the anterior white commissure, connecting the two anterior halves of the cord. The posterior fissure is so much less apparent than the' anterior, that some anatomists deny its existence; but by careful preparation it can be demonstrated, although it does not contain a fold of pia mater. Indeed, it can be traced to a greater depth than the anterior, and reaches down as far as the posterior grey commissure of the cord. Besides the anterior and posterior fissures, along each half of the cord are two superficial grooves, from which the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves respectively emerge.

The posterior leads down to the posterior horn of the grey matter in the interior of the cord; the anterior is simply the groove from which the anterior roots emerge. By these lateral fissures each half of the cord is divided into three longitudinal columnsâ€”an anterior, a, pos- terior, and a lateral. On each side of the posterior median fissure is a slender column, called the posterior median column, which is separated from the posterior column by a shallow furrow.

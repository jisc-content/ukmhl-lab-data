PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. 365 Inferiorly, it is attached to the crest of the ilium and to Poupart's ligament, where it becomes continuous with the fascia covering the iliacus internus (fascia iliaca). About the middle of Poupart's ligament it sends a funnel-shaped prolongation downwards into the thigh, forming the anterior part of the sheath of the femoral vessels. Its inner border is connected with the margin of the rectus, to the lower margin of the conjoined tendon,-and also to the pubes. This fascia is strongest just behind the external Fig. 73. 4,4.

The outer half of the fascia is very firmly connected to Poupart's ligament and to the fascia iliaca; but the inner half is loosely connected with the crural arch, and passes down under it, as before stated, over the femoral vessels into the thigh, and forms the front of what is termed the femoral sheath.

A perpendicular section through it shows that it consists of concentric layers, and that its general structure resembles that between the bodies of the vertebra. In the upper and back part of this fibro-cartilage is a Fig. 13.0. nio-fetnoral or accessory liga- ment of the hip-joint. smooth cavity lined with epithelium. The cartilage acts like a buffer, and breaks the force of shocks passing through the pelvic arch. The ilium is connected with the fifth lumbar vertebra by the ilio-lumhar ligament. It is very strong, and extends from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium (fig. 131).

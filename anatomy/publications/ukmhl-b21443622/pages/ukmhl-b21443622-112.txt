TEMPORAL EEGION. 94 The tem'poro-malar nerve, one or more (branch of the supe- rior maxillary), issues through the canal in the malar bone and supplies the cheek and side of the temple. The mental nerve is a branch of the inferior maxillary or third division of the fifth. It emerges from the mental foramen in the lower jaw, in a direction upwards and backwards, beneath the depressor labii inferioris. It soon divides into a number of branches, some of which supply the skin of the chin, but the greater number terminate in the papillae of the lower lip. It communicates with the facial nerve. The mental artery is a branch of the inferior dental. It sup- plies the gums and the chin, and inosculates with the sub-mental, the inferior labial, and inferior coronary arteries. MUSCLES OF MASTICATION.â€”TEMPOEAL AND PTERYGO-MAXILLAEY REGIONS. In this dissection, the parts should be examined in the following order: 1. Superficial arteries and nerves of the 5. Pterygoid muscles. temple. 6. Internal maxillary artery and 2. Masseter muscle. branches. 3. Temporal aponeurosis. 7. Inferior maxillary nerve and 4. Temporal muscle. branches. Eeflect the skin of the temple from below upwards. Beneath the skin you come upon a layer of tough connective tissue, con- tinuous, above, with the aponeurosis of the scalp, below, with the fascia covering the masseter and the parotid gland. In this tissue are contained the superficial temporal vessels and nerves. Tempokal This is the smaller of the two terminal branches Artbbt. of the external carotid. Arising in the sub- stance of the parotid gland near the neck of the jaw, it passes over the root of the zygoma, close to the meatus auditorius, ascends for about 1-^ inches on the temporal fascia, and there divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Above the zygoma it is superficial, being covered only by the attrahens

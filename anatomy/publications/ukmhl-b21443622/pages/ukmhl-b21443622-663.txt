DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 645 The ViTREors ^'^^ vitreous body is a transparent, gelatinous- BoDT AND THE lookiug siiLstance, which fills up nearly four-fifths Hyaloid Mem- of the interior of the globe (p. 634). It can be BRANE. easily separated from the retina, except at the optic disc; in front it presents a deep depression, in which the crystalline lens is embedded. It is surrounded by a delicate transparent membrane, the hyaloid membrane, which forms a capsule for the vitreous body, and is sufficiently strong to keep it in shape after the stronger tunics of the eye have been removed. When the vitreous humour has been hardened in chromic acid it is rendered somewhat opaque, and presents, especially at its outer part, a lamellar appearance. It consists of a fluid con- tained in the meshes of a cellular structure, which communicate freely with each other j for if any part of it be punctured, the humour gradually drains away.* If examined carefully, the lamellation is seen to be arranged concentrically, the layers, as they approach the centre, becoming less firm in consistence. The vitreous, moreover, on a transverse section shows a radial striation, but whether this exists naturally, or is the result of post-mortem changes, or from chemical reagents, is not known. Eunning through the middle from before backwards is a small canal— canal of Stilling—about a line in diameter, which contains fluid, and is broader behind than in front; this in the foetus lodges a ii^^^^^fek small branch of the retinal artery, which ii^^^^^^Mk ramifies on the back of the capsule of the lens. ^^^^^^^ Zo o Z NN Surrounding the hollow /^'^^^^^^^^^ in the vitreous which re- W / ^^^^^^^M ceives the crystalline lens is the zone of ^^^SeM^ Zinn,\ This zone is best exposed by remov- ^^^^^^^ ™^ ing the ciliary processes.

RADIO-CARPAL JOINT. 347. essential to the pronation and supination of the hand. These corresponding surfaces are covered with a thin layer of cartilage, and are provided with a very loose synovial membrane. The jomt is strengthened in front and behind by thin transverse ligamentous fibres, which extend from the anterior and posterior borders of the sio-moid cavity of the radius to the anterior and posterior surfaces of^the styloid process of the ulna. But the principal uniting me- dium between the bones is the following strong fibro-cartilage :— Fig. 67. 1. External lateral liga- ment 2. Internal lateral liga- ment. 3. Interarticular fibro- cartilage between radius and ulna. 4. Interosseous liga- ments. 5. Lateral ligaments of the intercar- pal joint. DIAGRAM OF THE LIGAMENTS AND SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES OF TUE WEIST-.T0:NT. Fibro-cartilage between the radius and ulna.—Saw through the bones of the forearm, and separate them by cutting through the interosseous membrane, and opening the synovial membrane of the joint between the lower ends. Thus a good view is ob- tained of the fibro-cartilage which connects them (fig. 67). It is triangiilar, and placed transversely at the lower end of the ulna, filling up the interval caused by the greater length of the radius. Its base is attached to the lower end of the radius ; its apex to

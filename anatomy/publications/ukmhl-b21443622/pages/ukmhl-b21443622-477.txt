DISSECTION OP THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 459 by filaments of the sympathetic nerve proceeding from the hypo- gastric plexus.* The lymphatics proceeding from the glans and the integument of the penis join the inguinal glands. The lymphatics of the gians communicate freely all round it: this explains why a venereal sore on one side sometimes affects the inguinal glands on the other. The deep lymphatics from the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum join the lymphatics of the pelvis. DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PERINEUM. The pudenda in the female consist of folds of the integument, called the labia. Between these is a longitudinal fissure which leads to the orifices of the urinary and genital canals. Lab a Ma o a "^^^ pubic region is generally surmounted by an accumulation of fat, called mons Veneris, which is covered with hair. From this, two thick folds of skin descend, one on either side, constituting the labia majora, and gradually diminish in thickness towards the perineum. Their junction, about one inch above the anus, is called the posterior commissure, or frcenulum lab iorum : it is generally torn in the first labour. The inner layer of the skin of the labium is thinner, softer, and more like mucous membrane than the outer: for this reason, whenever pus forms in the labium, the abscess bursts on the inner side. Where the labia are in contact, they are provided with small sebaceous glands, of which the minute ducts are observ- able on the surface. ^ In form and structure the clitoris resembles the penis on a diminutive scale, being about an inch and a half long. It has, however, no corpus spongiosum, or urethra. Like the penis, it is attached to the sides of the pubic arch by two crura (fig. 104, p. 461), each of which is grasped by its special erector clitoridis. The crura are continued forward â™¦ Krause has described end-bulbs on the nerves, and Pacinian corpuscles have likewise been discovered on the nerves of the glans.

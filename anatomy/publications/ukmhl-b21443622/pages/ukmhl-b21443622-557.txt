GLUTEAL EEaiON. 539 Emerging from the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis, it descends over the external rotator muscles of the thigh, along the interval between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter, but rather nearer to the former ; so that, in the sitting position, the nerve is protected from pressure by this bony prominence. The nerve does not descend quite perpendicu- larly, but rather obliquely forwards upon the adductor magnus, parallel with the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, and below the middle of the thigh divides into the internal popliteal and the peroneal (or external popliteal). It is accompanied by a branch Fig. 123. 1. Gluteus medius. 2. Pyriformis. 3. Lesser sciatic nerve. 4. Obturator internus, with the two gemelli. 5. Coccygens. 6. Great sciatic nerve. 7.

DEEP MUSCLES OF THE GLUTEAL REGION. of the ischiatic artery, called the comes nervi ischiatici* The * nerve distributes branches to the hamstring muscles and the adductor magnus, and sends a small branch to the hip-joint which pierces the posterior part of the capsular ligament. LE.SSEB This comes from the lower part of the sacral Ischiatic Nerve, plexus. It leaves the pelvis with the greater * The arteria comes nervi ischiatici runs generally by the side of the nerve, but sometimes in the centre of it. This artery becomes one of the chief channels by which the blood reaches the lower limb after ligature of the femoral. See in the Museum of the Hoyal College of Surgeons a preparation in which the femoral was tied by Jolin Hunter/fifty years before the man's death.

310 SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The dissection of the remaining- muscles of the palm, called, from their position, interossei, must be, for the present, post- poned. MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE ARM. ^ Make an incision down the spine from the Dissection, . occiput to the sacrum ; another, from the last dorsal vertebra upwards and outwards to the acromion ; and a third, frona the sacrum along the crest of the ilium ; then reflect the skin outwards from the dense subcutaneous tissue, in which will be found the following cutaneous nerves. CuTANROTjs These are derived from the posterior divisions Neeves of the of the spinal nerves, and correspond, generally, to the number of the vertebra. The posterior primary branches, much smaller than the anterior, divide, between the transverse processes, into external and internal branches. From the internal, which become superficial near the spines of the vertebra, are derived those branches which supply the skin in the cervical and upper dorsal regions; from the external, which appear near the angles of the ribs, are derived those which supply the skin of the lower dorsal and lumbar regions. In the cervical and upper dorsal region, the cutaneous nerves perforate the com- plexus, splenius, and trapezius; in the lower dorsal and lumbar .region, they perforate the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi. As might be expected, the external branches are the larger, especially in the loins, where some of them descend over the crest of the ilium, and terminate in the skin of the buttock. Among these cutaneous nerves, notice, at this stage of the dis- section, the following:â€” 1. The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve is called the great occipital. It perforates the complexus, and ramifies on the back of the scalp with the occipital artery. 2. The posterior branch of the third cein)lcal nerve sometimes sends a branch to the back of the scalp.

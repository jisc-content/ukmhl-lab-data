DISSECTION OF THE TESTIS. 666 Testis. The testicle is a gland of an oval shape with flattened sides, suspended obliquely, so that the upper end is directed forwards and outwards, the lower end in the reverse direction. The left is generally a little the lower of the two. Each testis is about an inch and a half in length, and one in breadth, and weighs about six drachms ; but few organs present greater variations in size and weight, even in men of the same age ; generally speaking, the left is the larger. The front and sides of the testes are smooth, and covered with the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis; but along the posterior part of the gland Fig. 169. 1.

EPIDinXMIS. is placed a long narrow body, termed the epididy- mis; this is not a part of the testicle, but an appendage to it, formed by the convolirtions of its long excretory duct. Its upper larger end is called the globus major, and is connected with the testicle by the efferent ducts; the lower end, globus minor, is only connected with the testicle by fibrous tissue ; that part of the epididymis between these two portions is called the body. A considerable quantity of unstriped muscular fibre exists at the posterior part of the epididymis and testis beneath the infundibuliform fascia, and has been described by KoUiker as the inner muscular tunic.

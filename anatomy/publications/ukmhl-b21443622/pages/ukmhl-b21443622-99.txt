STRUOTUKE OF THE EYELIDS. 81 for a short distance nearly vertically, and then dilating into a small pouch makes a sharp bend inwards for about a quarter of an inch to join the lachrymal sac; the lower canal descends perpendicularly, and, like the upper, makes a sharp bend, after which it pursues a direction upwards and inwards to the sac. The two canals open separately into the sac (sometimes by ^ Pie, 14, a common orifice). In facial palsy, the tensor tarsi being affected, the puncta lose their proper direction, and the tears flow over the cheek. In the introduction of probes for the purpose of opening the con- tracted puncta, or of slitting up the lachrymal ducts, it is necessary to know the exact direction of these canals. {8ee diagram.) When from any cause the tears are secreted in greater quantity than usual, they overflow and trickle down the cheek Meibomian These compound sebaceous glands, so called Glands. after the anatomist* who first described them, are situated on the under surface of each of the tarsal carti- lages. In the upper lid there are between twenty and thirty; not quite so many in the lower. On everting the lid, they are seen running in longitudinal rows in grooves of the cartilage. Under the microscope, they are seen to consist of a straight central tube, round the sides of which are a number of openings leading to short csecal dilatations. The orifices of these glands are situated on the free margin of the lids behind the lashes. They are lined with flattened epithelial cells which, in the caecal dilatations, become cubical. Their function is to secrete a sebaceous material, which prevents the lids from sticking together. Let us now examine the muscles in connection with the nose : namelyâ€”the pyramidalis nasi, the compressor naris or alse nasi, and the depressor alse nasi. All are supplied by the facial nerve. * H.

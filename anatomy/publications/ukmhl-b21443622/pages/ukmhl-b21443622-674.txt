DISSECTION OF THE OEGAN OP HEARING. 656 Each canal forms about two-thirds of a circle, and is about one- twentieth of an inch in diameter. They open at each extremity into the vestibule, therefore there should be six apertures for them ; but there are only five, since one of the apertures is common to tlie extremities of two canals. The canals are not of equal diameter throughout; each presents at one end a dilatation termed the ampulla, about one-tenth of an inch in diameter. This dila- tation corresponds to a similar dilatation of the membranous sac, upon which the auditory nerve expands. Each canal differs in its direction; they are named accordingly, supenor, posterior, and external. The superior s. c. is also the most anterior of the three ; its direction is vertical, and runs across the petrous bone; the ampulla is at the outer extremity.

THE OSSEOUS COCHLEA. opens by a common orifice with the posterior s. c. The posterior s. c. is also vertical, runs parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone, and consequently, at right angles to the preceding; the ampulla is at the lower end. The external s. c. is horizontal in position, with the convexity of the arch directed backwards; the ampulla is at the outer end. The cochlea is the most anterior part of the internal ear : it very closely resembles a common snail's shell, and is placed so that the base of the shell corresponds to the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, while the apex 'is directed forwards and outwards. Its base is about a quarter of an inch in diameter. It consists of the spiral convolutions of two parallel and gradually tapering tubes, which wind round a central pillar, called the modiolus.

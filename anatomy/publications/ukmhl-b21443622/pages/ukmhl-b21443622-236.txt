218 SUPEEIOE MAXILLARY NERVE. DISSECTION OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. To trace this nerve and its branches we must remove the outer wall of the orbit as far as the foramen rotundum, so as to expose the spheno-maxillary fossa. The superior maxillary nerve is the second division of the fifth cranial nerve. Proceeding from the Gasserian ganglion (fig. 43), Fig. 43. Trunk of the filth nerve . Gasserian gan- glion . . .

Otic ganglion. it leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum, and passes hori- zontally forwards across the spheno-maxillary fossa. It then passes into the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, enters the infra-orbital canal with the corresponding artery, and finally emerges upon the face, through the infra-orbital foramen, beneath the levator labii superioris. The branches given off are :â€” a. The orbital branch already described (p. 217). h. Two branches, which descend to the spheno-palatine ganjlion (Meckel's), situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa (p. 220).

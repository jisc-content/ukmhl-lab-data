DISSECTION OP THE ORBIT. 207 the remainder removed by bone forceps. The eyeball should be made tense by blowing air through a blow-pipe, passed well into the globe through the end of the optic nerve. Pehiosteum of The roof being removed, we expose the fibrous THE CeBIT. membrane, which lines the walls of the orbit. It is a continuation of the dura mater through the sphenoidal fissure. Traced forwards, we find that at the margin of the orbit it divides into two layers, one of which is continuous with the periosteum of the forehead, the other forms the broad tarsal ligament which fixes the tarsal cartilage. Fig. 40. DIAGRAM OF THE NERVES OF THE ORBIT. Fascia OF The fascia of the orbit serves the same piu-pose THE Orbit. ^jj^t fascia does in other parts. It provides the lachrymal gland, and each of the muscles, with a loose sheath, thin and delicate at the back of the orbit, but stronger near the eye, where it passes from one rectus muscle to the other, so that their tendinous insertions into the globe are connected by it. From the insertion of the muscles it is reflected backwards over the globe of the eye, and the optic nerve, and separates the eye from the fat at the bottom of the orbit.

SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 10 right is usually the larger. Each commences at the internal occipital protuberance, and proceeds at first horizontally outwards, enclosed between the layers of the tentorium, along a groove in the occipital bone and the posterior inferior angle of the parietal; it then descends along the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and again indenting the occipital bone, turns forwards to the foramen lacerum posterius, and terminates in the internal jugular vein.* Infeeioe Lon- This is of small size.

It runs along the line of junction of the falx cerebri with the tentorium cerebelli, and terminates at the divergence of the two lateral sinuses. It receives the two venoB Galeni (fig. 3), which return the blood from the lateral ventricles of the brain. Cayebnous This is so called because its interior is inter- SiNus. sected by numerous cords. It extends along the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, outside the internal carotid artery. It receives the ophthalmic vein which leaves the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure ; and it communicates with the circular sinus which surrounds the pituitary gland (fig- 4> This surrounds the pituitary body (P in the CiECULAB Sinus. , . , i • i -xi. diagram 4), and communicates on eacb side witn the cavernous sinus.

617 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL COED. To examine, in situ, the spinal cord covered with its mem- bi-anes, the arches of the vertebrae must be sawn through, and removed. It is then noticed that the cord does not occupy the whole cavity of the spinal canal. The dura mater does not adhere to the vertebra, and does not form their internal periosteum, as in the skull. Between the bones and this membrane, a space inter- venes, which is filled with a soft reddish-looking fat, with watery cellular tissue, and the ramifications of a plexug of veins. Fig. 154. 1.

Spinal System The spine is remarkable for the number of large OF Veins. and tortuous veins which ramify about it, inside and outside the vertebral canal (fig. 154).* There are—1. The posterior external veins which form a tortuous plexus outside the arches and spinous processes of the vertebrae; they send ofi" branches, which pass through the ligamenta subflava, and end in the plexus inside the vertebral canal. 2. The veins of the bodies of the vertebrm emerge from the backs of the bodies, and empty themselves into — 3. the anterior longitudinal spinal veins; these, two in number, one on each side, are the * Vide Brescliet, 'Essai sur les Veines du Rachis,' 4to.; ' Traits Anatomique sur le Systeme Veineux, fol. avec planches,' 1829; also Cloquet, 'Trait6 d'Anatomie descriptiro.'

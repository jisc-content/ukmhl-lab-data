PARTS CONOEENED IN FEMOEAL HEENIA. 506 3. The femoral artery and vein with the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve. These muscles and vessels fill up the space beneath the crural arch, except on the inner side of the femoral vein, where a space is left for the passage of the lymphatics : this is called the crural or femoral ring. The muscles are separated from the vessels by a strong vertical fibrous partition passing from the arch to the bone, which is nothing more than a continuation of the sheath of the psoas. The artery, too, is separated from the vein by a similar, although a much weaker partition, and there is Fig. 117. External cutaneous n.. Ildacus Anterior cniral n. . . Psoas Crural arch.

These three partitions not only keep all the parts in their right place, but confine the arch down to the bone, and prevent its being uplifted by any pro- trusion between it and the muscles and vessels. This, coupled with the close attachment of the fascia iliaca to the crural arch, explains why a femoral hernia rarely takes place in any other situation than on the inner side of the femoral vein.* * If the partitions from any cause yield, or become sl?ck, then a rupture may de- scend in front of the vessels, or even (though this is rare) on the outer side of the artery.

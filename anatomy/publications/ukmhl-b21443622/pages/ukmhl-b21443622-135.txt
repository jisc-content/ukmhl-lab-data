SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK. 117 The infeHor cervical ganglion is of considerable size, and is situated in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first rib, immediately behind the vertebral artery. It receives branches from the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, and others which, descending from the fourth fifth and sixth, through the foramina in the transverse processes of the vertebrae, form a plexus around the vertebral artery. The branches which it gives off are— a. Inferior Cardiac Nerve.—This communicates with the reciurent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerves, and joins the cardiac plexus beneath the arch of the aorta. h. Nerves to the Blood-vessels.—These ramify around the vertebral and subclavian arteries.

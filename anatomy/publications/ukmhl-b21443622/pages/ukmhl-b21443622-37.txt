ANTEEIOR JUGULAR VEIN. 19 Near the angle of the jaw the esternal jugular vein communi- cates by a large branch with the internal jugular. Before its termination the external jugular vein generally re- ceives the supra-scapular, posterior scapular, and other unnamed veins: a disposition very unfavourable for the surgeon, because there is a confluence of veins immediately over the subclavian arteinj in the place where it is usually tied.

Antebior The anterior jugular vein is situated more in JugulabVein. the middle of the neck, and is much smaller than the external jugular. It commences by small branches below the chin, and runs down the front of the neck, nearly to the sternum: it then curves outwards, beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and opens either into the external jugular or the subclavian vein. We commonly meet with two anterior jugular veins, one on either side; immediately above the sternum they communicate by a transverse branch.

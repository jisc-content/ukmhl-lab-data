THORACIC DUCT. 142 INTERCOS'rV^ intercostal arteries. When the vein reaches the level of the third dorsal vertehra, it arches over the right bronchus, and terminates in the superior vena cava, just before this vessel is covered by pericardium. In its course it receives all the right intercostal veins, the spinal veins, the oesophageal and commonly the right bronchial vein. Opposite the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra it is joined by the left vena azygos. The left vena azygos, vena azygos minor, runs up the left side of the spine. This vein commences in the abdomen from one of the lumbar veins of the left side, or from the left renal. It then ascends on the left side of the aorta, through the aortic opening in the dia- phragm. On a level with the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra, it passes beneath the aorta and thoracic duct to join the azygos major. Before passing beneath the aorta it usually communicates with the left superior intercostal vein. It generally receives six or seven of the lower intercostal veins of the left side. These azygos veins are provided with imperfect valves, and are supple- mental to the inferior vena cava.

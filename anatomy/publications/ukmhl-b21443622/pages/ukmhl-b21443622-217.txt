199 DISSECTION OP THE LARYNX. M. Thyro- This muscle arises from the angle of the ARTTExoiDEus. thjroid Cartilage and the crico-thyroid membrane, runs horizontally backwards, and is inserted into the base and anterior border of the arytenoid. Its fibres run parallel with tlie vocal cord, and some of them are directly inserted into it. Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal. This muscle relaxes the vocal cord. More than this, it puts the lip of the glottis in the vocalising position ; in this position, the margins of the glottis are parallel, and the chink is reduced to the breadth of a shilling. Fig. 38. The following table shows the action of the several muscles which act upon the glottis :â€” Crico-thyroidei , . . Stretch the vocal cords. Thyro-arytenoidei , . Eelax the vocal cords, and place them in the vocalising position, Crico-arytenoidei postici . Dilate the glottis. Crico-arytenoidei laterales . Draw together the arytenoid cartilages Arytenoideus . . . Ditto ditto ditto Aryteno-epiglottidei . . Contract the upper opening of the larynx. The blood-vessels of the larynx are derived from the superi ) close the J glottis.

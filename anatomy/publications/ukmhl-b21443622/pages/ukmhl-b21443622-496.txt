STRUCTUEE OF THE LIVEE. 478 the great liability of the liver to be lacerated by external violence, or by the action of the abdominal muscles. Lobules. consists of an aggregation of small polyhedral masses called lobules, which range from -h to yL of an inch in diameter. These lobules are marked out by septa of areolar tissue, and in a transverse section have the appearance of mosaic pavement (fig. 108); but in a perpendicular section they somewhat resemble an oak-leaf (fig. 109). Each lobule consists of a. minute plexus of blood-vessels, ducts, and cells Fig. 108. a. Inter-lobular rein. 6. Intra-lobular or cen- tral vein.

It will facilitate the understanding of the branchings of the different hepatic vessels, if it be borne in mind, 1, that the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, ramify together from first to last—inclosed in a sheath of areolar tissue, called Glisson's capsule; 2, that the hepatic veins run alone from first to last, and terminate in the inferior vena cava as it passes under the liver. The portal vein, on entering the substance of the liver, gives off numerous small branches, which pass between the lobules and

SIDE VIEW OP THE PELVIC VISOEEA. 435 very large and form loop-like plexuses about the lower part of the rectum. Having no valves, they are liable to become dilated and congested from various internal causes ; hence the frequency of hjBmorrhoidal affections.

When contracted, the bladder sinks into the pelvis behind the pubic arch, and is completely protected from injury. But, as it gradually distends, it rises out of the pelvis into the abdomen, and, in cases of extreme distension, may reach nearly up Fig. 97. 1. Ureter. 2. Vas deferens. seniinali.s.

The form f of the distended bladder is * "When the bladder is completely paralysed it becomes like an inorganic sac, and there seems to be no limit to its distension. Haller found, in a drunkard, the bladder SO dilated that it would hold twenty pints of water. (' Elem. Phys. art. Vesica.') Frank saw a bladder so distended as to resemble ascites, and evacuated from it twelve pounds of urine. (Oratio de Signis morborum, &c. &c. Ticiui, 1788.) W. Hunter, in his ' Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus,' has given the representation of a bladder distended nearly as high as the ensiforra cartilage. f In all animals with a bladder, the younger the animal the more elongated is the bladder. This is indicative of its original derivation from a tube, i.e. the urachus. In the infant, the bladder is of a pyriform shape, as it is, permanently, in the quad- ruped ; but as we assume more and more the perpendicular attitude, the weight of the urine gradually makes the lower part more capaciouF.

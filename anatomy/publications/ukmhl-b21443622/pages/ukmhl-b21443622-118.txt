INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 100 external pterygoid, and terminates by dividing into numerous branches. The course of this artery is divided into three stages. In the first, the artery lies between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament; in the second, it lies either over or under the external pterygoid ; in the third, it lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa. BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY IN THE THREE STAGES OF ITS COURSE. Branches in the First Stage. a. Tympanic. b. Meningea media. c. Meningea parva. d. Inferior dental.

Branches in «• The tympanic ascends behind the articulation of THE First Part. the jaw, and passes through the Glaserian fissure to the tympanum. It supplies that cavity and the membrana tympani, and anastomoses with the stylo-mastoid and Yidian arteries. This artery is not infrequently given off from a branch of the internal maxillaiy artery. b. The middle meningeal artery ascends between the two roots of the auriculo-temporal nerve, behind the external pterygoid, and enters through the foramen spinosum into the cranium, where it ramifies between the dura mater and the bones. Its further course is described at p. 12. c. The meningea parva (not marked in the plan) ascends through the foramen ovale into the skull, and supplies chiefly the gangUon of the fifth pair. It often comes from the meningea media. d. The inferior dental artery descends behind the neck of the jaw to the dental foramen, which it entsrs with the dental nerve. It then pro-

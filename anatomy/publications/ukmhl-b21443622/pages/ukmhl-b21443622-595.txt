577 SYNOVIAL MEMBEANE8 OP THE TARSUS. These joints are maintained in position, above, by dorsal tarso- metatarsal ligaments, and, below, by ^plantar ligaments. Inter- osseous ligaments.-also pass between the wedge bones, keeping them in their respective places (fig. 137). The metatarsal bones are connected to those at their proximal and distal ends, by dorsal and plantar ligaments: those at the proximal extremities are very strong, and are supplemented by interosseous fibres, as in the metacarpus, p. 350. The distal extremities of the metatarsal bones are united by the transverse metatarsal, ligament; this extends from the great to the little toe on theiK plantar surfaces.

Between the posterior articular surface-of the os calcis and that of the astragalus. 2. Between the head of the astragalus and the scaphoid, and between the anterior articular surface of the astragalus and os calcis. 3. Between the os calcis,and the os cuboides.. . 4. Between the inner cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe.. 5. Between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and between these and the-adjoining bones (the great toe excepted). 6. Between the os cuboides and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The joints formed between the distal ends of the metatarsal bones and the phalanges of the toes, and the several inter- phalangeal joints, are connected in all respects like those of the fingers.

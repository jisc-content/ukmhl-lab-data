DIAPHRAGM. 395 The outer border of the kidney is convex, the inner concave, and presents a notch, the hilus, for the entrance of the vessels and duct, which have the following relations:â€”anteriorly is the renal vein, posteriorly is the ureter, the renal artery being between them. The kidneys and supra-renal capsules naust be removed and reserved for further examination. The semilunar ganglia, two in number, are situated one on each side of the coeliac axis, in the neighbourhood of the supra-renal bodies; that on the right side will be found lying under the vena cava inferior. Their filaments Fio. 84. Dissection. Semilunar Ganglia. 1. Aorta passing be- tween the crura. 2. Opening for oeso- pli.'igrus. 3. Opening for vena cava. 4. Quadratus lum- borum. 5. Psoas magnua. The dark arches above the quad- ratus and psoas are the ' arcu- ate ligaments.' DiAPHEAGM.

Above, each ganglion receives the great splanchnic nerve (p. 147). This is a partly muscular and partly tendinous arch, so constructed as to form a complete movable partition between the chest and the abdomen ; a floor for the one, and a roof for the other. Its upper or thoracic surface is convex ; its lower or abdominal, concave. On removing its peritoneal covering, we observe a broad tendon in the centre, and that muscular fibres converge to it from all sides (fig. 84). The dia- phragm arises, 1. From the ensiform cartilage; 2. From the inner

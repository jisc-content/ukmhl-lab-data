Immediately below the junction, the large intestine is expanded into a blind pouch, called the caecum or caput coli. Into the back part of this pouch opens a little tube closed at. the other end, called the appendix vermiformis. This tube is gene- rally three inches long, about as thick as a large earthworm, and Fig. 75. 1. Deum. 2. Cascum or caput coli. 3. Appendix vermi- formis. SECTION THHOUGH THE JUNCTION OF THE LARGE AND SMALL INTESTINE TO SHOW THE ILIO-C^CAL VALVE AND APPENDIX VERMIFOfiMIS, is either coiled up behind the csecum, or connected to it by a peritoneal fold, so as to hang, loose in the pelvis. The commence ment of the large intestine is generally confined by the peri- toneum to the iliac fossa, in which it dies.* Tracing it from this point, it ascends through the right lumbar region in front of the right kidney as high as the under surface of the liver, where it * But this is not invariably so. The-bowel is, .in some subjects, connected to the fossa by a fold of peritoneum or a meso-ccBcum. 1 have seen this fold sufficiently loose to allow the caput coli to travel over to the left iliac fossa.

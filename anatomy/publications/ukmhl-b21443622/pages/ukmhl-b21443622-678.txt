DISSECTION OF THE OEGAN OF HEARING. G60 outwards by a thick membrane, the basilar membrane (fig. 168) ; thus dividing the tube into an upper canal, the scala vestibuli, and a lower, the scala tympani. The upper scale is subdivided by an oblique membrane-—membrane of Reissner—into two canals, an inner, the scala vestibuli, and an outer, the d/actus cochlearis. The ductus cochlearis or scala media terminates at the helicotrema in a cul-de-sac; inferiorly it is connected with the cavity of the saccule by a long, narrow duct, called the canalis reuniens. On examining the membranous continuation of the lamina spiralis, it is seen, not far from its attachment to the osseous zone, Fig. 168. DIAGEAMMATIC SECTION OF A COII. OF THE COCHLEA.

The structure of the limbus consists of firm connective tissue, on the under part of which are found numerous cells. The basilar membrane forms, at the base of the cochlea, but a small breadth of the septum, the broadest part being formed of bone, but it gradually increases in breadth towards the cupola, where it constitutes nearly the entire septum.

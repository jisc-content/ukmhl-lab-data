The papillce fungiformce, smaller and more numerous than the circumvallatce, are scattered chiefly over the sides and tip of the tongue, and sparingly over its upper Fig. 39. siurface. They vary in shape, some being cylindrical, others having rounded heads like mushrooms; whence their name. Near the apex of the tongue they may be distin- guished during life from the other papillse by their redder colour. In scarlatina, and some exanthematous fevers, these papillse become elongated, and of a bright red colour: as the fever subsides, their points acquire a brownish tint; giving rise to what is called the strawberry tongue. The papillcB filiformoB are the smallest and most numerous. They are so closely aggregated that they give the tongue a velvet-like appearance. Their points are directed backwards, so that the tongue feels smooth if the finger be passed over it from apex to base, but rough if in the contrary direction. These papillae consist of small conical processes arranged for the most part in a series of lines running parallel to the two rows of the papillae circumvallatse. Each papilla is covered with a thick layer of epithelium, which is prolonged into a number of free hairlike processes. If the papillse be injected, and examined under the microscope, it is found that they are not simple elevations, like those of the skin, but that from them arise secondary papillse. The papillse circumvallatse consist of an aggregation of smaller papillse arranged parallel to each other; and the papillas fungiformse consist of cen- tral stems from which minute secondary papillse shoot off.

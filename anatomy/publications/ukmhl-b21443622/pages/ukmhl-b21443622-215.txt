DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 197 M. Crico- This muscle is situated on the front of the THTKoiDKus. laiyux. It arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage, ascends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the inferior border and lower cornu of the thyroid. Its action is to tigthen the vocal cords. It does this by depressing the thyroid cartilage: since this cartilage cannot be depressed without length- ening these cords, as shown by the dotted line, fig. 36. Its nerve is the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal. Be- tween the anterior borders of the two muscles is seen the crico- thyroid membrane, which is divided in Laryngotomy. Fig. 36.

Ceico- This muscle arises from the posterior part of AHTTENoiDEus thc cricoid cartilage: its fibres converge and Posticus. p^^gg outwards and upwards, to be inserted into the outer angle of the arytenoid. Its action is to dilate the glottis. It does this by drawing the posterior tubercle of the arytenoid cartilage towards the mesial line, and therefore the anterior angle (to which the vocal cord is attached) from the mesial line (fig. 37). In this movement the arytenoid cartilage rotates as upon a pivot, and acts as a lever of the first order ; the fulcrum or ideal pivot being intermediate between the power

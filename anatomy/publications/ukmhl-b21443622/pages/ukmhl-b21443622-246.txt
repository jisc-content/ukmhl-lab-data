CARTILAGES OF THE NOSE. 228 cavernous sinus, and the nervous plexuses upon it are described at p. 16. In tlie carotid Ccanal the artery gives off a small }>ranch to the mastoid cells and the tympanum. At this stage of the dissection we may conveniently trace the anterior divisions of the two upper cervicdl nerves. SuBoccrpiTAL The anterior division of the first cei^ical or ^J^^"^^- suboccipital nerve descends in front of the trans- verse process of the atlas to form a loop with the second cervical nerve. It lies beneath the vertebral artery, on the inner side of the rectus capitis lateralis to which it gives a branch; and from its loop of communication with the second nerve, it gives branches to the recti antici muscles. This nerve is connected by filaments with the superior cervical gauglion of the sympathetic, with the hypoglossal and .the pneumogastric nerves. Second Cervi- The anterior division of this nerve-emerges be- CAL Nerve, tween the arches of the atlas and axis, and passes between the vertebral artery and the intertransverse muscle, in front of which it sub-divides into an ascending branch which joins the first cervical nerve, and a descending, which joins the third cervical-nerve. IDISSECTION OP THE NOSE. Presuming that the dissector is familiar with the bones-com- posing the skeleton of the nose, we shall now describe, 1. The nasal cartilages; 2. The general figure and arrangement of the nasal cavities; 3. The membrane which lines them ; and, 4. The distribution of the olfactory nerves. Cartilages of The framework of the external nose is formed, TitE Nose. qu each side, by two lateral cartilages; and by one in the centre, which completes the septum between the nasal f0SSÂ£B. The lateral cartilages are termed, respectively, upper and lower. The upper, triangular in shape, is connected, superiorly, to

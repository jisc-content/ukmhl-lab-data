DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 590 Tlie fissure of Sylvius is seen on the base of the cerebrum, and receives the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It curves outwards as a deep cleft, and divides into two rami; an as- cending or vertical, about an inch in length, and a posterior or horizontal ramus, which passes backwards, and ends about the middle of the hemisphere. iiG. 143.

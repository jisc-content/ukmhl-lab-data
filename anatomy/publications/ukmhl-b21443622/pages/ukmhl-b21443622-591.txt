573 LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. malleolus on this side (fig. 134). The great strength of it is proved by the fact that, in dislocations of the ankle inwards, the summit of the malleolus is more often broken oflf than the ligament torn. It extends from a deep excavation at the apex of the malleolus, radiates from this point, and is attached to the side of the astragalus, also to the os calcis, to the scaphoid bone, and to the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which it firmly braces up (fig. 134). This ligament consists of three distinct fasciculi â€”an anterior, a posterior, and a middle (fig. 135). All three arise from surfaces near the summit of Fio. 134. External Lateral, Ligament. 1.

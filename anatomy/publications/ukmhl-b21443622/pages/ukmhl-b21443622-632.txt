This process presents three eminences, an anterior, middle, and posterior, which are named respectively, the lohulus centralis, the monticulus cere- belli, and the commissura simplex. The hemispheres are sepa- rated posteriorly by a deep notch, the incisura cerebelli jjosterior, which receives the falx cerebelli. On this surface of the cerebel- lum are two lobes, one of which, the quadrate, is situated on its Fig. 152. SUPEEIOB SURFACE OF THE CEREBEIXUM. t c s. Inoisura cerebelli anterior. icp.

On'the under surface of the cerebellum, its Undee Sue- face division into two hemispheres is clearly per- ceptible. The deep furrow between them is called the vallecula. The front part of it is occupied by the medulla oblongata. To examine the surface of the valley the medulla must be raised, and the hemispheres separated from each other. Along the middle line of the vallecula is the inferior veimiform process,

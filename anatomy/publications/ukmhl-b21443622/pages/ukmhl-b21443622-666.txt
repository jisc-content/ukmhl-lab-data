648 DISSECTION OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. The parts constituting the organ of hearing should be examined in the following order:—1. The outer cartilage or pinna ; 2. The naeatus auditorius externus ; which leads to 3. The tympanum or middle ear ; and 4. The labyrinth or internal ear, comprising the vestibule, cochlea, and semi-circular canals, p^^^^ The pinna or auricle is irregularly oval, and presents on its external aspect niunorous eminences and hollows, which have received the following names :—The cir- cumferential folded border is called the helix; the ridge within it, the antihelix ; between these is a curved groove, called the fossa of the helix. The antihelix bifurcates towards the front, and encloses the fossa of the antihelix. The conical eminence in front of the meatus is termed the tragus^ on which some hairs are usually found. Behind the tragus, and separated from it by a deep notch {incisura intertragica), is the antitragus. The lobule is the soft pendulous part, and consists of fat and fibrous tissue. The deep hollow, which collects the vibrations of sound, and con- veys them into the external meatus, is termed the concha. The pinna is composed of yellow fibro-cartilage, with a little fat and cellular tissue. It is attached by an anterior ligament to the root of the zygoma, and by sl posterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. When the skin of the pinna is removed, we find that the cartilage has a tubular prolongation inwards, which forms the external part of the meatus auditorius. It does not, however, form any part of the lobule, and is incomplete behind the tragus, the deficiency being filled up with fibrous tissue. The cartilage further presents several fissures {fissures of Santorini) at the anterior part of the tubular prolongation, which are completed by firm fibrous tissue.

339 STERNO-CLAVICULAK JOINT. the clavicles it is more or less attached to the sternum, so that it forms a curve with the concavity upwards. The three ligaments just described are so closely connected that, collectively, they form for the joint a complete fibrous capsule of such strength that dislocation of it is rare. The costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament connects the cla- vicle to the cartilage of the first rib. It ascends obliquely out- wards and backwards from the cartilage of the rib to a rough sur- face beneath the sternal end of the clavicle. Its use is to limit the elevation of the clavicle. There is such constant movement between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib that a well- marked bursa is commonly found between them. Fig. 64. DIAGEAM OF THE STEHNO-CLAYICtTLAR LIGAMENTS. 1. Inter-clavicular ligament. 3. Costo-claviciilar ligament. 2. Anterior sterno-clavicular ligament. 4. Inter-articolar fibro-cartilage. Inter-articular fibro-cartilage.â€”To see this, cut through the rhomboid, the anterior and posterior ligaments of the joint, and raise the clavicle. It is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the circumference than the centre, in which there is sometimes a perforation. Inferiorly, it is attached to the cartilage of the first rib, close to the sternum; superiorly, to the upper part of the clavicle and the inter-clavicular ligament. Its circumference is inseparably connected with the anterior and posterior ligaments. The joint is provided with two synovial membranes: one between the articular surface of the sternum and the inner surface z 2

352 JOINTS OF THE FINGEES. The palmar' ligament is a thick, compact, fibrous struc- ture, which extends over the palmar surface of the joint. Its lower end is firmly attached to the base of the first phalanx of the finger; its upper end is loosely adherent to the rough surface above the head of the metacarpal bone. On either side it is in- separably connected with the lateral ligaments, so that with them it forms a strong capsule over the front and sides of the joint. Its superficial surface is slightly grooved, for the play of the flexor tendons; its deep surface is adapted to cover the head of the meta- carpal bone. Two sesamoid bones are found in the palmar liga- ment belonging to the joint between the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb. The palmar ligaments have a surgical importance for the follow- ing reason :â€”In dislocation of the fingers, the facility of reduction mainly depends upon the extent to which the glenoid ligament is injured. If it be much torn there is but little diflSculty: if entire, the reduction may require much manipulation. These joints are secured on their dorsal aspect by the extensor tendon, and the expansion proceeding from it on either side. Their synovial membranes are loose, especially beneath the extensor tendons. Second and corresponding articular surfaces of the Last Joint of phalanges of the fingers and thumb are so shaped THE FiNQEEs. jjs to form a hinge-joint, and, therefore, in- capable of lateral movement. The ligaments connecting them are similar in every respect to those between the metacarpal bones and the first phalanges. The palmar ligament of the last joint of the thumb generally contains a sesamoid bone.

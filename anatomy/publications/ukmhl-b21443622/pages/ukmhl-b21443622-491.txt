PELVIC VISCERA IN THE FEMALE. 473 attached to the fundus or the side of the uterus. But everyone knows the danger of what is called placenta prcevia. Here, the placenta, placed entirely or partly over the orifice of the uterus, is attached to a part of the organ which must of necessity expand during labour; and every uterine contraction increases, instead of checking, the bleeding. For the same reason, paralysis of the muscular fibres in immediate connection with the placenta, be it where it may, is likely to be a source of serious hgemorrhage in parturition. The Fallopian tubes or oviducts are situated, one on each side, along the upper border of the Fig. 106. Fallopian Tubes. DIAGEAM OF THE UTEKTJS, ITS BEOAD LIGAMENTS, THE OVAEIES AND FALLOPIAN TOTES.

One end opens into the uterus; the other terminates in a wide funnel-shaped mouth, surrounded by fringe-like processes called the fimbriated extremity. This termination of the Fal- lopian tube extends about an inch beyond the ovary ; and, by float- ing it in water, one or two of the fimbriae may be seen connected with the outer end of the ovary. If the Fallopian tube be opened from the expanded end, and a probe introduced into it, you will

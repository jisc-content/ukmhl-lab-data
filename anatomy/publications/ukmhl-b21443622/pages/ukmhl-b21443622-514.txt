496 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The body having- been placed on its back, the thigh should be slightly flexed and abducted. An incision should be made along the groin, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubes; another, from the middle of the first, down the thigh for about six inches. The skin being reflected, the superficial fascia and vessels will be exposed. SuPEEFiciAL This fascia varies in thickness, according to Pascia. the condition of the body. Like other superficial fascias, it is divisible into two layers, between which are situated the inguinal glands, and the cutaneous vessels. The upper layer is continuous with that of the abdomen ; the deeper layer is best marked in the upper part of the thigh, especially where it stretches across the saphenous opening to form the cnbHform fascia, and is attached to Poupart's ligament. The cutaneous vessels come from the femoral artery and are three in number, the superficial efigastric, the superficial ex- ternal pudic, and the superficial circumflexa ilii arteries : the first ascends over Poupart's ligament to the abdomen (p. 355); the second crosses inwards towards the pubes ; and the third passes outwards to the ilium. Each artery is accompanied by one, sometimes by two veins, which empty themselves, either directly into the femoral, or into the great cutaneous vein of the thigh, called the saphena. Superficial These glands are easily recognised, by their Inguinal oval form and reddish-brown colour. There are Glands. two sets: one set runs parallel to Poupart's liga- ment, and receives the lymphatics from the penis, the scrotum, the perineum, the anus, the buttock, the lower part of the ab-

DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 615 which is the under surface of the fundamental part of the cere- bellum. Traced forwards, this process terminates in the nodule; traced backwards, it ends in a small conical projection, called the jpyramid; between these is a tongue-like body, called the uvula. Each hemisphere presents on its under surface certain secondary lobes, to which diflferent names have been applied (fig. 153). That portion which immediately overlies the side of the vallecula is called the tonsil {amygdala); this is connected with the uvula by an indented layer of grey matter, called the furrowed Fig. 153.

From either side of the uvula may be traced a thin valve-like fold of white substance, which proceeds in a semicircular direc- tion to the flocculi. These folds form the posterior medullary velum.* To see this satisfactorily, the tonsils must be carefully separated from each other. * These are sometimes called the valves of Tarini.

578 rnissECTiON of the brain. Membranes of PREVIOUS to the examination of the brain itself, THE Brain. "we should sttidy the structure and uses of the three membranes by which it is surrounded. The 'first, the dura mater, has been described (p. 6). The second is a serous membrane, termed the arabhnoid ; the third is a vascular one, termed the pia mater. Aeacbngid This second investment forms 'the smooth, Mbmbhane. polished surface of the brain, exposed after the removal of the dura mater. It is named'araishnoid, from the resemblance (if'its-texture to a spider's web. It is^a serous mem- brane, and, like all others-of the kind, forms a-closed sac, one part of which, the parietal layer, lines 'the under surface of the dura mater; the other, the visceral, is reflected over the brain. The opposed surfaces of this ' membrane are polished, and lubricated by a serous fluid which " diminishes friction ; since the brain is moved with a slight pulsation, caused-in part by the action of the heart, in part by respiration. The parrietal la,jev is so' thin that it can be demonstrated as a distinct layer only in a few places; it consists of little more than a layer of squamous epithelium, lining the inner aspect of the dura mater. The visceral layer is colourless and transparent; it is spread uniformly over the surface of the brain, and does not dip into the furrows between the convolutions. On account of its extreme tenuity, and its close adhesion to the pia mater, it cannot be readily separated from this membrane; but there are places, especially at the base of the brain,? termed ^ subarachnoid spaces, where the arachnoid membrane can he seen distinct i from the subjacent pia mater.

LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 250 rotation of the head. A third or middle odontoid ligament passes from the apex of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum. It is sometimes called the ligamentum sua- pensorium. The odontoid process of the axis forms a pivot upon which the head and atlas rotate. The most important ligament is the transverse (fig. 48). It passes behind the odontoid process, and is attached to the tubercles on the inner sides of the articular processes of the Abticulation between the Atlas and the Axis. Fig. 48. POST?

From the centre of this ligament a few fibres pass upwards, to be attached to the basilar process, and some downwards to the body of the axis, giving- it a cruciform appearance. Thus it forms with the atlas a ring, into which the odontoid process is received. If this transverse ligament be divided, we observe that the odon- toid process is covered with cartilage in front and behind, and is provided with two synovial membranes. The anterior arch of the atlas is connected to the body of the axis by the anterior atlanto-axoid ligament; posteriorly, the two arches are connected by the posterior atlanto-axoid ligament.

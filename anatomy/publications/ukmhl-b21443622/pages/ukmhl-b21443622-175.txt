157 DISSECTION OF THE HEART. Tlie posterior wall of the auricle is formed by the partition between the auricles, the ' septum auricularum.'' Upon this septum, above and to the left of the orifice of the vena cava inferior, is an oval depression [fossa ovalis), bounded by a pro- minent border (annulus ovalis). This depression indicates the remains of the opening (foramen ovale) through which the auricles communicated in foetal life. After birth this opening closes; but if the closure is imperfect, the stream of dark blood in the right auricle mixes with the florid blood in the left, and occasions what is called ' cyanosis.^ A valvular communica- FiG. 29.

A more or less noticeable fold of the lining membrane may be seen projecting from the front margin of the v. c. inferior to the front border of the fossa ovalis. It is the remnant of the ' Eustachian* valve; which was of considerable size in fcetal life, and served to direct the current of blood from the v. c. inferior', through the foramen ovale, into the left auricle. * Eustachiu.s, 'Libell. de rena sine pari.'

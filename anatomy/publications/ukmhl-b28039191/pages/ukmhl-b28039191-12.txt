VI which depend upon a sacrifice of reason to faith ; hence it is that philosophers have been too much upbraided with the crime, as it is called, of unbelief, when in fact they are better acquainted with the works of their Creator, and more impressed with the certainty of His infinite wisdom, mercy, and benevolence, than any other set of men. To you, my good Sir, we are deeply indebted for weaving into the texture of Anatomical Studies, opinions deduced from facts, which cannot fail to give to the minds of your Pupils a dis- position to recollect their Creator, and to adore his benevolence, in the course of those studies, which are to make them able to be themselves benefactors of their species. You are, as far as I know, the first Anatomist who has introduced into his Lectures any considerable notices of the wisdom of God in his works of creation; may your example be followed, and thus may the minds of our youth be framed in a better disposition, and rendered more useful to their neighbours as well as to themselves, than has been the case with the generation now making their exit from the regions we have been, and are yet permitted to enjoy. I beg, my Dear Sir, you will believe me. Your obliged and faithful Humble Servant, JOSEPH BANKS. 1

COPY OF A LETTER FROM THE RIGHT HON. SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BARONET AND K. B. PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY, &c. &c. &c.* TO DR. RAMSAY. Soho Square, Jan. 29, 1813. MY DEAR SIR, I RETURN you my best thanks for your obliging present of the valuable second edition of your Anatomy of the Heart and Brain: I have perused it with much pleasure, and I give you abundant credit for your most laudable attempts to destroy the baneful system of materialism, and to explain the hitherto incomprehensible mixture of mortality and immortality of which we are composed. How it can have happened that an extended knowledge of any kind could have led to infidelity, is to me wholly unintelli- gible : every investigation of nature, and even of art, must lead to a conviction of the certainty of the existence of a Power capable not only of creating, but of causing created beings to continue their species. Religious men are always terrified at the idea of laymen having any superior knowledge, lest they should use it in calling in question those parts of every religion * The Gentlemen who have honoured the Author’s Prospectus with their names, as promoters of his System of Anatomy, deeming the publication of the Letter of Sir Joseph Banks, of the highest consequence to its moral influence with the world—this object alone could have induced the Author making the request; and this circumstance only has pre- vailed with Sir Joseph Banks to permit its appearance, as it dropped from his pen in confidence. Thus, this illustrious personage, has given the world an additional proof of his relinquishing his own inclinations, where the good of others is concerned.

SEVENTH STAGE OF THE DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 45 PLATE XI. The inverted The inverted fornix (d) exhibits the transverse lines (g) distin- Formx, Velum its lower surface, deriving the name of Psalterium or Interpositum, o o ^ ^ kc. in situ. Lyra, from its supposed resemblance to the stringed instrument of the ancients. The velum interpositum (i) is'discovered by this section, formed of a duplicature of the pia-mater derived from the adjacent lower surface of the posterior lobe,of the cerebrum and the superior cone of the cerebellum. . This composes at once the envelope of the vessels of the velum, and the pia mater which covers the ventricles. The arteries of the plexus (Plate XV. Fig. 2d, II) are continued from the middle and posterior cerebral ar- teries, (d p). The vena galeni (k) terminate in one common trunk, to be inserted into the torcular herophili (c), represented likewise in its profile (Plate XIII. Fig. 2d, e), receiving the vena galeni (i) into its cavity. The right posterior lobe of the cerebrum (o) is removed, to bring the cone (p) of the tentorium, on which it rested, into view. This rises nearly an inch and a half into the sphere of the cranium, where a wound inflicted would pene- trate the cerebrum and cerebellum. The velum may be removed from its anterior adhesions to the ventricles, as represented in the next Plate, X. This requires to be cautiously performed, as the third ventricle, (Plate XI. Fig. 1st, x) is apt to be thrown aukwardly open if the velum is rudely elevated, and the pineal gland (Plate X. Fig. 1st and 2d, e) is liable to be torn from its situation if this care is not observed; as numerous vessels pass from the velum into its substance, which form a more powerful adhesion to the velum than its peduncles do to the adjacent bodies, with which we shall find it con- nected.

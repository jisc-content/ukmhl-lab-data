18 OFFICES OF THE BONES OF THE CRANIUM. Fig. 1st, t). Externally the ossa parietalia are smooth on their superior surface ; they rise into a bump in the middle, where a white segment receives*the temporal muscle, beneath which it is radiated, in consequence of the direction of the fibres of its tempo- ral muscle, which is inserted into the superior region of the lower jaw (Plate III. Fig. 1st. 14). Mhiy,The Ossa These bones form the lower region of the temples (Plate HE lamporum. p-g, gQ, 21,) and the lateral oblique basilary portions of the cranium (Plate XIII. Fig. 3d, r.—Plate III. Fig. 1, 18, 19, 20,21,—Fig. 2d, d, r, v, u, x, y). These bones may be said to be composed of five principal parts, viz. the pars squamosa (Plate III. Fig. 1st, 19, 20, 21, 22); 2dly, its zygoma (18) ; 3dly, the pars petrosa (PlateIII. Fig. 2d, v, x u, Plate XIII. Fig. 3d, r) ; 4thly, its mastoid process (Fig. 1st, 8) ; and, 5th, its styloid pro- cess (Plate III. Fig. 1st, s). We have seen its connections with the frontal and parietal bones ; its mastoid process joins the lower termination of the os occipitis; its os petrosum is seen (Plate XIII. Fig. 3d. r,) situate between the sphenoidal and occipital bones. The foramina will be mentioned afterwards: (1) is the meatus auditorius externus; (m) the zygoma; (tt) the recipient of the lower jaw ; the tentorium and superior petrous sinus (Plate XIII. Fig. 2d, g) is received on the ridge (Pfote III. Fig. 2d, v) the segment (Plate III. Fig. 2d, u) lodges the termination of the lateral sinus (Plate XIV. Fig. 1st, u); the pars squamosa (Plate III. Fig. 2d, r d) and superior surface of the pars petrosa (v), sustain the posterior portion of the middle cerebral lobes (Plate XV. s, u); the inferior portions of the pars petrosa sustain the lateral portions of the pons varolii (Plate XV. n, o); and the posterior angle (u) sustains part of the cerebellic lobe (Plate XV. §). 6thiy, The Os (Plate III. Fig. 1st and 2d, h) is somewhat oval, internally con- Occipitis. cave, convex externally. This bone forms the occiput (Plate III. Fig. 1st h), and basis of the cranium (Plate XIII. Fig.3d, h p). It ’ The tentorium in its base arises from the lateral fossae of the os occipitis (Plate III, Fig,2d *)j the sinus of the posterior angle of the os parietale (t), and is continued along the ridge (v)

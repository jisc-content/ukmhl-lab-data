SECOND STAGE OF THE DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 31 The Calvaria. The Dura Mater. PLATE V. This plate represents the calvaria in their internal appearance; the sutures are observed to be nearly linear internally; the ine« qualities mentioned (h), which correspond to the brain, are re- presented, which are very frequent in the ossa parietalia and os frontis. The arterial sulci are often very deep, as here shewn at (i). PLATE VI. This membrane in its external lamina is here exhibited. The lacerations of the coronal suture (d), sagittal (e), and lambdoidal suture (f), point out the regions of those bones. The inequalities (h) are evident, as likewise in the frontis. The dura mater assumes a bluish tint externally. Its surface is completely villous, arising from the congeries of vessels passing from this membrane into the substance of the inner tables anil cancelli, as their vasa propria or nutritia. These anastomose with the frontal, temporal, and occipital arteries, Plate III. Fig. 1st. In young subjects, these vessels are so numerous and powerful, that the bones are raised by the operator with great diffi- culty ; on the contrary, in,old subjects, where the vessels are few, and comparatively feeble, the bones are elevated with e^se. The longitudinal sinus (n n) is seen in great part of its extent which was connected with the spine or groove of the os frontis, (Plate III. Fig. 2d, 0), the hollows of the ossa parietalia (f), and the superior sinus (k), of the os occipitis. The dura mater has no openings externally in this sinus, except at the su- perior (n, Plate IV. and V.), where the veins of the cranial inte- guments occasionally enter the sinus, and where the sinus may occasionally empty its contents into these veins.’ * Plate IV and V. (g) the venous orifices which communicate with the sinus are re- presented ; they convey the blood from the integuments. These venous openings are not always present; if present, would a section of them, in apoplectic cases, become

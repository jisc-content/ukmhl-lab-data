INTRODUCTION. 4 I trust, that, with preparations before the student, thrown into the attitudes here attempted, he cannot fail to comprehend their anatomy. As few artists can adhere so strictly to those minutiae on which anatomical works become chiefly valuable, the figures are not on- ly drawn from nature by my own hand, but I have likewise etch- ed them myself, under the superintendence of Mr Robert Scott, engraver. Parliament Square, Edinburgh. If this edition is improved as engravings, I have to acknowledge the dexterous and delicate hand of that gentleman, as the cause of the finished appearance they now assume, which I presume is suffi- ciently elegant for anatomical purposes. I must injustice to Mr Scott observe, that such deficiencies as may appear in the work, as plates, derive this from the imperfection of my etching.

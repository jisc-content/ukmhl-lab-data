INTRODUCTION. Plan of the Work, The rapid sale of the first edition of this Work, and the. ap- probation with which it has been received, encourages me to pre- sent the public with a second impression. The plan followed in this Treatise, I originally adopted in my lectures in Surgeonâ€™s Square, Edinburgh; and since that period, I have extensively prosecuted it in the Colleges of New York, Dartmouth, and Brunswick. In these American se- minaries I successively taught, by invitation, when I visited that Continent, with a view of investigating the human frame, under the varieties of climate, government, and police. In this volume are brought into view the parts composing the Brain, and their relative connection with each other, as well as remote organs more immediately connected with it, so indis- pensable to the practitioner. By this means the anatomy, phy- siology, and practical ideas, of each department of the system> will be brought before the physician or surgeon in one connected scheme. The next volume will display the minutiae of the compo- nent parts of the Head and Neck, for the improvement of the Stu- dent. This method will be observed in the prosecution of the work, that it may answer the purposes of a guide to the practical anatomist, and in some degree a substitute for dissection. As we proceed, directions will be given in notes, not only respecting the steps to be taken in the course of dissection of the human body, but like- wise for preserving the various parts in a moist and dry state.

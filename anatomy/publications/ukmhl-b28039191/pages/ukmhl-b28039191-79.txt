65 Conclusion. CONCLUSION. Youth, naturally generous, yet uncontaminated by the cares, the wants, and folly of life, will, I trust, accept these labours as a mark of my solicitude for their success in a profession of the most responsible nature. From a deficiency in accurate ana- tomy, the fruits of an honourable and attentive life in other re- spects, in the physician or surgeon, may be blasted in one un- foreseen occurrence; of which I have witnessed numerous in- stances. I have thought it my duty, as an anatomist, to offer such notions as seem to place life and matter, the work and gift of God, as well as immortal being, in what has appeared to me their true and connected light; as the notions on these subjects which have be- come too prevalent, seem equally erroneous, and dangerous to ci- vilized life.

If, in investigating a subject so complicated, I have inadvertent- ly expressed myself in terms which may be explained to a different purpose by the advocates of the doctrines which I deprecate, I still must indulge the hope, that, from the general scope of the facts which I have detailed, and the conclusions which I have drawn from these, my meaning can scarcely be mistaken. And, if I have failed to impress the mind of the reader of these pages with the peculiar ideas which have occurred to me on the subject, I yet trust, that no one who seriously investigates the structure and economy of a frame so fearfully and wonderfully made,”—since he must be convinced that an animal body is a parts may be wounded, when a ball has entered the substance of the brain; the first portions afl'ected may, however, be correctly ascertained, and if the exit of bodies are marked, even the contents injured may be nearly determined.

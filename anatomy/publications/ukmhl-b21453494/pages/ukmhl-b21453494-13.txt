11 in his hands, than as a hazardous and desperate tamper- ing with the Hfe of his fellow-creature ? Indeed, the necessity of anatomical knowledge to the surgeon is so plain, that it is sufficient only to know what surgery and anatomy mean, to see that they are m- separably linked together, and that a man might as well talk of running a race and winning it, whose limbs were struck, with palsy, as of going a single step into a sound knowledge of surgery, without a previous practical ac- quaintance with anatomy. I say practical acquaintancei for there is no error more fatal to the progress of that science, nor more calculated to satisfy the minds of students with a worse than im- perfect knowledge of this ground-work of the healing art, than the notion that anatomy may be learned by an exercise of the sense of sight alone; or in other words, by viewing the dissections made by others, attending public demonstrations in theatres and colleges, reading books, and looking at plates and imitations of the body in wax and plaster. These are all useful as auxiliaries, but they are quite insufficient to convey that practical know- ledge of the structure of the body, which the surgeon in particular requires. The exercise of several of the senses, and above all of that of touch, is absolutely necessary to the knowledge of what has been termed surgical or re- lative anatomy. The student must bring into view the parts of the dead body which he is studying, with the very hand which is afterwards to divide and separate them

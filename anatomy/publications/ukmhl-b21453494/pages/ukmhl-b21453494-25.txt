23 plied at a reasonable rate, without having longer to en- counter the perplexities, dangers, and insufficiencies, under which they have laboured for so great a length of time. Before proceeding to explain the only public measure which appears capable of answering this important ob- ject, it may be proper to state, in a general way, the number of dead bodies which would be annually re- quired for the practical teaching of anatomy, in Great Britain and Ireland. I shall supppse the period of study to be three years, and that in each of these years, a careful dissection is to be made of all the most important parts of the body. This will .require one dead body for the muscles, a second for the blood-vessels, and a third for the nerves. The viscera may be studied partly in one, and partly in the other two of these three dead bodies. Now, in the^ourse_ of three years, two students will requirejnned^d bodies, to which we shall add a tenth for the repetition of the prin- cipal surgical operations. Such I consider as the most moderate computation which ought to be admitted; al- though it cannot be denied, that comparatively few surgeons of the present day, have enjoyed opportu- nities of carrying their anatomical studies even to the length here proposed. Double the number of dpad bodies I have here stated would, I think, be little enouo-h for the acquirement even of a moderate knowledrre of anatomy; but, at least, evidence of the student's having

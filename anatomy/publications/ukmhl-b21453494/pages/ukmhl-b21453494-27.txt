S5 houses, foiindling-houses, houses of correction and pri- sons, find any difficulty in furnishing the number of dead bodies required; and that without any extraordinary sa- crifice of feeUng on the part of the friends and relatives of the deceased. The annual number required, according , to our calculation, is in London, 766; in Edinburgh, 383; in Dublin, 383; and in Glasgow, 191. Now, granting that Edinburgh and Glasgow could with difficulty sup- ply their respective numbers, they could be furnished from Dublin and London, or even from either of these towns alone.* There is no reason to suppose that the number j)f dead bodies appropriated Jo j,na.tpmical pur- poses in Great Britain and Irelandj Jias ever ampj^ Jo_300..ann.ually. How easily could this small number be supplied ! How much good could be effected even by this small provision, furnished with regularity ! As the dead bodies for anatomical purposes can be derived in sufficient numbers only from public institu- tions, it is necessary that the schools of anatomy be in large towns; yet these schools should be in some mea- sure removed from public view, and ought never to be suffered within the walls of an hospital. Where life has come to seek for preservation, the neighbourhood of corrupting corpses must ever be highly offensive, both morally and physically prejudicial to the recovery of the sick, and hurtful to the usefulness of charitable institu- tions. The greatest decency, and even a certain secresy â€¢ The annual mortality of London, is about 30,000. D

It is the Intention of the Writer, in the following Compendium, to prefent to the Student, a ufeful Anatomical Confpedlus, or Pocket Manual of Ana- tomy, giving a fhort, but accurate Defeription of the different parts of the Human Body ; with a Gloflary or Explanation of the principal Terms ufed in that fcience. The utility of fuch a performance will be generally acknowledged, efpecially when we confider, that there is no fuch work written upon a fimilar plan. The Author has divided the Anatomy of the Hu- man Body into nine parts. 1. In the OJleology will be found the principal dl- vifions, eminences, cavities, &c. &c. of all the bones, with their fynonima. 2. The Syndefmohgy is fliort, but conveys a very clear idea of the connections of bones by their means. 3. The DoBrine of the Mvfcles is condudted after the much-approved plan of Innis. The mode of name—origin—infertion — and ufe—in one concen- trated view, the author hopes, will convey a perfedt , l^nowledge of their fituatlons and fundtions. 4- The Burfahgy is introduced in a compendious ; form, as deferving the attentbn of the Student. 5. The[ vlil 1 5. The Ajiglology exhibits an explicit defcription of the different arteries, veins and abforbents. 6. The Neurology is divided, in fome refpe£ls, dif- ferent from the generality of writers on this fubjeft. The DoBrine of the Glands is fhort. 8. The Splanchnology contains all the moft ufeful information on that head, reduced into a very fmall Ipace. And, 9. T\it Hygrohgy gives the definitions, nature, and life of all the fluid parts of the body, as confidered In the doftrine of the fluids. The motives that Induced the Author to form and collect together, in one fmall pocket volume, this elementary produ6lion, to which he has added thofe technical Terms and greek Derivatives, that occur moft frequently in Anatomy, were, his having himfelf ex- perienced the want of fuch an afliftant, when applying to that branch of Philofophy. He, therefore, folicits permiffion to recommend it to Students, not as 3 work, wherein any thing new is to be met with, but merely as their occafional companion, in the profecu- tion of their ftudies.

It is divided into Olteology, Syndefmology, Myology, Burfalogy, Angiology, Neurology, Adenology, Splanchnology, Hygrology, J or doilrine of the rBones. Ligaments. Mufcles. Burfae Mucofe. Veffels. Nerves. Glands. Vifeera. Fluids. The human body, during life, Is compofed of folids, fluids, and a vital principle. Anatomy confiders the folids and fluids, but the vital principle and its effefts belong to Phyfiology. OSTEOLOGY. 'Definition. Bones are the hardeft, dryeft, and moft; infenfible parts of the body. Subfiance, compact— fpongy—reticular. Colour, whitiflh. Figure, vari- ous. Dhnfiion.

LIGA'[ 33 ] ItGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. ‘The proper ligaments which conneft the fcaptila with the potterior extremity of the clavicle are—the conoid—and trapezoid ligaments. LIGAMENTS OF THE HUMERUS. The head of the humerus is connected with the glenoid cavity of the fcapula by the capfular liga- ment. LIGAMENTS OF TltE ARTICULATION OF THE CUBIT. The articulation of the cubit Is formed by the In- ferior extremity of the humerus, and fuperior extre- mities of the ulna and radius. The ligaments con- neftlng thefe bones are—the capfular—brachlo-cubi- tal—and brachlo-radlal ligaments. LIGAMENTS OF THE RADIUS. The radius is affixed to the humerus, cubit, and carpus, by peculiar ligaments, namely, the fuperior— inferior—oblique—and interoffeous ligaments. LIGAMENTS OF THE CARPUS. The ligaments which conne£l the eight bones of the carpus together, and with the fore-arm and me- tacarpus, are—the capfular ligament of the carpus— firft and fecond tranfverfe ligament—oblique Uga- tnent—and the capfular ligament proper to the bones <)f the carpus. D LlG A-[ 34 ] Ligaments of the METACAKPuy. The bones of the metacarpus are in part conned^ed' with the fecond order of bones, and in part together, by the articular—and interoffeous ligaments. XIGAMENTS OF THE FINGERS. * The fingers and phalanges are connedled together, and with the metacarpus ; and the pollex with the carpus, by the lateral ligaments of the fingers—and ligament of the pollex with the os trapezium of the carpus. riGAMENTS WHICH KEEP THE TENDONS OF THE ' MUSCLES OF THE HAND IN THEIR PROPER PLACE. The ligaments which keep the tendons of the muf- cles of the hand in their place, are fituated partly in the palm, and jiartly on the back of the hand. In the back of the hand are—the external tranfverfe li- gament of the carpus—vaginal—and tranfverfe liga- ments of the extctifor tendons. In the palm of the hand—the internal tranfverfe ligament of the carpus —vaginal or crucial ligaments of the flexor tendons of the phalanges—and the acceflbry ligaments of the flexor tendons, LIGAMENTS OF THE ARTICULATION OP' THE FEMUR. The head of the os femorls is flrongly annexed' to the acetabulum of the os innominatum by two very flvonsj,' C 35 ] ftrong ligaments—the capfular ligament—and liga- mentum teres. LIGAMENTS OF THE ARTICULATION OF THE KNEE. The articulation of the knee is formed by the con* dyles of the os femoris, head of the tibia and patella. The ligaments are the capfular—pofterior—external and Internal lateral ligaments—crucial and alar liga- ments—ligaments of the femilunar cartilages—and ligaments of the patella. LIGAMENTS OF THE FIBULA. The fibula is connected with the tibia by means of the capfular ligament of the fuperior extremity—in- terofieous ligament—and ligaments of the inferior ex- tremity. LIGAMENTS OF THE ARTICULATION OF THE TARSUS. The inferior extremity of the tibia and fibula forms the cavity into which the talus or aftragalus of the tarfus is received. This articulation is etfe6ted by the anterior—middle—and pofterior ligament of the fibula—ligamentum tibiae deitoides—capfular liga- ment—and the ligaments proper to the bones of the tarfus. LIGAMENTS OF THE METATARSUS. The bones of the mctatarfus arc conncfted in part together, and in part with the tarfus, by means of the capfular ligament—articular ligaments—tranfverfe li- D a gamentsL 5^ ] gaments in the back and foie of the foot—and' the Ira- terolTeous ligaments of the metatarfus. LIGAMENTS OF THE TOES. The phalanges of the toes are united partly toge- ther, and partly with the metatarfus, by thie capfular and lateral ligaments. ligaments which retain THE TENDONS OF THE mrSCLES OF the foot in their proper place.- Thefc ligaments are found partly in the back and partly in the foie of the foot. They are the vaginal ligament of the tibia—tranfverfe or crucial Hgamentfi of the tarfus—ligaments of the tendons of the pero- nei mufcles—the laciniated ligament—the vaginal li- gament of the extcnfor mufcle and flexor pollicls— the'vaginal ligaments of the flexor tendons—the ac- ceflfory ligaments of the flexor tendons—and the tranf- verfe ligaments of the extenfor tendons.I 57 ]■■ >< O VO tT3 ■ Ji c« O Uh C ^ -e ^ o bi u ^ O *!Z ^ rt C ^_i C ^ 4J g J3 U ^ jo V '~0 '■^ ^ > r U C j:^ ^ CO — CO H3 <L> cn ^ cL.2 ii ^ ^ w .t: CO -s C U • -H ^ • -H CO r:^ ^ S I .S - > 2 'g -2 « ° s “f ? 03 .a; (U ^ T' I i: fe I X ^ ^ . ^-2 S ° J3 c- — U <I .

Divifion, into arteries — veins—and abforbents. Situation, except the epider- mis, membrana arachnoidea and nails, every part of the body has velfels. OF THE ARTERIES IN GENERAL. Arteries are membranous canals, which pulfatc. In general they become narrower as they proceed from the heart towards the extremities. Origin, from the ventricles of the heart—namely, the pulmonary artery from the right, and the aorta from the left ven- tricle ; thus there are only two arteries, of which the reft are branches. Termination, in veins, exhaling veftels, or they anaftomofe with one another. C'^ni- pofecl of three membranes—external or common— middle or mufcular—and inner or fmooth. Ufe, to convey blood from the heart to the different parts ot the body, for nutrition—jirefervation of life—genera- tion of heat—and the fecretlon of dUTcrent fluids. Tiir[ 83 ] The G 2 THE SYSTEM OF THE AORTA. The aorta arifes from the left ventricle of the heart, forms an arch towards the dorfal vertebrae, then de- fcends through the opening of the diaphragm Into the abdomen, in which it proceeds by the left fide of the fpine to the laft vertebra of the loins, where it divides into the two iliac arteries. The aorta gives off, juft above Its origin, the coro- nary arteries of the heart. The arch of the arota gives off, . I. The arteria innominata, which divides Into the right carotid and right fubclavian arteries. IT. The left carotid. III. The left fubclavian. Each carotid is divided Into the external and Inter- nal : the external gives off eight branches to the neck and face, Anteriorly, i. The fuperior thyroldeal, or guttural. 2. The fublingual, or ranine. 3. The Inferior maxillary. 4. The external maxillary, from which arlfe the fafcial, or mental, coronary of the lips, and the angular. Pofterlorly, jj. The internal maxillary, from which arlfe the fphaeno-maxillar, inferior, alveolar, and the fpinous artery. 6. The occipital. 7. The external auditory. 8. The temporal, of which the frontal is a branch.The [" S4 ]■ The internal carotid, or cerebral, gives off* four branches within the cavity of the cranium : 1, The anterior cerebral. 2. The pofferior. 3, The central artery of the optic nerve. 4. The internal orbital. The Juhclavia?! gives off four branches : 1. The internal mammary, from whence come the mediaftinal, thymal, and pericardiac. 2. The cervical, which is either anterior or pofferior. 3. The vertebral, which uniting within the cranium with its fellow forms the bafilary artery, internal auditory, and the pofferior of the dura mater. 4. The fuperior intercoffal. As foon as the fuhclavian has arrived in the axilla, it is called the axillary, which runs into the arm, where it is termed the brachial. The axillary gives off, 1. The external mammar)*. 2. The inferior thoracic. 3. The fcapular. 4. The humeral. The brachial gives off, 1. Many lateral velfels. 2. The cubital. -j, I'hc radial.[ ] The cubital fends off, 1. The recurrent. 2. The ejcternal Interolfeal, 3. The internal Interolfeal. 4. The palmar arch. 5. The digital. The radial gives off the radial recurrent. The dcfcendlng aorta gives off, in the breajl, four branches : T, The bronchial. 2. The aefophageal, 5. The inferior intercoftals. 4. The inferior diaphragmatic. The dejcending aorta gives off, w'tbin the abdomen, eight branches I. The caeliac : from whence are 1. Two diaphragmatics or inferior phrenics. 2. The coronary of the flomach. 3. The hepatic : from which arife, a. I'he pyloric. b. The greater or right gaftric, which gives oft' the duodenal and right gaftro- epiploic. c. The cyftic, or capfular. J. The fplenic, from which arife the pan- creatic—the lelfer, or left gaftric—■ the fliort arteries, and the epiploic. 2. The[ 86 ] 2. The fuperior mefenteric, or mereralc, of which the fuperior or right colic artery is a branch. 3. The renal arteries, or emulgents. 4. The fpermatic arteries. 5. The inferior meferaic, from which arifes the internal haemorrhoidal. 6. The lumbar arteries. 7. The facral arteries. 8. The iliac arteries. The are divided into Internal and external. Each internal iliac gives off five branches : 1. The little iliac. 2. The gluteal. 3. The ifchiatic. 4. The communis, or internal pudendal, from which arile the external hoemorrhoidal and pudendal. 5. The obturatory. Each external iliac gives off The epigatlric, and The fmall external iliac. The trunk of the external iliac is continued into the cruralf and the crural into the popliteal. The popliteal divides into, 1. The anterior tiblal. 2. The pofterlor tibial, from which arife the ex- ternal tibial—peroneal or fibular—internal and external j)lantar — and plantal arch, which gives rife to the digital arteries. TJIEThe [ 8; ] THE PULMONARY ARTERY AND VEIN. ’Yht pulmonary artery arifes from the right ventricle of the heart, and divides into the right and left, which ramify throughout the lungs, and terminate in the })ulmonary veins, whofe branches at length form four trunks, which empty t-hemfelves into the left auricle of the heart. OF THE VEINS IN GENERAL. Veins are membranous canals which do not pulfate. 1'hey gradually become larger as they advance towards the heart, in which they terminate and bring back the blood from the arteries. Origin. From the capillary extremities of the arteries by anafiamofis. Termlna- tmi of all the veins is into the auricles of the heart. D vlfion, into trunks, branches, ramuli, &c. Sltua- ilon. 'Fhcy run by the tides of arteries, but more fu- perficially. Compojed like arteries of three membranes, but which are femi-tranfparent and more delicate. Valves are thin femilunar membranous folds, which prevent the return of the blood in the vein. THE VENA CAVA. The vena cava terminates in the right auricle of the heart, and receives the blood from The fuperior cava, 'Fhe inferior cava. G4[ 88 ] The The vena cava Juperior receives the blood from The right and left fubclavlan. External jugular veins, and Vena azygos. The veins which terminate in the external jugular vein are, 1.

The trunk of this vein, about the fif- fure of the liver in which it is fiiuatcd, is divided into the hepatic and abdominal portions. 1'he abdominal portion is compoled of three venous branche.«, vii. tliefplenic, inejcraic, and internal ha~ morrbo'dal. Thefe three venous branches carry all the blood from the llomach, fpleen, pancreas, omentum, me- fentery, gall bladder, and the fmall and large inteftines into iht frius of the vena portae. The hepatic part of the vena port.ae enters the fubllance of the liver—all the hepatic branches con- .verge and fecrete the bile in the liver.[ 91 1 The blood returning from the liver Is carried through the hepatic veins Into the vena cava, ai'cend- Ing under the liver. OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IN THE FCETUS. The foetus rccanu's Its blood from the mother through the umbilical 'vein, and tranjmits It to the mother by the umbilical arteries. The blood In the foetus runs from the r'gbt ventricle of the heart Into the left, by three ways—by the pulmonary artery—foramen ovale—and canalis arte- riofus. OF THE ABSORBENTS.

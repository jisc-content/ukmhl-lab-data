SACRAL NERVES. 592 are divisible into external, internal, and middle. Tlie external cutaneous branches are sevei'al lilanieuts wliicli tui-n around the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the integu- ment over the lii]) and outer side of the thigh. The internal cutaneous branches are dis- trilnited to the in- tegument of the upper and inner part of the thigli. One of these, larger than the rest, in- ferior pudendal, curves around the tuberosity of the ischium, pierces the fascia lata near the ramus of that l^one, and, after communicating with one of the superficial peri- neal nerves, is dis- tributed to the in- tegument of the scrotum and peni?;. The middle cu- taneous branches, two or three in number, are de- rived from the lesser ischiatic in its course down the thigh, and are distributed to the integument. The GREAT ISCHIATIC NERVE is the largest nervous cord in the body ; it is formed by the sacral plexus, or rather is a pro- longation of the plexus, and at its exit from the great sacro-ischiatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle measures tliree-tiuarters ot an inch in breadth. It descends through the middle of the space be- I Fig. 342.â€”Dissec- tion of the but- tock and back of tlietliigh. I. Glu- teus maximus. 2. Gluteus medi- us. 3. Gluteal artery and nerve. 4.

Externally. Innominate artery, Pleura. Qilsophagus. EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The external carotid artery ascends nearly perpendicularly from opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to the sj)ace between the neck of the lower jaw and meatus auditorius, where it divides into two terminal branches, temporal and internal maxillary. Plan of the Relations of the External Carotid Artery. Superficial aspect. Integument and fascia, Platysma, Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, Hypoglossal nerve, Facial nerve, Temporo-maxillary vein. Parotid gland. External Carotid Artery. Deep aspect. Stylo-pharyngeus, Stylo-glossus, Glosso-phai-yngeal nerve, Parotid gland. Anteriorly. Hyoid bone, Phaiynx. Parotid gland, Ramus of jaw. Branches.—Tlie branches of the external carotid, nine in num- ber, may be arranged into three groujis, anterior, posterior, and ascending. They are as follows :— Anterior. Superior thyroid. Lingual, Facial. Posterior. Occipital, Posterior auricular. Ascending and Terminal. Ascending pharyngeal. Parotid ean, Temporal, Internal maxillary. ihe anterior branches arise from the commencement of the external carotid, within a short distance of each other. The lingual and facial not unfrequently arise from a common trunk The SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY, the first of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk just below the ^reat cornu of the hyoid bone and curves downwards to the thyroid gFand it IS distributed by several large In-anches to the anterior part of the gland, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with

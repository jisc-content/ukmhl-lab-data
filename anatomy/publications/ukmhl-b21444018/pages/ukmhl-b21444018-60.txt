The striao are more faintly marked than those of oi-dinary stri])ed muscle, and tlie iibres are smaller, and have no sai'colemma ; they are reniarkaljle for their mimei-ous brandies and fre(juent anastomoses, and are formed ])y the union of distinct cells joined end to end. Each cell has a single nucleus near its centre and one or' two nucleoli ; they frequently contain small fatty granules which are greatly multiplied in fatty degenera- tion of the heart. NERVE TISSUE.

The brain and spinal cord constitute the great nervous centre, or cerebro-spinal axis, and the great majority of the nerves spring from this centre or are connected with it. Theri' also exists a secondary system oi' nerves called sympathetic, the cen- tres of which occur in the form of numerous minute masses named ganglia, which are distributed chiefly in the thorax and alxlo- men, and are intimately connected with the nerves going to the organs contained in those cavities. The sympathetic and cerebro-spinal nerves have frequent communica- tions with each other, which form complicated net\\'orks or j^lexiLScs. The nerve tissues are readily separable into two forms, the white and the grey; the former con.sti- tutes the greater portion of the interior of the brain, the outer part of the spinal cord, and all the nerves which spring from these ; the latter exists in the in- terior of the spinal cord, on llie surface of the brain, in the in- terior of the Ijrain near its l);ise, and in the sympathetic and cere- The structural elements of the nervous system

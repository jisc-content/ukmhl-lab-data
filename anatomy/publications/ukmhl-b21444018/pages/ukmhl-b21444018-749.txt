RIGHT AURICLE. direction of these two vessels is such, that a stream forced through the superior cava would rush towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. In like manner, a jet issuing from the inferior cava would dash its stream against the septum auriculariim ; this is the proper direction of the two currents during fcetal life. The coronary sinus returns the venous blood from the substance of the heart; it opens into the auricle between the inferior cava and auriculo-ventricular opening, under cover of the coronary valve. The foramina Thebesii are minute pore-like openings of small veins which issue directly from the muscular structure of the heart, Fig. 384.â€”Anatomy of the heart. : I. Right auricle. 2.

The comparative tliickness of the two ventricles IS sliown in the diagram. The course of the pure blood through the left side of the heart is marked by arrows. The blood is brought from the lungs by the four pulmonary veins into the left auricle, and passes tlirough the iiuriculo-ventricular opening into the left ventricle, whence it is conveved by the aorta to every part of the body. without entering the venous current. Similar openings are also found in the left auricle, and in the right and left ventricles, but, in the latter, they are commonly not the termination of vessels but mere csecal depressions. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large opening of com- municatu)n l)etween the auricle and ventricle. It is oval in form, and admits tliree fingers easily. The Eustachian valve is\a part of the apparatus of ffctal circu- lation, and serves to direct the placental blood from the inferior

SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY. 384 the inferior thyroid arteries. In its course it passes beneatli the onio-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles. Branches.— Hyoid, Superior laryngeal, Sterno-mastoid. Inferior laryngeal, Muscular, Glandular. The hyoid branch passes forward beneath the thyro-hyoid musclo. and is distributed to the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone neai their insertion. It an- astomoses with'its felloM of the opposite side, aiu with the hyoid brand of the lingual. The superior laryni geal pierces the tliyro hyoid membrane, ii company with the supe rior laryngeal nerve and supplies the mucoii membrane and muscle of ■ the-larynx, sendin; a branch upwards to tin j epiglottis. I The sterno-mastoiw is commonly a brand 1 of this trunk, althougH it sometimes comes oil directly from the exter- nal carotid.

Ascending jg .j, small branch wllic pharyngeal. crosses the crico-thyroi membrane along the lower Ijorder of the thyroid cartilage. It send branches through that membrane to supply the mucous lining c the larynx, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The muscular branches are distributed to the depressor muscle of the hyoid l)one and larynx. Numerous glandular branches are distributed to the lateral lobe

SPINAL COED. 489 Most of the cells are stellate or multipolar, but they vary greatly in their size and arrangement; they have no distinct sheath, possess a large nucleus and one or more nucleoli, and contain an intercellular and internuclear network. The outer edge of each grey crescent is very irregular, especially at the root of the anterior horn, where the margin is broken up by neuroglia fibres into a network, the meshes of which contain nerve-fibres ; this is called the lateral reticular fwmation. In the upper dorsal region the grey matter forms a j)ro- jection into the lateral white column opposite the grey commis- sure, sometimes described as the lateral horn. The nerve-cells are largest in the anterior cornu, where they are chiefly gathered into two groups, called the antero-internal group and the antero-external group. Another collection of somewhat smaller cells is, found in the dorsal region of the cord in the lateral extension of the J i iG. 290 -Diagi-am of the tracts of the spmal cord. i.

483 THOEACIC DUCT. inclines to the left side, passes behind the arch of the aorta, and iscends by the side of the oesophagus, and behind the perpendicular portion of the left subclavian artery to the root of the neck opposite the seventh cervical vertebra, where it makes a sudden curve for- ivards and downwards in front of the scalenus anticus muscle, and Fig. 288.â€”The course and termination of the thoracic duct. 1. Arch of the aorta. 2. Thoracic aorta. 3. Ab- dominal aorta, showing its principal branches divided near their origin. 4. Ar- teria innominata, dividing into right carotid and right subclavian. 5. Left caro- tid. 6. Left subclavian. 7. Superior cava, formed by the union of (8) the two vense innominatse; and these by the junction (9) of the internal jugular and subclavian vein at each .side. 10. Greater vena jizygos. II. Termination of the lesser in the greater vena azygos. 12. Recepta- culum chyli; several lym- phatic trunks are seen opening into it. 13. Thor- acic duct, dividing oppo- site the middle of the dorsal vertebra} into two branches which reunite ; the course of the duct be- hind the arch of the aorta and left subclavian artery is shown by a dotted line. 14. The duct making its turn at the root of the neck and receiving seve- ral lymphatic trunks pre- viously to terminating in the posterior aspect of the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian vein. 15. Tei-mination of the trunk of the ductus lymphaticus dextei-. terminates at tlie point of junction of the left subclavian with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic - duct is about eighteen or twenty inches in length, and near its origin as large as a goose quill; as it ascends, it diminishes in size, and near its termination again becomes dilated. At the middle of tlie thorax it frequently divides into two branches of equal size, which reunite after a short course ; and sometimes it gives off several branches, which assume a plexiform arrangement

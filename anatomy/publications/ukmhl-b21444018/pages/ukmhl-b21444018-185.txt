HUMERUS. 141 neck and is so named, in contradistinction to the anatomical neck, hom being the seat of the accident called by surgical writers fracture of the neck of the humerus. The shaft of the bone is somewhat cylindrical at its uppei part, and flattened from before backwards below. On the outer side at about its middle, is a rough triangular eminence (deltoid tuberosity), Fir. 129. Fig. 130. < i Fig. 129.—Humerusoftherightarm jit.s anterior surface, i. Sliaft of the bone. 2.

On the inner side of the middle of the shaft is a smooth surface for the attachment of the coraco- brachialis muscle ; and behind, an oblique and shallow groove (musculo-spiral groove), which lodges the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The foramen for the medullary vessels is situated on the inner surface of the shaft of the bone a little below tlie coraco-brachial impression ; it is directed downwards. The lower extremity is flattened behind and convex in front; it is terminated inferiorly by a long articular surface, divided into two parts by an elevated ridge. The external portion of the articular

" The pelvic fascia is a strong fibrous layer situated beneath the peritoneum, forming a covering to tlie walls of the pelvis, and reflected froni its walls on to the viscera. It corresponds in position in the pelvis to the fascia lining the abdominal wall (transversalis fascia), and with that covering the iliacus muscle in the iliac fossa (ilia.'

The pelvic fascia is, for convenience of description, divided into a parietal and a visceral layer. The parietal layer of pelvic fascia is connected with the back part of the pectineal line, being there coiitinuons with the iliac fascia; it then passes obliquely downwards and forwards, along the upper edge of the obturator internus muscle to the ujiper margin of the obturator foramen ; it here leaves the bone, and passing over the upper edge of the obturator muscle joins the obturator membrane, thus converting the groove on the under surface of the pubic bone into a canal for the obturator vessels and nerve. Again reaching the bone, it descends still lower, being found at the middle line of tlie i

The short process is a conical elevation at the junction of the manu- brium with the rest of the bone; into it is inserted the tendon of the tensor tympani. The articular surface consists of an oval de- pressed area, surrounded by prominent ridges; the former corre- FiG. 373.—Profile view of left tympanic cavity, membrane and ossicles (E. A.

The incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resemblance to an anvil. It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer than, and Avidely separated from, the other. It consists of two processes, united nearly at right angles, and at their junction forming a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus. The short process is attached to the margin of the opening

THORACIC DUCT. 484 in this situation. Occasionally the thoracic duct bifurcates at the upper part of the thorax into two branches, one of whicli operiB into tlie point of junction between the right subclavian and jugular vein, while the other proceeds to the normal termination of the duct on the left side. The thoracic duct presents fewer valves in its course than lym- phatic vessels generally ; at its termination it is provided with a pair of semilunar valves, to prevent the admission of venous Ijlood. Branches.â€” i'he thoracic duct receives at its commencement foui' or five large lymphatic trunks, which unite to form the receptaculuiu chyli ; it next receives the trunks of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax it is joined by the lymphatic vessels from the left half of the thoracic wall, those of the sternal and intercostal glands, those of the left lung, left side of the heart, trachea, and tt'sophagus, and as it curves forwards in the neck it is joined Ijy lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, and left uj^per extremity. The ductus lymphaticus dexter is a short trunk which receives the lymphatic vessels from the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, right lung, and one or two branches from the iipper convex surface of the liver. It terminates at the junction of the right subclavian with the right internal jugular vein, at the point where these veins unite to form the right innominate vein ; and is provided at its termination with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the entrance of blood from the veins.

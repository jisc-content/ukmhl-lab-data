The branches of the posterior tibial nerve are — three or four muscular twigs to the deep muscles of the pos- terior aspect of the leg, the Ijranch to the flexor longus hallucis accom- panies the nutrient artery of the fibula ; one or two filaments which entwine around the artery and then terminate in the integument; and a plantar cutaneous branch which pierces the internal anmilar ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the heel and inner border of the sole of the foot. The INTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE, larger than the external, crosses the posterior tibial vessels to enter the sole of the foot, and becomes j^laced be- tween the abductor hallucis and Hexor brevis digitorum ; it then enters the sheath of the latter muscle, and divides opposite the base of the metatarsal bones into thi'ee digital branches ; one to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toe ; the second, the adjacent sides of the second and third toe ; the third, the corresponding sides of the third and fourth toe. In its course the internal j^lantar nerve gives off cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner side and sole of the foot; muscular bi'anches to the muscles forming the inner and middle group of the sole ; a digitu branch to the inner border of the grea toe; and articular branches to th articulations of the tarsal and meta tarsal bones. The EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE, the smaller of the two, follows tli course of the external plantar arter to tlie outer border of the musculu Fig. 343.—Superficial nerves of the back of the leg. i.

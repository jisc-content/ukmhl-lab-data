296 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL IlKllNlA. SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. Inguinal liernia is of two kinds, oljlique and direct. In OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA the intestine follows the same course as is pursued by the testicle in its descent, and obtains the same coverings as that organ. It escapes from the cavity of the abdomen into the spermatic or inguinal canal, through the internal abdominal ring, pressing before it a pouch of peritoneum whicli constitutes the hernial sac, and distending the infundibuliform pro- cess of the transversalis fascia. After emerging through the internal abdominal ring it passes firstly beneath the lower and arched bordei- of the internal oblique muscle ; and then through the external abdo- FiG. 207.—Diagram of a common scro- tal hernia, show- ing the relation of the sac to the tunica vaginalis testis.

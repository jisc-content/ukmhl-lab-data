654 ORGAN OF TASTE. rior fourth due to the liiqjection of thickly crowded mucous glands. A raphe marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The papillae of the tongue are the— Circumvallate papillae, Filiform papillae, Fungiform papilla3. The circumvallate papillae (p. lenticulares) are of large size, and from fifteen to twenty in number. They are situated on the dorsiun of the tongue, near its root, and form a row at each side, which meets its fellow at the middle line, like the two branches of the letter A. Each pajjilla resembles a cone, attached by its apex to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression ; hence they are also named papillae calyciformes. This cup- shajjed cavity forms a kind of fossa around the papilla, Avhence their name circumvallatae. At the meeting of the two rows of these papil- lae upon the middle of the root of the tongue, is a dee}} depression called foramen caecum, into Av^hich several mucous follicles open. The filiform papillae cover the whole surface of the tongue in front of the circumvallate j^apil- lae, but are most abun- dant towards its anterior _ part. They are conical Fig. 381.—Filiform papillse of tongue, a. Ai-tery. at their base, and have V. Vein, p, p. Primary papillaj. e, e.

They are ar- ranged in rows, which at the back part of the tongue are nearly parallel with the circumvallate papilla), but get more longitudinal in their direction as we proceed forwards, so that at the tijj of the tongue they get to be nearly parallel ^\-ith the raphe.

STRUCTURE OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. 55 branes, arranged so as to form a lioneycomb, and covered by numerous flattened endothelial cells. The reticnhim is croAvded with lymph Pig. 67.—Section of a small lymphatic gland, half diagrammatically given, with the course of the lymph, a. The capsule. I). Septa between the alveoli of the cortical portion. c. Septa of the medullary portion, down to the hilus of the organ, d. Adenoid tis- sue, c. Lymph vessels of the medullary mass. /. Different lymphatic streams which surround the follicles, and flow through the interstices of the medullary por- tion, g. Confluence of these passing through the efferent vessel, h, at the hilus of the organ. corpuscles of small size. The lymphoid tissue contains a dense network of capillary blood-vessels. Course of the Lymph. —The aft'erent vessels, after branching ujion and in the tissue of the ca]3- •sule, open into the lymph sinus in the cortex of the gland ; the efferent vessels, on the other hand, commence by small liranches connected with the sinus in the medul- lary meshes. The lymph enters the cortical alveoli by the affer-ent ^-essels, traverses the lymph path in the cortex, from thence jDasses into the medulla, and taking its course through the lymph ]iath in that part of the gland, reaches the efferent vessel, and by it leaves tlie gland, the lymph cells which it receives in such large numbers in passing through the gland are derived from the lymphoid tissue tilling up the great part of the Fic. 68.—Part of medulla of a lymphatic gland. a. Trabecula cut longitudinally, b. Surface of tlie trabocula covered by endothelium, c. Lymph sinus ci. Medullary cylinders composed of lym- phoid tissue.

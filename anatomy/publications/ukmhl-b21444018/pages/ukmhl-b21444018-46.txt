.CARTILAGE. i8 b. Pair of cells in apposition, c, c. Nuclei of cartilage cells, d. Cavity containing three cells. each other ; these channels are believed to be connected with the lynij)hatic .systejn. The matri.v in some instances can be broken up l)y ])rolonged niaceru- .^^^ tion into line fil)rils, ha\ - '^■'■^ ing the siiine chemical charactei's as the fibres of connective tissue. Hya- line cartilages have been divided into temporanj, which ultimately become converted into l)one, and periimnent, which remain throughout the whole of life ; the majority of the latter are articular, that is, they coat the ends of the bones entering into Fig. 28.—Branchial cartilage of a tadpole, a. Group the formation of joints, of foiir cells separating from each other. 6. Pair costal cartilage the cells are lai'ge and are collected into groups; the matrix is traversed by patches of white fibres, and frequently contains vascular channels of considerable size ; it is very prone to calcification in old age. Articular cartilage forms a thin coating on the articular surface of bones ; it has a faintly granular matrix, wdiich has a tendency to split vertically to the surface. It is not covered by perichon- drium. The surface cells become branched, and gradually change their character where the synovial membrane joins the cartilage, so as at length to Ije indistin- guishable from the con- nective tissue coriDuscles of that membrane. Yellow or Elastic Fibro - Cartilage {Re- ticular Cartilage) is com- l)osed of cells {^^i^ of an inch in diameter), .sepa- rated from each other by an opaque, filirous, inter- cellular network, the breadth of the cells being considerably gi'eater than Fig. 29.-Yellow or elastic fibro-cartilagc, showing tliat of the intercellular cells in capsules and elastic fibres lu matrix. , , mi .-i structiu-e. 1 he fibres arc short, imperfect, loose in texture, and yellowisli ; they are un- affected by acetic acid and do not yield chondrin.

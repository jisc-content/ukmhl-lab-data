509 LATERAL VENTRICLES. small and tapering, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventricle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius. This foramen may be seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum hicidum with the "handle of the knife. It is situated between the under surface of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, and forms a communication transversely between the lateral ventricles, and perpendicularly with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus presents on its surface a number of minute vascular processes, which are termed villi. They are covered bv an epithelium consisting of a single layer of nucleated polygonal Fig. 304.â€”Lateral ventricles of the cerebrum, t, i.

This plexus communicates with that of the opposite ventricle through the fora- men of Monro ; a bristle is passed through this opening (under figure 4), and its ex- tremities are seen resting on the corpus striatum at each side. The figure 11 rests on the edge of the fornix, on that part of it which is called corpus fimbriatum. 12. Fornix. 13. Commencement of the hippocampus major.

Besides the nucleus the cells contain numerous yellow granules and one or two dark oil-drops ; and, according to Heiile, give off from their angles spine-like processes, wliicli are connected \vith the bed of homogeneous areolar tissue on which they rest. The chief arteries of the choroid jilexxises enter at the lower ex- tremity of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle ; others enter it from behind by passing beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum ; the veins terminate in the veins of Galen. The corpus fimbriatum is a narrow white band, situated inter- nally to the choroid plexus, and extending with it into the descend- ing cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thin

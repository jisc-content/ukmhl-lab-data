CRANIAL NERVES. 544 facial and aunculo-temporal nerves. In the temporal fossa it com municates with the dec]) temporal nerves. Tlie malar, or inferior branch (subcutaneous malce) takes its course along tlie lower aiialc oi the outer wall of the orbit, and emerges on the cheek tlirougli ai, opening m the malai- Ijone, passing between tlie filn-es of the orlncu- hu-is palpebrarum muscle. It communicates with branches of the intra-orbital and facial nerve. The spheno-palatine branches, two in number, pass downward- to the spheuo-palatine oi' Meckel's ganglion. The posterior dental branches, two in number, pass downwards upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, where one entei s Pio. 324. â€” Pterygo- maxillary region and fifth nerve, i.

The middle and anterior dental branches descend to the corre- sponding teeth and gums ; the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. Previously to their distribution, the dental nerves form a plexus in the outer wall of the su]ierior maxillary bone immediately above the alveolus.

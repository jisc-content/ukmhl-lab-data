LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 196 The posterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and con- nects the saci'um with the coccyx i^osteriorly, extending as far as the apex oi tlie latter hone. It is a direct continuation of the posterior common ligament, and becomes connected with the termination of Fig. 162.—Ligaments of pelvis and hip-joint, i. Posterior sacro-iliao ligament. 2. Great sacro-sciatic ligament. 3. Oblique sacro-iliac ligament. 4. Lesser sacro- sciatic ligament. 5. The same, exposed by the removal of the greater. 6. Back part of capsule of hii5-joint. 7. Posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament. the supraspinous ligament, and the filum terminale of the sj)inal cord. Between the two bones is a thin intervertebral disc of fibro- cartilage; and in females not unfrequently a synovial membrane. The articulation admits of a certain degree of mo^■ement backward.s during parturition. The ligaments connecting the different pieces of the coccyx con- sist of a few scattered anterior and posterior fibres, and a thin disc of interosseous cartilage ; the latter exists only in the young subject, as, in the adult, the pieces become ossified. 4. Between the Pubic Bones.—This articulation receives the name of symphysis pubis ; it is an exanqjle of an amphi-arthrodial joint. The anterior pubic ligament is composed of ligamentous fibres, 5 6

ABDOMINAL AORTA.^ 420 It is ill relation, in the right border of the lesser omentum, with the ductus communis choledochus and poi -* tal vein, lying to the left of the former structure and on a plane anterior to the latter; it is surround- ed by the hepatic plexus of nerves, and numerous lympha- tics. There are some- times two hepatic arteries, in which ciise one is derived from the superior mesenteric. The branches of the hepatic artery are the— Pyloric, Gastro-duodenal, Gastro - epiploica dextra, Pancreatico - duo- denalis superior, Cystic. The pyloric branch, given off from the hepatic near the pylorus,r ims from left to right along the lesser curve of the stomach, where it in- osculates with the gastric artery, and gives branches to the coats of the stomach and to the lesser omentum. The gastro-duo- denal artery is a short but large trunk, which descends be- hind the pylorus, and divides into two Pin 2■50 —Abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. i. Hepatic veins (cut). 2.

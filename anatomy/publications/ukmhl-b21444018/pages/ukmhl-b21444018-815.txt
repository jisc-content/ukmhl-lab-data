STRUCTUEE OF THE STOMACH. 727 roidal or oval, and coarsely granular (parietal or oxyntic cells) ; towards the bottom of the gland, however, the parietal cells do not form a continuous layer, but only occur here and there, the intervals between them being filled up with polyhedral, finely granular cells {central cells). Between the glands the mucous membrane consists of connective tissue with a considerable amount of lymphoid tissue. Fia. 438.—Gastric mucous glands.

Between the mucous membrane and submucous tissue a small (piantity of unstriped muscular fibre is found, forming the mitscularis mucosa'. The nerves of the stomach are derived from the vagus nerves and the solar plexus ; small ganglia are found in their course, and they forni a plexus in the muscular coat {flexiis myentericus), and a second one in the submucous coat.

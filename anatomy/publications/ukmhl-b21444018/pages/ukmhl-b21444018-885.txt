793 STRUCTUEE OF THE OVARIES. cells of this outer membrane differ from those of the peritoneum in being columnar or prigmatic, and in their giving to the surface a dull appearance instead of the smooth glistening character usually distin- guishing serous mem- branes ; the cells have received the name of germ epithelium because they originate the ova. Be- neath this membrane is a layer of condensed stroma, having a white appearance, and called from its supposed resem- blance to one of the coats of the testicle the tunica cUbnginea. The deep part of the stroma is formed of fibrous tissue containing a large number of nuclei and some elastic tissue ; the fibres radiate from the attached border or hilus towards the circumference in small bundles. Under- neath the capsule, the tissue of the oi^gan is crowded Avith closely set vesicles, forming an early condition of the char- acteristic structures of the ovary, the Graafian vesi- cles ; deeper in, the vesicles are less numerous but much larger. The ovisac or Graafian vesicle is a vesicle consist- ing of an external mem- brane and fluid contents. The membrane is com- posed of an outer coat formed by the condensa- tion of the stroma, and sometimes named the tunica fibrosa, a liase- Pin. 490.—Section of ovary, a. Germ epithelium. b.

They correspond in length with the breadth of the plate, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clusters of glan- dular vesicles open; the latter are so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out on the edges of the lids. Occasionallj'^ an arch is formed between two of the follicles, pro- ducing a graceful ap- pearance. The tubes are lined Ijy a stratified epithelium, and the gland vesicles by cubi- cal cells ; the lumen of the gland is usually filled up with the fatty secretion and partly disintegrated epithe- lial cells. The edges of the eyelids are furnished with strong, short, curved hairs, called eyelashes (cilia), ar- ranged in two to four rows ; those of the upper lid curving up- wards, and those of the lower downwards, so as not to interlace Avith each other in the closure of the lids, and prove an iuqiedi- ment to the opening of the eyes. Near the point of emergence of the eyelashes are the openings of the rjlands of Moll, arranged in Fkj. 355.â€”Vertical antero-posteriov section of upper eyelid. a. Skin. b.

i88 TEMPORO-MAXILLAEY ARTICULATION and odontoid jirocess ; and another between tliat process and liie antei-ior arcli of tlie atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiai' disposition of tlie transverse ligament in relation to the odontoid ]irocess that enables the atlas, and witli it the entire craninni, to rotate upon the axis ; the perfect freedom of movement between these l)ones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower pai't of the ring, formed bv the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, Avhile the summit of the odontoid process is lai-ger than its base ; hence the jirocess is retained in its place by the transverse ligament when the other liga- ments are cut through. The extent to which rotation of the hearl u])on the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid or check ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axial ligament. S. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION.—Tlie ligaments of this joint are the following :— External lateral, Two internal lateral, Capsular, Intei^articular libro-cartilage, Stylo-maxil lary 1 igament, Two synovial membranes. The external lateral ligament is a short and thick l)and of hbres, passing obliquely backwards from the tubercle of the zygoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. It is incorporated with the capsular ligament, and is, in relation, ex- ternally, with the integument of the face; internally, with the two synovial membranes of the articulation and the interarticular cartilage. The short internal lateral ligament has a broad attachment above to the outer part of the spine of the sphenoid, and is in- FiG. 155.—E.Ktcnmi view of the articulserted below into the ridge on the alc^."'..* TuScTe i7tl.e\%'Z.'''t i^^^' '^'^^.^{^^'^ "^^^ of the COU- Ramus of the lower jaw. 4.

The long internal lateral ligament (spheno-maxillary) is a thin aponeurotic expansion extending from the extremity of the sjiinous process of the sphenoid bone to the margin of the dental foramen ; it is pierced at its insertion by the mylo-hyoidean nerve. Between the internal latei'al ligament and neck of the jaw is a triangular space, in which are situated the internal maxillary artery, auriculo-temporal nerve, inferior dental artery and nerve, and part

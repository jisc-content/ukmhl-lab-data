667 MITRAL VALVE. valves, and the tendinous cords and musciihar colnnins ; they may l.)e thus arranged :— Auricnlo-ventricular ojDening, Mitral valve, Aortic opening. Semilunar valves. Chordae tendinea3, Columnie carnese. . The auriculo-ventricular opening is a dense fibrous ring covered T)y the endocardium, but smaller in size than that of the right side: Its fibrous structure is closely connected with that of the right auri- culo-ventricular and aortic rings ; at the junction of the three there is a fibro-cartilaginous mass, and in some animals (as the ox) a partial ring of bone called os cordis. The mitral valve is attached around the auriculo-ventricular opening, as is the tricusj)id in the right ventricle. It is thicker than the tricuspid, and consists of two segments, of which the anterior is the largest and is placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of tlie aorta. The posterior is placed behind and to the left of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The difi'erence in size of the two valves, both being triangular, and the space between them, has given rise to the idea of a bishop's mitre after which they are named. Two small secondary flaps are placed between the two larger ones. These valves, like the tricuspid, are fur- nished with an ap- paratus of tendinous chords, chordce ien- dinece, which are at- tached to two very large musculi pa2:)ii- lares. Tliecolumnaecar- nese are smaller than those of the right ven- tricle, but are more numerous and more closely reticulated ; they admit of the same arrangement into three kinds as on the right side. Those which are free by one extremity, the musculi papillares, ai'e two in number,'and larger than those on the opposite side, one being placed on the left Fir,. 388.—ycction ot licirt at level of valves, as seen from above.

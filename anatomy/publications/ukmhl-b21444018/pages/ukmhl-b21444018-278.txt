210 AKTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. are Jlexion and extension. When the finger is extended the lateral ligaments are in a condition of relaxation, and adduction, abduction, and circumduction take place ; when, however, the finger is flexed, Fig. 172. — Lateral and anterior liga- ments of meta- carpo - i)lialan(ieal and interphalan- geal joints ; show- ing their condition during flexion. 1, 1, I. Posterior part of lateral ligaments tense. 2, 2, 2. Anterior ligaments. 3, 3, 3. Anterior part of lateral ligaments relaxed. these ligaments become tense and all lateral movement is pre- vented. II. ARTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES.—These articulations are ginglymus joints ; and furnished with three ligaments :— Anterior, Two lateral. The anterior ligament, firm and fibro-cartilaginous, forms part of the articular surface for the head of the phalanges ; Avhile exter- nally it is grooved for the reception of the flexor tendons. The lateral ligaments are very strong, and the j)rincipal bond of connection between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the ofiice of a posterior ligament. Actions.—The movements of the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension, these movements being more free between the first and second than between the second and third. LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The ligaments of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be arranged in the order of the joints to which they belong ; these are :— 1. Hip-joint. 2. Knee-joint. 3. Articulations between the tibia'and fibula. 4. Ankle-joint. 5. Articulations of the tarsal bones, 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulations. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal articulations. 8. Articulations of the phalanges. I. HIP-JOINT.—The articulation of the head of the femur with 1 lie acetabulum constitutes an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint.

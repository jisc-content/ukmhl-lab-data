They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve m their course, and anastomose with the superior cerebellar arteries. The branches of the basilar artery are :— Transverse, Superior cerebellar, Posterior cerebral. The transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Varolii and adjacent parts of the brain. One of these branches, larger than the rest, receives the name of anterior inferior cere- bellar artery ; it passes along the crus cerebelli to be distributed to the anterior border of the cerebellum, and anastomoses with the inferior cerebellar of the vertebral. Another small branch of the basilar is known as the auditory artery ; it accompanies the facial and auditory nerves into the meatus auditorius internus, and is distributed to the internal ear. The superior cerebellar arteries, two of the terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are distributed to the upper surface of the cerebellum, inosculating with the inferior cerebellar. 2 C

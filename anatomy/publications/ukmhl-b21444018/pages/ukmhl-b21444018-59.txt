The fusi- lorm cells are united into little ljundles or fasciculi by an adhesi^-e interstitial substance, and the fas- I iculi, which are sometimes round and sometimes flat, are bound to- gether into larger Inindles by are- olar tissue and fine elastic fibres ; the interspaces of the bundles Ijeing occupied by vessels and nerves, the former in great abundance. The fasciculi are connected by tlieir ends with fine tendinous libres, by means of which they l)ecome attached to neighbouring l)arts.

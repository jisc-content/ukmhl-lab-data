NERVE NUCLEI IN FOURTH VENTRICLE. placed above the former. Close to the lateral recesses m the upper portion of the floor are the sensory (outer) and motor inner) nuc ei li the fifth nerve; higher up and nearer the middle hne is the nucleus of the sixth nerve ; deeper down, between the fifth and sixth is the'centre for the seventh nerve. The nuclei of the Fig. 313.â€”Moor of fourth ventricle, showing nu- clei of origin of cranial nerves, a. Pineal body. b. Pulvinar of optic thalamus, c. Anterior corpus quadrigeminus (nates). d. Posterior corpus quadrigeminus (testes). e. Anterior brachium. /. 'Posterior brachium. g. Internal geniculate body. h. Crus cerebri, i. Middle peduncle of crus cere- belli. k.

The nuclei of the cranial nerves are indicated by italic figures, the nerve trunks by Roman nu- merals. eighth or auditory nerve are covered by the tuberculum acusticum and transverse striae. The position of these nuclei will be best understood by reference to Fig. 313. Transverse Section of the Cerebrum. Transverse vertical sections of the cerebrum at different levels are useful for the purpose of ascertaining the relative position of the structures in the interior, and more especially for determining the relation which the two great l)asal ganglia, tlie thalamus opticus and corpus striatum, bear to each other and to surrounding parts. The figure here given (Fig. 314) is taken from a recent section of the

23 BONE. Fig. 35.—Transverse section of a long bone, sliowiiig the Haversian systems, Haversian canals, concentric lamellaj, canaliculi, and lacunai. In recent bones the lacuna3 are occupied by nucleated masses of protoplasm, and the canaliculi by slender threads of the same sul)stance, liy means of which the masses in the lacunae com- municate with one anotlier. The lacunae and their corresponding canaliculi are to be found in all parts of a bone, and in bones howe\'er thin —although Haver- sian canals are only found in those of some thickness. In the periosteal and perimedullary layers of long bones, and in very thin bones, their arrangement has re- ference to the surface of the bone. In cancellous tissue the l)one spicules are devoid of Haversian canals, and the canaliculi open into the cancellous spaces; the latter are occupied by marrow, and hence are named vie- didlary spaces. Lymphatic vessels are found in the periosteum, and in the larger Haversian canals ; ner\ es are distri- ]mf(H\ tn the neriosteum 36.—Lacun* magnified 500 diameters, a. ijurm XO ine peiiosieum, central cavity.

In the modullary cavities of long bones it is found of a pale yellow colour and consists of fine, l)i'anching conneptive tissue corpuscles su])porting fat vesicles ; in the cancellated ends of long bones and in slioi't bones, the bodies of the verteljrae, sternum, and ribs, but es])ecially in the cranial diploii, it is reddish in colour, contains little fat, and is remarkable for the ])resence of a large number of round granular cells reseniljling the white corpuscles of the blood (lymphoid cells), and, like them, being capable of ama^boid movement. Amongst these are smaller cells which hava a faint red colour ; they are nucleated, and resemble the red corpuscles of the blood of the embryo. In both kinds of marrow there are

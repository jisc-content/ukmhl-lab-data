CONNECTIVE TISSUE. 15 flattened, l)nttle, The filn'es of elastic tissue are c}'liudrical or colourless when single, but yellomsh in an aggregated form, elastic, admitting of being stretched to double their length and returning to their original size, and variable in dimensions, ranging from 04000 to joV)o an incli in width. They branch freely, and form communications or anastomoses with each other ; when cut or broken across, they curl up,—this character serving to distinguish them from the white fibres. They are homo- geneous in appearance, and are unaffected by acetic acid. Schwalbe has described numerous ilat connective tissue cells as lying in the ground substance between the fibres of elastic tissue. Isolated elastic fibres of ex- treme fineness are met witli coiled around or entwined among the fasciculi of areolar tissue holding them together. The elastic network formed by these fibres may be extremely fine and delicate, as in thin mem- branes ; or it may be coarser, as in the various ligamentous bands composed of this tissue ; or it may be spread out like a mem- brane, the interstices forming l)nt a small part of its extent, as in the fenestrated memhrane of the arteries. Elastic tissue does not, like fibrous tissue, yield gela- tine on boiling, hwi a peculiar substance called elastin, wliich is insoluble in water, acetic, acid, ammonia, or alcohol. Special Varieties of Con- nective Tissue.—Of these, three kinds deserve special mention, namely, mucous tissue, reti- cular tissue, and simple mem- brane. Mucous Tissue forms the chief part of the umbilical cord (the F[0. 22.—Coarse (o) and fine (6) yellow elas- tic fibres after treatment with strong acetic acid.

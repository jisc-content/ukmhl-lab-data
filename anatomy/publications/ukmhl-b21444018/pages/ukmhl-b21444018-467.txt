OPHTHALMIC AETERY. 395 OrTaital Group, Ocular Group. Lachrymal, Muscular,—anterior ciliary, ■ Supraorbital, Ciliary, sliort and long, Posterior ethmoidal, Arteria centralis retinae. Anterior ethmoidal, Palpebral, Frontal, Nasal. The lachrymal is the first branch of the ophthalmic artery, and is usually given off immediately before that artery enters the optic foramen. It follows the course of the lachrymal nerve, above the FiCr. 254.—Distributiou of the ophthalmic artery, i. Frontal bone. 2. Crista galli. 3. Cribriform plate. 4. Lesser -wing of sphenoid. 5.

The lachrymal artery gives off a malar branch which passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa, and inosculates with the deep temporal arteries, while some of its branches become subcutaneous on the cheek, and anastomose with the transverse facial. The supraorbital artery follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpelira? muscle ; it passes through the supra- orbital foramen, and divides into a superficial aud deep branch, which are distributed to the muscles and integument of the fore-

The transverse or portal fissure is the short and deep fissure, about two inclies in length, through which the hepatic ducts quit and the hepatic artery and portal vein enter the liver. Hence tliis fissure was considered by the older anatomists as the gate of the liver, porta hepatisy and the large vein entering the organ at this point, was named the portal vein. At their entrance into the trans- verse fissure the branches of the hepatic duct are the most anterior, next those of the artery, and most posteriorly the portal vein. Be- sides these three structures, the nerves and lymphatics also enter the liver through this fissure. The fissure for the gall-bladder is a shallow depression extend- ing forwards, parallel with the longitudinal fissure, from the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the free border of the liver, where it frequently forms a notch, incisura vesicalis. The fissure for the vena cava is a deep and short fissure, occa- sionally a circular tunnel, which proceeds from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and'lodges the inferior vena cava. It lies between the Spigelian lobe and the right lobe, and has opening into it the hepa- tic veins, by which the blood leaves the liver. The relative position of these fissures, and the lobes which they limit, will be best understood from the subjoined scheme, for which we are indebted to Prof. D. J. Cunningham :— ( Posterior border ) Left lobe q3 C o Spigelian lobe Transverse fissure Quadrate lobe p.

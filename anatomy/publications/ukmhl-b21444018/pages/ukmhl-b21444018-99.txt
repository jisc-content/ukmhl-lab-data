The ducts are lined by an mveision 0 the epidermis, ^yhich forms a thick and funnel-shaped cone at i s commencement, but soon becomes uniform and ^^^t. Sebaceou glands are met with in all parts of the body, but are most abundant fn the skin of the face, and in those situations which are natuialiy exposed to the influence of friction. . i i The SUDORIFEROUS or SWEAT GLANDS are situated deeply m the corium and also in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, where tliey are surrounded by adipose tissue. They are small round or oblong Ijodies, com- posed of one or more convoluted tubuli, Avliich open into a common efferent duct. The latter ascends from the gland through the derma and epider- mis, and terminates on the surface by a funnel-shaped and oblique aperture or pore. Each gland mass is surrounded by a fine plexus of capillary vessels. The efferent duct presents some variety in its course upwards; within the derma it is straight, or curved and serpentine, and if the epidermis be thin, proceeds more or less directly to the excreting pore. Some- ■ times it is spirally cui'ved within the derma, and having passed the latter, is regularly and Ijeautifully spiral in its passage through the epidermis, the last forming an oblique and valvular opening on the surface. The spiral course of the duct is especially remarkable in the thick epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. On those parts of the skin where the papillae are irregularly dis- tributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriferous glands open on the surface also in-egularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the jjores are situated at regular distances along the ridges, at points corresponding with the intervals of the small.

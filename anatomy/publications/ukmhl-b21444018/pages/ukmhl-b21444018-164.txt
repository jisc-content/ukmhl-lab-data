REGIONS OF THE SKULL. 124 cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves; and farther outwards the lollowing foramina, from before backwards : Hphenoidcd fissure (fora- men lacerum anterius) for the transmission of tlie tliird, fourth, three branches of the ophthahuic division of the fifth, and the sixtli nerve, and ophthalmic vein ; foramen rotundum, for the superior maxillary nerve ; foramen ovale, for the inferior maxillary nerve, lesser meningeal artery, and lesser petrosal nerve; foramen Vesalii for a small vein ; foramen spinosum., for the middle meningeal artery ; foramen lacerum basis cranii (foramen lacerum medium), which is, in the recent state, closed in by fibrous tissue below, and is crossed by the internal carotid artery, carotid plexus, and petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. On the anterior surface of tlie petrous portion of the temporal bone is a groove, leading to a fissured open- "iG. 119.â€”Cerebral surface of the base of the skull. I.

Towards the apex of the petrous portion is the notch for the fifth nerve, and below it a slight depression for the Gasserian ganglion. Farther outwards is the eminence which marks the position of the perpendicular semi-circular canal. Proceeding from the foramen spinosum are two groo^'es, which indicate the course of the trunks of tlie middle meningeal artery. The whole fossa lodges the temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the cerebrum. The fosterior fossa, larger than the other two, is formed by the occipital bone, petrous and mastoid portion of the temporals, and by a small part of the sphenoid and parietals. It is bounded in front by the uppei' border of the petrous portion and dorsum sella?, and

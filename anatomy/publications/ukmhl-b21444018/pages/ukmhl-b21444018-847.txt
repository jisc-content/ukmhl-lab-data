By their bases they are inseparably con- nected with the cor- tex ; tlieir aj^ices, or papilla) (of a paler colour than the rest of the pyramids) project like little teats into the sinns of the kidney, being received into cavi- ties lined with mn- cons membrane and called calices, which are subdivisions of the renal pelvis. The pyramids are com- posed of an assem- blage of straight tubules, the tuhuli recti, which open into a shallow depression on the summit of the papilla, and divide into branches at acute angles as they proceed from the apex to the base of the pyramid ; these cause the radiate striation observable on a vertical section of the pyramids. The cortical portion, distinguished by its bright red colour, granu- hxr appearance, and softer texture, forms the surface of the organ, surrounding the base of each pyramid and penetrating between them to the sinus renalis. It therefore forms septa between the pyramids (sejoia vel columnce Bertini), and marks the original com- position of the kidney of separate lobes. It is com- posed of blood-vessels, with the cortical fasciculi and ultimate terminations of the tubuli uriniferi, liehl to- gether by a delicate stroma of areolar tissue. mi' Fio. 466.—Vertical section of kidney, u.

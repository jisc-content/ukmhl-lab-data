Nerve-supply.—The mylo-hyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior dental, wliich supplies it on its lower or superficial surface. Dissection.—After the mylo-hyoid has been examined, it should be cut away I'rom its origin and insertion, and completely removed. 1 The view of the next muscles would also be improved by dividing the lower jaw a little to the side of the symphysis, and drawing it outwards ; or removing it altogether if the ramus have been already cut across in dissecting the internal pterygoid muscle. The tongue may then be drawn out of the mouth by means of a hook. The GENIO-HYOID {yeufwv, the chin) arises from a small tubercle on the inner skle of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. It is a short and slender muscle,

263 MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE. Sixth Group.—Muscles of the Soft Palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos nvnla^, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. Dissection.—To examine these muscles, the pharynx must be opened from behind by a vertical incision, and the niucous mem- brane carefully re- moved from the pos- terior siu^face of the soft palate. The LEVATOR PALATI, a moderately thick muscle, ariseti 3-^ from the extremity of the petrous iDone in front of the opening of the carotid canal, and from the posterior and inferior aspect of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and passing down by the side of the posterior nares spreads out be- tween the fasciculi of origin of the palato- pliaryngeus ; it is in- serted into the middle line, where it is con- tinuous with the miiscle of the opposite side and is overlaid F^*^" ^QS'—Muscles of the palate.

Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and superior con- strictor muscle ; internally and fosteriorly with the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx and soft palate ; inferiorly it passes between the two fasciculi of origin of the palato-pharyngeus to reach its insertion. Nerve-supply.—Branches from Meckel's ganglion, the motor root of wliich is tlie facial nerve. Dissection.—This muscle must be turned down from its origin on

36 NERVE CELLS. The cell iDrotoplasm is often gi-ainilai', of a liglit bi'own or greyisli colour, and presents traces of striation, such as we noticed in llic axis cylinder of meduUated nerve fibres; not unfrequently it con- tains deiDOsits of brown pigment. No distinct limiting membrane or cell Avail lias been ascertained to exist, but each cell is lodged in a kind of capsule composed of fine connective tissue, and lined by a delicate layer of flattened epithelial cells. The cell processes are composed of protoplasm of the same natui'e as the cell itself ; they also present traces of filu'illation, and are likewise destitute Fio 50 —JIultipolar ganglion cells from the brain, i. A cell, one of -whose processes (a) becomes the axis cylinder of a nerve fibre (6). 2. A cell (a) connected with •mother (6) by means of a commissure (c). 3.

One or more jtroeesses of each nerve cell may be traced into a nerve fibre, becoming continuous with the axis cylinder of the fibre ; other processes become continuous with the "poles" of neighbouring cells. From the fact that nerve cells were first discovered in ganglia, they are often called "ganglion cells ;" the true ganglion cell, however, differs from the cells above described, in respect that the primitive sheath of the nerve fre- quently is continued as a covering over the cell, and in some

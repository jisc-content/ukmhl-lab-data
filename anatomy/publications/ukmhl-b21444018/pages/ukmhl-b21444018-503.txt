SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 423 The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery. They vary from fifteen to twenty in number, and are distributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the ter- mination of the ileum. In their course between the layers of the mesentery, they form a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches ; from these are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches l-iG. 261.â€”C-'oiirse and distribution of the superior mesenteric- artery i.

By means of these arches a direct communication is established between all the branches given oft' from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery; the upper branch inoscuiates with the inferior paiicreatico-duodenal, the lower with the ileo-colic. The ileo-colic artery is the last branch given off by the concavity

The superior border of the nasal surface is irregularly cellular, and articulates with the lachrymal and ethmoid bones; the posterior border is rough, and articulates with the jDalate bone; it is marked by a narrow groove, nearly vertical in direction, which forms j^art of the descending palatine canal; the anterior border is sharp, and forms the free margin of the opening of the nose, and, from the inferior border, projects inwards a strong horizontal j^late, the pialate process. The Antrum of Highmore or maxillary sinus is an irregular four-sided cavity with thin walls ; the outer wall being formed by the facial portion of the bone, the posterior by the zygomatic process, the roof by the orbital j)rocess, and the inner wall by the nasal surface of the bone, the unciform process of the ethmoid, the palate, lacluymal and inferior turbinated.

637 CAVITY OF THE TYMPANUM. MIDDLE EAR OR TYMPANUM. Dissection. In a fresh specimen in wliicli the meatus has been displayed in the manner above described, it is only necessary to remove with bone forceps the roof of the tympanum, taking care to avoid injuring the membrana tympani, chorda tympani nerve, and chain of small bones. The tympanum is an irregular cavity hollowed out in the base of the petrous bone, and placed between the membrana tympani externally and the labyrinth within. It is narrow below and in front, and wider above and behind, and communicates behind with the mastoid cells, internally with the vestibule and scala tympani, and in front by means of the Eustachian tube with the pharynx.

It is described as having a roof (tegmen tympani) and a floor, the former consisting of a thin plate of bone separating the cavity from the middle fossa of the skull, and the latter being formed by the roof of the jugular fossa. The outer wall corresponds through- out greater part of its extent to the membrana tympani and the ring of bone surrounding it; in front of the latter is the irregular slit called fissure of Glaser, which gives passage to the anterior tympanic artery, and in infancy lodges the long ]3rocess of the malleus (processus gracilis); at the inner extremity of this fissure is a small canal (canal of Huguier) which gives passage to the chorda tympani nerve. The inner wall separates the cavity of the tym- panum from the internal ear ; it is rougli and irregular, and is more extensive than the outer wall. It is marked at its upper part by a

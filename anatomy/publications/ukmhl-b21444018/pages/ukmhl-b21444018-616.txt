528 TOPOGRAPHY OF 'J'HE BRAIN. Relations of the Chief Sulci and Convolutions to the Exterior of the Skull. The relations of the sulci and convolutions of the cerebrum t<j the exterior of the skull are of great importance, in consequence of tlie increasing frequency with which operations are now peiformed for the removal of tumours and otlier morbid products from the con- ridge.

Our space will only permit of a brief notice of the chief " landmarks " useful in such operations. The longitudinal fissure corresponds to a line drawn from tlie root of the nose (nasion) to the external occipital j)rotuberance (inion). Fissure of Sylvius.â€”The bifurcation of this fissure corresponds to a point an inch and a quarter behind the external angular process of the frontal and about a quarter of an inch above its lower extre- mity. From this j)oint the vertical portion passes directly u])M'ards for about three-quarters of an inch, running parallel to and imine-

SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. 297 d Tliere are three varieties of oblique inguinal hernia: common, congenital, and infantile. Common obliciue hernia is that which has been described above. Congenital hernia results from the non-closure of the pouch of peritoneum carried downwards into the scrotum by the testicle, uring its descent in the foetus. In consequence of this defect, the intestine at some period of life is forced into the peritoneal canal, and descends through it into the tunica vaginalis, where it lies in contact with the testicle ; so that congenital hernia has 710 proper sac, but is contained within the tunica vaginalis. The other coverings are the same as those of common inguinal hernia. In the female, congenital hernia descends into the canal of Nuck. Infantile hernia is that form of protrusion in which the j^ouch (if pei'itoneum forming the tunica vaginalis is only partially closed. The connection with the alxlomea is completely closed at the inguinal canal, but the rest of the tube remains in its original state, and when a hernia makes its way into the scrotum it lies liehind the en- closed tunica A^aginalis. So that the surgeon, in ojiei'ating upon this variety, requires to divide tlu-ee layers of serous membrane ; the hrst and second layer being those of the tunica vaginalis, the third the true sac of the hernia. A variety of this form is called encysted hernia ; in it, the hernial sac is invaginated into the incompletely closed tunica, as shown 111 Fig. 210. The surgeon has, therefore, to (hvide two layers of peritoneum before he reaches the bowel. , DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA has received its name from passing direct ly through the external abdominal ring, and forcing before ^lo-—Encysted hernia, it the opposing parietes. This portion of the wall of the al>domen is strengthened by the conjoined tendon of the internal oljlique and tensversahs, which is pressed l^efore the hernia, and forms one of Its investments. Its coverings, therefore, are the— Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia, Conjoined tendon, Transversalis fascia, Retro-peritoneal fat, Peritoneal sac. conioiner t^^rW ' 1^ ^"^^'^^^"^^^'^^ of tL resisting nature of the teSncv tn^.

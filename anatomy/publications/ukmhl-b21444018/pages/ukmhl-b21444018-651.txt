SPINAL NERVES. 563 Both divisions are compound—that is to say, they contain both motor and sensory filaments. The SPINAL NERVES are classed as follows :— Cervical 8 pairs Dorsal 12 „ Lumbar . . . . • 5 » Sacral . . . . • 5 » Coccygeal . . . • i » The cervical nerves pass ofi" transversely from the sjiinal cord ; the dorsal are oblique in direction ; the lumbar and sacral, vertical; 1 Flu. 331.—Fart of the cervical portion of tlie .•-piiiai curd, viewed, on its posterior aspect; showing its membranes and the roots of the spinal nerves. i, i. Posterior median fissure. 2, 2. Posterior roots of the cervical nerves; on the opposite side tlie corresponding roots are cut through near their origin. 3, 3. Liga- mentum denticulatum. 4. Spinal accessory nerve, ascending between the posterior roots and ligamentum denticulatum. 5, 5. Dura mater. 6, 6. Openings in the dura mater for the imssar'^ of the roots of the nerve. 7, 7. Ganglia on the posterior roots. 8. Anterior roots. Tlie posterior roots have been cut away in order to show each anterior root proceeding to join the nerve beyond the ganglion.

Point of Exit of the Spinal Nerves.—The roots of the spinal nerves run obliquely downwards from the part of the cord from which each springs to the intervertebral foramen by which it emerges from the canal. The degree of obliquity varies in difterent regions, being greatest in the lumbar and sacral nerves, and least in the dorsal. The following table from A. Macalister's Text-Book of

Its branches of distribution are the short ciliary nerves, whicli arise from its anterior angles in two groups ; the upper group con- sisting of about four filaments ; the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into filaments which pierce the sclerotic around the optic nerve to supply Fio. 345.â€”Cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, i.

Its branches of communication are three : one, the long root, proceeds from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and joins its superior angle ; a short and thick branch, the short root, from the inferior division of the third nerve to its inferior angle ; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, from the cavernous j^lexus, which accompanies the long root to the ganglion. Occasionally the ophthalmic ganglion receives also a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion ; and sometimes from the abduceiis nerve.

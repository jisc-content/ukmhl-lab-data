259 MFSGLES OF THE PHARYNX. Fifth Group.—Muscles of the Pharynx. Inferior constrictor, Middle constrictor, Snjierior constrictor. Stylo-pliaryngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. IB Dissection.—To dissect the pharynx, the trachea and oesophagus are to be cut through at the lower part of the neck, and drawn upwards by dividing the loose areolar tissue which connects the back of the pharynx with the vertebral column. The saw is then to be applied behind the styloid processes, and the base of the skull sawni through. The vessels and loose structures should be removed Fir,. 191.—Dissection of the constrictor mus- cles of the pharynx with the vessels and nerves in relation with them. i.

Fascia.—Tlie pharyngeal fascia or aponeurosis is a strong sheet situated ijetween the muscles and mucous membrane ; it is especialh- strong at its upper part, where it fills in the interval left above the lestooned upper margin of the superior constrictor, and is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone and petrous portion of the lemporal. It is strengthened in the middle line by a strong band vliicii IS attached to the pharyngeal tubercle on the basilar i)rocess ot the occipital bone ; this lias been named by Cleland the cranio- 20.

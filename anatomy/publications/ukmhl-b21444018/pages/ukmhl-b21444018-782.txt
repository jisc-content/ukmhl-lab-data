694 MEDIASTINA. The middle mediastinum contains the heart enclosed in its peri- cardium, the ascending aorta, superior vena cava, pulmonary arteries and veins, bifurcation of tlie trachea, and phrenic nerves with their accompanying vessels. With the exception of the tracliea and phrenic nerves, the whole of the contents of this space lie within the pericardium. The posterior mediastinum is bounded behind by the vertebral column, m front by the pericardium, and at each side by the pleura It contains the thoracic aorta, the greater and lesser azygos veins and superior intercostal veins, the thoracic duct, esophagus and pneumogastric nerves, the great splanchnic nerves, and some lym- phatic glands. superior mediastinum is the part of the interpleural space which lies above the pericardium, and is bounded in front by the Fig. 407.—Transverse section of the tliorax. i.

It is bounded bdoio hy a plane passing from the junction of the first and second jiieces of the sternum to the lower edge of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra. It contains the remains of the thymus gland, the pneumogastric, cardiac, phrenic, and left recurrent laryngeal nerves ; the trachea, (esophagus, and tlioracic duct; the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and its three great branches ; the superior intercostal veins ;

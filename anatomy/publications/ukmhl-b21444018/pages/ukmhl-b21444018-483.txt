The posterior circumflex and alar thoracic branches are seen in the fig\ire between the in- ferior thoi-acic and subscapiilai*. The anterior circumflex is observed between the two heads of the biceps, crossing the neck of thehumer\is. 15. Superior pro- funda. 16. Inferior profunda. 17. Anas- toraotica magna inosculating iuferiorly with the anterior ulnar recurrent. 18. Termination of the superior profunda, inosculating with the radial recuiTent in the interspace between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus. and alar thoracic below tlie pectoralis minor ; and the three re- maining branches below the lower border of the subscapularis. The superior thoracic (short thoracic), the highest of the branches ot the axillary, and sometimes derived from the next, passes inwards to the chest in front of the pectoralis minor muscle, and is distri-

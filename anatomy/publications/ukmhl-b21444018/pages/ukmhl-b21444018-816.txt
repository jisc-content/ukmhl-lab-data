SMALL INTESTINES. 728 The duodenum (called 8(o8fKaddKTv\ov by Herophilus), larger and more dee^jly seated than the rest of the small intestine, has received Its name from Ijeing about equal in length to the Ijreadth of tweh'e fingers (eight or ten inches). In its course it presents a horse-slioe curve; commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the under surface of the liver ; it next descends 2'>erpendicularly in front of the right kidney as low as the fourth lumbar vertebra, and then passes nearly transversely across the tliird lumbar vertebra ; terminating in the_ jejunum at the left side of tlie second lumlmr vertebra, whei'e it is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and Fig. 43g.â€”View of part of the abdominal viscera, showing the relations of the pancreas and duodenum, p.

The duodenum is the most fixed portion of the small in^testine. The first or ascending portion of its course, betAveen two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by the peritoneum: it is in relation, above with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder; in front with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and behind Avith the right l)OT'der of the lesser omentum and its vessels. The second or descending portion is situated altogether behind the peritoneum : it is in relation by its anterior surface with the commencement of the arcli of tlie colon ; by its iiosterior .surface with the concave margin of the right kidney, the inferior vena cava, and common l)ile duct; by its right border with tlie ascending colon ; and l)y its left border witli tlie pancreas.

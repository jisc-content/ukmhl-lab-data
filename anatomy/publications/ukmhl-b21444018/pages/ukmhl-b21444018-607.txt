FOUETH VENTEICLE. white centre is composed of nieduUated nerve-fibres, some of which are (i) commissural between the two hemisj)heres of the cerebellum, others (2) are association fibres between difterent folia, and (3) other filires spring from the central nnclei above descril^ed. Fourth Ventricle. Dissection. — An oblique incision must be made through each half of the cerebellum, and the wedge-shaped intervening mass removed ; the mem- branes covering the back part of the medulla and pons must be carefully cleared away, when the fourth ventricle will be displayed. The fourth ventricle is the remains of the posterior cerel^ral vesicle of the embryo, and is situated between the cerebellum and the posterior surface of the medulla and pons ; it is diamond- shaped, with narrow angles directed Fig. 310.—m.

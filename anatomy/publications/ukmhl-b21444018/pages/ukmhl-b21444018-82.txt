Body of the gland. part are occupied by the projier glandular or adenoid tissue, which in t he former takes the shape of oval masses (follicles), and in the lattei- that of cords or cylinders (medullary cylinders). In both corte.\ and medulla the gland pulp or substance is .separated fi-om the trabeculue forming alveoli and meshes by a space of neai-ly uniform widtli throughout; this is the lymph sinus or lymijh path. It is not empty, but is occupied by I'etifoi-m connecti\'e tissue, that is to say, ramilied or anastomosing cells ; these support large numbers of lvni]jh corpuscles, which are cari-ied onwards by the current of lymph. The lymphoid tissue which forms the great mass of the u'land, consists of a I'eticuluui of line homogeneous fibrils or mem-

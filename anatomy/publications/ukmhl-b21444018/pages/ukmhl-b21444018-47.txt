19 BONE. elastic fibro-cartilage are, the pinna, ej^iglottis, cornicula laiyngis, cuneiform cartilages, and Eustachian tube. White Fibro-Cartilage is comj)osecl of an interlacement of fibres of white fibrous tissue, containing in its meshes scattered groups of cai'tilage cells which take the place of, and sometimes have a similar arrangement to the tendon-cells described above. Fibro-cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups : inter- ai'ticular, stratiform, connecting, and circumferential. Instances of interarticular fibro-cartilages (menisci) are those of the lower jaAV, sternal and acromial end of the clavicle, wrist, and knee. The strati- form fibro-cartilages are such as form a thin coating to the grooves on bone through which tendons play. The connecting fibro-cartilages are the intervertebi'al substance and cartilage of the symphysis pubis. The circumferential fibro-cartilages are the glenoid and cotyloid. The invertebral discs are soft and pulpy in the centre, but firm and dense at their circumference ; the cartilage cells are sparsely distriljuted, but increase in number in the inner layers ; the pulp itself, however, usually contains no cartilage cells, but consists of a cell structure, embedded in a soft matrix, and is the remains of the chorda dorsalis of the embryo. Fici. 30.—White fibro-cartilage, showing cells (a) in capsules, and fibrillar matrix (6). Cartilages, excepting those of joints, have their free surfaces covered by a fibrous membrane called the perichondrium. Cartilage yields on Vjoiling a substance called chondrin, similar to gelatine, but differing from it in not being precipitated by tannic acid. BONE. Bone is composed of alwut one-tliird of animal substance, which is almost conipletely reducible to gelatine Ijy boiling, and two-thirds of eartliy and alkaline salts. The special constituents of bone are pre- sent m the following proportions :—

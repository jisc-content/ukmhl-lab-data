PORTAL SYSTEM. 472 The splenic vein couuneuces in the structure of the spleen, and quits that organ Ijy five or six large l)ranches, which soon unite to tonn a single trunk ; it is larger than the splenic artery, and perfectly straight in its course. It passes horizontally inwards behind the pancreas, and terminates near its greater end by uniting with the superior mesenteric and forming the portal vein.. It receives in its course the vasa brevia, left gastro-epiploic, pancreatico-duodenal, and Fto. 284.â€”The portal vein. i.

The gastric veins for the most part take tlie course of the cor- responding arteries, those of the large end of the stomach tei-minat- ing in the splenic A^ein, and the right gastro-epiploic in the superior mesenteric. Those along the lesser curvature are, however, difFer- ently arranged to the artei'ies ; they are two in numlier, and receive

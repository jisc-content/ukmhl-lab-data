lOI SPHENOID BONE. {carotico-cUnoid) by a spicule of bone uniting the anterior and middle clinoid processes. Behind the olivary process is the sella turcica, the deep fossa which lodges the ^^ituitary gland and circiilai- sinus ; behind and somewhat overhanging the sella turcica, is a broad rough plate, dorsum sella:, bounded at each angle by a tubercle, the 2)nsterior clinoid processes; and behind tliis plate an inclined surface (clivus Blumenbachii), which is continuous with the basilar jDrocess of the occipital bone, and sujDports the Pons Varolii. On each side of the sella turcica is a broad groove {carotid or cavernous yroove); it is bounded externally at its back part by a well-marked ridge called the lingula sphenoidalis. The carotid groove lodges the internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus, orbital nerves, and cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. Opposite the middle of the sella tiircica the Fio. 105.—Superior or cere- bral surface of the sphen- oid bone. I. Olivary pro- cess. 2. Ethmoidal spine. 3. Lesser wing of the left side. 4.

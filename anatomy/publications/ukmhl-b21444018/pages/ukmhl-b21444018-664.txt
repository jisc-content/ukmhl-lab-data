576 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 17^ Tlie muscular branches are distrilnited to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. The cutaneous branches are three in number, internal and two external. The in- ternal branch arLses from the nerve in the axilla, and pierc- ing the deep fascia in the ujjper third of the arm on its pos- terior aspect, com- municates with tlie intercosto - humeral nerve, and is distri- buted to the integu- ment of the posterior aspect of the upper arm, as far as the olecranon. The external cuta- neous branches pas? through the sub- stance of the external head of the triceps, and pierce the deep fascia; one, wpiw. near the insertion of the deltoid, tlie other, lower, at about the middle of the upper arm. The upper branch follows the course of the cephalic vein, sup- plying the integu- ment of the outer and fore-part of the upper arm as far as the bend of the elbow. The loioer branch passes down the outer side of the forearm, reaches the posterior aspect at about its middle, and is continued on- wards to the wrist, where it comuiunicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous.

KIDNEYS. 76o Unniferous tubules—The kidney is a compound tubular eland, rts secreting structure being formed by the uriniferous tulniles. These commence by spherical dilatations, the Malpighian capsules, m the labyrinth of the cortex, each capsule enclosing a tuft of U jood um Pig. 467.—On the left of the figure the arrangement of tlie blood-vessels of tlic kidney is shown, on the right the course oi the minifernns tubules, vs. Vena> stellulpe. vi.

Tlie tubule, on issuing from the capsule, is constricted by a narrow neck, then -widens out and becomes convoluted, forming the first convoluted tubule; next it passes towards one of the pyramids of tlie medulla, becoming

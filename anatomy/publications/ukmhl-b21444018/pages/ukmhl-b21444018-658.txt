BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 570 Tlie anterior thoracic nerves, two in number, proceed, one trom the external cord of tlie plexus, the other from the internal cord. The former, the external or superficial branch, crosses the axillary artery in the space above the pectoralis minor to the front of the chest, and is distributed to the pectoralis major muscle.

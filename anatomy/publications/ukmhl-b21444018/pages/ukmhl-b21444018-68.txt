NERVE TERMINATIONS. 40 neck, fU'ni, and leg, and dorsum of the hand and foot, infraorhital nerve, and on the nerves of the periosteum, nipple, and mamma, and those distributed to joints. It has been calculated that in the palm oi the hand and ]ialmar surface of the fingers thei-e are six hundred of these bodies, and at the extremities of the fingers thev are especially numerous. They are situated for the most part in tlie subcutaneous areolar tissue, are clear, ti'anspai'ent, and glistening in appearance, and traversed intei-nally witli white streaks. In struc- ture a Pacinian l)ody is composed of from twenty to sixty concentric layers or capsules of areolar tissue, separated by spaces containing lymph, and having a central cavity also filled with lymjih whicli contains the free extremity of a nerve fibre, divested of its sheath and medulla and reduced to the condition of a'n axis cylinder. Tlie intercaj^sular spaces are wider between the external than the internal layers, and each cajisule is lined by a single layer of squamous epitbelial cells ; neighbouring capsules are often branched and connected with each other by fibres. The central stalk of the corpuscle consists of the medullated nerve fibre entering it, and the sheath of the nerve may be ti-aced into the outer layers of the capsule. The axis cylinder included within the central cavity ends

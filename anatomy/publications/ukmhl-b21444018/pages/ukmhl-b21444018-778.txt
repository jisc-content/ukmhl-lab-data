Columnar ciliated epithelium. The bronchial tubes continue to diminish in size until they attain a diameter of one millimetre, when they become changed in structure, and are continued onwards in tlie midst of air-cells, under the name of alveolar passages. These passages divide into smaller ones, which teiininate by some- what dilated extremities, called infun- dibula, the walls of which are every- where crowded by hemisiDlierical saccult> called alveoli or air cells. The muscular fibres of the bron- chioles are non-striated ; they are ar- I'anged in rings around the tube, and form a muscular coat Avhich is jjlaced internally to the cartilaginous plate^; uie dilatation of the ultimate and is continued as far as the plates bronchial tubes into ai^^^^^^^^ theniselves.

FCETAL CIRCULATION. 673 by the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein passes through the umbilicus and enters the liver, where it divides into several branches ; two or three of these branches are distri- buted to the left lobe, one branch communi- cates with the portal vein in the transverse fissure and supplies the right lobe, and a large branch, the duc- tus venosus, passes directly backwards and joins the inferior vena cava. In the inferior cava the j)ure blood becomes mixed with that which is returning from the lower extre- mities and abdominal ^dscera, and is carried through the right auricle (guided by the Eustachian valve) and through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed by means of the carotid and sub- clavian arteries, princi- pally to the head and upper extremities. From the head and upper extremities the impure l)lood is re- turned by the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle it is propelled into the right ventricle, and from the right ventricle into the pul- monary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be circulated through the lungs and oxygenated, but in the fcctus the lungs are solid and almost impervious. Only a small quantity of blood passes therefore into tlie lungs, the greater part courses through the ductus arteriosus into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mingled with a very small portion of the pure blood derived from the left ventricle. 2 u • Fig. 391.—Fcetal circulation, a.

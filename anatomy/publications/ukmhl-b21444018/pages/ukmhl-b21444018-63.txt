35 NEEVE CELLS. primitive filirillfc. Non-iiiedullated fibres may thus be I'egarded ;is medullated Hbres devoid of a medullary sheath. NERVE CELLS.—These are found in the grey matter of the In-ain and spinal cord, and in the rcrebro-spinal and sympathetic ganglia. They are uf various shapes and sizes. Some in the gre}' matter of the cortex of the Ijrain, in the posterior liorn of the gi'ey centre of tlie spinal cord, and ill certain ganglia, are spheroidal, and of very small -ize. The majority of the nerve cells ai'e, however, distinguished by jjossessing processes or "poles" hy means of which they become connected "wdth each other, and with the nerve fibres passing into the grey centres. A few of the cells jiossess only I me process, and are called unipolar, others have two processes, and are called bipolar, but the greater luunber have many processes which bi-anch and form elaborate connections ^T^t\\ neighbouring cells Fio. 48.—Gelatinous nerve fibres from olfactory nerve. ;ind nerve fibres ; they are named onultipolar cells. Many of the nerve cells found in the surface grey matter of the brain are triangular in shape, having their bases directed towards the centre of the brain, and their apices towards the free surface ; from their angles they give oft" Fio. 49.—Multipolar cells from the anterior grey column of the spinal cord of the dog-fi.sh (a) lying in a texture of fibrils ; (b) prolongation from cells • (c) nerve-fibres cut acros.s. fine processes. Nerve cells vary in size from ^-ooo ^ rrhj of an inch in width ; they have each one or more clear transpa?'ent nuclei, in the centre of each of which a nucleolus is visible.

The popliteal artery lies at the bottom of this space, immediately in contact with the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, the vein lying superficial to it, and the internal popliteal nerve superficial to both vein and artery; the external popliteal nerve (perineal) descends on the outer side of the space, in contact with the biceps tendon, and the lymphatic glands (four or five in number) surround the artery. POPLITEAL ARTERY. The pojiliteal artery (Fig. 269) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. In structure the popliteal artery is remarkable for the thickness of its walls. Plan of the Relations of the Popliteal Artery. Superficially. Semi-membranosus, Popliteal nerve, Popliteal vein.

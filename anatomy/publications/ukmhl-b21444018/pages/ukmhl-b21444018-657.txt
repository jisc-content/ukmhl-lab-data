BEACHIAL PLEXUS. 569 lower down it is placed between the clavicle and subclavius muscle above, and the first rib and first serration of the serratus magnus muscle below. In the axilla, it is situated at first to the outer side of and then behind the axillary artery, resting by its outer border against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Lower down it completely surrounds the artery. The branches of the brachial plexus are: from the outer cord, one of the anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median ; from the inner cord, the other anterior thoracic nerve, inner head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous of Wrisberg, and ulnar ; from the posterior cord, the subscapular nerves, circumflex, and musculo-sjDiral. Besides these, the brachial plexus, while in the neck, gives off several superior muscular branches: one to the subclavius muscle, Fig. 333.â€”Nerves forming the bra- chiiil plexus.

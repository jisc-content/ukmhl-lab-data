292 'MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. the Imese transversse, wliero a close adhesion exists between the muscle and the external wall of the sheath. The RECTUS ABDOMINIS arises by a double tendon from the iront and crest of the os pubis, and is inserted by three broad digitations into the outer surfaces of the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. It is traversed by several tendinous in- tersections, called linese transversse (inscriptiones tendineaj). One of these is situated at the umbilicus, one over the ensiform cartilage, Fr:. 204.—Transverse section through the abdominal walls, showing the arrangement of muscles and tendons, i. A lumbar vertebra. 2. Psoas magnus muscle. 3. Quad- I'atus lumborum. 4. Erector spinse. 5. Lumbar aponeurosis. 6. Latissimus dor.^i. Between 5 and 6 the serratus posticus inferior is seen. 7. E.^ternal oblique. 8. Internal oblique. 9. Transversalis. 10. Rectus abdominis. 11. Insertion of the luuibar aponeurosis into the spine of the lumbar vertebra. 12. Lumbar aponeurosis dividing into three layers. 13. The figure is placed on the qu.adratiis lumboium, and has above it the anterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis, .ind below it the middle layer. 14. Peritoneum where it covers the kidney. 15. Show.s the mode of union of the tendons in the formation of the sheath of the rectiis. and one midway between these i)oints ; when a fourth exists, it occurs l)elow the umbilicus. They frequently do not involve tlic whole thickness of the muscle. Nerve-supply.—The ilio-hypogastric and anterior l)ranclies oi intercostal nerves. The PYRAMIDALIS arises from the crest of the os pubis in front of the rectus, and is inserted into the linea all)a at aliout mid- way between the umbilicus and pul)es. It is enclosed in the sheath Avith the rectus, and rests against the lower part of that muscle; ii is .sometimes absent.

STEUCTURE OF THE UTERUS. 789 uterus, extending from the fundus to about tlie lower third, where it is reflected on to the bladder, forming the redo-vesical fold. On the posterior aspect it not only covers the whole surface of the uterus, but passes on to the posterior vaginal wall for rather more than an inch, and from thence is continued to the rectum, forming the recto-vaginal pouch or space of Douglas. In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly dense in texture, ofl'ers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uterus the fibres are of large size, distinct, and separable into three layers -. external, which are longitudinal and transverse, the former constituting a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surface and fundus of the organ, the latter being prolonged outwards on the Fallopian tubes, and into the round and ovarian ligaments ; middle, a tliick layer Fig. 487.â€”Uterus with its appendages viewed from the front, i.

The muscular tissue of the uterus is of the unstriped variety, and consists of long, nucleated, fibre cells, mixed with a con- siderable f[uantity of areolar tissue in which are many nucleated cells. The mucous membrane, of a whitish or pale red colour, is closely connected, or more correctly, is blended with the muscular coat; it is characterised by possessing a very thick layer of muscularis mucosae, a ciliated epithelium, and a number of tubular glands.

PART VI. NEUROLOGY. The nervous system consists of large masses of nerve matter forming the cerebro-spinal axis, of lesser centres called ganglia, of the peri- pheral nerves, and, lastly, of certain modifications of the latter constituting the organs of sense. THE CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. The mass of nerve matter forming the cerebro-spinal axis is con- tained in the cavity of the cranium and vertebral canal; it is divided into two partsâ€”the encephalon or brain and the spinal cord ; each lateral half of these centres corresponds accurately with the other half, the two parts being joined together by connecting bands of nerve tissue called commissures. The brain, contained in the cranium, and the spinal cord occupying the vertebral canal, are (protected by the osseous walls of those cavities, and are also sur- ; rounded by meninges or membranes which support them and 1 convey to their substance the vessels necessary for their nutrition. ] The great centres of the cerebro-spinal nervous system are most i easily u.nderstood by taking them up in the following order : spinal ) cord, medulla oblongata, jjons Varolii, cerebrum, and cerebellum. SPINAL CORD. The spinal cord of the adult, from fifteen to eighteen inches in : length, extends from the foramen magmim to opposite the lowej- border of the body of the first or upper border of the second lumbar : vertebra, where it tapers to a conical point {conus medullaris), ; from which is continued downwards a slender cord, the Jilum i terminale. In the child, at birth, the cone reaches the middle of the third lumbar vertebra, and in the embryo is prolonged as far as the (lower part of the sacral canal. When stripped of its membranes and nerves the cord weighs from i oz. to if oz. ; its proportion to the weight of the encephalon is as i to 33. The cord presents a lifFerence of diameter in different parts of its extent, and has two 485 I

GENERAL CHARACTERS OF BONES. _ Bones are divisible into four classes:—Long, flat, short, and irregular. Tlu- long boiR's are found princiiially in the limhs, and consist of a shatt and two extremities. Tlie shaft is cylindrical or prismoid m torin, dense and hard in texture, and hollowed in the interior into a medullary ('anal. The extremities are broad and expanded to aiticulate with adjoining l)ones ; and are cancellous in internal

VEINS OF THE DIPLOE. 452 VEINS OF THE DIPLOE. The diploci of the bones of the head is furnished in the adult with irregular sinuses (vence difloeticai), which are formed by a continua- tion of the internal coat of the veins into the osseous canals in which they are lodged. At the middle period of life these sinuses are confined to separate bones ; but in old age, after the ossification of the sutures, they may be traced from one bone to the next. They receive their blood from the capillaries supplying the cellular struc- ture of the dij^loe, and terminate externally in the veins of the pericranium, internally in the veins and sinuses of the dura mater ; they are separated from the bony walls of the canals by a thin layer of marrow. Four of these dijiloetic veins can be generally distinguished, namely, frontal, anterior temporal, posterior temporal, and occipital. The frontal, the smallest of the four, escapes from the frontal bone at Fig. 274.—The external table of the skull removed to show the vehis of the cranial diploe. the supraorbital notch, and opens into the supraorbital vein. The anterior temporal also collects the blood from the frontal bone, and terminates either in the deep temporal veins or in the cavernous sinus, by passing throiigh an opening in the great wing of the sphenoid. The posterior temporal commences in the parietal bone, and opens through an aperture in that bone into the lateral sinus, sometimes sending a branch outwards to the veins of the scalp. The occipital, the largest of the four, originates in the occipital bone, and terminates internally in the torcular Herophili or lateral sinus, or externally in the occipital vein. Emissary Veins.—These are small veins which pass through the walls of the skull and establish communications between the sinuses and the veins on the exterior of the skull; they are large in the young child, but small and inconstant in the adult. The chief emissary vein are as follows:—(i) A mastoid bi-anch, passing

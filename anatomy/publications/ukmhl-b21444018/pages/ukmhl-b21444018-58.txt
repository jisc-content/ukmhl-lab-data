Under a high microscopii; ])ower numerous nuclei mav he observed beneath the sarcolemma ; they are more distinctly visible in fcrtal muscle, but can also be traced in that of adult life liy the addition oi a weak acid. They frequently contain nucleoli, and thei-e is littlo doubt that they are the nuclei of the cells from which the musdi- was develo]ied. A transverse section of a muscular til^'e when exa- mined under a high power, appears to be marked out into vci v Fia.43.—Portion of asti-iatedhumaumus- Fig. 44.—Non-stnated muscular cular fibre, showing Dobie's line in the fibres from mesentery of newt, middle of the clear band (S/iarjJcy). minute polygonal portions, bounded bv white lines (polygonal areo- of Cohnlieim) ; they are believed to ue due to groupings of the ultimate fibrillaj of the muscle. Various explanations of the transverse markings in striated muscle have from time to time been i)roi30unded, l)ut none has hitherto met with general acceptance. Striped muscular fibres usually neither divide nor anastonio;-e. but an exception to this rule is found in the muscles of the tongn. and of the heart, which do l)oth. The Hl)res of the facial muscle- also, where tliey are attaciied to the skin, frequently branch.

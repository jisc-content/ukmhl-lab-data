TRANSVERSE SECTION OF CEREBRUM. 522 brain, wliicli has been made immediately behind the corpora albi- cantia ; it passes tliroiigh the hiteral and third ventricles, the middle horn of the lateral ventricles, island of Reil, thalamus opticus, fornix, and corpus striatum. The latter is now seen to Ije a composite body made up of several independent nuclei; its full description is as follows. The corpora striata are two pyriform bodies placed with their broad ends forwards and their narrow ends Imckwai'ds. They are throughoiit the greater part of their extent embedded in the sul)- FiG. 314.â€”Transverse vertical sectiou of the cerebrum made immediately behind the corpora albicantia. i.

The intraventricular portion is named nucleus caudatus ; its large end, or head, is directed forwards and projects into the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle ; its smaller end or tail runs on the outer side of the thalamus, and narrowing as it pro- ceeds backwards, terminates by a pointed end m the roof of the descending horn. The extraventricular portion lies to the outer side of the optic thalamus, and between it and the island ot Keil;

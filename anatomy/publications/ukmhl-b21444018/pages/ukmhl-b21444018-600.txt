CEREBRUM. 512 the posterior will be found incorporated with the white layer be- neath, which is the foi'uix. Fornix.—Tlie fornix (arch) is an arched band of white substance, placed in the floor of tlie lateral ventricle, and intimately connected posteriorly with the nndei' surface of the corpus callosuni. It con- sists of two lateral halves which unite in tlie middle of the lateral ventricle forming the body, Imt diverge from each other posteriorly as the ])osterior ijillars or crura., and anteriorly as the anterior pillan or crura. The two anterior crura descend in a curved direction to the base of the brain, embedded in the anterior ]iart of the Fig. 306.—Vertical longitudinal section of the brain, i. Marginal convolution. 2.

At the base of the brain they make a sudden c^r^■e upon themselves and constitute the corpora albicantia, from which they may be traced upwards to the thalami optici. Opening trans- versely beneath these two crura, just as they are about to arch down- wards, is the foramen of communication between the lateral and the third ventricle, the foramen of Monro ; or foramen commune anterii^. The choroid plexuses and the veins of the corpora striata pass through this opening. The lateral thin edges of the fornix are continuous posteriorly with the concave border of the hippocampus major at each sidt-

237 ACTIONS OF THE OEBITAL MUSCLES. space between these forms a lymph-space which is contmiious with the space between the inner and outer sheath of the optic nerve Actions—The levator palpebrse raises the upper eyelid, ihe four recti, acting singly, pull the eyeball in the four directions— upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards. Acting by pairs, they carry the eyeball in the diagonal of these directions, viz., upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and in- wards, downwards and outwards. Acting all together, they directly retract the glo^be within the orbit. The superior oblique muscle, acting alone, rolls the globe inwards and forwards, and carries the Fig. 184.—Section of right orbit seen from the front, and. showing orbital contents and caiisule of Tenon, i.

The inferior oblique, acting alone, rolls the globe outwards and backwards, and carries the pupil outwards and upwards to the upper and outer angle of the eye. The superior rectus when acting alone tends not only to raise the eyeball, but also to carry it inwards, and rotate it slightly on its own axis ; this tendency to iuA'ersion and rotation is corrected Ijy the combination of that muscle with the inferior oblique, the latter tending to direct the pupil outwards and to rotate the ball in the opposite direction to the rectus. In like manner the inferior rectus and superior oblique are combined in

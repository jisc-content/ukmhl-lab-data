It is provided with a stratified squamous epithelium corresponding with that of the bladder, and has opening on to its surface numerous mucous recesses or crypts, and the ducts of the glands lying in the submucous tissue. The submucous coat is loose, and contains a convoluted vascular structure resembling erec- tile tissue ; it also contains numei'ous racemose mucous glands, which 21 Fig. 477.â€”Longitudinal section of the bladder, prostate gland, and penis, showing the urethra, i.

A slight ridge, formed by the muscle of the ureter, and ex- tending from the tei'miuation of the ureter to the commencement of the urethra. This ridge forms the lateral boundary of the trigonum vesicte. 5. Coinmencement of the urethra; the elevation of mucous membrane immediately below the figure is the uvula vesicas. The constriction of the bladder at this point is the neck of the bladder. 6. Prostatic portion of the urethra. 7. Prostate gland; the differ- ence of thickness of the gland above and below the urethra is shown. 8.

Near the upper part of the corpus cavernosum, the section has fallen a little to the left of the middle line ; a portion of the septum pectiniforme is consequently seen.

The glands are mo.st abundant along the floor of the urethra, espe- cially in the bulbous portion. The muscular coat consists of unstriped muscular fibres, the outer layer of wliich is arranged circularly and is continuous with the circular muscular layer of the bladder ; the inner layer is longitudinal. The urethra is about eight inches in length, and divided into a prostatic, membranous, and spongij portion.

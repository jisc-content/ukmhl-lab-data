CEREBRUM. 498 callosum will be seen descending to the base of the brain. Arrived at the base of the brain, the corpus callosum terminates by a concave border, which is prolonged to the commissure of the optic nerves by a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cmerea. The lamina cinerea is the anterior pai't of the inferior Ijoundary of the third ventricle. On each side of the lamina cinerea the corpus callosum is continued backwards and outwards as a broad white band, these being called the peduncles of the corpus callosum ; they cross the 2 i Fi«. 298.—Thebase of the brain, i.

On the under surface of each anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, is the olfactory nerve, with its bu.lb. The fissure of Sylvius bounds the frontal lobe posteriorly, and separates it from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe ; it lodges the middle cerebral artery. The substantia perforata (locus perforates anticus) is a triangu- lar surface coated with grey matter, situated at the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named perforata from being pierced by a number of openings for the medullary branches of the middle i

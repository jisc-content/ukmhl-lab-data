Tlie third portion of the artery is situated in the subclavian tri- angle, and is more superficial than the rest. Plan of the Relations of the Third Portion of the Subclavian Artery. Above.

Three are given oft' by the first portion of the artery ; one, the superior intercostal, by the second jjortion; ^vhen a fifth artery exists, it arises from the third portion, and is the ] insterior scapular. So frecruent is the occurrence of this variation, tliat many anatomists consider it to be the normal condition. In a taljular form the branches are as follows :— Vertebral, Internal mammary, !Inferior thyroid, Suprascapular, or transversalis humeri, Transversalis colli. Superior intercostal,—Deep cervical. The VERTEBRAL ARTERY, the first and largest of the branches of the subclavian artery, arises from the posterior aspect of that trunk ; it ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebrae, excepting the last; then winds back- wards around the articulating process of the atlas; and, piercing

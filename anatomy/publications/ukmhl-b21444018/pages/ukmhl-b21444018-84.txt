On entering a gland the lym- phatic vessel loses all its coats except the innei- endothelial one, which is continued over the trabecula), forniing a delicate lining foi these partitions. The lymphatic glands above described are sometimes .spoken ot as coiiifoimd lymphatic glands, to distinguish them from masses oi' lymphoid tissue found in various parts of the body, and described as simple li/viphatic glands. Examples of the latter are the tonsils, glands at the root of the tongue, thymus gland, solitary and agrainalc glands of the intestine, and the Malpighian bodies of the .spleen. These will be described in the section on the vi-scera, in connection with the organs of which the adenoid masses form a ])a]'t. SEROUS MEMBRANES. These occur in the form of a thin transparent web which lines the interior of cavities containing viscera, and is so disposed as to facili- tate movement. The chief examples are the pleurte and pericardium in the chest, peritoneum in the abdomen, arachnoid in the cranium and spinal canal, and the tunica vaginalis in front of the testicle. A serous membrane consists of two parts, one which lines the cavity, called the parietal layer ; the PiQ. 6g. —Plan of a other, which is reflected from membrane. ^^^(^%^ the wall of the cavitv, and 1.

The sei'ous membranes are all closed .sacs, retaining their fluid contents when from any cause there is an abnormal effusion. The only exception to this is the peritoneum in the female, where at the extremity of the Falloi)ian tube tlu; serous membrane is continuous with the miicous lining of the tube. In some cases, as the serous membrane of the heart and lungs, its arrangement is very simple ; in others, as the pei-itoneum, it is very complex, owing to the number of organs contained in the cavity : but in all (except the arachnoid) the two layers can easily be madi' out. At the place where the reflection takes place, the vessels of the contained organ enter it. The viscus, although said to be sni'- rounded by the serous membrane, is in reality outside of it. Tlif accompanying plan of such a sac will give an idea of the manner of arrangement. Structure.—Serous membranes are lined by a layer of flattened

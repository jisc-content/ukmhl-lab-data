MUSCLES OF THE EAR. 635 upper margin of tlie fibro-cartilage of tlie tragus to tlie helix, and completes the meatus. The proper muscles of the pinna are the— Major lielicis, Minor helicis, Tragicus, Antitragicus. Transversus auriculse, Obliquus auris. The major helicis is a narrow band of muscular fibres situated on the anterior border of the helix. It arises from the spine of the heKx, and is inserted into the anterior border of that fold. The minor helicis is placed upon the anterior extremity (crus) of the helix, at its commence- ment in the fossa of the concha. The tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situ- ated on the tragus, and having a vertical direc- tion. The antitragicus arises from the antitra- gus, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the processus caudatus of the helix. The transversus auriculae, partly ten- dinous and partly mus- cular, extends trans- ^versely from the con- vexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the j)inna. The obliquus auris (Tod) is a small band of fibres passing between the upper part of the convexity of the concha and the convexity immediately above it. Dissection.—In the recent temporal bone the external auditory meatus may be examined by cutting away with the saw the squamous portion of the bone in front of the fissure of Glaser, and then remov- ing with bone forceps the anterior wall of the meatus, excepting the portion which supports the membrana tympani.

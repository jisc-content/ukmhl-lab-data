MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 774 Vessels and Nerves—Tlie arteries of thepenis are derivedfrom the uiterixal jiudic ; tliey are—tlie arteries of tlie bulb, arteries of tlie cor- ^ ]His cavernosum, and Its m?is are superficial and deep. The deep veins run by the side of the deep arteries, and tei-minate in the internal pudic veins. The superficial veins escape in considerable numl)er fi'oni the base- of the glans, and con- verge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which re- ceives otlier A'eins from the corpus caA-ernosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the liga- mentum suspensorium, and tlirougli the tri- angular ligament be- neath the arch of the pubes, to terminate in the prostatic plexus. The Ijrmphatics ter- minate in the upper grou]3 of inguinal glands, while some of the dee2)er lymphatics lake the course of the urethra and end in the pelvic glands. The nerves are derived from the pudic nerve, sacral j)lexus, and hypogastric plexus. Fig. 476.—Structure of the peripheral portion of the corpus cavernosum penis, i, a, a. Superficial net- work, h.

The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus uriuarius. It is curved in its course, and composed of three layers, a mucous coat, submucous coat, and muscular coat. The mucous coat is thin and smootli ; it is con- tinuous internally with the mucous membrane of the bladder ; externally, with the investing membrane of the glans; and at certain points of its extent, with the lining uieuibrane of the numerous ducts which open into the urethra, namely, those of

VILLI AND GLANDS. 731 part of the ileum they become narrower and more scanty, and are finally lost altogether at about the middle of the latter. Each fold or valve extends for about one-half or three-fourths around the cylinder of the intestine ; and as they spring from all sides of its circumference, they have the appearance of circular septa. The jejunum owes its considerable thickness to these valves ; and as they are small in the upper half of the ileum and wanting in its lower half, the thinness of the latter is due to their absence. The valvnlES conniventes differ from the rugee described as present in the stomach, in that they are not obliterated when the wall of the canal is put on the stretch. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is lined on its inner surface by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells ; on its deep aspect it is bounded by a layer of unstrij)ed muscular fibre forming the muscularis mucosce. Villi and Glands.—Besides the larger folds on the mucous membrane, there are certain more minute structures, which can Fio. 441.—Mucous membrane of the small intestine, showing villi.

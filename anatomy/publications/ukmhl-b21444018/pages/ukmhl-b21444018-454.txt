382 COMMON CAROTID AH'J'ERY. clavicular articulation, the, left from the arcli of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that the right carotid is shorter than the left; it is also more anterior ; and, in consequence of proceeding from a branch instead of from the main trunk, is larger than its fellow. The right common carotid artery (Fig. 250, 11) ascends the ' neck perpendicularly by the side of the trachea and larynx, from behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the' ex- ternal carotid and internal carotid. The left common carotid (Fig. 250, 16) passes somewhat oli- liquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the side of the neck, and thence upwards by the side of the trachea and ccsophagus to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides like the right common carotid into the external carotid and internal < carotid. Relations.â€”The common carotid artery, in the neck, is enclosed in a fibrous sheath, which also contains the internal jugular vein, lying to the outer side of the artery, and the vagus nerve, whicli lies between and behind both. The sheath rests on the vertebral column, having interposed the sympathetic nerve and anterioi' muscles of the vertebral column, and being crossed behind by the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve.

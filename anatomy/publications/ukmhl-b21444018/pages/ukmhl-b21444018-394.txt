TRIANGULAR AND QUADRANGULAR SPACES. 322 Relations.—By its posterior surface witli the ]ati«siiiiU8 doi'.-si, scapular head of the triceps, and integument. By its anterior surface with tlie subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, coraco-bracliialis, short head ot tlie biceps, axillary vessels, and nerves of the brachial plexus. By Its up23er Ijorder it is in relation with the teres minor, from which It IS sejjarated by the scapular head of the triceps ; and, by the lower, forms, with the latissimus dorsi, the lower and posterior border of the axilla. Nerve-supply.—Middle and long sul)scapular Tranches derived from the posterior cord of the l)rachial plexus. Triangular and Quadrangular Spaces.—A large triangulai' space exists between tlie two teres muscles, which is divided into two minor spaces by the long head of the triceps. The smaller of the two spaces is placed posteriorly ; it is ti'iangular in form, being bounded above by the teres minor, below by the teres major, and Fin. 223.—Scapular muscles, vessels, and nerves, i. Supra-scapular nerve. 2. Cir- cumflex nerve. 3. Snpra-spiuatus. 4. Posterior circumflex artery. 5. Infra- spinatus. 6. Delcoid (reflected). 7. Teres major and latissimus. 8. Brachial artery, g. Teres minor. 10. Muscular spiral nerve. 11. Dorsalis scapulw artery. 12. Triceps (outer head). 13. Triceps (long head). in front by the long head of the tricej^s. It gives passage to the dorsalis scapulae vessels. The anterior space is quadi-angular, and is bounded above by the teres minor, below by the teres major, in front by the humerus, and behind by the long head of the tricej)S ; it transmits the posterior circumflex vessels and circumflex nerve. Actions.—The supra-spinatus raises the arm from the side ; but feebly, from the disadvantageous direction of its force. The infra-

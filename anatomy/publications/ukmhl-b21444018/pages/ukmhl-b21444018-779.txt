STKUCTUEE OF THE BRONCHIAL TUBES. 691 The air-cells are polygonal in form, and vary in diameter from .15 mm. to .35 mm.; they are smallest in the centre of the lung, and largest along the thin edges. Near the apex of the lobule the cells open singly into the alveolar jDassage, but at the base they are clustered, and several cells com- municate with each other before opening into the infundibulum. The wall of the air-cells is com- posed of the stromal tissue of the lung, formed in large part of yellow elastic tissue, with are- olar tissue and a few muscular fibres mixed. The white fibres are distinguished by numeroiis corj)uscles scattered throughout them. The air-cells are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, most of which are large flat cell- FiG. 404.—Two primary lobuli or infundi- bula. a, a. Exterior of lobules, b, b.

The capillaries of the lungs form plexuses which occupy the walls and septa of the air-cells and the walls of the alveolar passages, but are not continued into the bronchial tubes. The capillary plexus in the wall of each air cell consists of a single layer of vessels, which is so disposed that it is ex- posed to the air con- tained in two contiguous air-cells. The air-cells of the central part of tlie lung are most vas- ciUar, and at the same time smallest, whilst those of the jieriphery are less vascular and lavrrnT- 40.S-—Arrangement of the capillaries of the . human lung.

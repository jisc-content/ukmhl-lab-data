The FLEXOR ACCESSORIUS arises by two slips, the inner of which is fleshy and the outer tendinous ; tlie former is attached to the inner surface of the os calcis, and the latter to the under sui'face of the same bone a little in front of tlie outer tuberosity, and to the long plantar ligament. It is inserted into the outer border, and upper and lower surfaces of the long flexoi' tendon. Relations. — By its superficial sur- face with the three muscles of the superficial layer, from which it is separated by their fascial sheaths, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the under part of the OS calcis and long plantar ligament. Nerve - supply. —External plantar nerve. The LUMBRI - CALES (lumbricus, an earth - worm) are four little miiscles arising from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum at their ]3oint of bifurca- tion, each, vdili the excej)tion of the most internal, being attached to two tendons ; they are inserted into the expansion of the extensor tendons, and the base of the first phalanx of tlie four lesser toes on their inner side. They pass between the digital slips of the plantar fascia to their insertion. Nerve-supply.—The two inner by digital branches of the internal plantar nerve, the two outer by the deep branch of the external plantar. Fig. 248. — Deep muscles of the sole of the foot. I.

HEART. 664 walls of the ventricle and serve as muscles to the valves. A num- ber of these tendinous cords converge to a single muscular attach- ment. Of the three segments of which the valve is composed one is placed anteriorly, and is connected with the anterior wall, a second is placed against the posterior wall, while the third lies between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of the pulmo- nary artery ; the first of , these (anterior) is attached by means of chordae tendinese to a papillary muscle springing from the anterioi' free wall of the cavity, the second (left or infundibular) is attached in like manner to a papillary muscle on the posterior Avail, while the third is connected directly by its chordae to the ventricular septum {posterior or septal). Between the bases of these three flaps small intermediate folds are usually found. The chordae tendineae are at- tached not only to the margins of the valve segments, but also to the base and outer or ventricular surface ; there are none, however, at- tached to the inner surface, over which the blood passes in its course from the auricle to the ven- tricle, so that this surface is smooth throughout, and fric- tion is thus lessened. The tricuspid valves prevent the regurgi- tation of blood into the auricle during the contraction of the ventricle, and they are prevented from being them- selves driven back by the chordae ten- dineae and their mus- cular attachments. The columnae car- neae (fleshy columns) is a name exi:)ressive of the appearance of the internal walls of the ventricles, which, with the exception of the infundibulum, seem formed of muscula Fio. 386.—Portion of the wall of the ventricle d, d', :md aoita, «,6.c, showing attachments of one flap of the mitral and the aortic valves, /tandg-.

PELVIC FASCIA. 3" PELVIC FASCIA. Dissection.—The pelvic fascia may he dissected in three different ways, and viewed from three diifereiit aspects ; thus, (i) it may be seen from above, by stripping the peritoneum from the wall of the pelvis and the surface of the bladder, and carefully removing the extra-peritoneal fat. Again, (2) it may be seen from below, by removing the fat and the hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves from the ischio-rectal fossa. After tlie layer covering the levator ani Fig. 218.—Side view of pelvis, showing the line of section tlirough the bone to display the pel- vic fascia, i. Ex- ternal cutaneous nerve. 2.

(3) To obtain a lateral view of the pelvic fascia a more elaborate dissection is required. The muscles attached to one side of the pubic arch and margin of the obturator foi'ainen are to be completely removed, and also the obturator membrane. The spine

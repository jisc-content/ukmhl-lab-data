The left, two inches in length, and smaller than the right, passes obliquely beneath the arch of the aorta, and divides into two branches, both of which are placed below the ])nlmonary artery (hyparterial branches), and pass to the two lobes of the left lung. From this arrangement of the bronchi it seems probable that the two lower lobes of the right lung corre- spond to the -^diole of the left, and that the upper lobe of the right is entirely additional. Upon entering the lungs the bronchi divide into branches, and each of these divides and subdivides dicho- FiG. 401.â€”Heart and lungs. I.

The bronchial tubes or bronchioles are cylindrical tubes which differ from tlie bronchi in not being flattened posteriorly, and in liaving the cartilaginous and muscular layers distributed throughout theii' entire calibre. The cartilages cease to be regular rings and become irregulai- plates, which are most developed at tlie points of division of the bronchioles, where they form a concave ridge pro- jecting into the tube ; they disappear altogether when the tube is reduced to one millimetre in diameter. Connecting tlie cartilages and arranged outside them is a layer of fibrous tissue forming the fihrons coat; in the smallest tubes it is found devoid of cartilage, and becoming thinner is at length continued into the areolar stroma 2 X

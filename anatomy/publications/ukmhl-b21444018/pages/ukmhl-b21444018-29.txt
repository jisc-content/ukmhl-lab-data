THE ANATOMIST'S VADE MECUM. PART I. HISTOLOGY. The human hocly, complicated tliougli it bo, is made up of a small munber of elementary tissues ; these by their different combina- tions form the several organs, and a knowledge of them is there- fore essential to the proper understanding of those organs and their uses. The textures of the body which will be described in this section of the work are as follows :—Cells, l)lood and lymph corpuscles, epithelium,,areolar tissue, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, pigment, cartilage, boiie, muscle, nerve, blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and glands, seroTis and synovial membranes, mucous membrane, and secreting glands. Some of these are simple in their constitution, and l)y their combination form the more complex,—such are the cells and til)rous tissues ; others are composed of many different con- stituents, arranged often in a very complex manner, and among these are included the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and secreting glands. The latter are here described because it is necessary to consider them apart from the several organs in which they are found, and because it is convenient to speak of them in connection willi the more elementary tissues of which they are constructed. CELLS AND PROTOPLASM. Every tissue in the body in its earliest condition consists of an aggregation of minute solid particles which have received the name of cells. Some of the tissues retain throughout life the cellular character, but these are few in number, the majority oidy having their origin from cells indicated by the presence of minute remains A

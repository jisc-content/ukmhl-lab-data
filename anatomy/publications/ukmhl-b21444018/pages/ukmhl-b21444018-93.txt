By drawing nourishment from the corium they increase rapidly in size, more especially in length ; the upper part then becomes separated from the rest to form a new cell, while the lower part, remaining still attached to the 1)asement membrane, again elongates by the imbition of new material; again it divides, and so ad ivfinitum.

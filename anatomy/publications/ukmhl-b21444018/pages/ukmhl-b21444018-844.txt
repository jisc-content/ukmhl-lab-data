The nerves form tlie splenic plexus and are derived from the solar plexus. THE SUPRA RENAL BODIES. The supra-renal bodies or mpra-renal capsules are two small yellowish and flattened bodies surmounting the kidneys, and inclin- ing inwards towards the vertebral column. The riglit is somewhat three-cornered in shape, the left semilunar ; they are connected to the kidneys by the common investing areolar tissue, and each capsule is marked on its anterior surface by a fissure or hilum which appears to divide it into two lobes. The right supra-renal body is closely adherent to the posterior and Fig. 463.—Section of ^p, under surface of the liver, the left bodyTa'ftetus! 1^ lies in contact with the pancreas shovviuK the lower '^^^^ spleen.

Each body is about one and three-quarter inches in height, an inch and a quarter in width, and from two to three lines in thickness ; they weigh from one to two drachms. Structure.— A section of a supra-renal body shows that it has externally a fibrous investment or capsule, and internally is divisible into two portions, that nearest the surface and forming the great bulk of the organ being firm, striated, and of a brownish-yellow colour ; this is the cortical portion. The central or medullary portion is of a brownisli-black colour, and so soft that many anatomists have erroneously supposed a cavity to exist in it. The cortical portion consists of a stroma supporting cells, the cells being arranged in groups, the largest and most imj^ortant of Avhicli assume the ajjpear- ance of columns. Arnold has divided the cortical jjortion into three layers. The outer he calls the zona glovierulosa; in it the cell groups are round or oval in shape. The next layer he names the zonco fasciculata; it is much the thickest of the three layers, and forms the bulk of the organ ; in it the cells are arranged in columns placed at right angles to the surface of the organ. Tlie thii-d layer of the cortex is a very narrow one called zona reticularis; here the stroma is equally distributed, and the cells are consequently not arranged in groups. The cells of the cortex are polyhedral in shape, and consist of granular protoplasm containing oil globules; each

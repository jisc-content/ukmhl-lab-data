RELATIONS OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 437 upper part with the femoral xein, and lower down with the ad- ductor longus and sartorius. The immediate relations of the artery are the femoral vein, long saphenous nerve, and muscular nerve to the vastus internus. The \-ein at Poupart's ligament lies to the inner side of the artery ; hut lower down gets behind it, and inclines to its outer side. The muscular nerve lies to the outer side, and somewhat upon the sheath for the lower two-thirds of its extent; and the long saphenous nerve is situated within the sheath, and in front of the artery for the same extent.

Deep external jnidic, Muscular, Anastomotica magna. , The superficial circumflex iliac artery arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, and passes obliquely outwards towards the crest of the ilium, where it pierces the fascia lata. It supplies the integument of the groin, superficial fascia, and inguinal glands, and anastomoses with the deep circumflex iliac, gluteal and external circumflex arteries. The superficial epigastric arises from the femoral immediateh- be ow Pouparts ligament, pierces the fascia lata, and ascends obliquely towards the umbilicus between the two layers of the superficial fascia. It distrilnites branches to the inguinal glands

45° VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The veins of the head and neck may be arranged into three groups, namely, veins of the exterior of the head, veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium, veins of the neck. The veins of the exterior of the head are the— Facial, Internal maxillary. Temporal, Temporo-maxillary, Posterior auricular. Occipital. The facial vein commences on the anterior part of the head in a venous plexus, formed by the communications of the branches of the temjDoral, and descends along the middle line of the forehead, under the name of frontal vein, to the root of the nose, where it is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a communicating trunk, the nasal arch. There are usually two frontal veins, which communicate by a transverse inosculation ; but sometimes the vein is single and bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. From the nasal arch the frontal is con- tinued downwards by the side of the root of the nose, and near the angle of the eye, under the name of angular vein; it then passes beneath the zygomatic muscles, becomes the facial vein, and de- scends along the ante- rior border of the mas- seter muscle, crossing the body of the lower jaw by the side of the facial artery, to the submaxillary gland, and from thence to the internal jugular vein, in which it terminates.

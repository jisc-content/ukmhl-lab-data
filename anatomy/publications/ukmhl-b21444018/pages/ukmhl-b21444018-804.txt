The cells of the sur- face of the enlarge- ments are colum- nar, those of the interior are poly- gonal or stellate. By a more rapid downward growth at the sides than in the centre, these processes assume a cujDped or bell sha] le Avith the concavitx directed down- wards, and inti) this concavity tlie dentinal papilla i- i-eceived. The e.\- jiansions have long received the name of enamel germs, ur enamel organs, al- though much dif- ference of oijiniou exists as to the part ])layed l)y them in the jjrociuction of enamel. The outer cells of the enamel organ either remain unchanged or be- slightly atro- tliose which come phied lie on its cupped or concave siirface become greatly enlongated, and their nuclei recede to their bases : the central cells become chiefly converted into a stellate reticulum, tlie processes of the cells comimuii- cating freely with each other, but those whicli lie in contact with the columnar cells next the dental papilla remain unchanged and form a

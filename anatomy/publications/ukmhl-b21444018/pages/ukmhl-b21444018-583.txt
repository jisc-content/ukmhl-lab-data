495 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Behind the lateral nucleus is the greij tubercle of Rolando (g.), the upper expansion of the caput cornu posterioris, and on the sur- face of this a Avhite concave band, the ascending sensory root of the fifth ne)-ve (a.v.). In front of the latter a few fibres derived from the formatio reticularis wall be noticed {f.aP) ; they join the arciform fibres at the lower margin of the olive. If we now examine a section through the middle of the olivary body we shall find that important changes have taken place in the arrangement of j)arts. The central canal has disaj^peared, and the centre of the medulla is occupied by a raphe', composed of non- medullated fibres and multipolar cells ; it extends from the anterior median fissure to beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle.

These enclosed a wedge-shaped area which IS occupied by large and irregular grey nucleus, the corpus dentatum of the olive (0.), and, behind this, a snialler deposit of grey matter, the external accessor}/ olivary nucleus {0"). The nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus have been pushed outwards by the opening up of the medulla posteriorly to form the fourth ventricle, anS between them and the posterior median fissure a collection of grey matter has been interposed, which lies beneath the floor of the ZT , ^^ ^^"'.f"^f^^' ^^^fi^^te nuclei can be made out ST'k^'^ ^\ "^^^^^ !"^^ ^'^^ the fasciculus Ures {n.t\ (2) beneath and external to this, the nucleus of the hypoglossal

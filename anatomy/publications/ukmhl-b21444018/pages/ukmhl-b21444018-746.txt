PERICARDIUM. The central organ of circulation, the heart, i.s situated between the two layers of pleura which constitute the mediastinum, and is enclosed in a proper membrane, the pericardium. The pericardium is a tibro-serous membrane, its serous layer being reflected from the serous membrane of the viscus Avhicli it encloses. In shape it is like a truncated cone, the base being down- ward, the truncated apex upward, surrounding the aorta. It con- sists of two layers, external, fibrous; and internal, serons. The fibrous layer is attached above to the great vessels proceeding from the heart^ on which it is continuous with the deep cervical fascia ; and below, to the tendinous ]3ortion of the diaphragm. Where it encloses the great vessels it is jji-olonged on them for some distance

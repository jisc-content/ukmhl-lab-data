Upon cross section the dentinal tubules appear each to be surrounded by an annulus of consider- able thickness (Fig. 424) ; but it is probable that this appearance results from the obliquity of the sec- tion, by which a certain length of the tubes is seen as well as their extremities. The true wall of the canal can only be seen as a faint yellow ring {dentinal Fig- 424-—Transverse section of dtutiue, showing sheath of Neumann), and the tubules cut across, a, in the crown; B, in even this is not always inanifest. In the recent state the tubiiles are occupied by a proto- plasmic substance {dentinal fibre of Tomes), which is continuous with the nucleated cells of the dental pulp, and serves to con- vey nutritive material to the dentine ; it appears also to confer on the latter a certain amount of sensibility. The tubules are most numerous in the crown (Fig. 424, a), where they are closely crowded together, while in the fang they are much more scattered, so that here the matrix forms the largest element (Fig. 424, b). The matrix of the dentine appears to be i)erfectly homogeneous, witliotit trace of fibres or granules ; wben softened by reagents it has a tend- ency to split up into laminte, but no such lamination is observable in hard sections. The surface of tlie dentine which is in contact with the enamel is marked by hexagonal depressions, corresponding

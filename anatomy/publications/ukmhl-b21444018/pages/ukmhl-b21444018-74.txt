STRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. 46 inuRcular fibres ; in the lai-gest artei'ies of this class it is ininglcil with areolai' tissue, and exliibits a tendency to become laminated, the lamina) alternating with siuiilai' layers of areolar tissue. In the large arteries this is the common chixracter of the middle coat : the elastic tissue is laminated, and between the laminae are strata of areolai- and muscular tissue. The presence of elastic tissue as a chief constituent of the middle coat of large arteries gives them Fio. 60.—Transverse section of wall of posterior tibial artery, a.

The internal coat (tunca intima) is the thinnest of the tln-ee, and easily broken in the transverse direction ; it is composed of three layers, an internal layer or endothelium, a subendothelial layer, and an external elastic membrane, which is either homogeneous or made up of elastic elements, disposed in a longitudinal direction. The in- ternal endothelial layer is formed by a single layer of flattened cells, very thin, polygonal oi' elliptical in shape, and having transparent oval nuclei; their outlines can ])e made evident hy pencilling the inner surface of the artery Antli a solution of nitrate of silver. The subendothelial layer is absent from the smallest artei'ies, l)ut is distinguishable in all those of medium and large size in the form of longitudinal Inindles of fibrous connective tissue, between Avhich are Fio. 61.—Endothelium numerous anastomosing branched connective- lining an artery, ^.^^^^g ^j^g ^^^^^^^.^ ^^y^^ ^jj.^^^ o-eneous membrane of the fenestrated kind, perforated with minute oblong openings having a direction parallel with the axis of the vessel. It is thrown into longitudinal fold.s when the vessel is empty, and becomes extremely delicate, and is finally lost in the minute vessels. Exteriorly this layer assumes a reticulated char- acter, and is made up of a longitudinal netwoi-k of elastic fibres.

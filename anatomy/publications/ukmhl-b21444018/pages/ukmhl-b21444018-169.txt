NASAL FOSS^. 129 of the great wing of the sphenoid, internally hj the vertical plate of the palate ; it is wide above, near the base of the skull, but narrow below, where it is continued into the upper part of the descending palatine canal. The fossa has opening into it three fissures and five foramina : the former are the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary, and pterygo-maxillary; the latter are the foramen rotunduni. Vidian, descending palatine, pterygo-palatine, and spheno-palatine. The foramen rotundum, Vidian, and pterygo-palatine foramina are on the posterior wall, being placed in the order of their enumeration from above downwards ; the spheno-palatine is on the inner wall, and the descending palatine below. The fossa lodges Meckel's ganglion, the superior maxillary nerve, and the third part of the internal maxillary artery ; and the foramina which open into it (with the excejjtion of the foramen rotundum) give passage to nerve- twigs derived from the ganglion and small branches of the artery. The nasal fossae are two irregular cavities, situated in the middle of the face, and extending from before back-wards. They are bounded above by the nasal spine of the frontal, nasal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and sphenoidal turbinated bones; beloiv by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones ; externally by the superior maxillary, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, superior and middle tur- binated bones of the ethmoid, palate, and internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid ; and the two fossae are separated by the vomer and perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid. The inner wall presents a large triangular notch anteriorly, which in the recent state is filled in by the cartilage of the septum. These may be more clearly ex- pressed in a tabular form :â€” NASAL FOSS^. Frontal (nasal spine). Nasal bones.5 Ethmoid. Sphenoid. Sphenoidal turbinated bones. C3 Nasal fossa.

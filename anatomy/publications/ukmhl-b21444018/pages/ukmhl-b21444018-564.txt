Glands.—Tlie superficial more tlian four or five in iiu Fig. 286. — Superficial lymphntic vessels and glands of the arm and axilla. direction of the median vein. lymphatic glands of the arm are not ml)er, and of very small size. One or tw(j arc .situated near tlie median l)asilic and median cejihalic vein, at the l)end of the elhow ; and one ov two near the basilic vein, on the inner side of the upper arm, imme- diately above the ell)ow. The deep glands in the forearm are excessively small and infrequent; two or three may he found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels. In the uj)per arm there is a chain of small glands, accompanying the brachial artery. The axillary glands are nume- rous and of large size. Some are closely adherent to the vessels, others are dispersed in the loose areolar tissue of the axilla, and a small chain may be observed extending along the lower border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland, recei^dng the lymphatics of that organ and of the front of theche&twall{pectoralglands). A similar chain is found along the subscapular vessels at the back of the axilla ; it receives the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the l)ack (subscapular glands). Two or three subclavian glands are situated beneath the clavicle, and ser\"e as the niedium of communication between the axillary and deep cervical lym- lihatic glands(i7ifra-claviculargla7ids). Vesskls.—The superficial lym- phatic vessels of the upper extre- mity commence on the fingers and take their course along the forearm to the bend of the elbow. The greater part reach their destination bypassing along the dorsal surface of the fingers, wrist, and forearm, and then curving around the borders of the latter ; but some few are met with in the palm of the hand, which take the At the bend of the elbow the lym-

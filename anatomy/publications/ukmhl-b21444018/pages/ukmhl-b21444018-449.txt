377 PART V. ANGIOLOGY. In the section on Histology two sets of vessels have been described, namely, those carrying blood and those carrying lymph, and the former have further been divided into arteries, veins, and capillaries. The description of the capillaries can, however, only be satisfactorily given in connection with the organs of which they form a part, so that their arrangement and distribution will not now occupy our attention. The present section will therefore be devoted to the description of the arteries, veins, and lymphatics. ARTERIES. In the consideration of the arteries, the aorta will be first de- scribed, with the branches of that trunk and their subdivisions, which together constitute the efferent portion of the systemic circula- tion ; and then the pidmonary artery as the efferent trunk of the pulmonary circulation. AORTA. The aorta arises from the base of the left ventricle, at the middle of the root of the heart on a level with the body of the sixth dorsal vertebra, and presents at its commencement an enlargement caused by three dilatations of the walls of the vessel, the sinuses of Val- salva, and corresponding with the three semilunar valves. It ascends at first forwards and to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into the arch, descending or thoracic, and abdominal aorta. The ARCH OF THE AORTA, commencing at a point corresponding with the articulation of the cartilage of the third rib with the sternum on the left side, crosses behind and near the sternum to a point corresponding with the upper boi'der of the articulation of the second rib witli the sternum on the right side. It then curves backwards and to the left, and descends to the left side of the body

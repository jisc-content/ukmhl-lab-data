The celL- lie in a gelatinou.- semifluid substance (called the ground, substance), whicli joins the fibres of the tissue togethei-, making them into bundles, occupying in it cavities (called " cell spaces ") which coii'espond accurate! y to the shape and size of each cell. Be- sides the branched cells, there are also migratory or Avaiider cells, like found in areolar tissue a uuiiil)er of the white corpuscles of the blood, composed of protoplasm, and con taining one or more nuclei. These cells lia-\'e the power of moving from plaice to place, and they l)ecome especially numerous when the tissue undergoes intlammatiou. The fibres are very tine, measuring from Kal 5 0T)F5 to of an inch, and are apparently structureless By means of the ground suljstance they are united into bundles, which have a wavy course, and, when viewed by reflected light, ha\'e a white and shining appearance. Mixed with these we commonly find a number of coarser fibres, having a tendency to curl at their ends, and not gathered into Inindles ; acetic acid, which causes the bundles of hl)i'es to swell U]i and l)ecome indistinct, has no effect on these single fibres ; they will l)e more fully described in a later ]iagi' as yellow tissue, it constituting anasarca. Areolar tissue is found beneath the skin, forming a continuous layer all over the body ; beneath .serous and mucous meml)ranes ; around muscles, vessels, and nerves, form- ing sheaths for them, and connecting them with neighliouring or elastic fibres. From the loose arrangement of areolar is often sul)jecte(l during life to infiltration of fluid, this ])arts. It is also found connecting and supporting the lobules

PELVIC FASCIA. 314 terior true ligament of the bladder, or pubo-prostatic ligament, and a.s there is a puucli-like depression in tlie centre, dividing the tascia of one side tVoni that on the other, each side rises up in a little curved ridge, so that there are two anterior ligaments. The space between the two contains, external to the fascia, the dors;d vein of the penis before it enters tlie prostatic plexus. At the side.- of the pelvis the anterior ligaments aic continued back into another ]m-t of the pelvic fascia, wliich is reflected inwards towards the bladder from tlu- line of origin of the visceral layer. This begins as a strong wliite Ijand, and is called the lateral ligament of the bladder; it not only reaches tlit side of the bladder, but is continued over it, although it becomes very thin and is almost lost in the areolar tissm- over the ajDex. If the lateral ligament be divided near its attachment to the liladder, there will be found beneath it another layer of fascia passing across the pelvis lietvA'een bladder and rectum ; this is the recto- vesical fascia. As it crosses the pelvis it gives capsules to tlu- l)rostate gland and vesiculte seminales, and forms a sheath which encloses the lower three inches of the rectum ; posteriorly, it onl}' extends back as far as the posterior limit of the trigone of the Via. 221.—Dia- gram of the layers of pel- vic fascia, i.

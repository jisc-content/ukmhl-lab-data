WILSON'S ANATOMIST'S VADE MECUMWILSON'S ANATOMIST'S VADE MECUM A SYSTEM . OF HUMAN ANATOMY. ELEVENTH EDITION EDITED BY HENRY EDWARD CLARK FELLOW OP THE FACULTY OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OP GLASGOW JIEMBEK OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OP SURGEONS OP ENGLAND PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN ST. MUNGO'S COLLEGE, GLASGOW LONDON J. & A. CHURCHILL 11, NEW BURLINGTON STREET 1892PREFACE TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION. The title of Vade Mecum, given to this work by the author, Sir Erasmus Wilson, indicated an intention that it should be a portable manual, containing all that an ordinary student required to know of human anatomy, but not discussing disputed points, or attempting to give everything that could be said on each anatomical detail. The editor of the present edition has endeavoured to act up to this intention, and consequently has neither increased the size of the pages, nor added materially to their number. He cannot claim for this edition that it contains any novel features, or is distinguished from its predecessors by startling changes; but he has left no part untouched by revision, and has endeavoured to make the work fairly represent the present state of anatomical knowledge. The description of the central nervous system has under- gone more change than any other part of the book ; but, while giving the results of the latest investigations, no change has been made for the mere sake of change, and the rage for new names, which seems at present to afflict anatomists, has been kept (it is hoped), withm reasonable limits. Finding it impossible in the space at his disposal to give a complete description of the development of the embryo, the editor has thought it best to omit altogether the paragraphsvi PREFACE. which in the last edition gave some particulars of the develop- ment of certain organs, as these presupposed a knowledge of the earlier stages of embryonic evolution. The Vade Mecum in its earliest editions was distinguished by the number and excellence of its illustrations, and was, indeed, a pioneer work in this respect. Now, when wood- cuts are so numerous in anatomical works that they not tin- frequently outnumber the pages, such a reputation is not easy to maintain. Very numerous additions have, however, been made in this department; they have been drawn from various British and foreign sources, and their origin is in every instance acknowledged in the List of Illustrations at the beginning of the work. It is interesting to notice that, Avhile the woodcuts in the first edition (1840) numbered 150, they have now reached a total of nearly 500. 24 India Street, Glasgow, August 1892.CONTENTS. PART I.

The human hocly, complicated tliougli it bo, is made up of a small munber of elementary tissues ; these by their different combina- tions form the several organs, and a knowledge of them is there- fore essential to the proper understanding of those organs and their uses. The textures of the body which will be described in this section of the work are as follows :â€”Cells, l)lood and lymph corpuscles, epithelium,,areolar tissue, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, pigment, cartilage, boiie, muscle, nerve, blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and glands, seroTis and synovial membranes, mucous membrane, and secreting glands. Some of these are simple in their constitution, and l)y their combination form the more complex,â€”such are the cells and til)rous tissues ; others are composed of many different con- stituents, arranged often in a very complex manner, and among these are included the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and secreting glands. The latter are here described because it is necessary to consider them apart from the several organs in which they are found, and because it is convenient to speak of them in connection willi the more elementary tissues of which they are constructed. CELLS AND PROTOPLASM. Every tissue in the body in its earliest condition consists of an aggregation of minute solid particles which have received the name of cells. Some of the tissues retain throughout life the cellular character, but these are few in number, the majority oidy having their origin from cells indicated by the presence of minute remains A2 CELLS AND PROTOPLASM. Fia. 1. â€” Different kinds of cells with nuclei and proto- Ijlasm. called nuclei. Cells are for the most part splu'roidal in shaj>e, unless modified by pressure or other causes, when tliej' may be- come oval, fusiform, scaly, or liexagoual ; in jjig- ment, connective tissue, and tlie nervous centr(-s they are stelhite, having ramifying processes wliich communicate with cacli other so as to form a net- work. Besides tliose contained in the tissues there are also free cells floating in the fluid of blood, lymph, and chyle, and one form of them has the l)ower of leaving these fluids and travelling through the tissues; these, the "white corpuscles'' of the blood, have hence been termed 'â– ^ivander cells." Each cell consists of an albuminoid material, transparent, colourless, and of a jelly-like consistence, called proto])lasm. The cell may have a distinct bound- ing memltrane or cell-^vaU, but this is not in- variably the case with tlie cells of animal tissues ; it has usually one or more central spots called nuclei, within which again are one or two smaller spots called nucleoli; but botli nucleus and nucle- olus may be absent without interfering with the vitality of the cell. Protoplasm has commonly agranular appearanct-. and this is generally due to the existence of a veiy tine network of fibrils with slight nodes at tlic points where they intersect (intercellular network). The network is known as the reticulum or spongio- plasm, while the substance occujiying its meshes is called the hyaloplasm. Protoplasm is a joroteid substance, similar to albumen; it has a strong affinity for staining fluids, especially for carmine and hoematoxylin, consist- very largely of water, but is not mis- cible witli that fluid, and is weakly alkaline or neutral in reaction. It possesses remarkable vital properties, the chief of wliich are, (a) its jiower of motion, (h) its active nutrition, and (c) the ijrocluction of similar masses of protoplasm by division. The power of motion of protoplasm is exhibited in three ways:â€”(i.) In changiug its shape and position, by putting out irregular processes (p.feudopo(Ha), and then drawing the general mass onwards to the position they occupy ; this is known as ama;b(iid motion, and by it the protoplasmic mass is able to travel from place to jjlace. (2.) The second form of uiotiou consists of streaming movements in the su])stance of the pi'otoplasm (whether it ])e statiouaiy or ex- hibit amaiboid movements), and in the pseudopodial processes of Fio. 2.â€”Diagramof acellwith two nuclei, showing intercellular I and Internuclear network.3 KARYOKINESIS. amajboid protoplasm. (3.) Tlie protoplasm is able to wrap itself around a foreign particle of matter with which it is brought in con- tact, and again to withdraw from it: this is called a movement of in- tussusception. The nutrition of protoplasm consists in its taking up material from without and converting it into substance like itself ; upon this selective and constructive j)ower depends the development and growth of all organised bodies, whether animal or vegetable. Tlie nihdeus consists of a small spherical or oval body embedded in the protoplasm, and generally surrounded by a definite mem- brane. The nuclear substance is divisible into a nuclear fluid and a nucleoylasm or miclear network. The fluid does not take on stain readily, and hence has been named achromatin, while the network, from its affinity for the stain, has been called chromatin or chromo- ])lasm. The nuclear network sometimes contains one or more granules or globules, called nucleoli, situated at the intersections of the fibres. The multiplication of protoplasmic masses, or cell-multiplica- tion, takes -place by direct or indirect division. Direct Division, or Karyostenosis, consists in the division of the nucleus without any changes taking place in its structure, followed by the division of the protoplasm. This was formerly supposed to be the common mode of cell - division, but recent investigation shows that neither in animal nor vege- table cells is direct cell-division common. Indirect Division, wherein the division of the cell is preceded by a series of complex changes in the nuclear network. These, briefiy stated, are as fol- lows :â€” (i.) The nxicleus becomes enlarged, and the chromo- plasm, which in the rest- ing nucleus forms a net- iS IZZT f'T^t'^ t-Vicws of various stages of karyokinesi. mto a number of fine fila- a.

The achromatic spindle appears first at the end of the nnclens towards which the filaments of chromoplasm are directed (iMlar end), hut from thence it moves and takes up a position in the middle of the nuclens. (3.) The chromatic filaments become shorter and thicker, and are disposed in V-shaped loops radiating fi'om the centre of the achromatic spindle {aster stage, Fig. 4, e.f.) ; the filaments next split in their length into two very fine threads. (4.) The threads of the split chromosomes separate, and the two derived from each primary filament pass along the achromatic fibrils in opposite directions towards the poles of the spindle. As they approach the pole they have a radiate appearance (like a rosette) at each end of the nncleus, and this stage has hence been called the diaster stage (Fig. 4, h.). (5.) As soon as the chromosomes separate in this manner into two groups, one at each pole of the nucleus, the cell protoplasm commences to divide, and thus two cells are formed, which, however, remain for some time intimately connected. (6.) The chromatic filaments in the nucleus of each daughter-cell give off branches ; these become convoluted, and form by their inter-communications the intermiclear network of the resting nucleus. Protoplasm iindergoes a change at its surface, esjiecially in old cells, being converted into a harder layer constituting the cell-wall ; such cells lose their power of amseboid movement, and, uniting with other cells, form tissues. Cells are connected Avith each other either by means of their processes (as aljove mentioned), by direct union of their walls, or by an intercellular substance. BLOOD. Blood is a rather thick fluid, of a bright red or scarlet colour in the arteries, and of dark purjile tint in the veins. It has a salt taste, a slight alkaline reaction, a peculiar faint odour, and a sjiecific gravity of 1055. It consists of a colourless, transparent fluid, the liquor sanguinis, and of small solid particles, called corpuscles, floating in the fluid. When drawn from the body, it speedily solidifies or coagulates into a jelly-like substance, called a clot, which as it contracts squeezes out a small quantity of transparent, straw-coloured fluid knoAvn as serum. In the process of coagulation a substance called fibrin is formed, which entangles the corpuscles in its meshes, so that the clot is formed of fibrin and corpuscles, and is of red colour. The I'elation between the constituents of blood in the liquid and coagulated states is shown in the following scheme :â€” (Corpuscles ....") I J-Clot Liquid blood/ /'Fibrin j ' Liquor sanguinis/ V Serum . . Coagulated blood.BLOOD. 5 The blood corpuscles are of two kinds, red and white, the former greatly exceeding the latter in number. In healthy human blood the proportion of white to red corpuscles varies from i to looo to I to 250. According to Vierordt, a cubic millimeter of healthy human blood contains on an average 5,000,000 red corpuscles and 10,000 white ones. The Red Corpuscles are circular, l )iconcave discs, having a diameter of about yjo'oo of an inch, and a thickness of johoa of an inch ; they do not possess a nucleus. In diseased conditions, and occasionally in health, there are also found smaller red corpuscles, about one-third the size of the ordinary ones, and spheroidal in shape. The cor- puscles are elastic, and conse- quently change their shape when subject to compression. When the blood is drawn from the vessels, they tend to aggre- gate together and coliere by their broad surfaces, so as to fig form columns like piles (rou- leaux) of coins. Their shape also varies according to the specific gravity and cliemical composition of tlie fluid in which they are placed. The red corpuscles consist of a tough, elastic, transparent stroma, sup- porting a red crystallisable substance called hcemoglobin (C600H960N154 FeSjOijg), which has a strong affinity for oxygen, and can be separated from the corpuscles by certain simple processes in the form of rhombic crystals. The White Corpuscles are larger than tlie red ones, having a dia- meter of osVo "^^^ ^^"^^^^' when at rest, they are spherical and have a gi'anular apjjearance, but they have power of changing their shape, and putting out processes in the manner above de- â– =r-^V R scribed as amse- boid motion. They are trans- parent masses of ^^'<5- 6.â€”White corpuscles of the blood undergoing amaeboid protoi)lasm, and changes, po.ssess one or more nuclei, have no cell-wall, and frequently con- tain granules, oi' minute masses of red colouring matter.

The white corpuscles are l)y soiiie observers regarded as an early stage of the red corjniscles. In addition to the red and white corpuscles of the 1)lood, other solid particles have been described under the name of hmmatoblasts by Hayem, and of hlood-iolatelets by Bizzozero. They are found in the midst of the interlacing threads of fil)rin in clot, after washing awav the corpuscles, as minute, round, colourless, disc-like jmrticles, gene- rally aggregated into masses. They have also been observed in the living blood in the smaller vessels of the rat's mesentery; their exact nature is uncertain. The Liquor Sanguinis, or Plasma of the blood, is composed of serum, and of two fibrin-factors which unite when the Ijlood is drawn from the body to form fibrin, and thus determine the coagulation of the blood. Tlie serum is the liquor .sanguinis deprived of its fibrin ; it has a specific gravity of 1.027, alkaline in reaction, and contains albumen, salts, fatty matter, gases, and sugar. Fibrin is formed by the union of two fibrin-factors, called fibrino- plastin and fibrinogen. Fibrinoplastin, or paraglobulin, is in j)art contained in the white corpuscles, and in part held in solution in the liquor sanguinis ; it can be precipitated from the liquor san- guinis, in the form of a white powder, l)y diluting that fluid with ten times its bulk of ice-cold water, and then passing a stream of CO., through it. Fibrinogen is held in solution in the liquor san- guinis, and can be also thrown down as a white powder by a more copious dilution, and a more complete saturation with COo than is requisite to precipitate fibrinoplastin. The combination of these factors is brought about by means of a third substance called the fibrin-ferment. Fibrin can lie obtained from fresh blood by whipping it with twigs, as fine fibrils of a pale straw-colour, which are in- soluble in water, alcohol, or ether. Gases of the Blood.â€”The blood contains a very large volume of gases, jmrtly in combination, partly free. These are Carlwnic Acid, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. They differ in their proportion in arterial and venous blood, as shown in the following table :â€” Oxygen. Carbonic Acid. Nitrogen. Vols. Vols. Vols. Arterial blood . . 16 30 i to 2 Venous blood . . 6 to 10 35 i to 2 The oxygen is for the most part in loose combination \yith the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles ; the carbonic acid is in com- bination with the salts of the serum, especially with the salts of sodium ; the nitrogen is suspended in the liquor sanguinis. LYMPH AND CHYLE. Lymph is a nearly colourless, transparent fluid, contuined in a special system of vessels called lymphatics or absorbents. The lym- phatics of the small intestine carry, during digestion, a milky fluid7. JlPlTHELIUM. named chyle, wliicli consists of lymph mixed with the products of digestion ; hut diiring fasting, these vessels cany transparent lymph, the same as lymphatic vessels elsewhere. Lymph consists of a fluid portion, or lymph-plasma, and corpuscles, lymph corpuscles, floating in it. The plasma resembles liquor san- guinis, and contains about five per cent, of albumen and one per cent, of salts. The corpuscles are indistinguishable from the white corpuscles of the blood, being nucleated masses of protoplasm having the power of anipeboid movement; they are most numerous in the lymph after it has passed through the lymphatic glands. ' Chyle consists also of a fluid, containing corpuscles identical with those of lymph ; but it also has what is called a molecular basis, con- sisting of minute particles of fat Avith some oil vesicles ; it is this which gives the milky appearance^ Both lymph and chyle resemble blood in spontaneously coagulating when removed ivom the body, forming a thin pale clot, from which serum exudes. EPITHELIUM. The epithelial tissues are distinguished by their retaining the cellular character throughout tlie whole of life ; they are used chiefly for the purpose of protection, l)ut epithelial cells constitute also the secreting cells of mucous membrane and of glands. The superficifd part of the skin consists of many supei'imposed layers of eiiithelial cells, constituting the epidermis; those cells on the surface become flattened and dried, and are cast off as thin scales. Besides forming the epidermis, epithelial cells are found covering the surface of the mucous membranes of the alimentary canal, lachrymal, nasal, and respiratory passages, the urinary and genital canals, the ventricles of the brain, and central canal of the spinal cord, also, lining the glandular recesses and ducts of secreting glands. Modified epithelial cells form the terminal nervous ap- paratus of the organs of special sense, such as the eye, eai^, and nose. A ijinglc layer of flattened epithelial cells covers the surface of the serous membranes of the abdomen, thorax, and cerebro-spinal cavity, and the synovial membrane of joints ; it also lines the heart, l^lood-vessels, and lymphatics, and "the anterior chamber of the eye. In these situations the epithelial tissue is formed from the mesoblastic layer of the embryo, whereas the epithelium elsewhere is derived from the epiblast or hypoblast; for this reason it has been the custom of late years to make a separate class for such tissues, under the name of endothelium. True epithelial tissue consists of one or more layers of nucleated cells, united together by an intercellular cement substance, and resting on a basement membrane, and is divisible into simple non- slralijied and stratified epithelium. Its varieties are the follow- ingEPITHELIUM. 8 Fjg. 7.â€” Old epithelium cells from the mouth. 1. Squamous. 2. Columnar. 3. Glandular. 4. Transitional. 5. Ciliated. r. Squamous, Scaly, oi' Tesselated Epithelium is so called be- cause the cells appear as thin flattened scales ; they frecjuently have in their centre a small nucleus and nu- cleolus, which are of soft consistence ; the rest of the cell is more dense. In the surface cells of the epidei-mis the nu- cleus and nucleolus disappear, the cells being converted into thin plates of horny consistence. On the skin, the mucous membrane of the oral cavity, lower half of pharynx, ccsophagns, nasal duct, tympanic cavity, ^-agina, female ui-ethra, bladder, ureter, pelvis of the kidney, and on the conjunctiva of the eye they form the surface layer of a thick mass of cells, the deeper constituents of which are commonly sphei'oidal or fusiform in shape. The scales are somewhat larger in the mouth and fauces than elsewhere, and in longest diameter measure to of an inch ; in the vagina between ar^-n and ; and on the skin ^-Jq. The nucleus, which is round or oval in shape and flattened, measures in scales from the mouth 0^00 inch. In the deeji layers of a stratified epithelium, and especially in the rete mucosum of the skin, there are found numerous cells with fine fibres or spikes projecting from their edges ; they are called prickle-cells. The processes Y\G. 8.â€”Prickle of neighbouring cells are joined in such a manner as cells from reu to leave little canals or intercellular channels between viucomm. ^^^^^^^^ 2. Columnar or Cylinder Epithelium consists of cells which have an elongated or pyriform shape, their bases being directed to the free surface, and their Fio. g.â€”Portion of col- umnar epithelium from one of the villi of the small intestines. 1.

They are ranged side by side like columns, and are con- nected together 1)y a small amount of iiilercelbdar or cement si(b- stance. Each column contains near its middle a nucleus, which gives it a swollen appearance, and the nucleus possesses one or more nucleoli ; from the traiis]iarehcy of the column the nucleus may be seen through its base. This form of epithelium is found in the alimentary canal from the cardiac end of the stomach to the anus, in the intestinal glands, in the manimarv and lachrymal glands, in 8 0 09 EPITHELIUM.

II.â€”Appearance of the surface formed by the apposition of the bases of several cells. the male urethra, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, Cowper's glands, glands of Bartholine, and uterine glands. Many of the cells have projecting processes on their edges, hj which they arc connected with similar pro- cesses in neighho;uing cells, the in- terstices left between the processes being filled in by lymphoid or other small cells. Tlie protoplasm both of the cell and nucleus appears gi-anular, this appearance being due to the presence of an intercellular and internucleai' network. Such cells often haA^e vacuoles in theii' substance ; others contain fatty globules or mucin. The mucin frequently distends the cell so much as to push the nucleus towards the attached end of the cell, and by still further distention bursts the cell, leaving a hollow cavity at the free extremity ; such cells are then called goblet or chalice cells. Columnar cells, especially those in the mucous membrane of the intes- tine, have an appearance of fine vertical striation at the free edge ; these stria) are probably minute rods or columns, and the part of the cell containing them is sometimes sepai'ated off from tlie I'est of the protoplasm liy a transverse line or plate. In the cells of the smaller salivary ducts, and in some of those lining the uriniferous tulles of the kidney, it is the attached border, and not the free one, which is striated. 3. Spheroidal or Glandular Epithelium is composed of cells which are spheroidal in shape, but often become more or less polyhedral from compression. This form of epithelium occurs in secreting glands such as the liver and pancreas, the salivary, gastric, and intestinal glands, and the glands of the skin. They appear granular owing to the presence of a fine reticulum in the cell and nucleus, and generally contain the materials which the gland secretes. 4- Transitional Epithelium is the early form of all the varieties Fig. 12.â€”Goblet-cells from the epi- thelium of an intestinal villus from the human subject, treated with Midler's fluid {Schulze). a.

In the pelvis of the kidney, nreter, urinary hladder, and urethra, however, the transitional e))itheliuni is ])eculiar, con- sisting of three or four layers of cells. The su]-face cells are smooth on their upper surface, but hollowed underneath into i)its which receive the rounded ends of pear-slia])ed cells situated beneath them ; between the narrow necks of the pear-shaped cells there arc smaller cells, rounded or ii'regular in shape. 5. Ciliated Epithelium is chai'acterised by the presence of minute conical vibratile filaments or cilia mounted on the broad ends of columnar cells, or upon the free surface of those of the si^heroidal kind. The cilia are in constant action, and produce a wave-like motion, which carries the secretions in contact with them towards the outlet of the organ in which they exist. They have an average measurement in the human trachea of to ^^oa of an inch. Ciliated eiuthelium is found (i) in the mucous Fig 14.â€”Cells of the columnar ciliated epi- thelium of the nose, magnified 310 times. membrane of the lower part of the nasal cavities and the adjoining accessory cavities ; (2) in the nasal duct and lachrymal sac ; (3) the Eustachian tube and cavity of the tympanum ; (4) the upper part of the pharynx and upper surface of the soft jjalate ; (5) the larynx (excepting over the true vocal cords), trachea, bronchi, and bronchial tubes to their smallest branches; (6) the uterus and its glands, and the entire length of the Fallopian tubes ; (7) the vasa efferentia and coni vasculosi of the testicle ; (8) some part of the ventricles of the brain, and the whole length of the central canal of the s]iinal cord ; (9) the ducts of the lingual and pharyngeal glands ; (10) in the embryo, lining the a'sophagus, over the whole pharynx and jiart of the mucous membrane of the stomach. Ciliated cells possess an intercellular and intcrnuclear network.

ENDOTHELIUM.â€”It has been said above that endothelium differs from epithelium in being derived from the mesoblast; another difference is that endothelial cells are never supported by a basement mem- brane. Endotheiium consists of flattened cell plates, held together at their edges by a cement substance which becomes stained brown when the surface is painted with a solution of nitrate of silver. The outlines of the cells thus made apparent are commonly irregular or jagged; more especially where the cells line the lymphatic vessels. Although the majority of the cells are thin and flat, there occur here and there in serous membranes groups of polyhedral or cubical thicker cells. Fig. 16.â€”Endothelium. Showing composed of granular protoplasm ; these â€¢^"'"ecUs^""^^""^ germinat- are sup])Osed to be in a condition of reproductive activity, and hence are described as germinating endo- thelium. Such cells generally border the lymphatic pores or stomata in the serous membranes. Endothelial cells are found lining the ciivities of the peritoneum, pleura, pericardiiim, and a(pieous chamber of the eye ; on the surface of the spinal cord and brain ; lining the heart, blood-vessels, and lymphatic vessels ; lastly, on the free sur- face of synovial membranes. CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Connective tissue forms the means of union between tlie several tissues and organs, forms coverings for the muscles and sheaths for the vessels, and constitutes the supporting framework for the cellular and other elements which make up the individual organs. It consists of fibres and of cells, the former greatly preponderating, and being easily divisible into two sets, elastic and non-elastic. Having many and various duties to perform, connective tissue is necessarily greatly diversified in its arrangement, differing also in different regions in the proportion of ceUs to fibres, and of the elastic fibres to the non-elastic. We may, however, readily dis- tinguish three cliief forms of connective tissue, each of which requires a separate and complete description ; these are the areolar (including the adipose), the fibrous, and the elastic. Areolar Tissue.â€”This consists of delicate fibres and transparent lamincc crossing each other in all directions, and leaving between them iiTegular interspaces or meshes, called areoke; these are occupied by a small quantity of clear colourless fluid, sufficient only12 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. to keep the tlireacls and lamina) moist, and laminae we can, by the use of reagcntf Fig. 17.â€”A portion of living connective tissue, cut out from between the muscles of tlio frog's thigh (highly magnified), a.

The celL- lie in a gelatinou.- semifluid substance (called the ground, substance), whicli joins the fibres of the tissue togethei-, making them into bundles, occupying in it cavities (called " cell spaces ") which coii'espond accurate! y to the shape and size of each cell. Be- sides the branched cells, there are also migratory or Avaiider cells, like found in areolar tissue a uuiiil)er of the white corpuscles of the blood, composed of protoplasm, and con taining one or more nuclei. These cells lia-\'e the power of moving from plaice to place, and they l)ecome especially numerous when the tissue undergoes intlammatiou. The fibres are very tine, measuring from Kal 5 0T)F5 to of an inch, and are apparently structureless By means of the ground suljstance they are united into bundles, which have a wavy course, and, when viewed by reflected light, ha\'e a white and shining appearance. Mixed with these we commonly find a number of coarser fibres, having a tendency to curl at their ends, and not gathered into Inindles ; acetic acid, which causes the bundles of hl)i'es to swell U]i and l)ecome indistinct, has no effect on these single fibres ; they will l)e more fully described in a later ]iagi' as yellow tissue, it constituting anasarca. Areolar tissue is found beneath the skin, forming a continuous layer all over the body ; beneath .serous and mucous meml)ranes ; around muscles, vessels, and nerves, form- ing sheaths for them, and connecting them with neighliouring or elastic fibres. From the loose arrangement of areolar is often sul)jecte(l during life to infiltration of fluid, this ])arts. It is also found connecting and supporting the lobules13 CONNECTIVE TISSUE, a con- of glands, and in tlie interior of organs supporting tlieir proper tissues. Adipose Tissue, or Fat, may be described as areolar tissue the meshes of which are occupiecl by vesicles containing oil. It is chiefly found immediately beneath the skin, forming there tinuous layer over nearly the whole surface of the bo"dy, the panniculus adiposus; it also exists very plentifully in the mesentery and omenta of the abdomen, round the joints, on the surface of the heart, round the kidneys, and entering into the formation of the marrow of bones. It consists of vesicles which measure from to of an inch, filled with oil; they are aggregated together so as to form little masses or lobules, and are contained in the meshes of areolar tissue. A nucleiis generally exists at one side of the vesicle, but is commonly obscured by the oily contents ; it is the I'emai'ns of the protoplasm of the cell from Avhich the vesicle was formed. The vesicles are usually glolnilar in form, unless they have been compressed, when they l:)ecome hexagonal or polyhedral. After death the contents of the vesicles often crystallise, appearing as groups crystals, which are supposed to consist chiefly of margaric acid. Each lobule of fattv tissue has entei'- FiG. 18.â€”Areolar and adipose tissue, a, a. Fat vesicles. 6, b.

No adipose tissue is found, in health, in the subcutaneous tissue of the eyelids or penis, nor in the lungs (except near their roots), nor in the cavity of the cranium. Fibrous Tissue.â€”This tissue forms the periosteum of bones, ligaments to bind the bones together, tendons for the attachment of muscles, strong pro- tecting coats for certain organs, and fasciae to separate the miiscles from each other. Thus two forms of it are describedâ€”the fascicular, where the fibres are gathered up into bundles so as to foi'm a i-ounded or flattened band, and membranous, where they are spread out so a.s to form a thin sheet. It is composed of fine filaments gathered into bundles, and having all the characters and properties of the white fibres described as forming the gi-eater part of areolar tissue. These are either arranged parallel to each other, as in the formation of tendons and ligaments, or they spread out, cross, and get inter- FiG. ir â€”Fat vesicles from omen- tum, .showing nuclei at the margins of the vesicles.CONNECTIVE TISSUE. 14 woven, so as to form a membranous slieet, as in fasciae and slieatlis of muscles. In tlie fascicular form white fibres exist almost exclusively ; in the membranous form there is a slight admixture of yellow elastic fibres. When a tendon is treated with acetic acid, the white fibi-es of which it is composed swell up and become transparent; there are then brought into view chains of ol)long flat- tened cells lying Ijetween the tissue ljundles ; these are nucleated, the nuclei of pairs of adjoining cells lying side by side. By the use of reagents it can be shown that these cells lie in cell spaces similar to those already described as lodging the cells of areolar tissue ; the cell spaces accurately correspond in size and shape to the cells which they Although the cells appear cubical in longitudinal view, transverse sections of the tendon shoAv them to be stellate, giving off nume- rous fine processes, which penetrate Ijetween contigu- ous bundles of the tendon. Fibrous tissue is white and glistening; it is very strong, Init is inelastic, un- less when intermixed with yellow fibres. It is con- verted into gelatine by boiling.

As an elastic and binding element it is present in the common areolar ti.ssue and superficial fascia, in the fascial sheaths of muscles, in the filÂ»rous capsules of different organs, as of the spleen, in the corium of the skin, in serous and mucous membi'anes, in the coats of blood-ves^sels and ducts ; and, in certain situations, is the sole tissue present, as in the ligamenta subflava, vocal cords, thyro-epiglottic ligament, crico-thyroid membrane, lateral thyro-hyoid and stylo-hyoid liga- ments, the memlii'anous layers connecting the cartilaginous rings of the trachea and l)ronchial tubes, and ligamentum suspensorium penis. It is most easily obtained from the ligamentum nucha) of the ox, sheej), or horse.CONNECTIVE TISSUE. 15 flattened, l)nttle, The filn'es of elastic tissue are c}'liudrical or colourless when single, but yellomsh in an aggregated form, elastic, admitting of being stretched to double their length and returning to their original size, and variable in dimensions, ranging from 04000 to joV)o an incli in width. They branch freely, and form communications or anastomoses with each other ; when cut or broken across, they curl up,â€”this character serving to distinguish them from the white fibres. They are homo- geneous in appearance, and are unaffected by acetic acid. Schwalbe has described numerous ilat connective tissue cells as lying in the ground substance between the fibres of elastic tissue. Isolated elastic fibres of ex- treme fineness are met witli coiled around or entwined among the fasciculi of areolar tissue holding them together. The elastic network formed by these fibres may be extremely fine and delicate, as in thin mem- branes ; or it may be coarser, as in the various ligamentous bands composed of this tissue ; or it may be spread out like a mem- brane, the interstices forming l)nt a small part of its extent, as in the fenestrated memhrane of the arteries. Elastic tissue does not, like fibrous tissue, yield gela- tine on boiling, hwi a peculiar substance called elastin, wliich is insoluble in water, acetic, acid, ammonia, or alcohol. Special Varieties of Con- nective Tissue.â€”Of these, three kinds deserve special mention, namely, mucous tissue, reti- cular tissue, and simple mem- brane.

In the early embryonic coiidilion all connective tissue con- sists of a pellucid jelly, in which nucleated corpuscles are embedded, and yields a chemical principle called mucin; in the viti-eous humour the cells disappear, only the jelly I'emaining, but in the um1)ilicul cord the cor'puscles branch and become con- nected so as to foi'in trabeculse, Ijetweeu which the jelly lies. Reticular Tissue is found in all lym- ]>hatic glands, in the phaiynx and tonsils, the solitary and agminate glands of the intestine, the thymus gland, and in tin- spleen. It consists of vamiiied nucleated cells, the branches of Avhich are .so con- nected with each other as to form a net- work, the meshes being commonly filled Avith lymi?li corpuscles. From its presence in lymphatic glands it has been named " adenoid" and " lymphoid " tissue. Simple Membrane was formerly siipposed to be structureless, but is now known to be made up of liattened cells united edge to edge. It forms a the membrana profvia or supporting meml)rane of the ejiithelial cells in mucous membrane and in secreting glands, and is often sjjoken of as basement metnhrane. PIGMENT.

CARTILAGE. Cartilage or gristle is a firm but easily cut, elastic, bluish-white substance, which coats the articular ends of long 1)ones, joins the ribs to the sternum, forms grooves for the passage of tendons, and in the embryo and young child occupies the place of bone, and is the substance from Avhich most of that tissue is formed. Tliree forms of cartilage are usually distinguishedâ€”hyaline, white fibro-cartilage, and yellow or elastic fibro-cartilage. Hyaline Cartilage is composed of a semi-transparent homogeneous substance called the matrix, containing a number of cells dispersed at short intervals through its structure. The cells may be evenly distributed throughout the matrix, as is the case in fcctal carti- lage, or may be gathered into grou])s, the members of which by their mutual pressure become changed in shape, and from being round or oval, as the single cells are, become flattened on one or two of their sides where they are in contact with their fellows. The cells have an average measurement of about foVu 3,n inch ; they lie in the matrix in cell spaces which are bounded by a capsule, but this is often indistinguishable in young cartilages. Some observers state that the matrix is permeated by numerous very line channels, which also pierce the capsules of the cartilage cells, and thus the cavities in which the cells lie communicate with n.CARTILAGE. i8 b.

The matri.v in some instances can be broken up l)y ])rolonged niaceru- .^^^ tion into line fil)rils, ha\ - '^â– 'â– ^ ing the siiine chemical charactei's as the fibres of connective tissue. Hya- line cartilages have been divided into temporanj, which ultimately become converted into l)one, and periimnent, which remain throughout the whole of life ; the majority of the latter are articular, that is, they coat the ends of the bones entering into Fig. 28.â€”Branchial cartilage of a tadpole, a. Group the formation of joints, of foiir cells separating from each other. 6. Pair costal cartilage the cells are lai'ge and are collected into groups; the matrix is traversed by patches of white fibres, and frequently contains vascular channels of considerable size ; it is very prone to calcification in old age. Articular cartilage forms a thin coating on the articular surface of bones ; it has a faintly granular matrix, wdiich has a tendency to split vertically to the surface. It is not covered by perichon- drium. The surface cells become branched, and gradually change their character where the synovial membrane joins the cartilage, so as at length to Ije indistin- guishable from the con- nective tissue coriDuscles of that membrane. Yellow or Elastic Fibro - Cartilage {Re- ticular Cartilage) is com- l)osed of cells {^^i^ of an inch in diameter), .sepa- rated from each other by an opaque, filirous, inter- cellular network, the breadth of the cells being considerably gi'eater than Fig. 29.-Yellow or elastic fibro-cartilagc, showing tliat of the intercellular cells in capsules and elastic fibres lu matrix. , , mi .-i structiu-e. 1 he fibres arc short, imperfect, loose in texture, and yellowisli ; they are un- affected by acetic acid and do not yield chondrin. Instances of I19 BONE. elastic fibro-cartilage are, the pinna, ej^iglottis, cornicula laiyngis, cuneiform cartilages, and Eustachian tube. White Fibro-Cartilage is comj)osecl of an interlacement of fibres of white fibrous tissue, containing in its meshes scattered groups of cai'tilage cells which take the place of, and sometimes have a similar arrangement to the tendon-cells described above. Fibro-cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups : inter- ai'ticular, stratiform, connecting, and circumferential. Instances of interarticular fibro-cartilages (menisci) are those of the lower jaAV, sternal and acromial end of the clavicle, wrist, and knee. The strati- form fibro-cartilages are such as form a thin coating to the grooves on bone through which tendons play. The connecting fibro-cartilages are the intervertebi'al substance and cartilage of the symphysis pubis. The circumferential fibro-cartilages are the glenoid and cotyloid. The invertebral discs are soft and pulpy in the centre, but firm and dense at their circumference ; the cartilage cells are sparsely distriljuted, but increase in number in the inner layers ; the pulp itself, however, usually contains no cartilage cells, but consists of a cell structure, embedded in a soft matrix, and is the remains of the chorda dorsalis of the embryo. Fici. 30.â€”White fibro-cartilage, showing cells (a) in capsules, and fibrillar matrix (6).

CX) Structure of Bone.â€”On examiiiing the section of a l)one, it will be found that there are two varieties of osseous tissue : one forming the exteriorâ€”hard, compact, dense ; the other occupying the intei'ioi' â€”spongy, cellular, cancellated. The Lest way to obtain a correct idea of the arrangement of l)one substance is to study tlie appearance presented by a long bone, such as the tibia, wliicli has been sawn longitudinally. The shaft is a hollow pillar, the walls of which are formed of dense bone. The hollow interior is the medullary cavity, and in the recent state is tilled with marroAV. The U])per and lower enlarged ends are formed of an exterior thin shell of compact bone which surrounds a beautiful spider-we1)like latticework of osseous threads, the meshes of wliich are also hlled with marrow. After complete maceration all the mendjranous and oily matters are removed, and the dried bony structure alone is visible. On close observation, it will be seen that the Avails of the pillar consist of fibres or plates arranged in the direction of the bone, and that the cancellated texture of the extremities is formed by the separation and divergence of threads of 1)one which proceed in the same direction as the walls till they reach and support the thin shell which encases the spongy texture of the end. The fibres diverge aiid decussate like the divisions of a Gothic window, and so enclose diamond- shaped spaces, which are the cancdli. This arrangement, which always has reference to the direction in which the bone is to bear pressure, adds greatly to the strength of the loose light part of the bones ; and this is further secured by little cross bars, wliich tie together the long slender fibres just de- scribed. The dense and s])ongy tissues are essentially the same in structure, and the difterence is simply in the decree of closeness with which the fibres are packed. A perpen- dicular section of the body of a vertebra (Fig. 32) shows an example of reticular or cancellated texture where the bars are parallel and straight, in accordance with the direction of the pressure. In^'ilat bones the osseous substance is arranged as two jilates of dense tissue, in some parts closely contiguous to each other, as in the scai)ula ; in others sejiarated ijy loose tissue, or even by liollow spaces, as in the bones of the skidl, where the intervening substance, in which the blood-vessels run, is called the diplo'e. The simplest arrangement of l)one substance is to lie found in the Fic. 31.â€”Section of head of tibia, to show the cancel- lated texture.21 BONE.

Opening for vena basis vertebrfe. ethmoid and spongy bones of the face, the tliin jjartitions of which are formed of a single plate of bone. This isnourished from the outside, no vessels entering into its substance. Bone exists in the form of plates or lamellte, which can be seen by ex- amining a thin slice of bone after it lias been softened by steeping in diluted hydrochloric acid. The fibrous character of the lamellDe can be demonstrated by tearing strips from softened bones, by which it will be seen that the direction of the plates is in that of the length of a bone. When thus torn asunder, the lamellae are found to be connected by fine perforating fibres, which pass vertically through several layers, and thus fasten them together ; they are believed to be comjoosed of white fibrous tissue. Periosteum.â€”This is a fibrous membrane which covers the ex- terior of all bones, except where they are encrusted with cartilage. It is a tough unyielding tissue, which adds to the strength and elas- ticity of the bones, and adhering very firmly, forms the means of attachment of the muscles and tendons. Its principal use is to attbrtl a support and l:)ed to the vessels entering the bone, and it may there- fore ha called the nourishing membrane to the exterior of the l)one. It consists of two layers. The outer, composed of fibrous tissue, supports the blood-vessels, and gives oft" filamentous threads which accompany the branches of the vessels into the Haversian canals ; on its inner aspect, this layer contains a considerable admixture of elastic fibres. The inner layer consists of a number of jDrotoplasmic cells (osteoblasts) which in the young bone aj)pear as granular cor- puscles, but in the old bone are found only as a flattened epithelial layer, separated from the rest of the periosteum by a narrow cleft or lymph space. Minute Structure of Bone.â€”A thin layer of the exterior of a bone derives its nourish- ment from the periosteum, and a similar layer of the inner sui'face is nourished by tlie vessels of the marrow, but in most bones there is a consideral)le amount of dense tissue, wliich is too far removed from either to draw its support therefrom, Tliis intervening portion is .supplied by 1)1ood-vessels which enter little channels pi'o- vided for the purpose. These Haversian canals, as they are called, are little tubes running for the most part in the direction of tlie length of a hone, Imt so obliquely as to form frequent comnumications with each other-, and tliose near the external and internal surfaces with these Fig. 33.â€”Plan of a section of a long bone. i.

Tlie wliole dense substance therefore is pei-- meated by a network of tubules, so that when a thin trans\-erse slice of bone is examined by the microscope, it is seen to be i-iddled. with circular holes. The Haversian canals measure from y^Jj^ to of an inch in diameter. A perpendiciilai' section shows the coin- munications with each other and with the surfaces of the Itone. They are largest near to tlie medullary surface of tlie bone, and ar-e narrowest next to the periosteal layer; they contain blood-vessels,, lymphatics, nerves, osteoblastic cells, and the larger ones contain marrow. That portion of the dense tissue which derives its nourishment from the Haversian canals is arranged in concentric lamellte {Haver- sian lamellce), round these tubes, so that a long bone may be described as a series of hollow rods, the central canals of which are the Haver- sian canals, bound together by an exterior wrapper consisting of several layers of lamellce (see Fig. 33). An Haversian canal and its concentric lamellae together form an Haversian system; as these systems are round or oval, irregular intervals are left where they join ; these are filled in by layers irregu- larly disposed and called interstitial or intercalary lamellce. A further provision exists for bring- ing the nutritive fluid into more close relation to the bone substance tlian can be accomplished by the vascular mem- branes or Haversian canals. The whole of the dense tissue is permeated hj ex- tremely minute channels called canali- culi. These pass through the periosteal and perimedullary layers at right angles to their surfaces, and radiate from the Haversian canals. They are smaller in cali]:)re than the smallest capillaries, and serve to conduct the nutritive fluid to the denser tissue. The canaliculi which radiate out from the Haversian canals are interrupted in their passage to the more distant concentric lamella?

The lacuna? thei'efoi'e serve as reservoirs into which fluid from the vessels in the Haversian canals is poured on the one hand, and on the other they pass it on to the outer circles of bone. In this way the nourish- ment of those parts of bone most distant fi-om the nutrient mem- branes is provided for by this intricate series of little cliannels and communicating reservoirs (flg. 35).23 BONE. Fig. 35.â€”Transverse section of a long bone, sliowiiig the Haversian systems, Haversian canals, concentric lamellaj, canaliculi, and lacunai. In recent bones the lacuna3 are occupied by nucleated masses of protoplasm, and the canaliculi by slender threads of the same sul)stance, liy means of which the masses in the lacunae com- municate with one anotlier. The lacunae and their corresponding canaliculi are to be found in all parts of a bone, and in bones howe\'er thin â€”although Haver- sian canals are only found in those of some thickness. In the periosteal and perimedullary layers of long bones, and in very thin bones, their arrangement has re- ference to the surface of the bone. In cancellous tissue the l)one spicules are devoid of Haversian canals, and the canaliculi open into the cancellous spaces; the latter are occupied by marrow, and hence are named vie- didlary spaces. Lymphatic vessels are found in the periosteum, and in the larger Haversian canals ; ner\ es are distri- ]mf(H\ tn the neriosteum 36.â€”Lacun* magnified 500 diameters, a. ijurm XO ine peiiosieum, central cavity.

In the modullary cavities of long bones it is found of a pale yellow colour and consists of fine, l)i'anching conneptive tissue corpuscles su])porting fat vesicles ; in the cancellated ends of long bones and in slioi't bones, the bodies of the verteljrae, sternum, and ribs, but es])ecially in the cranial diploii, it is reddish in colour, contains little fat, and is remarkable for the ])resence of a large number of round granular cells reseniljling the white corpuscles of the blood (lymphoid cells), and, like them, being capable of ama^boid movement. Amongst these are smaller cells which hava a faint red colour ; they are nucleated, and resemble the red corpuscles of the blood of the embryo. In both kinds of marrow there are24 BONE. also found large isolated cells with many nuclei, called giant cells or myeloflaxes. Development of Bone.â€”The majority of the bones are developed from cartilage, wliicli forms a mould of the same shape as the bone to l)e foi'med, but the tabular bones of the skull and nearly all the bones of the face are formed between two layers of mendjrane with- out the presence of cartilage, and after the bones have been once formed, their further enlargement or growth takes place chiefly by the deposit of osseous matter beneath the periosteum. We have thus three modes of ossificationâ€”intracurtilac/inotis, intramembranous, and subperiostealâ€”but as the two latter are essentially the same, only two forms fall to be described here. Intramembranous Ossification.â€”The bones formed without a preceding cartilaginous matrix are, the upper part of the frontal, parietal, upper part of occipital, nasal, lachrymal, palate, vomer, zygoma, upper ja^' and greater part of lower jaw, and inner layer of sphenoidal spongy bones (Kolliker). If we examine a parietal bone about the period of commencing ossification, we shall find that the intermediate space between the pericranium on the oiitside and the dura mater within is occupied by a membranous structure consisting of delicate translucent fibres, among which fusiform and stellate cells are distributed. In the centre of the bone a deposition of calcareous salts takes place in this membrane, and spreads from the centre towards the cir- cumference in radiating lines, connected together by trans^-erse bars irregu- larly disposed. The os- seous spicules are coated over with a soft trans- 23arent substance which lias been called "oste- ogen," and upon this groups of cells may be observed. The cells are very closely aggregated so as often comjdetely to cover the spicules ; they are granular in character, and of large size, and, as it is believed that they are the active agents in the production of bone, they have been named "osteoblasts." Many of the cells get embedded'in the new bone, and, being compressed by it, become irregular in outline ; lliey give off fine thi'cad-like processes, l)y means of which they com- municate with neighbouring cells. From Ilie presence of these cells and their processes, cavities and canals are necessarily left in the Fk;. 37.â€”Osteoblasts fiom the parietal bone of a human embryo thirteen weeks old. a.

Vessels penetrate from the surface into the growing bone, and becoming enclosed in the calcareous deposit, determine the formation of the Haversian canals, and, in the tabular bones of the skull, of the cranial diflo'e. As the ossification commences in the centres of tlie tabular bones and spreads to the circumference, their angles are necessarily the last to ossify, so that at the time of birth, and for some months afterwards, spaces are left Ijetween the bones, filled by membrane only. Intracartilaginous Ossification.â€”Before the commencement of ossification, the cartilage cells are small in size, have a rounded form, and are evenly distributed throughout the matrix. The first indication of ai^proaching ossification is, that these cells become more numerous, increase in and become oval in form.

Another noticeable feature may also be observed in a section of a bone in whicli ossification has com- menced, name- ly, that near the ossific cen- tre, the carti- lage cells come the new bone. Between these rows calcareous matter gets de- posited, form- ing trabecula), and as development advances, bands are tin-own across to join neighbouring trabeculoe; the rows of cartilage cells come thus to be enclosed in spaces (primary areoldi), the walls of which are formed by calcai'eous mattei'.

At the .same time, a deposit of bony matter is taking ])lace be- neath the periosteum, through the agency of the osteoblastic cells de26 BONE, sci'i])od above as lining its inner surface. This process is, in its essen- tial ]iavticulars, identical with intivi-niembranous ossification. Very soon, however, the vascular and osteoblastic subperiosteal tissm- penetrates into the cartilage oi the centre, and wdiere it couk^- in contact with the calcifietl matter causes its absorption, thus breaking down the walls of the primary areolae and form- ing larger spaces, called second- ary areolce or medullary spaces. Where this has taken place, it is found that in the spaces so formed, the cartilage cells have disappeared, and that the cavit} is hlled with embryonic mai- row, consisting of branched cell?, osteoblasts, and blood - vessels. Most of the osteoblasts are de- rived from the subperiosteal layer, Init it is probable that some ai'e formed fi*om the carti- lage cells. There are thus two jjrocesses going on at the same time, one an endosteal change, taking place in the cartilage, and the othei' an inti-usion ot cells of subperiosteal origin. The walls of the medullary spaces are at first very thin, but they soon l)ecome thickened l)y deposits in the osteoblasts by which they are lined. Some few of the osteoblastii cells become converted into scat - tered connective tissue, others i-etain theii' original sha]ie, and form the round or lymphoid cells of the medulla, while the largei' number ai'e the active agents in the production of bone. They line the medullary sinus, and a deposit of calcareous salts takes place in them ; us this de]tosition advances, layei' after layer of tlu- cells tiikes part in the process, and the deposition in successive layers around a central blooa-vessci results in the formation of concentrio lamina.' ai-ouud the Haversian Fio. <jo.â€”N'ertical section from the ossify- ing portion of the sliaft of a long bone, tt.

Many of the cells become embedded in tlie new deposit, md remain througliout life, the cavities in which they lie con- jtituting the lacunce, and by their communication with neighbouring cells they establish a series of smaller pores in the lione, which we have "spoken of as canaliculi. The medullary sinuses nearest the centre of a long bone become enlarged 1)}^ further absorption of their walls, and merge into each other, so as to form a single cavity, which is filled with marrow and remains as the medullary canal. Many of the smaller sjjaces also retain their marrow and are not filled up by bone ; they then form the cavitiesâ€”and their walls form the fine spiculesâ€”of cancellous tissue. The growth of long bones takes i^Rce in length by the further ossification of the groAving cartilage (efipliysial cartilage) be- tween the shaft and extremity, and in thickness by the deposition of new bone between the periosteum and the shaft, this being ahvays accompanied by reabsorption of the interior, so that the medullary canal becomes increased in size. This absorption is brought about by the agency of large cells of varying sliape and size, haAdng many clear nuclei, which are numerous in foetal marrow and have lieen spoken of above as myeloplaxes or giant- cells ; here, hoAvever, they receive the name of osteoclasts. Subperi- osteal growth takes place by a process identical in all essential particulars with what we have described above as intraniembranoixs ossification. Cartilaginification is complete in the human embryo at about the sixth week ; and the first point of ossification is observed in the clavicle at about the fifth week. Ossification commences at the centre, and thence ])roceeds towards the surface ; in flat bones the o.sseous ti.ssue radiates between two membranes from a central point towards the periphery, in short bones from a centre towards the circumference, and in long bones from a central portion, diaphysis, towards a secondaiy centre, epiphysis, situated at each extremity. Large processes, as the trochanters, are i)rovided with a distinct centre of development. MUSCLE. Muscles are the moving organs of the animal frauie ; they con- stitute by their size and number the great bulk of the bodyj upon which they bestow form and symmetry. In the limbs they are situated around the Ijoues, which they invest and defend, while they form to some of the joints a principal protection. In the trunk they are spread out to enclose cavities and constitute a de- fensive wall, capable of yielding to intei-nal pressure, and again returning to its original petition. Their colour presents the deep red which is characteristic of flesh, and their form is vai'iously modifled, to execute the varied range of movements which they are required to efl\;ct.28 MUSCLE. Muscular fibres are of two kinds, voluntary and involuntary tlie former are the most numerous, foiiiiing tlie great musculaij masses whicli move tlie sevei al parts of the body ; tlie iuvoluntaryt muscular fibres assist in forming the walls of "the hollow viscera^ and the middle coat of arteries and veins ; they are also found ini the iris, ciliary muscle, and the bronchial tuljes. Peculiarities ini their stinicture also lead to muscular fibres being distinguislied asÂ« striated and non-striated, the striated being voluntary in Iheirr action, and the non-striated involuntaiy, with the exception of the; heart, which, altliough involun-- tary in its action, is composed I of striated muscular fibre. Striated or voluntary mus- cular fibres are collected into bundles, held together by deli- cate ai'eolar tissue, and enclosed in a sheath or perimysium, foimed of areolar tissue, with an admixture of elastic tissue, which also sends processes in- wards between the fibres {e7i- doviysium). These bundles are called fasciculi, they are pris- matic in shape, and of difterent sizes in difterent muscles, the ajjparent coarseness or fineness of a muscle depending chiefly on the size of the fasciculi. The fibres themselves are cy- lindrical, or oval in shape, and are nearly uniform in sizt\ They average to of an inch in diameter, but in the facial muscles the fibres are much finer, some of them not 41.â€”I.

So delicate is this structure that it only becomes visible when the contained fibrils become ru])tured, as in fig. 41. It is rather tough, and resembles elastic tissue in its physical and chemical properties. When examined under a high niicrosco])ic power the muscular fibres are found to l)e marked at regular intervals by transA-erse striic ; these are the characteristic markings which dis- tinguish this kind of muscle, not only from the unstrii)ed variety, but* also from e\-ery other tissue in' the body. The stripes are alternately light and dark, each stripe being about ^-^l^ of an29 MUSCLE. inch in width The light stripe is crossed by a fine dotted line or secondary dark stripe {DoUe's line, or Krause's memhrane). Some anatonaists suppose that the dark portions are occupied by a peculiar semi-fiuid material, called "sarcows matter" (the individual dark spaces being called sarcous elements"), and the lighter por- tions of a more fluid and hence less highly refracting matter The dark stri])e is sometimes crossed by a band of a slightly paler tint; this is described as the median disc of Hensen. The light stripe is divided by Dobie's line into twoportions, which have been named the lateral discs of Engelmann. In many muscular fibres, but especi- ally in those of in- sects, high micro- scopic powers show the dark stripe to be made up of minute rods {muscle-rods) with light intei'vals be- tween them ; the I'ods are thicker at their ends and thinner and lighter in their middle. After the fibres liave been hard- ened in alcohol or solution of osmic acid, they can readily l)e divided by means of needles into longitudinal filaments or fibrils, but even these may be still further divided, the finest of the fila- ments so oljtained presenting the appearance of a series of minute dots. Under other modes of preparation, and especially by the action of hydrochloi'ic acid, a transverse cleavage may take place, resulting in a serie''. of minute discs (Bowman's discs). Whether either of these modes of division corresponds to a normal line of union of elementary jjarts has never^ yet been satisfactorily deter- mined, some observers believing the primitive fibrils to constitute câ€”-.

The brain and spinal cord constitute the great nervous centre, or cerebro-spinal axis, and the great majority of the nerves spring from this centre or are connected with it. Theri' also exists a secondary system oi' nerves called sympathetic, the cen- tres of which occur in the form of numerous minute masses named ganglia, which are distributed chiefly in the thorax and alxlo- men, and are intimately connected with the nerves going to the organs contained in those cavities. The sympathetic and cerebro-spinal nerves have frequent communica- tions with each other, which form complicated net\\'orks or j^lexiLScs. The nerve tissues are readily separable into two forms, the white and the grey; the former con.sti- tutes the greater portion of the interior of the brain, the outer part of the spinal cord, and all the nerves which spring from these ; the latter exists in the in- terior of the spinal cord, on llie surface of the brain, in the in- terior of the Ijrain near its l);ise, and in the sympathetic and cere- The structural elements of the nervous systemNERVE FIBRES. ;u'e al.so of two kinds, nerve fibres and nerve cells. The ftlires form the channels of com- munication Ijetween the centres and the organs, and when gathered together into hundles form nerves ; the cells are restricted in their distribution to the nerA'e centres, ganglia, and certain of the organs of sense. . NERVE FIBRES are of two kindsâ€”white or medullatecl, and grey or non-medullated. The white or medullated nerve fibres form the white matter of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. When examined imme- diately after removal from the body they seem to be structureless, and are lionnded Ijy a wavy outline. In a short time, howe'S'er, their ajipearance changes, and they come to present a doul)le boundary line ; the fibre now consists of three parts, an outer delicate, transparent covering, a central thread, firm and solid in consistence, and between these a substance which has a wavy or irregular margin, and often a nodulated aspect. The outer layer is called the iij-imi^tve sheath or neurolemma; it is so fine and transparent as to be difficiilt of demonstration, and, indeed, it is only when a break takes place in the substance of the fibre that it becomes visible ; it is elastic and apparently structureless. The j)rimitive sheath disappears when nerves enter the substance of the brain or spinal cord, and is also al:)sent from many ner-s'es in their peripheral distribution. Beneath the primitive sheath at wide intervals are small nucleated masses of proto- plasm ; they are the nerve corpuscles; they correspond to the nuclei found beneath the sarcolemma of muscle, but are much less numerous. The pulpy substance which lies between the primitive sheath and the central thread is called the medullary sheath {lohite matter of Schwann). It is viscous, clear, transparent, and easily susceptible of coagulation, and is convertecl in its coagulated state into an opaque, granular, white substance. It is found to consist to a large extent of fatty matter, and, after nerves have been some time removed from the body, becomes ir- regular in outline, its margins l)ecome -r Fill. 47.â€”Medullated nerve fibre, a.

The centre of the fil)re is formed l:>y a firmer and more homogeneous band called the axis cylinder. It is elastic, greyish in colour, has a very faint and indistinct boundary line, and is generally flattened or oval in transverse section ; it is al)Out one-thii-d the thickness of the nerve fibre. It often presents traces of longitudinal striation, and may occasionally be split up into fine filaments, this taking place especially at the commenceuient and termination of a nerve ; these filaments have been regarded hy some observers as the ultimate structural elements of the nerve, and ha\'e hence been called jyrimitive fibrillce. Each axis cylinder is continuous with one of the jioles of a ganglionic cell. It is distinguished from the other parts of the nerve fibre by its becoming deeply coloured, when a thin section of fresh nervous matter is placed in a solution of carminate of ammonia, A\diile the primitive sheath becouies only faintly tinged, and the medullary sheath is totally unaftected by the reagent. The axis cylinder has also a great affinity for gold salts, becoming stained violet-black when placed in solutions of them ; when treated with nitrate of silver and exposed to light it shows transverse striae, these lieing most marked near to the nodes of Eanvier ; they are known as Frommann's lines. Nodes of Eianvier.'â€”Medullated nerve filires present breaks in the continuity of their structure at intervals of about ^ of an inch. At these points the axis cylinder is continued uninterruptedly ; the primitive sheath also passes over the breaks, but as the fibre is here smaller than elsewhere, the sheath is drawn inwards towards its centre. The medullary sheath is, however, completely interrupted, terminating by a rounded edge. The primitive sheath is separated from the axis cylinder by a small quantity of material of an albu- minous character, and corresponding in its behaviour Avith reagents to the intercellular suljstance which Ave have sjjoken of, as cementing together neighbouring cells. These breaks in the nerve fibre ha^'e been named from their discoverer the Nodes of Ranvier. Non-meduUated or Gelatinous Nerve Fibres (fibres of Remak) are found in the great nerve centres as continuations of the medul- lated fibres ; they also constitute the greater niunlier of the fibres of the sympathetic, and the whole of the olfactoi'v ner^-es in uian. In the brain and spinal cord, they are connected with the processes of the multipolar ner^^e cells, and serve to connect the medullated fibres with those cells. They are pale in colour, fiattened, and bounded by single contour lines ; they measure from g^J^ to of an inch in diametei'. In structure they are ioxmd to consi.st of a transparent, apparently honiogeneous slieath corresponding to the primitive sheath of the medullated fibres, l)eneath which are numerous oval nuclei.

No distinct limiting membrane or cell Avail lias been ascertained to exist, but each cell is lodged in a kind of capsule composed of fine connective tissue, and lined by a delicate layer of flattened epithelial cells. The cell processes are composed of protoplasm of the same natui'e as the cell itself ; they also present traces of filu'illation, and are likewise destitute Fio 50 â€”JIultipolar ganglion cells from the brain, i.

One or more jtroeesses of each nerve cell may be traced into a nerve fibre, becoming continuous with the axis cylinder of the fibre ; other processes become continuous with the "poles" of neighbouring cells. From the fact that nerve cells were first discovered in ganglia, they are often called "ganglion cells ;" the true ganglion cell, however, differs from the cells above described, in respect that the primitive sheath of the nerve fre- quently is continued as a covering over the cell, and in some37 NERVE GANGLIA. instances the medullary sheath also may be traced as a thin coating over its exterior. Neuroglia.â€”The proper substance of the nervous centres (nerve fibres and nerve cells) is supported by a peculiar modification of connective tissue, described by Virchow under the name of neuroglia. This bears a close resemblance to the reticular tissue, described on a previous page, consisting of a reticulum formed by the intercoia- niunication of processes of greatly branched cells. Besides this, there exists a finely granular matrix, in which the nerve cells are embedded. GANGLIA.â€”In its widest signification a ganglion is a nervous centre, whether found in the interior of the brain or spinal cord, or existing in an isolated posi- tion, remote from those great aggregations of nerve matter ; in a more restricted sense it is limited to those small secondary centres found in large numbers throughout the sympathetic system in con- nection with the roots of the spinal nerves, and on the trunks, or connected with some of the branches of the cerebral nerves. Ganglia have a fibrous covering, continuous \vith the sheath of the nerves entering and leaving them ; from this capsule processes are sent into the interior of the ganglion, dividing it into compartments. The interior of the ganglion is of a greyish coloui', and consists of nerve cells and nerve fibres, sup- jiorted hj connective tissue. The nei've cells are round, oval, or multipolar, and are covered by a continuation of the primitive sheath of the nerves, and sometimes also hj the medullary sheath. Some of the nerve fibres pass through the ganglion witlioiit becoming connected with the cells, others terminate in the bi'anches of the multi]Dolar cells, their axis cylinder becoming continuous with the protoplasm of the cell ]n'o- cess. Large ]iyriform ganglion cells are occasionally found in the sympathetic system ; every ganglion cell of this kind is connected with at least two nerve fibres, one of which is straight, and passes directly to the centre of the cell ; the other winds spirally round the first, and is traceable for some distance on the outer surface of the cell. According to Arnold the central fibre is connected with the Fjg. a, 51.â€”Sketch of a synipatliotic ganglion. b, c. Nerve trunks, d. Multipolar cells.

A commissure is a col- lection of nei-\e fibres act- ing as a link of communi- cation between two nerve (centres. A nerve is a rounded oi' flattened cord of nerve fibres ^vhich forms the channel of connection between tlu; ner\ e centi'es and all the parts of tlie body. The nerve cords aie surrounded by a strong sheath of -fibrous membrane called epineurmm, which not only preserA'es their rounded form, but forms se])ta which pass into the interior of the cord, subdividing it into a number of strands or funiculi. Each funiculus is also surrounded by a membrane called perineurium^ composed of fine connecti^'e tissue arranged in concentric lamelliie, with lymph clefts be- tween them; in the surface laj^ers, there is a preponderance of elastic tissue. Tlie lamellae are lined on both their surfaces by a single layer of flattened epithelial cells. The nerve fibres in each funiculus are held together by very fine connective-tissue fibres, forming the endoueuriuvi; thesi- run longitudinally, and serve to support the blood-vessels distri- buted to the nerve. Branching of Nerves.â€”A branch of a nerve consists of several funiculi which leave the parent trunk and become in- vested with an epineuriiim de- rived from its sheath.

In the nervous centres, however, in the peripheral dis- triluitioii of the nerves, and, in rare instances, in their trunks, the fibres themselves branch and form communications, so as to pro- duce a true anastomosis. Nerve tubules by their medullary sheath are insulated throughout their whole course. Plexus.â€”A plexus is an intricate intercommunication between the funiculi of adjacent nerves. Origin.â€”The apparent origin of a nerve is where it Ijecomea connected with the surface of a nerve centre. The real origin is where its fibres terminate in the substance of its nerve centre- often far away from where it plunges into the nerve surface. It is very difiicult to trace accurately the deeper connections of the ex- trenaties of nerve fibres, Init as in many instances they have been observed to be directly connected with multii)olar cells, the opinion is becoming general that all nerve fibres have a central connection Avith a nerve cell. NERVE TERMINATIONS.â€”Nerve fibres, whether of the inedul- lated or non-inedullated variety, when they approach their termi- nation, freely branch, and form numerous communications among themseh'es, the medullated fibres lose their medullary sheath, and Ijecome indistinguishable from the non-medullated kind. The axis cylinder takes part in the branching of the fibres, and becomes H]jlit u]i into very fine threads, consisting of only a few elementary fil)rils. The primitive sheath is continued as a covering to the divided fibres, for some distance after they ha^^e lost their medullary sheath, but at length becomes also lost; and the fine pale fil^rils Avhich form the termination of the nerve may then be traced as faint lines having a wavy course, and marked at short intervals by irregular varicosities. Sensory or afferent nerves and motor or efferent nerves have very dift'erent modes of termination, and require therefore a separate description. Sensory Nerve Endings.â€”Sensory nerves terminate either in ei)ithelial cells, as in the cornea and skin, or by special terminal organs, some of which fall to l)e described here, while others will come under consideration in the description of the organs of sense to Avhich they belong. We shall in this place sjDeak only of the Facinian corpuscles, and the end bulbs of Krause, leaving the rods and cones of the retina, the cells of Oorti and acoustic filaments oi the interna] ear, the taste buds of the tongue, the olfactory cells of the nose, and the tactile corfiLscles of the skin to be discussed in the description of the organs in which they are found. The Pacinian or Vater's Corpuscles are small oval or pyriform masses, varying in size from half a line to three lines in length, situated on the peripheral extremities of the nerve fibres, chiefly in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, but also found in other parts, as the })enis and clitoris, bulb of the urethra, on the intercostal nerves, branches of the sacral plexus, on the cutaneous nerves of theNERVE TERMINATIONS. 40 neck, fU'ni, and leg, and dorsum of the hand and foot, infraorhital nerve, and on the nerves of the periosteum, nipple, and mamma, and those distributed to joints. It has been calculated that in the palm oi the hand and ]ialmar surface of the fingers thei-e are six hundred of these bodies, and at the extremities of the fingers thev are especially numerous. They are situated for the most part in tlie subcutaneous areolar tissue, are clear, ti'anspai'ent, and glistening in appearance, and traversed intei-nally witli white streaks. In struc- ture a Pacinian l)ody is composed of from twenty to sixty concentric layers or capsules of areolar tissue, separated by spaces containing lymph, and having a central cavity also filled with lymjih whicli contains the free extremity of a nerve fibre, divested of its sheath and medulla and reduced to the condition of a'n axis cylinder. Tlie intercaj^sular spaces are wider between the external than the internal layers, and each cajisule is lined by a single layer of squamous epitbelial cells ; neighbouring capsules are often branched and connected with each other by fibres. The central stalk of the corpuscle consists of the medullated nerve fibre entering it, and the sheath of the nerve may be ti-aced into the outer layers of the capsule. The axis cylinder included within the central cavity endsNERVE TERMINATIONS. soft substance in a small rounded tubercle, and not unfrequently is bifid or even The end bulbs of Krause have been ascertained to exist in the sclerotic conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, the soft palate and tongue, the lips, and in the skm of the glans penis and glans clitoi-idis. They are usually spheroidal or oval m shape, and measure aljout of an inch in diameter. They con- j^ist of a capsule of connective tissue containing a which is transparent and apparently granular, and has embedded in it numerous oval nuclei. A medul- lated nerve fibre enters its under surface, and as it passes in, generally loses its medullary sheath ; the axis cylinder may be traced into the cen- tral matrix, where it terininates by diAading into two or more In'anches. They thus closely resemble the Pa- cinian corpuscles. The end bulbs which pass to the genital organs differ in some respects from those just described, and have been named (jenital nerve corpuscles; they are characterised by the existence of numerous constrictions which give them a mulberry-like appearance. Motor Nerve Endings. â€” Of these there are two varieties; namely, those passing to striated muscle, and those distributed to the non-striated. The former have received the name of motoricU end plates. The nerves passing to a voluntary muscle retain their medullary sheath, and primi- tive sheath, till tliey reach the sar- colemma, when the former ceases, and the latter becomes continuous with the sarcolemma. The axis cylinder pierces the sarcolemma and expands l)eneath it, so as to pro- diice a prominence {nerve eminence)., often divided into lobes, and containing many clear oval nuclei. In unstriped oi- involuntary muscle the nerve fibres are arranged in very fine plexuses over the surface of the muscle cells, and some histologists state that the terminal filaments can be traced into the nucleus or nucleolus of the cell. SYMPATHETIC NERVE.â€”The sympathetic or ganglionic nerve, or system of organic ncrA^es, has received its various designations from its numberless communications and anastomoses, from its coui- Via. 56.â€”End bulbs, i.

It consists of a cord of moderate thickness, which extends from the head to the coccyx, lying by the side of the vertebral column ; of a series of ganglia, some of which are fusiforni and others flattened and multangular ; of short branches of communi- cation from the spinal nerves ; and of jjeripheral Ijranches, which for the most jiart follow the trunks of arteries, and are distributed to the viscera, after uniting with ganglia in tlieir course, or forming smaller ganglia in their distribution. The elementary constituents of the ganglionic nerve are : meduUated nerve liljres of every degree of magnitude from coarse to fine, n'on-niedullated or ganglionic nei-ves, and nerve cells. The medullated nerve fibres are derived from the â–  anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, chiefly from the latter ; enteiing the ganglion, they divide into an ascending and descending fasciculus, which pass upwards and downwards along: the main trunk of the nerve, or jDass oft" with the larger branches â€¢ in company with ganglionic nerves. The non-medullated fibres â€¢ originate in the multipolar cells of the sympathetic ganglia. In their peripheral terminations the branches of the sympathetic nerve present numerous minute, almost microscopic ganglia, which. are especially remarkable on the carotid arteries, in the pharyngeal! plexus, upon the heart, around the root and in the substance of the lungs, upon the supra-renal capsule, on the lymphatic glands, oni the posterior wall of the urinary bladder, and in the kidneys. In i structure these ganglia are identical with the larger ganglia. BLOOD-VESSELS. The blood is distriljuted throughout the body by means of a series- of tubes, which proceed from the heart, ramify through all the organs - and tissues, and again return to the heart; thus the blood in its- course constantly returns to the centre from whence it Avas sent forth,. and it is this which constitutes the circulation. The tubes which i carry the blood are called blood-vessels ; they are of three kindsâ€” namely, those which convey the blood froui the heart to the tissues,. arteries ; those which run through the tissues and organs, capil- â€¢ laries ; and tliose by means of which the blood is returned from the tissues to the heart, veins. The artery proceeding from the leff ventricle of the lieart contiiins- the pure or arterial lilood, which is distributed throughout the entire system, and constitutes -with its returning veins the greater or sys- â–  temic circulation. That which eniiuiates from the right ventricle conveys the impure blood to the lungs ; and with its corresponding: veins establishes the lesser or imlmonary circulation.AETERIES. 43 ARTERIES. Tlie arteries are tlie cylindrical tul)e.s which convey the blood from the ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. They are dense in structure, and preserve for the most part the cylindrical form when eni];)tied of their l)lood, which is their condition after death : hence they were considered by the ancients as the vessels for the transmission of the vital spirits, and were therefore named arteries (drjp Trjpeiv, to contain air). The whole of the arteries of the systemic circulation proceed from a single trunk, named the aorta, from which they are given off as branches, and divide and subdiAdde to their ultimate ramifications, constituting the great arterial tree which pervades by its minute .subdivisions every part of the animal frame. From the aorta the branches for the most part pass off at i-ight angles, as if for the purpose of checking the impetus with which tlie blood would other- wise rush along their cylinders from the main trunk ; but in the linilis a very different arrangement exists ; the branches are given off from the principal artery at an acute angle, so that no impedi- ment may be offered to the free circulation of the blood. The division of arterie^i is usually dichotonious, as of the aorta into the I wo common iliacs, common carotid into the external and internal, ^^c. ; but in some few instances a short trunk divides suddenly into several l)ranches which proceed in different directions : this mode of division is termed axis, as the thyroid and cocliac axis. In the division of an artery into two branches, it is observed that the combined ai'ea of the two branches is somewhat greater than that of the single trunk ; and if the combined area of all the bi'aiiclies at the periphery of the body were compared with that of the aorta, it would l)e seen that the blood, in passing from the aorta into the numerous distributing Ijranches, was flowing through a conical space, of Avhicli the apex might be represented by the aorta, and the base by the surface of the body. The advantage of this jn-ovision in facilitating the circulation is sufliciently oljAdous ; for the increased channel Avhicli is thus provided for the current of the blood, serves to compensate for the retarding influence of friction, resulting from the distance of the heart and the division of the vessels. The main arteries of the limbs run on the flexor aspect, as they are in that situation less liable to external injury or to over-stretching in tlie luoveuient of the joints, than if placed on the extensor aspect. Communications between arteries are free and numerous, and increase in frequency with the diminution in size of the branches ; so that, through the medium of the minute ramifications, the entire body may be considered as one uninterrupted circle of inosculations or anastomoses {dva, between, o-ro/za, mouth). This increase in the frequency of anastomosis in tlie smaller branches is a provision for counteracting the greater liability to impediment existing in themSTRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. 44 than in the larger branches. Wliere freedom of circulation is (jf vital inq^ortance, this communication of the arteries is very remai k- able, as in the circle of Willis in the cranium. It is also strikingly seen in situations where obstruction is most likely to occur, as iut the distribution to the alimentary canal, around joints, or in the hand and foot. Upon this free communication existing evei'ywhere between arterial liranches is founded the principle of cure by the ligature of large arteries ; the ramifications of the branches given offl from the artery above the ligature inosciilate with those which pro- â€¢ ceed from the trunk of the vessel below the ligature; these anas-- tomosing branches enlarge and constitute a collateral circulation,, in which several large l)ranches perform the office of the single- obliterated trunk. Ai'teries pursue a fairly straight coui'se, l)ut in .some parts they â–  are tortuous ; this is the case in the arteries of the lips and uterus,. and in those passing up to the base of the brain. In some in.stances â€¢ the tortuous course is to permit of free motion of the parts crossed by the vessel; in other.s â€¢ it appears to have the effect of diminishing the force of the propulsion of' the blood. Structure of Arteries.. â€”Arteries are composed of three coats, external,. middle, and internal. The external coatt {tunica adventitia) is firm and strong; it is thin in the large arteries, Init' thicker than the middle coat in arteries of small and medium size, and is- composed of white fibrous - and elastic tissue. The white fil)res are arranged in close bundles, which run for the most part dia- gonally or obliquely across â€¢ the vessel ; they form by their inter- communica- tion a firm felted mem- with minute in- which lie a Drane, m Fifi. 57.â€”A small artery.

Among the white fibres a few elastic fibres are found; these are most numerous in the inner layers (that is to say, near the middle coat), and are arranged longitudinally. The interlacement of the fibres is closest in the inner layers, and becomes looser as we approachSTRUCTUEE OF ARTERIES. 45 Fig. 58.â€” Smooth muscular fibre cells from the middle coat of the artery. i.

Longitudinal bands of unstnped muscular fibre have been desci'ibed as existing in the outer coat of many of the larger arteries, such as the splenic, renal, mesenteric, axillary, popliteal, and femoral. The middle coat {tunica media) is in all arteries the thickest and most important. It is composed of many layers of unstriped muscular fibres, mth, in the larger arteries, the addition of elastic tissue, and a small quantity of white fibrous tissue ; these structures are almost entirely arranged trans^'ersely. This coat is very brittle, and hence is easily cut through when a ligature is applied. The imdriped nms- cular tissue is almost the only component structure of the middle coat of small arteries ; in which there are two or three laminae, the fibres, about ^-^jm of an inch in diameter, ana jjj,y to arranged in rings ; in smaller arteries there lamina, the elements of the fil)res being shorter, and in proportion as the ai'teries are more minute, becoming reduced to the earliest developmental formâ€”namely, short elliptic cells with oblong nuclei ; ultimately they are completely lost. The elastic tissue is absent altogether in the middle coat of small arteries, hut makes its appearance in arteries of medium size as fine fibi'es disposed in a network of wide meshes. In the larger kind of medium-sized arteries, the elastic network is mingled with areolar tissue, and a tendency to the alterna- tion of these tissues begins to be apparent. While thus encroaching as it were on the structure of the middle coat of arteries, the elastic tissue presents a corresponding series of transitional forms ; at first it exists as fine fibres dis])Osed singly or in a fine network with open meshes ; then the fil)res become larger and the meshes closer, and interlaced so as to form a fibrous membrane with narrow meshes ; next, l:iy the crease of breadth of their fibres and their intimate union or fusion, "-inogeneous membrane is formed, in which the meshes appear as simple ]jerforations (fenestrated membrane). In medium-sized arteries the elastic tissue forms a single laver Iving external lo the Fig. 59. brane strated middle carotid horse. â€” Elastic mem- of the fene- kind, from the coat of the artery of a m- aSTRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. 46 inuRcular fibres ; in the lai-gest artei'ies of this class it is ininglcil with areolai' tissue, and exliibits a tendency to become laminated, the lamina) alternating with siuiilai' layers of areolar tissue.

The internal coat (tunca intima) is the thinnest of the tln-ee, and easily broken in the transverse direction ; it is composed of three layers, an internal layer or endothelium, a subendothelial layer, and an external elastic membrane, which is either homogeneous or made up of elastic elements, disposed in a longitudinal direction.

The arteries in their distribution through the body are included in a loose areolo-fibroiis investment which separates them from sur- I'ounding tissues, and is called a sheath. Around the principal vessels the sheath is an important structure ; it is composed of areolar tissue, intermingled with aponeurotic fibres, and is continuous with the fascia? of the region in which the arteries are situated, as with the thoracic and cervical fascia in the neck, transversalis and iliac fascia, (fascia lata in the thigh, &c. The sheath of the arteries contains also their accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. The coats of arteries are supplied with blood like other oi'gans of the Ijody ; their vessels proceed from the neighbouring small branches, and are named vasa vasorum. The vasa vasorum or vasa nutritia are distributed in the external coat, some few making their way among the external layers of the middle coat. They are met with even on the smallest arteries, and form a rich capillary network with rounded meshes. The small A^eins which return the blood from the capillaries, open into the companion veins of the artery. The nerves, like the A^asa vasorum, are found only in the external coat, and are wanting altogether in many arteries, as in those of the I cerebral and spinal substance, the choroid membrane of the OA'um, : the placenta, and also in the arteries of some muscles, glands, and f membranes. Lymphatic vessels and lymph spaces are present in the outer coat. CAPILLARIES. The arteries do not terminate directly in veins, but in an inter- mediate system of vessels which, from their minute size (about ^^^^ of an inch in diameter), are termed capillaries {capillus, a hair). The capillaries constitute a microscopic netAvork, Avhich is distributed through nearly every part of the body, so as to render it impossible to introduce the smallest needle-point beneath the skin Avithoiit Avounding several of these fine vessels. It is through the medium of the capillaries that all tlie phenomena of nutrition and secretion are performed. They are remarkable for their uniformity of diameter and for the constant divisions and communications Avhieh take jDlace betAveen them, Avithout any alteration of size. They communicate on the one hand Avith the terminal branches of the arteries and on the other Avith the minute radicles of the veins. In the maternal part of the placenta and in the erectile oi'gans (as the corjDus caver- nosum penis), the arteries empty into lacunar spaces, from Avhich the veins gather up the blood, Avithout the intei'vention of capillaries ; aud an ai'i-ingement some.Avhat similar is also found in the spleen.'

Structure of Capillaries.â€”Tlie capillaries are tlie smallest and sinqjlest of the blood-ve.ssels, iheii' wall being foi'ined by a single layer of flattened endotlielial cells, the edges of which can be brought into view by j)encil]ing the surface with nitrate of silver. The cells are irregular in shape, being often pointed at their extremities and sinuous at their edges. They are united togethei- by an albuminous cementing substance, and are connected e.xternally with the pro- cesses of the connective-tissue corpuscles of the neighbouring ti.ssue.s (Klein). During intlammatifm, the connecting cement of the cells often gives way so as to leave pores or stomata, through which the white corpuscles of the blood (and occasionally the red ones) pass. In certain parts the capillai'ies have, in addition to their endothelial lining, an outer coat, formed by a net^'ork of branched connective- tissue cells. Although capillaries are, as stated al)ove, remarkable for their they differ in this respect in different localities, l)eing smalle.st in the brain and lung, and largest in the mari'ow of bones ; the)' are small also in muscle and large in skin and mucous membrane. They ditter greatly in the size and arrange- ment of the meshes which they form, and consequently in the amount of blood Avhich they supply to the tis- sue.s, the network l)eing very close in the lungs and choroid coat of the. eye, in most mucous membranes and in glands, and very wide in ligaments, tendons, and similar structures. In muscle, nerve, and tendon the meshes of ihe capillary plexus are long and narrow ; in the lungs, adipose ti.ssue, and secreting glands they are rounded or polygonal ; while in the skin and mucous mem-, branes the capillaries ai-e drawn out into long loops.49 VEINS. VEINS. The veins care tlie vessels which return tlie hlood to the heart, after it has been circuhxted by tlie arteries through the various tissues of the body. They are much thinner in structure than the arteries, so that when emptied of their blood they become flattened and collapsed. The -veins of tlie systemic circulation convey the dark-coloured and impure or venous blood from the capillary system to the right auricle of the heart, and they are found after death to be more or less dis- tended witli that fluid. The veins of the pulmonary circulation contain during life the pure or arterial blood, which they transmit fro]n the capillaries of the lungs to the left auricle. The veins commence by minute branches which are continuous with the cajjillaries, and convei'ge to constitute larger and larger brandies, till they terminate in the main trunks which convey the venous 1.)lood directly to the heart. In diameter they are larger than the arteries, and, like those vessels, their coml)ined arese would con- stitute a hollow cone, whereof the apex is placed at the heart, and the base at the surface of the body. It follows from this arrange- ment, that the blood in returning to the heart is jiassing from a larger into a smaller channel, and therefore that it increases in rapidity during its course. Veins admit of division into superficial and deep. The Sui)erficial veins return the blood from the integunient and superficial structures, and take their course between the layers of the superficial fascia ; they then pierce the deep fascia in the most convenient and protected situations, and terminate in the deep veins. They are unaccompanied by arteries, and are the vessels usually selected for venesection. Tlie Deep veins are situated among the deeper structures of the body, and generally in relation with the arteries ; in the limbs they are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and they return the venous blood from the capillaries of the deep tissues. In com- pany with all the smaller, and also with the secondary arteries, as the ])rachial, radial, and ulnar in the upper, and the tibial and peroneal in the lower extremity, there are two veins placed one at each side of the artery, and named vencti comites. The larger arteries, as the axillary, subclavian, carotid, popliteal, femoral, are accom- panied by a single venous trunk ; and certain veins, such as those of the cranium, spinal canal, liver, and larger veins of bones, run apart from arteries. The communications between veins are more frequent than those ol ai'teries, and they take place between the larger as well as the smaller vessels ; the vena) comites communicate with each other in their course by means of short transvei'se branches which pass across from one to the otlier. The ottice of these inosculations is very apparent, as tending to obviate the obstructions to which veins are DSTKUCTUEE OF VEINS. particularly lial)le from the thinness of their coats, and from their inability to overcome much impediment by the force of their current. Structure of Veins.â€”Veins closely resemble arteries in their structure, and like them are formed of three coatsâ€”external or tunica adventitia, iiiiddle or tunica media, and internal or tunica intima. It will be sufficient if we here indicate the particulars in Avhicli thesu several coats differ from those corresponding to theur in arteries. External Coat.â€”This is thick in proportion to the other coats, aud is composed of longitudinal and oblitpie bands of filjrous tissue, with some elastic fibres ; the interstices between the fibres lodge ramified connective-tissue corpuscles. In certain veins, as the in- ferior vena cava, renal, azygos, spermatic, and external iliac veins, this coat contains a thin layer of unstriped nuiscular tissue. Middle Coat.â€”The transverse muscular fibres which distinguish this coat in both arteries and veins are in the latter very thin ; they never form continuous layers, and are never sejjarated fi'oni each other by distinct elastic membranes as in the arteries, the interven- ing substance in veins being us\ially white fibrous tissue. Inner Coat.â€”This coat is firmer than the inner coat of arteries, and can be stripped off without breaking ; it consists of an endothelial layer, a subendothelial layer of branched cells, and an elastic layei-, either forming fenestrated membrane, or existing simply as a closely areolated longitudinal network of coarse and tine elastic fibres. Longitudinal muscular fibres are found in the inner coat of some veins. Variations in the Structure of Veins.â€”The middle coat is wanting in the thoracic pai't of the inferior vena cava and in the hepatic veins ; it is most developed in the splenic and portal veins, and in those of the gravid uterus. The sui^erior and inferior vena cava and pulmonary veins as they enter the heart receive a covering of striped muscular fibres, continued on to them from tliat organ. Muscular tissue is absent from the veins of the maternal part of the placenta, the jugular and subclavian veins, the veins of the retina, tlu' .sinuses of the dura mater, the veins of bones and muscle, and tlu- spaces in the substance of the corjDora cavernosa of the penis. Tlu' veins of the gravid uterus have muscular tissue in considerabk' quantity, and distributed throughout all three of their coats. The Valves of Veins are composed of a thin stratum of fibrous tissue mingled with fine elastic fibi'es, and coated on the tAvo sui-faccs with the endothelial lining of the A-essel. The segments or fiaps of the valves of veins are semilunar in form, and arranged in jmirs, one. upon each side of the vessel ; in some instances there is but a singK' flap, which has a spiral direction, and occasionally there are threo. The free border of the valvular flaps is concave, and directed forwards, so that while the current of blood is permitted to i\ow freely towards the heart, the valves are distended, and the current intercepted, if the stream Ijeconie retrograde in its course. On the cardiac side of each valve the \ eiu is ex])anded into two pouchesLYMPHATICS. (siiiuse.s), coiTespouding with tlie flaps of the valves, ^v\nc]l giva to the distended or injected vein a knotted appearance. The valves are most numerous in the veins of the extremities, particularly in the deeper veins, and they are generally absent in the very small veins, and in the veins of the viscera, as in the portal and cerebral veins, those of the liver, kidney, and uterus ; tliey are also absent in the lai'ge trunks, as in the vente cavse, venae azygos, innominate, pulmonary, and iliac veins. The trunk and branches of the umbilical vein are devoid of valves, as are also the ovarian veins, and the veins of the can- cellous tissue of l^one. Sinuses are venous channels, excaA'ated in the structure of an organ, and lined by the internal coat of the veins ; of this structure are the sinuses of the diira inatei', whose external covering is the filjrous tissue of the membrane. The external investment of the sinuses of the uterus is the tissue of that organ. Veins, like arteries, are sujjplied Avith nutritious vessels, the rasa vasorum; their nervous filaments, few in number and of small size, are derived from the sympathetic and spinal system ; they have been chiefly found on the largei' A'eins, as, the vena) cava), iliacs, crural, jugular, vertebral, and sinuses of the dura mater.

Lymphatic vessels form a secondary vascular system and sei've two important purposes, namely, to convey into the blood tlie products of intestinal digestion, and to return to the blood materials which having l)een once used do not I'cquire to be excreted, but may, after undergoing change or elaboration in the lymphatic vessels and glands, be again used for the building up of tissues. Tlie A^essels employed tor the first of these purposes are called lacteals, from the milkv lluid tliey convey ; the rest of the vessels are called lymphatics, froiu the fluid contained being clear and transparent (lym2)ha, water). These two kinds of vessels do not differ structurally from each other. The lymphatic system consists of three parts, "^vessels, capillaries, and glands. Lymphatic vessels are of two kinds â€” large vessels, as the thoracic, duct- and its trilnitaries ; and small vessels, such as are iound throughout the body generally. Both kinds possess a great numl)er of valves placed at very short distances from each other, so that when a lymphatic vessel is'inflatcd it ])resents a lieaded appear- ance. The valves are almost identical in structure and arrangement52 STEUCTUKE OF LYMPHATICS. with tliose descvibed in connection with veins, consisting of one or two seniilunar folds formed by tlie lining membrane of the vessel. The large vessels cori'espond in structure to veins, and have three coats of extreme thinness ; the outer formed of delicate filn-ous tissue, the middle of unstiiped muscular fibres, and the inner of elastic tissue supporting a single layer of nucleated endothelial cells, of elongated form and with sinuous edges. The small lymphatics are very numerous, being found in evei y part of the body, in every organ, and probably existing in every tissue. They are much moi'e numerous than the veins, ljut are of microscopic size ; they form, by their commimications, complicated plexuses, the meshes of which are often exceedingly close. Theii' Avails are formed by a single layer of flattened endothelial cells "with siniious edges and nuclei which are not in tlie centre of the cells ; their tubular shape and the existence of valves serve to distinguish them from the lymphatic capillaries. Lymphatic Capillaries.â€”These are often larger than the smallest trunks, but are distinguished from them by the extreme irregularity of their shape and by the absence of valves. They -vary greatly in their ar- rangement in dif- ferent parts, some- times ensheathing H the blood-vessels. at others forming irregular Fig. 64.â€”Lymiihatic capillaries ; showing the great variation in tlieir size and shape. lacunar caAdties, or, yet again, enclosing 'the bundles of fibrous tissue in a tendon, and foi'ni- ing for them a delicate sheath. In whatever form they exist, they may be identified by i)encilling th tissue with a solution of nitrate of silver, when the endothelial cell.- are made evident by the colouration of the intercellular cementing substance. The wall is formed l)y a single layer of cells, Avhicli difter from those lining the smallest lymphatic vessels by being shorter, and having more sinuous outlines. Many lymphatic capillaries open into a system of lacunie, con- nected with each other liy ininute canals (the lymph-canaliciilar system of Recklinghausen), the lacuna) lying in an albuminous ground sul)slance, and lodging ramified cells or connective-tissue corpuscles. The contained cells constitute a sort of lining on oneS3 STRUCTURE OF LYMPHATICS. side of the lacuna, and are coiitinnoiif* with the endothelial cells of the lymphatic capillary with which the lacuna is connected. The lymph-canalicular system is almost the only representative of the lymphatics in the cornea, the grey and white matter of the brain and spinal cord, and in cartilage. In tendon, fascire, mnscle of both kinds, and ner\'es, the lymphatics are found as continuous clefts or longitudinal spaces between the connective-tissue bundles or the propel' fibres of the tissue. In areolar tissue they form the areola) or intersjDaces which we have described on a previous page as characterising that tissiie ; and in the nervous centres they form spaces or sheaths around the blood-vessels, which have been named perivasmlar lynifli spaces. The lymiDhatics of serous membranes are tery numerous, and have a complicated ari-angement which cannot here be fully described ; the most important features are, fii\st, that there are frequent invaginations of the blood-vessels, either by lymphatic tubes or by an intercommxinicating system of lympli sinuses lined with endothelium ; and, second, that the lymphati(; capillaries communicate with the surface of the serous meml)rane by means of openings called stomata, Avhich are bordered by ger- minating ejiithelium differing in character fi'om tlie cells which form the surface of the membrane. The germinating cells when ripe l)ecome detached, and form free lymph cells. It will be thus seen that there are two chief forms in which the lymphatics originate, namely, by sj^aces or sinuses lined by a com- plete endothelium and by irregular lacunae, lined only on one side by a branched connective-tissue cell. Lymphatic Glands (aljsorbent glands) are small, oval ov hean- .shaped, flattened or rounded bodies, of a reddish-bi'own colour, placed at short inter\-als in the course of the small lyjnphatic vessels. They are found in groups in the axilla, popliteal space, groin, lumbar region of the abdomen, round the root of the lungs, and in the neck, and are joined together by means of the lyni]ihatic vessels which enter or leave them. Each gland presents externally the appeai'ance of being com- posed of lobulea, and generally has at one side a slight depression or hilus, through which the blood-vessels enter the interior. The lymphatic vessels connected with the gland consist of a large one apparently issuing from the very centre of the gland, called vas efferens, and numerous smaller ones passing into the interior at different i)arts of the periphery, each of these being called a vas afferem. On sec^tion the extei-nal pai't of the gland is found to be of a different colour and consistence to the intei'ior, and hence the two parts are distinguished as cortical and mednllary. The gland is surrounded by a capsule which is continuous with the outer coat of the afferent and efferent vessels ; it is formed of Avhite fibrous tissue, the fibres crossing each other in different directions, and enclosing connective-tissue corimscles in their meshes. At the hilus the fil)res ot the capsule are continued into the interior of the gland, the fibrous tissue becomes mixed with a small (piantitv of unsti-iped54 STRUCTURE OF -LYMPHATICS. iimscle, iUK.l Mil' l)aii(ls so rtnistilutcd radiate from llic (â– ciiln'Ttd llie peripliery, and )>ecoimi coiiuected witJi the iiitcjrior of the capKuU;; they thus form numerous septa wliich divide the caAdty of the gland into spaces.

In both corte.\ and medulla the gland pulp or substance is .separated fi-om the trabeculue forming alveoli and meshes by a space of neai-ly uniform widtli throughout; this is the lymph sinus or lymijh path. It is not empty, but is occupied by I'etifoi-m connecti\'e tissue, that is to say, ramilied or anastomosing cells ; these support large numbers of lvni]jh corpuscles, which are cari-ied onwards by the current of lymph.

Course of the Lymph. â€”The aft'erent vessels, after branching ujion and in the tissue of the ca]3- â€¢sule, open into the lymph sinus in the cortex of the gland ; the efferent vessels, on the other hand, commence by small liranches connected with the sinus in the medul- lary meshes. The lymph enters the cortical alveoli by the affer-ent ^-essels, traverses the lymph path in the cortex, from thence jDasses into the medulla, and taking its course through the lymph ]iath in that part of the gland, reaches the efferent vessel, and by it leaves tlie gland, the lymph cells which it receives in such large numbers in passing through the gland are derived from the lymphoid tissue tilling up the great part of the Fic. 68.â€”Part of medulla of a lymphatic gland. a.

On entering a gland the lym- phatic vessel loses all its coats except the innei- endothelial one, which is continued over the trabecula), forniing a delicate lining foi these partitions. The lymphatic glands above described are sometimes .spoken ot as coiiifoimd lymphatic glands, to distinguish them from masses oi' lymphoid tissue found in various parts of the body, and described as simple li/viphatic glands. Examples of the latter are the tonsils, glands at the root of the tongue, thymus gland, solitary and agrainalc glands of the intestine, and the Malpighian bodies of the .spleen. These will be described in the section on the vi-scera, in connection with the organs of which the adenoid masses form a ])a]'t. SEROUS MEMBRANES. These occur in the form of a thin transparent web which lines the interior of cavities containing viscera, and is so disposed as to facili- tate movement. The chief examples are the pleurte and pericardium in the chest, peritoneum in the abdomen, arachnoid in the cranium and spinal canal, and the tunica vaginalis in front of the testicle. A serous membrane consists of two parts, one which lines the cavity, called the parietal layer ; the PiQ. 6g. â€”Plan of a other, which is reflected from membrane. ^^^(^%^ the wall of the cavitv, and 1.

The sei'ous membranes are all closed .sacs, retaining their fluid contents when from any cause there is an abnormal effusion. The only exception to this is the peritoneum in the female, where at the extremity of the Falloi)ian tube tlu; serous membrane is continuous with the miicous lining of the tube. In some cases, as the serous membrane of the heart and lungs, its arrangement is very simple ; in others, as the pei-itoneum, it is very complex, owing to the number of organs contained in the cavity : but in all (except the arachnoid) the two layers can easily be madi' out. At the place where the reflection takes place, the vessels of the contained organ enter it. The viscus, although said to be sni'- rounded by the serous membrane, is in reality outside of it. Tlif accompanying plan of such a sac will give an idea of the manner of arrangement. Structure.â€”Serous membranes are lined by a layer of flattenedSYNOVIAL MEMBKANES. 57 t-ndotlielial cells ^vitli sinuous edges and clear oval nuclei, each con- taining one or more nucleoli. Openings exist in many of the serous membranes, M'hich, as stated above, communicate with the lymphatic capillaries ; they are called stomata, are commonly oval in shape, and are bordered by cells which are thicker and of a more granular character than those covering the rest of the surface (see Fig. i6, p. ij). As these cells are actively groAving, and often produce free corpuscles, they have been described by Klein under the name of germinating endothelium. Besides the stoniata, other interruptions in the epithelial layer have been noted. These are called pseudo-stomata ; they are not true openings, liut are p)rocesses of protoplasm sent up to 1 he surface by the con- nective-tissue cells of ilie subserous tissue. Tlie deep layer of serous membranes con- sists of a connective-tis- sue ground substance formed of yelloAV and white fibres, and sup- porting the capillary vessels and lym- phatics ; the ground Fig. 70.â€”Endotbelium from abdominal surface of cen- tral tendon of diaphragm of a rabbit, stained witli nitrate of silver, a.

Smaller cells over a lymphatic capillary, in vyliich several pseudo-stomata may be seen. substance also contains branching connective-tissue cells lying in cell spaces, many of the processes of which pass up between the epi- thelial cells of the surface and form pseudo-stomata. The fluid secreted by serous membranes is almost identical with the fluid part of lymph, and from the fact that the cavities formed by serous inenibranes freely communicate with the lymphatic system througli the medium of the stomata, it is now generally held' that they are indeed lymph spaces or sacs. As witliclrawn from healthy serous cavities the fluid coagulates spontaneously, but Avhen it accumulates under conditions of disease (in dropsy, for instance), it requires for its coagulation the addition of some sul)stance containing globulin. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. These membranes are nearly identical in structure witli the serous membranes, but the secretion is more viscid and something like the white of egg, whence the name. They line the cavities of joints, and are interposed between tendons and bones when much friction or pi'essure is produced during their movenients.58 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. Thro.e classes of synovial nienilji-anes liave to be descriljedâ€”namely, tliose lining the cavities nf joinis, Articular ; tliose forming closed sacs, Bursal ; and lliosc fofiiiing lubricating sheaths for tendons, Vaginal or Ensheathing. 1. Articular Synovial Membranes (Synovial CwpHulesi).â€”These cover the intci'ioi' of tlie ligaiiienis enclosing a diarthi'odial joint, and seci'ete a Huid called synovia, which Inbricates the articular sur- faces and ensures sinootli movement. The membrane is not (as was formerly supposed) cont inued over the -whole surface of the articular cartilage, but simply overlaps its mai-gin to a very slight extent ; at its termination it l)ecomes firudy adherent to the cartilage. Vyiien a tendon passes through a joint, as, for instance, the tendon of the biceps through the shoulder joint, it is invested by this membrane, which is often continued on it for some distance beyond the capsule of the joint. In large joints additional folds of synovial menrbrane, containing fat, pass betAveen the bones, or are lodged in excavations near the articular surfaces; some of these receive the name of ligaments, others are simply described as synovial fringes. 2. Bursal Synovial Membranes (Bursce Mucosce).â€”In these tin- synovial memlirane forms a shut sac, sutticient Huid being seci'eted to lubricate the opposed surfaces, and the outer surface of the sjic being connected with the neighl:)ouring structures. Bursas are found in all ]daces where it is desirable to prevent friction l)etween sur- faces which move on each othei'; thus they are placed between the tendons of muscles, l)etween tendons and the exterior of certain joints, and sometimes between a muscle and a bone. Many bursa* are sidicutaneous, and are then of use to ward oft' external ])ressui'e ; such are the bursse found between the skin and the patella, and l)etween the skin and the olecranon, or those on the styloid processes of the radius and idna. Bursa) lying in contact with the capsule of a joint often Ijecome connected with the cavity of the joint. 3. Vaginal or Ensheathing Synovial Membranes.â€”These form sheaths for the tendons of many m\;scles, more especially those on the ]3almar and dorsal surfaces of the wiist, and the tendons jiassing to the phalanges of the fingers and toes. They not only serve to lubricate those tendons, but are also the means by whicli they are connected with the bones, and with each other ; small bands called "frena" passing from one part of the mend)rane to another. Structure of Synovial Membrane.â€”Synovial membranes arc foruied eutii'ely of connective tissue, the deep layer being composed of ramified corpuscles end)edded in a ground substance. The frei' surface was formerly described as being covered by a single layer of llattened epithelial" cells, Imt further investigation has established the fact that the only cells found on the surface are of the branched and. anastomosing kind, similar to those in the deeper layer of the tissue, and that the surface between the cells is formed by albuminoid ground substance. Here and there, however, the cell's become so aggregated together, as to present some resend.tlance to an59 MUCOUS MEMBEANE. epithelial layer ; but tliis aggregation only takes place in isolated patches, and'not over the whole membrane. The synovial membrane passes a little beyond the edge of the articular cartilage, and its cells becoming changed in form and losing their processes come to bear a close resemblance to cartilage cells ; it thus becomes quite impossil.)le to determine the exact spot at which the membrane ceases.. Blood-vessels are numerous in the deep layer of synovial mem- branes ; the>' extend for only a short distance beyond the edge of the cartilage, where they forin a circle of anastomosis, the loops of which are distinguished by dilatations. MUCOUS MEMBRANE. Mucous membrane is the tissue which lines all the internal pas- sages couimunicating with the surface of the body. It secretes a viscid fluid called mucus, which protects and lubricates its surface, so as to allo^v of the passage of substances which otherwise would injure or irritate it. There are two great tracts of mucous mem- lirane, called the gastro-pidmonary and genito-uriuary. The first communicates with the sui'face of the body at the edge of the eyelids, nostrils, uiouth, and anus ; the second at the orifice of the urethra in the male, of the "\ agina in the feuiale. Every duct which opens into either of these tracts is a tubular prolongation of the mucous mem- brane ; and the A'arious glands which pour their secretions into the alimentary canal on the one hand, and those connected with the bladder and organs of generation on the other, are hut complicated I'amifications of that meuibrane continued to them through their respecti\-e ducts. The structure of mucous membrane is analogous to that of serous uiembrane, but more couaplex. It consists of two po)'tionsâ€” one, the corium, a tough fibro-vascular layer ; the other the epi- thelium, coui]iosed of one or more layers of cells which rest on the coriuui. The coriuui in most situations is separated from the epithelial layer by a thin, transparent membraneâ€”the basement membrane ; it is composed of fiatteued cells joined by tlieir edges, and is often pierced by numerous openings through which the deeper processes of the ei)ithelial cells pass. Underneath this filmy structui'e lies the capillary plexus, and on it i-est the epithelial cell's. The corium consists of a congeries of vesselsâ€”capillaries and lymphaticsâ€”woven into a couipact tissue by interlacing fibres of connective tissue. The ])ink colour of mucous membrane depends on the capillary plexus seen thi'ough the semi-transparent cellular epitlieliuiii. In certain situations plain or involuntary muscular libres occur as a thin but delinite layer on the deep aspect of the conuni, iorming the mvscularis mucosce; this is especially distinctSECRETING GLANDS. 6o in thii mvicoiis iiuiinbmne of the alimentary canal, where the fibres may also be traced l)etweeii the glands, and into the villous pro- jections. Also, in sbme parts, and especially in th(! intestinal canal, it contains abundance of lymphoid tissue. The arrangement of the vessels of the capillaiy plexus differs in each situation, so that a portion of mucous membrane under examination can be recognised l^y its vessels alone â€”as, for instance, the villi of the intestines, the air-cells of tlie lung, &c. The epithelium of mucous meml:)rane may l)e in a single layer or stratified, and the individual cells may be scaly, columnar, or ciliated. A peculiar vai-iety of epithelium is often seen among the ordinary columnar i,jc,. 71. â€” '^^^^^ actively secreting mucous membrane, which Goblet cell has been named "goblet epithelium" or "goblet cells." clTeTofcat '^^^^ mode of its formation from the ordinai'y columnar cells has been already described (see }). 9). Submucous Tissue.â€”The corium is connected to the structures on which it lies by a layer of areolar tissue, which is dense and firm in some situations, where its filn-es are continuous with the inter- lacing fibres of the corium ; but in most it is loose, and permits the corium to glide on the surface on which it lies, so that it may 1 le thrown into folds, or rugcB. The laxity of this submucous tissue renders it liable to be distended with fluid, as a result of inflamma- tion, as in the case of chemosis of the conjunctiA^a and oedema of tlie glottis. The submucous tissue alloAvs of the ada^^tation of the mucous membrane to the altered size of the organ, according as it is distended or contracted ; it lodges the deeper and larger mucous glands, gi\'es space for the sul)division and distribution of the blood-vessels and nerves, and contains lymph spaces and lymphatic plexuses, in free communication with the lymphatic capillaries of the mucous meni- brane. The arrangement of the mucous membrane, and the structure of the glands in connection with it, will be desci-ibed along with the anatomy of the organs of which it constitutes a part. SECRETING GLANDS. The simplest example of secreting structure is to be found in the serous membranes, which have on their surface a layei^ of endothelial cells, performing tlie work of secretion; beneath this, a sul)endothelial layer foi'med of connective-tissue corpuscles embedded in an albu- minous ground substance, while in the ground substance and beneath it there is a fine plexus of capillary vessels, furnishing the blood from which the secretion is separated. However complicated glands may appeal', it is easy to recognise in them the same three essential constituents as in serous membranes, namely, secreting cells, supporting tissue, and capillary vessels, but6i SECRETING GLANDS.

In most of tlie glands the cells are of a spheroidal or irregular cubical form, and the supporting tissue is reduced to a basement mem- brane. Glands may lie divided into six forms, three of them being described as sini2)le, and tlii'ee as compound. The former are the simple follicle, saccvde, and tul )ule; the latter the compound follicle, saccule, and tuljule. The simple follicle is merely a dejjression, resembling in shape the finger of a glove, and lined with cells mostly of the columnar variety, but with some granular spheroidal cells intermixed. The narrow ca^dty between the cells is called the lumen of the gland. The best examples of this foi'm of gland are to l)e found in the small intestines, Avhere they are called Lieberkuhn's follicles. The simple tubule is an elongated follicle, the deeply seated end becoming convoluted like a ball of twine ; the upper ])art of the tulje is lined with squamous, and the lower with cubical epithelium. The sweat glands of the skin are examples of tlie simple tubular gland. Tlic simple saccule is a pouch-like sac, dilated below, and cou- Fic. 73.â€”I. Compouud follicle. 2. Compound tubular gland. 3. Comj)ound saccular or racemose gland. nected with tlie surface above by a narrow neck. The saccule is crowded with cells, chiefly of spheroidal form, so that little or no free cavity or lumen is left. The sebaceous glands connected with the hair follicles of the skin are examples of this form of gland. The compound follicular gland is a follicle, the termination of â– \vhich is cleft into two or three divisions. The gastric follicles near the pyloric end of the stomach have this form. The compound tubular gland consists of branching tubules wliich become convoluted at their deep extremity. This arrange- ment may l)e observed in the tubuli ui-iniferi of the kidnev and seiiiiual tubules of the testicle. Tlie compound saccule is better known under the title of race-SECEETING GLANDS. 62 mose gland. The salivary glands, ]janci-eas, niainiuarv gland, tlic acluymal gland, and Brunner'.s gland.s of the duodenum belong to tins clas.s. The racemose gland presents to the naked eye the appear- ance ot a number of little lobules, held together bv connective tissue, and by the small blood-vessels A\'hich enter or leave them. Each obule IS composed of a number of saccules, called acini, lined bv large protoplasmic cells, with nuclei near their attached mai-giiis. The cells are so large as ahiiost to fill the entire saccule, onlv a small central caA'ity or lumen being left between them. The cells are supported by a framework of connective tissue, which ser\-es also to connect the saccules, and to support a netwoi-k of capillarv vessels which supplies blood to the gland cells. The acini of a lobule open into a common duct, and the ducts from the lobules unite to form I I Fig. 74.â€”Jlocles of termiuation of uerves iu salivary glands, i aud 2.

' The ducts are lined with cylindrical epithelium. The blood-vessels distributed to glands are numerous and of large size. They are remarkable for their rapid inci-easc and diminution in size, according to the activity of the gland, o)' the reverse. The nerves distributed to glands are iiartly derived from the cerebro- spinal and partly from the sympathetic system ; many of the latter are distributed to the blood-vessels, and serve to regulate the supi")ly of blood to the gland.

The plexus is composed cliieily of medullated63 THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. fibres, and the branches given off from it are also niedullated, till ihey penetrate the basement membi^ane of the acini, or the wall of the dncts ; they then lose their medidlary sheath, the axis cylinder splits up into numerous primitive fibrils, which pass into the sub- stance of the epithelial cells of the ducts and tlie gland cells of the alveoli (Pttiiger), often reaching the nuclei of those cells. Ganglion cells are also described as directly connected by their processes with the gland cells of salivary glands. THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. Tlie skin is the exterior investment of the body, which it serves to cover and protect. It is continuous at the apertures of the in- ternal cavities witli the lining meml^rane of those cavities, tlie internal skin or mucous membrane, and is composed essentially of two layers, derma and epidermis. The DERMA, cutis vera or cerium, is the deep layer of the skin ; it is composed of areolar tissue, muscular tissue, and fat, together with numerous blood- vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, which ramify through it. For convenience of description it is divided into a reticular and pa- pillary layer, but it must be re- membered that these are nowhere separable the one from the other. Tlie reticular or deep layer of tlie dei'ma presents some variety in thickness in different parts of the body. Tlius in the more exposed regions, as the back, the outer sides of the limbs, the palms, and the soles, it is remarkable for its thick- ness ; Avhile on protected parts it is comparatively tlun, and on the eye- lids , penis, and scrotum is jjeculiarly delicate. It is connected by its undei' sui'face with the coinmon superficial fascia of the body. It is composed chiefly of white filirous tissue collected into bundles, which are small and closely packed in the xipper strata, large anct coarse in the FiG. 75.â€”Vertical section of skin of linger.

The superlicial strata contain much yellow elastic tissue, the quantity of which varies in different jjarts of tlie Ijody, being much increa.sed in tlie neighliourhood of joints. The deep strata contain unstriped muscular fibi-es, eitlier gathered into bundles or dispersed among the fibrous tissue. In some parts the muscular tissue is so thick as to form a distinct layer, as in the "tunica dartos" of the scrotum, in the nijjple and its areola, the j)enis and the perineum. There- are also distinct bands of muscle connected with the hair follicle.- ; these will be descriljed in speaking of the hairs. Tlii-oughout the whole of the reticular layer connective-tissue cor- puscles ai'e found ; thej^ generally anastomose so as to form a net- work. The papillary or superficial layer of the derma is raised in tlie form of conical prominences or papillcB. On the general surf arc of the body the papillae are short and exceedingly minute ; l)ut in other situations, as the palmar surface of the hands and fingeis, and the plantar surface of tlie feet and toes, they are long and of large size. They also ditt'er in arrangement; for, on the genei'al surface, they are distributed at unequal distances and without order ; whereas, on the palms and soles, and on the corresponding surfaces of the fingers and toes, they are collected into little squai-e chimps, containing from ten to twenty i^apillse, and these little clum2)s are disposed in parallel rows. It is this arrangement in rows that gives rise to the chai'acteiistic parallel ridges and furro^\â– s which are met with on the hands and feet. The papillfe in these little square clumps are for the most part uniform in size and length, hwi every here and there one papilla may be obserA-ed Avhich is longer than the rest. The largest papillae of the derma are those which produce the nail. In structure the papilla is com- ]josed of homogeneous, nucleated, and fibrillated areolar tissue, with a few transverse elastic fibi'es. The papillae are separated from the ejiidermis by an apparently homogeneous basement membrane which becomes evident as a transparent line, when the tissue is treated with a solution of chloride of gold. The papillaj are divi- sible into vascular and nervous, the former pi'edominating; some of the nervous papillae are occupied by a peculiai' form of nerve ter- mination called the tactile corpuscle of Meissner or Wagner. The EPIDERMIS or cuticle (scari'skin) covei's the superficial surface of the derma, which it serves to envelop and defend. That surface of the epidermis which is exposed to the influence of the atmosphere and exterior sources of injury, is hard and horny in texture, and consists of many layers of horny cell-]ilates, which are not aftected by acetic acid, and in which no nucleus can l)e made out; they form the stratum corneum. Beneath these cells is a layer in which the outlines of the cells become indistinct, so that they appear to form a homogeneous/ stratum, wherein nuclei are seen at intei'vals ; this is called the stratum lucidum. In the succeeding layers the cells have a granular appearance, and contain a peculiar matter named eleidhi; they arcTHE SKIN. 65 oval 01' Hattened, and the granular matter contained in tlieni is re- inarkal)le for the readiness witli which it absorbs colouring matter, such as carmine or hteniatoxyliii. This layer has received the name of slratum cjranulosum. The deepest layer of the epiclermis is known as the rete mucosum or Malpighian layer; it is divisil)le into a deep and a superficial stratum. The deep stratum is in contact with the liasement membrane covering the papilla?, and consists of a layer of Fin. 76.â€”Section of epidermis. H.

(Schci/cr after Jlanviei:) columnar cells ; it is believed that they are the active agents in the selection of nourishment from the corium for the epidermis, and in the ])roduction of the new cells of the rete mucosum. By drawing nourishment from the corium they increase rapidly in size, more especially in length ; the upper part then becomes separated from the rest to form a new cell, while the lower part, remaining still attached to the 1)asement membrane, again elongates by the imbition of new material; again it divides, and so ad ivfinitum. The cells thus EJ66 THE ttKlN. 4Â® formed become larger hy drawing nourislimeiit fiom llie coriiim, and it is probable tliat they also divide to t'orin other cells. As this pro- cess goes on, the newest-formed cells pnsh the older ones away irom the corinm, and as the latter ascend towards the surface of tlie skin they nndergo certain changes. In consecpience of the pi-essui-e which they sustain they become flattened ; as they get beyond the ivange of nutrition they become altered in consistence, and finally they become subject to evaporation. Thus it happens that the ceil which is at first spherical becomes elliptical, then becomes still more flattened, and at length desiccates into a thin membi'anous scale, in which no nucleus is apparent; in this last form it is thrown off'. The superficial cells of the rete mucosum are marked on their surface by irregular ridges and furrows, and sometimes by small spines ; the ridges do not fit into the furrows, but the result of their presence is that minute channels are left between the cells which probably serve for tlie passage of nutrient fluid. Wa;nder-cells are often observed among the cells of the rete miicosum. The under surface of the epidermis is accurately modelled on the papillary layer of the derma, each papilla having its appropriate sheath in the newly- formed rete mucosum, and each ir- regularity of surface of the former ha\dng its re^jresentative in the soft tissue of the latter. On the external surface, this character is lost; the minute elevations corresponding with the pa- pillcE are, as it were, polished down, and the surface is' rendered smooth and uniform. The palmar and plantar sur- face of the hands and feet are, however, an exception to this rule ; for here, in consequence of the large size of the papillae and their peculiar arrangement in rows, ridges correspond- ing with the papillse are strongly marked on the sujjerficial surface of the epidermis. The epidermis is remarkaljle for its thickness in situations where the papillae are large, as in the palms and soles. In other situations, it assumes a character Avliich is also due to the nature of the surface of the derma ; namely, that of being marked Ijy a network of linear furrows wliich trace out the surface into small polygonal and diamond-shaped areas. These lines cori-espond with the folds of the derma produced by its movements, and are most numerous where those movements are greatest, as in the flexures and on the convexities of joints. The dark colour of the skin among the natives of the South is due to the presence of pigment granules in the deep cells of the rete Fig. 77.â€”Diagram illustrative of the development ot the epider- mis and of epithelia in general. 1.

As the cells desiccate, the colour of the granules is lost, so that the cells of the superficial layers are very little darker iii the skin of the negro than in that of the Avhite man. The pores of the epidermis are the openings of the sweat ducts, liair follicles, and sebaceous glands. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the derma, which enter its structure through the areola) of the under surface of the corium, divide into innumerable intermediate vessels, which form a- rich capillary plexus in the superficial strata of the skin and in its papil- lary layer. In the papillce of some parts of the derma, as in the longitudinal plications beneath the nail, the capillary vessels form simple loops, but in other papillae they are convoluted to a greater or less degree in proportion to the size and importance of the jjapilla). CaiDillary jDlexuses are also found around the groups of fat vesicles, the sweat glands, and hair follicles. The lymphatic vessels form, in the suj^erficial strata of the derma, a plexus, the meshes of which are interwoven with those of the capillary and nervous plexus. In some parts of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, lymphatics pass into the papillae, but do not reach their siuumit. The nerves of the derma, after entering the areolae of the deeper part of the corium, divide into minute fasciculi, which form a ter- FiG. 78.â€”Three groups of tactile papillae from the skin of the index finger, in vertical section. Some are supplied with vascular loops, some with tactile cor- puscles. minal plexus in the upper strata of the corium. From this plexus the primitive filn-es j)ass off to their distribution as loops, in the papillaj. In the less sensitive parts of the skin the loops are simple and more or less acute in their bend, in conformity with the figure of the papillae. In the sensitive parts, and especially in the tactile papillae of the pulps of the fingers, the nerves terminate in special sense organs, namely, end bulbs. Pacinian bodies, and tactile cor- puscles ; the two former have already been described (p. 39). Small ^Wlcose nerve fil)rils pass into the epidermis, and penetrate between tne cells of Malpighian layer, to terminate in minute bulbous ends, without anastomosing.

APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. The appendages of the skin are the nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands and ducts. The NAILS are horny appendages of the skin, identical in forma- tion with the epidermis, of which they are a part. A nail is convex on its external surface, concave within, and im})lanted by means of a thin margin or root in a fold of the derma, which is "nearly two lines in depth, and acts the part of a follicle to the nail. At the bottom of the groove of the follicle are a number of filiform papillte, which produce the margin of the root, and, by a successive foj'ma- tion of new cells, push the nail onwards in its growth. The concave surface of the nail is in contact with the derma, and the latter forms the matrix of tlie nail, and is covered by papillse, which perform the double office of retaining the nail in its place, and gi^^ng it in- creased thickness b}^ the aduition of newly-formed cells to its under surface. It is this constant change occurring in the under surface of the nail, co-operating M'ith the continual formation taking place along the margin of the root, which ensures the gi'owth of the nail in the proj)er direction. The nail derives a peculiarity of ajjpear- ance from the disposition and form of the papillae of the matrix. Thus, beneath the root, and for a short distance ouAvards towai-ds its middle, the derma is covered l)y papillae which are more minute, and consequently less vascular than the j)apillae somewhat farther on. This patch of papillaj is bounded by a semilunar line, and that part of the nail covering it being lighter in colour than the rest, has been termed lunula. Beyond the lunula the papillae are raised into longitudinal pleats, which are exceedingly vascular, and give a deeper tint of redness to the nail. These pleat-like papillaj of the derma are well calculated by their form to offer an extensive surface both for the adhesion and formation of the nail. It is the deposit of horny laminas on the surface of these folds that gives rise to the ribbed appearance of the nail. The papillary suInstance of the derma which produces the nail is continuous around the circumference of the attached part of that organ with the derma of tlie surrounding skin, and the horny structure of the nail is consequently continuous with that of the epidermis. HAIRS are hoi ny ajipendages of the sldn, produced by the invo- lution and subsequent evolution of the epidermis ; the involution constituting the follicle in which the hair is enclosed, and the evolu- tion the shaft of the hair. Hairs vary much in size and length in dif- ferent parts of the body ; in some they are so short as not to a]ipear beyond the follicle ; in others they grow to a gi-eat length, as on theAPPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. 69 scalp ; wliile along tlie margins of the eyelids, and in the whiskers and beard, they are remarkable for their thickness. Hairs are generally more or less flattened in form, and on transverse section present an elliptical or reniform outline. This examination also demon- strates that the centre of the liair is porons and loose in texture, Avhile its periphery is dense ; thus affording ground for its division into a cortical and a medullary portion. The free extremity of a hair is gene- rally pointed, and sometimes split into two or three ttla- ments. Its attached extremity is implanted deeply in the in- tegument, extending through Fig. 79.â€”The haii-s and their connections. I. Hair bulb. 2. Inner sheath of tlie fol- licle. 3. Sebaceous gland. 4.

The hair is contained in a de- pre.ssion passing deeply into the reticular layer of the corium, and70 APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. called the hair follicle. It is wide in its deepest part where it contains the Ijulb, gets narrower at the entrance of the ducts of the sel)aceous glands, and again widens as it nears the surface. Its wall consists of two distinct layers, called respectively the external iind internal sheath of the follicle, the former being continuous with the corium, and the latter with the epidei-inis. The external or dermic sheath is formed in its outer layers of longitudinal bundles of connective tissue, in Avhich corpuscles are found, but no elastic fibres ; internally it is distinguishalde as a transparent homogeneous meml)rane, which corresponds to the basement membrane support- ing epithelium in otlier tissues. The internal or ejndermic sheatli adheres closely to the root of the hair, and generally comes away with the latter when it is pulled out; hence it is called the root- sheath. It is also described as composed of an outer and an inner layer. The outer root-sheath corresponds to the rete mucosuni of tlie epidermis, and is com^DOsed of soft polygonal nucleated cells, which in the coloured races are generally pigmented ; these cells become continuous at the bottom of the follicle with those forming the hair bull). The inner root-sheath is again divisible into an inner layer (Huxle//s sheath), formed of flattened, polygonal nucleated cells, two or three deep ; and an outer layer (Henle's sheath) of oblong, flattened cells, without nuclei. On the inner surface of the inner root-sheath is a thin stratum of imbricated scales, closely applied to the surface of the hair, and forming the cuticle of the root-sheath. Connected Avith the hair follicles there are some fine bands of un- striped muscular fibre. These arise from the superficial part of the corium, and are inserted into the out- side of the lower part of the folhcle, below the sebaceous gland. They are placed on the side towards which the hair slopes, and by their contraction erect the hair; hence they have re- ceived the name of erectores pili. The colour of the hair is due to pigment dejiosited in the central cells. The SEBACEOUS GLANDS are em- bedded in the substance of the derma, and present every degree of com- plexity, from the simplest follicle to the com])ound loljulated gland. In some situations their excretory ducts open independently on tlie surface of the epidermis ; but for the most part they terminate in the follicles of the hairs.

They are small round or oblong Ijodies, com- posed of one or more convoluted tubuli, Avliich open into a common efferent duct. The latter ascends from the gland through the derma and epider- mis, and terminates on the surface by a funnel-shaped and oblique aperture or pore. Each gland mass is surrounded by a fine plexus of capillary vessels. The efferent duct presents some variety in its course upwards; within the derma it is straight, or curved and serpentine, and if the epidermis be thin, proceeds more or less directly to the excreting pore. Some- â–  times it is spirally cui'ved within the derma, and having passed the latter, is regularly and Ijeautifully spiral in its passage through the epidermis, the last forming an oblique and valvular opening on the surface. The spiral course of the duct is especially remarkable in the thick epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. On those parts of the skin where the papillae are irregularly dis- tributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriferous glands open on the surface also in-egularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the jjores are situated at regular distances along the ridges, at points corresponding with the intervals of the small.

The ceru'ininous glands of the external auditoi'y meatus are regarded as modified sweat glands, but their secretion in some respects re- sembles that of the sebaceous glands.73 PART 11. OSTEOLOGY. The skeleton is the bony framework wliicli forms tlie support of the bod}^, and affords points of attacliment for the muscles by which the movements are effected. The fundamental part of the skeleton is the spine or vertebral coliimn (from verto^ I turn), because it is the axis around which all the other parts are disposed and on which they move. It exists in all animals possessing an internal skeleton, which are therefore called vertebrate animals. The entire osseous framework of the body constitutes the skeleton, which in the adult man is composed of two hundred distinct bones. They may l)e thus ai'ranged :â€” 'Craniuni.

GENERAL CHARACTERS OF BONES. _ Bones are divisible into four classes:â€”Long, flat, short, and irregular. Tlu- long boiR's are found princiiially in the limhs, and consist of a shatt and two extremities. Tlie shaft is cylindrical or prismoid m torin, dense and hard in texture, and hollowed in the interior into a medullary ('anal. The extremities are broad and expanded to aiticulate with adjoining l)ones ; and are cancellous in internal74 VERTEBRAL COLUMN, strnctiive. Upon the extei'iov of tlie bones care processes and rougli surfaces for tlie attacliuient of muscles, and foramina for tlie ti-aiis- mission of vessels and nerves. The character of long Ijones is, there- fore, theii- general type of striu-ture and their divisibility inU) a central portion and extremities, and not so much theii- length ; foi- there are certain long bones, as the second phalanges of the toes, which are less than a quartei' of an inch in length, and which, in some instances, exceed in breadth their longitudinal axis. The long bones are, the clavicle, humerus, radius and ulna, femur, tibia and fibula, metacarpal bones, metatarsal, phalanges, and ribs. Flat bones are com2)Osed of two layers of dense bone with inter- mediate loose structure. They are adapted to enclose cavities ; have processes upon their surface for the attachment of muscles ; and are perforated l)y foramina for the passage of nutrient vessels to the cavities in their interior, and for the transmission of vessels and nerves. They articulate with long bones by means of smooth sur- faces plated with cartilage, and with each other, either l)y fib]-o- cartilaginons tissue, as at the symphysis pubis ; or by suture, as in the bones of the skull. The two condensed layers of the bones of the skull are named, tables ; and the intermediate open structure, diploe. The flat bones are, the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, sternum, scapulte, and innominate bones. Short bones ha^^^e an exterior shell of dense bone filled vrith spongy or cancellous suljstance ; of this sort are the bones of the carpus and tarsus, and the seasamoid bones, including the patella. The irregular bones include all that remain after the long, short, ^nd flat bones have been excluded. They are essentially irregular in their form, in some parts flat, in others short and thick ; and are constructed on the same general principle as other bones. The bones of this class are, the temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, inferior maxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, hyoid, ver- tebrae, sacrum, and coccyx. The skeleton is divisilile into : I. The vertebral column, or central axis. 2. The head and face, or superior development of the central axis. 3. The hyoid arch. 4. The shoulder girdle and ujiper ex- tremities. 5. The pelvic girdle and lower extremities. VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The vertebral column is the central axis which supports the head, thorax, and upper extremities. It consists of numerous sepa- rate bones called vertebroi, which, although possessing a limited degree of motion on each other, yet give to the whole column considerable flexibility. The vertebrae admit of a division into true and false. The true vertebrce are twenty-foui- in number, and are classed, according to the three regions of the trunk which they occu])y, into cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. The false or fixed vertebras consist of nine75 CERVICAL VERTEBRA. pieces united into two bones, the sacrum and coccyx. Tlie arrange- ment of the vertebrae may be better comprehended by means of the accompanjdng table :â€” True vertebrce ( ^ Cervical, -p^^g^ vertebrte ( 5 Sacrum, ^4 - 9 14 Coccyx. Characters of a Vertebra.â€”A vertebra consists of a body or centrum, two lamina3, a spinous process, two transverse processes, and four articular processes. The body or centrum is the solid part of the vertebra ; and, by its articulation with adjoining vertebrae, gives strength and support to the trunk. It is flattened above and below, convex in front, and slightly concave behind. Its anterior surface is constricted around the middle, and j)ierced by numerous small openings, which give passage to nutrient vessels. On its posterior surface is a single irregular opening, or several, for the exit of the venee basis vertebrae. The lamince commence upon the sides of the posterior part of the body of the vertebrae by two pedicles; they then expand, and, arching backwards, enclose a foramen {neural canal), which serves for the jDrotection of the spinal cord. The upper and lower borders of the laminae are rough for the attachment of the ligamenta subflava. The concavities above and l^elow the pedicles are the intervertebral notches. The spinous process stands backwards from the angle of union of the laminae. It is the succession of these projecting processes along the middle line of the back, that has given rise to the common designa- tion of the vertebral column, the spine. The use of the spinous pro- cess is for the attachment of muscles. The transverse processes project one at each side from the laminae of the vertebra; they also are intended for the attachment of muscles. The articular processes, four in number, stand upwards and downwards from the laminae, to articulate with the vertebra above and below. Cervical Vertebrae.â€”In a cervical vertebra the body is smaller than in tlie other regions ; it is broad from side to side, con- cave on the upper surface and convex below, so that, when articu- lated, the vertebrae lock the one into the other. The lateral borders of the upper surface are produced into prominent ridges, and the anterior edge of the lower surface overlaps that of the vertebra Ijelow. The lamince are narrow and long, and the included spinal foramen large and triangular. The superior intervertebral notches are slightly deeper than the inferior; the inferior being the broadest. The spinous process is short and bifid at the extremity, increasing in length from the fourth to the seventh. The transverse processes are also short and bifid, and deeply grooved along the upper surface for tlie cervical nerves. Piercing the base of the transverse process is tlie vertebral foramen, which gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, aiid vertebral plexus of nerves. The artery connnonly passes only through the vertel)ral foramina ofCERVICAL vertebra:. 76 tlie six upper A ('i lel)ra! ; tlie vein more frequently passes tlirongh the foramina of all seven. The transveise processes in this I'egion ai-e formed by two small developments, which proceed, the one from the side of the l)ody, the other from the pedicle, and unite near tlieir extremities to enclose the circular area of tlie verteljral foramen. The anterior of these processes is the rudiment of a cervical rib ; the jiosterior, the homologue of the transverse processes in the dorsal region. The extremities of these developments are the anterior and Fig. 83.â€”A middle cervical vertebr.-i, kc-iu upon its upper surface, x.

There are three peculiar vertebrae in the cerAdcal region:â€”Tlu' first, or atlas ; the second, or axis ; and the se"s^enth, or vertebr;; prominens. The Atlas (named from supporting the head) is a simple ring of Fio. 84.â€”The upper surface of the atlas. I. Tlie anterior tubercle pro] ecting from the anterior arch. 2.

The anterior arch is the shortest; it has a tubercle on its anterior surface, for the attachment of the longus colli muscle ; and on its i)Osterior aspect a smooth surface, for articulation with the odontoid process of the axis. The posterior arch is longer and more slender than the anterior, and flattened from above downwards ; at its middle is a rudimentary * The anterior tubercle of the sixth cervical vertebra is more prominent than the rest; it has been named the carotid tubercle, from its close relation to the common carotid artery, and Cha.fsaignac's tubercle, from the autlior who first pointed out this relation. ICERVICAL VEETEBR^. 77 spinous process, whicli gi^TS origin to the rectus capitis posticus minor muscle ; and upon its upper surface, near the articular pro- cesses, a shallow gi-oove at each side (sometimes converted into a foramen), which represents a superior intervertebral notch, and suppoi'ts the vertebral artery (just before it perforates the diira mater) and the first cervical nerve. The intervertebral notches are peciiliar, from being situated behind the articular processes, instead of before them as in the other vertebrte. The transverse lyrocesses are not bifid ; they are remarkably large and long, and give attach- ment to the oblique muscles which rotate the head ; they are joierced l)y the foramina for the vertebral arteries. The articular processes are situated on the most bulky and strongest part of the atlas. The siqjerior are oval and concave, and look inwards, so as to form a kind of ciip for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are ada])ted to the nodding mo"\^ements of the head ; the inferior are circular, and nearly horizontal, to permit of the rotatory movements. Upon the inner face of the lateral mass which supports the articulai' pro- cesses, is a small tubercle at each side, to which the extremities of the transverse ligament are attached, a ligament which divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal segments : the smaller and ante- rior, for receiving the odontoid process of the axis ; the larger and posterior, to give passage to the spinal cord and its membranes. The Axis (vertebra dentata) is so named from having a pi'ocess shaped like a tooth, forming a pivot upon which the head turns. The Fig. 85.â€”A lateral view of the axis. i.

The transversa 2)rocesses are rndinientaiy, not bifid, and ])roject only so far as to enclose the verteljral foramen, which is directed ol)]i(|uely outwards instead of perpendicularly as in the other vertebrae. The superior articulating processes are situated on the body of tlie vertebi'a, at each side of the odontoid process. They are cii-cular and nearl\- horizontal, having a slight inclination outwards. The inferior articu- lating processes look downwards and forwards, as do the same jii o- cesses in the other cer^dcal A'ertebr-a3. Tlie superior interverttbrul notch is remarkably shallow, and lies behind the articular process as in the atlas ; the inferior notch lies in front of the articular process, as in the rest of the vertebra?. The lower surface of the Ijody is convex, and is received into the concavity iipon the upper surface of the third vertebi'a. The Vertebra prominens, or seventh cervical, approaches in char- acter the upper dorsal vertebrae. It has received its designation from having a very long spinous process, which is single and termi- nated by a tubercle, and forms a projection- on the back part of the neck ; to the extremity of this process the ligamentum nuchae is attached. The transverse processes are but slightly grooved along the upper surface, have each a small foramen for the transmission of the vertebral vein, and present only a rudimentary bifurcation at tlieir extremity. Sometimes the anterior tubercle represents a small but distinct rilo.

The pedicles are strong, and the lamiiice broad and thick : the spinal foramen small and round, and the inferior intervertebral notch of large size ; the superior can scarcely be said to exist.

The articular facets are ])laced jiartly on tlie thick and strong laniinee, and partly on the bodies.

Projecting backA\-ards and up wards from the superior articular process is a convex OA^al tubercl called the raammillary process (metapophysis), and in a well-mark vertebra there is at the base of this a smaller tubercle called th accessory process (anapophysis). The fifth lumbar vertebra differs from the rest in having th body very much bevelled posteriorly, so as to be thick in front an thin behind ; the transverse processes are thick and large, the lows articular processes are wider apart tlian the tipper, and the laniin project into the spinal foramen on each side. General Considerations.â€”Viewed as a whole, the vertebr column represents two pyramids applied base to base, the superio being formed by all the vertebrae from the second cervical to the las lumbar, the inferior by the sacrum and coccyx. Examined mo attentively, it will be seen to be composed of four irremilar pvramid applied to each other by their smaller extremities and by their basVERTEBEAL COLUMN. 8r The smaller extremity of the uppermost pyramid is formed by the axis, or second cervical vertebra; and its base, by the first dorsal. Tlie second pyramid is inverted ; having its base at the first dorsal, and the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually enlarges to the fifth lumbar. The fourth pyramid is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. The bodies of the vertebrse are broad in the cervical region ; narroAved almost to an angle in the middle of the dorsal,' and again iDroad in the lumbar region. The arches are broad and imbricated in the cer\'ical and dorsal regions, the inferior border of each overlapping the superior of the next; in the lumbar region an interval is left between them. A considerable interval exists between the cranium and atlas, and another between the last lumbar vertebra and sacrum. The spinous processes are horizontal in the cervical, and become gradually oblique in the upper part of the dorsal region. In the middle of the dorsal region they are nearly vertical, and imbricated ; towards its lower part they assume the direction of the lumbar spines, wliich are quite horizontal. The transverse processes, although very prominent in the atlas, become almost rudimentary in the axis ; they then gradually in- crease in length to the first dorsal vertebra. In the dorsal region they project obliquely backwards, and diminish suddenly in length in the eleventh and twelfth vertebrae, where they are very small. In the lumbar region they suddenly increase in size, the last lumbar being especially large and strong. The intervertebral foramina formed by the juxtaj^osition of the intervertebral notches are smallest in the cervical region, and gra- dually increase to the last lumbar. On each side of the spinous processes, and extending the whole length of the column, is the vertebral groove, which is shallow and broad in the cervical, and deeper and narrower in the dorsal and luml)ar regions. It lodges the principal muscles of the back. Curves of the Vertebral Column.â€”Viewed from the side, the vertel^ral column presents several curves, the principal of which is situated in the dorsal region, the concavity looking forwards. In the cervical and lumbar regions the column is convex in front; and in the pelvis an anterior concave curve is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. The dorsal curve is due to the bodies of the vertebrse in that region being thicker behind than in front; the cervical curve depends on the greater thickness of the intervertebral substance in front, and the luml)ar curve results in the lower part from the thick- ness of tlie body of the last vertebra anteriorly, and in the upper part from the intervertebral substance being thicker in front. Besides the antero-posterior curves, a slight lateral curve sometimes exists in the dorsal region, having its convexity towards the right side. It is probably caused by habitual faulty posture in working at trades, associated with the use of the right'hand. Development.â€”The vertebrte are developed by three primary and FFir; 8g.â€”Posterior and lateral view of spiiuil column.83 VEETEBRAL COLUMN. five secondary centres or epiphyses. Tlie primary centres are, one for ecacli lamina, and one for the body ; the epiphyses, one for the apex of the spinons process, one for that of each transverse process, one for the upper and one for the under surface of the body. Excep- .tions to this mode of development are met with in the atlas, axis, â€¢'vertebra prominens, and lumbar vertebrae. The atlas has three centres ; one for each lateral mass, and one (sometimes two) for the anterior arch. The axis has six ; one (sometimes two) for the body ; two placed side by side in the base of the odontoid process, and a third at its tip ; lastly, one for each lamina. The vertebra prominens has two additional centres for the anterior or costal segments of the transverse processes, and the lumbar vert eh ne, two for the niammillary processes. The primary centres of the vertebrae make their appearance during the seventh or eighth week of embryonic existence, the laminee being ; somewhat in advance of the body. From the laminae are produced the spinous, transverse, and articular processes, and the sides of the body ; they unite, to complete the arch, one year after l)irth, and with the l)ody during the fifth year. The epiphyses for the extremi- ties of the spinous and transverse processes make their appearance at fifteen or sixteen, and become united to- the rest of the bone between twenty and twenty-five. The epiphyses of the body are somewhat later in appearance, and are consolidated between the peiiods of twenty-five and thirty years of age. The ossific centres for the lateral masses of the atlas a])pear at the same time as those of the other vertebrae ; they unite posteriorly at the end of the second year. The one or two centres of the anterior arch appear during the first year, and become consolidated with the lateral pieces during the fifth or sixth year. The axis develops its lateral j^ieces at the same time as the other vertebrae ; they join posteriorly soon after birth, and with the body during the fourth or fifth year. The centres for the body and odontoid process appear during the sixth month, and are consolidated during the third year. The body of the axis is more largely developed at birth than that of the other vertebrae. The costal segments of the vertebra prominens appear during the sixth month, and become united to the body at the fifth or sixth year ; they sometimes remain permanently separate, and constitute cervical ribs. The lumbar vertebrae have separate centi-es for the mammillary processes, but the transverse process of the first lumljar is sometimes developed altogether from a separate centre, and may I'emain permanently separate, in that case forming a lumbar rib. The ossification of the arches of the vertebrae commences from above, and proceeds gradually downwards ; hence arrest of develop- ment gives rise to spina bifida, generally in the loins. Ossification of tlie Ijodies, on the contrary, commences near the centre, and ]n-o- ceeds towards the extremities of the column ; hence imjierfection of the bodies occurs either in the upper or lower vertebrae. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the atlas are attached nine pairs84 SACRUM. of muscles, tlie longus colli, rectus anticus minor, rectus lateralis, rectus posticus minor, obli([uus superior and inferior, splenius colli, levator anguli scajiuUe, and lirst intertransverse. To the axis are attached eleven pairsâ€”Adz., longus colli, inter- transverse, obliquus inferior, rectus posticus major, interspinal, semi- s])inalis colli, multifidus spina), levator anguli scapula?, splenius colli, transversalis cervicis, and scalenus medius. To the remaining vertehrce collectively, thirty-one pairs and one single muscleâ€”viz., posteriorly, trapezius, latissinrus dorsi, leA^ator anguli scapulaj, rhomboideus minor and major, serratus posticus superior and inferior, sijlenius, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, transversalis cervicis, trachelo- mastoid, complexus, semispinalis dorsi and colli, multifidus spinse, interspinal, intertransverse, levatores costarum : anteriorly, rectus anticus major, longus colli, scalenus anticus, medius, and posticus, psoas magnus, psoas parvus, quadratus limiborum, diaphragm, obliquus internus and transversalis.

The anterior surface is concave, and marked by four transverse lines, Avhich indicate its original constitution of five separate pieces. At the extremities of these lines, on each side, are the four anterior sacral foramina, which diminish in size from above downwards, and transmit the anterior sacral nerves. The ridges between the anterior sacral foramina give attachment to the pyriformis muscle. The ]projection of the superior piece is the sacro-vertebral angle or j;Â»-o- montorij. â– , ^ â–  1 The posterior surface is narrower than tlie anterior, and convex. On a middle line is a rough crest, formed by the rudiments of four spinous processes, the fifth remaining undeveloiied, and exposing the lower termination of the sacral canal. Immediately external to and85 SACRUM. parallel with the median crest, is a range of five small tubercles which rejjresent the articular processes of the true vertebrte ; beyond these is a shallow groove in which the four posterior sacral foramina open, and farther outwards, a range of five tubercles corresponding â– with the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The lowest pair of articular tubercles bound on each side the termination of the sacral canal, and send each a j^rocess downwards to articulate with the coccyx. The two descending j)rocesses are the sacral carnua. The posterior sacral foramina are smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior sacral nerves. Of the posterior transvei'se tubercles the Jirst corresponds with the angle of the suiDerior border of the bone ; the second is small, and enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac articulation ; the third is large, and gives attachment to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament; the foiirth and fifth are smaller, and serve for the attachment of the sacro-iscliiatic ligaments.

The sacrum presents some \'ariety in respect of curvature, and of the numT)er of pieces which enter into its structure. The curve is often very sliglit, and situated only near the hjwer pai-t of the Ijone ; while in other subjects it is considerable, and occurs at the middle of the sacrum. It is sometimes composed of six pieces, moi-e rarely (jf four, and, occasionally, the first and second pieces remain perma- nently separate. The female sacrum is wider and shorter than the male, its ciu'vature is less, and is almost confined to the lower pai-t of the bone ; it also forms a greater angle with the rest of the A'erte- bral colvimn. Development.â€”By thirty-jive points of ossification ; five for each of the first three piecesâ€”viz., one for the body, one for each lateral portion, and one for each lamina; and three for each of the last twoâ€”namely, one for the T)ody and one for each lateral portion. In the progress of growth, and after puberty, fourteen epiphyseal centres are addedâ€”namely, two for the surfaces of each body, one for eacli auricular siirface, and one for the thin edge of each lateral border. Ossification begins in the bodies of the sacral pieces .Somewhat later than in those of the true vertebrae ; the first three appearing during the eighth and ninth week, and the last two at about the middle of intra-uterine existence. Ossification of the laminae takes place during the interval between the sixth and ninth month. The epiphyses for the upper and inider surface of the bodies are developecV during the interval between the fifteenth and eighteenth year ; and for the auricular and marginal piece, after twenty. The two lower vertebral pieces, although the last to appear, are the first to be com^jleted (between the fourth and fifth year), and unite by their bodies. The luiion of the bodies takes place from below upwards, and finishes between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth year with the first two pieces.

The remaining three pieces diminish in size from above downwards. The borders of the bone are narrow, and give attachment to the coccygeus muscle ; the inferior extremity is rounded, and has at- tached to it the fibres of the external sphincter ani. Development.â€”By four centres, one for each piece, but, occa- sionally, one of the upper three pieces has an additional centre. Ossification commences in the first j)iece soon after birth ; in the second, between five and ten years ; in the third, between ten and fifteen ; and in the fourth, between fifteen and twenty. The pieces unite at an earlier jDeriod than the bodies of the sacrum, the first two pieces first, then the third and fourth, and lastly the second and third. Between forty and sixty years, the coccyx becomes consoli- dated Avith the sacrum ; this event taking place later in the female than in the male. . Articulations.â€”With the sacrum.

The Cranium is composed of eight separate bonesâ€”viz., the Occipital, Two temporal. Two parietal. Sphenoid, Frontal, Ethmoid. OCCIPITAL BONE. This bone is situated at the posterior part and base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisil)le into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. External Surface.â€”Is convex from above downwards and from side to side. Crossing the middle of the bone transversely, from one lateral angle to the other, is a prominent ridge, which, as shown in the diagram, commonly consists of an upper and lower line wdth a smooth surface betAveen them. The upper is called the hiqhest curved line, and the loAver the mjierior cicrved line. In the middle of the latter is a projection called the external occipital prottcberance, for the attachment of the li(jament%im nuchas; and descending from it a small vertical ridge, the external occipital crest. Above and below tlie superior curved line the surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles. About three-quarters of an inch beloAV the superior curvedOCCIPITAL BONE. 88 line is another transverse ridge, tlie ivferior curved line, and beneath the hitter the foramen magnum. On eacli side of tlie foj-anien magnum, nearer its anterior than its posterior segment, and encroaching some- what upon the opening, is an ol)long ai-ticuhir sui'face, the condyle, for ai'ticulation with the atlas. Tlie condyles appi-oach towards eacli other ante)'iorly, their articular sui-faces looking downwards and outwards. Directly Ijehind each condyle is an ii-regular fossa, and, sometimes, a small opening, the posterior condylar foramen, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In'front of tlie condyle is the anterior condylar foramen, transmitting the hypoglossal nerve ; on the outer side of each condyle, a projecting ridge, the transverse or jayular process, excavated in front hy a'notcli {jucjtdar notch) which forms part of the jugular foramen ; and directly l)ehind the ridge, and forming its posterior boundary, a prominent process, the jugular tubercle. In front of the foramen magnum is a thick scpiare mass, Fig. 93.â€”External surface of the oc- cipital bone. I. Superior curved line. 2. Exteinal occipital pro- tuberance. 3.

Internal Surface.â€”The internal surface is concave from side to side and from above downwards ; it is'divided by a crucial ridge into four fossEe, the two superior or cerebral fosste lodging the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, the two inferior or cerebellar, the lateral lobes of the cerebellum. The superior arm of the crucial ridge is grooved for the superior longitudinal sinus, and gives attachment to the falx cer ebri; the inferior arm is sharp and prominent for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and slightly grooved for the two occipital sinuses. The transverse ridge gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and is deeply grooved for the lateral sinuses At the point of meeting of the four arms is a projection, the mtcrnal occipital protuberance. The convergence of the four grooves forms a slightly depressed fossa (usually situated to the right of the internalOCCIPITAL BONE. 89 occipital protuberance), upon â– \vhicli rests the torcular Heropliili. In the centre of the basilar portion of the bone is the foramen viagnum, oblong in form, and larger behind than Ijefore, transmitting the sjjinal cord and its membranes, the spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral and posterior meningeal arteries, and having its anteiio]- constricted portion occupied by the tip of the odontoid process of the axis. Upon tlie lateral margins of the foramen magnum are two rougli eminences, which give attachment to the odontoid ligaments, and immediately above these, the openings of the anterior condylar foramina. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, grooved on its surface for supporting the medulla oblongata, and along each lateral border for tlie inferior petrossal sinus. On each side of the fgramen magnum is a groove, for the termination of the lateral sinus ; a smootli surface, which forms part of the jugular Fig. 94.â€”Internal surface of the occi- pital bone.

The superior borders are strongly serrated, and assist in forniin^^ the laniljdoidal suture ; the inferior are rough, not serrated, ancl articulate with tlie mastoid portion of the temporal bones The jugular eminence and side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of tlie temporal bone, and the intervenino- space which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The angles oi tlie occipital 1jone are, tlie superior, inferior, and two lateral. The sujmior angle is received into tlie interval formed by the union ot the posterior and superior angles of the imrietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of tlie fwtal head which isPARIETAL BONE. 90 called the posterior fordanelle. The inferior angle is the extremity ol" the basilar process, which in the adult is united with the sphenoid. The lateral angles, at each side, project into tlie interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal M'ith the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.â€”By seven centres ; four for the four parts of the expanded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condylai- part and one for the Imsilar portion. Ossification commences in the expanded portion of the bone during the eighth week. At birth the bone consists of four distinct pieces, called respectively supra- occipital, two ex-occipitals, and basi-occipital, the division between the basi- occipital and each ex-occipital passing througli the anterior thii'd of the condyles. The three first unite during the third or fourth year, the last joins them about the fourth to the sixth year. After twenty- five the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. The part above the occipital protuberances is developed from membrane, the rest from cartilage. Articulations.â€”With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To ticelve pairs ; to the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis, trapezius and sterno-mastoid; to the rough space betioeen the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis ; to the sjMce hetiveen the inferior curved line and foramen magmm, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior ; to thi^ transverse process, the rectus lateralis ; and to the basilar process, the rectus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle con- strictors of the pharynx. PARIETAL BONE. The parietal Ijone (paries, a wall) is situated at the side and vertex of the skull; it is fpiadrilateral in form, and di^dsible into an Fig. 95.â€”External surface of the left parietal bone. i.

The superior border is straight, to articulate with its fellow of thePARIETAL BONE. 91 opposite side. Tlie inferior border is arched and thin, to ai-ticulate with, the temporal bone. The anterior border is concave, and the posterior somewhat convex. External Surface.â€”Crossing the bone in a longitudinal direction from the anterior to the posterior border, is an arched line, the ieÂ»)- poral crest, to which the temporal fascia is attached. Beneath this in â– w'ell-raarked specimens, and separated from it by a very nai'row interval, is a second line limiting the attachment of the temporal muscle. In the middle of these lines, and nearly in the centre of the bone, is the projection called the parietal eminence, which marks the centre of ossification. Above the temporal crest the surface is rough, and covered by the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis ; below the crest the bone is smooth, for +he attachment of the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle. Near the superior border of the bone, and at about one-third from its posterior extremity, is the parietal jforamen, which transmits a vein to the suj^erior longitudinal sinus. This foramen is often absent. Internal Surface.â€”The internal table is smooth; it is marked by numerous furrows, which lodge the ramifications of the middle Fig. 96.â€”Internal surface of the left parietal bone. i.

Along the upper border is part of a shallow groove, completed by the opposite parietal bone, which serves to contain the superior longitudinal sinus. Near this groove, some slight pits, which lodge the Pacchio- nian Ijodies, are also observable. llha anterior inferior angle is thin and lengthened, and articulates mth the ti]) of the gi'eat wing of the sphenoid bone. Its inner surface IS deeply grooved for the middle meningeal artery; the groove Ijemg frequently converted into a closed canal. The posterior ii^erior anyle is thick, and presents a broad and shallow groove for the lateral sinus. 1FHONTAL BONE. 92 Development.â€”Ossified in membi'ane from a single centre wliicli appears in tlie parietal eminence in the seveutli week. At the time of birth the superior angles are unossifiecl, and intervals are thus left between the parietal and frontfil in front, and the parietal and occipital behind ; tliese are called tlie anterior and posterior fonta- nelles. Articulations.â€”With five bones; with the opposite ^jarietal, occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles.â€”I'o one only, the temporal. The aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis glides over its upper surface. FRONTAL BONE. The frontal bone bears some resemblance in form to the under valve of a scallop-shell. It is situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead, and assisting in the construction of the roof of the orbits and nose. Hence it is divisible into a superior or frontal portion, and an inferior or orbito-nasal portion. Each of these portions presents for examination an external and internal surface, borders, and processes. External Surface.â€”At about the middle of each lateral half of the frontal portion is a jDrojection, the frontal eminence. Below these Fig. 97.â€”External surface of the fi-ontal bone. i.

Nasal spine. points are the superciliary ridges, lai'ge towards their inner termina- tion, where they become continuous with the na.sal tuberosity, and becoming gradually smaller as they arch outwards: they support the eyebrows. Beneath the superciliary ridges are the sharp and prominent arches which form the upper margin of the orbits, the supraorbital ridges. Externally the supraorbital ridge terminates in the external angular fvocess, internally in the internal angular j^roccss;PLATE 2.I 193 FEONTAL BONE. at the inner tliivd of tliis ridge is a notch, sometimes conveL'ted into a foramenâ€”the supraorbital notch, wliich gives passage to the supra- orbital artery, veins, and nerve. Between the two superciliary ridges is a projection, the glabella; this portion of the bone denotes by its prominence the situation of the frontal sinuses. Extending upwards and backwards from the external angular process is a sharij ridge, the commencement of the temporal crest, and beneath the ridge a depressed surface, forming part of the temporal fossa, and giving attachment to the temporal muscle. The orbito-nasal portion of the bone consists of two thin processes, the orbital plates, which form the roof of the orbits, and an interven- ing notch which lodges the ethmoid bone, and is called the ethmoidal fissibve. The edges of the ethmoidal fissure are hollowed into cavities, Avhich, by their union with the ethmoid bone, complete the eth- moidal cells. Crossing these edges transversely are two small grooves, which are converted into canals by articulation with the ethmoid : these are the anterior and posterior internal orbital (or ethmoidal) canals; they open on the inner wall of the orbit,â€”the anterior transmitting the anterior ethmoidal vessels and nasal nerve, the posterior giving passage to the posterior ethmoidal vessels. At the anterior termination of these edges are the irregular openings which lead into the frontal sinuses ; and between the two internal angular j)rocesses is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a projecting process, the nasal spine. On each orbital plate, imme- diately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which lodges the lachrymal gland ; and beneath the internal angular process a small pit {trochlear fossa), sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye is attached. Internal Surface.â€”Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri, the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid Ijone, t\\e foramen ccecum: This opening lodges a process of the dura mater, and occasionally gives passage to a small vein which communicates with the nasal veins. On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the Pacchio- nian bodies, and branching grooves for meningeal vessels. There are also numerous shallow depressions called digital fossm, which correspond with the convolutions of tlie anterior lobes of the cerebrum ; these are especially distinct on the orbital plates. The superior bonier is thick and strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the internal table in the middle, where it rests on the junction of the two parietal, and at the expense of the external table on each side where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones. The inferior border is thin, irregular, and squamous, and articulates with the sphenoid bone.

TEMPORAL BONE. le temporal bone is situated at the side and base of the skull. Tl and contains in its interior the into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion organ of hearing. It is divisible95 TEMPOEAL BONE. / .iMi MM The Squamous portion (nquama, a scale), forming the anterior part of the bone, is tliin, transhicent, and contains no cliploe. On its external surface it is smooth, gives attachment to the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle, and is marked by a small groove running almost vertically upwards, for the posterior deep temporal artery. It has projecting from it an arched and lengthened process, the zygoma (from ^i^yoj,'a yoke, because it joins the temporal and malar bones together), which, as it passes forwards, becomes twisted in itself. Near the commencement of the zygoma, upon its lower border, is a projection called the tubercle, to which is attached tlie external lateral ligament of the lower j'aw, and continued horizontally in- wards from the tubercle, a rounded eminence, the eminentia articu- laris. The process of bone which is continued from the tubercle of the zygoma into the eminentia articularis is the inferior root of the zygoma. The superior root is continued upwards from the upper Fio. loo.â€”External surface of the temporal bone of the left side. / I. Squamous portion. 2. Mastoid portion. 3.

The upper border of the zvgoma is thin' and sharp, and has attached to it the fibres of the temporal fascia ; the lower border is thick, and gives origin to some fibres of the masseter muscle. The interned surface of the sqiiamous portion is marked by several shallow fossae, which correspond with the convolutions of the cerebrum, and by a furrow for the posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. The su-jierior or squamous border is very thin, and bevelled at the expen.se of the inner surface, so as to overlap the ower and arched border of the parietal bone. The inferior border IS thick, and dentated to articulate with the -spinous process of theTEMPORAL BONE. 96 The Mastoid portion (fiaa-Tos etSof, nipple-like) forms the posterior part of the bone ; it is thick and hollowed between its tables into nuniei'ous cavities. Those situated near the apex and back part of the l^one are small and generally filled with marrow ; the upper and anterior cavities, much larger in size, contain air, and are m com- munication with the tympanic cavity. One of the latter, largei' and more constant than the rest, is named the ^mastoid antrum. Ou its external surface the mastoid portion is rough for the attachment of muscles, and near the posterior border of the bone is an irregului' opening, sometimes large, and sometimes so small as to be almost indistinguishable, called the mastoid foramen, which transmits ii vein to the lateral sinus, and a small artery to the dura mater. The; inferior part of the mastoid portion is round and expanded, the mastoid process. Directly to the inner side of, and partly concealed by it, is a deep groove, the digastric fossa, for the digastric muscle, and a little more internally the occipital groove, which lodges the occipital artery, a branch of the external carotid. On its internal surface the mastoid portion presents a broad and shallow groove (fossa sigmoideu) for the lateral sinus, and terminating in this groove the internal opening of the mastoid foramen.

Part of carotid canal. portion is dentated, and articidates with the posterior inferior angk^ of the parietal bone ; its posterior border is thick, and less serrated, and articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone. The external auditory meatus is a slightly curved canal, about half an inch in length, and rather longer on its floor than on its roof ; it is narrower in the middle than at either end, and is broadest in its horizontal diameter, and terminates at the outer wall of t\u' tympanum by an abru]3t oval border. Within the margin of this border is a groove for the insertion of the membrani tympani. The Petrous portion of the temporal bone is named from its extreme hardness and density (neTpos, a rock). It is a three-sided pyramid, projecting horizontally forwards into the base of the skull, the base being partly applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, and partly exposed as the opening of the ear ; its apex is received into the triangular interval between the spinous process of the sphenoid and the basilar jjrocess of the occipital bone. For convenience of description it is divisible into base, apex, three surfaces, anterior, ])osterior, and 1)asilar; an( three borders, superior, anterior, and posterior. The base is pierced by the external auditory meatus, sui-rounded by a rough process97 TEMPORAL BONE. of bone, the auditori/ process, whicli, when traced backwards, is seen to be continuous with the bone ensheathing the styloid process. The apex of the petrous bone is pierced by the inner opening of the carotid canal, and forms the posterior and external boundary of the middle lacerated foramen. The anterior surface, forming the back part of the middle fossa of the base of the skull, presents from base to apex, firstly, a slight depression, whicli corresponds to the position of the roof of the tympanic cavity; next, an eminence caused by the projection of the superior semicircular canal; thirdly, a groove leading to an irregular oblique opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the transmission of the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve ; another and smaller oblique foramen, immediately beneath the preceding, for the passage of the lesser petrosal nerve ; and lastly, near the apex of the bone, a depression for the Gasserian ganglion. The posterior surface forms the front of the posterior fossa of the skull; near its middle is the oblique entrance of the meatus audilorius internus, which gives passage to the seventh and eighth nerves and the auditory artery. Above the meatus auditorius in- ternus is a small oblique fissiu-e, and a minute fora- men ; the former lodges a process of the dura mater, and the foramen gives passage to a small vein. Furtlier out- wards, towards the mastoid portion of the bone, is a small slit, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone ; this is the aquceductus vestihuli, and transmits a small artery and vein of the vestibule and a process of dura mater. Below the meatus, and partly concealed by the margin of the posterior border of the bone, is a triangular opening, the termination of the aquceductus cochlem, through which passes a vein from the cochlea to the inferior petrosal sinus, and a process of dura mater.

At the base of this process is a rough sheaith-like ridge, into which the styloid process appears implanted, the var/inal process or tympanic lamina ; it is continuous externally with the auditory process. In front of the vaginal process is a broad triangular depression, the glenoid fossa, bounded in front by the eminentia articidaris, behind by the vaginal process, and externally by the rough lip of the audi- tory process. The glenoid fossa (y\Tjvr], a socket) is divided transversely by the ^ Fio. 103.â€”Left temporal bone, seen from within, i. Squamous portion. 2. Mastoid portion.

At the inner extremity of the fissure a minute canal terminates, canul of Hnyaier; it transmits the chorda tympani nerve. The surface of the fossa in front of the fissure is smooth, to articulate with the condyle of the lower jaw ; and that behind the fissure rough, for the rece])tion of part of the ]iarotid gland. At the extremity of the inner angle of the glenoid fossa is the opening of the Eustachian tube; al)ove this, and separated from it by a thin lamella of bone, called j^roccsnis coch- leariformis, is. a small canal for the transmission of the tensor tympani muscle.PLATE 3.99 TEMPORAL BONE. Directly behind, and at tlie root of the styloid process, is the stylo- mastoid foramen, the opening of exit of the facial nerve, and entrance of the stylo-mastoid artery ; and a little in front of this, between the mastoid and vaginal processes, is a small slit, the auricular fissure, for the exit of the auricnlar branch of the pneumogastric (Arnold's nerve). Midway between the styloid process and apex of the bone is a large oval opening, the foramen of entrance of the internal carotid artery and carotid plexns of nerves into the carotid canal. Between the stylo-mastoid and carotid foramen, in the posterior border, is an irregular excavation forming part of the jugular fossa for the commencement of the internal jugular vein, on the inner wall of which will he found a minute foramen, for the entrance of Arnold's nerve. The share of the jugular fossa formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone is different in different bones ; but in all the fossa ]3resents a vertical ridge on its inner side, which cuts off a small portion from the rest. The upper part of tliis ridge forms a spinous projection, the jugular ])^'ocess; the groove to the inner side of the ridge lodges the ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves, and the lower part of tlie ridge is the septum of division lietween the jugular fossa and carotid foramen. Upon the latter portion of the ridge, near the posterior margin of the carotid foramen, is a small opening leading into a canal wliich transmits the tympanic Ijranch of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve (Jacobson's nerve). The superior border of the petrous portion is sharj^, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. It is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, and near its extremity is marked by a smooth notch, upon which reclines the fifth nerve. The anterior border is grooved for the Eustachian tube, and forms the posterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii ; by its sharp extrenaity it gives attach- ment to the tensor tympani, and levator palati muscle. The pos- terior border is grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus, and excavated for the jugular fossa : it forms the anterior boundary of the jugular foramen. Development.â€”The temporal bone is developed in four portions, the sqiMmo-zygomatic, tympanic, petro-mastoid (or periotic), and styloid. Ossification commences in the scpiamo-zygomatic portion about the seventh week. In the third month ossific deposits appear in the floor of the outer wall of the tympanum, and extending iipwards form a circle, the tympanic ring, which is defective al)ove ; it joins the squamo- zygomatic portion in the ninth month. In the petro- mastoid ])orti()n ossification begins in the fifth montli, ^^o. 104.â€”The taking phice by four distinct osseous deposits; one f-in^'of" "the for the promontory {opisthotic), one for the greater foetal skull, part of the petrous l)one seen in the base of the "gi"side. skull (jn-ootic), a third in connection with the posterior semicircular canal aiid lower part of the mastoid (eviotic), and a fourth forming the roof of the tympanum and covering of the external semicircular canal {yterotic); these centres all fuse by the end of the sixth monthSPHENOID BONE. 100 The styloid process is commonly formed by two osseous deposits, one (the tijmpano-hyal) at the base, before birth ; the other (dijlo-hyal) at the tip, after birth ; the latter often remains separate during the whole of life. The squamo-zygomatic portion is developed from membrane, the other j)ortions from cartilage. At the time of birth the temporal iDone consists of three pieces ; the mastoid antrum is present, but the mastoid cells do not commence to be formed till the ninth year. From the above description it will be seen that the total number of centres of ossification is eight. Articulations.â€”With five bones : occipital, parietal, sphenoid, inferior maxillary, and malar. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To fourteen: by squamous portion, to the temporal; by the zygoma, to the masseter ; l)y the mastoid portion, to the occipito-frontalis, splenius capitis, sterno-mastoid, trachelo-mastoid, digastricus, and retrahens auriculam ; by the styloid process, to the stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-hyoid, stylo-glossus, and two ligaments, stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary; and by the petrozis portion, to the levator palati, tensor tympani, and stapedius. SPHENOID BONE. The sphenoid (acjiriv, a wedge) is an irregular bone, situated at the base of the skull, wedged between the other bones of the cranium, and entering into the formation of the cranium, orbits, and nasal fossae. It bears some resemblance, in form, to a bat with its wings extended, and is divisible into body, wings, and processes. The body forms the central mass of the bone, from which the wings and processes are projected. From the upper and anterior part of the body extend, one to each side, two small triangular plates, the lesser wings; from each side, and expanding laterally, are the greater wings; proceeding backwards from the base of the greater Wings, the spinous processes, and downwards, the pterygoid processes. The body presents for examination a superior or cerebral surface, an antero-inferior surface, and a posterior surface. Superior Surface.â€”At the anterior extremity of this surface is a small projecting plate, the ethmoidal spine, which articulates with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid ; and spreading out on each side the lesser loings. Behind the ethmoidal spine in the middle line is a shallow transverse groove which lodges the optic commissure; behind this is a rounded elevation, the olivary process; and on each side of the posterior margin of that process a tubercle, the middle chnmd 2?rocess (KXivrj, a bed). Passing outwards and forwards from the groove just mentioned are the optic foramina, which transmit the optic nerves and ophthalmic arteries. Behind the optic foramina are two sharp tuljercles, the anterior clinoid processes, which are the inner terminations of the lesser wings. Beneath these processes, on the sides of the olivary process, are two depressions for the last turn ot the internal carotid arteries ; they are often converted into foraminalOI SPHENOID BONE. {carotico-cUnoid) by a spicule of bone uniting the anterior and middle clinoid processes. Behind the olivary process is the sella turcica, the deep fossa which lodges the ^^ituitary gland and circiilai- sinus ; behind and somewhat overhanging the sella turcica, is a broad rough plate, dorsum sella:, bounded at each angle by a tubercle, the 2)nsterior clinoid processes; and behind tliis plate an inclined surface (clivus Blumenbachii), which is continuous with the basilar jDrocess of the occipital bone, and sujDports the Pons Varolii. On each side of the sella turcica is a broad groove {carotid or cavernous yroove); it is bounded externally at its back part by a well-marked ridge called the lingula sphenoidalis. The carotid groove lodges the internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus, orbital nerves, and cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. Opposite the middle of the sella tiircica the Fio. 105.â€”Superior or cere- bral surface of the sphen- oid bone. I. Olivary pro- cess. 2. Ethmoidal spine. 3. Lesser wing of the left side. 4.

On eacli side of the sphenoidal cells are the outlets of the optic foramina, and other openings to l)e presently described ; the lesser and greater wings; and, l)elow, the pterygoid processes. At the under surface of the body are two thin plates of bone {vaginal processes), proceeding fi-om the base of the pterygoid process at each side, articulating with the alse of the vomer. On each of these plates, close to tlie root of the pterygoid process, is a groove converted into a canal Ijy the palate bone, t\i& fterygo-palatine canal for the pterygo-palatine nerve and pharyngeal artery ; and traversing the root of the jjterygoid process at its union with the body of the bone, is the ptenjgoid or Vidian canal, which gives passage to the Vidian nerve and artery. The posterior surface of the body is flat and rough, and articu- lates with the l^asilar process of the occipital bone ; after the twenty- lifth year this union is usually completed by iDone. The posterior surface is continuous at each side A\'ith the spinous process, and in the angle of union is the termination of the Vidian canal. The lesser wings (orbito-sphenoids) are thin and triangular, the base being attached to the upper and anterior part of the body of the sphenoid ; and the apex, jjrolonged outwards, terminating in an Fig. io6.â€”Aiitero-inferior view of the sphenoid bone. i.

The inner extremity of this border is the' anterior clinoid process ; it is sup- poi'ted by a short pillar of bone, which forms the inferior boundary of the optic foramen, and gives attachment by its anterior surface to part of the common tendon of the muscles of the orbit. The lesser wing forms the posterior part of the roof of the orbit.

The superior surface is concave, and receives the anterior part of the temporo-splienoidal lobe of the cerebrum ; at its internal border, where the greater wing joins the body, and immediately behind the sphenoidal fissure, is a circular opening, foramen rotundum, through which passes the superior maxillary branch of the fifth nerve. Behind and external to this, is a large foramen c^Wadi foramen ovale; it transmits the inferio]' maxillary di\asion of tlie fifth nerve, the small meningeal artery, and lesser petrosal nerve. At the inner side of the foramen ovale a small opening is sometimes found ; it is the foramen Vesalii, and transmits a small vein. The anterior or orbital surface looks into the orbit; it is cpiadrilateral in shape, and its posterior border, which bounds the sphenoidal fissure inferiorly, is usually marked by a slight pro- minence, for the attachment of part of the external rectus muscle ; its inferior edge forms the outer boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure ; its outer edge is rough for articulation with tlie malar bone. The superior part of the external surface enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, the inferior portion forms part of the zygomatic fossa. Tlie ptenjgoid ridge, dividing the two, gives attachment to the upper origin of the ]Dterygoideus externus muscle. The spinous processes are the posterior terminations of the greater wings ; they project backwards, and are received into the angular interval between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bones. Near its apex each process is pierced by a small opening, foramen spinosum, for the middle meningeal vessels, and extending downwards from the apex is a short spine, which gives attachment to the long internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and to the laxator tympani muscle. The external border of the spinous process is rough, to articulate with the lower border of the squamous portion of the temporal bone ; the internal border forms the anterior Ijoundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and is somewhat grooved for the reception of the Eustachian tube. The pterygoid processes descend perpendicularly from the base of the greater wings, and form in the articulated skull the lateral boundaries of the posterior nares. Each process consists of an ex- ternal and internal plate, partly united in front, but divergent beliind, so as to enclose a space called the pterygoid fossa, and sepa- rated below by an interval, the pterygoid notch, which receives the tuberosity of the palate bone. The external plate is broad and thin, giving attachment, by its external surface, to the external pterygoid muscle, and by its internal surface to the internal pterygoid. The internal pterygoid plate is long and narrow, terminating at its extre- mity by a curved hook, the ham.ular process, around which plays theI04 SPHENOID BONE. tendon of the tensor palati muscle, and to tlie tip of wliicli the pterygo-maxilhxry ligament is attached ; while from the lower third of its posterior )jorder some ftljres of the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx have their origin. At tlie base of the internal pterygoid plate is a small oblong depression, the sca])hoid or navicular fossa, froia which arises the circumflexus or tensor palati muscle. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is broad near its base ; it forms the posterior wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and sup- ports Meckel's ganglion. At its lower' part this surface is slightly grooved, to form part of the descending palatine canal. The base of the pterygoid process is pierced by the Vidian canal. Development.â€”Up to the seventh or eighth month of intra- uterine existence, the anterior and posterior parts of the Ijody of the sphenoid are distinct from each other ;â€”the anterior part, extending from the posterior border of the olivary process to the ethmoidal spine, being called jne-sjjhenoid, and the posterior portion, from the border of the olivary process to the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, the post-sphenoid. The sphenoid is developed by fourteen centres of ossification, four for the pre-sphenoid, six for the post-sphenoid, two for the internal pterygoid plates, and two for the sphenoidal spongy bones. The first pre-sphenoidal centres appear at the outer side of the optic foramina, about the eighth or ninth week. These are soon followed by another pair of centres, jDlaced to the inner side of the optic fora- mina. From these four centres the anterior part of the body of the sphenoid and the lesser wings are developed. About the eighth week ossific nuclei appear in the greater wings (ali-sphenoids) between the foramen ovale and rotundum. From this ^^oint ossification ex- tends into the whole of the great wing and the external pterygoid plate. In the eighth week also, or a little later, two centres appear in the post-sphenoidal portion of the body (basi-sphenoids), jDlaced side by side in the bottom of the sella turcica. These unite about the fourth month, and after their union two new centres spring up at the other side of the carotid groove, and form the lingula {sphen- otics). The centres for the internal pterygoid ^jrocesses appear about the fourth month, and they unite with the external jjterygoid about the sixth month. The sjDhenoidal sjjongy bones do not become ossified till after birth ; they join the rest of the bone at the time of puberty. At the time of birth the sphenoid consists of three piecesâ€”the body in the centre, and on each side the great wings Avitli the ex- ternal pterygoid plates. They unite during the first year. The sphenoidal cells first begin to appear at about seven years of age. The sphenoid joins the occipital from the eighteenth to the twenty- fifth year.

ETHMOID BONE. The ethmoid (rjdfxos, a sieve) is a square-shaped cellular bone, situated betAveen the two orbits, at the root of the nose, and per- forated on its upper surface by a number of small openings, from which peculiarity it has received its name. It consists of a horizontal plate, a perpendicular lamella, and two lateral masses. The horizontal or cribriform plate connects the lateral masses vntli the jjerpendicular lamella, and is situated on the upper asj^ect of the bone. It is hollowed into two shallow grooves (olfactory grooves) which support the olfactory bulbs, and is pierced by numerous fora- mina, for the filaments of the olfactory nerve. In the middle of each groove the foramina pierce the bone comj)letely, but at the sides the openings communicate with minute canals which run in the sides of the central lamella, the lateral masses and turbinated bones. At the anterior extremity of the cribriform plate are two narrow slits, for the nasal branch of the fifth nerve ; its posterior border articu- lates with the ethmoidal spine of the sphenoid. The perpendicular lamella is a thin central plate, which articu- lates by its anterior border with the frontal spine and crest of the Fig. 107.â€”Ethmoid bone seen from above and be- hind. I.

Its inferior border is broad and bilaniinar ; it articulates with the septal cartilage of the nose. It is sunnounted superiorly by a thick and strong process, the crista qalli, Avhich projects mto the cavity of the skull, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri. From the Imse of the anterior border of this process there project forward two small plates, alar processes, which are re- ceived into corresponding depressions in the frontal bone, and often complete posteriorly the foramen ccecum. That portion of the per- pendicular plate which lies below the level of the cribriform plate assists m forming the septum of the nose.ETHMOID BONE. io6 llie lateral masses or labyrinths are divisiljle into an internal and external surface, and lour Ijordei's, superior, inferior, anterior and posterior. ' The infernal surface is rough, sliglitly convex, and forms the- external boundary of the upper part of tlie nasal fossae. Towards tlie posterior liorder of this surface is a narrow horizontal fissure, the mjmior meatus of the nose ; the u])pei' niai-gin of tliis fissure is tliin, and somewhat curled inwards ; hence it is named the superior turbinated bone. Below the meatus is the convex surface of another thin plate, which is curled outwai'ds, and forms the lower border of the mass, the middle turbinated bone. The external surface is quadrilateral and smooth ; hence it is named os jjlanum; it enters into the formation of the inner wall of the orbit. The superior border is uneven and cellular, the cells being com- pleted by the edges of the ethmoidal fissure of the frontal bone. This border is crossed by two grooves, sometimes complete canals, opening into the orl)it by the anterior and jjosterior internal orbital foramina. The inferior- border is formed internally by the lower border of the middle turbinated bone, and externally by a concave irregular fossa, the upper boundary of the middle meatus. The anterior border presents a number of incomplete cells, Avhich are closed by the superior maxillaiy and lachrymal bones ; the posterior border is irregularly cellular, to articulate with the sphenoid and palate bone. From the anterior part of each lateral mass an irre- gular plate of bone descends backwards, terminating in a hook-like extremity : this is called the unciform process. It assists in closing the orifice of the antrum, and articulates with the ethmoidal pro- cess of the inferior turbinated bone. The lateral masses are composed of cells, divided by a thin j)ar- tition into anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The anterior, the most numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses, and open by means of an irregular and incomplete tubular canal, the infundi- bulum, into the middle meatus. The posterior cells, fewer in nimiber, open into the superior meatus. Development.â€”By three centres : one for each lateral mass, and one for the perpendicular lamella. Ossification commences in the lateral masses at about the beginning of the fifth month, appearing first in the os planum, and then in the turbinated bones. At birth the bone merely consists of two ill-developed lateral masses. Dm-ing the latter half of the first year after birth, the central lamella and cribriform plate begin to ossify, and are united to the lateral masses by the beginning of tlie second year. The cells of the ethmoid are developed in the course of the fourth and fifth year. Articulations.â€”With thirteen bones : two of the cranium, frontal and sphenoid ; and eleven of the face, viz., two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, two j)alate, two inferior turbinated, and vomer. No muscles are attached to this bone.NASAL BONES. BONES OF THE FACE. The face is composed of fourteen bonesâ€”namely, Two nasal, Two palate. Two superior maxillary. Two inferior turbinated. Two lachrymal. Vomer, Two malar. Inferior maxillary. NASAL BONES. The nasal are two small quadrangular bones, forming by their union the bridge and l)ase of the nose. They are convex on their outer surface, and pierced by a foramen for a small vein ; on the inner surface they are somewhat concave, and marked by a groo^'e which lodges the nasal branch of the ojihthalmic ner^'e. The siiperior ])order is narrow and thick ; the inferior broad, thin, and irregular. The anterior border, thick above and thin below, articulates with the bone of the opposite side. The external border is thin and irregular ; it is bevelled at the exj)ense of the inner surface above, and of the outer sui'face below, and articulates with the nasal process of the superior maxillary. Development.â€”By a single centre for each bone, ossification com- mencing in the seventh week. Articulations.â€”AVith four bones : frontal, ethmoid, nasal, and superior maxillary. Attachment of Muscles.â€”It has in relation with it the pyrami- dalis nasi and compressor nasi ; but neither is inserted into it. SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. The superior maxillary are the largest bones of the face, with the exception of the lower jaw ; they form, by their imion, the whole of the upper jaw, and assist in the construction of the nose, orbit, cheek, and palate. Eacli bone is divisible into a body and four processes. The body is triangular in form, and hollowed in its interior into a large cavity, the antrum maxillare (antrum of Highmore). It presents for examination four surfaces, external or facial, internal or nasal, posterior or zygomatic, and superior or orbital. The external or facial surface forms the anterior part of the Fig. io8.â€”Nasal bone of the left side ; its external or convex surface, i. Suf)erior border. 2. Internal or mesial border. 3.

The myrtiform fos.sa is divided from the canine fossa by a perisen- dicular ridge {cunine ridge) corresponding with the root of the canine tooth. The inferior boundary of the facial surface is the alveolar jDrocess which contains the teeth of the upper jaw ; and the facial is separated from the zygomatic surface by a strong projecting eminence, the malar process. The internal or nasal surface presents a large irregular opening, leading into the antrum ; this opening is nearly closed in the articu- lated skull by the ethmoid, palate, lachrymal, and inferior turbi- nated bone. In front of the opening of the antrum, is the strong ascending plate of the nasal process, marked inferiorly by a rough horizontal ridge, inferior tnrbinal crest, which gives attachment to the inferior turbinated bone. The concave depression immediately above this ridge corresponds with the middle meatus of the nose, that below the ridge with the inferior meatus. BetAveen the nasal process and the opening of the antrum is a deep vertical groove,PLATE 5.Itot SUPERIOE MAXILLARY BONES. converted into a canal by the laclirymal aiad inferior turbinated bone, and constituting the naaal duct.

The middle of this surface is channelled hj a deep gi-oove and canal, the infraorbital, which terminates at the infraorlntal foramen ; and near the root of the nasal process is a slight de- pression, marking the origin of the inferior oblique muscle of the eyeball. The four processes of the superior maxillary bone are, the nasal, malar, alveolar, and palate. The nasal process ascends hj the side of the nose, to which it forms the lateral boundary, and articulates with the frontal and nasal bones. By its external surface it gives attachment to the levator lahii superioris alceque nasi, and to the orUcularis palpebrarum muscle. Its internal surface contributes to form the outer wall of the nares, and is marked transversely by a horizontal ridge, sujierior turbinal crest, wliich divides it into two portions, one above the ridge irregular and uneven, for giving attachment to and completing the cells of the lateral mass of the ethmoid ; the other below, smooth and concave, corresponding with the middle meatus. The posterior border is thick, and grooved for the nasal duct; while the prominent margin in front of that groove is continuous with the lower border of the orbit; this margin is marked by a small tubercle {lachrymal tubercle), which serves as a guide to the introduction of the knife in opening into the lachrymal sac. The malar process, large and irregular, is situated at the angle of separation between the facial and zygomatic surface, and presents a triangular surface for articulation with the malar bone. The alveolar process forms the lower margin of the bone ; it is spongy and cellular in texture, and excavated into deep holes for the reception of eight teeth. By its outer surface, as far forwards as the first niolar tooth, it gives oiigin to the buccinator muscle. The ante- rior portion containing the sockets of the incisor teeth, together with a small jiortion of the palate process, has a separate centre of ossifica- tion, and in the lower animals remains separate througlioTit life as the intermaxillary or premaxillary bone. In young human skulls, a fissure riinning backwards from the outer edge of the second incisor nearly to the incisive foramen, indicates the line of junction of the premaxillary l^one with the rest of the maxilla ; and in cases of cleft palate (there hehig an arrest of development) this ])ortion is present as a distinct bone. The palate process is thick and strong, and projects horizontally inwards from the inner surface of tlie body of the bone. Superiorly, it is concave and smooth, and forms the floor of the nares ; inferiorli/, it is also concave, but uneven, and assists in the formation of tlie roof of the palate. The latter surface is marked by a deep groove, wliich lodges the antei'ior palatine nerve and artery. Its internal edge is raised into a ridge (nasal or palate crest), which, with a corresjionding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a grooA^e for the reception of theLACHRYMAL BONES. Ill vomer. The prolongation of this ridge forwards beyond the level of the facial siu^face of the bone is the nasal spine. Near the anterior extremity of the internal border is seen a deep groove, which, ex- panding' inferiorly, forms Avith its fellow of the opposite side the â– incidve foramen. When the hard palate (completed by the junction of the two bones) is viewed from below, this foramen is seen to con- tain four smaller foramina, two of which are placed in the middle line, one before the other (foramina of Scarpa), the anterior transmitting the left naso-palatine nerve and the posterior the right; the other two (foramina of Stenson), being placed laterally, form the entrance to the anterior palatine canals and give passage to the anterior palatine arteries. These all open above into the inferior meatus of the nose. Development.â€”By/o?(.r centres : one for the anterior part of the palate and incisive portion of the alveolar process (intermaxillary) ; one for that portion of the bone lying internally to the infraorbital canal and foramen; one for that portion lying externally to the infraorbital groove and canal; and one for the palate process. The antrum first begins to be formed about the fourth month of foetal life. The superior maxillary bone is one of the earliest to show signs of ossification, this action beginning in the alveolar prcjcess, and being associated with the early development of teeth. Articulations.â€”With nine bones ; viz., two of the cranium, and all the bones of the face, excepting the inferior maxillary. These are, frontal and ethmoid ; nasal, lachrymal, malai', inferior turbi- nated, palate, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side.

The crest is expanded inferiorly into a hook-shaped process (liamulus lachryinalis), which forms part of the outer boundary of the lachi-ymal groove. The internal surface is uneven, and completes the anterior ethmoidal cells ; it assists also in forming the wall of the nasal fossae. The upper border articulates with the frontal bone, the anterior border with the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and the posterior border with tlie os planum of the ethmoid. The lower border is divided into two portions by the vertical crest; the posterior part articulates with the orbital plate of the superior maxillary ; the anterior part is prolonged downwards (descending process) and joins the lachrymal process of the inferior turbinated.

The frontal ^;?'oce.ss ascends perpendicularly to form the outer border of the orbit, and articulates with the external angular process of the frontal bone. The orbital process is a thick plate, which pro- jects inAvards from the frontal process, and unites with the great wing of the sphenoid to constitute the outer wall of the orbit. The maxillary process is broad, and articulates with the superior maxil- lai-y bone. The zygomatic process, narrower than the rest, projects backwards to unite Avitla the zygoma of the tempoi'al bone. The jjostero-inferior border of the bone is strong and rough, and gives attachment by its internal aspect to the masseter muscle ; the postero-superior border is thin and sharp, for the attachment of the temporal fascia. Development.â€”By a single centre : in rare instances by two or three. In many animals the malar bone is permanently divided into two portions, orbital and malar.

The j^alate bones are situated at the posterior part of the nares, -where they enter into the formation of the palate, side of the nose, and posterior part of the floor of the orbit. Each bone resembles in general form the letter L, and is divisible into a horizontal plate, a perpendicular plate, and a pterygoid process or tuberosity. The horizontal plate is quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, Fio. 113.â€”Posterior view of the right palate bone in its natural position ; it is slightly tuiued on one side, to obtain a sight of the internal surface of the perpendicular plate (2).

The superior surface is concave, and rises towards its inner HPALATE BONES. 114 edge, where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side and forms part of a crest (nasal or 'palate crest), Avhicli articulates with the vomer. The inferior mrface is uneven, and niai'ked by a slight transverse ridge, to which is attached the tendinous expansion of the tensor palati muscle. Near its external boi'dei- are two openings, one large and one small, the jyosterior indatina foramina; they are the terminations of two minute canals, and transmit the descending palatine artery and nerves. The posterior' border is concave, and presents at its inner extremity a sharp point, which, Avitli a cori-e- sponding point in the opposite bone, constitutes the palate spine for the attachment of the azygos uvulae muscle. The perpendicular plate is also quadrilateral ; and presents two surfaces, one internal or nasal, forming part of the wall of the nares ; the other external, bounding the spheno-maxillary fossa and antrum. The internal surface is marked near its middle by a horizontal ridge (inferior turbinal crest), to which is united the inferior turbinated bone ; and about half an inch above this, by another ridge (superior turbinal crest), for the attachment of the middle turbinated bone.

Pterygoid pro- cess or tuberosity of the boue. The concave surface below the inferior ridge is the lateral boundary of the inferior meatus of the nose ; that between the tAvo ridges corresponds Avjth the middle meatus, and the surface above the superior ridge with the superior meatus. The external surface is rough on each side for articulation with neighbouring bones, and smooth in the middle to constitute the inner boundary of the spheno-maxillary fossa. This smooth surface terminates inferiorly in a deep groove, which, being completed by the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid, forms the descending jyalafine canal. Near the upper part of the perpendicular plate is a large oval notch completed by the sphenoid, the spheno-palatine foramen, which transmits the superior nasal aud naso-palatine nerves and spheno- palatine artery, and serves to divide the upper extremity of the lione into two portions, an anterior or orbital, and a posterior or sphenoidal portion. The orbital portion is hollow Avitliin, and pre- sents five surfaces externally, three articular and two free ; the tlu^ee articular are, anterior, which looks forward and articulates with theINFEKIOE TURBINATED BONES. superior maxilLary bone, internal with the ethmoid, and posterior with the sphenoid. The free surfaces are, superior or orbital, which forms the posteiior part of the floor of the orbit; and external, which looks into the spheno-maxillary fossa. The internal aspect generally sliows a hollow caA'ity which forms part of the posterior ethmoidal cell. The sphenoidal portion, much smaller than the orbital, has three surfaces, two lateral and one superior. The external lateral surface enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fossa ; the internal lateral forms part of the lateral boundary of the nares ; the superior surface articulates with the under part of the body of the sphenoid bone, and assists the sphenoidal spongy bones in closing the sphenoidal sinuses. This portion takes part in the formation of the pterygo-palatine canal. The pterygoid process or tuberosity of the palate bone is the thick and rough process which stands backAvards from the angle of union of the horizontal with the perpendicular portion of the bone. It is received into the angular fissure, which exists between the two plates of the pterygoid process at their inferior extremity, and pre- sents three surfaces : one concave and smooth, which forms part of the pterygoid fossa, and giA'es origin to some fibres of the internal pterygoid muscle ; and one at each side to articulate with the ptery- goid plates. Tlie anterior face of this process is rough, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. Development.â€”By a single centre, which ajjpears in the angle of union between the horizontal and perpendicular portion, in the seventh or eighth week. Articulations.â€”With six bones : two of the cranium, sphenoid and ethmoid ; and four of the face, superior maxillary, inferior tur- binated, vomer, and the palate bone of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To four: tensor palati, azygos uvulae, internal and external pterygoid. INFERIOR TURBINATED BONES.

The internal or convex mrface looks inwards and upwards, and forms the inferior boundary of the middle meatus of the nose ; it is marked l)y one or two longitudinal grooves or canals for branches of the nasal nerves and spheno-palatine ai-tery. The external or concave surface looks downwards and outwards, and constitutes the roof of the inferior meatus. The anterior border looks u])wards and forwards, is thin and somewhat concave, and articulates with the inferior turl^inal crest of the superior maxillary and with the lachrymal bone. The inferior border is convex, rounded, and free, and thicker than the rest of the bone. The anterior angle, attached to the superior maxillary bone, advances forward irearly to the anterior margin of the nares. The -posterior angle, sharp and pointed, is prolonged backwards on the internal pterygoid plate. The superior angle gives origin to three thin and laminated jDrocesses. The most anterior of these, lachrymal process, derived from the upper part of the anterior border, articulates with the lachrymal bone; it is grooved on the external aspect and assists in completing the nasal duct. The posterior process, ethmoidal process, derived directly from the superior angle, articulates with the unciform process of the ethmoid bone ; the middle process, maxillary process, proceeding also from the superior border, is reflected downwards, and assists in completing the inner wall of the antrum, articulating with the superior maxillary and palate bones. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held with its convex lower edge directed downwards, and the end nearest to the groove for the nasal duct looking forwards, the maxillary process will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Development.â€”By a single centre, which appears at about the fifth month of foetal life. It aftbrds no attachment to muscles. Articulations.â€”With four bones : ethmoid, superior maxillary, lachryiual, and palate. VOMER. The vomer {vomer, a ploughshare) is a thin, quadrilateral plate of bone, forming the posterioi' and inferior part of the septum of the nares. . . The superior border is Ijroad and expanded, to articulate, m the middle, with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid ; it has projecting on each side a horizontal process or ala, by means of which it articulates Avith the vaginal processes of the sphenoid. The anterior part of this border is hollowed into a sheath for the recep- tion of the rostrum of the sphenoid. The inferior border is thm and uneven, and is received into the grooved summit of the palate crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The posterior border is sharp and free, and forms the posterior division otINFEEIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 117 the two nares. Tlie anterior border is more or less deeplj' grooved for the reception of the central lamella of the ethmoid and the carti- lage fif the septum.

Development.â€”^By a single centre, which makes its appearance at the same time with those of the vertebrEe. Ossification begins from beloAV and proceeds iipwards. At birth, the vomer presents the form of a trough, in the concavity of which the cartilage of the septum nasi is placed ; it is tliis disposition which subsequently enables the bone to embrace the rostrum of the sphenoid. The vomer has no muscles attached to it. Articulations.â€”With .six bones : sphenoid, ethmoid, two superior maxillary, two palate ; and with the cai'tilage of the septum. INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The lower jaw or mandible is the arch of bone which contains the inferior teeth ; it is divisible into a horizontal portion or body, and a perpendicular portion, the ramus, at each side. The body is divisiljle into two portions. That above the mental foramen (alveolar) is of spongy texture, and contains the sockets for the teethâ€”that below this foramen (basilar) is thick and rounded ; it is dense in structure, and is marked Ijy ridges for the attacliment of nuiscles. Tlie relative proportion of these two parts varies with the age of the individual : in chiklhood, in consequence of contain- ing the two sets of teeth, the alveoUir portion is large, and the mental foramen is near the lower border of the bone ; in old age, on the contrary, from the loss of teeth and consequent absorption of the alveolar process, the basilar portion alone remains, and the mental foramen is situated near its upper boi'der. In adult age the alveolar and l)asilar portions are of equal depth, the mental foramen being situated midway between the upj)er and lower border. Upon the external surface of the boclij, at the middle line, andINFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. ii8 extending from between tlie two Jii'st incisor teeth to the chin, is a sliglit ridge, crista mmUdis, which indicates the point of conjunction of the lateral halves of the Ijone in the young subject, tlie symphysis. The ridge expands below into a ti-iangular eminence, tlie mental protuberance (or mentum), and this at the lower edge of the Ijone is marked by a slight depression, the menial dimple. Immediately external to this ridge is a depression which gives oi'igin to the de- pressor laljii inferioris muscle ; and, corresponding with the i-oot of the lateral incisor tooth, another depression, the incisive fossa, for the levator labii inferioris. A few fibres of the orbicularis oris (accessory fibres) are attached to the Imse of the alveolar jirocess, immediately aboA^e the incisive fossa. Fartlier outwards is an oblique opening, the mental foramen, for the exit of the mental ner^â– e and inferior dental artery ; and below tliis foramen, the commencement of a ridge, the external oblique ridge, which gives attachment to the depressor anguli oris. Near the posterior part of this surface is a rough impression made by the masseter muscle ; and, immediately in fi'ont of this impression, a groove for the facial artery. The external surface of the lower border of the bone gives attachment to some fibres of the platysma myoides muscle. The Imccinator muscle arises from the base of the alveolar process as far forwards as the first molar tooth. The projecting tiiberosity at the posterior extremity of the lower jaw, at the point where the body and ramus meet, is the angle. Upon the internal surface of the body of the bone, at the sym- physis, are two small pointed tubercles (mental tubercles); imme- FiG. 117.â€”The lower jaw. i. Body. 2. Ramus. 3. Symphysis. 4.

These four points give attachment, from alwve downwards, to the genio-hyo-glossi, genio-hyoidei, part of the mylo-hvoidei, and digastric muscles. Running outwards into the body of the bone from the above ridge is a prominent line, the mylo-hyoidean ridge, which gives attachment to the mylo-hyoid muscle ; aboA^e its pos- terior termination, and near the margin of the ah-eolar process, thePLATE 6. Mental I'orameu. Uep. labii inf.INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 119 superior constrictor muscle and pterygo-niaxillary ligament have their attachment. Immediately above the ridge, and by the side of the symphysis, is a smooth concave surface, which corresponds with the sublingual gland ; and below the ridge, and more externally, a deeper fossa for the submaxillary gland. The superior border of the body of the bone is the alveolar process, furnished in the adult with alveoli for sixteen teeth. The inferior border or base is rounded and smooth ; thick and everted in front to form the chin, and thinner behind where it merges into the angle of the bone. The ramus is a strong square-shaped process, differing in direction at various periods of life ; thus, in the foetus and infant, it is almost parallel with the body ; in youth it is oblique, and gradually ap- proaches tlie vertical direction until manhood ; in old age, after the loss of the teeth, it again declines, and assumes the oblique direction. On its external surface it is rough, for the attachment^ of the masseter muscle ; and at the junction of its posterior border with the body of the bone it has a rough tuberosity, the angle of the lower jaw, which gives attachment by its inner margin to the stylo- maxillary ligament. The upper extremity of the ramus presents two processes, sepa- rated by a concaA^e sweep, the sigmoid notch. The anterior is the coronoid process; it is sharp and pointed, and gives attachment to the temporal muscle. The posterior process is the condyle, which is flattened from before backwards, oblique in direction, and smooth on its upper surface, to articulate with the glenoid cavity of the temjDoral bone. The constriction around the base of the condyle is its nech, into the external aspect of which is attached the external lateral ligament. A fossa on the anterior part of the neck of the condyle gives attachment to the external pterygoid muscle. The sigmoid notch is crossed by the masseteric artery and nerve. The internal surface of the ramus is marked near its centre by a large oblique foramen, the inferior dental, for the entrance of the inferior dental artery and nerve into the dental canal. Bounding this opening is a sharp margin (lingiila mandibiolaris), to which is attached the long internal lateral ligament, and passing downwards from the opening a narrow groove which lodges the mylo-hyoid vessels and nerve. To the uneven surface above and in front of the inferior dental foramen is attached the' temiDoral muscle, and to the rough internal surface of the angle, the internal pterygoid. Development.â€”In its earliest condition the inferior maxilla consists of fibrous tissue investing a cartilaginous rod called the Curtilage of Meckel, formed in first post-oral or mandibular arch. Ossific deposit takes place (probably by several centres which fuse early), mainly in fibrous tissue, but the portion at the symphysis is formed Ijy direct ossification of the Cartilage of Meckel, and the condyle and back part of the ramus, including the angle, are formed from plates of cartilage unconnected with Meckel's cartilage. The lower jaw is the earliest of the bones of the skeleton to exhibitSUTURES. 120 ossification, with tlie exception of the clavicle. At the time of biilh it consists of two lateral halves united by fibrous tissue ; ossific union of the symphysis takes place during the first year. Articulations.â€”With the glenoid fossae of the two temporal bones, through the medium of a fibro-cartilage. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To fifteen pairs : by the external nur- /ace, commencing at the symphysis and proceeding outwards, levator labii inferioris, depressor labii inferioris, depressoi- anguli oris, platysma myoides, a few fibres of the orbicularis oris, buccinatoi-, and masseter; by the internal surface^ also commencing at the symphysis, the genio-hyo-glossus, genio-hyoid, mylo-hyoid, digas- tric, superior constrictor, temporal, external pterygoid, and internal pterygoid. SUTURES. The bones of the cranium and face are connected with each other by means of sutures {sutura, a seam). That is, the edges of the bone are roughened or uneven, are accurately adapted to each other, and united by a small quantity of fibrous tissue. When the j)rocess of union of the bones of the skull is retarded hj over-distension of the head, as in hydrocephalus, and sometimes without any such apparent cause, distinct ossific centres are developed in the interval between the edges ; and, being surrounded by the suture, form independent pieces which are called ossa triqueti-a, or ossa Wormiana. These are most frequently found in the lamb- doidal suture ; but one sometimes occurs at the junction of the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone with the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid ; it is called the pterion ossicle. The sutures may be divided into (i) those at the vertex, (2) those at the side of the skull, and (3) those at the base. Those at the vertex are the coronal, sagittal, and lamhdoidal. The coronal suture (Fig. 118) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, and connects the frontal with the parietal bones. In the formation of this suture the edges of the ai'ticulating bones are bevelled, so that the parietal rest on the frontal at each side, and in the middle the frontal rests on the parietal bones. The sagittal suture extends longitudinally backAvards along the vertex of the skull, from the middle of the coronal to the apex of the lambdoidal suture. It is much serrated, and serves to unite the two parietal bones. In the young subject, and soinetimes in the adult, this suture is continued through the middle of the frontal bone to the root of the nose, under the name of frontal suture. Ossa triquetra are sometimes found in the sagittal suture. The lambdoidal suture is named from some resemljlance to the Greek letter lamlxla (A), consisting of two branches, A\iiich diverge at an acute angle from the extremity of the sagittal suture. This suture connects the occipital with the jiarietal bones. The sutures at the side of the skull ai-e the squamo-farietal, the sjjheno-parietal, and the viasto-parietal.REGIOKS OF THE SKULL. 121 The squamo-parietal suture (Fig. ii8) unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone with the parietal, overlapping the lower border of the latter. The spheno-parietal suture is formed by the union of the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid with the anterior inferior angle of the j)arietal bone. The masto-parietal suture is the continuation backwards of the scpiamo-parietal; it unites the uj)per edge of the mastoid portion of tlie temporal with the back part of the lower border of the jDarietal. The sutures at the base of the skull are the basilar, petro-occipital, mastn-occijntal, petro-sphenoidal, and squamo-sphenoidal. The basilar suture is formed by the union of the basilar portions of the occipital and sphenoid bones ; it is obliterated by the fusion of the bones in early adult life. The masto-oceipital and petro-occipital sutures are continuous; the former runs between the posterior edge of mastoid, and the lower part of the lateral edge of the occipital; the latter is placed between the petrous portion of the temporal and the basi- and ex-occipital, and has in it the large opening called jugular foramen. The petro-sphenoidal suture is the short, irregular, union of the anterior edge of the petrous Ijone and the postei'ior border of the great wing of the sphenoid, and has in it the middle lacerated foramen. The squamo-sphenoidal suture is the continuation downwards of the squamo-parietal suture. Across the upper part of the face is an irregular suture, the trans- verse, which connects the frontal bone with the nasal, superior maxillary, lachrymal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and malar bones. REGIONS OF THE SKULL. The skull, considered as a whole, is di^asible into five regions : a superior region or vertex ; two lateral regions ; an inferior region or base ; and an anterior region, the face. The superior region, or vertex of the skull, is bounded anteriorlv by the frontal eminences ; on each side bv the temporal crest and parietal eminence ; and behind by the superior curved line of the occipital bone and occipital protuljerance. It is crossed transversely by the coronal suture, and marked from before backwards by the s^ttal, which terminates posteriorly in the lambdoidal suture. Near the posterior extreniitv of the region, and on each side of the sagittal suture, is tlie parietal foramen. The junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures is called the Iregma, and lies vertically above the external auditory meatus ; the junction of the sa^^ittal and lamlxloidal sutures is named the lambda, and is usually situated about 2^ in. above the external occipital protuberance (60 mm., Clark). The part of the vertex in the neighbourhood of122 KEGIONS OF THE SKULL. llie imrietal foramen is generally a little flattened ; it has received t lie name of ohelion. On the inner or cerehral surface of this region is a shallow groove^ extending along the middle line from before backwards, for the su])erior longitudinal sinus ; at each side of this groove are several small fossoe for the Pacchionian Ijodies, and farther outwai'ds, digital fossae corresponding with the convexities of the convolutions, and numerous ramified grooves for lodging the brandies of the meningeal arteries. Each lateral region of the slaill is divisible into three portions ; temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. The temporal portion or temporal fossa is bounded above and behind by the temporal crest, in front by the external angular process of the frontal and by the malar bone, and below by the zygoma.

The mastoid portion is rough, for the attachment of muscles. On its posterior part is the mastoid foramen ; and below, the mastoid process. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory meatus, surrounded by the external auditory process ; and in front of the meatus the glenoid cavity, bounded above l;)y the middle I'oot of the zygoma, and in front by the eminentia articularis. ;^The ziigomatic portion, or fossa, is the irregular ca\-ity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior niaxillar}^ bone, internallyREGIONS OF THE SKULL. 123 by the external pterygoid plate, above by the part of the great wing oi" the sphenoid external to the pterygoid ridge, and lower part of the squamous portion of the temporal l)one ; and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the loAver jaAv. It contains the external l^tervgoid, part of the temporal, and internal pterygoid muscles ; and the "internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve, with their branches. At the inner side and upper part of the zygomatic fossa are two fissures, spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary. The spheuo-maxUlary fissure, horizontal in direction, opens into the orbit, and is situated between the great wing of the sphenoid and the superior maxillary bone. It is completed externally by the malar bone. The ptcrygo-muxillary fissura is vertical, and descends at a right angle from the extremity of the preceding. It is situated between the pterygoid jjrocess and the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and transmits the internal maxillary artery. At the angle of junction of these two fissures is a small space, the spheno-maxillary fossa, bounded by the sphenoid, palate, and superior maxillary bones. The base of the skull presents an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar surface. The cerebral siirface is divisible into three parts, which are named anterior, middle, and posterior fossa of the base of the cranium. The anterior fossa is somewhat convex at each side, where it corre- sponds with the roof of the orbits ; and concave in the middle, in the situation of the ethmoid bone and interior part of the body of the sphenoid. The latter and the free edges of the lesser mngs constitute its posterior boundary. It supports the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. In the middle line of this fossa, at its anterior part, is the crista cialli; immediately in front of that process, the foramen cmcum, which gives passage to a small vein from the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus ; and on each side, the cribriforvi plate with its foramina, for the transmission of the filaments of the olfactory nerve, and a slit for the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. On the outer edges of the cribriform plate are seen the openings of the anterior and posterior internal orbital foramina. Farther ba,ck in the middle line is the olivary process, and, at the sides of this process, the optic foramina, anterior and middle clinoid processes, and vertical grooves for the internal carotid arteries. The middle fossa of the base, deeper than the preceding, is bounded in Iront by the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; behind, by the upper border of tlie petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and is divided into two lateral parts by the sella turcica. It is formed by the posterior part of the body, great wing, and spinous process of the .s]MienoicI, and by the petrous and sciuamous portion of the temijoral bones. In the centre of this fossa is the sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary gland and circular sinus, bounded in front bv the anterior and middle, and behind by the dorsum sellm and posterior climid processes. On each side of the sella tiu-cica is carotid groove lor the internal carotid artery, cavernous plexus of nervesREGIONS OF THE SKULL. 124 cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves; and farther outwards the lollowing foramina, from before backwards : Hphenoidcd fissure (fora- men lacerum anterius) for the transmission of tlie tliird, fourth, three branches of the ophthahuic division of the fifth, and the sixtli nerve, and ophthalmic vein ; foramen rotundum, for the superior maxillary nerve ; foramen ovale, for the inferior maxillary nerve, lesser meningeal artery, and lesser petrosal nerve; foramen Vesalii for a small vein ; foramen spinosum., for the middle meningeal artery ; foramen lacerum basis cranii (foramen lacerum medium), which is, in the recent state, closed in by fibrous tissue below, and is crossed by the internal carotid artery, carotid plexus, and petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve.

Towards the apex of the petrous portion is the notch for the fifth nerve, and below it a slight depression for the Gasserian ganglion. Farther outwards is the eminence which marks the position of the perpendicular semi-circular canal. Proceeding from the foramen spinosum are two groo^'es, which indicate the course of the trunks of tlie middle meningeal artery. The whole fossa lodges the temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the cerebrum. The fosterior fossa, larger than the other two, is formed by the occipital bone, petrous and mastoid portion of the temporals, and by a small part of the sphenoid and parietals. It is bounded in front by the uppei' border of the petrous portion and dorsum sella?, and125 REGIONS OF THE SKULL. along its posterior circumference by the groove for the lateral sinuses ; it giA^es support to the pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum. In the centre of this fossa is the foramen magnum, bounded at each side by a rough tubercle, Avhich gives attachment to the odontoid ligament, and by the anterior condylar foramen. In front of the foramen magnum is the concave surface which supports the medulla oblongata and j)ons Varolii, and on each side the following foramina, from before backwards. The i 11 ternal anditory meatus for the auditory and facial nerves and auditory artery; behind, and externally to this, is a small foramen leading into the aquceduchis vestibuli; and below it, partly concealed by the edge of the petrous bone, the aqucec/uctus cochlece; next, a long fissure, the foramen lacerum posterius ot jugular foramen, i:)artially divided into two by the jugular spine, the outer portion giving passage to the termination of the inferior petrosal and lateral sinuses, and the inner to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh j^airs of nerves. Converging towards this foramen from behind is the deep groove of the lateral sinus, and from the front the groove for the inferior petrosal sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is the internal occipital crest, which gives attachment to the falx cerebelli, and divides the two inferior fossae of the occipital l^one; and above the ridge is the internal occipital protuberance, the transverse groove lodging the lateral sinus, and the transverse ridge giving attachment to the tentorium â€¢cerebelli. The external surface of the base of the skull is extremely uneven. From before backwards it is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones ; the vomer ; pterygoid, spinous processes, and part of the body of the sphenoid ; under surface of the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portion of the temporals ; and by the occipital bone. The palate processes of the superior maxil- lary and palate bones constitute the hard palate, which is raised above the level of the rest of the base (when the skull is turned over for the purpose of examination), and is surrounded by the alveolar processes containing the teeth of the upper ja.M\ At the anterior extremity of the hard palate, and directly behind the front incisor teeth, is the anterior palatine or incisive foramen, Avhich transmits the naso-palatine nerves and anterior palatine arteries. At the posterior angles of the palate are the p)osterior palatine fora- mina, for the palatine nerves and arteries. Passing inwards from these foramina is the transverse ridge, to which are attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor palati muscles ; and at the middle Ime of the posterior border, the 'palate spine, Avhich gives origin to the azygos uvulaj. The hard palate is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four processes of which it is com- posed. Behind, and above the hard palate, are the posterior vares separated hj the vomer, and bounded at each side by the internal pterygoid plates. At the base of the pterygoid plates are the pterygo-palatme canals. The internal pterygoid plate is lono- and narrow, terminated at its apex by the liamular process, and at126 REGIONS OF THE SKULL. Its base hy the scaplioid lossa. The external plate is broad : the space between the two is the pterygoid fossa ; it contains part of the internal pterygoid muscle, and the tensor palati. Externally to the external pterygoid plate is the zygomatic fossa. Behind the nasal fossae, 111 the middle line, is the under surface of the bodv of the sphenoid, and the basilar process of the occipital bone, and still larther back, the foramen magnum. At the base of the external pterygoid plate on each side, is the foramen ovale, and behind thi^ the foramen siomosum with the prominent spine which gives attacli- ment to the long internal lateral ligament of tlie lower jaw and laxator tympani muscle. Eunnmg outwards from the apex of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone is the fissure of Glaser, which crosses Fig. I20.â€”External or basilar surface of the base of the skull, i, i.

Behind the foramen ovale and sj)inosum is the irregular fissure between the sjiinous process of the sphenoid bone and the petrous portion of the temporal, the foramen lacerum basis cranii (called also foramen lacerum medium), which lodges the internal carotid artery, and in which the carotid branch of the Vidian nerve joins the carotid plexus. Following the direction of this fissure outwards, we see the foramen for the Eustachian tube, and that for the tensor tympani muscle, separated from each other by the pro- cessus cochleariforinis. Behind the fissure is the pointed process127 ORBITS. of the petrous bone which gives origin to the levator palati and tensor tynipani nuiscles, and, externally to this process, the carotid foramen for the transmission of the internal carotid artery and ascendincT branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic t and behind the carotid foramen, the jugular foramen and luoular fossa. Externally, and somewhat in front of the latter, is the styloid process, and at its base the vaginal process. Behind and at the foot of the styloid process is the stylo-mastoid foramen, for the facial nerve and stylo-mastoid artery, and farther outwards the mastoid process. At the inner side of the root of the mastoid process is the digastric fossa ; and a little farther inwards, the occi- pital groove. On the sides of the foramen magnum, and near its anterfor circumference, are the condyles of the occipital bone. In front of each condyle, and piercing its base, is the anterior condylar foramen for the hypoglossal nerve, and directly behind the condyle the irregular fossa in which the posterior condylar foramen is situated. Behind the foramen magnum are the two curved lines of the occipital bone, the spine, and the protuberance, with the rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles. The Face is somewhat oval in contour, uneven in surface, and excavated for the reception of two principal organs of sense, the eye and the nose. It is formed by part of the frontal bone, and by the bones of the face. Superiorly it is bounded by the frontal eminences ; beneath these are the superciliary ridges, converging towards the glabella ; beneath the superciliary ridges are the supraorbital ridges, terminating externally in the external border of the orbit, and internally in the internal border, and presenting towards their inner third the supraorbital notch, for the supraorbital nerve and artery. Beneath the supraorbital ridges are the cavities of the orbits. Beneath the orbits is the bridge of the nose, overarching the anterior nares ; and on each side of the- nares the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, the infraorbital foramen, and still farther outwards the prominence of the malar bone ; at the lower margin of the nares is the nasal si^ine, and beneath it the superior ah'eolar arch, containing the teeth of the upper jaw. Forming the lower boundary of the face is the lower jaw, containing in its alveolar process the lower teeth, and projecting inferiorly to constitute the chin I on each side of the chin is the mental foramen. If a per- pendicular line be drawn from the inner third of the supraorbital I'idge to the inner third of the body of the lower jaw, it will be found to intersect three openings : the supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental, each giving passage to a facial branch of the fifth nerve. ORBITS. The orbits are two quadrilateral hollow cones, situated in the upper part of the face, and intended for the reception of the eye- balls, with their muscles, vessels, and nerves, and the lachrymal128 SPHENO-MAXJLLARY FOSSA. glands. The central axis of eacli orbit is directed outwards, so that the axes of the two, continued into the skull through the optic foramina, would intersect over the middle of the sella turcica. The superior houndary of the orbit is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and part of the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; the inferior by part of the malar bone, superior maxillary, and orbital plate of the palate bone ; the ii( terncd, by the nasal process of the superior maxillary, lachrymal, os planum of the ethmoid, and part of the body of the sphenoid ; the external, by the orbital process of the malar bone and great wing of the sphenoid. These may be expressed more clearly in a tabular form :â€” Frontal. Sphenoid (lesser wing). Outer wall. Malar. Sphenoid (greater wing) Inner wall. Superior maxilla (nasal process). Lachrymal. Ethmoid (os planum). Sphenoid (body). Malar. Superior Maxillary. Palate. There are niae openings communicating with the orbit : the optic, for the admission of the optic nerve and oijhthalmic artery; the sphenoidal fisstire, for the transmission of the third, fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, the sixth nerve, and the ophthalmic vein ; the spheno-viaxillary fissure, for the jjassage of the superior maxillary nerve and infraorbital artery to the opening of entrance of the infraorbital canal; temporo-malar foramina, two or three small openings in the orbital process of the malar bone, for the passage of filaments of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve; anterior and j^osterior internal orbital foramina in the suture between the os planum and frontal bone, the former transmitting the nasal nerve and anterior ethmoidal vessels, the latter the posteiior ethmoidal vessels; the opening of the nasal duct; and the supraorbital notch or foramen, for the supraorbital nerve and artery. SPHENO MAXILLARY FOSSA. This is a small space situated between the bones of the head and those of the face ; it corresponds in position to the junction of the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary fissures. It is triangular in form, and is bounded above by the body of the sphenoid and orbital process of the palate, in front "by the superior maxillary, behind by the base of the pterygoid plate and lower part of the anterior surfaceNASAL FOSS^. 129 of the great wing of the sphenoid, internally hj the vertical plate of the palate ; it is wide above, near the base of the skull, but narrow below, where it is continued into the upper part of the descending palatine canal. The fossa has opening into it three fissures and five foramina : the former are the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary, and pterygo-maxillary; the latter are the foramen rotunduni. Vidian, descending palatine, pterygo-palatine, and spheno-palatine. The foramen rotundum, Vidian, and pterygo-palatine foramina are on the posterior wall, being placed in the order of their enumeration from above downwards ; the spheno-palatine is on the inner wall, and the descending palatine below. The fossa lodges Meckel's ganglion, the superior maxillary nerve, and the third part of the internal maxillary artery ; and the foramina which open into it (with the excejjtion of the foramen rotundum) give passage to nerve- twigs derived from the ganglion and small branches of the artery. The nasal fossae are two irregular cavities, situated in the middle of the face, and extending from before back-wards. They are bounded above by the nasal spine of the frontal, nasal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and sphenoidal turbinated bones; beloiv by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones ; externally by the superior maxillary, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, superior and middle tur- binated bones of the ethmoid, palate, and internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid ; and the two fossae are separated by the vomer and perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid. The inner wall presents a large triangular notch anteriorly, which in the recent state is filled in by the cartilage of the septum. These may be more clearly ex- pressed in a tabular form :â€” NASAL FOSS^. Frontal (nasal spine). Nasal bones.5 Ethmoid. Sphenoid. Sphenoidal turbinated bones. C3 Nasal fossa.

Each nasal fossa is divided into three irregular longitudinal pas- sages, or meatuses, by three processes of Ijone, wliich ])roject from its outer wallâ€”the superior, middle, and inferior turbinated hone ; the superior and middle turbinated bone being processes of the ethmoid ; the inferior, a distinct bone of the face. The superior meatus oc- cupies the superior and posterior part of each fossa ; it is situated between the superior and middle turbinated bone, and has o]jening into it two foraminaâ€”viz., foramen of the posterior ethmoidal celLs, and spheno-palatine foramen. The sphenoidal sinuses usually open into the upper part of the nasal fossae, immediately behind tlie superior turbinated bone.

The OS hyoides (lingual bone) gives su2:)port to the tongue, and attachment to numerous muscles in the neck. It is named from its resemblance to the Greek letter v, and consists of a central portion or body, of two larger cornua, which i:)roject backwards from the body ; and two lesser cornua, which ascend from the angle of viiiion between the body and the greater cornua. The body (basi-hyal) is somewhat quadrilateral, rough and convex on its antero-superior surface, by which it gives attachment to muscles; con- cave and smooth on the postero-in- ferior surface, by which it lies in con- tact with the thyro-hyoid membrane. The greater cornua {thyro-hyals) are flattened from above downwards, and terminated posteriorly by a tubercle ; and the lesser cornua (cerato-Iiyals), fig. 122.-The os hyoides seen conical in form, give attachment to fi'om before, i.

It also gives attachment to the stylo- hyoid, thyro-hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments, and to the thvro- hyoid membrane. THE THORAX. The skeleton of the thorax consists of the dorsal vertebra? alreadv described, the sternum, ribs, and costal cartilages. ' STERNUM. The sternum (Fig. 123) is situated in the middle line of the front of the chest, and is oblique in direction, the superior end Ivin? within a few inches of the vertebral column, the inferior beine pro- jected forwards so as to be placed at a considerable distance from the spine. The bone is flat in front, and marked by five transverse lines132 STERNUM. which indicate its original subdivision into six pieces. It is slightly concave behind, broad and thick above, narrowest at the junction of the first and second pieces, and flattened and pointed below ; it is divisible in the adult into three pieces, superior, middle, and inferior, or presternum, mesosternum, and metasternum. The manubriuni (prestermtm) is somewhat triangular in shape ; it is broad and thick above, where it presents a concave border, suprasternal or interclavi- cular notch; and narrow at its junction with the m ddle piece. At each superior angle is a deep articular depression for the clavicle ; and on either side two notches for articulation with the cartilage of the first rib, and one-half that of the second. The junction of the manubrium and body is marked by a transverse ridge, the sternal angle, Avhich serves as a guide to the anterior extremity of the second rib. The body or gladiolus {mesosternum), considerably longer than the superior, is l)road in the middle, and somewhat narrower at each extremity. It presents at each side six articular notches for the lower half of the second rib, the four next ribs, and the upper half of the seventh. The articular notches are placed opposite to the lines which indicate the original sub- division of the bone. This opening of variable size. Fig. 123.â€”Anterior view of the thorax, i. Manubrium. 2.

The ensiform or xiphoid process {metasternum) is the smallest of the three, often merely cartilaginous, and very variable in appear- ance, being sometimes pointed, at otlier times broad and thin, and at other times, again, perforated by a round hole, or bifid. It pre- sents a notch at each side for articulation with the lower half of the cartilage of the seventh rilx r Development. â€” The sternum is usually developed from six. centres, one for each of the segments of which the bone primarilyRIBS. consists. Ossification commences in the manubrium towards the end of the sixth month of foetal life, in the second segment about the seventh or eighth month, in the third and fourth about the time of birth, and in the fifth segment during the first year. The osseous centre for the ensiform cartilage is very variable in its advent, being first apparent at any period from the sixth to the fifteenth year, or even later. Frequently, additional nuclei appear in several of the segments, this being more especially the case with the manubrium, in which as many as six centres have occasionally been oljserved ; in the third, fourth, and fifth segments there are frequently two centres which are jilaced laterally, and it is the irregular union of these pairs that gi-\'es rise to the foramina occasionally seen in the sternum towards its lower part. Union of the pieces of the sternum commences from below and proceeds upwards ; the fifth piece unites with the fourth at about puberty, the fourth and third betAveen twenty and twenty-five, the third and second between twenty-five and thirty. The ensiform appendix becomes joined to the body of the sternum at forty or fifty years ; and the manuljrium to the liody only in very old age. Two small pisiform pieces have been described by Beclard and Breschet, as being situated uj^on and somewhat be- hind each extremity of the supra-sternal notch of the upper border of the manubrium.

The ribs are twelve in number at each side ; the first seven are connected with the sternum by the costal cartilage, and are thence named sternal or true ribs ; the remaining five are the asternal ox- false ribs ; and the last two, shorter than the rest, and free at their extremities, are the floating ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the eighth, wlience they diminish to the twelfth ; in breadth they diminish gradually from the first to the last, and, with the exception of the last two, are broader at the anterior than at the posterior end. The first rib is horizontal in direction ; all the rest are oblique, the anterior extremity falling considerably below the posterior. Each ril) presents an external and internal surface, a superior and inferior border, and two extremities ; it is curved to correspond with the arch of the thorax, and twisted, so that, when laid on a horizontal surface, one end is tilted up. The external surface is convex, and marked by the attachment134 KIBS. of muscles ; Ihe internal is ilat, and corresponds witli the pleura â€¢ the siipenor border is rounded. The inferior border is sharp and grooved on its inner edge, the lower edge of the groove giving attachment to the external, and the upper edge to the internal intercostal muscle. Near its vei'tebral extremity, the rib is some- what bent; and opposite the bend, on the external surface, is a rough oblique ndge, which gives attachment to a tendon of the sacro- lumbahs muscle, and is called the angle. The distance between the vertebral extremity and the angle increases gradually from the second to the eleventh rib. Beyond the angle is a rough elevation, the tubercle, to which the posterior costo-transverse ligament is at- tached ; and immediately at the base and under side of the tubercle a smooth surface for articulation with the extremity of the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra. The vertebral end of the vih is somewhat expanded, and termed the head, and that portion be- tween the head and tubercle, the neck. On the extremity of the head is an oval smooth surface divided by a transverse ridge into two facets for articulation with two contiguous vertebra?; the ridge being joined to the intervertebral substance by means of an inter- Fiu. 124.â€”Vertebral extrem- ity of tlieseYeiithribof tlie right side. i.

The posterior surface of the neck is rough, for the attachment of the middle costo-transverse ligament; and upon its upper border is a crest, which gives attachment to the anterior costo-transverse ligament. The sternal extremity is flattened, and presents an oval depression for the reception of the costal cartilage. The ribs that demand esjjecial consideration are the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first is the shortest rib ; it is broad and fiat, and placed horizontally at the upper part of the thorax, the surfaces looking upwards and downwards, in place of forwards and backwards as in the other ribs. At about the anterior third of the upper surface of the bone, and near its internal border, is a tubercle {scalene tubercle), which gives attachment to the scalenus anticus muscle, and imme- diately before and behind that tubercle, a shallow oblique groove, the former for the subclavian vein, the latter for the subclavian artery. Near the posterior- extremity of the bone is a thick and prominent tubercle, with a smooth articular surface for the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra ; and between the tubercle and the groove for the subclavian artery is a depression for the attach-135 RIBS AND COSTAL CARTILAGES. ment of the scalenus medius nmscle. There is no angle, and no groove on the under side. Beyond the tubercle is a narrow con- stricted neck ; and at the extremity, a head, presenting a single ar- ticular surface. The second rib, in some of its characters, resembles the first, being flattened from above do^vnwa^ds, and only slightly t^visted ; it presents near the middle a rough surface for the attachment of the second and third di"itations of the ser- Fig. 125.â€”First rib of left side.

The eleventh and twelfth have each a single articular surface on the head, no neck or tubercle, and are pointed at the free extremity. The eleventh has a slight ridge, representing the angle, and a shallow groove on the lower border ; the twelfth has neither. Development.â€”The ribs are developed by three centres ; one for the central part, one for the head, and one for the tubercle. The last two liave no centre for the tnbercle. Ossification commences in the body somewhat before its appearance in the vertebrae ; the epi- physeal centres for the head and tubercle appear between sixteen and twenty, and are consolidated with the rest of the bone at twenty- five. Articulations.â€”Each rib articulates with tAvo vertebrae and one costal cartilage, with the exception of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, which articulate each with a, single vertebra only. Attachment of Muscles.â€”Intercostal muscles, scalenus anticus, medius, and jiosticus, pectoralis minor, serratus magnxis, obliquus externus, latissimus dorsi, quadratus lumborum, serratus i^osticus superior, serratus posticus inferior, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi cervicalis ascendens, levatores costarum, transversalis, and dia- phragm. COSTAL CARTILAGES.â€”The costal cartilages serve to prolong the ribs foi-ward to the anterior part of the chest, and contribute mainly to the elasticity of the thorax. They are broad at their attachment with the ribs, and taper slightly towards the sternal end ; tliev diminish gradually in breadth from the first to the last ; in length they increase from the first to the seventh, and then decrease to the last. The cartilages of the first two ribs are horizontal in direc- tion ; the rest incline more and more upwards. In advanced age136 THE THORAX. the costal cartilages are converted more or le.ss completely into bone, the change taking place earlier in the male than in the female. The first seven cartilages articulate with the sternum ; the three next, with the lower border of the cartilage immediately preceding ; the last two lie free between the abdominal muscles. All the car- tilages of the false ribs terminate by pointed extremities. Attachment of Muscles.â€”Subclavius, sterno-tliyroid, pectoralis major, internal oblique, rectus, transversalis, diaphrfxgm, triangu- laris sterni, internal intercostals. THE THORAX AS A WHOLE. The thorax is conical in shape, flattened antero-posteriorly, and wider from side to side than from before l)ackwards. It is formed posteriorly by the dorsal vertebras, and ribs, the bodies of the former projecting into the cavity, and the latter forming a iDackward con- vexity on each side, the furrow between the back of the ribs and the spinous processes of the vertebrse being occupied in the recent state by the dorsal muscles. The anterior wall, formed by the sternum and costal cartilages, inclines forwards as it descends, and at its lower end is a depression corresponding to the xiphoid cartilage. The upper edge of the sternum corresponds to the level of the lower part of the body of the second dorsal vertebra in the male, and in the female to the lower part of the body of the third. Tlie female thorax is relatively shorter and rounder than tlie male, and is also relatively wider in its ujiper part. The lower pai't of the thoracic wall encloses the upjDer part of the abdominal cavity. THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The upper extremity is formed by the cla^'icle, scapvda, humerus, radius, ulna, carpus, metacarpus and phalanges. The clavicle and scapula form the shoulder-girdle. CLAVICLE. The clavicle {clavis, a key), or collar-bone, is a long bone, shaped like the italic letter /, and extended aci'oss tlie upper part of the side of the chest from the upper piece of the sternum to the point of the shoulder, where it articulates with the scapula. The curves are so disposed that at the sternal end the convexity, and at the scapular the cbncavitv, is directed forwards. The sternal half of the bone is rounded, ancl terminates in a broad facet for articulation vntli the sternum ; this facet is continued for a short distance on to the under surface, where it articulates with the cartilage of the first rib. ThePLATE 7.137 CLAVICLE AND SCAPULA. scapular half is flattened from above downwards, and broad at its extremity, the articular surface for the acromion occupying only part of its extent. The upper surface is smooth, convex, and partly subcutaneous ; the under surface rough at its outer part, and ex- cavated into a smooth groove in the middle, where it lodges the subclavius muscle. At the sternal extremity of the under surface is a very rough j)rominence, which gives attachment to the rhomboid ligament; and at the other extremity a rough tubercle near the posterior border, for the conoid ligament, and a ridge, running Fig. 126.â€”Clavicle of the right side ; its upper and anterior face. i.

SCAPULA. The scapula (a-KaTrdvrj, a spade) is a flat triangular bone, situated on the posterior aspect and side of the thorax, and occupving the space from the second to the seventh rib. It is divisible "into an anterior and posterior surface; superior, inferior, and posterior border ; anterior, superior, and inferior angle ; and processes. The anterior surface, or venter, is concave and uneven, forming the subscapular fossa, and is marked by several oblique ridges which have a direction upwards and outwards. It is occupied by the subscapularis muscle, with the exception of the posterior border, a triangular surface near the superior angle, and similar area near the mferior angle, these parts giving attachment to the serratus magnus. Ihe posterior surface, or dorsum, is convex, and unequallv divided into two portions by the spine : that portion above the spine is the supra-spinous fossa ; and that below, the infra-spinous fossa.138 SCAPULA. The superior border is the shortest of the tliree ; it is thin and concave, tenuinated at one extremity by the superior angle, and at the other by the coracoid process. At the base of tlfe coracoid process IS tlie ^npra-scapular or coraco-scaimlar notdi (converted into a foramen by a ligament), for the transmission of the supra- sca]mlar nei've. ' The inferior or axillary border is thick, and marked hy several grooves and depressions ; it terminates siiperiorlv at the glenoid cavity and interiorly at the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough ridge, which gives origin to the long head ot the triceps muscle.

The posterior border or base, the longest of the three, is turned towards the vertebral column. It is intermediate in thickness between the superior and inferior, and convex. Attached to it are three muscles, the levator anguli scapulae extending from the ujiper edge of the triangular area at the root of the spine to the suijerior angle, the rliomboideus minor corresponding in its attachment to the triangular area, and the rliomboideus major attached to the rest of the border. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms the head of the scapula ; it is immediately surrounded by a con- stricted portion, the ncclc. The head presents a .shallow pyriform articular surface, the glenoid cavity, luu-ing the pointed extremity upwards ; and at its apex is a rough depression, which gives attach-PLATE 8.139 SCAPULA. ment to the long tendon of the biceps. At the anterior and upper part of the glenoid cavity a rudimentary notch is observed in its margin ; this is interesting as corresponding to the notch at the inner side of the acetabulum. The superior angle is thin and pointed. The inferior angle is thick, and smooth upon the posterior surface for the origin of the teres major, and for a large bursa over which the ujij^er border of the latissimus dorsi muscle j^lays ; it also occa- sionally gives origin to a few fibres of the latter muscle. The spine of the scapula, triangular in form, crosses the upper part of the dorsum of the bone ; it commences at the posterior border hy a smooth triangular surface over which the fan-shaped tendon of the trapezius glides, and terminates at the point of the shoulder in the acromion ])rocess. At a short distance from its origin, where the tri- angular surface rises to the level of the sj)ine, is a prominent tubercle, which marks the ter- mination of the line of attach- ment of the tendon of the trapezius. The anterior border of the spine is smooth and concave, it arises near the neck of the scapula, and is continued into the under surface of the acromion; it encloses a notch, the great scapular notch, between it and the glenoid cavity. The free border of the spine is rough and subcutaneous, and gives at- tachment, by two projecting lips, to the trapezius above and deltoid Ijelow ; the surfaces of the spine enter into the formation of the supra- and infra - spinous fossa. The nutrient foramina of the scapula are situated in the base of the spine. The acromion, somewhat tri- angular in form, is flattened from above downwards; it over- hangs the glenoid cavity, the upper surface being rough and subcutaneous the lower smooth.

It is about two inches in length, very .strong, and give.s attachment by its tip to the biceps and coraco-braclnahs muscles, by its anterior border to the pectoralis minor, and by its posterior border to the coraco-acromial liga- ment. Near its base is a rough impression for the conoid ligament, and running forwards from this an oblique ridge for the trapezoid ligament. Development.â€”By seven centres ; one for the body (including the spine), two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the inferior angle, and one for the posterior border. The o.ssific centre for the body appears near the head about the seventh or eighth week, one for the coracoid process during the first year, and a second at the base of the same process in the tenth year ; the acromion process at puberty ; the inferior angle in the fifteenth vear; and tlie posterior border at seventeen or eighteen. Union betAveen the coracoid process and body takes place during the fifteenth year; the bone is not complete till after the twenty-second year. Articulations.â€”With the clavicle and humerus.

The liga- ments attached to the coracoid process are, coraco-acromial, coraco- clavicular, coraco-humeral, and the costo-coracoid membrane. HUMERUS. The humerus is divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity presents a rounded luad; a constriction immediately around the base of the head, the anatomical neck; a greater and a lesser tuberosity. The greater tuberosity is situated most externally, and is marked Ijy three facets for the insertion of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor muscles. The lesser tuberosity, placed internally, gives attachment to the tendon of the subscapularis. The tuberosities are separated by a vertical furrow, the bicipital groove, which lodges the long tendon of the biceps, and a branch of the anterior circumflex artery. The edges of this groove below the head of the bone are prominent and rough, and called the external and internal bicipital ridges; the former serves for the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle, the later for the tendon of the teres major ; at the bottom of the groove the tendon of the latissimus dorsi is inserted. The constriction of the bone below the tuberosities is the surgicalHUMERUS. 141 neck and is so named, in contradistinction to the anatomical neck, hom being the seat of the accident called by surgical writers fracture of the neck of the humerus. The shaft of the bone is somewhat cylindrical at its uppei part, and flattened from before backwards below. On the outer side at about its middle, is a rough triangular eminence (deltoid tuberosity), Fir. 129. Fig. 130. < i Fig. 129.â€”Humerusoftherightarm jit.s anterior surface, i. Sliaft of the bone. 2.

On the inner side of the middle of the shaft is a smooth surface for the attachment of the coraco- brachialis muscle ; and behind, an oblique and shallow groove (musculo-spiral groove), which lodges the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The foramen for the medullary vessels is situated on the inner surface of the shaft of the bone a little below tlie coraco-brachial impression ; it is directed downwards. The lower extremity is flattened behind and convex in front; it is terminated inferiorly by a long articular surface, divided into two parts by an elevated ridge. The external portion of the articularHUMERUS. 142 surface is a rounded protuberance, capitellum or eminentia cafitata, whicli articulates witli the cup-shapetl depression on the head of the radius ; tlie internal portion is a concave and pulley-like surface, trochlea, for articulation with the ulna. It will be noticed that the capitellum is limited to the anterior and lower aspect of the bone, and is not seen from behind, while the t)-ochlear surface is even more marked behind than in front; the latter is bounded on its inner side by a salient ridge. Projecting beyond the articular surface at each side are the external and interyial epicondyle, the latter being consider- ably the longer ; and running upwards from the epicondyles along the borders of the bone are the supracondylar ridges, of which the external is the most prominent. Immediately in front of the troch- lea is a small depression for receiving the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the fore-arm {coronoid fossa); and immedi- ately behind it a large and deep fossa, for containing the olecranon process during extension (oleci aiion fossa) ; above the trochlea is a small pit (radial fossa), which receives the anterior part of the head of the radius in complete flexion. The average length of the humerus is, in the male thirteen inches, and in the female twelve inches. Development.â€”By seven centres ; one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the tuberosities, one for the eminentia capitata, one for the trochlea, and one for each epicondyle, the internal preceding the external. Ossification commences in the shaft of the humerus in the eighth week ; in the head during the first year, and in the tubero- sities during the third year ; in the eminentia capitata and trochlea during the third and eleventh year ; and in the epicondyles during the fifth and fifteenth. At the time of birth the shaft is ossified, but the extremities are cartilaginous ; the centre for the head and that for the tuberosities unite during the fifth year. The entire bone is consolidated at twenty. Articulations.â€”With the glenoid cavity of the scai:)ula, the ulna, and radius.

ULNA. The iihia is divisible into a Â§haft and two extremities. The upper extremity is large, and forms principally the articu ation ot the elbow â€¢ the lower extremity is small, and is excluded trom the wrist-jrant by an interarticular fibrocartilage. The upper extremity presents a semilunar concavity of large size, the areater sigmoid notch, for articulation with the humerus ; and on the outer side a lesser sigmoid notch, for the head of the radius. Bounding the greater sigmoid notch posteriorly is the olecranon pro- cess, and overhanging it in front, a pointed eminence with a rough triangular base, the coronoid process. The olecranon process (coXeV?/, elbow ; Kpdvov, head) terminates in front by a sharp beak, which in full extension passes into the olecranon fossa on the humerus ; behind this is a rough and prominent surface or tuberosity for the attach- ment of the triceps muscle ; and on the posterior aspect of the process a smooth triangu- lar area which is sul^cutaneous. The coronoid process has also a sharp beak in front, and below this a triangular, rough surface {tuberosity of the ulna) for the brachialis anticus, immediately to the inner side of which one head of the pronator radii teres is attached. Below the lesser sigmoid notch is a rough pit, which gives attachment to some fibres of the supinator Ijrevis. The shaft is prismoid in form, and presents three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and internal ; and three borders. The anterior surface is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum for the upper three-fourths of its extent; and below, by a depression for the pro- nator quadratus muscle. A little above its middle is the nutrient foramen, directed upwards. On the posterior surface, at the upper part of the bone, is the triangular uneven depression for the anconeus muscle, bounded inferiorly by an oblique ridge which runs downwards from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid notch. Below the ridge, the surface is marked into several grooves for the attachment of the extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, extensoi' secundi internodii pollicis, and extensor indicis muscles.

Tlie posterior is prominent, and aflbrds attacliment to the tendinous ex- pansion common to tlie llexor carpi ulnaiis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and flexor profundus digitorum ; expanding at tlie upper extremity into the triangular subcutaneous surface of the olecranon. The external or radial border is sharp and prominent, for the attach- ment of the interosseous membrane. The lower extremity tei^niiuates in a small rounded head, capi- hdum ulna;, fi'om the side of wliich projects the styloid process. The latter j^resents a deep notch at its base for the attachment of the apex of the triangular interarticular cartilage, and by its point gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament. On tlie posterior sur- face of the head is a groove, for the tendon of the extensor carpi nlnaris ; and on the side opposite the styloid process a smooth sur- face, for articulation -with the side of the radius. Development.â€”By three centres; one for the shaft, one for the inferior extremity, and one for the tip of the olecranon. Ossification commences in the ulna during the eighth week ; the ends of the torum, flexor carpi ulnaris, pronator quadratus, supinator brevis, anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor ossis metiicai'iji pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and extensor indicis. Toone are cartilaginous at l:)irth. The centre for the lower end aijj)ears at about the fifth, that for the tip of the olecranon about the tenth, year. The upper epij)liysis joins the shaft about the six- teenth year, and the lower epiphysis joins about the twentieth.

The upper extremity presents a rounded liead, depressed on its upper surface into a shallow cup for articulation with the capitellum of the humerus. Around the margin of the head is a smooth articular surface which is broad on the inner side, where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna, and narrow in the rest of its circumference, to play in the orbicular ligament. Beneath the head is a constricted circular nech; and beneath the neck, on its inter- nal aspect, a prominent process, the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is partly smooth and partly rough : rough behind, where it receives the attachment of the tendon of the biceps ; and smooth in front, where a bursa is interposed between the tendon and the bone. The shaft of the bone is prismoid, and presents three surfaces. The anterior surface is somewhat concave superiorly, where it lodges the flexor longus poUicis ; and flat below, where it supports the pronator quadratus. At about the uj)per third of this surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed upwards. The posterior surface is round above, where it sujjports the supinator brevis muscle, and marked below by several shallow oblique grooves, which aftbrd attachment to the extensor muscles of the thumb. The external sur- face is round and convex, and marked in its middle by a rongli impression for the insertion of the pronator radii teres ; it is separated from tlie anterior surface below by a rounded border, and above by a distinct ridge which runs forwards on to the anterior surface of the bone, and terminates in the lower part of the tuberosity ; this is called the oblique ridge, and gives attachment to the flexor sublimis digitorum. On the inner margin is a sharp and prominent crest, which gives attachment to the interosseous membrane. The lower extremity of the radius is broad and triangular, and provided with two articular surfaces ; one at the side of the l)one, which is concave to receive the rounded head of the ulna ; the other at the extremity, and marked by a slight ridge into two facets, ome external and triangular^ corresponding with the scaphoid ; the other square, with the semilunar bone. At the outer side of the extremity is a strong conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attacli- ment by its base to the tendon of the supinator longus, and by its apex to tlie external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint. The inner edge of the terminal articular surface affords attachment to the base of the triangular interarticular fibro-cartilage of the wrist-joint. Immediately in front of the styloid process is a groove, which lodges the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and ex-;CAKPUS. 146 tensor pniui mternodii; and, behind the pr<jce8s, a broader groove, fre(iuently divided by a slight ridge, for the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and ])i-evior ; Ijehind this is a i)roniinent ridge, and a deep nariow groove, for the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis ; and internal to this, another broad groove for the tendons of the extensor coninmnis digitorum, and extensor indicis: the ex- tensor minimi digiti running in a groove at the point of arti- culation of the radius and ulna. Development.â€”By three cen- tres ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossifica- tion commences in the shaft soon after the humerus, and before the ulna. The inferior centre appears during the second year, the superior about the fifth. The upper epiphysis unites about puberty, the lower about the age of twenty. Articulations.â€”With four bones: humerus, ulna, scaphoid, and semilunar. Attachment of Muscles.â€” To nine : by the tuberosity to the biceps ; by the oblique ridge, supinator brevis, flexor sublimis dicjitorum ; by the anterior sur- FiG. 133.â€”Grooves at the back of tlie radius and ulna. i.

CARPUS. The bones of the carpus are eight in number, arranged in two rows, consisting of four bones each : those of the jiroximal row, enumerating from the radial side, are the scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform ; those of the distal row, in the same order, are the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform. With the exception of the semilunar, they all have the dorsal surface broad and convex, and the palmar contracted ; the semilunar differs from the rest, in that its dorsal surface is narrow and flattenedPLATE 11. Groove for ext. ossis, metan. poll., and ext. prinii inter- nod, poll.f ICARPUS. and its palmar surface broad and convex. The proximal articulating surface is usually convex, and the distal concave. SCAPHOID.â€”This bone is named from bearing some slight resem- blance to the shape of a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite ; concave on one side, and convex on the other. If carefully examined, it will be found to present proxi- mally a large convex articular surface, which fits into the outer part of the cupped extremity of the radius ; distally it is bluntly pointed, and has two smooth surfaces, divided by a slight ridge, for articula- tion, the outer with the trapezium, and the inner with the trapezoid. Its internal (ulnar) surface is concave, and presents two articular facets, one shallow and crescentic for the semilunar, the other circu- lar and deeply excavated for receiving the head of the os magnum. The proximal portion of the palmar surface is depressed and concave ; the distal portion is raised above the level of the rest of the bone, forming a marked prominence called the tubercle, to which the an- terior annular ligament is attached. The dorsal surface is convex from side to side, contracted from above downwards, and grooved for the attachment of ligaments. The external surface is narrow, non-articular, and rough for the attachment of fibres of the external lateral ligament. Recognition.*â€”To ascertain the hand to which the bone belongs : â€”^liold it with the tubercle upwards, and the smooth, convex, proxi- mal surface directed backwards ; the narrow, non-articular, external surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.â€”With five bones : radius, semilunar, trapezium, trapezoid, and os magnum. Attachment of Muscles.â€”No muscles are attached directly to this bone. SEMILUNAR.â€”This bone may be known by its crescentic figure. The dorsal surface is narrow and flat, the palmar broad and rounded. The other surfaces are all articular ; they are as follows :â€” The proximal, large and convex, occupies the second depression on the inferior articulating surface of the radius ; the distal, concave, articulates with the head of the os magnum ; the external, crescentic, corresponds with a like surface on the scaphoid ; and the internal, nearly circular, articulates with the cuneiform, and by a small bevelled edge with the unciform. Sometimes it articulates also with the unciform, in which case the last-named articulating sur- face is divided into two parts by a slight ridge. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held with the broad palmar sur- face upwards, and the convex proximal articulating surface directed backwards, the crescentic articular facet will point to the appro- priate hand. * In referring each bone to its appropriate baud the same system is to be followed throughout the series ; it consists in placing the bone in the position it occupies in the hand, namely with the narrow palmar surface upwards, and the proximal surface (usually convex) lookmg backwards; the outer surface then point^ to the side to which the Done belongs.148 CARPUS. Articulations.â€”With jive bones : radius, scaphoid, os magnum, cuneiform, and unciform. Attachment of Muscles.â€”No muscles are attached to this bone. CUNEIFORM OR PYRAMIDAL.â€”This bone may be best dis- tinguished by an oval isolated facet, which articulates with the pisiform bone. Its palmar sur- face is narrow and rough ex- ternally for the attachment of ligaments ; internally it presents the characteristic facet for the pisiform just referred to. The dorsal surface is broad and rough for ligamentous attach- ment. The distal end of the cuneiform bone has a broad smooth surface for articulation with the unci- form ; the proximal surface is partly rough for the attachment of ligaments, and ])artly smooth for articulation with the trian- gular fibrocartilage. The oiiter side is marked l)y a circular facet corresjjonding to the one on the inner side of the semi- lunar ; the iK^ter surface is rough, and gives attachment to the in- ternal lateral ligament of the wrist. Recognition.â€”Hold the l)one with the pisiform articular facet upwards, and the broad articular surface directed forwards; the circular articular facet for the semilunar will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.â€”With three bones : semilunar, pisiform, and unciform; and with the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist- joint. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To none. PISIFORM.â€”This bone may be recognised hy its small size, and by the possession of only one articular facet. Examined carefully, it will be observed to present four vside.s and two extremities ; one side is articular, the smooth facet approaching nearer to the proximal than to the distal extremity. The side opposite to this is rounded ; the remaining sides are, one slightly concave, the other slightly convex. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held with the articular surface directed downwards, and the overhanging portion pointing forwards.

Attachment of Muscles.â€”To two : flexor carpi ulnans, and abductor minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament, TRAPEZIUM.â€”This bone may be distinguished by a deep groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle, and by the saddle- shaped distal articular facet. Its 'palmar surface is marked by this f^roove and by a prominent tubercle which overhangs it, which gives attachment to the abductor, flexor brevis, and flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis muscles, and to the anterior annular ligament. The proximal extremity of the trapezium has a facet for articulation with the scaphoid, and its distal extremity one of large size, concave from side to side, convex from above downwards, for articulation with the metacarpal'bone of the thumb. Internally it presents two articular facetsâ€”the upper, large and concave, for the trapezoid ; the lower, small and flat, for the extremity of the second metacarpal bone.

TEAPEZOID.â€”This bone is small, oblong, quadrilateral, and bent near its middle. Its dorsal surface is wide and convex, its palmar very narrow and flattened. It has four articular surfaces sepa- rated by slight ridges ; the proximal of these is quadrilateral, and articulates with the scaphoid ; the distal one is saddle-shaped for the second metacai'pal bone ; the internal surface is smooth and concave for the os magnum, and the external is convex for the trapezium. Recognition.â€”Hold the bone with the narrow free surface up- wards, and the saddle-shaped surface looking forwards ; the convex articular surface will point to the appropriate hand. Articulations.â€”With four bones : trapezium, os magnum, sca- phoid, and second metacarpal. Attachment of Muscles.â€”Part of the flexor brevis poUicis. OS MAGNUM.â€”This is the largest bone of the carpus ; it is divisible into a head or proximal, and a body or distal extremity. The rounded head articulates by its proximal and external surfaces with the semilunar and scaphoid l)ones. Its palmar and dorsal sur- faces are Ijoth roiTgh; the latter l)eing square and flat, the formej" I'ounded and prominent. Its distal extremity is divided into three small facets for articulation with the second, third, and foi;rth metacarpal bones ; its internal surface is rough distally for an interosseous ligament, smooth ])roximally for articulation ^\'ith the unciform. By its external surface it articulates by means of a small facet with the trapezoid, and proximal to this facet is a rough space for another interosseous ligament. The proximal articular surface encroaches on the external surface but not on the internal, so that the formei' is easily identified by this j^eculiarity. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held with the flat and rougli dorsal surface downwards, and the liead directed backwards, the side of the head on to which the proximal articular facet is continued will point to the appropri- ate hand.

UNCIFORM.â€”This is a triangular-shaped bone, remarkable for a long and curved process, which projects from its palmar aspect. The palmar surface is free, and is distinguished by the hooked process just mentioned ; the dorsal surface is broad and rough. Its distal extremity presents a double articular surface for the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones ; its proximal extremity is convex for articulation with the semilunar ; externally it has two facets, with an intervening rouo-h space, these being for articulation with the os magnum ; and intnnalli/ it has an oblong smooth facet for the cuneiform, and below this a rough edge for attachment of ligaments. Eecognition.â€”If the bone be held with the uncinate process upwards, and the double facet forwards, the two small articular surfaces, with the intervening rough portion, will point to the ap- propriate hand. Articulation.â€”With five bones : semilunar, os magnum, cunei- form, and fourth and fifth metacarpals. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To two : flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti and flexor brevis minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament. Development of the Carpus.â€”The bones of the carpus are each developed by a single centre ; they are cartilaginous at birth. Ossi- fication commences towards the end of the first year in the os magnum and unciform ; at the end of the third year, in the cunei- form ; during the fifth year, in the trapezium and semilunar ; during the sixth, in the scaphoid ; eighth, in the trapezoid ; and twelfth, in the pisiform. The latter bone is the last in the skeleton to ossify ; it is, in reality, a sesamoid bone of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The number of articulations which each bone of the carpus main- tains with surrounding bones may be expressed in figures, which will facilitate the student's recollection; the cipher for the first row is 5531, and for the second 4475. METACARPUS. The bones of the metacarpus are five in number. They are long bones, divisible into a head, shaft, and base. The head is rounded at the distal extremity, forming an articular surface which extends farther on the front than on the back of the bone; each lateral aspect presents a small tubercle Avith a pit below it for the attachment of the lateral ligaments of the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint. The shaft is prismoid ; its posterior surface, upon which the extensor tendon lies, is flat; its anterior surface presents a ridge dividing two sloping surfaces for the attachment of the interossei muscles. The base is irregularly quadrilateral, and rough for the insertion of tendons and ligaments ; it presents three articular surfaces : one at each side for adjoining metacarpal bones, and one at the extremity for the carpus.METACARPUS. 152 Tlie metacarpal hone of the thumb is one-third shorter than the rest, flattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and convex on its palmar side ; the articular surface of the head is not so round as that of the other metacarpal bones ; and the base lias a single proximal saddle- shaped surface, to articulate with the corresponding surface of the trapezium. It has no lateral facets. The metacarpal bones of the different fingers may be distinguished by certain special characters. The base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger is the largest of the four, and presents three articular facets at its proximal extremity for the trapeziuin, trapezoid, and os magnum, and one on its ulnar side for the third metacarjjal. It may most readily be identified by its j)roximal articular surface being divided into two, so as to present a notched appearance. That of the middle finfier may be distinguished hj a rounded projecting process at the radial side of its base {styloid process) for the attach- ment of the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevior, and two small circular facets on its ulnar lateral surface. The l)ase of the metacarpal bone of the ring finger is small and squai'e, and has two small circular facets on the radial side to correspond with those of the middle metacarpal, and one on the ulnar side for the metacarpal of the little finger. The nutacarjJal bone of the little finger has only one lateral articular surface, namely, on the radial side. Development.â€”By tioo centres; one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the ejiiphysis of which, like that of the phalanges, occupies the carpal end of the bone. Ossification of the metacarpal bones commences in the embryo during the eighth or ninth week, that is, soon after the bones of the fore-arm. The ejnphyses make their appearance at the end of the second or early in the tliird year, arid the bones are completed at twenty. Articulations.â€”The_/i? s^ with the trapezium ; second, trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and middle metacarpal; third or middle, os magnum, and adjoining metacarpal bones ; fourth, os magnum, unci- form, and adjoining metacai'pal bones ; fifth., unciform, and meta- carpal bone of the ring finger. Each bone also articulates with its appropriate proximal phalanx. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the metacarpal bone of the thumb, three, flexor ossis metacarpi, extensor ossis metacarpi, and first dorsal interosseous ; index finger, six, extensor carpi radialis longior, flexor brevis pollicis, flexor carpi radialis, first and second dorsal and first palmar interosseous ; middle finger, stx, extensor carpi radialis bre- vior, flexor brevis pollicis, flexor carpi radialis, adductor pollicis, second and third dorsal interosseous ; ring finger, three, third and fourth dorsal interosseous, and second palmar ; little finger, four, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti, fourth dorsal and third palmar interosseous.153 PHALANGES. PHALANGES. The phalanges {internodia) are the bones of the fingers ; they are named from their arrangement in rows, and are fourteen in number, three to each finger, and two to the thumb. In each finger the proximal phalanx is the longest, and the distal phalanx the shortest. In conformation they are long bones, di\dsible into a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is compressed from before backw-ards, convex on its posterior surface, and flat with raised edges in front. The meta- carpal extremity or base in the first row is a simple concave articular surface ; that in the other two rows a double concavity, separated by a slight ridge. The dicjital extremities of the first and second row present a pulley-like surface, concave in the middle, and convex at each side. The ungual extremity of the last phalanx is broad, rough, and expanded into a semilunar crest. Development.â€”By two centres ; one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences (during the eighth week) in the third or imgual phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the second. The epiphyses of the first row appear during the third or fourth year, those of the second row during the fourth or fifth, and of the last during the sixth or seventh. The phalanges are perfected Ijy the twentieth year. Articulations.â€”The first row, with the metacarpal bones and second row of phalanges ; the second row, with the first and third ; the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the base of the first phalanx of the thumb fdur muscles, abductor pollicis, flexor brevis pollicis, adduc- tor pollicis, and extensor primi internodii; to the second phalanx, two, flexor longus pollicis, and extensor secundi internodii. To the first phalanx of the second, third, and fourth fingers, one dorsal and one palmar interosseous ; to that of the little finger, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and one palmar interosseous. To the second phalanges, flexor sublimis and extensor communis digi- torum ; to the last phalanges, flexor profundus and extensor communis digitorum. PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY. The bones of the pelvis are the two ossa innominata, the sacrum, and the coccyx, forming the pelvic girdle; and those of the lower ex- tremity, the femur, patella, tibia and fibula, tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges. OS INNOMINATUM. The OS innominatum (as coxce) is an irregular, flat bone, consisting in the young subject of three parts, which meet at the acetabulum. Hence it is described in the adult as divisible into three portions,OS INNOMINATUM. 154 ili um, ischium, und pubes. The ilium is the superior, broad, and expanded portion wliich forms tlie prominence of the hip, and arti- culates with the sacrum. Tlie ischium is the inferior and strong part of the bone on which the body rests in sitting. The pubes is that portion which forms the front of the pelvis, and gives support to the external organs of generation. The Ilium may be described as divisible into an internal and external surface, a crest, and an anterioi' and posterior border. The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, l^elow by a i^rominent line, the pectineal line, and before and behind by the anterior and posterior border. It is concave and smooth for the anterior two-thirds of its extent, and lodges the iliacus muscle. The posterior third is rough, for articulation with the sacrum, and divided by a deep groove into two ])arts ; an anterior or auricular Fig. 137.â€”Os iiinominatum of the right side. i.

The external surface {dorsum of the ilium) is uneven, partly convex, and partly concave : it is bounded above by the crest; below by a prominent arch, which forms the upper margin of the acetabulum ; and, before and behind, by the anterior and posterior border. At the posterior part, a rough line marks off a triangular area which gives attachment to the gluteus maximus ; the line is continued anteriorly into the outer lip of the crest, and is called the superior or posterior curved line. Near the middle of this surface is a second ridge which is called the middle curved line; it commences at about an inch and a half from the anterior extremity of tlie cre.sl, and terminates in the upper part of the greater sacro-ischiatic notch.155 OS INNOMINATUM. Below this is a third ridge called the inferior curved hne, commencing lust above the anterior inferior spine, and terminating at the lower part of the greater sacro-ischiatic notch. The surface included between the superior and middle curved lines gives origin to the gluteus medius muscle ; that between the middle and inferior curved lines, to the Â«^luteus minimus ; and the rough interval between the inferior curved^ line and the arch of the acetabulum, to one head of the The crest of the ilium is arched, and curved in direction like the italic letter /, being bent inwards at its anterior termination, and outwards at the posterior. It is broad for the attachment of three planes of muscle, which are connected with its external and internal border or lip, and with the intermediate space. On its outer lip, at about midway between tlie anterior superior spinous process and the summit of the crest, is a prominent tubercle, from which a strong vid^e runs down to the acetalnilum. This is the broadest part of the*'crest, and the descending ridge serves as a luittress in giving strength to the bone. The anterior border is marked by two prominences, the anterior superior spinous process, which is the anterior termination of the crest, and the anterior inferior spinous process ; the first of these and the space beneath it give attachment to Poupart's ligament and the sartorius muscle, the second to one head of the rectus. This bordei- terminates inferioiiy in the lip of the acetal)ulum. The posterior border also presents two prominences, the 'jwsterior superior and posterior inferior spinous process, separated by a notch ; tlie former gives attaclimeiit to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament, the latter to the greater sacro-ischiatic ligament. Iiiferiorly this border is broad and arched, and forms the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch. The Ischium is divisible into a thick and solid portion, the body, and a thin and ascending part, the ramus ; it may be considered also, for convenience of description, as presenting an external and internal surface, and three borders, posterior, inferior, and superior. The external surface is rough and uneven for the attachment of muscles; and broad and smooth above, where it enters into the formation of tlie acetabulum. Below the inferior lip of the aceta- bulum is a notch which lodges the obturator exteriius muscle in its passage outwai-ds to the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The internal surface is smooth, and somewhat encroached upon at its posterior border by the spine ; it is separated by the pectineal line from tlie concave inner surface of the ilium, and is chiefly occupied by the origin of the ol)turator internus. The posterior border of the ischium presents toAvards its middle a remarkable projection, the spine, which is directed backwards and inwards, and gives origin by its inner surface to two muscles, the coccygeus and levator ani. Immediately above the spine is a notch of large size, tlie great sacro-ischiatic, and below tlie spine, the lesser sacro-ischiatic notch; the former, being converted into a foramen by156 OS INNOMINATUM. the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, gives passage to the gluteal vessels and nerve, ])yrif()rinis muscle, pudic vessels and nerve, and ischiatic vessels and nerves ; the lesser, completed by the greiit sacro-ischiatic ligament, to the ol)turator internus muscle, the nerve which is dis- tributed to it, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. The inferior border is thick and broad, and called the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is divided into two facets ; the upper and outer, for the origin of the semi-membranosus ; and the lower and inner, for the semi-tendinosus and biceps muscles. The inner margin of the tuberosity is bounded by a sharp ridge, which gives attachment to a prolongation of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament; and the outer margin by a prominent ridge, from which the quadratus femoris muscle arises. The superior border of the ischium is thin, and forms the lower circumference of the obturator foramen. The ranms of the ischium is continuous with the ramus of the pubes, and is slightly everted. The PuBBS is divided into a central part or body, a horizontal ramus, and a descending ramus. The external surface of the body is rough for the attachment of muscles ; the internal surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the cavity of the pelvis. The superior border is marked by a rougli ridge, the crest; the inner termination of the crest is the ang/e; the outer end, the spine; the latter gives attachment to the inner end of Poupart's ligament. The inner extremity of the body is the syvi- physis; it is oval and rough for the attachment of the articular cartilage. Punning outwards from the spine is a sharp ridge, the pectineal line, which marks the brim of the true pelvis. The inferior border is broad, deeply grooved for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve, and forms part of the boundary of the obturator foramen. The obiter border of the body is sharp and thin, forming part of the margin of the obturator foramen, and giving attachment to the obturator membrane. The horizontal ramus extends from the body of the pubes to the junction of pubes and ilium ; their point of union is marked by a rounded projection, the ilio-pubic. eminence, which serves to separate the surface for the femoral vessels from another depression wdiich overhangs the acetabulum and lodges the psoas and iliacus muscles. Behind this eminence runs the ilio-piectiueal line, and on its inner side is a triangular area for the attachment of the pectineus muscle. The descending ramus of the pubes passes obliqubliv; outwards, and is continuous with the ramus of the ischium. - The inner border forms with tlie corresponding bone the arch of tke-.puhes, and at its inferior part is everted, to give attachment to the crus penis. The ramus of the ischium and pubes together give attachment by their external sur- face to the adductor longus, brevis, and magnus muscles, the gracilis and obturator externus, and by their internal surface to the com- pressor urethras, erector penis, transversus perinei, obturator internus, and levator ani. . , i i The acetabulum (cotyloid cavity) is a deep cup-shaped cavity,OS INNOMINATUM. !57 situated at the point of union between the ilium, ischium, and pubes; a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a little more than two-fifths by the ischium, the remaining fifth by the pubes. It is bounded by a deep rim or lip, broad and strong above, where most resistance is required, and marked in front by a deep notch, which is arched over in the fresh subject by a strong ligament, and transmits the nutrient vessels of the joint. At the bottom of the cup, and communicating with the notch, is a deep circular pit, which lodges a mass of fat, and gives attachment by its edges to the broad extremity of the ligamentum teres. The obturator or thyroid foramen (also called foramen ovale) is a large oval interval between the ischium and pubes, bounded by a narrow rough margin, to which a ligamentous membrane is attached. The upper part of the foramen is increased in depth by the groove in the under surface of the os pubis, which lodges the obturator vessels and nerve. Development.â€”By eight centres : three principal, one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the pubes; and five secondary, one, the Y-shaped piece, for the interval between the primitive pieces in the bottom of tlie acetabulum, one for the crest of the ilium, one (not constant) for the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ilium, one for the tuberosity of the iscliium, and one (not constant) for the angle of the pubes. Ossification commences in tlie primitive pieces, immediately after that in the vertebras, firstly in the ilium during tlie eighth week, then in the ischium in the third mouth, and lastly in the pubes in the fourth or fifth month ; the first ossific deposits being situated near the future acetabulum. At Inrth, tlie acetalnilum, crest of the ilium, and ramus of the pubes and ischium, are cai'tilaginous. The rami of the ischium and pubes iinite during the eightli year. The epiphyses appear about tlie time ot puberty, that for the Y-shaped cartilage ossifying first; the three parts of the bone unite in the acetabulum at about the seventeenth or eighteenth year, and the bone is completed from the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth year.

The true pelvis is all that portion which is situated below this line, which thus forms the margin or brim of the true pelvis, while the included area is called the inlet. The form of the inlet IS heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front at the symphysis pubis, expanded on each side, and encroached upon behind by a projection of the upper part of the sacrum, which is named the pro- montory. The cavity is somewhat encroached upon at each side bv a smooth quadrangular plane of bone, corresponding with the internal surface of the acetabulum, and prolonged posteriorly into the spine of the ischium. In front are two fossae around the ob- turator foramina, for lodging the obturator internus muscle at each side. The inferior tei'mination of the pelvis is very irregular, and is termed the outlet. It is bounded, in front, by the convergence of the rami of the ischium and pubes, which constitute the arch of the pubes; on eacli side by the tuberosity of the ischium, and two ii'regular fissures formed hj the greater and lesser saci'o-ischiatic notches; and behind by the lateral borders of the sacrum, and the coccyx. . The pelvis is placed obliquely with regard to the trunk of the Ijody, the inner surface of the pulies being directed upwards, and serving to support the weight of the abdominal "\dscera. The base of the sacrum rises nearly four inches above the ],evel of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx somewhat more than half an inch above its lower border. If a line were carried through the central axis of the inlet, it would impinge by one extremity against the iimbilicus, and l)y the other against the middle of the coccyx. The axis of the inlet is, therefore, di- rected wpwarils and forwards, while that of the outlet points downwards and forwards, and corresponds with a line drawn from the upper part of the sacrum, through the centre of the outlet. The axis of the cavity represents a curve, corre- sponding very nearly with the curve of the sacrum, the extremities being indicated by the central points of the inlet and outlet. A knowledge of the direction of these axes is important to the surgeon, as indicating the line in which instruments should be used in opera- tions upon the viscera of the pelvis, and the direction of force in the Fig. 139.â€”Angle of inclination of the brim of the pelvis 144Â° to tlie perpendicular,or 54Â° to the horizontal line.i6o FEMUR, removal of calculi from the blaclder ; and to the accoucheur, as explaining the course taken by the fujtii.s during pai'tui'ition. There are certain characteristic differences between the male and female pelvis. In the male the Ijones ai'e thicker, stronger, and more solid, the cavity being deeper and nai'rower. In the female the bones are lighter and more delicate, the iliac fossa? large, and the ilia expanded ; the inlet, outlet, and cavity are large, and the aceta- bula farther removed from each (jther ; the cavity is shallow, the tuberosities widely separated, the obturator foramina triangular, the sacrum broader and its curvature chiefly limited to the lower end, the coccyx more movable, and the span of the pubic arch greater. The precise diameter of the inlet and outlet, and the depth of the cavity of the female pelvis, are important considerations to the accoucheur. Three diameters are usually described in each part of the true pelvis ; they are : (i) Antero-posterior or conjugate ; (2) Transverse ; and (3) Oblique. The following table shows the comparative measure- ments in the male and female pelvis in inches :â€” Malk. 1 Fema le. Brim. Cavity. Outlet. Brim. Cavity. Outlet.

The femur, the longest bone of the skeleton, is situated obliquely in the ujiper part of the lower limb, articulating by means of its head with the acetabulum, and inclining inwards as it descends, until it abuost meets its fellow of the opposite side at the knee. In the female this obliquity is greater than in the male, in consequence of the great breadth of the pelvis. The femur is divisible into a shaft, a superior, and an inferior extremity. At the upper extremity is a rounded head directed upwards and inwards, and marked just below its centre by an OA^al depression for the ligamentum teres. The head is supported by a neck, which varies in length and obliquity with sex and period of life, being long and oblique in the adult male, shorter and more horizontiil in the female and in old age. Externally to the neck is a large process, the trochanter major, which presents on its anterior surface an oval facet for the attachment of the tendon of the gluteus minimus muscle ; and on its outer surface, an oV)lique line for the insertion of the "-hit'eus medius. On its posterior side is a vertical ridge (quadrate line) ior the attachment of the quadratus femoris muscle. At the inner side of the trochanter major is a deep pit, trochanteric or digital fossa at the bottom of which the obturator externus muscle isPLATE 15. Pyriformis \ Obt. int. andgemelli.

The upper border of the great trochanter gives attachment near its anterior extremity to the gemellus superior, obturator in- ternus, and gemellus inferior muscles, and a little behi'ud this to the pyriformis muscle. Passing downwards from the trochanter major in front of the bone is an oblique ridge, which forms the inferior boundary of the neck, the spiral line, Avhich if traced down- wards will l)e found to lead into the upper part of the linea asj^era ; in well-marked specimens, two snaall tubercles will l)e found on it, one near the great trochanter, and the other lower down ; they are called the external and internal cervical tubercles. Behind there is another oblique ridge, the intertrochanteric line, which terminates in a rounded tubercle on the posterior and inner side of the bone, the trochanter minor, for the insertion of the psoas and iliacus. The shaft of the femur is convex in front, and covered muscles; and somewhat concave and raised into prominent ridge behind, the linea aspera. The linea aspera near the upper extremity of the bone divides into three branches. -^ mm: K â€¢ The anterior branch is con- ITOlfflv'^^^. tinned forwards in front of the 'lesser troclianter, and is con- tinuous with the spiral line; tlie middle is continued directly upwards into the lesser troch- anter ; and the posterior, broad and sti'ongly marked, ascends to the base of the trochanter major. Towards the lower extremit}' of the bone the linea aspera divides into two ridges, which descend to the two condyles, and enclose a triangular ,space upon which rests the popliteal artery. The internal supra- condylar ridge is less marked than the external, and presents a broad and shallow groove for the passage of the femoral artery. The nutrient foramen is situ- ated in or near the linea aspera, at about one-third from its upper extT'emity, and is dii'ected obliquely from below upwards. The outer side of the shaft im- mediately abo\-e the condyles is very much thicker than"the inner side, a point to be borne in mind in division of the femur for the cure of knock-knee. 12 Fio. 140. â€” The right femur, seen on its an- terior as))ect. 1.

The external condyle is tlie l^'oadest and most proniinenf, the internal the nari'owest and hjiigest; the difference in length dej)end- ing on the obliquity of the femur, in conserjuence of tlie se])aration of the two bones at their ujiper extreinity l)y the l)j'eadth of tlie lÂ»elvis. Tlie difference in the length of the condyles has been ascer- tained to amount to about eight millimetres, this" being the average of a hundred observations (H. E. CJlai-k). The external condyle is marked on its outer side by a pronunent tubei-osity, which gives attachment to the external lateral % ligament ; and immediately beneath this is a fossa which lodges the tendon of origin of the popliteus. By the internal surface it gives attachment to the antericn- ci'ucial ligament of the knee-joint ; and by lioi' part, to the the its u])per and externa] head and ])]antaris, dyle ])i'ojects gastrocnemius Fu;. 141.â€”Uiagvaiii of under surface of condyles of femur. of The internal con- on its inner side into a tuberosity, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament; above this tuberosity, at the extremity of the internal supra-condylar i-idge, is a tul)ercle for the insertion of the tendon of the adductor magnus ; and above the posterior surface of the condyle, a depression from Avliich the internal head of the gastrocnemius arises. The outer side of the internal condyle is rough and concave, for the attachment of the ])ostei'ior crucial ligament. The lower articular surface of the femur is divisiljle into three ])arts, the two condylar surfaces, and i\vii)atellar surface ; thelatterismarked oft" from the two former by shallow de])ressions I'unning fi'om the free margins of the ai'ticulation into the iipper ])art of the intercoiidylar notch. In addition to the true condylar surface, the internal condyle has on its anterior face a small oblique surface, interposed between the condylar and patellar surfaces. The patellar or trochlear surface is the anterior jiart of the articular surface; its outer side extends higher up than its inner, and terminates l)y a nioi-e salient edge. Development.â€”By five centres ; one for the shaft, one for each exti'emitv, and one for each trochanter. The femur is the first of the long bones to show signs of ossification ; ossific matter is found immediately after the maxillaj and before the termination of the second month of embryonic life. The secondary deposits take place in the following order : in the condylar extremity diiring the last month of fcetal life ; in the head towards the end of the first year ; in the greater trochanter between the third and fourth year ; in thePLATE 16.PATELLA. 163 lesser trochanter between the thirteenth and fourteenth.

PATELLA. The patella is a sesamoid bone, develojR-d in tlic lendou of tlie ([uadricejts extensor muscle, and iisually descril)ed as a Ijone of tlie lower extremity. It is heart-shaped in figure, the broad end Ijeing dii-ected up-wards, the apex downwards ; the external surface is convex, and the internal divided by a ridge into two smooth surfaces, to articulate with tlie condyles of the femur. Tlie external articular surface, corresponding with the external condyle, is the large)' of the two, and serves to indicate the leg to which the bone Ijelongs. Each surface pre'^ sents a faint transverse line near its lower end, another near its upper border, so as to di\ ide them into three facets ; the internal surface has also a vertical line near its inner edge. To the U]i]ier border of the bone are attached the rectus femoris and crureus muscles, and to the \\\)\m- part of the lateral margins the expanded tendons of the vastus externus and internus, and l)y tlie inferior pointed process it is attached, tlirough means of a strong band called the lirjamentum jHitcllai, to the tubercle of the tibia.

If Tlie tibia is tlie inner and larger bone of the-leg; it is prismoid in form, and divisible into a shaft, an uppei- and lower extremity. The upper extremity, or head, is large, and expanded latei'ally into two tiiherodties. On the n])i)er surface the tu1)erosities are smooth to ai'ticulate with the condyles of the femur ; the intxn-nal articular surface being oval to correspond with the internal condyle ; the external, broad and nearly circular. Between the two articulai' stirfaces is a sinnous p'ociiss; and in front of and l)ehind the s])inous ^ process a rougli depression, giving attachment to the anterior and pos- terior crucial ligament and the two semilunar cartilages. Between the two tul)erosities on the front aspect of the bone is a })rominent ele^'ation, the tubercle for the insertion of the ligamentum patella3, and immediately above the tubei'cle a smooth facet, corresponding ^v[t\l the ljursa of the ligamentum ])atellte.- Posteriorly the tuberosities are separated by a de- pression called the po})liteal notch, Avhich gi\'es attachment to part of the posterior crucial ligament, and part of the posterior ligament of Winslow. Upon the posterior and under part of the external tuberosity is an articular surface for the head of the filnila ; and u])on the })oste- rior part of the internal tuljerosity a depression for the insertion of the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle. The shaft of the tibia presents three surfaces. The internal is con- vex, and is subcutaneous through- out its lower three-fourths; at the upper part, on a line with tlie tubercle of the tibia, it gives attachment to the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi- tendinosus muscles. The external is concave, and is occupied by the tiVtialis anticus muscle ; at its lower third it curves forwards towards the front of the bone, and supports the tendons of the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius hallucis, and extensor communis di"itorum. The fosterior is grooved for the attachment of muscles. Near the upper extremity of the posterior surface is an oblique rid"e, the oblique line (pv soleal ridge), for the attachment of the 3oleus muscle and fascia of the popliteus muscle ; and immediatelyPLATE 17.TIBIA. 165 below the oblique line, tbe nutrient canal, which is directed down- wards. The triangular space above the oblique line is occupied by the popliteus muscle. The borders of the tibia are anterior, internal, and external. The anterior border is sharp and curved outwards in its upper two-thii'ds, and rounded and curved inwards below. It is known as the crest of the tibia, and, poj)ularly, as the shin. The internal border is most prominent in the middle, and is rounded above and below ; it gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and to the soleus and flexor longus digitorum muscles. The external border gives attach- ment throughout its whole length to the interosseous mem- brane, and divides below to enclose a triangular rough .1; space, for the in terosseous ligament between the lower end of til^ia and fibula. The inferior ex- tremity of the bone is somewhat quad- rilateral, and i^ro- longed on its inner side into a large process, the internal mallenlus. The inner siu-face of the malleolus is smooth for articulation witli tlie astragalus; at its tip is a small de- pression for the in- ternal lateral liga- ment of the ankle- .joint. Beliind the internal malleolus is a broad and shaUow groove for lodging the tendons of the tibialis posticus and Hexor longus digitorum ; and fartlier outwards another groove for the tendon ot the flexor longus hallucis.

FIBULA. The fibula {ivepovr}, a brooch, from its I'esemblance, in conjunction with the tibia, to the pin of an ancient l)i'ooch) is tlie outer and smaller bone of the leg; it is long and slender in figure, prismoid in shape, and, like other long bones, divisiWe into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or head is thick and large, and depressed at the upi)er part by a concave surface, which articulates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Externally to this surface is a thick and rough prominence, terminated behind by a styloid process for the attachment of the long external lateral ligament of the knee- joint, and for the insertion of tlie tendon of the biceps. The lower extremity is flattened fi'om without inwards, and prolonged downwards beyond the articular surface of the tibia, forming the external malleolus. Its external side presents a rough and triangular surface, which is subcutaneous. On the internal sur- face is a smooth triangular facet to articulate with the astragalus, and a rough depression for the insertion of the interosseous ligament. Beliind the articular surface and l)etween it and the tip of the mal- leolus is a deej) fossa which lodges the posterior slip of the external lateral ligament. The anterior border is thin and sharp, the posterior broad and grooved for the tendons of the peronei muscles. The shaft of the fibula is prismoid, and jDresents three surfaces ; external, internal, and posterior ; and three borders. The external surface is the broadest of the three; it commences on the anterior part of the bone above, and curves around it so as to terminate on its posterior side below. This surface is completely occupied by the two peronei muscles. The internal surface commences on the side of the superior articular surface, and terminates below by narrowing to a ridge which is continuous with the anterior border of the mal- leolus. It ivS marked along its middle by the interosseous ridge, whichPLATE 18.TARSUS 167 is lost above and below in tlie inner border of the bone, and which gives attacliment to the interosseous membrane. The posterior sur- face is twisted like the external ; it commences above on the posterior side of the bone, and terminates below on its internal side ; at about tlie middle of tins surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed downwards. Tlie internal border commences superiorly in common with the interosseous ridge, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lines, wliicli l)Ound the triangular subcutaneous surface of the external malleolus. The external border Ijegins at the base of the styloid process of the head, and winds around tlie l)one, following the direction of the corresponding surface. The posterior border, sharp and jjrominent, is lost inferiorly in the interosseous ridge. Recognition.â€”In order to I'ecognise whether the bone belongs to the right or left side, it should lie held with the head (known by the styloid process and terminal articular facet) upwards, and the pit at the back of the external malleolus directed towards the observer ; the triangular subcutaneous area will then point to the side to Avhicli the bone l)elongs. Development.â€”By three centres ; one for the shaft, and one foi- each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after its appearance in the tibia ; at birth the extremities are cartilaginous, an osseous deposit taking place in the inferior epiphysis during the second year, and in the superior during the fourth or fifth. The inferior epiphysis is the first to become united -\\dth the diaphysis, Init the bone is not completed until nearly the twenty-fifth year. 'Hie epiphyses of all the long bones except the fibula unite with the diaphysis in the reverse oi-der of their appearance ; but in the fibula, the lower epiphysis, which is the first to appear, is also the first to .join the shaft. Articulations.â€”With the tibia and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To nitie : by the head, to the tendon of the biceps and soleus ; by the s/,aft, its external surface, jieroneus longus and brevis ; internal surface, extensor longus digitorum, ex- tensor proprius hallucis, peroneus tertius, and til)ialis po.sticus ; by the posterior surface, fiexor longus hallucis. The bones of the tarsus are seven in number, viz., astragalus os calcis, scaphoid, internal, middle, and external cuneiform, and cuboid. ASTRAGALUSâ€”The astragalus (os tali) may be recognised by its roundecl liead, a broad articular facet on its convex surface and two articular facets, separated by a deep groove, on its concave suriace. The bone is divisible into a superior and inferior surface, an ex- ternal and internal border, and an anterior and posterior extremity.OS CALCIS. TIxe superior surface is convex, and presents a large quadrilateral and smootli facet, somewhat broader in front than beliind, to articulate witli the tibia. The inferior surface is concave, and divided by a deep and rougli groove (sulcus tali), which lodges a strong interosseous ligament, into two facetsâ€”the posterior large and quadrangular, the anterior smaller and ellipticalâ€”which articulate Avith the os calcis. The internal border, ilat and uneven, is mai-ked by a pyriforni arti- cular surface, limited to the iipper half of this border, for the inner malleolus. The external presents a large triangulai- articular facet, extending the whole depth of the l)order, for the external malleolus, and is rough and concave in front. The anterior extremity presents a rounded head., encircled by a constriction somewhat resem])ling a neck ; the 2^osterior extremity is narrow, and mai'ked by a deep groove for tlie tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. Recognition.^â€”Hold the astragalus with the Ijroad convex ar- ticular sui'face upwards, and rounded head forwards ; the large triangular lateral articular surface will point to the side to which the bone lielongs. Articulations.â€”With four bones : tibia, fibula, os calcis, and scaphoid. OS CALCIS.â€”This bone may be known by its large size and oblong figure, hy tlie massi\'e ])ortion which forms the heel, and by two articular surfaces, separated by a broad groove, upon its upper side. The OS calcis is divisible into four surfaces, superior, inferior, external, and internal; and two extremities, anterior and 1 )Osterior. The superior stirface is convex behind and irregu- larly concave in front, where it jiresents two and sometimes tliree articular facets, diA'ided by a broad and shallow groove (sulcus calcanei), for the inter- osseous ligament. Theinferior .mrface is convex and rough, and l:)ounded posteriorly by the two inferior tuberosities, of which the internal is broad and large, the external smaller and prominent. The external surface is convex and subcu- taneous, and is often marked towards its anterior third by two grooves, separated by a tubercle, for the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. The internal surface is concave and grooved for the tendons and vessels Fig. 145. â€” Dorsal surface of the left foot. I. Astraga- lus ; its superior quadrilateral arti- cular surface. 2.

At the antei'ior extremity of this sm-face is a projecting process (sustentaculum tali), which supports the anterior articulating surface of the astragalus, and serves as a pulley for the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. At the anterior extremitjj of the bone is a flat articulai' surface, surmounted by a rough prominence, which affords one of the guides to the surgeon in the performance of Chopart's operation. The posterior extremity is prominent and convex, and constitutes the â– jjosterior tuberosity y it is smooth for the upper half of its extent, where it corresponds with a'bursa ; and rough below, for the inser- tion of the tendo Achillis ; the lower part of this surface is bounded by the two inferior tuberosities. Articulations.â€”With tivo bones : astragalus and cuboid. In their articulated state a large oblique canal is situated between the astragalus and calcaneuin, being formed by the apposition of the two grooves, sulcus tali and sulcus calcanei. This canal is called the simis tarsi, and serves to lodge a strong interosseous jigament which ties the two bones together. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To eigJd: by the posterior tuberosity, to the tendo Achillis and plantaris ; by the inferior tuberosities and under surface, abductor hallucis, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor accessorius, and plantar fascia ; by the external surface, extensor brevis digitorum ; and by the sustentacuhim tali, a few fibres of the tibialis posticus. SCAPHOID.â€”This bone may be distinguished l)y its boat-like figure, being concave on one side, and convex with three facets on tlie other. It presents for examination six surfaces ; three articular and three non-articular. The anterior surface is convex, and divided into three facets to articulate with the three cuneiform bones ; the posterior is concave to articulate Avith the rounded head of the astragalus. The superior surface is convex and rough, and the inferior somewhat concave and uneven. The external extremity is hvoad and rough ; the internal pointed and pi'ominent, forming a tuberosity (tubercle of the scaphoid) which gives attachment to part of the tendon of the tiliialis posticus. The external extremity sometimes presents a facet of articulation with the cul)oid. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held so that the convex articular surface with three facets look forwards, and the convex non-articular surface upwards, the broad extremity will point to the side corre- sponding with the foot to which the bone Ijelongs. Articulations.â€”With four bones: astragalus and three cunei- iorm, sometimes also with the cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the tendon of the tibialis posticus INTERNAL CUNEIFORM.â€”The internal cuneiform may be known .y Its irregular wedge shape, and by being larger than the two other bones which bear the same name. It presents for examination a convex and a concave surface, a long and a short articular border, and a small and a lai'ge extremity. The convex surface is internal and free, and assists in forming the170 MIDDLE CUNEIFORM. inner Ijorder of tlie foot; it presents near its anterior extremity a smooth facet, into which part of tlie tendon of tlie til)ialis anticus is inserted. The concave is external, and is marked Ijy an inverted L- shaped articular surface, limited to its superior and posterior borders, for articulation with the middle cuneifoi'in and second metatarsjil bone. The long border is l<idney-sha]ied, and articulates with the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; the short border is posterior, and ai'ticulates with the scaphoid bone. The small extj-emity (edge) is sharp, and is dir-ected upwards ; the larger extremity (l)ase) looks towards the sole of the foot, and is rounded into a Itroad tuljerosity. Recognition.â€”^Place the bone so that the small extremity may look upwards and the kidney-shaped articular border foi'wards ; the depression in the middle of the latter will point to the side corre- sponding with the foot to which it belongs. Articulations.â€”With four liones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, and first two luetatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the tibialis anticus and posticus and ])eroneus longus. MIDDLE CUNEIFORM. â€”The middle cuneiform is the smallest of the three ; it is wedge-shaped, tlie broad extremity being placed upwards, the sharp end down- wards in the foot. It presents for examina- tion four articular sur- faces and two free bor- ders. The anterior and jjosterior surfaces have nothing worthy of re- mark, excepting that the former extends the whole de]ith of the bone, while the latter is limited to its upper two-thirds. The inter- nal lateral surface has an L-shaped articular facet, extending along its upper and posterior margins for the internal cuneiform ; the external has an articular facet limited to the posterior border for the external cuneiform bone. Recognition.â€”If the bone be held so that the flat dorsal surface look upwards, its broadest edge being towards the holder, the articular surface, limited to the po.sterior border, will point to the side to which the bone belongs.

EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM.â€”The external cuneiform is intermediate in size Ijetween the tw^o preceding, and placed, like the middle, with the broad end upwards, and sharp extremity downwards. It may be identitied by a triangular articular facet on its outer side. It presents for examination four surfaces, and a suiDerior and inferior extremity. The anterior mrface is wedge-shaped and articular throughout its entire depth, for articulation with the third meta- tarsal. The 'posterior surface^ also wedge-shaped, is articular only in its upper two-thirds, the lower part being rough for the attacliment of ligaments. The exttrnal surface presents posteriorly a large smooth oval articular surface for the cuboid bone, and anteriorly at its upper angle a small facet for the base of the fourth metatarsal. The internal sv.rface also has two facets separated by a rougli de- pression, one along the posterior margin for the middle cuneiform, and the other at the upper and anterior angle of the bone for tlie Ijase of the second metatarsal. The 'wpper extremity is flat, of an oblong s([uare form, and bevelled posteriorly, at the expense of the outer surface, into a sharp edge ; the loioer extremity forms a rounded I'idge which serves for the attachment of the tibialis posticus and l)art of the flexor brevis hallucis. Recognition.â€”Hold the bone with the ilat dorsal surface upwards and the narrower wedge-sliaped articular surface directed 1)ackwards ; the large oval articular facet for the cuboid will then itoint to the side to which the l)one belongs. Articulations.â€”With six bones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, cuboid, and second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the flexor brevis hallucis and tibialis posticus. CUBOID.â€”The cuboid Ijone is irregularly cnboid in shaj^e, and marked on its under surface by a deep groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. It presents for examination six surfaces, three articular and three non-articular. The nan-articular surfaces aveâ€”superior, which is slightly convex, and assists in forming the dorsum of the foot; inferior, marked b}- a prominent ridge, the tuherositij, and a deep groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus ; and external, the smallest of the whole, and deeply notched by the commencement of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are --l)ostenor, of large size, and concavo-convex, to articulate with the OS calcis; anterior, of smaller size, divided by a slight ridge into two facets, for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones ; and internal, a small oval articular facet, \ipon a large and quadrangular surface, lor the external cuneiform bone. Recognition,â€”If the bone be held so that the plantar surface, with the i.eroneal groove, look downwards, and the largest articular .surface backwards, the small non-articular surface, marked by the deep notch, will point to the side to which the bone belongs *METATAHSAL BONES. 172 Articulations.â€”With four bones : os calcis, external cuneifomi, fourtli and Hftli nietatai'sal bone, and sometimes the sca])]ioid. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To two: flexor brevis hallucis, and adductor hallucis. Upon a consideration of the articulations of the tarsus it will l)e observed that each bone articulates with four adjoining bones, witli the excei^tion of the calcaneuni, which articulates with two, and the external cuneiform with six. Development.â€”By a single centre for each bone, with the excep- tion of the OS calcis, which has an epijjhysis for its i)osterior tul^ero- sity. The centres appear in the following order : calcanean, sixth month ; astragalan, seventh month ; cuboid, ninth month ; external cuneiform, end of the first year ; internal cuneiform, during the third year ; middle cuneiform and scaphoid, during the fourth year. The epii)hysis of the calcaneuni ajjpears at the tenth year, and is united with the diaphysis at about the fifteenth. METATARSAL BONES." These bones, five in number, are long bones, and divisible there- fore into a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is prismoid, and compressed from side to side ; the posterior extremity, or base, is wedge-shaped, to articulate with, the tarsal bones, and with each other; the anterior extremity presents a rounded head, circum- scribed by a neck, to articulate with the first row of the phalanges. Peculiar Metatarsal Bones.â€”The first is shorter and larger than the rest, and forms part of the inner border of the foot; its posterior extremity has no lateral facet, but jjresents a large kidney-shaj)ed surface at its l)ase, and an oval rough ])rominence Ijeneath for the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. The head of the bone has, on its plantar surface, two grooved facets, for sesamoid l)ones. To find the side to which the bone belongs, hold it with the base towards yon and the convex surface niDwards; the con- cavity of the kidney-shaped surface will then point to the appro- priate side. The second is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones ; it jjresents at its base an articular facet for the middle cunei- form bone, and has on its outer lateral surface four facets, two for the outer cuneiform and two for the third metatarsal. On its inner surface it has only one facet, for the internal cuneiform. If the bone be held with its" head directed forwards and the convex surface of the shaft upwards, the four lateral facets will point to the side to which it belongs. The third may be known by two facets on the inner side of its base, corresponding with the second, and one on the outer side for the fourth metatarsal. It may be distinguished also by its smaller size. When held in the usual position, the side with the single lateral facet will indicate the foot to which the bone belongs.PLATE 20.Ii73 PHALANGES. The fourth may be distinguished hy its smaller size, and by having a single articular surface on each side of the base, the facet on the outer side being bounded distally by a very deep pit for an inter- osseous ligament. When held with the base backwards and dorsal surface upwards, the most prominent angle at the base will point to the foot to which the bone belongs. The fifth is recognised by its broad base, and by the large tuberosity at its outer side. Development.â€”Each bone by tivo centres ; one for the body and one for the digital extremity in the four outer metatarsal bones ; and one for the body, the other for the base, in the metatarsal bone of the great toe. In the latter toe there is frequently a second or distal epiphysis. Ossification appears in the shafts of these bones at about the eighth or ninth week ; the epiphyses appear in the heads of the metatarsals of the four outer toes about the third year, and in the base of that of the great toe iu the fifth year, consolida- tion being effected at eighteen. Articulations.â€”With the tarsal bones by one extremity, and first row of phalanges by the other. Tlie numl^er of tarsal "bones with which each metatarsal articulates from Avithin outwards, is the same as between the bones of the metacarpus and carpus, one for the first, three for the second, one for the third, two for the fourtli, and one for the fifth. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To fourteen: to the first, peroneus longus and first dorsal interosseous ; to the second, two dorsal inter- ossei and transversus pedis ; to the third, two dorsal and one plantar interosseous, adductor hallucis and transvei'sus pedis ; to the fourth, two dorsal and one plantar interosseous, adductor hallucis and trans- versus pedis; to tlie fifth, one dorsal and one plantar interosseous, peroneus brevis, peroneus tertius, al)ductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversus pedis. PHALANGES. There are two phalanges in the great toe and three in the other toes, as in the hand. They are long bones, divisible into a central portion and extremities. The phalanges of the first row are convex above, concave on the under surface, and compressed from side to side. The proximal ex- tremity has a single concave articular surface, for the head of the metatarsal bone ; the distal extremity, a pullev-like surface, for the second phalanx. The second phalanr/es are short and diminuti\-e, but somewhat broader than those of the first row. The third or ungual phalanges, including the second phalanx of the great toe, are flattened from above downwards, spread out later- ally at the base to articulate with the second row, and at the oppo- site extrenuty to support the nail and the rounded extremitv of the toe.'74 SESAMOID BONES. Development.â€”By hco centres ; one for tlie body and one for the metatarsal extremity. Ossification commences in these bones after the metatarsus, appearing firstly in last i)]ialanges, then in the first, and lastly m the middle row. The centres for the epiphyses appear during the fourth year for tlie first row, and the sixth year lor the otJier two rows. Tlie bones are comijleted at eigliteen. Articulations.â€”The first row with the metatarsal l)ones and second i)ha]anges ; the second, of the gi-eat toe, with the first pha- lanx ; of the other toes, with the first and third i)lialanges; the third, with tlie second row. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To twenty-three: to the first phalanges; great toe, innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, abductor hallucis, adductor liallucis, fiexoi- brevis liallucis, and transversus pedis ; second toe, first and second dorsal interosseous and lumbri- zaMa; third toe, third dorsal and first plantar interosseous and lunibricalis ; fourth toe, fourth dorsal and second plantar interosseous and lunibricalis ; fifth toe, tliird plantar interosseous, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti and lunibricalis. Berond phalanges : great toe, extensor longus liallucis, and flexor longiis hallucis ; other toes, one slip of the common tendon of the extensor loiigus and extensor breA-is digitorum, and flexor brevis digitorum. Third pha- langes: two slijjs of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor bre\'is digitorum, and the fiexor longus digitorum. SESAMOID BONES. These are small masses, cartilaginous in early life, osseous in the adult, developed in those tendons which exert a certain degree of force 111)011 the surface over which they glide, or where, by continued ]iressure and friction, the tendon would become a source of ii'ritation to neighbouring j)arts, as to joints. The best example of a sesamoid bone is the i?atella, developed in the common tendon of the quad- riceps extensor, and resting against the front of the knee-joint. Be- sides the patella, there are four paii'S of sesamoid bones constantly found, two on the iiietacarpo-phalangeal articulation of each thumb, and existing in the tendons' of insertion of the fiexor brevis ])ollici.>i, and two on the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons of the muscles inserted into the base of the first phalanx. In addition to these there is often a sesamoid bone on the iiietacarpo-plialangeiil joint of the little finger ; and on the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons inserted into the base of the first ])halaiix ; there is one also in the tendon of the ])eroneus longus muscle, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone ; sometimes in the tendons, as they wind around the inner and outer malleolus ; in the psoas and iliacus, where they glide over the os j^ubis ; and in the external head of the gastrocnemius. The bones of the tympanum, as they belong to the apparatus of hearing, will be described with the anatomy of the ear.'75 PART III. ARTHROLOGY. Articulations or joints are the means by wliicli the bones of the skeleton are united" together, tlie same terms being also applied to the union between cartilages when these are adapted for movenient on each other, as, for instance, in the larynx. The connections between the bones may take place simply l)y the intervention of a small quantity of connective tissue, and the union be so close as to render movement impossil)le, forming an immovable joint, or Syn- arthrosis ; or the bones may be widely separated, and tlie substance lying between them and connecting them together may be so yield- ing as to admit of a limited degree of movement in several direc- tions, forming a yielding joint, or Amphi-arthrosis. In all the articulations of the limbs, however, Ave find a more elaborate and perfect arrangement admitting of much freer motion, constituting a movable joint, or Diarthrosis. In the latter the expanded ends of the bones are coated by a thin layer of cartilage, are connected togetlier l)y l)ands of fibrous tissue called ligaments, and are lubri- cated by the Huid secreted by a synovial memljrane which lines the inner surface of the ligaments ; in many joints, also, a disc of libro-cartilage is interposed between the articulai' surfaces, and the cavity divided into two, the advantages of a double joint being thus secured. The structures entering into the composition of a joint are bone, cartilage, areolar and adipose tissue, elastic tissue, fibrous tissue, and synovial memljrane ; the microscopic anatomy of these has been fully descril)ed in Part I. of this work, but it remains to point out their peculiar arrangement in the construction of joints. The ariiciUar ends of lone/ hones are expanded and rendered either I concave or convex, so as to fit each other ; they are formed of can- cellous tissue with an outer thin coating of dense bone. This layer of compact bone is called the articular lamella; it is distinguished from ordinary bone by the absence of Haversian canals, the large ^ size of the lacunae, and by the canaliculi being few in number, and so short as not to communicate with those derived from neighbour- ing lacuna). The vessels of the cancellous tissue do not penetrate the articular lamella, but turn back in loops before reaching it. In some places the bones are produced into projecting processes which176 ARTHROLOGY. overliang the joint, airorrling protection against external injury, as well as giving greater leverage to the muscles ; this ai-raiigeme^t may be noticed in the elbow, ankle, and wrist joints. The airtilage found in joints is of two kinds, hyaliije atjfil filito. cartilage. The former is known as true articular cartilage, or cfirti- lage of incrustation ; it coats the articular surfaces of the Ijones, and is generally so arranged as to increase the depth of articular ^xvitia"^ and the prominence of articular convexities, being in the one case thickest at its edges, and in the other in the middle. Fibro-cartilage is in amphi-arthrodial joints the connecting medium ])inding the bones together ; in diarthrodial joints it forms encircling l)ands which deepen the articular cavities, or it occurs as conca\'e discs (interarticular fil )ro-cartilages) which divide the joint into two parts, each part having its own synovial membrane. Areolar and adiijone tissue are used for filling up the interstices in and around joints, so as to ensure the perfect adaptation of the articular surfaces to each other ; in joints (such as tlie knee) whicli received little protection from the surrounding muscles, the amount of fat found among the ligaments and beneath the superficial fascia is relatively very large. The ligaments which connect the bones together are for the most part foi'med of strong l)ands of white fibroiis tissue, \mi in some feAv a slight admixture of yellow fibres niay be observed, and those con- necting the laminae of the vertebroe (ligamenta subflava) are entirely formed of yellow or elastic tissue. In the joints possessing the freest moA'ement the ligaments form a fibrous envelope which en- tirely surrounds and encloses the articular surfacesâ€”these are called capsular ligavients; in those enjoying the next degree of mobility the ligaments exist as flattened bands arranged in front, l>eliind, aiid at the sides of the articulation. Some few joints have ligamen- tous bands in their interior ; examples of these are the ligamentum teres of the hi}) and crucial ligaments of the knee ; they are en- closed in a tube formed of synovial membrane. The synovial membrane lines the whole of the interior of the joint, except where the articular cartilage is interposed ; it is smooth and glistening on the inner surface, rough externally where it becomes attached to the bones and ligaments ; it often forms folds, Avhich project into the interior of the joint and contain masses of fat with loops of capillary vessels. Besides the structures which form the joints, others also contribute to keep the articular ends of the bones in place, and to ensure due and smooth movement ; of these the most important are the muwlcs and bursce. The muscles not only act as the agents of motion, but are of essential service in maintaining the structures of the joint in their proper relative position, supporting the ligaments by their tonic contraction, and in some instances acting directly on the synovial membrane so as to jjrevent its becoming stpieezed between the ends of the bones. In the shoulder-joint the tendon of a muscle passes through the synovial cavity, and in both that joint and the knee the177 BURSyE MUCOSA. tendons of certain muscles take the place of ligaments and are coated on their interior by synovial membrane. Bursse mucosae are closed synovial sacs, the structure of which has been described on a previous page. Some of them lie between the tendons of muscles and the ligaments of joints, and in this position often communicate with the cavities of those joints ; this being especially apt to occur with the bursa which lies lietween the capsule of tlie liip-joint and the united tendons of the psoas and iliacus. Bursfe occur (i) l)etween tendons and bones, (2) between tendons and ligaments, (3) lietween superficial bony prominences and the fascite beneath the skin, (4) l)etween contiguous tendons, and (5) between neighbouring bones. They are very numerous, about 140 being found in the human body. Siiperjicial hursce are constantly found in the following positions :â€”In the head and neck they occur on each angle of the lower jaw, beneath the symphysis of the jaw, and on the salient angle of the thyroid cartilage. In the upper extremity, over the acromion process, on the external and internal condyles of the humerus, on the liack of the olecranon, the styloid processes of the ]'adius and ulna, and the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the metacarpo-phalanQ;eal joints. In the lower extremity they are found on the anterior superior spine of the iliiim, over the great trochantei', on the tuberosity of the ischium, the lower half and the upper and outer angle of the patella, on the outer and inner condyles of the femui', the outer and inner tuljerosities of the tibia, the head of the til)ula, the outer and inner malleoli, the ]iosterior and inner face of the OS calcis, and the dorsal surface of the articulations of the toes. The (hep bnrsce lie between the tendons of muscles, or between the tendons and joints ; these are even more numerous than the super- ficial ones, so that only a few of the more important will be mentioned here. These are the bursa beneath the deltoid, that between the tendon of the psoas and capsule of the hip-joint, one beneath the tendon of insertion of the triceps, one beneath the ligamentnm patelltB, one between the gluteus rnaximus and vastus externus, one beneath the tendon of insertion of the biceps of the arm, and one between the tendon of insertion of the senn-meml)ranosus and the inner head of the gastrocnemius. Besides these normal burste, other accidental or pathological ones are formed wherever there is great ])ressure, as, for instance, on the parts of the foot which come in con- tact with the ground in club-foot, and on the ends of stumps after amputation. Blood-vessels.~The arteries distributed to a joint pass to all the structures excepting the cartilages, which are non-vascular; they frequently form fine circles round the edges of the cartilage, and are more especially abundant in the synovial membrane. iVerres.â€”Hilton formulated a law regarding the distribution of nerves to joints, whicli is as follows :â€”"The same trunks of nerves, whose bT'anches sup].ly the groups of muscles moving a joint, furnish also a distribution of nerves to the skin over the insertion of the same muscle,rt?;c/ the interior of the joint receives its nerves from the same source."ARTICULATIONS. 178 TABLE OF ARTICULATIONS.

SYNARTHROSIS {crxjv, ap6paaLs, articulation) includes all those articulations in which there is no apjjreciable movement, the bones being united only by a small quantity of connective tissue, some- times described under the name of the sutural ligament. This class of joints includes all the articulations of the bones of the skull and face, excepting those of the lower jaw. There are three kinds of synarthrosis ; namely. Suture, Schindylesis, and Gomphosis. Suture (sutura, a seam) is the name given to a joint in which the edges of the bone are projected into fine irregular i^rocesses, which fit into the intervals between corresponding processes in the bone with which it joins, somewhat like the dove-tail joint in cabinet- work. Between the bones so articulating there is a small quantity of connective tissue, which in the young skull is continuous with the pericranium on the outside, and with the dura mater on the inside. Three varieties of suture are distinguished,â€”the Serrated, Harmonia, and Squamous. The sorated suture is formed by the union of two borders possessing serrated edges, as in the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoidal sutures. In these sutures the serrations are formed almost wholly by the external table, the edges of the internal table lying merely in apposition. The serrated suture is formed by the interlocking of the radiating fibres along the edges of the flatARTICULATIONS. 179 bones of the cranium during growth. A variation in the formation of the serrated suture is seen in the coronal suture, where the edge of the bone is bevelled at the expense of tlie inner table of the one bone, and of the outer table of the other at one part; and in another part'these conditions are reversed. This condition is sometimes described under the name of sutura limbosa. The harmonia suture {(Ipelv, to adapt) is the simple apposition of contiguous surfaces, the surfaces being more or less rough. This suture is seen in the con- nection between the superior maxillary bones, or of the palate pro- cesses of the palate bone Avith each other. The squamous suture is formed by the overlapping of the lower border of the parietal bone, by the thin scale-like edge of the squamous portion of the temporal. Schindylesis {a-xtv^vXTjais, a fissure) is the reception of one bone into a sheath or fissure of another, as occurs in the articulation of the rostrum of the sphenoid with the vomer, or of the latter a\ ith the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and with the nasal crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. Gomphosis (yo/xc^oy, a nail) is expressive of a union similar to that of a peg driven into a socket, and is used to describe the articulation of the teeth with the ah'eoli of the upper and lower jaws. The term is, however, misleading, as the teeth are not held in place simply by their impact, but by the fibrous tissue forming the alveolo-dental membrane. AMPHI-ARTHROSIS (d/i0t, both, apdpcoo-ts) is a joint intermediate in aptitude for motion l^etween the immovable synarthrosis and the movable diarthrosis. Two forms of it are described, namely, those where the union takes place entirely by means of fibro-cartilage, withoxit any joint cavity, and those Avhere some part of the joint is formed by surfaces coated with articular cartilage, between which tliere is a small synovial cavity. Examples of the first are seen in the union between the bodies of the vertebrcc, the sacrum with tlie coccyx, and the pieces of the sternum ; and of the second, tlie sacro- iliac and pubic symphyses (avv (j)vdv, to grow together). DIARTHROSIS (Sta,'through, apepaais) is the movable articula- tion which constitutes by far the greater number of the joints of tlie body. The degree of motion in this class has given rise to a subdi\ ision into five genera : Arthrodia, Ginglymus, Trochoides, Condylarthrosis, and Enarthrosis. Arthrodia is the movable joint in which the extent of motion is slight and limited, as in the articulations of the clavicle, ril)s, articular processes of the vertebras, axis with the atlas, radius with the ulna, fibula with the tibia, carpal and metacarpal, tarsal and metatarsal bones. It is formed by the apposition of two nearly plane articular surfaces. The movement is very limited, but by l)ringing together a number of small bones articulated in this way, gi-eat pliability is obtained, as may be observed in the carpus. Ginglymus (ytyyXu^xoj, a hinge), or hinge-joint, is the movement of bones upon each other in two directions only, viz., forwards and backwards ; but the degree of motion may be very considerable.AR'J'ICULA'JIONS. Instances of this form of joint a7'e nuinerons ; tliey conipreliend tliL" dhow and phalangeal joints in the u])pei' extremity ; tlie knee, ankle, and phalangeal joints in the lower extremity. The articula- tion of t he lower jaw exhibits an example of the combination of this form of joint with the preceding, the joint between the interarticular cartilage and eminentia articularis i)eing arthrodial, and that be- tween the cartilage and the condyle ginglymous. The form of the ginglymoid joint is soiiiewhat quadrilateral, each of its four sides being provided with a ligament, which is named from its position, anterior, posterior, infernal lateral, or external lateral. The lateral ligaments are thick and strong, and the chief bond of union between the bones. The anterior and fstei-ior are thin and loose in order to pei'mit the required extent of movement. Trochoides or lateral ginglymus (pivot-joint) is a form of joint f)f which there exist only two examples in the human body, namely, the articulation of the anterior arch of the atlas and transverse liga- ment with the odontoid process of the axis, and the superior radio- ulnar joint. In the first of these a ring conqDosed partly of bone and partly of ligament rotates round a ])ivot, in the second the rounded bone moves within a ring formed of ligamentous filjres ; in both the movement is purely rotatory. Condylarthrosis {condyloid articulation) is a variety of joint in which an ovoid condyle is received into an elliptical cavity, so as to permit of flexion, extension, abduction,adduction, and circumduction, but no axial rotation. Examples of this form are seen in the wrist- joint, and metacarpo-phalangeal and metatarso-phalangeal articula- tions. Enarthrosis (eV, in, apdpaxris) is the most extensive in its range of motion of all the movable joints. From the manner of connection and form of the bones in this articulation, it is called the ball-and- socket joint. There are two instances in the body, namely, the hi]) and the shoulder. The ball-and-socket joint has a circular form ; and, in place of the foui' distinct ligaments of the ginglymus, is enclosed in a bag of ligamentous membrane, called capsular licjament. We may add to the preceding the cari)o-metacarpal articulation of the thumb, although not strictly a ball-and-socket joint, from the great extent of motion which it enjoys, and from the nature of the ligament connecting the bones. Some authors make a s])ecial geiuis for tliis joint, under the title of art'.culation bj/ recipirocal surfaces. MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS. The motions of joints may be referred to four heads, viz.. Gliding, Angular movement. Circumduction, and Rotation. I. Gliding is the simple movement of one articulai- surface on another, and exists to a greater or less extent in all the joints. In the least movable joints, as in the cai'pus and tai'sus, this is the only motioii which is pei-niitted. Gliding is, in certain joints,i8i JIOVEMENTS OF JOINTS. accom])aiiied by wbat is known as coaptation, that is, tlie successive apjjlication of clilferent jiarts of an articular surface to its fellow, in tlie manner of a wheel rolling on the ground. This is well seen in tlie motion of the imtella on the condyles of the femur. 2. Angular movement maybe performed in four different direc- tions, either forwards and backwards, as in flexion and extension ; or inwards and outwards, constituting adduction and abduction. Flexion and extension are illustrated in the ginglynioid joint, and exist in a large proportion of the joints of the body. Adduction and abduction, conjoined with flexion and extension, are met with coiii- lilete only in the most movable joints, as the shoulder, hip, and thumb. In the wrist and ankle, adduction and abduction are only jiartial. 3. Circumduction is most strikingly exhibited in the shoulder and hip joints ; it consists in the slight degree of motion which takes ]ilace between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, Avhile the extremity of the limb is made to describe a large circle on a ])lane surface. It is also seen, but in a less degree, in the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb, and the metacar230-j)lialangeal articulation of the fingers and toes. 4. Rotation is the movement of a lione on its own axis, and is illustrated in the hip and shoulder, or better, in the rotation of the cu]-) of the radius against the eminentia cajjitata of the humerus. Rotation is also observed in the movements of the atlas u]ion the axis, where the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns. AETICULATIOIsTS. The joints may be arranged, according to a natural division, into those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. LIGAMENTS OF THE TRUNK. The articulations of the trunk are divisible into eleven groups namely:â€” Â» 1 ) 1. Of the vertebral column. 2. Of the atlas, with the occi])ital bone. 3. Of the axis, with the occii)ital bone. 4. Of the atlas, with the axis. 5. Of the lower jaw. 6. Of the ribs, with the vertebra). 7. Of the costal cartilages, A\'ith the sternum, and w ith each other. 8.

ARTICULATIONS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN.â€”The liga- ments connecting together the dill'erent jneces of the vertebral column, admit of the same arrangement as the vertebrae them- selves. Thus the ligaments Of the bodies, are the Anterior common ligament. Posterior common ligament, Interverteljral sul)stance. Ligamenta suljHava. Gajjsular ligaments. Synovial memljranes. Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous. Of the transverse processes, Inter-transverse. Of the arches, Of the articular processes Of the spinous processes, Bodies.â€”The anterior common ligament is a broad and riljbon- like l)and of ligamentous fibres, extending along the front sur- /~) face of the A^erte- iC^-o-^^^ bral column, from the axis to the sac- rum, and becoming broader as it de- scends. It is in- timately connected Avith the interver- tebi'al substance, and less clo.sely with the bodies of the vertebrte. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lumbar, and consists of a median and tAvo lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of vessels. The ligament is composed of fibres of various lengths closely interwoven with Fig. 147.â€”Anterior ligament of the vertebra;, and liga- ments of the ribs. i. An- terior common ligament. 2.

The posterior com- mon ligament is situ- ated in the spinal canal; it lies oil the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, and ex- tends from the axis to the sacrum. It is broad opposite the intcrverteljral substance, to which it is closely adherent; narroAV and thick over the bodies of the vertebrao, from which it isLIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 183 separated by the veins of the body of each vertebra ; it thus comes to present a festooned or dentate margin. It is composed, like the anterior ligament, of shorter and longer fibres, arranged in a similar manner. It is broader above than below, the reverse of the anterior common ligament, and is thicker in the dorsal than in the cervical or lumbar region. At its upper end it is continuous with the posterior occipito-axial ligament. The intervertebral substance is a lenticular disc of fibro-carti- lage, interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum, and retaining them firmly in connection with each other. The discs vary in thickness in different parts of the column and at different points of the same disc, being thickest in the lumbar region, deeper in front than behind in the cervical and luml)ar regions, and contribute to the Fig. i49.-Diagram of an inter- . , â€¢ Â° c J1 ^ 1 r vertebral disc divided vei-tically. formation of the natural curves of a, the pulpy centre; at b, the the vertebral Coli;mn.

Wlien the intervertebral substance is bisected either horizontally or vertically, it is seen to be composed of a series of layers of fil)ro- cartilage mixed Avith fibrous tissue. The central part of each inter- vertebral disc is much softer than the rest; it has the appearance of pulp, and is so elastic as to rise above the level of the section as soon as its division is completed. Examined from the exterior, the layers are found to consist of fibres passing obliquely between the two vertebras, in one layer passing from left to right, in the next from right to left, alternating in each successive layer. Examined micro- scopically, the central pulp is found to be composed of fine fibrous tissue su])porting cells some of which resemble those of cartilage ; it is generally regarded as a persistent part of the chorda dorsalis. The central pulp and several layers of fibres surrounding it, are separated from the bone of the vertebral bodies by a thin layer of cartilage. Arches.â€”The ligamenta subflava are two thin planes of yellow fibrous tissue, situated between the arches of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum.. From the imbricated position of the laminae, they are attached to the posterior surface of the vertebra below, and the anterior surface of the arch of the vertebra above, being separated from each other in the cervical region at the middle line by a slight interspace filled with areolar tissue. In the dorsal and lumbar regions they are continued for a little way on to the roots of the spinoiTS processes, where they unite with the interspinous ligaments and with each other. They counteract, by their elasticity, the effortsLIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. of tlie Ikixoi' )iiusclt'S(.r tlu; ti'unk ; and, ])r(;s(',iTii)g tlie u])riglit ])osi- tion ol tlie .si)ine, limit the expenditure of niusculai' force. They are longest in the cervical and thickest in the lunihar region. The liganienta suljfiava are continued in the cervical i-egion on to the inner .side, and in the doi'.sal and Inmljar regions on to both antei-ior and inner sides of the articular ]">rocesses, so as to form pai't of the cajisules of the joints. Articular Processes.â€”The liga- ments of the articular processes of the vertebra; are thin capsules of wliite and yellow fil)res wliich surround and enclose the synovial membrane; the latter being looser in the cervical than in the other regions of the spine. Spinous Processes. â€” The inter- spinous ligaments, thin and inem- bi'anous, are extended l)etween the spinous processes in the dorsal and lumbar region ; being thickest in the latter. They are in relation with the interspinous muscles at each side. The supraspinous ligament (Fig. 159) is a strong, ill)rous cord, extending from the apex of the spinous jjrocess of the last cervical veT'telira to the coccyx, and attached to each s^^inous process in its course. Like the anterior and posterior connnon ligaments, it is composed of fibres of unecpuil length, the deeper fibres i)assing from one vertebra to the next, the superficial fibres extending over several spinous processes. It is thickest in the lumbar region. The con- tinuation of this ligament upwards to tlie tuljerosity of the occipital bone, constitutes the rudimentary ligamentum nuclia3 of man. TIr' latter is strengthened, as in animals, by a thin slip from the spinous process of each cervical vertebra. At its lower termination the supraspinous ligament s]ireads out to cover the end of the sjiinal canal, exposed hj the deficiency of the laminse of the lower sacral and coccygeal A'ertebrse. Transverse Processes.â€”The intertransverse ligaments are represented in the cervical region only Ijy a few scattered fibres, in the dor.sal region they are rounded cords, and in the lumbal" region they are thin and membranous. Movements of the Spine.â€”Flexion and extension take place freely in the cervical and lumbal- regions, l)ut especially in the latter ; in the dorsal region these movements are very slight in consequence of the imbrication of the lamina; and the small amount of intervertebral substance. Rotation is free in the neck, but in consequence of the direction of the articular ])rocesses takes place round an oblique axis, the articular process of one side moving Fig. 150.â€”Internal view of the arches of three vertebraj.

In the dorsal region rotation is free (especially in the upper part), the movement taking place I'ound an axial line running through the centre of the vertebral bodies. The articular processes of the lumbar region are so disposed as to prevent anything like free rotation, but as the capsules are lax and the facets do not fit closely to each other, a slight degree of rotatory motioai does take place. Lateral flexion may take place in any part of the spine, but is most free in the cervical and lumbar I'egions. 2. AETICULATION OF THE ATLAS WITH THE OCCIPITAL BONE. â€”The ligaments of this articulation az^e seven in number :â€” Two anterior occipito-atlantal, Posterior occipito-atlantal.

It is closely adherent to the dura mater, by its inner surface ; and forms a ligamentous arch at each side for the passage of the vertel)i"al artery and first cervical nerve. It corresponds in its position to the ligamenta sub- flava of the other vertebrae, but it has no elastic filjres, l)eing com- posed entirely of white fibrous tissue. The two lateral ligaments are strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, attached below to the base of the transverse process of the atlas at each side ; and above, to the transverse process of the occipital bone. The capsular ligaments are thin and loose ligamentous capsules which surround the synovial membranes of the articulations between the condyles of the occipital Ijone and the superior articular pro- cesses of the atlas. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous on the anterior and external part of the articulation. The movements taking place between the cranium and atlas are those of flexion and extension, giving rise to the forward nodding of the head ; there is also a slight lateral movement to either side. When either of these actions is increased to any extent, the whole of the cervical region concurs in its production. 3. ARTICULATION OF THE AXIS WITH THE OCCIPITAL BONE. â€”The ligaments of this articulation are four in number :â€” Occipito-axial, Three odontoid. The occipito-axial ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a broad and strong band, which covers in the odontoid process and its ligaments. It is attached below to the body of the axis, where it Fig. 153.â€”Upper part of the vertebral canal, opened from behind in order to show the occipito-axial ligament, i.

The odontoid ligaments {alar or elude licjanunts) are two short and thick fasciculi, which pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. A third and smaller fasciculus (ligamentum dentis suspensorium) proceeds from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum.LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. 187 These ligaments serve to limit the extent of rotation of the head ; hence they are termed check ligaments. 4. ARTICULATION OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS.â€”The liga- ments of this articulation are five in number :â€” Anterior atlanto-axial, Two capsular, Posterior atlanto-axial, Transverse. The anterior ligament consists of ligamentous fibres which pass from the anterior tubercle and arch of the atlas to the base of the odontoid j)rocess and body of the axis, where they are continuous with the commencement of the anterior common ligament. The fibres in the middle form a thick band which is tense in all positions of the joints ; the lateral jjortions are thin, and assist in limiting the rotation of the atlas on the axis. The posterior ligament is a thin, membranous layer, passing between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminte of the axis ; it represents the ligamenta subflava in a rudimentary state, and has on its deep or anterior surface a layer of dense elastic fibres, like those of the latter. The capsular ligaments surround the articular process of the atlas and axis ; they are loose, to permit of the free movement which exists between these A^ertebras. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous on the outer and anterior part of the articulation ; and the synovial vievibrane of each joint often communicates with the synovial cavity between the transverse ligament and odontoid process. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band, which arches across the area of the ring of the atlas from a rough tubercle Fig. 154.â€”Posterior view of the ligaments connecting the atlas, axis, and occipital bone.

As it crosses the neck of the odontoid process, some fibres are sent down- wards to be attached to the body of the axis, and others pass upwards to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone ; hence the ligament has a cross-like appearance, and is termed cruciform. A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligamenti88 TEMPORO-MAXILLAEY ARTICULATION and odontoid jirocess ; and another between tliat process and liie antei-ior arcli of tlie atlas. Actions.â€”It is the peculiai' disposition of tlie transverse ligament in relation to the odontoid ]irocess that enables the atlas, and witli it the entire craninni, to rotate upon the axis ; the perfect freedom of movement between these l)ones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower pai't of the ring, formed bv the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, Avhile the summit of the odontoid process is lai-ger than its base ; hence the jirocess is retained in its place by the transverse ligament when the other liga- ments are cut through. The extent to which rotation of the hearl u])on the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid or check ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axial ligament. S. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION.â€”Tlie ligaments of this joint are the following :â€” External lateral, Two internal lateral, Capsular, Intei^articular libro-cartilage, Stylo-maxil lary 1 igament, Two synovial membranes. The external lateral ligament is a short and thick l)and of hbres, passing obliquely backwards from the tubercle of the zygoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. It is incorporated with the capsular ligament, and is, in relation, ex- ternally, with the integument of the face; internally, with the two synovial membranes of the articulation and the interarticular cartilage.

The capsular ligament consists of numerous irregular ligament- ous fih]-es, which pass from the edge of the glenoid cavity to the neck of the lower jaw, and surround the articulation. The capsule is thickest where it receives the acces- sory fil)res called external and short internal lateral ligaments ; it has inserted into it anteriorly a few fi))res of the external pterygoid muscle. The interarticular fibro-carti- lage is a thin oval plate, thicker at tlte edges tlian in the centre, ]tlaced horizontally between the liead of the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface is, from befoi'e Ivack- wards, concaveanterioi'lyandslightly convex posteriorly, the former por- tion fitting the eminentia articularis, and tlie latter the glenoid cavity ; its under surface is concave to receive the convex condyle.

The interai'ticular fibro-cartilages of the knee-joint are i)artia], and thei'e is but one synovial membrane. The articulations of the heads of tlie ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament without tibro-cartilage. Connected with the lower jaw, though not with the joint, is the stylo-maxillary ligament, a process of the deep cervical fascia extended l^etween the i)oint of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw. It is attaclied to the jaw Ijetween the insertions of the masseter and internal pterygoid muscle ; it separates tlie parotid from the submaxillary gland, and gives attachment to some fibres of the stylo-glossus muscle. Actions.^â€”The movements of the lower jaw areâ€”dejyression, by which the mouth is opened ; elevation, by which it is closed ; a /or- ivard and backivard movement ; and a movement from side to side. In the movement of depression the interarticular cartilage glides for- ward on the eminentia articulaiis, carrying with it the condyle. In elevation the fibro-cartilage and condyle are returned to their original position. forward and backward movement is a gliding of the libro-cartilage on the eminentia articularis in the antero-posterior direction ; and the movement from side to side, in the lateral direc- tion. The articulation between the condyle and fibro-cartilage forms a true ginglymus or hinge-joint, that between the fibro-cartilage and eminentia articularis an arthrodial or gliding joint. The arteries of the temporo-maxillary joint are derived from the posterior auricular, anterior tympanic of internal maxillary, inferior or ascending palatine of facial, temporal, and nuddle meningeal. The nerves are chiefly derived from the auriculo-temj)oral, but some filaments also come from the masseteric branch of inferior maxillarv. 6. ARTICULATION OF THE RIBS WITH THE VERTEBR^ffi.â€” The ligaments of these articulations are remarkaljle for their strength, l^eing in fact so strong as to render dislocation impossible ; the neck of the rib must break before displacement could occur : they are divisible into two groups :â€”(i) Those connecting the head of the rib with the bodies of the vertebrae ; and (2) Those connecting the yieck and tubercle of the rib with the transverse processes. ist Group. 2nd Groiip.

Posterior costo-transverse ligament. the middle fasciculus is attached to the intervertebral substance ; the inferior to the vertebra below. In the first rib the ligament is not divided, but its fibres pass to the body of the last cervical as well as the first dorsal. In like manner the ligaments connected with the tenth, eleventli, and twelfth ribs pass to the body of the ver- tebra above, as Avell as to that with which the head of the rib articulates. The capsular liga- ment is a thin layer of ligamentous filires surrounding the joint in the interval left by the anterior ligament; it is thickest above and below the articula- tion, and protects the synovial membranes. The interarticular ligament is a short band of fibres which passes between the sliarp crest on tlie head of the rib and the inter- vertebral substance. It divides the joint into two cavities, each being furnished with a separate synovial viembrane. The first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs have no interarticular ligament, and consequently but one synovial membrane. The anterior (or superior) costo-transverse ligament is a broad l)and composed of two fas- ciculi, ^\-hich ascend from tlie crest- like ridge on the neck of the rib, to the transverse process immedi- ately above. The ligament sepa- rates the anterior from the dorsal branch of the intercostal nerve ; ' it is absent from the first rib. The middle costo-transverse ligament is a strong interosseous ligament passing directly between, the posterior surface of the neck of the rib, and the anterior surface of the transverse process against which It rests.

The posterior costo-transverse ligament is a small but strong fasciculus, passing obli(picly from tlie tuliercle of the ril> to the apex of the transverse pi'ocess. The articulation l)etween the tubercle of the rib and the transvei'se process is provided with a small synovial mend)rane. This ligament is al)sent in the two last ribs. Several accessory bands are found passing Itetween tlie transverse ])rocesses and tlie ribs ; a Ijroad Ijand of this kind cormects the last rib with the transverse process of the first or second lundiar vertebra. Actions.â€”The movements permitted by the articulations of the ril)S are ujnvards, downwards, and nMghUj forioards and backwards; the movement increasing in extent from the head to the extremity of the rib. The forward and backward movement is trifling in tlie seventh superior, but greater in the inferior ribs ; the eleventh and twelfth are very movable. 7. ARTICULATION OF THE COSTAL CARTILAGES WITH THE STERNUM, AND WITH EACH OTHER. â€” The ligaments of the chondro-sternal articulations are :â€” Anterior chondro-sternal, Superior chondro-sternal, Posterior chondro-sternal. Inferior chondro-sternal, Synovial membranes. The anterior chondro-sternal ligament (anterior stellate liga- ment) is a thin band of ligamentous fibres, passing in a radiated direction from the extremity of the costal cartilage to the anterior surface of the sternum, and intermingling its fibres with those of the ligament of the opposite side, and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoralis major muscle. The posterior chondro-sternal ligament, much smaller than the anterior, consists of a thin fasciculus of fibres, situated on the posterior surface of the articulation. The superior and inferior chondro-sternal ligaments are narrow fasciculi corresponding with the breadth of the cartilage, and connecting its superior and inferior liorder the side of the sternum. The synovial membrane is absent in the articulation of the first rib, its cartilage being usually adherent to the sternum ; that of the second rib has an interarticular ligament, with two synovial mem- branes ; the synovial meml)ranes of the other costal cartilages are single. 'the sixth and seventh ribs have several fasciculi of strong liga- mentous fibres, passing from the extremity of their cartilages to the anterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, which latter they are intended to support. They are named the chondro-xyphoid liga- TTP ftTL'tiS The "sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the fifth and the ninth costal cartilages, have articulations with each other, and a synovial membrane for each articulation. They are connected by li"amentous fibres {ligamenta corruscantia), which pass from one cartilage to the other.LIGAMENTS OF THE STEENUM. 193 The ninth and tenth are connected at their extremity by liga- mentous fibres, but have no synovial membrane. Actions. The movements of the chondro-sternal articulations are very trifling, being limited to a slight degree of gliding motion. The first rib is the least, the second the most movable. 8. ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS WITH THE COSTAL CARTI- LAGES.â€”The anterior extremity of each rib is excavated, so as to receive the convex outer end of the costal cartilage ; there is no true ligament, but the periosteum is prolonged on the cartilage, and takes the place of one. No motion takes place at this articulation. 9. ARTICULATIONS OF THE STERNUM. â€” The pieces of the sternum are connected by means of a thin plate of interosseous cartilage placed between each, and by an anterior and posterior ligament. The fibres of the anterior sternal ligament are longi- tudinal in direction, but so blended -nath the anterior chondro-sternal ligaments and tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoral muscles, as scarcely to be distinguished as a distinct ligament. The posterior sternal ligament is a broad smooth plane of longitudinal fibres, placed on the posterior surface of the bone, and extending from the manubrium to the ensiform cartilage. These ligaments contribute very materially to the strength of the sternum and elasticity of the front of the chest; their continuation downwards on the ensiform cartilage constitutes the sterno-xyphoid ligaments. 10. ARTICULATION OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN WITH THE PELVIS.â€”The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the sacrum by the same ligaments as those with which the various vertebrae are connected to each other : viz., anterior and posterior common liga- ment, intervertebral substance, ligamenta subflava, capsular liga- ments, interspinous and supraspinous ligament. There are, however, tivo proper ligaments connecting the vertebral column with the pelvis ; these are the Sacro-lumbar, Ilio-lumbar. The sacro-lumbar or sacro-vertebral ligament is a thick triangular fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, connected above with the lower and front part of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and below with the uj^per border of the sacrum, becoming blended with the anterioi' sacro-iliac ligament. The ilio lumbar ligament passes from the apex of the transverse j)rocess of the last lumbar vertebra to that part of the crest of the ilium which surmounts the sacro-iliac articulation. It is triangular : in form, and gives origin to the quadratus lumborum and a few ' fibres of the iliacus muscle. 11. ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS.â€”The ligaments of the I articulations of the pelvis are divisible into four groups : (i) Those t connecting the sacrum, and ilium; (2) those passing between the sacrum and ischium; (3) between the sacrum and coccyx; and (4) ) between the two puhic bones.

Anterior i^ubic, Superior luibic, Posterior jDubic, Sub-pubic, Interosseous fibro-cartilage. I. Between the Sacrum and Ilium.â€”This joint is commonly known as the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, but is sometimes called the sacro-iliac symphysis; it belongs to the class amphi-arthrosis. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of numerous short ligamentous bands and fibres, which j^ass from bone to bone on the anterior surface of the joint. The posterior sacro-iliac or interosseous ligament is composed of numerous strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which pass horizontally be- tween the rough surfaces of the posterior half of the sacro-iliac articulation, and constitute the principal bond of connection between the sacrum and ilium. They are lodged in the hollow between the posterior surface of the sacrum and the back- ward projection of the ilium. One fasciculus of this ligament, longer and larger than the rest, is distinguished, from its direc- tion, by the name of oblique sacro-iliac ligament. It is attached, by one extremity, to the pos- terior superior spine of the ilium ; and, by the other, to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum. The surfaces of the two bones forming the sacro-iliac articulation are partly connected by cartilage, and partly rough and connected by the interosseous ligament.

In some instances there are two plates of cartilage with a small cavity be- tween them, and this arrangement is more common in the female than in the male. 2. Between the Sacrum and Ischium. â€” The anterior or lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament is thin and triangular in form ; it is attached by its ajDex to the spine of the ischium, and by its broad extremity to the side of the sacrum and coccyx, interlacing its fibres with the greater sacro-ischiatic ligament. By its upper border it forms part of the lower boundary of the great sacro- isclriatic foramen, and by the lower, j^art of the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. The posterior or greater sacro-ischiatic ligament, larger, thicker, and posterior to the preceding, is narrower in the middle #1 Fig. i6i.â€”Lipraments of the pelvis and hip-joint, late- ral view. I.

It is pierced by theLIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 196 The posterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and con- nects the saci'um with the coccyx i^osteriorly, extending as far as the apex oi tlie latter hone. It is a direct continuation of the posterior common ligament, and becomes connected with the termination of Fig. 162.â€”Ligaments of pelvis and hip-joint, i. Posterior sacro-iliao ligament. 2.

The articulation admits of a certain degree of mo^â– ement backward.s during parturition. The ligaments connecting the different pieces of the coccyx con- sist of a few scattered anterior and posterior fibres, and a thin disc of interosseous cartilage ; the latter exists only in the young subject, as, in the adult, the pieces become ossified. 4. Between the Pubic Bones.â€”This articulation receives the name of symphysis pubis ; it is an exanqjle of an amphi-arthrodial joint. The anterior pubic ligament is composed of ligamentous fibres, 5 6LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. I97 â– which, pass obliquely across the union of the two bones from side to side, and form an interlacement in front of the symphysis. The posterior pubic ligament consists of a few irregular bands of fibres uniting the pubic bones posteriorly. The superior pubic ligament is a thick band of fibres connecting the angles of the pubes superiorly, and filling the inequalities of the surface of the bones. The sub-pubic ligament is a thick arch of fibres connecting the two bones inferiorly, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. The interosseous fibro-cartilage unites the two surfaces of the pubic bones in the same manner as the intervertebral substance con- nects the bodies of the vertebrae. It resembles the intervertebral substance also in being composed of oblique fibres disposed in con- centric layers, which are more dense towards the surface than near the centre. It is thick in front, and thin behind ; and a synovial membrane is found in the upper and posterior j)art of the articulation. This articulation becomes movable towards the latter term of pregnancy, and admits of a slight degree of separation of its sur- faces. The obturator membrane is not a ligament of articulation, but simply a ligamentous membrane stretched across the obturator fora- men. It gives attachment by its surfaces to the two obturator muscles, and leaves a space in the upper part of the foramen for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The ligaments of the upper extremity may be arranged in the order of the articulations of the difterent bones ; they are :â€” 1. Sterno-clavicular articula- 8.

STERNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION.â€”The sterno-clavicu- lar is an arthrodial articulation ; its ligaments are :â€” Anterior sterno-clavicular, Inter-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Costo-clavicular (rhomboid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad ligamen-198 STERNO-CLAVIOULAR ARTICULATION. â€” , ami ueiiiuu witu me mier- w nbro-caitilage and synovial membranes, posterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad baud g the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and synovial membranes ; and behind, with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscle. The anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaments, together with a few short fibres connecting the bones above, are sometimes described as forming one ligament, which is then called capsular. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely adherent to the upper border of the sternum. The costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament is a thick fasciculus of fibres, connecting the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the cartilage of the first rib. It is placed obliquely between the rib and under surl'ace of the clavicle ; and is in relation, in front, with the tendon of origin of the subclavius muscle, and behind with the subclavian vein. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the edges than in the centre. It is attached above, to the clavicle ; below, to the cartilage of the first rib ; and through- out the rest of its circumference, to the anterior and posterior sterno- clavicular ligaments. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are lined by separate synovial membranes; is sometimes pierced through its centre, and not unfrequently deficient, to a greater or less extent, at its lower part. . One of the synovial cavities lies between the end of the clavicle and interarticular cartilage, the other between the sternum and the cartilage ; the former is more loose than the latter. Actions.â€”The movements of the sterno-clavicular articulation areâ€”a gliding movement of the clavicle on tlie fibro-cartilage, or of the latter on the sternum, in the directions forward, backward, upward, and downward ; and circumduction. The upward and downward movements take place between the clavicle and inter- FiG. 163.â€”Ligaments of the ster- no-clavicular iind chondro-sternal articulations, i.

The upward movement is limited by the rhomboid ligament, the down- ward movement by the inter-clavicular ligament. This articulation is the centre of the movements of the shoulder. 2. SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION.â€”The ligaments of the scapular end of the clavicle are :â€” Superior acromio-clavicular. Inferior acromio-clavicular, Coraco-clavicular (trapezoid and conoid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The superior acromio-clavicular ligament is a moderately thick plane of fibres passing be- tween the extremity of the clavicle and the acromion, on the upper surface of the joint. It is strengthened by the tendinous fibres of the trapezius and deltoid, and on its deep surface is connected with the inter- articular cartilage. The inferior acromio- clavicular ligament is a thin plane situated on the under surface. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a capsule around the articu- lation. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is often indistinct, from having partial connections with the cartilaginous surfaces of the- two bones between which it is placed, and is fre(|uently absent. When partial, it occupies the j upper part of the articula- > tion. The synovial mem- branes are thin ; and when \ the fibro-cartilage is in- ' complete, there is but one. The coraco-clavicular ligament is a thick fasciculus of ligamen- FiG. 164.â€”Ligaments of the scapula and shoulder- joint. I. Superior acromio-clavicular ligament. 2.

It is divisible into two parts, an anterior and external called" trapezoid, and a posterior and internal called conoid. The trapezoid portion is seen best from the front; it is attached below to the upper surface of the coracoid process and above to the oblique line on the under surface of the clavicle ; its anterior border is free, its posterior joins with the conoid portion. The conoid ligament has its base directed upwards and attached to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle ; its apex is inserted into a rough process at the base of the coracoid process of the scapula. Actions.â€”The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two movements, gliding of the surfaces on each other, and rotation of the scapula on the extremity of the clavicle, the extent of this rotation being limited by the two parts of the coraco-clavicular ligament. Bursas.â€”There are commonly three bursse in connection with this articulation ; one in the recess between the trapezoid and conoid ligaments, one between the base of the coracoid process and apex of the conoid ligament, and the third between the coraco-acromial liga- ment and the capsule of the shoulder-joint. 3. The PROPER LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA are :â€” Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament is a broad and thick triangular band, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder-joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion process, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the clavicle and under surface of the deltoid muscle ; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually interposed. The transverse or coracoid ligament (supra-scapular) is a narrow but strong fasciculus which crosses the notch in the upper border of the scapula, from the base of the coracoid process, and converts it into a foramen. The supra-scapular nerve passes through this foramen, the artery and veins over it. The omo-hyoid muscle takes origin from this ligament. Movements of the Scapula.â€”The mobility of the scapula is very great; it takes place in upward, downward, forward, and backward directions, and by a combination of all these as a modified circumduction. In the forward and backward movements the scapula glides over the chest wall, carrying the clavicle with it, and bein? kept in apposition with the chest by the latissimus dorsi muscle. "^In raising the arm at the shoulder, the deltoid and supra- spinatus can only raise it to a right angle with the trunk ; elevation above that is effected by the rotation of the scapula on the chest wall by the trapezius, the glenoid cavity being directed upwards and forwards. The rotation movement commences at the very beginning201 SHOULDEK-JOINT. of lifting the arm, and not (as was formerly supposed) when the arm has i cached the level of the shoulder. 4. SHOULDER-JOINT.â€”The scapulo-humeral articulation is an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint; its ligaments are :â€” Capsular, Coraco-humeral, Glenoid, Gleno-humeral. The capsular ligament encloses the articulating head of the scapula and head of the humerus, and is attached above to the neck of the scapula externally to the glenoid ligament, and to the root of the coracoid process ; on the humerus it is attached to the upper half of the anatomical neck, but below it passes farther from the articular surface, some of its deeper fibres being, however, reflected upwards to terminate at the articular margin, much in the same way as fibres are reflected on the neck of the femur in the hip. It is thick above, where resistance is most required, and strengthened by the tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles : below it is thin and loose. The tendons of all the muscles in contact with the capsule except the subscapu- laris can be readily separated from it by careful dissection, but the latter either has beneath it a bursa which communicates with the cavity of the joint, or is itself united with the capsule and lined by the synovial membrane of the articulation. The coraco-humeral ligament is a broad band which descends obliquely outwards from the border of the coracoid process to the greater tuberosity of the hume- rus, and serves to strengthen the superior and anterior part of the capsular ligament; it assists the latter in bridging over the bicipital groove. The gleno-humeral ligament (ligament of Flood) is an acces- sory slip of fibres which projects into the joint along the inner edge of the biceps tendon, and is inserted into the upper part of the bicipital groove. It is supposed to be the homologue of the ligamentum teres in the hip-joint. The glenoid ligament is the prismoid band of fibro-cartilage, which is attached around the margin of the glenoid surface for the purpose of protecting its edge and deepening its cavity. It divides superiorly into two slips which are continuous with the long tendon of the biceps ; Fig. 165.â€”Section through the shoulder- joint. I. The cut end of the clavicle. 2.

The cavity of the articulation is traversed by the long tendon of the bicej^s, which is enclosed in a sheath of synovial membrane in its passage through the joint. The synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint is extensive ; it communicates anteriorly through an opening in the capsular ligament with a large bursal sac, which lines the under surface of the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Superiorly it frequently communicates through another opening in the capsular ligament with a bursal sac belonging to the infra-spinatus muscle ; and it moreover forms a sheath around that portion of the tendon of the biceps which is included within the joint. Capsular Muscles.â€”The muscles immediately surrounding the shoulder-joint areâ€”the subscapularis, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, long head of the triceps, and deltoid; the long tendon of the biceps is within the capsular ligament. Actions.â€”The shoulder-joint is capable of every variety of motionâ€”viz., of movement forwards and backwards, of abduction and adduction, of circumduction and rotation. The great freedom of movement which this joint enjoys depends on the laxity of the capsule and the large size of the head of the humerus in comparison with the depth of the glenoid cavity. The capsule is so loose that if an opening be made in it the humerus will fall about an inch from the scapula, showing that the articular surfaces are not kept in con- tact by the fibres of the capsule, but by atmospheric pressure. Bursse.â€”The bursae in connection with this joint are four in number : one between the subscapularis tendon and the capsule and neck of the scapula ; a second one between the capsule and the tendon nearer to the insertion of the latter; a third between the tip of the coracoid process and the capsule; and a fourth between the combined origins of the biceps and coraco-brachialis and the capsule. Nerve-supply.â€”Branches of the circumflex and supra-scapular nerves. 5. ELBOW-JOINT.â€”The elbow is a ginglymus or hinge-joint; and its ligaments four in number, namely :â€” Anterior, Internal lateral, Posterior, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer, descending from the anterior surface of the humerus immediately above the coronoid and radial fossa? to the coronoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament. It is connected on each side with the lateral ligaments, and is composed of fibres which pass in three different directions, vertical, transverse, and oblique, the latter being extended downwards and outwards to the orbicular ligament, into which they are inserted inferiorly. This ligament is covered in by the brachialis anticus muscle.203 ELBOW-JOINT. The posterior ligament is a broad and loose layer passing trans- versely across the olecranon fossa, and from the sides of the fossa to the base of the olecranon ; it is connected at each side with the lateral ligaments. It is covered in by the tendon of the triceps. The internal lateral ligament is a thick triangular layer, attached above, by its apex, to the internal condyle of the humerus ; and below, by its expanded border, to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, extending from the coronoid process to the olecranon. At its insertion it is intermingled with some trans- verse fibres; and posteriorly is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The external lateral ligament is a strong and narrow band which descends from the ex- ternal condyle of the humerus, to be inserted into the orbicular ligament and the ridge on the ulna with which the posterior part of the latter ligament is connected. The ligament is closely united with the tendon of origin of the supinator brevis muscle. The four Fig. 166.â€”Lig.aments of the elbow-joint, inner side. i. An- terior ligament. 2.

Nerves.â€”The chief supply of the joint is derived from the ulnar nerve, but it also receives twigs from the muscular-cutaneous and median. Actions,â€”The movements of the elbow-joint are flexion and extension. These movements are oblique, so that the forearm is inclined inwards in flexion and outwards in extension. Flexion is limited by the meeting of the soft parts of the arm and forearm, and extension by the muscles and ligaments on the front of the joint becoming tense ; these effects being produced before the coro- noid and olecranon processes reach the bottom of their respective fossae. Bursae.â€”The bursae in connection with this joint are only three in number : the first of these lies between the tendons of the ex- tensor carpi radialis brevior and extensor communis digitorum, and the external lateral ligament; the second between the olecranon and posterior ligament; and the third between the olecranon and the superficial structures. 6. RADIO ULNAR ARTICULATION.â€”The radius and ulna are firmly held together by ligaments, connected with both extremities of the bones, and with the shaft; they are :â€” Orbicular, Anterior inferior radio-ulnar. Oblique, Posterior inferior radio-ulnar. Interosseous, Interarticular fibro-cartilage. The orbicular ligament (annular, coronary) is a firm band, several lines in breadth, which surrounds the head of the radius, and is attached by each end to an extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity. Some of the lower fibres are continued round beneath the sigmoid cavity so as to form a complete circle. It is strongest behind w^here it receives the external lateral ligament, and is lined on its inner surface by a reflection of the synovial membrane of the elbow'- joint; it gives attachment to fibres of the supinator brevis muscle. The oblique ligament is a narrow slip of ligamentous fibres, descending obliquely from the base of the coronoid process of the ulna to the inner side of the radius, a little below its tuberosity. Its fibres run in the opposite direction to those of the interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane is a broad and thin plane of apo- neurotic fibres passing obliquely downwards from the sharp ridge on the radius to that on the ulna. It is deficient superiorly, broader in the middle than at each extremity, and perforated at its lower part for the passage of the anterior interosseous artery. The pos- terior interosseous artery passes backwards between the oblique ligament and upper border of the interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane affords an extensive surface for the attachment of muscles ; and is in relation, in front, with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus poUicis, pronator quadratus, andRADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION. 205 anterior interosseous arlery and nerve ; behind, with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, extensor indicis, and near the wrist with the anterior interosseous artery and posterior in- terosseous nerve. The anterior inferior radio-ulnar ligament is a thin band of fibres, passing transversely between the anterior surface of the lower end of the radius and ulna. The posterior inferior radio-ulnar liga- ment, also thin and loose, has the same dis- position on the posterior surface of the articu- lation. The triangular interarticular fibro-carti- lage acts the part of a ligament between the lower extremity of the radius and ulna. It is inserted by its apex into a depression on the inner surface of the styloid process of the ulna, and attached by its base to the edge of the radius. This fibro-cartilage is lined on the upper surface by a synovial membrane, which forms a remarkably loose capsule between the radius and ulna, and is called the membrana sacciformis. By its lower surface it enters into the articulation of the wrist-joint. Actions.â€”The movements taking place between the radius and ulna areâ€”rotation of the former upon the latter, rotation forwards being termed pronation, and rotation backwards sivpination; in the former the palm of the hand comes to be directed downwards, in the latter it looks upwards. In these movements the head of the radius turns upon its axis, within its orbicular ligament and lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna ; while inferiorly, the radius presents a concavity whicli moves on the rounded head of the ulna. The ulna also moves, although in much less degree, in a direction opposite to that of the radius; this movement depends chiefly on rota- tion at the shoulder-joint, and to some extent on a laxity of the elbow-joint. The movements of the radius are chiefly limited by the anterior and posterior inferior ligaments ; hence these are not unfrequently ruptured in great muscular efforts. 7- WRIST-JOINT.â€”The wrist is a condyloid articulation; the articular surfaces entering into its formation being the radius and Fig. 168.â€”Upper part of ulna and orbicular ligameut. i.

The anterior ligament is a broad and membranous layer consist- ing of three fasciculi, which pass downwards and inwards between the anterior margin of the lower end of the radius and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones. It is pierced by numerous small openings for vessels, and has lying in front of it the tendons of the flexor profundus digito- rum and flexor longus pollicis. The posterior ligament, also thin and loose, passes down- wards and inwards between the posterior surface of the radius and the posterior surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cunei- form bones. The internal lateral liga- ment extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cunei- form and pisiform bones. The external lateral liga- ment is attached by one ex- tremity to the styloid process of the radius, and by the other to the side of the scaj^hoid bone, Fi<5.170.â€”I. Radius. 2.

ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN THE CARPAL BONES.â€”These ire arthrodial joints, with the exception of the conjoined head ot ihe OS magnuni and unciform, which is received into a cup formed by the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone, and constitutes an ^narthrosis. The ligaments are :â€” Dorsal, Interosseous fibro-cartilages, Palmar, Annular. The dorsal ligaments are ligamentous bands that pass trans- versely and longitudinally from bone to bone on the dorsal surface of the carpus. The palmar ligaments are fasciculi of the same kind, but stronger than the dorsal, having the like disposition on the palmar surface. The interosseous ligaments are fibro-cartilaginous lainellse situated between the adjoining bones in each range : in the upper range they close the upper part of the space between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones ; in the lower range they are stronger than in the upper, and connect the os magnum on the one side to the unciform, on the other to the trapezoid, leaving intervals through which the synovial membrane is continued to the bases of the meta- carpal bones. The anterior annular ligament is a firm ligamentous band, which connects the bones of the two sides of the carpus. It is attached by one extremity to the trapezium and scaphoid, by the other to the unciform process of the unciform and base of the pisi- form bones, and forms an arch over the anterior surface of the carpus, beneath which the tendons of the long flexors and the median nerve pass into the palm of the hand. The posterior annular ligament is a flattened band of fibrous tissue about half an inch in breadth, passing across from the lower end and styloid process of the radius to the cuneiform, pisiform, and base of the fifth metacarpal. It assists the posterior ligament of the wrist-joint in binding the] hand to the forearm, and in carry- ing the hand with the radius in pronation. A more complete de- scription of this ligament and the preceding will be found in the section on the muscles and fasciae. The articulation of the pisiform bone with the cuneiform is provided with a separate synovial membrane, protected by fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which form a kind of capsule around the joint, and are inserted into the cuneiform bone. This bone is also connected with the unciform and base of the metacarpal of the little finger by two strong fibrous bands. Synovial Cavities.â€”There are Jive synovial cavities between the articulations of the carpus :â€” The first is situated between the lower end of the ulna and the2o8 CARPO-METACAKPAL ARTICULATIONS. interarticular ftbro-cartilagc ; it has been described above, and is called sacciform, on account of forming a sacculus between the ulna and radius. The second is situated between the lower surface of the radius and interarticular fibro-cartilage above, and the first range of bones of the carpus below. The third, the most extensive of the synovial cavities of the wrist, is situated between the two rows of carpal bones, and passes between the bones of the first and between those of the second range, also between the carpal extremities of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers. The fourth is the synovial cavity of the articulation of the meta- carpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. The fifth is situated between the pisiform and cuneiform bones. Actions.â€”Very little movement exists between the bones in each range, but more is permitted between the two ranges. The most important movements are flexion and extension, but there is also a slight amount of lateral motion and of rotation in the medio-carpal articulation. The rotation takes place by the head of the os magnum and upper outer angle of the unciform moving in the socket formed by the three outer bones of the first row, together with some gliding backwards and forwards of the trapezium and trapezoid on the scaphoid. 9.

The palmar ligaments are thin fasciculi arranged according to the same' plan on the palmar surface, but the third metacarpal has three slips, one from the ridge on the trapezium, one from the os magnum, and one from the unciform. The synovial cavity is a continuation of the great synovial cavity of the two rows of carpal bones. The capsular ligament of the thumb is one of the three true capsular ligaments of the skeleton ; the other two being the shoidder and hip. The articulation has a special synovial membrane. The metacarpal bones of the four fingers are firmly connected at their bases by means of dorsal and palmar ligaments, wdiich extend transversely from one bone to the other, and by interosseous liga- ments which pass between their contiguous surfaces. Their lateral articular facets are lined by a reflection of the great synovial mem- brane of the two rows of carpal bones. Actions.â€”The movements of the metacarpal on the carpal bones are restricted to a slight degree of gliding motion, with the excep- tion of the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. In the latter, the movements are flexion, extension^ adduction, obdAidion, and circumduction. 10. METACARPO-PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS.â€”The meta- carpo-phiilangeal articulation is a condyloid joint; and its ligaments four in number :â€” Anterior, Two lateral, Transverse. The anterior ligaments (glenoid), thick and fibro-cartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joints. They are grooved on their palmar surface for the lodgment of the flexor tendons, and by their deep aspect form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone. At each side they are continuous with the lateral ligaments. The lateral ligaments are strong narrow fasciculi, holding the bones together at each side. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band passing across the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fino-ers and connected with the anterior ligaments. Â° ' The expansion of the extensor tendon over the back of the fingers takes the place and performs the oflice of a posterior ligament. Actions.â€”The cliief motions which this articulation admits of 0210 AKTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. are Jlexion and extension. When the finger is extended the lateral ligaments are in a condition of relaxation, and adduction, abduction, and circumduction take place ; when, however, the finger is flexed, Fig. 172. â€” Lateral and anterior liga- ments of meta- carpo - i)lialan(ieal and interphalan- geal joints ; show- ing their condition during flexion. 1, 1, I.

ARTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES.â€”These articulations are ginglymus joints ; and furnished with three ligaments :â€” Anterior, Two lateral. The anterior ligament, firm and fibro-cartilaginous, forms part of the articular surface for the head of the phalanges ; Avhile exter- nally it is grooved for the reception of the flexor tendons. The lateral ligaments are very strong, and the j)rincipal bond of connection between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the ofiice of a posterior ligament. Actions.â€”The movements of the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension, these movements being more free between the first and second than between the second and third. LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The ligaments of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be arranged in the order of the joints to which they belong ; these are :â€” 1. Hip-joint. 2. Knee-joint. 3. Articulations between the tibia'and fibula. 4. Ankle-joint. 5. Articulations of the tarsal bones, 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulations. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal articulations. 8. Articulations of the phalanges. I. HIP-JOINT.â€”The articulation of the head of the femur with 1 lie acetabulum constitutes an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint.211 HIP-JOINT. The articular surfaces areâ€”the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabu- lum and the rounded head of the femur ; the ligaments are five in number, viz. :â€” Capsular, Teres, Ilio-femoral, Cotyloid, Transverse. The capsular ligament (Fig. i6o, 8) is a strong ligamentous capsule embracing the acetabulum superiorly, the neck of the femur below, and connecting the two bones firmly together. The pelvic origin of the fibres extends superiorly as high as the base of the anterior inferior iliac spine, posteriorly it is connected with the ilium and ischium only a few lines from the margin of the acetabulum, inferiorly it is attached to the outer lip of the groove between the ischial tuberosity and acetabulum, while in front it springs from the transverse ligament, the pubes near the notch, and tbe pectineal eminence. On the femur the capsule gets attached in front to the spiral line, above to the base of the great trochanter, behind to the junction of the middle and outer thirds of the neck, and reaches below to within three-quarters of an inch of the lesser trochanter. The capsule is composed of longitudinal and circular fibres ; the former are chiefly found on the front, and the latter are most numerous on the back. The longitudinal fibres at the back of the capsule are almost entirely confined to the surface next the synovial membrane ; after running outwards for some distance they are re- flected along the neck of the femur to the articular margin ; from their close connection with the bone they often prevent the separa- tion of the fragments in intracapsular fracture of the neck, and liave received the name of retinaada. The capsule receives strengthening bands from the tendons of the rectus, ilio-psoas, gluteus minimus, and obturator externus. The ilio-femoral ligament is the chief accessory band of the capsule. It is placed anteriorly, and is connected above with the ilium immediately below and behind the anterior inferior spine ; it is attached below to the front of the great trochanter and spiral line as far as the inner border of the shaft of the femur. 'Jlie fibres at the inner and outer borders of this ligament are thicker than the middle ones, and as they diverge from each other they present the appear- ance of an inverted Y; hence this ligament has been described by Bigelow under the name of the Y-shaped ligament: it must, how- ever, be borne in mind that the interspace between the two limbs is filled in_ by radiating fibres, so that strictly no true Y-shaped liga- ment exists. Other accessory bands of fibres exist on the superior, inferior, and anterior aspects of the capsule ; these have been named respectively, ilio-trochanteric, ischio-capsiUar, and imho-femoral liga- ments. The ligamentum teres (Fig. i6i, 7), trian^ular in shape, is attached by a round apex to the depression just below the middle of the head of the femur, and by its base, which separates into two fasciculi, into212 HIP.JOINT. the borders of the notch of the acetabulum, wliere it is connected with the transverse ligament. It is formed by a fasciculus of fibres of variable size, surrounded by synovial memln-ane ; sometimes the synovial membrane is present without the fibres, or the ligament is wholly absent. The round ligament limits adduction in ihe flexed position, and thus resists dislocation of the head of the femur on to the dorsum of the ilium ; it also limits external rotation when the limb is partly flexed. The cotyloid ligament (Fig, i6i, 6) is a prismoid cord of fibro- cartilage, attached around the margin of the acetabulum, and serving to deepen that cavity and protect its edges. It is thicker at the upper and posterior border of the acetabulum than in front, is inclined inwards towards the acetabulum, and consists of fibres which arise from the whole circumference of the brim, and interlace with each o,ther at acute anojles. The transverse ligament is a strong fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, continuous wiih the cotyloid li<^ament, and stretching across the notch of the acetabulum. It converts the notch into a foramen, through which the articular branches of the internal circumflex and obturator artery enter the joint. The fossa at the bottom of the acetabulum is filled with a mass of fat, covered by synovial membrane, which .serves as an elastic cushion for the head of the bone during its movements. This was described by HaA^ers as the synovial gland. The synovial membrane is extensive ; it commences at the mai'gin of the head of the femur, and is continued around the liga- mentum teres to the acetabulum, whence it is reflected on the inner surface of the capsular ligament back to the head of the bone. Capsular Muscles.â€”The muscles immediatelj^ surrounding and in contact with the hip-joint areâ€”in front, psoas and iliacus, sepa- rated from the capsular ligament by a large synovial bursa ; above, short head of the rectus and gluteus minimus ; hehhid, pyrifor- mis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, and quadratus femoris; and at the inner side, obturator externus and pectineus. Actions.â€”The movements of the hip-joint are very extensive : they are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. When the knee is fle.xed, flexion of the hip-joint is limited only by the contact of the thigh with the abdominal wall, but when the "knee is extended the ham-string muscles check the movement in most persons when the leg forms an angle of 75Â° with the body. Extension is checked by the ilio-femoral ligament; rotation outwards by the outer part of the ilio-femoral ligament and ligamentum teres ; rotation inwards by the back part of the capsule, the ischio-capsular ligament, and the muscles at the back of the joint. Adduction is limited by the ilio-femoral ligament and upper part of capsule ; abduction by the pubo femoral band and lower part of capsule. Nerve-supply. â€” Obturator, accessory obturator, and anterior213 KNEE-JOINT. crural from the lumbar plexus ; branches of the great sciatic, and of the nerve to the quadratus femoris, from the sacral plexus. Bursse.â€”Nine bursse are found in the neighbourhood of the hip- joint, five in front and four behind. Those on the front are as follows :â€”One of large size between the ilio-psoas tendon and the capsule, which often communicates with the cavity of the joint; another between the tendon of the gluteus medius and the great trochanter ; a third between the gluteus minimus and the great trochanter ; a fourth between the gluteus maximus and vastus ex- ternus ; and a fifth of large size and often multilocular between the gluteus maximus and great trochanter. The bursas situated at the back of the joint are :â€”One beneath the tendon of the obturator externus, another between the quadratus femoris and great tro- chanter, a third between the capsule and common tendon of the obturator internus and genielli, and a fourth between the quadratus femoris, obturator externus, and the back part of the capsule. 2. KNEE-JOINT.â€”The knee is a ginglymus articulation of large size, and provided with numerous ligaments ; the latter may be divided into an external and an internal set. External ligaments. ^Anterior or ligamentuni patellae. Posterior or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, Internal lateral, I Two external lateral, I Capsular ligament, 'Anterior or external crucial. Posterior or internal crucial. Transverse, Internal ligaments. Ligamentum mucosum, } r , Two ligamenta alaria, hgaments. Two semilunar fibro-cartilages, Synovial membrane. The anterior ligament, or ligamentuni patellae, is the prolonga- tion of the tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh downwards to the tubercle of the tibia. Between the upper part of this liga- ment and the knee-joint a pad of fat is placed, and between its lower part and tlie tibia there is a synovial bursa. The posterior ligament, or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, IS a broad expansion of ligamentous fibres, which covers the whole of the posterior aspect of the joint. It is divisible into two lateral portions, which invest the condyles of the femur, and a central portion which is depressed, and formed by the interlacement of fasciculi passing in diflferent directions. The strongest of these fasciculi is derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, and passes obliquely upwards and outwards from the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condvle of the femur. Other accessory fasciculi are given off by the tendon of the popliteus214 KNEE-JOINT. and heads of the gastrociieiriius. The middle portion of the liga- ment supports tlie iiopliteal artery and vein, and is perforuled Ijy several openings for the passage of branches of the azygos articular artery and the nerves of the joint. The internal lateral ligament ligamentous fibres attached above is a broad and trapezoid layer of to the tubercle on tlie internal condyle of the femur, and below to the inner tuberosity and upper part of the shaft of the tibia. It is intimately connected with the edge of the internal semilunar cartilage and with the coronary ligament, and by its posterior edge becomes blended with the ligament of Winslow. It is crossed at its lower part by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, and has passing beneath it the anterior slip of the semi- membranosus tendon and the in- ferior internal articular artery. External Lateral Ligaments. â€”The long external lateral liga- ment is a strong and round cord, which descends from the pos- terior part of the tubercle on the external condyle of the femur to the outer part of the head of the fibula. It is covered in by the tendon of the biceps, and has passing beneath it the tendon of origin of the popliteus muscle, and the inferior external arti- cular artery. The short external lateral ligament is an irregular fasci- culus situated behind the pre- ceding, arising from the external condyle near the origin of the head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and inserted into the middle of the outer surface of the head of the fibula. It is firmly connected with the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and appears principally intended to connect that cartilage with the fibula: sometimes it is lost superiorly in the capsular ligament without reaching the femur The capsular ligament consists of thin fibres which fill up the interval left between the patella in the centre and the lateral liga- FiG. 173.â€”Anterior view of the ligaments of the knee-joint, i.

They are intimately connected with the lateral expansions of the tendons of the vastus externus, vastus internus, and crureus, and receive additional fibres from the tendons of the biceps, semi- tendinosus, and sartorius. The true ligaments within the joint are the crucial, transverse, and coronary. The anterior or external crucial ligament arises from the depression on the head of the tibia in front of the spinous process, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the inner surface of the outer condyle of the femur, as far back as its posterior border. It is smaller than the posterior. The posterior or internal crucial ligament arises from the de^Dression on the head of the tibia behind the spinous process, and passes upwards and forwards to be inserted into the intercondylar hollow, and outer surface of the inner condyle of the femur. This li<^ament is less oblique and larger than the anterior. The anterior crucial ligament limits extension, and the posterior limits flexion ; they also limit rotation when the leg is flexed. The transverse ligament is a small slip of fibres which extends transversely from the external semilunar fibro-carti- lage, near its anterior extremity, to the anterior convexity of the internal cartilage. The coronary ligaments are the short fibres by which the convex borders of the semilunar cartilages are connected to the head of the tibia and ligaments surrounding the joint. The semilunar fibre-cartilages are two falciform plates of fibro- FiG. 174.â€”Posterior view of the ligaments of the knee-joint, i, i. Internal lateral liga- ment. 2. Longexternallateralligament. 3.

They are thick along their convex border ; thin and sharp along their concave edge. Each cartilage covers about two-thirds of the corresponding articular surface of the tibia, leaving the inner third uncovered ; both surfaces are covered by synovial membrane. The internal semilunar fibro-cartilage forms an oval cup for the reception of the internal condyle of the femur : it is connected by its convex border with the head of the tibia and internal and posterior ligaments, by means of its coronary ligament; and by its two extremities is firmly implanted into the depression before and behind the spinous process. The external semilunar fibro-carti- lage bounds a circular fossa for the external condyle ; it is connected by its convex bor- der with the head of the tibia, and to the external and posterior liga- ments by its coro- nary ligament; by its two extremi- ties it is inserted into th e depression between the two projections which constitute the spinous process of the tibia ; being placed between the attached ends of the internal cartilage. The two extremities of the external cartilage, being inserted into the same fossa, form an almost complete circle, and the cartilage, being somewhat broader than the internal, covers more of the articular surface of the tibia. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage, besides giving off a fasci- culus from its anterior border to constitute the transverse ligament, is continuous by some of its fibres with the extremity of the ante- rior crucial ligament: posteriorly it divides into three slips; one, a strong cord, ascends obliquely forwards to be inserted into the anterior part of the inner condyle of the femur in front of the pos- terior crucial ligament; another is the fasciculus of insertion into the fossa of the spinous process ; while the third, of small size, is continuous with the posterior part of the anterior crucial liga- ment. The ligamentum mucosum is a slender conical process of synovial membrane enclosing a few ligamentous fibres which proceed from the transverse ligament. It is connected, by its apex, with the Fig. 17s.â€”The right knee-joint laid open from the front in order to show the internal ligaments, i.

It also forms the folds in the interior of the joint, called " ligamentum mucosum " and " ligamenta alaria." Between the ligamentum patellae and synovial membrane is a considerable mass of fat, which presses the membrane towards the interior of the joint, and occupies the fossa between the condyles. Actions.â€”The knee-joint is one of the strongest of the articula- tions of the body, while, at the same time, it admits of the most perfect degree of movement in the direction of flexion and extension. During flexion the articular surface of the tibia glides forward on the condyles of the femur ; the lateral ligaments, the posterior ligament, and the anterior crucial ligament are relaxed ; while the ligamentum patella; being on the stretch, serves to press the adipose mass behind it into the vacuity formed in the front of the joint. In complete flexion the posterior crucial ligament is rendered tense,KNEE-JOINT. 2l8 but flexion is also limited during life by the contact of the leg with the thigh. In complete extension all the ligaments are put on the stretch, with the exception of the ligamentum patellae and the posterior crucial ligament. In the movements of flexion and ex- tension the patella in turn presents to the femoral surface each of the three facets into which the condylar surfaces of that bone are divided, this coaptation being associated with gliding. At the terniination of the act of flexion the patella rests with its inner vertical facet (seventh facet) against the outer part of the internal condyle, and its upper and outer facet against the front of the external condyle. At the end of extension the external condyle reaches its resting position before the internal, so that the latter continues to move backwards, thus rotating the femur inwards upon the tibia. When the knee is semi-flexed, a partial degree of rotation is permitted. Bursse.â€”The bursse in the neighbourhood of the knee-joint are numerous and important; three large ones are placed in front, and numerous small ones at the back of the joint. Those in front are â€”first, one, large and superficial, placed between the patella and subcutaneous tissue, it is this which becomes enlarged in the disease known as "housemaid's knee;" second, one between the common extensor tendon and the lower part of the shaft of the femur, it frequently communicates with the synovial pouch of the joint; the third is placed between the ligamentum patellae and the head of the tibia ; it also, sometimes, communicates with the cavity of the joint. The bursa3 at the back of the joint are chiefly connected with the tendons of muscles ; the most important are the following :â€”One placed between the tendons of the semi-membranosus and inner head of the gastrocnemius and the internal condyle ; this is the largest bursa in the popliteal region, and extends from the posterior in- ferior part of the internal condyle to the back of the inner tubero- sity of the tibia as low down as the upper border of the popliteus muscle. A second bursa lies between the anterior surface of the semi-membranosus tendon and the inner tuberosity of the tibia. Other bursse exist, between the tendon of the popliteus and the external lateral ligament, between the same tendon and the outer tuberosity of the tibia, between the tendon of the biceps and the external lateral ligament, and beneath the outer head of the gas- trocnemius. Nerve-supply.â€”Branches of the obturator, anterior crural, ex- ternal and internal popliteal. 3. ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN THE TIBIA AND FIBULA.â€”The tibia and fibula are held firmly connected by means of seven liga- ments, namely : â€” Anterior, f ^ Anterior, K j Posterior, p""^^ Posterior, J Interosseous membrane, Transverse. Interosseous inferior,TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATIONS. 219 The anterior superior tibio-fibular ligament is a strong fasci- culus of parallel fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the outer tuberosity of the tibia to the anterior surface of the head of the fibula. The posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, thicker and stronger than the anterior, is disposed in a similar manner on the posterior surface of the joint. It is covered by the tendon of the popliteus. Within the articulation there is a synovial membrane which is sometimes continuous with that of the knee-joint. The interosseous membrane is a broad layer of aponeurotic fibres which pass obliquely downwards and outwards, from the sharp ridge on the tibia to the inner edge of the fibula, and are crossed by a few fibres taking the opposite direction. The liga- ment is deficient above, leaving a considerable interval between the bones, through which the anterior tibial artery takes its course forward to the anterior aspect of the leg; and per- forated beloiv, near its lower third, for the anterior peroneal artery and vein. The interosseous membrane is in relation, in front, with the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius hallucis, anterior tibial vessels and nerve, and anterior peroneal artery; behind, with the tibialis posticus, flexor longus hallucis, flexor longus digitorum, and posterior peroneal artery. The inferior interosseous ligament consists of short and strong fibres, which hold the bones firmly together inferiorly, where they are nearly in contact; it is continuous above with the interosseous membrane. This articulation is so firm, that the fibula is broken when an attempt is made to rupture the ligament. The anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament is a broad band, consisting of two fasciculi of parallel fibres which pass obliquely across the anterior aspect of the articulation of the two bones at their inferior extremity, from tibia to fibula. The posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament is a similar band on the posterior surface of the articulation. Both ligaments project somewhat below the margin of the bones, and serve to deepen the cavity of articulation with the astragalus. The transverse ligament is a narrow band of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the preceding, and passing transversely across the back of the ankle-joint between the two malleoli. 1<IG. 177.â€”Jr'osterior view of the ankle- joint.

Actions.â€”Between the tibia and fibula there' exists a slight degree of movement, which is calculated to enable the latter to resist injury by yielding ibr a trifling extent to forcible pressure. 4. ANKLE-JOINT.â€”The ankle is a ginglymus articulation ; the surfaces entering into its formation are the under surface of the tibia with Its malleolus and the malleolus of the fibula, above ; and the surface of the astragalus with its two lateral facets, below. The ligaments are four in number :â€” Anterior, Internal lateral. External lateral. Posterior. The anterior ligament is a thin membranous layer, passing from the margin of the tibia to the astragalus in front of its articular sur- FiG. 178.â€”Ligaments of inner side of ankle and foot. 1,2, 3, 4.

It is in relation, in front, with the tendons of the extensors of the great and lesser toes, tibialis auticus, peroneus tertius, and ante- rior tibial vessels and nerves. Posteriorly it lies in contact with a stratum of extra-synovial adipose tissue and the synovial membrane. The internal lateral or deltoid ligament is a triangular layer of fibres, attached superiorly, by its apex, to the internal malleolus ; inferiorly, by an expanded base, to the astragalus, os calcis, and scaphoid bones. Beneath the superficial layer of this ligament is a stronger and thicker fasciculus, which connects the apex of the internal malleolus with the side of the astragalus. The internal lateral ligament is covered iu and partly concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, and, at its posterior part, is in221 ANKLE-JOINT. relation with the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum and flexor lonsjus hallucis. . â€ž . The external lateral ligament consists of three strong fasciculi which proceed from the inner side of the external malleolus, and radiate in three different directions. The anterior fasciculus passes forward to be attached to the astragalus ; the posterior, backward, to be connected with the astragalus posteriorly ; and the middle, longer than the other two, descends to be inserted into the outer side of the 03 calcis. J 1 ii â€¢ The posterior ligament consists of a few scattered and tlim fibres which are attached above to the external malleolus, the back part of the lower end of the tibia, and to the posterior inferior tibio- fibular ligament, and below to the posterior surface of the astragalus, from the'external to the internal lateral ligaments. The synovial membrane is reflected upon the anterior and lateral Fig. 179.â€”Ligaments of outer side of ankle and foot. i. Anterior-inferior tibio- fibular ligament. 2.

Actions.â€”The movements are mainly those of^ea;io?i and extension, the latter being accompanied by a slight inward movement of the toes, in consequence of the outer border of the articular surface of the astragalus being longer than the inner. Both the cupped lower end of the tibia and the corresponding surface of the astragalus are wider in front than behind ; hence, in complete extension the narrow part of the latter comes to occupy the wide part of tlie former,ARTICULATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. 222 and a limited degree of lateral motion is thus allowed ; in flexion, on the other hand, they tit accurately to each other, thus securing that iixation so necessary to the erect posture. Bursae.â€”The bursas in connection with the ankle-joint are chiefly of the ensheathing or vaginal variety, and are continued for some distance along the tendons on the front and back of the joint. The annular ligament binding down the tendons in front of the joint is divided into three compartments, each of which has its special synovial sheath. The first gives passage to the tibialis anticus, the second to the extensor longus hallucis, and the third is common to the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius. Behind the ankle there is a bursa common to tlie two peronei muscles, one in the course of the flexor longus digitorum, and one in that of the tibialis jjosticus. Nerve-supply.â€”Branches of the anterior and posterior tibial nerves. 5. ARTICULATION OF THE TARSAL BONES.â€”The ligaments which connect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds :â€” Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are small fasciculi of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it articulates. The only dorsal ligaments deserving of particular men- tion are the external and posterior astragalo-calcaneal, which, with the interosseous ligament, complete the articulation of the astra- galus with the OS calcis; the superior and internal calcaneo-cuboid ligaments ; and the superior astragalo-scaphoid ligament. The internal calcaneo-cuboid, and superior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which are closely united posteriorly in the deep groove which inter- venes between the astragalus and os calcis, separate anteriorly to reach their respective bones ; they form the principal bond of con- nection between the first and second range of bones of the foot. It is the division of this j)ortion of these ligaments that demands the careful attention of the surgeon in performing Chopart's operation. The plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar surface of the foot; three of them, however, are of large size, and have especial names, viz., the Calcaneo-scaphoid, Long calcaneo-cuboid, Short calcaneo-cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament is a broad and fibro- cartilaginous band of ligament which passes forward from the an- terior and inner border of the os calcis to the edge of the scaphoid bone. Besides connecting the os calcis and scajihoid, it supports the astragalus, and forms part of the cavity in which the rounded head of t7ie latter bone is received. It is lined on its upper surface by the synovial membrane of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation.ARTICULATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. 223 This licrament is the main support of the arch of the foot, and is sometimes called the ''spring" ligament; it is braced up by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which runs beneath it. The firm connection of the os calcis with the scaphoid bone, and the feebleness of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, are conditions favourable to the occasional dislocation of the head of the astragalus. The long calcaneo-cuboid ligament or ligamentum longum plantse is a long band of ligamentous fibres, which proceeds from the under surface of the os calcis to the rough surface on the under part Fig. 180.â€”Ligaments of the sole of tlie foot.

This ligament forms the inferior boundary of the canal in the cuboid bone, through which the tendon of the peroneus longus passes to its insertion into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The short calcaneo-cuboid or ligamentum breve plantae is situated closer to the bones than the long plantar ligament, from which it is separated by adipose tissue ; it is broad and extensive, and ties the under part of the os calcis and cuboid bone firmly together. The interosseous ligaments are five in number ; they are short and strong ligamentous fibres situated between adjoining bones, and firmly attached to their rough surfaces. One of' these, astragala-224 SYNOVIAL CAVITIES OF THE TARSUS. calcaneal, is lodged in the groove between the upper surface of the OS calcis and the lower of the astragalus. It is large and very strong, consists of vertical and oblique fibres, and serves to unite the os calcis and astragalus solidly together. The second interosseous liga- ment, also very strong, is situated between the sides of the scaphoid and cuboid bone ; the three remaining interosseous ligaments con- nect strongly together the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid. Tlie synovial membranes of the tarsus are four in number : one, for the posterior astragalo-calcaneal articulation ; a second, for the anterior astragalo-calcaneal and astragalo-scaphoid articulation; oc- casionally an additional small synovial membrane is found in the Fig. i8i.â€”Diagram showing the arraugemeiit of the synovial lueinbraues of the tarsal joints, i.

The prolongation which reaches the metatarsal bones passes forward between the internal and middle cuneiform bone. The synovial membrane between the two outer cuneiform and second and third metatarsal bones is often distinct from the large one ; it is so represented in Fig. 181, vii. A small synovial membrane is sometimes met with between the contiguous surfaces of the scaphoid and cuboid bone. 4225 TAKSO-METATAKSAL ARTICULATION, Actions.â€”The movements permitted by the articulation between the astragalus and os calcis, are a slight degree of gliding, in the direction fonoards and backwards, and laterally from side to side. The movements of the second range of tarsal bones are very trifling, being greater between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones than in the other articulations. The movements occurring between the first and second range are the most considerable ; they are adduction and abdiLction; and, in a minor degree, flexion, which increases the arch of the foot, and extension, whicla flattens the arch. 6. TARSO-METATARSAL ARTICULATION.â€”The ligaments of this articulation are :â€” Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments connect the metatarsal to the tarsal bones, and the metatarsal bones with each other. The base of the second metatarsal bone, articulating with the three cuneiform bones, receives a ligamentous slip from each, while the rest articulating with a single tarsal bone receive only a single tarsal slip. The plantar ligaments have a similar disposition on the plantar surface. The interosseous ligaments are situated between the bases of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes ; also between the base of the second and third metatarsal bones and the internal and external cuneiform bones. The metatarsal bone of the second toe being implanted by its base between the internal and external cuneiform bones, is the most strongly articulated of all the metatarsal bones. This disposition must be recollected in amputation at the tarso-metatarsal articu- lation. The synovial membranes of the tarso-metatarsal articulation are three in number : one for the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; one for the second and third metatarsal bones, which is continuous with the great tarsal synovial membrane ; and one for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Actions.â€”The movements of the metatarsal on the tarsal bones and on each other are very slight; they are such only as contribute to the strength of the foot, by permitting a certain degree of yielding tu opposing forces. 7- METATARSO-PHALANGEAL ARTICULATION.â€”The ligaments of this articulation, like those between the first phalanges and meta- carpal bones of the hand, are :â€” Inferior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The inferior or plantar ligaments, thick and fibro-cartilaginous, iorm jjart of the articulating surface of the joint. The lateral ligaments, short and very strong, are situated one on each side of the joint. The transverse ligament is a strong band, which passes trans- versely between the plantar ligaments.ARTICULATION OF THE PHALANGES. 226 The expansion of the extensor tendon supyilies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions.â€”The movements of the first phalanges on the rounded heads of the metatarsal bones are, flexion, extension, adduction, and abdudian. 8. ARTICULATION OF THE PHALANGES.â€”The ligaments of the phalanges are the same as those of the fingers, and have the same disposition ; their actions are also similar. They are :â€” Inferior or plantar, and, Two lateral.227 PART IV. MYOLOGY. In this section will be described the arrangement, attachments, and actions of tlie voluntary muscles, and the disposition of the fascia) sujiporting or connected with them. MUSCLES present various modifications in the arrangement of their fibres in relation to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are longitudinal, and terminate at each extremity in tendon, the entire muscle being fusiform in shape ; in other situations they are disposed like the rays of a fan, converging to a tendinous jDoint, as the teuiporal, pectoral, glutei, &c., and constitute a radiate muscle. Again, they are penniform, converging like the barl)s of a feather to one side of a tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle, as in the peronei; or hipenniform, converging to both sides of the tendon. In other muscles the fibres pass obliquely from the surface of a tendinous expansion spread out on one side, to that of another extended on the opposite side, as in tlie semi-membranosus ; or, they are composed of ])ennil'orm or bipenniform fasciculi, as in tlie deltoid, and constitute a compound muscle. In the broad muscle the tendon is s]iread out so as to form an expansion, called apoimi7-osis. The muscles are all symmetrical, and, with tlie exceptic^n of the s[)hincters and diaphragm, are arranged in pairs. It is calcidated that they number about 240 pairs, and that the weight of the total mass of muscle is about 63 lbs. in a man whose total body-weight is 150 lbs. The nomenclature of muscles is generally derived from some prominent character which the muscle presents ; thus, some are named from their situation, as the tibialis, peroneus, brachialis, temporal ; others from their use, as the flexors, extensors, abductors, levators, tensors, sphincters, &c. Some again from their form, as the trapezius, triangularis, deltoid, rhomboid, scalene, orbicidaris, Â«S:c. ; and others from their direction, as the rectus, obliquus, trans- versalis, Â«S:c. Certain muscles have received names expressive of their attachments, as the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, &c. ; and others, of their divisions, as the biceps, triceps, digastricus, com- plexus, &c.228 FASCIJE. In the descviption of a muscle we express its attachment by the words "origin" and "insertion:" the term origin is geneVallv applied to the more lixed attachment, or to the point towards wliicli the motion is directed, while insertion is assigned to tlie more movable point. Where both ends are equally moval>le the term origin is given to the attachment nearest to the middle line of the body, and that farthest from the middle line is called the insertion. FASCIA {fascia, a bandage) is the name assigned to fibrous laminae of various extent and thickness, which are distributed through the different regions (jf the body, for the purpose of in- vesting or protecting the softer and more delicate organs. From a consideration of their structure, these fasciae may l^e arranged into two groups : areolo-fibrous fasciae, and aponeurotic fasciae. The areolo-fibrous or superficial fascia is the common sub- cutaneous investment of the entire body; it is situated immediately beneath the integument o\-er every part of the frame, and is the medium of connection between that layer and the deeper parts. It is composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and contains in its areolae an abundance of adipose tissue, constituting the imnniculm adijjosus. Fat is, however, absent from the subcutaneous tissue of the penis, scrotum, and eyelids. By dissection, the superficial fascia may be sepai'ated into two layers, between which are found the superficial or cutaneous vessels and nerves; as the superficial epi- gastric artery, saphena veins, radial and ulnar veins, superficial lymphatic vessels, and the cutaneous muscles, such as the platysma myoides. The deep layer of this fascia usually forms a moie distinct sheet than the sujjerficial, and is almost devoid of fat vesicles. The aponeurotic or deep fascia is the strongest kind of investing membrane ; it is composed of tendinous fibres, running parallel with each other, and connected by other fibres of the same kind passing in different directions, together with areolar tissue and fine elastic fibres. When freshly exposed, it is white, glistening, and iridescent, and is firm, unyielding, and but little elastic. It encloses and forms distinct sheaths to all the muscles and tendon.s. It is thick on the outer and least protected side of the limb, and thinner at its inner side. It is firmly connected to the bones, and to the ]H-ominent points of each region, as to the pelvis, knee, and ankle, in the lower ; and to the clavicle, scapula, elbow, and wrist, in the upper extremity. It assists the muscles in their action, by keeping up a tonic pressure on their surface ; aids materially in the circula- tion of the fluids ; and in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is a powerful protection to the structures which enter into the com- position of those regions. In some situations its tension is regulated by muscular action, as by the tensor \-aginaj fenioris and gluteus maximus in the thigh, by the biceps in the leg, and by the liiceps and palmaris longus in the arm ; in other situations it affords an extensive surface for the origin of the fibres of muscles.229 CEANIAL GROUP OF MUSCLES. The Muscles and Fascia may be arranged in conformity with the general division of the body intoâ€”i. Those of the head and neck, 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the npper extremity. 4. Tliose of the lower extremity. MUSCLES AND FASCIiE OF THE HEAD AND NECK. These admit of subdivision into those of the liead and face, and those of the neck. Muscles of the Head and i^'ace.â€”These muscles may l)e divided into groups corresponding witli the natural regions of the head and face ; the groups are eight in number, namely :â€” 1. Cranial groiip. 5. Nasal grouj). 2. Orbital group. 6. Superior lalnargi'oup. 3. Auricular group. 7. Inferior labial group. 4. Ocular group. 8. Maxillary group. I. Cranial Group.â€”Occipito-frontalis. Dissection.â€”The occipito-frontalis is to be dissected by making a longitudinal incision along the vertex of the head, from tlie root of the nose to tlie external occipital protuberance, and a second incision along the forehead and around the side of tlie head, to join the two extremities of the preceding. Dissect the integument and su])erficial fascia carefully outwards, beginning at tlie anterior angle of the tiajj, wliere the muscular fibres are thickest, and remove it altogether. Tliis dissection requires care ; for tlie muscle is A^ery thin, and with- out attention would be raised with the integument. Fascia.^â€”The superficial fascia forms a firm, dense layer, which is closely connected witli the integument and the surface of the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis ; behind it becomes continuous with the superficial fascia of the neck, and laterally it passes over tlie temporal aponeurosis, and may be traced nearly as far as the zygoma. It contains lietween its layers the muscles of the auricle, and the superficial vessels and nerves. There is no deep fascia on the face or head, nor is it required ; for here the muscles are closely applied against the bones, upon which they depend for support, whilst in the extremities the support is derived from the dense layer of fascia by which they are invested, and whicli forms for each muscle a distinct slieath. Tlie OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS is a broad musculo-aponeurotic layer, whicli covers the whole side of the vertex of tlie skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It consists of two fleshy bellies and an in- tervening tendinous aponeurosis. The occipital portion arises from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and from tlie mastoid portion of tlie temporal; its fibres pass upwards to be inserted into the posterior margin of the apo- neurosis. The frontal portion is thinner and ])aler than the occi- pital, but covers a larger extent of surface ; its fibres are continuous230 OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS. with those of the pyramidalis nasi, corrugator siipercilii, and orbi- cxilans palpebraiaini ; immediately above the root of the nose the fibres of the right and left muscles are united, but as they pass upwards a small angular interval is left between them; they are inserted into the anterior extremity of the aponeurosis. Most of the Irontal hbres have no bony attachment, but a few are connected with the internal angular process of the frontal bone. The epicranial aponeurosis of the two sides covers the whole of the vertex of the .skull, and terminates in front and behind in narrow processes interposed between the fleshy bellies ; it is attached posteriorly to tlie occipital protuberance and superior curved line, and receives iG. 182.â€”Muscles of the head and face.

Eelations.^â€”This muscle is in relation by its external surface the frontal and supraorlutal vessels, supraorbital and facial nerves, temporal vessels and auriculo-tera])oral nerve, occipital vessels and nerves, and integument, to which last it is closely adherent. Its under surface is attached to the jiericranium by a loose areolar tissue, which permits considerable movement. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior or occij)ital portion by the posterior auriculai"; frontal portion by the temporalâ€”both branches of tlie facial.231 ORBICULARIS PALPEBRARUM. Actions.â€”The occipital portion acting alone draws the scalp backwards. The frontal portion, if it has its fixed point above, draws the eyebrows upwards and produces transverse wrinkles in the forehead, as in expressing surprise, wonder, attention, or terror ; if its fixed point be below it draws forward the scalp. By the alternate action of the two portions the scalp is drawn to and fro on the underlying pericranium. 2. Orbital Group.â€” Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, Tensor tarsi. Dissection.â€”Great care is requisite in the dissection of the first of these muscles, from the total absence of sulocutaneous fat over the eyelids, and the extreme delicacy of the musciilar fibres which cover them. A hook should be introduced into the paljiebral fissure at the outer canthus, and one of the other hooks of the set fastened to the table, so as to put the eyelids slightly on the stretch ; an incision should be made along the margin of each lid, and the cut already made from the scalj) to the root of the nose should be carried onwards to the tip of that organ. The skin is now to be raised from the margin of the lids as a delicate layer not thicker than ordinary tissue-paper. In order completely to expose the orbicularis it will be necessary to make an additional incision, after the skin has been raised from the lids, from the outer canthus of the eye on to the lateral aspect of the head. ' The ORBICULARIS PALPEBRARUM is a spliincter muscle, sur- rounding the orbit and eyelids, and consists of two jiortions, external and internal. The external or orbital portion arises from a short tendon, tendo oculi, situated at the inner angle of the eye, and from the internal angular process of the frontal lione ; it encircles the orliit, and is inserted into the nasal process of the superior maxillary and lower border of the tendo oculi, some of its fibres being continuous with the upper segment. This poi'tion of the muscle becomes intimately l)lended with the occipito-frontalis and corrugator supercilii; it also sends off slips which communicate with the muscles of tlie upper lip. The internal or pal2)ehral jjortion forms a curved plane of fibres on the eyelids, thinner and paler than the orl)ital portion ; externally these fibres are attached to the external palpebral ligament and border of the orbit, some being continuous witli the orbital portion ; internally they are attached to the l)orders of the lacus lachrymalis and tendo oculi. The fibres of the palpebral i)ortion nearest the edges of the lids are thicker than the lest, and are termed ciliary. A few fibres placed Mdthin the line of the eyelashes and separated hj them from the rest of the orbicularis, have been described as a distinct muscle under the name of ciliary/ muscle of Riolan. The tendo oculi (internal tarsal liqament), about two lines in length and one in })readth, is attached by one end to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, close to the edge of the232 CORRUGATOR SUPERCILII, orbit ; the other end bifurcates to be inserted into the inner ex- tremities of the tarsal plates ; from its posterior aspect is given off a process which spreads over the lachrymal sac, and is attached to the crest of the lachrymal bone ; this is the i-eHected aponeurosis of the tendo oculi, and serves to protect the lachrymal sac. The external tarsal ligament is a thin band of fibres, con- necting the outer extremity of the eyelids with the malar bone. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface the muscle is closely ad- herent to the integument, from which it is separated on the eye- lids by a loose areolar tissue. By its deep surface it lies in contact, above, with the upper border of the orbit, corrugator supercilii muscle, frontal and supraorbital vessels, and supraorljital nerve ; below, with the lachrymal sac, levator labii superioris alajoue nasi, levator labii superioris proprius, zygomaticus major ana minor muscles, and malar bone ; externally, with the temporal fascia. On the eyelids it is in relation with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal plates, and by its ui^per border is connected with the occipito- frontalis. Nerve-supply.â€”Temporal and malar branches of the facial. The CORRUGATOR SUPERCILII is a small, narrow, and pointed muscle, situated immediately above the orbit, and beneath the upi)er segment of the orbicularis paljiebrarum. It arises from the innei- extremity of the superciliary ridge, and passes upwards and out- wards to 1)6 inserted into the under surface of the orbicularis pal- pebrarum. Some of the fibres pass through the orbicularis and are inserted into the skin. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the occipito-frontalis and orbicularis palpebrarum ; by its deep surface with the frontal bone and supra-trochlear nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”The facial nerve. The TENSOR TARSI (Horner's muscle) is a thin plane of mus- cular fibres, about three lines in breadth and six in length. It is hest dissected (after the dissection of the orbit has been comjileted) by separating the eyelids from the eye, and turning them over the nose without disturbing the tendo oculi ; then dissect away the small fold of mucous membrane called plica semilunaris, and some loose areolar tissue under which the muscle is concealed. It arises from the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and jjassing across the lachrymal sac, divides into two slijjs, which pass behind the lachrymal canals and become continuous with the margin of the orbicularis along the edges of the lids ; some few of its fibres being attached to the lachrymal canals as far as the puncta. Nerve-supply.â€”Infraorbital branch of facial. Actions.â€”The palpebral portion of the orbicularis acts involun- tarily in closing the lids, and from the greater curve of the upper lid, upon that principally. The entire muscle constitutes a sphinctei-, drawing at the same time, by means of its osseous attachment, the integument and lids inwards towards the nose. The corrugatores supei'ciliorum draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards, andEXTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE EAR. 233 produce the vertical wrinkles of the forehead. The tensor tarsi is an auxiliary to the orbicularis, and draws the extremities of the lachrymal canals inwards, so as to place the jiuncta in the best position for receiving the tears. It compresses the lachrymal sac, and serves also to keep the lids in relation with the surface of the eye. 3. Auricular Group.â€” Attollens auriculam, Attrahens auriculam, Retrahens auriculam. Dissection.â€”If the pinna of the ear be drawn down by means of a hook, a ridge of skin will rise up, extending from the ear to the cut edge of the scalp ; along this ridge an incision is to be made and the skin reflected downwards ; by this means the upper of the three muscles will be exposed. In like manner the pinna must be drawn liackwards to expose the attrahens, and forwards to expose the retra- liens, the skin being removed Ijy an incision close around the base of the ear, supj)lemented by others running in the course of the muscles. The muscles are best dissected by commencing with their tendons, and thence proceeding in the course of their radiating fibres. The ATTOLLENS AURICULAM, the largest of the three, is a thin fan-shaped plane of muscular fibres, arising from the lateral ])ortion of the epicranial aponeurosis at about the middle of the temporal ridge, and inserted into tlie upper jiart of the concha and inner and upper part of the pinna. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal with the temporal fascia. Nerve-supply.â€”Temporal branches of facial. The ATTRAHENS AURICULAM arises from the lateral portion of the epicranial aponeurosis above the zygoma, and is inserted into the spine of the helix. It is often blended with the anterior edge of the former muscle. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal witli the temporal fascia and temporal artery and veins. Nerve-supply.â€”Temporal Ijranches of facial. The RETRAHENS AURICULAM arises by two (sometimes three) muscular slips from the root of the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of tlie temporal bone. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior auricular branch of facial, and small occipital nerves. Actions.â€”The actions of the auricular muscles are expressed in their nauies ; tliey have but little power in man, but are important muscles in brutes.ORBITAL MUSCLES. 234 4- Ocular Group.â€” Levatpr palpebrse, Rectus intenius, Rectus superior, Rectus externus, Rectus inferior, 01)liquus superior, Obliquus inferior. Dissection.â€”To open the orbit (the calvariuiu and brain liaving been removed) the fi-ontal bone must be sawn tlirougli at tlie inner extremity-of tlie orbital ridge, the saw being directed to the supra- OT'bital notch ; and, externally, at its outer extremity. The roof of the orl)it may then be comminuted with the liammerâ€”a process easily accomplished, on account of the thinness of the orbital plate of tlie frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid. The super- ciliary portion of the orbit may next be driven forwards hy a smart blow, and tlie external angular process and external wall of the orbit outwards in the same manner; the broken fragments of the I'oof of tlie orljit should then be removed. Remove the perios- teum from the whole of the upper surface of the exposed orlnt, and examine the parts beneath. Tlie LEVATOR PALPEBR.aE SUPERIORIS is a long, thin, and triangular muscle situated at the upper part of the orbit in the middle line ; it m-ises from the under surface of the lesser wing of tlie s})henoid, above and in front of the optic foramen, and is inserted into the upper bordei- of the superior tarsal plate by a bi-oad but thin tendon. Relations.â€”By its uj^i^er surface with the fourth nerve, supra- orbital nerve and artery, pei'iosteum of the orbit, and, in front, iniier face of the broad tarsal ligament.

The RECTUS INTERNUS, the thickest and shortest of the straight muscles, arises from the common tendon, and from the fibroxis sheath of tlie optic nerve ; and is inserted into the inner surface of the globe of the eye at two lines from the margin of the cornea. Kelations.â€”By its internal surface with the optic nerve, adipose 'tissue of the orlnt and eyeball. By its outer surface with the perios- teum of the orbit; hj its upper harder with the anterior and pos- terior ethmoidal vessels, nasal and infra-trochlear nerves. Nerve-supply.â€”Inferior division of the third nerve. The RECTUS EXTERNUS, the longest of the straight muscles, arises by two heads, one with the origin of the superior rectus, from the margin of the optic fora- men ; the other partly from tlie common tendon, and partly from the lower margin of the sphenoidal fissure ; the nasal, third, and sixth nerves and oiDhthalmic vein passing between them. It is inserted into the outei' surface of the globe of the eye, a little more tlian two lines from the mar- gin of the cornea. Relations.â€”By its inter- nal surface with the third, nasal, sixth, and optic nerves, ciliary ganglion and nerves, ophthalmic artery and vein, adipose tissue of the orbit, inferior oblique muscle, ancl eyeball. By its external sur- face with the periosteum of the orbit and lachrymal gland ; by the upper border with the lachrymal vessels and nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”The sixth nerve. The recti nuiscles present several characters in common ; thus, they are thin, liave each the form of an isosceles triangle, bear the same relation to the globe of the eye, and are inserted in a similar manner into the sclerotic, at about two lines from the circumference ot the cornea. The points of difterence relate to thickness and length ; the internal rectus is the thickest and shoi'test, the external the longest, and the superior the most tliin. Tlie insertion of the tour recti into the globe of the eye forms a tendinous expansion, whicli IS continued as far as the margin of the cornea, and is tei-med tumca albugmea.

The trochlea ovpulley of the superior oblique muscle is a cartilaginous ring attached to the depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone by bands of white fibrous tissue. The ring is Hat, about a line in width, and provided with a synovial membrane, which is continued, together with a fibrous sheath, for a short dis- tance, upon the tendon. Sometimes the ring is supported, or in part formed, by a process of bone. Relations,â€”By its superior surface with the fourth nerve, supra- trochlear_ nerve, superior rectus, and periosteum of the orbit. By the inferior surface with the adipose tissue of the orbit, globe of the eye, upper border of the internal rectus, and the vessels and nerves crossing that border. Nerve-supply.â€”The fourth nerve. The OBLIQUUS INFERIOR, a thin and narrow muscle, arises from the inner margin of the superior maxillary bone, immediately external to the lachrymal groove, and passes beneath the inferior rectus, to be inserted into the outer and posterior pai't of the eyeball, at about two lines from the entrance of the optic ner^^e. Relations.â€”By its superior surface with the inferior rectus muscle and eyeball; by the inferior surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orliit, and external rectus. Nerve-supply.â€”Inferior division of the third nerve. CAPSULE OF TENON.â€”The muscles of the orbit are separated from the globe of the eyeball and structures immediately surround- ing the optic nerve, by a fascia, which is continuous with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal cartilages. This fascia is termed tunica vaginalis oculi, or capsule of Tenon. It surrounds the eyeball except at the anterior part where it is reflected on the inside of the conjunctiva and eyelids, and is pierced anteriorly, for the passage of the six orbital muscles, by six openings, through which the tendons of the muscles play as through pulleys. Tubular pro- longations are continued on to the muscles as they pierce the capsule, but soon become lost in their sheaths. From this fascia processes pass off into the fat of the orbit, and diAdde the cavity into a number of loculi filled with fat. The most important of these l^ands passes across the lower part of the orbit, and is attached to the malar and lachi'ymal liones ; it slings up the orbital contents, and hence has been called the suspensory ligament by Lockwood. Other bands pass from the malar and lachrymal bones to the sheaths around the external and internal recti muscles ; they serve to check the external and internal rotation of the eyeball, and have been named the external and internal check ligaments. The capsule of Tenon is a serous membrane and is lined vAth endothelium ; it consists of a parietal and visceral layer, and the237 ACTIONS OF THE OEBITAL MUSCLES. space between these forms a lymph-space which is contmiious with the space between the inner and outer sheath of the optic nerve Actionsâ€”The levator palpebrse raises the upper eyelid, ihe four recti, acting singly, pull the eyeball in the four directionsâ€” upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards. Acting by pairs, they carry the eyeball in the diagonal of these directions, viz., upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and in- wards, downwards and outwards. Acting all together, they directly retract the glo^be within the orbit. The superior oblique muscle, acting alone, rolls the globe inwards and forwards, and carries the Fig. 184.â€”Section of right orbit seen from the front, and. showing orbital contents and caiisule of Tenon, i.

The inferior oblique, acting alone, rolls the globe outwards and backwards, and carries the pupil outwards and upwards to the upper and outer angle of the eye. The superior rectus when acting alone tends not only to raise the eyeball, but also to carry it inwards, and rotate it slightly on its own axis ; this tendency to iuA'ersion and rotation is corrected Ijy the combination of that muscle with the inferior oblique, the latter tending to direct the pupil outwards and to rotate the ball in the opposite direction to the rectus.

Nasal Group.â€” Pyramidalis nasi, Compressor nasi, Dilatator naris. Depressor alae nasi. Dissection.â€”The incision ah'eady made down the centre of the nose is to be continued round the margin of the ala to the lower edge of the septum, from thence down the middle of the upper lij) to its free margin ; from this point it should be carried round the mouth to the middle of the lower lip, and from thence verticjiUy downwards to the chin. The whole of the flajj must now be c<xre- fuUy dissected back, care being taken to keep the knife very close to the inner sui'face of the skin. The PYRAMIDALIS NASI is a small pyramidal slip of muscular fibres sent downwards on the bridge of the nose by the occipito- frontalis. It becomes tendinous and is inserted into the tendinous expansion of the compressor nasi. Relations.â€”By its upper surface with the integument; by its under surface with the periosteum of the frontal and nasal bone. Its outer border corresponds with the edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum; its inner border with its fellow, from which it is separated by a narrow areolar interval. Nerve-supply.â€”Infraorbital branch of facialMUSCLES OF NOSE. 239 The COMPRESSOR NASI is a tliin and triangular muscle-; it arises by its apex from the canine ridge of the superior maxillary hone, and spreads out upon the side of the nose into a thin tendinous expansion, which is continuous across the ridge with the muscle of the opposite side, and above with the tendon of the pyramidalis nasi. It is connected at its origin with a muscular fasciculus which is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone im- mediately below the origin of the levator labii superioris aloeque nasi. This muscular slip was termed by Albinus, muscuhis anomalus, from its attachment to bone by both ends. Relations.â€”By its superficial sur- face with the levator labii superioris proprius, levator labii superioris alaeqne nasi, and integument; by its deep surface with the superior maxil- lary and nasal bones, and with the alar and lateral cartilages of the nose. Nerve - supply.â€”Infraorbital branch of facial. The DILATATOR NARIS is a thin .gs-Muscles of the n and indistinct muscular apparatus ex- panded on the ala of the nostril, and consisting of an anterior and poste- rior slip. The anterior slip (levator proprius alse nasi anterior) arises from the upper border and surface of the alar cartilage, and is inserted into the integument of the border of the nostril. The posterior slip (leva- tor proprius alae nasi posterior) arises from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone and sesamoid cartilages, and is inserted into the posterior half of the integument of the border of the nostril. These muscles are difficult of dissection, from the close adhesion of the integument to the nasal cartilages. Nerve-supply.â€”Infraorbital branch of facial. The DEPRESSOR ALiE NASI (depressor labii superioris alseque nasi) is brought into view by drawing upwards the upper lip and laising the mucous membrane.

Actions.â€”The pyramidalis nasi, as a point of attachment of thc occipito-frontalis, assists that muscle in its action : it also draw.< down the inner angle of the eyebrow and pi'oduces short horizontal wrinkles across the root of the nose. By its insertion it fixes the aponeurosis of the compressores nasi, and tends to elevate the nose. The compressores nasi appear to act in expanding rather than im- pressing the nares. The dilatator naris is a dilator of the nostril, and the depressor aloe nasi draws downwards both the ala and columna of the nose, the depression of the latter being a.ssisted by the naso-labialis. 6.

Dissection.â€”The skin has been already removed in order \u display the preceding grouj), but it is necessary now to put a hook in the angle of the mouth and carry it downwards, so as to keep the muscles of the upper lip on the stretch during the removal of the muscular fascia. The ORBICULARIS ORIS is a sphincter muscle, completely sur- rounding the mouth, and possessing consequently neither origin nor insertion. The upper part is attached by means of a small muscular fasciculus (riaso-labialis) to the columna of the nose. It is divisible into two portions, internal or marginal, in immediate contact with the lips, and thick ; and external, broad and thin; the separation between the two being indicated by the coronary arteries. The internal fibres are continued uninterruptedly from one lip to the other round the angle of the mouth, the external fibres decussate with those of the buccinator, the upper fibres of the orbicularis being continued into the lower ones of the lattei' muscle, and vice versa. Accessory filji'es spring from the incisive fossa of the ujiper and lower jaw, and pass tn the deej) aspect of the muscle. In addition to the buccinator its fibres intermingle with those of the levator lal)ii superioris proprius, levator labii superioris alseque na^i, depressor labii superioris alseque nasi, levator anguli oris, zygomaticu.'^ major, risorius Santorini, depressor anguli oris, depressor labii in- ferioris, and levator labii inferioris.

The ZYGOMATIC muscles are two slender fasciculi of fibres which arise from the malar bone, and are inserted into the upper lip. Tlie zygomaticus major descends to the angle of the mouth, and is continuous with the inferior segment of the orbicularis, depressor anguli oris, and risorius Santorini. The zygomaticus minor, lying in front of the major, becomes connected witli the outer border of the levator labii superioris proprius, and is attached to the integument of the upper lip. This muscle is in reality only a detached slip of the orbicularis palpebrarum.

Actions.â€”The orbicularis oris produces the direct closure of the lips by means of its continuity, at the angles of the mouth, with the fibres of the buccinator. When acting singly in the forcible closure of the mouth, the integument is thrown into wrinkles, in consequence of its firm connection with the surface of the muscle ; its naso-labial 9MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 242 fasciculus draws downwards tlie columna nasi. Tlie levator labii superioris alaj([ue nasi lifts the upper lip with the ala of the nose, and expands the opening of the nares. The levator labii superioris propi'ius is the proper elevator of the ujjper lip : acting singly, it draws tlie lip a little to one side. The levatoi' proprius, ana still more the levator alse nasi, is brought into play in the expression of contempt or derision. The levator anguli oris lifts the angle of tlie mouth and draws it inwards, while the zygomatici pull it upwards and outwards, as in laughing, and produce the dimple in the cheek. In the movement of laughter the zygomatici are assisted by the risorius Santorini. 7. Inferior Labial G-roup.â€” Depressor labii inferior is, Risorius Santorini, Depressor anguli oris. Levator labii inferioris. Dissection.â€”To dissect the inferior labial region, continue the incision already made along the margin of the lower jaw to its angle. Dissect off the integument and superficial fascia from this surface, and the muscles of the inferior labial region will be exposed. The DEPRESSOR LABII INFERIORIS (quadratas menti) arise.-- from the oblique line by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and passing upwards and im^^ards, is inserted into the orbicularis muscle and integiiment of the lower lip. Its inner fibres interlact' with those of the opposite muscle; the outer fibres reach nearly hi the angle of the mouth. This muscle is very thin, and pale in colour, and its fibres ^re mixed with a considerable quantity of fat, so that it is very difficult to make a good dissection of it. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the platysma myoides, part of the depressor anguli oris, and the integument of the chin with which it is closely connected.

It is in relation with the mucous membrane of the moiith, with its fellow, and with the dejDressor labii inferioris. Nerve-supply.â€”Supra-maxillary of facial. The whole of the muscles of the face have attachments to the integu- ments, as well as to each other and to the bones, and it is chiefly in consequence of the integumentary attachments that they act as muscles -of expression, for it is by this means that the ridges and furrows which give such characteristic expressions to the face are produced. Actions.â€”The depressor labii inferioris draws the lower lip down- wards, and a little outwards. The depressor anguli oris, from the radiated direction of its fibres, will pull the angle of the mouth either downwards and forwards, or downwards and backwards, and be expressive of grief; or acting with the levator Miguli oris, zygo- maticns major, and risorius Santorini, will draw the angle of the mouth upwards and backwards, or directly backwards. The levator labii inferioris raises and jDrotrudes the integument of the cliin. 8. Maxillary Group.â€” Masseter, Buccinator, Temporal, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. Dissection.â€”The flap already, obtained must be carried as far back as the posterior margin of the ramus of the jaw, and the struc- tures which cover the masseter must be cut awayl Fascia.â€”The masseter muscle is covered by a strong layer of fascia continued on to it from the surface of the parotid' gland (parotideo-masseteric fascia) ; below, it may be traced into â–  the neck, where it is found to be continuous ^vith the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. It is intimately connected with the tendinous fibres of the muscle, and is attached above to the lower border of the zygomatic arch. The MASSETER (/xoo-o-ao/xat, to chew) is a short, thick, and some- what quadrilateral muscle, composed of two planes of filjres, super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer arises by a strong aponeurosis from the malar process of the superior maxillarv bone and lowei- border of the malar bone, and passes doAvuAvards "and backwards to be inserted into the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla The deep layer arises from the lower border of the malar bone and zygo- matic process of the temporal, and passes downwards and forwaixls to lie inserted into the upper half of the ramus.

By its internal surface with the temporal muscle, buccinator, from which it is separated by a mass of fat, and I'amus of the lower jaw. By its posterior border witli the parotid gland ; by tlie anterior border with the facial artery and vein. Nerve-supply.â€”Masseteric branch of the inferior maxillary of the fifth cereljral nerve. Fascia.â€”The strong aponeurotic layer wliich covers the temporal muscle is called the temporal fascia or aponeurosis ; it is attached above to the posterioi- boi'dei' of tlie malar bone aiul the upper temporal crest on the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones. Below it separates into two layers, between which there is a small (piantity of fat, a small nerve derived from the orl)ital branch of the sujjerior maxil- lary nerve, and the orbital Ijranch of the temporal artery. Of these two layers one is attached to tlie outer, and the other to the inner surface of the zygoma. Dissection.â€”Make an incision along the upjier border of the zygoma, foi' the purpose of separating the temporal fascia from its attachment. Then saw through the zygomatic process of the malar l)one, and through the root of the zygoma near the meatus auditorius. Draw down the zygoma, and with it the origin of the masseter, and dissect the latter muscle away from the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. Now remove the temporal fascia from the resi of its attachment, and the whole of the temporal muscle will bo brought into view. The TEMPORAL is a broad and radiating muscle, occiijiying a considerable extent of the side of the head, and filling the temporal fossa. It arises by tendinous filjres froui the wliole length of the inferior temporal crest, and by muscular fibres from the temporal fascia and entire surface of the temporal fossa, excejDting the anterior or malar wall. Its fibres converge to a strong and narrow tendon, which is inserted into the apex, internal surface, and anterior border of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, as far down as the junction of the body and ramus. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the temporal fascia (which separates it from the attoUens and attraliens auriculam muscles, and temporal vessels and nerves) and with the zygoma and masseter. By its internal sitrface with the bones forming the temporal fossa, the external pterygoid muscle, part of the Iniccinator, and the internal maxillary artery with its deep temporal branches. Nerve-supply.â€”Temporal branches of the inferior maxillary of the fifth cerebral nerve. Dissection,â€”Saw through the ramus of the lower jaw a little above the level of the crowns of the lower molar teeth, then divide the neck of the condyle with saw and bone-forceps. Now turn up the coronoid process and portion of ramus thus detached, together with the teuiporal muscle (which may be dissected from the fossa), and a view of the entire extent of the buccinator and extei'nal pleiy- "oid muscles will be oljtained. IMUSCLES OF MASTICATION. 245 The BUCCINATOR (buccina, a trumpet), tlie trumpeter's muscle, ai-ises from tlie base of the alveolar processes of the superior and in- ferior maxillary bones, corresponding to the three molar teeth, and the pterygo-maxiUary ligament. This ligament is the raphe of union between the buccinator and superior constrictor muscles, and is attached by one extremity to the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate, and by tlie other to the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower jaw. The fibres of the muscle converge towards the angle of the mouth, where some are continuous with the levator and depressor anguli oris, and the greater number cross each other, the superior being continuous with the inferior segment of the orbicularis oris, the inferior with the superior segment. The fibres along the upper border of the muscle pass directly into the upper fibres of the orbicularis and do not decussate, and those along the lower border in like manner pass directly into the lower fibres of that muscle. The muscle is in^'ested externally by a thin fascia (buccal) which extends backwards to the pharynx. Relations.â€”By its external surface, posteriorly, Avith a large and rounded mass of fat, which separates the muscle from the ramus of the lower jaw, temporal, and masseter : anteriorly with the risorius Santorini, zygomatici, levator anguli oris, and depressor anguli oris. It is also in relation with a part of Stenson's duct (which pierces it opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw), with the trans- \'erse facial artery, branches of the facial and buccal nerves, and facial and buccal arteries and veins. By its internal surface with the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth. Nerve-supply.â€”Buccal branch of facial, which supplies it on its superficial surface. The PTERYGOIDEUS EXTERNUS is a short and thick muscle, broader at its origin than at its insertion. It arises by two heads, one from the pterygoid ridge on the under surface of the great wing of the sphenoid ; the other from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, tuberosity of the palate bone and tuberosity of the superior maxillai'y. The fibres pass backwards to be inserted into a depression on the anterior aspect of the neck of the lower jaw, and into the interarticular fibro-cartilage. The internal maxillary artery passes between the two heads of this muscle, and the lower head is commonly pierced by the Iniccal branch of the fifth nerve. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the ramus of the lower jaw, temporal muscle, and internal maxillary artery ; by its internal surface witli the intei'ual pterygoid muscle, internal lateral liga- ment of the jaw, middle lueningeal artery, and inferior maxillary nerve ; by its wpper harder with the muscular branches of the inferior maxillary nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”Buccal branch of inferior maxillary. Dissection.â€”The condyle of the jaw must now be removed from its socket, and, together with the external pterygoid, be turned over towards the nose, so as to expose the internal pterygoid.

It de- scends obliipiely backwards, to be imerted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw. It resembles the masseter in a])pear- ance and direction, and was named by Winslow internal masseter. Relations. â€” By its external surface with the external ]jtery- goid, inferior maxillary nerve and branches, internal maxillary artery and branches, internal lateral ligament, and ramus of the lower jaw. By its internal surface with the tensor palati, superior constrictor and fascia of the pharynx ; by its posterior border with the parotid gland. Nerve-supply.â€”Pterygoid branch of inferior maxillary. Actions.â€”The maxillary muscles are the active agents in masti- cation, and iovm an apparatus admirably fitted for that office. The buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of tlie tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connection with the superior constrictoi-, it shortens the cavity of the pharynx from before backwards, and becomes an auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal ptei'^^goid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterygoid in gi-ind- ing the food, by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the ujjper; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temj^oral. The external pterygoid muscles, when both act together, draw the jaw forwards, but more frequently they act alternately, each drawing the jaw forwards and towards the opposite side, so as to produce by their alternate action the grinding movements of the molar teeth. The internal pterygoid assists the external muscle of the same side in protracting the jaw, and throw- ing the teeth towards the opposite side. The temporal is the only muscle of mastication which retracts the jaw ; all the rest protract it. The whole of these muscles, acting in succession, produce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the upper, effects the mastication of the food.MUSCLES AND FASCIiE OF THE NECK. 247 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups, cor- responding with the natural divisions of the region ; they are :â€” 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Palatine group. 7. Prtevertebral group. 8. Laryngeal group. Superficial Group.â€” Platysma myoides. Sterno-cleido mastoid. Dissection.â€”The dissection of the neck should be commenced by making an incision along the middle line of its fore-part from the chin to the sternum, and bounding it superiorly and infei'iorly by two transverse incisions; the superior being carried along the margin of the lower jaw, and across the mastoid process to the pro- tuberance on the occipital bone, the inferior along the clavicle to the acromion process. The square tiap of integument thus included should be turned back from the entire side of the neck, which brings into view the superficial fascia, and on the removal of a thin layer of this the platysma myoides will be exposed. The superficial cervical fascia is a part of the common super- ficial fascia of the entire body, and is only interesting from contain- ing between its layers the jjlatysma myoides muscle. The PLATYSMA MYOIDES {TrXarvs fiis etSoy, broad muscle-like lamella) is a thin plane of musciilar fibres, situated beneath tlie integument on the side of the neck. It arises from the fascia over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, and from the clavicle and acromion ; it passes obliquely upwards and inwards to be inserted into the side of the chin, oblique line of the lower jaw, angle of the mouth, and integument of the face. The anterior fibres mingle beneath the chin with those of the muscle of the opposite side ; the next interlace with the depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris ; the posterior fibres are disposed in a transverse direction across the lower part of the face, arising from the fascia over the parotid gland and masseter muscle, and inserted into the angle of the mouth, where they form part of the risorius Santorini muscle. The entire muscle is analogous to the cutaneous muscle of brutes, the'pannimlus carnosus.

Nerve-supply.â€”Its upper part by the facial, its lower by the supei'ficial cervical. Dissection.â€”The platysma is now to be removed, commencing in front and turning it backwards towards the spine ; great care must be taken not to cut the branches of the superficial cervical plexus, or the external jugular vein which lies beneath it. The deep cervical fascia will now be exposed, and must be carefully studied. The deep cervical fascia is a strong areolo-fibrous membrane which invests the muscles of the neck, and retains and supports tlie vessels and nerves. It commences posteriorly at the ligamentum nuchoe, and passes forwards at each side beneath the trapezius Fif;. 187.â€”Transverse section of the neck, showing the deep cervical fascia and its prolongations forming sheaths for the muscles, i.

Besides constituting a sheath for the stei'no-mastoid, it also forms sheaths for the other muscles of the neck over which it ]-Â»asses. If the superficial layer (anterior layer) of the sheath of the sterno- mastoid be traced'upwards, it will be found to pass over the parotid (Tland and masseter muscle (fascia parotideo-masseterica), to be in- serted into the zygomatic arch ; traced downwards, it will be seen to pass to the front of the clavicle, to which it becomes attached. If the deep layer (posterior layer) of the sheath be examined supe-249 STERNO-CLEIDO MASTOID. riorly, it will be found attached to the styloid process, from which it is reflected to the angle of the lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxil- lary ligament; followed downwards, a process of it will be found connected with the tendon of the omo-hyoid muscle, binding it down to the clavicle, while still low^er it becomes continuous with the costo-coracoid membrane. It is pierced in the posterior triangle of the neck by the external jugular vein. In the middle line the deep cervical fascia is thin above where it becomes attached to the hyoid bone, but as it descends it becomes thicker and splits into two layers, a superficial and a deep, between which there is a little fat and areolar tissue, as well as a lymphatic gland. The superficial of these layers is attached to the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and below to the sternum and inter-clavicular ligament; the deep layer is intimately connected with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid, ensheathing them, and becoming attached to the posterior surface of the sternum. Still deeper in the anterior triangle, a thin sheet of fascia passes behind the depressor muscles of tlie hyoid to invest the thyroid body, and being continued on to the trachea may be traced to the fibrous layer of the pericardium, with which it blends. The deep cervical fascia also forms a sheath for the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve, a fibrous sej^tum intervening between the artery and vein. That portion of the fascia which covers the muscles lying on the front of the vertebral column, and intervenes between them and the pharynx and oesophagus, is called the jore-vertebral fascia. Dissection,â€”Remove the deep cervical fascia and exjjose the sterno-mastoid muscle. The STERNO-CLEIDO MASTOID is the large oblicpie muscle of the neck, and is situated between tAvo layers of the deep cervical fascia. It arises, as implied by its name, from the sternum and clavicle (/cXeiSioj/), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards, to be inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal, and superior curved line of the occipital bone. The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a considerable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, separate from the sternal portion below, but blended with the posterior surface of the latter as it ascends. The two portions of this muscle are sometimes described as separate muscles under the names of sterno-mastoid and cleido-mastoid, these being again occasionally subdivided, the first into sterno-mastoid and strnio-occifiial, and the second into cleido-mastoid and deido-ocdintal. The cleido-mastoid is the most deeply seated slip of the muscle, and has a separate attachment to the mastoid process; it is generallv perforated hy the spinal accessory nerve.

If the head be fixed, they can raise the sternum in forced insj^iration. Regional Anatomy of the Neck, The region of the neck is divided into two great tiiangles by the sterno-mastoid muscle. The posterior triangle is bovmded by the posterior border of the muscle, by the claAdcle, and by the anterior edge of the trapezius. The anterior triangle is bounded by the anterior Ijorder of the sterno-mastoid, by the lower border of the inferior inaxilla, and a line drawn from the angle of this bone to the mastoid process, and by the mesial line. The posterior triangle is subdivided into two by the scapular belly of the omo-hyoid muscle. The posterior superior triangle (occi- pital triangle) is bounded by the posterior border of the sterno-mas- toid, the anterior edge of the trapezius, and the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Its floor is formed from above downwards by the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulce, scalenus posticus, scalemis medius, and upper digitation of the serratus magnus muscles. It contains the superficial descending branches of the cervical plexus, the spinal accessory ner\^e, the transversalis colli artery and vein, the super- ficialis colli artery, and the cervical lymphatics and glands. The posterior inferior or subclavian triangle is bounded by the clavicle, the posterior Ijelly of the omo-hyoid, and the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. This triangle contains the third part of the subclavian artery, above and behind which are the trunks of the brachial plexus ; below, and in front of it, almost overlapped by the clavicle, the subclavian vein, in close proximity to which, behind the clavicle, is the suprascapular artery, both of which vessels, although not strictly in the triangle, are apt to invade it as soon as the fascia is divided in the operation for ligature of the subclavian. The external jugular vein terminates in the sub- clavian \ein aljout the middle of this space; near its termination it receives the transversalis colli and suprascapular veins. This triangle also contains a small nerve to the subclavius, muscle and a lymphatic gland. The anterior triangle has been divided into threeâ€”the inferior carotid, the superior carotid, and the submaxillary. The inferior carotid triangle is bounded by the mesial line, the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Its floor is formed by the longus colli muscle and vertebral column, and its roof by the integument, superficial fascia, platysma myoides, and deep cervical fascia. It contains the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, common carotid artery, internal .jugular vein, inferior thyroid arterv, superior thyroid artery, thyroid body, lower part of larynx, trachea, lower part of pharvnx,' a'so- phagus, recurrent laryngeal nerve, descendens and conimunicans ceryicis nerves, sympatlietic nerves, inferior thyroid veins, and one or two lymphatic glands.252 DEPRESSORS OF THE HYOID BONE AND LARYNX. The superior carotid triangle (the place of selection ior ligature of the carotid artery) is liounded l^y the anterior liorder of the aterno-niastoid, the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and the pos- terior belly of the digastricus. Its iioor is formed by jjaits of the thyro-hyoid, hyo-glossus, and middle and inferior constrictor muscles, and its roof by the integument, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia. It contains the common, external and internal carotid arteries, tlie superior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital, and ascending pharyngeal arteries ; the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, ascending j)haryngeal and internal jugular veins; the hypoglossal, vagus, spinal accessory, descendens cervicis, superior laryngeal and sympathetic nerves ; the upper part of larj'nx and lower part of pharynx ; some lymphatic vessels and glands. The submaxillary triangle is bounded above by the lower border of the body of the lower jaw, the parotid gland and mastoid process, below by the posterior belly of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoid, in front by the mesial line. Its floor is formed by the anterior belly of the digastricus, the mylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles. The space contains the submaxillary gland, facial artery and vein, sub- mental artery, mylo-hyoid artery and nerve, external carotid artery, part of the parotid gland, intei-nal carotid artery, commencement of external and interior jugular veins, pneumogastric and glosso- pharyngeal nerves, and submaxillary lymi^hatic vessels and glands.

Dissection.â€”These muscles are brought into view hy removing tlie deep fascia from the front of the neck between the two sterno- mastoid muscles. The omo-hyoid to be seen in its whole extent requires that the sterno-mastoid muscle be divided from its origin and turned aside. . . The STERNO-HYOID is a narrow ribbon-like muscle, arimui Ironi the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum and from the inner extremity of the clavicle.

The OMO-HYOID (aj/ioy, shoulder) is a double-bellied muscle passing obliquely across the neck from the scapula to the os hyoides ; it forms an obtuse angle behind the sterno-mastoid, and is retained in that position by a process of the deep cervical fascia which forms a sheath for its tendon and holds it in connection with tlie sternum and first rib. It arises from the iipper liorder of the scaj)ula and transverse ligament of the suprascapular notch, and is inserted into the hyoid bone at the junction of the body and great cornu.

Nerve-supply. â€”Descendens cervicis. Actions.â€”The four muscles of this group are depressors of the hyoid bone and larynx, the three former drawing these parts downwards in the middle line, and the two omo-hyoid muscles regulating their traction to the one or other side of the neck, accord- ing to tlie position of the head. The omo-hyoid muscles, by means of tlieir connection with the deep cervical fascia, are rendered tensors of that portion of the deep fascia which covers the lower part of the neck, between the two sterno-mastoid muscles. The thyro- hyoid muscles, Ijy approximating the hyoid bone to the thyroid cartilage, relax the hyo-epiglottic ligament, and ]lermit the epiglottis to fall down over the aperture of the larynx during deglutition (G.

The DIGASTRICUS {d\s, twice ; yaar^p, belly ; biventer) is a small muscle situated immediately beneatli the side of the body of the lower jaw ; fleshy at each extremity, and tendinous in the" middle. It arises from the digastric fossa and anterior border of the mastoid process of the temporal bone ; pierces by its posterior' belly the stylo-hyoid muscle, and is inserted into a depression on the inner side of the lower jeL^v, close to the symphysis. The middle tendon is held in connection with the Ijody of the os hyoides by an aponeu- rotic loop, through which it plays as through a pulley ; the loop being lubricated by a synoA'ial membrane. A thin layer of aponeu- rosis is given off from the tendon of the digastricus at each side, which is connected with the body of the os hyoides, and forms a strong jjlane of fascia between the anterior portions of the two muscles. This fascia, the siq^ra-hyoidean, is continuous with the^ deep cervical fascia. wM Relations.â€”By its suijerficial surface with the platysma myoides,^ sterno-mastoid, trachelo-mastoid, anterior fasciculus of the stylo- hyoid muscle, parotid gland, and submaxillary gland. By its detp surface with the styloid muscles, hyo-glossus, mylo-hyoid, external carotid artery, lingual and facial arteries, internal carotid artei y, jugular vein, and hypoglossal nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”The anterior belly of the digastric muscle is supplied by the mylo-hyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior maxil- lary ; the posterior belly by a branch of the facial. The STYLO-HYOID is a small and slender muscle situated in immediate relation with the posterior lielly of the digastricus, by which it is pierced. It arises from the middle of the styloid process, its outer side, and is inserted in the body of the os hyoides near the union of the lesser cornu with the body. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the posterior belly of the digastricus, parotid gland and submaxillary gland ; its deep rela- tions are similar to those of the posterior belly of the digastricus.

Dissection.â€”The digastricus and stylo-hyoid must be removed from their connection with the lower jaA\- and os hyoides, and turned aside, in order to see the next muscle. The MYLO-HYOID (fivXr], mola, i.e., attached to the molar ridge of the lower jaw) is a loroad and ti-iangular plane of muscular fibres, forming, with its fellow of the opposite side, the floor of the mouth.ELEVATOR MUSCLES OF THE HYOID BONE. 255 It arises from the whole length of the xnolar ridge of ^he]^^^^^ from the synr.hysis^^^^ '"iVThtHf the Zo^%t^le To^^^^^^^ l^eing inserted Into the l ody ^f tKs Isolde's.

Nerve-supply.â€”The mylo-hyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior dental, wliich supplies it on its lower or superficial surface. Dissection.â€”After the mylo-hyoid has been examined, it should be cut away I'rom its origin and insertion, and completely removed. 1 The view of the next muscles would also be improved by dividing the lower jaw a little to the side of the symphysis, and drawing it outwards ; or removing it altogether if the ramus have been already cut across in dissecting the internal pterygoid muscle. The tongue may then be drawn out of the mouth by means of a hook. The GENIO-HYOID {yeufwv, the chin) arises from a small tubercle on the inner skle of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. It is a short and slender muscle,256 muscles' of the tongue. closely connected with its fellow and with the Ijorder of the following. Relations.â€”By its superficial or inferior surface with the mylo- hyoid ; by the deeio or superior surface with the lower border of tlie genio-hyo-glossus. Nerve-supply.â€”The hypoglossal nerve. The GENIO-HYO-GLOSSUS {yXSxraa, the tongue) is a triangular muscle, narrow and pointed at its origin from the lower jaw, Ijroad and fan-shaped at its attachment to the tongue. It arises from a tubercle aljove that of the genio-hyoid, and spreads out to be inserted into the Avliole length of the tongue, from base to apex, and into the body of the os hyoides. Relations.^â€”By its inner surface with its fellow of the oppo.sile side. By its outer surface with the mylo-hyoid, hyo-glossus, stylo- glossus, lingualis, sublingual gland, lingual artery, gustatory ner\ e, and hypoglossal nerve. By its upper border with mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, in the situation of the frsenum lingua'; V)y its loiver border with the genio-hyoid. Nerve-supply.â€”The hypoglossal nerve. Actions.â€”All the memljers of this group of muscles act on the OS hyoides when the lower jaw is fixed, and on the lower jaw when the OS hyoides is drawn downwards and fixed by its depressor muscles. They act, therefore, as depressors of the jaw or as elevatoi s of the hyoid bone. The genio-hyo-glossus is, moreover, a muscle of the tongue ; its action upon tliat organ will be considered witli the next group. Fourth Group.â€”Muscles of the Tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Lingualis, Hyo-glossus, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. Dissection.â€”These are already exposed by the preparation we have just made ; there remains, therefore, only to dissect and examine thena. The substance of the tongue is chiefly composed of muscular fibres; these are divisible into two sets, the extrinsic and in- trinsic. The extrinsic muscles are the genio-hyo-glossus, hyo- glossus, stylo-glossus and palato-glossus. The intrinsic muscles of the tongue form the great bulk of that organ, and are known collectively under the general title of lingualis. The genio-hyo-glossus, the first of these muscles, has been de- scribed with the last group. , ^ The HYO-GLOSSUS is a square-shaped plane of muscle, arising from the whole length of the great cornu, the lesser cornu, and side of the body of the os hyoides ; and inserted between the stylo-glos.sus and lingualis into the side of the tongue. The direction of the fibres which arise from the body is obliquely backwards ; those from the <'-reat cornu pass obliquely forwards ; hence they are described byMUSCLES OF THE TONGUE 257 Albinus as two muscles, under the names of basio-glossus and cerato-glossus, to which he added a tliird fasciculus, arising from the lesser cornu, and spreading along the side of the tongue, the chondro-glossus. The basio-glossus slightly overlaps the upper part of the cerato-glossus, and is separated from it by the transverse portion of the stvlo-glossus. i -. -j Relationsâ€”By its external surface with the digastric, stylo-hyoid, stylo-glossus, inylo-hyoid, gustatory nerve, hypoglossal nerve, Whar- ton's duct, and sublingual gland. By its internal surface with the middle constrictor of the pharynx, liiigualis, genio-hyo-glossus, lingual artery, and glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”The hypoglossal nerve. THE LINGUALIS.â€”Muscular fibres may be seen towards the apex of the tongue, issuing from the interval be- tween the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus ; these constitute the lin- ;ualis longitudinalis inferior. It consists of a small fasciculus of fibres 'unning longitudinally rom the base, where it is attached to the oshyoides, to the apex of the tongue. The other muscles en- tering into the structure of the tongue, are the lingualis longitudinalis Fig. 190.â€”Extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the mmprinr vpI t^miorfiri- tongue, '.i.

Genio- versus, and the lingualis hyo-giossus. 6, 6. Hyo-giossus. 7. stylo-glossus. verticalis. The lingua- lis superior forms a thin plane on the upper surface of the organ, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane, and is intermixed â– with fine areolar and adipose tissue. This layer is thicker in front than behind, and is covered posteriorly by a thin stratum of transverse fibres derived from tlie hyo-glossus. The lingualis transversus con- stitutes the chief bulk of the tongue; it lies between the lingualis superior and inferior, its fibres being attached at the middle line to the fibrous septum of the tongue, and laterally to the mucous mem- brane ; some of its fibres are continuous Avith those of the stylo- glossus, hyo-glossus, and jDalato-glossus. The lingualis verticalis forms a series of curves in each half of the tongue, intersecting the ti'ansverse lingualis, and extending from the dorsum to the under surface, where many of the fibr.es become continuous with these of the genio-hyo-glossus. The fibres of the muscular struc- ture of the tongue are separated from each other by a large quantity of very fine fat and some ghmdular tissue. The lateral halves of258 MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. the tongue are divided by a fibrous septum, which involves only the inner or medullary jiortion of the muscular mass, but is suffi- ciently complete to prevent anastomosis of the arteries of one side with those of the other. Nerve-supply.â€”The several layers of muscular fibre which con- stitute the lingualis muscle are chiefly supplied by the hypoglossal nerve, l)ut some filaments of the facial also reach them. The STYLO GLOSSUS arises from the apex of the styloid process and from tlie stylo-maxillary ligament; it divides on the side of the tongue into two parts, one transverse, which passes inwards between the two portions of the hyo-glossus, and is lost among the trans^'erse fibres of the substance of the tongue ; the other longitudinal, which spreads out upon the side of the tongue, and is jirolonged forwards with the inferior lingualis as far as its tip. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, gustatory nerve, parotid gland, sublingual gland, and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. By its internal surface with the tonsil, superior constrictor of the pharynx, and hyo-glossus. Nerve-supply.â€”The hypoglossal and facial nerves. The PALATO-GLOSSUS passes between the soft palate and the side of the base of the tongue, forming a prominence of the mucous membrane, which is called the anterior pillar of the fauces. Its tilires are spread out superiorly among the muscular fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, and inferiorly among the fibres of the stylo- glossus npon the side of the tongue. Nerve - supply.â€”This muscle is supplied by branches from Meckel's ganglion and the pharyngeal plexus ; the motor filaments being ultimately traceable to the facial. Actions.â€”The genio-hyo-glossus muscle eftects several move- ments of the tongue. When the tongue is steadied and pointed by the other muscles, the posterior fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus would dart it from the mouth, while its anterior fibres would restore it to its former j)osition. The whole length of the muscle acting on the tongue, would render it concave along the middle line, and form a channel for the current of fluid towards the pharynx, as in sucking. The apex of the tongue is directed to the roof of the mouth, and rendered couA^ex from before back- wards by the linguales. The hyo-glossi, by dra\ving do-Â«Ti the sides of the tongue, render it convex along the middle line. It is drawn upwards at its base by the palato-glossi, and backwards or to either side by the stylo-glossi. The ijalato-glossi muscles, assisted by the uvula, have the power of closing the fauces com- pletely, an action which takes place in deglutition. The lingualis fibres "are mainly brought into play in the production of articulate speech.259 MFSGLES OF THE PHARYNX. Fifth Group.â€”Muscles of the Pharynx. Inferior constrictor, Middle constrictor, Snjierior constrictor. Stylo-pliaryngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. IB Dissection.â€”To dissect the pharynx, the trachea and oesophagus are to be cut through at the lower part of the neck, and drawn upwards by dividing the loose areolar tissue which connects the back of the pharynx with the vertebral column. The saw is then to be applied behind the styloid processes, and the base of the skull sawni through.

Fascia.â€”Tlie pharyngeal fascia or aponeurosis is a strong sheet situated ijetween the muscles and mucous membrane ; it is especialh- strong at its upper part, where it fills in the interval left above the lestooned upper margin of the superior constrictor, and is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone and petrous portion of the lemporal. It is strengthened in the middle line by a strong band vliicii IS attached to the pharyngeal tubercle on the basilar i)rocess ot the occipital bone ; this lias been named by Cleland the cranio- 20.

As it passes clown, the fascia giadual]\ becomes thinner, and at the lower part of the pharynx is distin- guishable only as a layer of connective tissue uniting the mucous and muscular coats. The constrictors of the pharynx are web-like sheets of nuiscl(; with fibres differently dis])osed, which form a muscular bag attached to the base of the skull. This bag communicates in front with the mouth. Each of the constrictors may be described as ha\dng one posterior attachment and several lateral. The INFERIOR CONSTRICTOR, the thickest of the three con- strictor muscles, arises from the cricoid cartilage, and the inferior cornn and ol)lif[ue line of the thyroid.

By its internal surface with the middle constrictoi-, stylo-])haryngeus, palato-pliaryii- o-ens, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. By its lower bordeA near the cricoid cartilage, it is in relation with the recurrent laryngeal nerve ; and by the uppar border with the superior laryn- geal nerve. The muscle must be remf)ved before the next can be fully seen. The MIDDLE CONSTRICTOR arises from the gi'eat cornu of the OS hyoides, from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid lig'i-SUPERIOE CONSTEICTOE MUSCLE. ! ment. It radiates from its origin, and spreads out upon the side of I the pharynx, the lower fibres descending and being overlapped by â–  the inferior constrictor ; the upper fibres ascending, so as to cover in I the superior constrictor. It is inserted into the raphe of_ the pharynx, i and by a fibrous aponeurosis into tlie basilar process of the occipital : bone. ] Relations.â€”By its external surface with the vertebral coluuin, ! longus coUi, rectus anticus major, carotid vessels, inferior constrictor, 1 hyo-glossus, lingual artery, pharyngeal plexus of nerves, and some I lymphatic glands. By its internal surface witli the superior con- i strictor, stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. ' The upper portion of this muscle must be turned down, to bring !tlie whole of the superior constrictor into view ; in so doing, the I stylo-jiharyngeus muscle will be seen passing behind its upper I border. The SUPERIOR CONSTRICTOR is a thin and quadrilateral plane of muscular fibres arising from the side of the tongue, the mucous ; membrane of the fioor of the mouth, the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower jaw, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and lower third of the i^osterior margin of the internal pterygoid plate ; and inserted, into the raphe of the pharynx and basilar process of tlie occipital bone. Its superior fibres are arched, leaving a concave interspace between its ujij^er border and the basilar jjrocess; some of its lower fibres are continuous with those of the genio-hyo-glossus on the side of the tongue, and it is overlapped inferiorly by the middle constrictor. I Relations.â€”By its external surface with the vertebral column and ! muscles of the latter, behind ; Avith the vessels and nerves contained in the maxillo-phcmjngeal space laterally, and with the middle con- strictor, stylo-pharyngeus, and tensor palati. By its internal surface hvith the levator palati, palato-pharyngeus, tonsil, and mucous niem- ibrane of the pharynx. I Nerve-supply.â€”The consti-ictor muscles of the pharynx are supplied by a plexus of nerves derived from the superior laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the pneumogastric, the glosso-pharyn- geal, and cervical plexus, mixed with some hl)res from the sym- pathetic. Muscular Interspaces.â€”The three constrictor muscles of tlie pharynx, having festooned upper edges, necessarily leave between tliem muscular interspaces ; these being occupied by important structures, require to be recognised and remembered. The first is l)laced between the unper edge of the superior constrictor and the i base of the skull, and has received the name of Sinus of Mor- : gagni ; it gives passage to the Eustachian tube, levator palati muscle, and a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery, and is i closed in by the pharyngeal aponeurosis and mucous menibrane. I The second space is between the superior and middle constrictors ; it contains the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve. I262 MUSCLES OF THE PHAEYNX. The third sjjace forms the interval between tlie middle and iuferioi' constrictors ; it corresponds to the lateral part of the thyroid-hyoid membrane, and transmits the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. Maxillo-Pharyngeal Space.â€”Between the side of the pharynx and ramus of the lower jaw is a triangular interval, the maxillo- pharyngeal space, which is bounded at the injier side hy the supe- rior constrictor muscle ; at the outer side by the internal pterygoid muscle ; and hehind by the rectus anticus major and vertelwal column. In this space are situated the internal carotid artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal jugular vein, glosso-pharyn- geal, iDneumogastric, spinal accessory, sympathetic, and hypoglossal nerves. The STYLO-PHARYNGEUS is a long and slender muscle arising from the inner side of the l^ase of the styloid process; it descends between the superior and middle constrictor muscles, and spreads out beneath the mucous membrane of the pharynx ; it is inserted partly into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and partly into the internal face of the inferior constrictor. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the stylo-glossus muscle, external carotid artery, parotid gland, and middle constrictor. By its internal surface with the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, superior constrictor, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous membrane. Along its lower border is seen the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which crosses it opposite the root of the tongue, to pass between the superior and middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus. Nerve-supply.â€”Glosso-j)haryngeal nerve. Associated in function with the preceding is a small muscle, not always present, the salpingo-pharyngeus (aaXTny^, a tube), which arises from the lower border of the Eustachian tube near its apertm-e, and passes down upon the inner surface of the side of the phar}Tix, where it becomes united with the palato-pharyngeus. The palato-pharyngeus is described mth the muscles of the soft palate. Actions.â€”The three constrictor muscles are important agents in deglutition ; they contract upon the morsel of food as soon as it is received by the pharynx, and convey it downwards into the oeso- phagus. Constriction of the pharynx takes place by the anterior wall of the cavity being di'awn backwards, and at the same time there is a slight upward movement of the hyoid bone and larynx in con- sequence of the oblique direction of most of the fibres of the middle and inferior constrictors. The stylo-pharyngei draw the pharynx upwards, and widen it laterally. The palato-pharyngei also draw it upwards, and with the aid of the uvula close the opening of the fauces. The salpingo-pharyngei are elevators of the upper part of the pharynx. A more complete description of the mechanism of deglutition will be given alter the palate muscles have been described.263 MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE. Sixth Group.â€”Muscles of the Soft Palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos nvnla^, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. Dissection.â€”To examine these muscles, the pharynx must be opened from behind by a vertical incision, and the niucous mem- brane carefully re- moved from the pos- terior siu^face of the soft palate. The LEVATOR PALATI, a moderately thick muscle, ariseti 3-^ from the extremity of the petrous iDone in front of the opening of the carotid canal, and from the posterior and inferior aspect of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and passing down by the side of the posterior nares spreads out be- tween the fasciculi of origin of the palato- pliaryngeus ; it is in- serted into the middle line, where it is con- tinuous with the miiscle of the opposite side and is overlaid F^*^" ^QS'â€”Muscles of the palate.

The TENSOR PALATI {drcumfiexus) is a slender and flattened muscle ; it arises from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, the edge of the tympanic plate of the temporal bone, and from the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube. It lies between the in- ternal pterygoid muscle and internal pterygoid plate; the tendon winds around the hamular process of the latter, and expands into an aponeurosis, which is inserted into the transverse ridge on the horizontal portion of the palate bone, by means of the palatine aponeurosis. The tendon as it passes round the hamular process is contained in a synovial sheath. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle; by its internal surface with the levator palati, internal pterygoid plate, and superior constrictor. In the soft palate, its tendinous expansion is placed in front of the other muscles, and in contact with the mucous membrane. Nerve-supply.â€”From the otic ganglion, the motor root of which is the facial nerve. Palatine Aponeurosis.â€”A firm but not well-defined elastic mem- brane extends from the posterior border of the palate ]Dlate into the velum of the palate ; it thins as it descends, and at the sides becomes continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis. It gives attachment to portions of all the palatine muscles. The AZYGOS UVULAE (motor uvulce) is a pair of small muscles situated along the mid-line of the soft palate. They arise from the spine of the palate bone and aponeurosis of the soft palate, and are inserted into the uvula. By their anterior surface they are in re- lation with the levatores palati, palato-glossi, and anterior fasciculus of the ]Dalato-pharyngei; posteriorly they have the thin posterior fasciculus of the palato-pharyngei and the mucous meml^rane. Nerve-supply.â€”Probably from Meckel's ganglion, the nerve fibres being, however, ultimately traceable to the facial nerve. Dissection.â€”The two next muscles are brought into view by raising the mucous membrane from the pillars of the soft jjalate at each side. The PALATO-GLOSSUS {constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fasciculus of fibres, which arises in the soft jialate as a radiated expansion continuous with its fellow of the ojjposite side ; and descends to be inserted into the side of the tongue, Avhere its fibres mingle with those of the transverse lingualis. It is the prominence of this small muscle, covered by mucous meuiTirane, that constitutes the anterior jiillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium, from a function it perforins in common with the palato-pharyngeusâ€”viz., constricting the opening of tlie fauces. The PALATO-PHARYNGEUS {constrictor isthmi faucium posterior) forms the j)Osterior pillar of the fauces; it arises by two fasciculi from the raphe of the soft palate, where its fibres are continuousMECHANISM OF DEGLUTITION. 26s with tliose of the muscle of tlie opposite side ; and is inserted with the stylo-pharyngens into the inner surface of the pharynx and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is broad above where it forms the whole thickness of the lower half of the soft palate, narrow in the posterior pillar, and again broad and thm in the pharynx where it spreads out preyiously to its insertion. The levator palati passes to its insertion lietween the two fasciculi of origin of this muscle. Relations.â€”In the soft palate it is in relation with the mucous membrane both by its anterior and posterior surface ; above, with the levator palati, and heloiv, with the mucous glands situated along the margin of the arch of the palate. In the posterior ]nllar, it is sur- rou]ided for tAvo-thirds of its extent by mucous membrane. In the pharynx, it is in relation by its outer surface with the superior and middle constrictor muscle, by its inner surface vnth the mucous membrane. Nerve-supply.â€”The palato-glossus is supplied by the facial nerve, and the palato-pharyngeus from Meckel's ganglion and the pharyngeal plexus. Actions.â€”The azygos uvulae shortens the uvula. In speaking and singing, the uvula is by its muscles placed in contact with the posterior wall of the j^harynx, and in that position serves to steady the palate and prevent the vibration of its edge. The levator palati raises the soft palate, while the tensor spreads it out laterally 80 as to form a septum between the pharynx and posterior nares. Tlie palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus constrict the opening of the fauces, and drawing down the soft palate, serve to press the mass of food from the dorsum of the tongue into the pharynx. The action of the i^haryngeal muscles on the Eustachian tube has been much debated ; the generally received view is, that while the lower opening is always in some measure patent, it is distinctly enlai'ged by these muscles in the act of swallowing. Mechanism of Deglutition.â€”Deglutition is performed by means of the tongue and the muscles of the soft palate, fauces, and pharynx. The food bolus is pushed towards the fauces by the application of the tongue to the hard palate, the base of the tongue being also carried upwards and backwards by the action of the stylo-glossus muscles ; in this way the bolus is caused to pass between the anterior pillars of the fauces, the muscles of which (the palato-glossi) contract upon it._ Tlie palato-pharyngeus muscles forming the posterior pillars of the fauces also contract and narrow the faucial opening, the interval between them being filled up by the uvula ; the tensor palati muscles make tense, and the levator palati draAv upwards and backwards the soft palate till it nearly touches the posterior wall of the pharynx, thus ])reventing the food from passing upwards to the nasal cavity. At the same time the larynx is drawn upwards beneath the lower jaw by the elevator muscles of the os hyoides, and the thyroid cartilage is carried beneath the hj^oid bone 'by the thyro-hyoid muscles so as to allow the epiglottis to fall over the266 PRiEVERTEBRAL MUSCLES, upper opening of the larynx, tliis being facilitated by tlie tonLnie being earned backwards and the glosso-epiglottic folds rendered fax ilie lood, l)eing thus prevented from passing into the nose oi- larynx- is tlirown into the grasp of the constrictors of the pharynx, whiclJ successively contract upon it from above downwai'ds, so as to pass it into tlie up})er part of the o^sopliagus.

Eighth Group.â€”Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Part VII. MUSCLES AND FASCI/E OF THE TRUNK. The nuiscles of the trunk may l)e subdivided into four natural groups, viz. :â€” 1. Muscles of the l)ack. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perinajum.269 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. I. Muscles of the Back.â€”The region of the bach, in consequence of its extent, is common to the neck, upper extremities, and abdo- men ; and its muscles, which are numerous, may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. Dissection.â€”The muscles of this layer are to be dissected by making an incision along the middle line of the back, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the coccyx. From the u.pper end of this incision carry a second transversely outwards to the back of the ear ; inferiorly an incision must be made from the extremity of the sacrum, along the crest of the ilium, to about its middle. For convenience of dissection, a fourth may be carried from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra to the acromion process. The integument and superficial fascia, together, are to be dissected off the muscles in the course of their filires, over the whole of this region. Fasciae.â€”The superficial fascia of this region is continuous with that of the rest of the body; it is of considerable thickness and strength, and contains much pinkish fat. The deep fascia forms a dense fil^rous layer which is attached to the superior curved line of the occipital bone, tlie spines of the vertebra?, S2)ine of the scapula, crest of the ilium, and sacrum ; it is closely connected with the muscles, for which it forms sheaths, and is continuous with the deep cervical fascia and with the deep fascia of the abdominal and thoracic walls. The TRAPEZIUS muscle {trapezium, a quadrangle with unequal sides) arisKS from the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchte, and from the supra- spinous ligament and spinous processes of the last cervical and all tlie dorsal vertebrae. The fibres converge from these various points, the upper and lower being oblic[ue, and the middle nearly horizontal, and are inserted into the scapxdar third of the clavicle, acromion process, and upper border of the spine of the scapula, as far back as its tubercle. Over the two lower cervical and two upper dorsal spines the origin is markedly aponeurotic, so as to present the appear- ance of a tendinous ellipse. The lower fil^res of the muscles termi- nate in a flattened tendon which plays over the smooth triangular area at the root of the spine of the scapula. When the trapezius is dissected on both sides, the two muscles resemble a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle, on the posterior part of the shoulders ; hence the muscle was formerly named cucullaris (cucullus, a monk's cowl). Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, to which it is closely adherent by its cervical portion, loosely by its dorsal portion.

The anterior border of the cervical portion forms the posterior houndary of the posterior triangle of the neck. Its clavicular insertion sometimes advances to the middle of the clavicle, or as far as the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, and occasionally it has been seen to overlap the latter. This is a point to be borne in mind in the operation for ligature of the sub- clavian artery. The spinal accessory nerve passes beneath the anterior border, near the clavicle, previously to its distribution to the under surface of the muscle. Nerve-supply.â€”Spinal accessory, and third and fourth cervical. The ligamentum nuchas is a band composed of white fibrous tissue extended from the tubercle and spine of the occipital bone I to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it I is continuous with the supraspinous ligament. It is connected with the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebra, excepting the atlas, by means of a series of small fibrous slips ; and is the liomologue of an important elastic ligament in animals. The LATISSIMUS DORSI muscle covers the whole of the lower part of the back and loins. It arises from the spinous processes of the six inferior dorsal, and all the lumbar vertebrae, from the I supraspinous ligament, spinous tubercles of the sacrum, posterior third of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, and four lower ribs ; the latter origin taking place by muscular slips, which in- digitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive origin convei'ge as they ascend, and cross tlie inferior angle of the scaj)ula ; they then curve around the lower border of the teres major muscle, and terminate in a short f[uadi'ilateral tendon, which gets in front of the tendon of the teres, and is inserted into the l)icipital groove of the humerus. The tendinous origin of the muscle is united by its under surface with the posterior lamella of the fascia lumborum. A synovial bursa is interposed between its upper border and the lower angle of the scapi;la, and another between the upper half of its tendon and that of the teres major ; the two tendons being united in- I feriorly. The muscle frequently receives a small fasciculus from ' the scapida as it crosses its inferior angle ; its tendon also gives ' off fil)res to the deep fascia of the u])per arm. In many instances, a muscular slip arises from the edge of the : latissimus where it forms the posterior fold of the axilla, and cross- I ing the axillary artery terminates by joining the under surface of Ithe pectoralis major, or the coraco-bi-achialis. This is called the : musculus axillaris (dorsi-axillaris of Macalister). At the upper border of the latissimus is a small triangular I interval {triangle of Glarh), bounded above by the lower border of Uhe rhomboideus major, within by the trapezius, and below by the latissimus dorsi ; in this space the ribs and intercostal muscles are seen to l)e uncovered by the muscles of the back.

The latissimus dor^i. with the tei'es major, forms tlie posterior Ijorder of the axilla. Nerve-supply.â€”By the long subscapular branch of tlie posterioi- cord of the brachial plexus, and by the posterior branches of tlic dorsal and lumbar nerves. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulae, Rhomboideus minor, Ehomboideus major. Dissection.â€”This layer is brought into view by dividing the twn preceding muscles near their origin, and turning them aside. The LEVATOR ANGULI SCAPULA arises, by tendinous slips, from tlie posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four upper cervical vertebra); and is inserted into the upper angle and jjostei-ior bordei- of the scapula, as far as the triangular smooth surface at the root of its spine. Being the principal elevator of the shoulder, it has been termed musculus patientice. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface mth the trapezius, sterno- mastoid, and integument. By its deep surface with the splenius colli, traiisversalis cervicis, cervicalis ascendens, scalenus posticus and seri'atus posticus superior, and with the superlicialis colK and ])Osterior scapular arteries. The tendons of origin are interjjosed Ijetween the attachments of the scalenus medius in fi-ont and the splenius colli and transversalis cervicis behind. Nerve-supply.â€”By the rhomboid branch of the brachial plexus, and branches from the second, third, and fourtli cervical. The RHOMBOIDEUS MINOR (rhombus, a pai-allelogram with four equal sides) is a narrow slip of muscle, detached from the rhom- boideus major by a slight areolar interspace. It arises from the spinous processes of the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae and ligamentum nuclise ; and is inserted into the edge of the triangular surface on the ])osterior border of the scapula. The RHOMBOIDEUS MAJOR arises from the spinous proces.<5es and sui^ra-spinous ligaments of the four upper dorsal vertebrte, and is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula as far as its infeiior angle. The insertion is eftected by means of a tendinous band, whicli is attached above to the triangular surface at the root of the spine, below to the inferior angle, and betAveen these points to the jiosterior border of the scapula by means of a thin membrane. Relations.â€”By their superficial surface the rhomboid muscles are in relation with the trapezius, and the rhomboideus major with the latissimus dorsi and integument; l)y their deep surface with the serratus posticus superior, erector sjiina;, ]X)sterior scajnilar artery, intercostal muscles and ribs.SERRATUS POSTICUS MUSCLES. 273 Nerve-supply â€”The rhomboid imiscles are supplied by a branch of the brachial plexus called rliomboid ; it is derived from the fifth cervical. Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior, Herratus posticus inferior, Splenius. Dissection.â€”The third layer consists of muscles which arise from the spinous processes of the verteln'al column, and pass outwards. It is brought into view by dividing the levator anguli scapulae near its insertion, and reflecting the two rhomboid muscles upwards from their insertion into the scapula. The latter muscles sliould now be removed. Tlie SERRATUS POSTICUS SUPERIOR is situated at the upper part of the thorax ; it arises from the ligamentum nuchai and spinous processes of the last cervical and two upper dorsal vertebrae. The muscle passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted by four serrations into the upper border of the second, third, fourth, alid fifth riha, a little beyond their angle. Eelations.â€”By its superficial surface with the trapezius, rhom- boideus major and minor, and serratus nuignus. By its dee2J surface \\-ith the splenius, erector s])inÂ£io, intercostal muscles and riljs. The SERRATUS POSTICUS INFERIOR arises from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the two lowev dorsal and two or three upper lumbar vertebrae, and jjassing obliquely up- wards, is inserted by four serrations into the lower border of the four inferior ril)S. Both muscles consist of a thin aponeurosis for about half their extent. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the latissinurs dorsi, its tendinous origin being inseparabh' connected with the aponeurosis of that niuscle. By its deep surface with the erector spinas, inter- costal muscles, and lower ribs. The up2jer border is continuoiis â– with a thin tendinous layer, the vertebral aponeurosis. Nerve-supply.â€”The serrati muscles are supplied by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves. The vertebral aponeurosis is a thin membranous expansion, composed of transverse and longitudinal fibres, extending from the u]iper border of the serratus posticus inferior upwards beneath the serratus posticus superior to the neck, where it is lost in the cei'vi- cal fascia. It is attached along the middle line to the spinous pro- cesses of the dorsal vertebrae, externally to the angles of the ribs, and l)ecomes continuous below with the strong aponeurosis, called luml)ar fascia, which contains the erector spinae and deep muscles of tlie back. Dissection.â€”The serratus posticus superior must be removed from its origin and turned outwards, to bring into view the whole extent of the splenius muscle. SSPLENIUS, Tlie SPLENIUS muscle is single at its oririn, but divides soon alter into two jjortions, which are destined to distinct imertions, ll arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nucha?, the spinous process of the last cervical, and spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the six upper dorsal vertehraj; it divides as it ascends the neck into the splenius cajjitis and splenius colli. The splenius capitis is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone beneath the superior curved line, and posterior border of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The splenius colli is inserted into tlie posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrfe. The splenius is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a triangular interval in which is seen the complexus. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sterno- mastoid, levator anguli scapulaj, rhomboideus minor and major, and serratus posticus superior. By its deep surface with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis colli, complexus, trachelo- mastoid, and transversalis cervicis. Nerve-supply.â€”The great occipital, and the external branches of the posterior di\dsions of the cervical and five upper dorsal nerves. Fourth Layer. Erector sjjinse. Cervicalis ascendens. Transvei'salis cerA'icis. Trachelo-mastoid. Complexus. Dissection.â€”The two serrati and two sj)lenii muscles must be removed by cutting them away from their origin and insertion, and the vertebral aponeurosis laid open, to bring the fourth layer into view. The muscles of the fourth layer form the greater part of the musculai' mass which fills up the great vertebral groove on each side of the spine ; they are often described collectively under the name of erector spinse ; but this title should correctly be limited to the fleshy and tendinous mass which sjirings from the Ijack of the jielvis and the lumbar vertebrae. When the erector spinse reaches the level of the last rib, the greater part of it di^ddes to form two muscular columns, the outer receiving the name of sacro-lumbalis, the inner of longissimus dorsi; these are continued as they ascend into the muscles of the upper part of the back and neck, their relation to each other being indicated in the subjoined statement. To these two columns a third is added, forming the spinalis dorsi; it is placed the most internally of the three, and is limited to the dorsal and upper lumbar region.ERECTOR SPINiE. * 275 Erector Spinaj. Sacro-lumbalis, Lougissimus dorsi, Spinalis clorsi. Musciilus accessorius, Transversalis cervicis, Cervicalis ascendens. Traclielo-mastoid, The ERECTOR SPINJE arises from tlie posterior third of the crest of the ilium, the oblique sacro-iliac ligament, articular and spinous : tubercles of the sacrum, spinous processes and transverse processes of â–  the lumbar vertebrae ; the external portion being fleshy, the internal I tendinous. The tendinous portion is broad and flat, and gives origin I by its deep surface to a considerable part of tlie muscular fibres. In the lumbar region, the muscle proceeding from this extensiA'e origin is a broad and thick musculo-tendinous mass, on the surface of which, op23osite the last lib, a line of separation is apparent, tlie I outer portion, about one-third, l)eing the sacro-lumbalis, the inner ] two-thirds the longissimus dorsi. The sacro-lumbalis (ilio-costalis) ascends upon the chest inter- nally to the angles of the ribs, and is inserted by separate slips, the four upper tendinous, the two lower fleshy, into the angles of the six lower ribs. If this muscle be tiu'ued a little outwards, a number of tendinous : slips will be seen which take their origin from the upper border of the ribs near their angles, and terminate in muscular fasciculi, which l)rolong the sacro-lumbalis to the upper part of the chest. This is the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem ; it arises from the six lower ribs, and is inserted by separate tendons into the angles of the six upper ribs and transA^erse ju'ocess of the seventh cerAdcal j vertebra. The longissimus dorsi is inserted by two series of tendons, in- ternal and external; the internal being implanted into the accessory and transverse processes of all the lumbar, and transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae ; the external into the transverse processes I of the luinbar vertebrae, and all the ribs, excepting the first, be- I tween their tubercles and angles. ' I _ The spinalis dorsi is situated at the inner side of the lono-i.s- I simus dorsi, and arises from the spinous processes of the two uiiper ; lumbar and two lower dorsal vertebra3; it is inserted into the spinous processes of tlie upper dorsal vertebrae froni the second to the sixth or eighth. It also receives several fasciculi from the longissimus I dorsi and semi-spinalis dorsi. The two muscles form an ellipse I which einliraces the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrte. ' ' The lumbar fascia, with the spinal column, aponeurosis of the ' latissimus dorsi, and ribs, forms a complete osseo-aponeurotic sheath : tor the erector spinae. I The CERVICALIS ASCENDENS vel descendens is the continua- iMUSCLES OF THE BACK. 276 tion of tlie .sacro-luiubalis upwards into the neck. It arises from the angle of the third, fourtli, fifth, and .sixtli ribs, and is inserk'l by slender tendons into the posterioi tul^ercles of the transverse processes uf tlie third, fourtli, lifth, and sixtli cervical vertebra). The term de- scendens, applied to this muscle, can oidy be correct when it is de- scriljed as arising in the neck and passing downwards to the ril)s. Tlie TRANSVERSALIS CERVICIS appears to be the continuation uj}- wards into the neck of tlielongissimiif? dorsi; it aiHses from tlie trans\^erse ]n'ocesses of the five or six upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the trans- verse processes of the cerA'ical verte- brae, from the second to the sixth. It receives a fasciculus from the longissimus dorsi and se\-eral small slij)s from the trachelo-iuastoid. The TRACHELO-MASTOID is like- ^\'ise a continuation upwards from the longissimus dorsi. It is a slen der and delicate muscle, arising Ivor the transverse processes of the tlu-e upper dorsal and last cervical, an from the articular processes of tli three next cervical vertebne, i origin being similar to that of tli Fii:. 197.â€”Fuurtli, fifth, and part of the sixth hiyer of the muscles of the back. i.

Nerve-supply.â€”Thisand thepre muscles are supplied by th external branches of the posterio divisions of the dor.sal and cervic nerves. The COMPLEXUS is a large lauscl forming with the splenius the grea bulk of the back of the neck. I crosses the direction of the splenius, ceding arising from the transverse processes of the three upper dorsal and last cervical, and from the articular processes of the fourth, fiftUiMUSCLES OF THE FIFTH LAYER 277 and sixth cervical vertebrae ; and. is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone between the two curved lines, as far as the occipital spine. The complexus is marked in the upper part of the neck by a transverse tendinous intersection. A large fasciculus of the complexus lying sujjerficially to the rest of the muscle, and remarkable for consisting of two fleshy bellies with an intermediate tendon, is usually described under the name of biventer cervicis. Considered as a separate muscle, it arises by three or four slips from tlie transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, from the fourth to the seventh ; and is inserted into the inner j^oi'tion of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Nerve-supply.â€”The gTeat occipital, and internal branches of j)Osterior divisions of the six lower cervical and five upper dorsal nerves. Fifth Layer. Semi-spinales, Rectus posticus major. Rectus posticus minor, Rectus lateralis, Obliquus inferior, Obliquus sujjerior. Dissection.â€”The muscles of the preceding layer are to be re- moved by dividing them transversely througli 'the middle, and turning one extremity xip-\\'ards, the other clownwards. In this way the wliole of the muscles of the fourth layer may be dissected off, and tlie remaining muscles of the spine brought into a state to be examined. Tlie SEMI-SPINALES muscles are connected with the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebrÂ£)e, spanning one-half the verte- bral column ; hence their name, semi-spinales. The semi-spinalis dorsi arises from the transverse j^rocesses of the dorsal vertebra; from the sixth to the tenth ; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the four upper dorsal and two lower cevyi- cal vertebra). It is united below with the spinalis dorsi, and above with the semi-spinalis colli; it also sends several small slips to the longissimus dorsi. Tlie semi-spinalis colli, larger than the preceding, arises from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal vertebrte â€¢ and IS inserted into the spinous processes of the cervical vertebra)'from the second to the fifth.

Dissection.â€”The semi-spinales muscles mu.st lie i-emoved to obtain a good view of the multitidus s]nna3, which lies lieneatli them, and lills up the concavity between the spinous and transver-se processes, the whole length of the vei-tebral column.279 DEEP LAYER OF MUSCLES. The MULTIFIDUS SPIN^, consisting of about twenty-two small muscular fasciculi, extends along the vertebral groove from the sacrum to the axis. The muscle commences by tendinous fibres on the dorsum of the sacrum, proceeding from the lateral tubercles of the sacrum and even from the lateral cornu of the coccyx, and passing obliquely upwards and inwards to the spinous tubercles. The fasciculi arise inferiorly from the sacrum, ilium, and tendon of the erector spinse ; in the lumbar region from the articular and mammillary processes of the vertebrae ; in the dorsal region from the transverse jjrocesses; and in the cervical region from the arti- cular processes of the four inferior vertebrae. They are inserted into the spinous processes and laminae of all the vertebrae from the sacrum to the axis. Of the twenty-two fasciculi, six are lumbar, twelve dorsal, and four cervical. Each fasciculus, separate below, spreads out as it ascends, and passing over the next vertebra, is inserted into the four or five immediately above it. The muscle is thick inferiorly; and the uppermost fasciculus larger than those im- mediately below it. The ROTATORES SPINiE are situated in the dorsal region beneath the multifidus spinas; they are eleven in number, and arise from the upper and back part of the transverse processes, and are inserted into the laminae and roots of the spinous processes. The INTERSPINALES are small muscular slips arranged in pairs and situated l)etween the spinous processes of the vertebrse. In tlie cervical region there are six pairs of these muscles, the first being placed ))etween the axis and third vertel^ra, the sixth between tlie last cervical and first dorsal; they are attached to the apices of the spinous processes, and are separated by the interspinous liga- ments. In the dorsal region, rudiments of these muscles are occasion- ally met with between the upper and lower vertebrte, but are absent in the rest. In the hmbar region there are six pairs of interspinales, the first pair occupying the interspinous space between the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae, the last, the space between the fifth lumbar and sacrum. They are thin, broad, and imperfectly developed. Rudimentary interspinales are occasionally met with between the sacrum and coccyx ; these are the analogues of the caudal muscles of brutes ; in man they are named collectively the extensor cnccygis (sacro-coccygeus posticus). The INTER-TRANSVERSALES are small quadrilateral muscles situated between the transverse processes of the vertebra In the cervical region they are arranged in pairs corresiDonding with the double conformation of the transverse processes, the vertebral ar- tery and anterior dmsion of a cervical nerve lying between them Ihe rectus anticus minor and rectus lateralis represent the inter- transversales between tlie atlas and cranium. In the dorsal recdon tlie anterior mter-transversales are represented by the intercostal muscles while the posterior are mere tendinous bands, muscular only between the first and last vertebrcT. In the lumbar region, the anterior mter-transversales are thin, and occupv onlv part of theACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 28o space between the transverse processes. Homologues of posterior inter-transversales exist in the form of small muscular fasciculi extended between the mammillary process of the luml)ar vertebra). Nerve-supply.â€”The multihdus spinse, intersjjinales, and intei- transversales, are suijplied by branches from the posterior division > nf the spinal nerves, from the atlas to the sacrum. With regard to the origin and insertion of the muscles of the back, the student should be informed that no exact regularit}- attends their attachments. At the best, a knowledge of their precise connections, even were it possible to retain it, would be but a barren information, if not absolutely injurious, as tending to exclude more valuable learning. Actions.â€”The upper fibres of the trapezms draw the shoulder upwards and backwards ; the middle fibres, directly backwards ; the lower, downwards and backwards. The lower fibres also pro- duce rotation of the scapula on the chest, tilting the lower angle of that Ijone forwards and upwards, and carrying the upper angle slightly dowuAvards and in"\\"ards ; in this way tlie glenoid ca^dt}â€¢ is directed obliquely upwards and outwards, and the trapezius thus performs an important part in the eleA'ation of the arm above the shoulder. If the shoulder be fixed, the uj^per fibres will flex the spine towards the corresponding side. The latis- sirmis dorsi is a muscle of the arm, drawing it backwards and downwards, and at the same time rotating it inwards; if the arm be fixed, the latissinuis dorsi will draw the spine to that side, and, raising the lower ribs, be an inspiratory muscle ; and if both arms be fixed, the two muscles will draw the whole trunk forwards, as in climbing or wallving on crutches. By passing over the inferior angle of the scapula it binds that bone to the thoracic wall, and by being folded round the axillary border it limits the outward projection of the same angle when the arm is raised. The levator anguli scapuke lifts the upper angle of the scapula, and with it the entire shoulder ; the rhomboidei carry the scapula and shoulder upwards and backwards, and approximate the inferior angle of the scapula to the spine. The serrati are respiratory muscles acting in opposition to each other, the serratus posticus superior drawing the ribs upAvards, and thereby expanding the chest; the inferior drawing the loAver rilis dowuAvards, and diminishing the caA'ity of the chest. The former is an inspiratory, the latter an expiratory muscle. The qylenii muscles of one side draAV the \-erteliral column backAvards and to one side, and I'otate the head toAvards the corresponding shouldei'. The muscles of opposite sides acting together, draAV the head directly backwards. They are direct antagonists of the sterno- mastoid muscles. _ _ . The sacro-lumbalis Avith its accessory muscle, the longissimus tJor-^i and spinalis dorsi, are knoAvn by the general term of erector sjniKV, Avhich sufficiently expresses their action. They keep the spine suj)- ported in the vertical position by their broad origin from beloA\-,MUSCLES OF THE THOEAX. and by their insertion, by distinct tendons, into the ribs and spinous processes. Being made np of a number of distinct fasciculi, which act alternately, the sjiine is kept erect without fatigue, even when the muscles have to counterbalance a corpiilent abdomen. The continuations upwards of these muscles into the neck preserve the steadiness and uprightness of that region. When the muscles of one side act alone, the neck is rotated on its axis. The complexus, l)eing attached to the occipital bone, draws the head backwards, and counteracts the muscles of the anterior jDart of the neck. It assists also in the rotation of the head. The semi-spinalis and multifidus spina; muscles act directly on the vertebrae, and contribute to the general action of supporting the vertebral column erect. The four little muscles situated between the occiput and the first two vertebrae, effect the various movements between these bones ; the recti producing the antero-posterior actions, the obliqui the rota- tory motions of the atlas on the axis. The actions of the remaining muscles of the spine, the rotatores spince, interspinales and inter-transversales, are expressed in their names. They approximate their attachments, and assist the more powerful muscles in preserA-ing the erect position of the body. MUSCLES AND FASCI.E OF THE THORAX. The principal muscles situated on the front and sides of the thorax l^elong in their actions to the upper extremity, with which they will be described. They are the pectoralis major and minor, subclavius and serratus magnus. The true thoracic muscles, which appertain exclusively to the actions of the ribs, are theâ€” External intercostals, Subcostals, Internal intercostals, Triangularis sterni. Levatores costiirum. The intercostal muscles are two planes of muscular and tendinous fibres directed obliquely between adjacent ribs and closing the inter- costal spaces. They are seen partially on the reflection of the pec- toral muscles, oi- on the inner surface of the chest. The triangularis sterni IS within the chest, and requires tlie removal of the anterior part of the thorax to luring it into view. FASCiyK.â€”A thin layer of fascia covers the external surface of the external intercostal, and the inner surface of the internal muscle and a still finer layer is interposed between them. The surface layers l)ecome thicker in front, where the external intercostal is aencient, and behind, Avhere the internal intercostal is wanting The EXTERNAL INTERCOSTALS, eleven on each side, commence posteriorly at tlie tul^ercles of the ribs, and advance forwards to the costal cartilages, where they terminate in a thin anoumii-nsis (nv.fP.rrnr282 INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. intercostal membrane) which is continued onwards to the sternum. Their fibres are directed oljliquely downwards and forwards, pur- suing the same line with those of the external olilique muscle of the abdomen. Tliey are thicker than the internal intercostals, and more tendinous in stiaicture. The INTERNAL INTERCOSTALS, also eleven on each side, com- mence anteriorly at the sternum, and extend backwards as far a.s the angle of the rihs, whence they are prolonged to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis (posterior intercostal membrane). Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, correspond- ing with those of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen, and crossing those of the external intercostals. In structiire the intercostal muscles consist of an admixture of muscular and tendinous fibres. They arise from the two lips of the lower border of the rib, the external from the outer liji, the internal from the inner ; and are inserted into the upper border of the rib > lielow, encroaching somewhat on its surfaces. Nerve-supply.â€”The intercostal nerves. The SUBCOSTALS are nine or ten small muscles situated within the thorax at its posterior part, and lying upon the ribs. They increase in size from above downwards, and the direction of their fibres corresponds with that of the internal intercostals. Each muscle arises from the front of a rib, and is inserted into the front of the rib but one below. They are most constant on the lower ribs. Relations,â€”The external intercostals, by their external surface with the muscles which immediately invest the chest, viz., pectoralis major and minor, serratus magnus, serratus posticus sujierior and inferior, scalenus posticus, sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi Avith their continuations, cervicalis ascendens and transversalis cervicis, levatores costarum, and obliquus externus abdominis. By their in- ternal surface with the internal intercostals, intercostal vessels and nerves, and posteriorly witli the pleura, a thin layer of fascia being interposed. The internal intercostals, by their external surface with the external intercostals, and intercostal vessels and nerves ; by their internal surface with the costal pleura, triangularis sterni, subcostals, and diaphragm. The TRIANGULARIS STERNI, situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the side of the sternum, ensiform cartilage, and sternal extremities of the costal cartilages from the third to the sixth or seventh ; it is inserted by fieshy digitations into the second, third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages and corresponding ril)S. Relations.--By its external surface with the sternum, ensiforni cartilage, costal cartilages, internal intercostal muscles, and internal mammary vessels. By its internal surface with the costal ])leiira, areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, and diajihragm. The lower fibres of the triangularis sterni are continuous with those the transversalis abdominis. Nerve-supply.â€”The intercostal nerves.ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF KESPIEATION. 283 The LEVATORES COSTARUM are divided into long and short. The short, twelve in number at each side, arise from the apex and lower border of the transverse process of the last cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrfB ; and pass downwards and outwards radiating ill their descent, to be inserted into the upper border of all the ribs, between the tubercle and angle. The uppermost muscle is the smallest, and their breadth increases from above downwards. The long muscles, four in number at each side, arise from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebra, the seventh to the tenth, and are inserted into the four lower ribs ; each muscle passing over a rib in its descent, and being attached to the rib below as tar as its angle. The long muscles lie superficially to tlie sliort ones and increase in size from alDove do^TOAvards. Relations.â€”By their su-perjicial surface with tlie sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and transversalis cer- 'icis. By their deep surface with the ribs and intercostal spaces; the short muscles close the intercostal spaces, and are united by their ex- ternal border with the ex- ternal iiitercostals. Nerve - supply.â€”The posterior divisions of the dorsal iierA^es. Actions of the Respira- tory Muscles.â€”Respiration is produced by the alternate largement and diminu- tion of the capacity of the thorax ; the former result- ing in the influx of air, or inspiration, and the latter in an expulsion of air, or thoracic cavity takes in its three diameters, the vertical, trans- verse, and antero-posterior; the vertical measurement being in- creased by the descent of the diaphragm which forms the fioor of the cavity, and by the elevation of the first rib ; the transverse diameter hy the elevation and rotation of the ribs ; and the antero- posterior l)y the raising of tlie ribs and forward projection of the sternum. Ordinary tranquil inspiration is performed by the descent of the diaphragm and the elevation of the ribs and sternum by means of the intercostal muscles ; Avhen the act is more forcibly performed these are aided by the levatoi'es costarum, scalene muscles, and serratus posticus superior. In full inspiration the scapula is fixed by means of the muscles which connect it with the vertebral column ; the powerful muscles which pass from the shoulder to the Pi(i. igg.â€”Intercostal muscles and levatores cos- tarum.

The enlargement of the284 MUSCLES OF THE)ABDOMEN. ribs are then brought into play, and by their action elevate the ribs ; these are the pectoralis major and minor, serratus magnus, and latis- simus dorsi. Much difference of opinion prevails as to the action of the external and internal intercostals, many anatomists adliei'ing: to the theory taught l)y liamberger that the external are insjiiratory,. and the internal expiratory muscles ; while others accept tlie \ie\v so forcibly expounded by Hutchinson that the Avhole of tlie external and the part of the internal lying between the costal cartilages act in inspiration, and the rest of the internal intercostals in expiration. Duclienne, as the result of direct experiment on the muscles, sup- ported the theory that both muscles act in common as muscles of inspiration, by raising the ribs, and so increasing the capacity of the thorax ; and the same view has been adopted by Henle and Luschka. Ordinary tranquil expiration is not a muscular act, but an elastic and mechanical recoil, due to the elasticity of 1?he lung-substance and the recoil of the chest wall after the muscles of inspiration have ceased to act. In forced expiration all tlie muscles which depress the I'ibs are brought into action, more especially those forming the abdominal wall (ol)liqui, transversales, and recti), and the ti^iangularis sterni and sacro-lumbalis. Lastly, it shoiild be noted tliat certain muscles usually classed with those of expiration, from their being attached to the lower ribs, may in consequence of that attachment assist in inspii-ation, by giving a point of fixation and support for the act ion of the diaphragm ; such are the serratus posticus inferior and quad- ratus lumborum. The levatores costarum are generally regarded as muscles of inspiration, but Von Elmer considers them to be chieliy brought into play in lateral flexion of the dorsal spine. MUSCLES AND FASCIAE OF THE ABDOMEN. The nauscles of the abdominal region are theâ€” Obliquus externus (descendens), Rectus, Obliquus internus (ascendens), Pyramidalis, Cremaster, Quadratus lumborum, Ti-ansversalis, Psoas parvus. mi Diaphragm. Dissection.â€”The dissection oP the abdominal muscles is to be commenced by making three incisions:â€”The first, vertical, in the middle line, from over the lower part of the sternum to the pubes; the second, transverse, from the top of the first incision aci-oss the cheBt, as far back as the, knife can be carried ; the third, ohhqne, from the umbilicus, downwards and outwards, to the anterior supe- rior spine of the ilium. The three fla]is included by these incisions should then be dissected liack in the direction of the libres of the external oblique muscle, beginning at the angle of each. Tlie in- tegument and superflcial fas'cia should be dissected off separately, so jis'^to enal)le the student to examine the relation of the vessels to the parts connected with hernia.Fi<;. 200.â€”Muscles of the .-interior aspect of the trunk ; on the left side thc'supcrfici.-il layer is seen, on the right the deeper layer, i.

As it descends it becomes tliickei', mor elastic, and very fatty, and is continued into tlie su])erficial fascia o the thigh. Over the jniljes tlie fascia contains much coarse-gi-ained fat, but as it passes on to the penis this ceases, and is I'eplaced by elastic tissue; and on its continuation into the scrotum, a layer of uustrii)ed muscular tissue takes the jilace of the fat, forming the tunica dartos. Along the linea alba and in the groin, fine filji'ous bands connect the superficial fascia with the deep layer and with the aponeurosis of the external oblique. Branches of the superficial epigastiic, superficial external pudic, and superficial circumflex iliac arteries and their companion "S'eins ramify in the substance of the fascia, and the superficial lymphatic vessels are distributed throughout it; in the groin it lodges the inguinal lymjihatic glands. The deep fascia {Scar-pa's fascia) lies on the abdominal aponeurosis, a thin layer of connective tissue being interposed. It is continued ligament, but about half an inch farther down the thigh. The deep fascia is continued down into the scrotum, where it forms a sheath for the testicle, the processes from the two sides coml)iniug in the middle line to form the septum scroti. In the perineum it becomes inseparable from the deep layer of the superficial fascia of that region (fascia of CoUes), and is attached to the ramus of _ the pubes on each side. From this description it folloA\-s that if air or fiiiid be forced under the deep fascia, it will tra\-el through the connective tissue all over the abdomen, and could reach the scrotum and peri- neum, but could not pass down the thigh, being prevented by tlie connection of the fascia with the rami of the i)ubes, and the attacli- , inent of the fascia lata in the groin ; it would, moreover, be pre- vented from infiltrating the Imck part of the i)erineum by the deej) laver of the superficial fascia being united to the deep perineal fascia alono- the posterior edge of the transverse perineal muscle. Linea Alba, &c.â€”AVhen the external ol)licpie muscle is dis.sected on both sides, a white tendinous line will be seen along the middle of the abdomen, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes ; jp^r tachment a triangular piece is pi'o- 'h I longed to the dorsum of the penis, I and is called the suspensory liga- upwards over the abdomen, being closely adherent to the linea alba.

The EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE (ohliqiius extermis abdominis, descendens) is the extei'ual ilat muscle of the aljdomen. Its name is derived from the obliquity of its direction, and the descending course of its fibres. It arises by flesliy digitations from the external surface of the eight inferior ribs ; the five upper digitations being288 EXTERNAL ABDOMINAL RING received between corresponding jiroceHses of the serratus niagiuiB the three lower, of the lati.ssinius doi-si. The fleshy fasciculi pro- ceeding from this extensive origin tei'iuinate on the front of the abdomen in a broad aponeurosis, and ])Osterioi'ly are inserted into the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for the anterior two-third length, and into the anterior superior spinous process. Tlie uj.<j- neurosis is united, in front, by its under surface, with tliat of tlie obhquus internus, forming the anterior wall of the sheath of the rectus, and is ivserted into the linea allia, front of the pubes, sjjine of the ]uibes, and pectineal line. The lower border of the aponeurosis, whicli is stretched between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the spine of the pubes, is round from being folded inwards, and forms Poupart's ligament; the insertion into the pectineal line is Gimbernat's ligament. Just above the crest of the pubes is the external abdominal ring, a triangular opening formed by tlie separation of the filjres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is oljlitpie in direction, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It is bounded l)elow by the crest of the i)ubes ; on either side by the borders of the aponeurosis, which are termed pillars; and above In- some curved fibres (intercohomnar) which originate from Poupart's ligament, and cross the ujiper angle of the ring, to give it strength. 'Jlie external pillar, which is at the same time inferior from the obliquity of the opening, is inserted into tile spine of the ]nil)es; the internal or superior p)illar forms an interlacement with its fellow of the opposite side over the front of the symplwsis pubis. The inner fibres of the outer pillar pass behind the spermatic cord and internal pillar of the ring, and expanding into a thin triangular sheet interlace with the corresponding' fibres of the opposite side on the back j)art of the crest and symphysis pubis ; they receiA e the name of triangular fascia. The external abdominal ring gi\ es passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female : they are both invested in their passage through it by a prolongation of the intercolumnar fil)res of the external obli<{ue muscle, the intercolumnar fascia, or spermatic fascia. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the superficial fascia, integument, cutaneous vessels and nerves, particularly the super- ficial epigastric and superficial circumflex iliac A'essels, and latissinius dorsi, by which it is overlapjied posteriorly. By its internal surface with the internal oblique, lower part of the eight inferior i-il>s and intercostal muscles, cremaster, sjjerinatic cord in the male, and romid ligament in the female. The upper boi'der of the external oblique is continuous with the pectoralis major. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior branches of the lower intercostals. Dissection.â€”The external oblique is now to be removed by making an incision from the anterior siq^erior sj^ine of the ilium towards the umbilicus as fat as the aponeurosis can be sepai'feted from the subjacent muscle. From this latter point an incision is to289 INTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE. be made to the crest of the pubis, and the aponeurosis included in these incisions to be turned down to Poupart's ligament. The remainder of the muscle ihay be removed by carrying a perpen- dicular incision from the end of the first up to the chest, and dis-. secting off the aponeurosis and muscle. The INTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE (obliquus internus abdominis, ascendens) is the middle flat muscle of the abdomen. It arises from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, from the middle of the crest of the ilium for the anterior two-thirds its length, and from the fascia luniborum. Its fibres diverge from their origin, those from Pou- part's ligament curving downwards, those from the anterior -part of the crest of the ilium passing transversely, and the rest ascending obliquely. The muscle is inserted into the jjectineal line and crest of the pubes, linea alba, and lower border of the four inferior ribs. Along the upper three-fourths of the linea semilifiiaris, the apo- neurosis of the internal oblique separates into two lamellae, which pass one in front, the other behind the rectus muscle to the linea alba, where they are inserted ; the former of these unites mth the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and the latter with that of the transversalis. Along the lower fourth of the linea semilunaris, the' aponeurosis does not divide, but passes in front of the rectus. The lowest fibres of the internal oblique are inserted into the crest and pectineal line of the pubes in common with those of the trans- versalis muscle. Hence the tendon of this insertion is called the conjoined tendon of the interiml oblique and transversalis. This tendon is situated directly behind the external abdominal ring, and serves to strengthen what would otherwise be a weak point in the abdomen. Sometimes the tendon is insufficient to resist the internal pressiire, and is forced through the external ring ; it then forms the distinctive covering of direct inguinal hernia. Nerve-supply.â€”Ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric of first lumbar, and anterior branches of lower intercostal nerves. The spermatic cord passes beneath the arched border of the internal oblique muscle, between it and Poupart's ligament. The interval between this lower border and Poupart's ligament is there- fore called the spermatic or inguinal canal. During its passage some fibres are given oft' from the lower border of the muscle, which accompany the cord downwards to the testicle, and form loops around it; this is the cremaster muscle. The CREMASTER, considered as a distinct muscle, arises from the middle of Poupart's ligament, and forms a series of loops upon the spermatic cord. A few of its fibres are inserted into the tunica vagmalis ; the rest ascends along the inner side of the cord, to be inserted, with the conjoined tendon, into the crest of the pubes in front of the sheath of the rectus. Where the muscle spreads out over the tunica vaginalis and spermatic cord it receives the name of cremasteric fascia.

It arisen from the outer third of Poupart's ligament, from tlie anterior two-thirds of the internal lip of the crest of the ilium ; ri uni the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebi'te through the medium of the aponeurosis, and from the inner surface lit the six inferior costal cartilages, interdigitatiug with the fibres of tlie diajjliragm. The superior fibres, proceeding from the cartilage 111' the seventh rib, are inserted into the ensiform cartilage ; the Ulterior fibres, proceeding from Poujjart's ligament, curve down- wards to be inserted by means of a tendinous exjDansion common lo it, and the internal oblique, the conjoined tendon, into the crest of t he pubes and pectineal line ; while the fibres intermediate between these points terminate near,the outer border of the rectus in an apo- neurosis, which is continued onwards to the linea alba. The upper ] K irtion of the ajjoneurosis, closely united with the posterior lamella (if the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, assists in forming the ; II isterior wall of the sheath of the rectus, while the inferior portion, ' iiiiunencing at a point midway between the umbilicus and pubes, i> Lontinued with the undivided aponeurosis of the internal oblique in front of the rectus.

By its internal surface with the transversalis fascia, Avhich separates it from the peritoneum, with the psoas magnus, tlie lower part of the rectus, and pyraniidalis. The spermatic cord and oblique inguinal hernia pass beneath the loiver harder, but have no direct relation with it. The upper harder is continuous with the diaphragm and triangularis sterni. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior branches of lower intercostals. Lumbar Fascia.â€”The posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis divides into three lamellae, anterior, middle, and posterior, which constitute the fascia lumhorum. The anterior lamella, thin and membranous, is attached to the base of the transverse processes of tlie lumbar vertebree ; the middle lamella, of considerable thickness, to their apices ; the posterior layer receives the posterior aponeurosis of tlie internal oblique, and is attached to the spines of the lumbar vertebra3; near the Ijorder of the erector spina;, it becomes united with the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior. Between the anterior and middle lamella is lodged the quadratus lumborum ; and between the middle and posterior layer, the erector spinse and multifidus spina?, which are thus furnished with aponeurotic sheaths. The anterior layer is attached above to the lower margin of the last j-ib and forms the lUjamentum arcuatum externum. Dissection.â€”To dissect the rectus muscle, its sheath should be opened by a vertical incision extending from over the cartilages of the lower ril)s to the front of the os pubis. The sheath may then he dissected ott and turned aside ; this is easily done excepting at292 'MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. the Imese transversse, wliero a close adhesion exists between the muscle and the external wall of the sheath. The RECTUS ABDOMINIS arises by a double tendon from the iront and crest of the os pubis, and is inserted by three broad digitations into the outer surfaces of the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. It is traversed by several tendinous in- tersections, called linese transversse (inscriptiones tendineaj).

The union of these three fasciae takes place rather "under than in Poupart's ligament, which could therefore be cut away, leaving them connected together as a firm fibrous cord, to which is given the name of deep crural arch. At the inner half of Poupart's ligament it is prolonged into the thigh, fornnng the anterior part of the sheath of the femoral vessels, as the posterior part is formed of a similar prolongation of the iliac fascia. The internal abdominal ring is an opening in this fascia situ- ated about half-way between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symj)hysis of the pubis, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. It is oval in form, the lower edge being strong, the upper thin and Aveak. Through this opening the sper- matic cord in the male jjasses to the testicle, and the round liga- ment of the uterus in the female to its insertion over the pubis. From the edges of the ring a funnel-shaped tube of transversalis fascia is given off which surrounds the structures forming the sper- matic cord. This is the infundibuliform fascia, sometimes called the fascia propria of the cord. The internal abdominal ring, there- fore, is simply the funnel-shaped mouth of this tube, and it is situated immediately external to the deep epigastric artery round which the spermatic cord turns in its passage from the abdomen to the scrotum. Inguinal Canal.â€”The spermatic or inguinal canal, which in the normal condition of the abdominal jiarietes serves for the passage of the s])ermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament with its vessels in the femak, is about one inch and a half in length. It is bounded, in front, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique nuiscle and a few fibres of the internal oblique and cremaster : hehind, by the transversalis fascia, the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis, and triangular fascia ; above, by the arched border of the internal oblique and transversalis ; below, by the gi-ooved border of Poupart's ligament and the upper surface of Gimbernat's ligament; and at each extremity by one of the abdominal rings, the internal ring at the inner, the external ring at the outer extremity. These relations may be more distinctlv illustrated by the following plan :â€” Above. Lower border of internal oblique and transversalis. In front.

In OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA the intestine follows the same course as is pursued by the testicle in its descent, and obtains the same coverings as that organ. It escapes from the cavity of the abdomen into the spermatic or inguinal canal, through the internal abdominal ring, pressing before it a pouch of peritoneum whicli constitutes the hernial sac, and distending the infundibuliform pro- cess of the transversalis fascia. After emerging through the internal abdominal ring it passes firstly beneath the lower and arched bordei- of the internal oblique muscle ; and then through the external abdo- FiG. 207.â€”Diagram of a common scro- tal hernia, show- ing the relation of the sac to the tunica vaginalis testis.

Common obliciue hernia is that which has been described above. Congenital hernia results from the non-closure of the pouch of peritoneum carried downwards into the scrotum by the testicle, uring its descent in the foetus. In consequence of this defect, the intestine at some period of life is forced into the peritoneal canal, and descends through it into the tunica vaginalis, where it lies in contact with the testicle ; so that congenital hernia has 710 proper sac, but is contained within the tunica vaginalis. The other coverings are the same as those of common inguinal hernia. In the female, congenital hernia descends into the canal of Nuck. Infantile hernia is that form of protrusion in which the j^ouch (if pei'itoneum forming the tunica vaginalis is only partially closed. The connection with the alxlomea is completely closed at the inguinal canal, but the rest of the tube remains in its original state, and when a hernia makes its way into the scrotum it lies liehind the en- closed tunica A^aginalis. So that the surgeon, in ojiei'ating upon this variety, requires to divide tlu-ee layers of serous membrane ; the hrst and second layer being those of the tunica vaginalis, the third the true sac of the hernia. A variety of this form is called encysted hernia ; in it, the hernial sac is invaginated into the incompletely closed tunica, as shown 111 Fig. 210. The surgeon has, therefore, to (hvide two layers of peritoneum before he reaches the bowel. , DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA has received its name from passing direct ly through the external abdominal ring, and forcing before ^lo-â€”Encysted hernia, it the opposing parietes.

The direct hernia passes through a triangular si)ace, bounded ou . the outer side by the deep epigastric artery, on the inner by tlie edge of the rectus muscle, and below by Poupart's ligament; thifi space is called the triangle of Hesselbach. All the forms of inguinal hernia are designated scrotal, when they have descended into the scrotum ; the oblique inguinal is most fre- quently found in this situation, from its follo\\-ing the com-se of the spermatic cord. MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR WALL OF THE ABDOMEN, AND DIAPHRAGM. Dissection.â€”The next two muscles can be examined only when the viscera of the al>domen are removed. To see the quadratus lumboruni, it is also necessary to divide and draw aside the psoas muscle and the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis. The QUADRATUS LUMBORUM will be seen to consist of two portions :â€”one, the external, arisixg from the ilio-lumbar ligament and adjoining part of the crest of the ilium for Uvo inches in extent, and inserted into the apices of the transverse processes of the four upper hunbar vertebrae (sometimes also last dorsal) and last rilj ; the other, the internal and anterior portion, arises l)y tendinous slijis from the transverse processes of the three or foui' lowev Imnbar vertebrae, and passes iqjwards to be inserted into the lower border of the last ril). if the muscle be cut across or removed, the middle lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis will be seen, attached to the apices of the transverse processes; the quadratus being en- closed between the two lamellae as in a sheath.

It is a transverse muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, and is composed of two portions, thoracic and lumbar. The thoracic portion arises from the ensiform cartilage by a distinct slip and from the internal surface of the six inferior ribs, interdigitatmg with the transversalis. The fibres converge to be inserted into the central tendon. A triangular interval exists between the sternal and costal portion of the muscle at each side, closed by a few irregular muscular fibres, some connective tissue, and by the serous membranes of the cavity of the chest and abdomen.

The psoas muscles. of the abdomen through this opening constitutes phrenic or dia- jihragmatic hernia. The lumbar portion consists of a right and left lateral half (crura) ; each of which is composed of three smaller pillars, inter- nal, middle, and external. The crura arise from tlie front and lateral aspect of the bodies of the first, second, and third lumbar vertebrae, from the intervertebral substance between the first, second, third, and fourth, from the transverse process of the first, ligainentum arcuatum internum and externum, and last rib. The left crus is shorter than the right by the breadth of a A'ertebra, and does not advance so far for^^ard on the front of the vertebral column. The crura are inserted into the whole length of the jDosterior border of the central tendon. The origin of the crura takes ])lace by a strong tendon, from whicli and from the other points of attachnient muscular fibres proceed. The internal pillar of the crus is its anterior fasciculus, which pro-300 DIAPHRAGM. ceeds fi-oiii tlie third lumbar vertebra; the middle pillar, smallei- than the otliers, i)roceeds from the second vertebra ; tlie external inilar, tlie largest of the three, from the first lumljar vertebra, liga- menta arcuata, and last rilx The internal pillars approach each other as they ascend, the arclied interval l)etween them being the aortic opening; their internal fibres, consisting of several fasciculi, cross each other in front of the aortic opening and form the lateral boundaries of another opening of elliptical shape (cesophageal), and are then lost in the central tendon.

Transverse processes of lumbar vertebife, and intertransverse muscles. aortic and resophageal o])eiiing the fibres of the i-ight internal jiillar are generally the most superficial. Muscular fibres are commonly found passing from the upper surface of the diaphragm on to the left side of the pericardial sac (Forbes). Between the lumbar and costal portion of the diapliragm at each side there is often a triangulai- interval like that between the costal and sternal portion, closed only by areolar tissue and the sei'ous membranes of the two cavities. The ligamentum arcuatum internum is a tendinous arch thrown across the upper jaart of the psoas muscle from the side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra to the apex of its trausvorscDIAPHRAGM. 301 process, extending sometimes also to that of the second. Beneath this arcli a psoas abscess emerges from the chest. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is a tendinous band ex- tended from the apex of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the lower border of the last rib. It forms an arch across the quadratus lumborum, and is a thickened part of the sheath of that muscle derived from the posterior aponeurosis of the trans- versalis alxlominis. The tendinous centre of the diaphragm is shaped like a trefoil leaf, of which the central leaflet points to the ensiform cartilage, and is the largest; the lateral leaflets, right and left, occupy the corre- sponding portions of the muscle ; the right being the larger and rounded, the left smaller and lengthened in its form. The openings in the diaphragm are three: one, quadrilateral, in the tendinous centre, at tlie union of the right and middle leaflets, for the passage of the inferior vena cava and a In'anch of the phrenic nerve; a muscular opening of an elliptical shape formed by the internal pillars of the crura, the uisophageal, for the transmission of the (esophagus and piieumogaatric nerves; a third, the aortic, formed by a tendinous arch thrown from the tendon of one crus to that of the other. Tlie latter opening is the largest, lowest, and most jjos- terior of the three; it is bounded behind by the vertebral column, and gi\'es passage to the aorta, vena azijgos major, and thoracic duct. The great splanchnic nerve passes through the diaphragm Ijetween the internal and middle pillar of the crus ; the lesser splanchnic nerve escapes between those fibres of the external pillar wliich pi'o- ceed from the ligamentuin arcuatmn internum. The s>'mpat]ietic chain passes into the abdomen beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum, and the vena azygos minor passes from the al)domen to the tlrorax through the left crus of tlae diaphragm. The diaphragm forms a dome, the con-^'exity of which is directed towards the thorax and the concavity towards the abdomen ; the right lialf lises to a higher level tlian the left, in consequence of Ijeing puslied upwards by the liver, and the central leaflet of the tendon is lower than the top of either half of the dome. During life, the level of the diaphragm varies with respiration and Avith the condition of the organs ; after death the top of the right half of the dome reaches to about a level with the lower border of the fourth rib, tlie left half to the upper edge of the fifth rib, and the central leaflet corresponds to the junction of the xiphoid cartilage with the sternum.

Actions of the Muscles of the Abdominal Wall and the Diaphragm.â€”The external olilique muscle, acting singly, draws the thorax towards the pelvis, and twists the l)ody to the opposite side. Both nuiscles, acting together, flex the thorax directly on the pelvis. The internal oblique of one side draws the chest do^\^lwards and out- wards ; lx)th together bend it directly forwards. Eitlier transversalis muscle, acting singly, will diminish" the size of the abdomen on its own side, and both together will consti'ict the entire cylinder of the ca\dty. The recti muscles tlex the thorax towards the peh'is, and, through the arrangement of their sheaths, combine with the obliqui; and transverse muscles in exercising ]jressure on the abdonunal viscera. The absence of the posterior layer of the .sheath of the rectus muscles below allows of direct pressure being bronglit to bear upon the bladder when full, and upon the uterus in partu- rition. The pyramidales are tensors of the linea all)a. The al)- doniinal are expirator}^ muscles, and chief agents in expulsion; by their action, the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the urine from the bladder, fa3ces from the rectum, bile from the gall-bladdei', ingesta from the stomach and bowels in vomiting, and mucus ancl irritating substances from the Ijronchial tubes, tracliea, and nasal passages during coughing and sneezing. To produce these effects, they all act together. The cpiadratus liunborum draws the last rib do^\'nwards, and is an expiratoi'y muscle ; it also serves to bend the A'ertebral column to one or the other side. The psoas parA'us is a tensor of the iliac fascia, and, taking its fixed origin from below, may assist in flexing the vertebral column forwards. The diaphragm is an insjDiratory muscle, and the sole agent in trantpiil insjiiration. When in action, the muscle is drawn downwards, its plane being rendered oblique from the level of the ensiform cartilage to that of the upper lumliar vertebra. During relaxation it is convex, and encroaches considerably on the cavity of the chest, particularly at the sides, where it corresponds with the lungs. It assists the abdonunal muscles powerfully in expulsion, every act of that kind being preceded or accompanied by inspiration. Spasmodic action of the diaphragm produces hiccough and sobbing, and its rapid alternation of contraction and relaxation, combined with laryngeal and facial movements, laughing and crying. MUSCLES AND FASCIvE OF THE PERINEUM. The muscles of the perineum are situated in the outlet of the pelvis, and consist of two groups, one of -which belongs esjiecially to the organs of generation and urethra, the other to the termination of the alimentary canal. To these may be added the muscles of the coccyx. The muscles of the perineal i-egion in the male are theâ€” Bulbo-cavernosus, Ischio-cavernosus, Transversus perinei. Compressor urethroc, Sj)hincter ani. Levator ani, Coccygeus.PERINEAL FASCIA. 303 Dissection.â€”To dissect the perineuiu, the subject sliould be lixed in the position for lithotoniy, that is, tlie hands should 1)6 bound to the soles of the feet, and the knees kept apart. Both of these means of preparation have for their object the full exposure of the perineum. And as this is a dissection which demands some degree of delicacy and nice manipulation, a strong light should be thrown upon the part. A large sound is to be introduced into the bladder, and a string, tied round the testicles, to be fixed to its handle. This will retain the sound in the bladder and put the pei'ineum on the stretch. An incision is to be made from the point where the scrotum joins the perineum along the middle of the latter to the anterior edge of the anus, round each side of this, and from the posterior edge of it to the ti^) of the coccyx. This incision is to be supplemented by lateral ones carried from the anterior end of the first outwards on to the thigh and then backwards to a little beyond the level of the posterior margin of the anus, so as to include in its area the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium. The flaps are to be dissected back mth great care, the integixment alone being remo^'ed so as to expose the subcutaneous sphincter and the superficial fascia. After the fascia has been carefully dissected off and the perineal vessels and nerves turned aside, the muscles are l;)rought into view. Perineal Fascia.â€”The fasciae of the perineum are the supei-ficial and the deep. The superficial fascia consists, as in other situations, of two layers, one lying next tlie skin and containing an abundance of fat, the other more condensed lying in contact with the muscles. The superficial layer, or fatty layer, in the perineum is con- tinuous with the dartos of the scrotum, or areolar tissue of the labia majora, in front, with the superficial fascia of the thighs at each side, and with the suijerficial fascia covering the glutei maximi and with the coccyx behind. It differs in character and composition in different parts of the perineum ; thus at the back part it consists of fine granular fat which fills up the large space between the ischium and anu.s called the ischio-redal fossa ; over the tuberosity of the ischium it becomes tough and stringy, and is formed by interwoven strands of fibrous tissue betAveen which numerous small synovial bursse are found ; in the anterior part of the perineum, again, it is thin and membranous, the fat being replaced hy unstriped muscular tissue, and is continued into the tunica dartos. The deep or membranous layer of the superficial fascia, or fascia of Colles, lies in close contact with the muscles and super- ficial vessels of the perineum, packing them into their places. On each side it is attached to the ramus of the ischium and pubes, and this attachment is continued forwards and outwards on to the fascia lata of the thigh, where it Ijecomes continuous with the deep fascia ot the gi'om. It is prolonged backwards as far as the transversalis perinei muscle, round the posterior border of which it turns to be united to the deep perineal fascia on which the muscle rests.

It is continued forwards to blend with the deep fascia ot the penis. In the middle line it has on its deep aspect a septal prolongation, complete behind but incomplete in front, so that air or lluid injected beneath the fascia would fill up one side of the pouch which It foi-ms, then passing forwards to where the septum is incomplete, would infiltrate tlie other side. The attachment of the membranous layer to the deep perineal fascia explains why an ex- travasation of fluid under that membrane could not pass back into Fig. 213.â€”The pubic arch and perineal fascise.

The deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia divided by a A-shaped incision into tliree flaps ; the hiteral flaps are turned over tlie ramus of the pubes and ischium at each side, to which tliey are firmly attached ; the posterior flap is continuous with the deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament. 2.

Muscular Triangle.â€”The space between Colles' fascia and the triangidar ligament is occupied by the bulb of the urethra, corpus spongiosum, crura penis, bulbo-cavernosi, ischio-cavernosi and traiis- versus perinei muscles, antei'ior and posterior superficial perineal nerves, superficial perineal and transverse perineal vessels, and a few lymphatic vessels. The deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament of the urethra is a strong ajjoneurotic sheet which is stretched across the inter-pnbic arch. It is attached firmly to the sub-pubic ligament, and to theTRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. Fig. 214.â€”Diagrammatic view of the anterior layer of the triangular ligament and the structures passing through it.

At the posterior border of the transver.salis perinei muscle, it has attached to it the deep layer of the superficial fascia, and with it. is prolonged back on tlie levator ani muscle, as the anal fascia. At an inch and a half from the symphysis pubis, in the middle line, it is connected to the central tendinous point of the perineum. About an inch below the symphysis pubis it is pierced for the passage of the membranous jjortion of the urethra, which is contained between it and the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia behind. Immediately below the sub-pubic ligament the dorsal vein of the penis passes back through it to join the jirostatic plexus, and on each side, a little in front of this, the pudic arteries jDass through it to enter the corpora cavernosa penis. Between this liga- ment and the pelvic fascia are situated the compressor urethraj muscle, the internal pudic arteries, the arteries of the corjjus cavernosum, dorsiim of the penis and bidb, Cowper's glands, the membranous part of the urethra, the dorsal vein of the penis, the dor- sal nerve, lymphatic vessels, and a plexus of veins. Sometimes the triangular ligament is described as consisting of two layers, anterior and jjosterior, the former being the deep perineal fascia, and the latter the layer of j)elvic fascia passing across the pelvic arch. When the ligament is thus described, the structures above enumerated are said to be placed between the two layers of the triangular ligament. The BULBO-CAVERNOSI {acceleratores urince) arise from a tendin- ous point in the centre of the perineum, and from the fibrous rapW of the two muscles. From tliis origin the fibres diverge like the barbs of a j)en ; the posterior to be inserted into the triangular liga- ment ; the middle, to encircle the corpus spongiosum and meet on its upper side ; the anterior, to spread out on the corpus cavernosum at each side, and be inserted partly into its fibrous structure, and partly into the fascia on the dorsum of the penis. The posterior and middle insertions of these muscles are best seen by carefully raising one muscle from the corpus spongiosum and tracing its fibres. The ISCHIO-CAVERNOSUS (erector penis) arises from the tuberositv of the ischium and from the ramus of the pubes behind the extremity of the crus, and curves around the root of the penis ; to be inserted into the upper surface of the corpus cavernosum, where it is con- tinuous with a strong fascia which covers the dorsum of the organ, the fascia jjenis.

Dissection.â€”To dissect the compressor urethrce, the three preced- ing muscles should be removed, so as to render the glistening surface of the triangular ligament apparent. This ligament should then he carefully dissected aA\'ay, and the corpus siDongiosum penis di-\-ided through its middle, separated from the corpus cavernosum, and drawn forwards in order to put on the stretch the membranous ]ior- tion of the urethra, with which the compressor muscles are con- nected. Tlie compressor uretlirse is, however, better seen in a dissection made from within the pelvis, after having turned doAVii the bladdei' from its attachment to the os jiubis, and removed a plexus of veins together with the pelvic fascia. The COMPRESSOR URETHR.ffi (constrictor urethrpe menibra- nacese), directed transversely across the perineum above the tri- angular ligament, arises from the i-amus of the pubes and ischium, their ])oint of union, and fi'om the anterior ligament of the bladderex.

Proceeding inwards it divides into tAvo fan sliaped fasciculi, superior and inferior, wlucli embrace the mem branous portion of tlie urethra, and are continuous with the muscle of the opposite side. The superior fasciculus is continued forwards to the junction of the crura penis, and backwards to the prostate ^land ; on the upper surface oi which it is siiread out. The in- ferior fasciculus is attached to the bulb of the urethra in front, and extends to the prostate gland be- hind. The lowest fibres of this fasciculus are sometimes described as a separate muscle under the name of dcef transversus perinei muscle. A third fasciculus, closely united with the two preceding, con- sists of circular fibres, which en- close and form a muscular sheath for the membranous part of the urethra, and are continuous pos- teriorly with the circular muscular fibres of the prostate gland. Under the name of Wilsonh muscle, a fourth fasciculus has been described as descending vertically from the body of the pubes, near the symphysis, to unite Avith the superior fasciculus of the compressor uretlirse. Nerve-supply.â€”The perineal branch of the pudic. The SPHINCTER ANI is a thin and elliptical plane of luuscle closely adherent to the integument, and surrounding the opening of the anus. It arises posteriorly in the superficial fascia around the coccyx, and by a fibrous raphe (called the ano-coccygeal ligament) from the apex of that bone ; it passes round the margin of the anus, and is inserted anteriorly into the tendinous centre of the perineum, and into the raphe of the integument, nearly as far forAvard as the commencement of the scrotum. The anterior fibres mingle Avith those of the bulbo-cavernosus, the outer ones pass into the levator ani, Avhile some of the innermost fibres cross the median line and decussate Avitli those of the opposite side.

It forms the meeting-point of a numbei- of the perineal muscles ; these are the bulbo-cavernosus, transversus perinei, external sphincter ani, and levator ani muscles of the two sides. Dissection.â€”Part of the levator ani may be seen during the dis- section of the anal portion of the perineum hy removing the fat from the ischio-rectal fossa. But to study the entire muscle, a lateral section of the pehds must be made by sawing through the pubes a little to one side of the symphysis, separating the l)ones behind at the sacro-iliac symphysis, and turning down the bladder and rectum. The sj)ine of the ischium should be cut off with the bone forcej)S or saw, so as to leave it in connection Avith the leA'ator ani and pelvic fascia. The pelvic fascia is then to l^e carefully raised, beginning at the base of the bladder, and jn'oceeding up- wards, until the whole extent of the muscle is exposed. The LEVATOR ANI is a thin plane of muscular fibres, situated at eacli side of the pelvis. The muscle arises from the inner surface of the OS pubis near the puliic arch, from the base and upper border of the spine of the ischium, and between those points, from a ten- dinous arch which occupies the line of division of the pelvic fascia into parietal and Adsceral layers, and is called the white line. It> fibres descend to be inserted into its fellow of the opposite side be- neath the prostate gland, into the rectum, and behind the rectum into its fellow of the opposite side and the side of the extremity of the coccyx. Its anterior filires are sometimes described separately, iinder the name of levator â– prostati. In the female this muscle has an additional insertion into the vagina.

The COCCYGEUS is identical with the same muscle in the male. Nerve-supply.- These muscles are supplied by the same nerves as the corresponding muscles of the male perineum. Actions.â€”The bulbo-cavemosi being continuous at the middle line, and attached at each side to the triangular ligament by means of their posterior fibres, support the Inilbons portion of the iirethra, and acting forcibly, propel the semen, or the last drops of urine from the canaL The posterior and middle fibres contribute to the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compressing the veins leaving the bulb ; and the anterior fibres assist in the erection of the entiie organ by compressing the vena dorsalis, by means of their insertion into the fascia jjenis. The ischio-cavernoms spreads out on the dorsum of the organ into a membranous expansion (fascia penis), which compresses the dorsal vein during the action of the muscle, and especially after the erection of the organ has couimenced. Erection of the penis results from the retention of the blood in the venons spaces of the corpora cavernosi and corpus sjiongiosum, that retention being broiight about by the compression of the veins of those bodies by the bulbo-cavernosus and ischio-cavernosus muscles. The transverse mnscles serve to steady the tendinous centre, that the muscles attached to it may obtain a firm point of support. The compressor urethrce, taking its fixed point from the ramus of the ischium at each side, can compress the urethra so as to close it completely, after the manner of a sphincter. The external sphincter, being a cutaneous muscle, contracts the integiiment around the anus, and by its attachment to the tendinous centre of the perineum and point of the coccyx, assists the levator ani in giving support to the opening during expulsive efforts. The contraction of this muscle is usually involuntary, Imt may be made more forcible at will. The internal sphincter contracts the extremity of the cylinder of the intestine. The use of the levator ani is expressed in its name ; it is the antagonist of the diaphragm and abdominal expulsory muscles, and serves to support the rectum and vagina during their expulsive eft'orts. Yielding to the propulsive action of the abdominal muscles, it enables the outlet of the pelvis to bear a greater force than a resisting structure, and, on the remission of such action, restores the perineum to its original form. Along with the coccygeus it inverts the anal border of the rectum after its ])i-otrusion in defalcation. The coccygei muscles restore the coccyx to its natural position, after it has been pressed l)ackwards dui-uig deftecation or parturition.PELVIC FASCIA. 3" PELVIC FASCIA.

The pelvic fascia is, for convenience of description, divided into a parietal and a visceral layer. The parietal layer of pelvic fascia is connected with the back part of the pectineal line, being there coiitinuons with the iliac fascia; it then passes obliquely downwards and forwards, along the upper edge of the obturator internus muscle to the ujiper margin of the obturator foramen ; it here leaves the bone, and passing over the upper edge of the obturator muscle joins the obturator membrane, thus converting the groove on the under surface of the pubic bone into a canal for the obturator vessels and nerve.

Where the internal pudic vessels and nerve pass inside the tuberosity of ischium, this fascia forms a canal for them in conjunction with the falciform edge of the great_ sciatic lioament; this'is called Alcock's canal. Across the pubic arch the parietal layer is continued to form the so-called posterior layer of the triangular ligament; this portion is attached above to the sub-pubic ligauieut, on each side to the ramus of the pubes, and below is continuous with the triangular ligament (anterior layer).

The visceral layer of the pelvic fascia is derived from the inner surface of the parietal layer along a line drawn from the inner surface of the body of the pubes to the spine of the ischium.

The veins of the bladder form a large and important plexus (vesical plexus) at the side of the base of that organ, between the lateral ligaments and recto-vesical fascia ; this plexus is continuous with a similar plexus on the prostate (prostatic plexus), placed he- tween the pubo-prostatic ligaments and the capsule of the gland. MUSCLES AND FASCIJ5 OF THE UPPEE EXTEEMITY. The superficial fascia of the upj)er extremity contains between its layers the superficial veins and lymphatics, and superficial nerves. The deep fascia is thin over the deltoid and pectoralis major muscle, but thick on the dorsum of the scapula, where it binds do'wn the infra-spinatus muscle. It is attached to the clavicle, coracoid process, acromion process, and .spine of the scapula, and jfornis separate sheaths for all the muscles of the scapula and rishoulder. In the lip^Jer arm it is somewhat stronger, receives fibres ifrom the lower border of the tendons of the pectoralis major and latis- isimus dorsi, as also from the costo-coracoid membrane and deltoid, ;md forms an anterior and posterior sheath for the muscles lying ' in front of and behind the humerus: It is attached to the condylai' ; ridges, by means of the internal and external intermuscular septum, and is inserted inferiorly into the two condyles, the ole- I ranon, and posterior border of the ulna, being continuous between tln'se points with the fascia of the forearm. Besides forming x'liarate sheaths for the muscles, the anterior portion of the 'â€¢lachial fascia gives a sheath likewise to the brachial vessels and median nerve. The intermuscular septa serve to separate the muscles on the li.ii'k ivoin those on the front of the upper arm, and also give an increased area for the attachment of those muscles. The external septum is pierced from l^ehind forwards by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery ; the internal is pierced from lore Ijackwards by the whmv nerve and inferior profunda and â–  'iiastoniotica arteries. I Axillary Fascia.â€”A strong layer of deep fascia stretches across the base of the axillary space, it is continuous in front with the tfuscia which encloses the pectoralis muscle, and slopes downwards and backwards to join the fascia covering the latissimus dorsi ; on I Its uppei' surface it is joined by a layer descending from the pec-3i6 ANNULAR LIGAMENTS. the hollow of the arm-pit. Near the chest wall it i.s pierced b numerous lymjjhatic vessels, and on the outer side it is coutinuoim' with the sheath of the axillary vessels and with the deep fascia o| the arm. The deep fascia of the forearm is strong, and at tlui bend of th elbow is augmented in thickness by a broad band, which i.s given o from the innei- side of the tendon of the biceps (hicipit(tl fanria). It- is iirmly attached to the oleci'anon process, to the ulna, and to th prominent points about the wrist, forms sheaths for the niusci and vessels, gives origin to some of the fibres of the muscles, and i.. jjierced a little above the wrist by the tendon of the iialmaris longus,. At the wrist the transverse fibres form the anterior and posterio annular ligament. The anterior annular ligament is a narrow band of tiljres attached externally to the scaphoid, and internally to the pisiform bone and tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; it is continuous aljove with the deep fascia of the forearm, and below with the palmar fascia. It is connected with the tendons of the palmaris longus and Hexor carpi ulnaris, and gives origin to certain of the muscles of tlie thumb and little finger. The ulnar vessels and nerve, and the cutaneous branches of the median nerve, lie superficially to it. The ligament is pierced by the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, an" forms with the carpal bones a canal which is lined l)y synovial mem- brane, and gives passage to the tendons going to the fingers. The synovial sheath is di^'ided into a large and a small compartment, tiie former transmitting the flexor sublimis and profundus tendons and the median nerve, the latter enclosing the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The posterior annular ligament is an oblique band about half an inch in breadth, extending from the lower end and styloid process of the radius to the cuneiform and pisiform bone at the border of the carpus. It is continuoas above with the fascia of the forearm, below with the thin fascia of the dorsum of the hand, and sends processes inwards to be attached to the bones and form sheaths for the extensor tendons. There are six of these sheaths, the first on the radial side gi^'ing passage to the extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis ; the second, to the extensor carj)i radialis longior and brevior ; the third, to the extensor secundi internodii ; the fourth, to the extensor indicis and extensor com- munis digitorum ; the fifth, whicli is placed between the two bones, to the extensor minimi digiti; and the sixth, situated on the ulna, to the extensor carpi ulnaris. The tendons in passing through these sheaths are each ])rovided with a .synovial bur.sa. On the back of the hand there are two fascitis, superficial and deep. The- su2}erficiaI dorsal fascia is thin and covers in the extensoi' tendons ; it is attached laterally to the metacarpal bones of the index and little finger, and is continuous above with the posterior annular ligament. The deep^ dorsal fascia is stretched across the metacarpal spaces and covers in the interossei muscles.ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 317 The palmar fascia is divided into three portions. A central portion, whicli occupies tlie middle of the palm, and two lateral l)ortions, which are thin and enclose the muscles of the borders of the hand, being continuous with the dorsal fascia. The central portion i.s strong and tendinous : it is narrow at the wiist, where it is attached to the annular ligament and receives the insertion of the tendon of the palmaris longus, and broad over the heads of the metacarj)al bones, where it divides into four jirocesses, each of which subdivides to embrace the I'oot of the corresponding finger. These processes are attached at the middle line to the sheath of the tendons, and at the side of each tingei- to the lateral and transverse ligament. The fascia is strengthened at this point of division by strong fasciculi of transverse fibres ; the arched interval caused by the bifurcation of each slip gives passage to the tendons of the flexor muscles, while the greater arches between the fingers transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and lumbricalis muscles. The palmar fascia is intimately adherent to the skin of the palm by numerous fine fibrous bands, and- gives attachment by its inner margin to the palmaris l)reA'is muscle. Beneath the skin of the fingers some tendinous liands are found, which are jirobably the representatives of the deeji fascia. They have been described by Cleland under the name of phalangeo- cutaneous ligaments, and pass from the sides of the liase of the first i^halanx of each finger to the skill on the back of the second, and from the sides of the l)ase of the second phalanx to the deep surface of the skin forming the pulp of the finger. Anterior Thoracic Region. Dissection.â€”Make an incision along the line of the clavicle, from the ujjper part of the sternum to the acromion process, and thence down the arm as far as the level of the lower border of the latis- sinius dorsi; a second carried transversely outwards from the base of the ensiform cartilage to the posterior border of the axilla ; and connect the two by a third, carried longitudinally along the middle of the sternum. The integument and superficial fascia are to be dissected separately from ott" the fibres of the muscle, and always in the direction of their course. For this purpose the dissector, if he have the right arm, will commence with the lower angle of the Hap; if the left, with the upper angle. He will thus expose the pectoralis major muscle in its whole extent. Pectoral is major, Pectoralis minor, Subclavius. The PECTORALIS MAJOR arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, fi-om half the sternum its whole length, from the cartilages of all t^ie true ribs, excepting tlie first and last, and from the apo- neurosis of the external obli.^ue muscle of the abdomen. From this extensive origin the fibr-es convei'ge to lie inserted bv a broad and folded tendon into the external bicipital ridge of the'humerus.f jiiS PECTORALIS MAJOR. The pectoralis major admits of division into three portions, clavi- ctdar, sternal, and costal; the two former are 6ei)arated from eacli other by a well-marked areolar interspace ; the latter is distin- guished not only by its origin, hut also l)y forming a fold beneatli the sternal portion, and lying behind it at its insertion. At the latter 2)oint the three portions are superimposed, the clavicular being in front, the sternal next, the costal behind ; the clavicular portion being prolonged at its insertion to the lower extremity of tlie bicii^ital ridge, the costal portion to its upper end. The clavicular portion, which arises highest up, is inserted lowest down, and the costal portion which arises lowest is inserted highest on the liumerus. Relations.â€”By its external surface with the fibres of origin of the platysma myoides, mammary gland, superficial fascia, and in- tegument. By its internal surface, on the thorax, with the clavicle, sternum, costal cartilages, intercostal nuiscles, sul)clavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus magnus ; in the axilla, with the axillary vessels and glands. B}^ its external border with the deltoid, from which it is separated above by an areolar interspace lodging the cephalic \-eiii and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its loii-er harder forms the anterior boundary of the axillary space. Nerve-supply.â€”External and internal anterior thoracic Ijranclies of the brachial jjlexus. Dissection.â€”The pectoralis major is to be removed l)v dividing its fibres along the lower Ijorder of the clavicle, and then carrying the incision perpendicularly downwards, j^arallel to the sternum, and at about three inches from its Ijorder. DiWde some loose areolar tissue, and several small branches of the thoracic arteries, and reflect the muscle outwards. We thus bring into view a region of con- siderable interest, in the middle of which is situated the pectoralis minor. The PECTORALIS MINOR arises by three digitations from tlit- front, upper border and outer surface of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs near their cartilages, and from the intercostal fascia ; and is inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior border and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula. It is closely united at its insertion with the coraco-brachialis. Relations.â€”By its anterior surface with the pectoralis major and superior thoracic" vessels and nerves. By its posterior s?Â«/flce with the ribs, intercostal muscles, serratus magnus, axillary space, and axillary vessels and nerves. Its xipper border forms the lower boun- dary of a triangular space, bounded above by the costo-coracoid membrane, and internally by the ril)s ; in this space are found the axillary vessels and nerves. Nerve-supply.â€”Internal antei-ior thoracic from the inner cord ot the l)rachial ]i]exus. Costo-coracoid Membrane.â€”In oider to see the next muscle it is necessary to I'emove a strong sheet of fascia which covers it in; this is called the costo-coracoid membrane. It is a process of deep cervical fascia which, passing beneath the clavicle, encloses the sub-SERRATITS MAGNUS. clavius, and is stretched across from the cartilage of the first rib to the coracoid process. It becomes thinner as it passes doAvnwards, and may be traced to the upper edge of the pectoralis minor ; it encloses that muscle, and from its lower border is continued down- wards to join the axillary fascia and the fascia covering the short head of the biceps. Between the subclavius and pectoralis minor it covers in the first jmrt of the axillary artery, and is pierced by the cephalic vein, acromial thoracic artery and vein, superior thoracic artery and anterior thoracic nerves. The SUBCLAVIUS arises by a round tendon from the cartilage and adjacent osseous part of the first rib ; it is inserted into the under surface of the clavicle near the coraco-clavicular ligament. It lies in a groove on the inferior aspect of the clavicle. Relations.â€”By its upper surface with the clavicle. By the lotver with the subclavian artery and vein and brachial j)lexus, which separate it from the first rib. In front with the pectoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane being interposed. Nerve-supply.â€”A branch from the fifth and sixth cervical. Actions.â€”The pectoralis major draws the arm across the thorax, while its upper fibres assist the upper part of the trapezius in raising the shoulder, as in supporting weights. The lower fibres dej^ress the shoulder with the aid of the latissimus dorsi. Taking its fixed point from the shoulder, the pectoralis major assists the pectoralis minor, subclavius, and serratus magnus in drawing up ancl expand- ing the chest. The pectoralis minor, in addition to this action, draws the coracoid process downwards and forwards, and rotates the scapula on the chest wall in such a manner as to direct the glenoid cavitv downwards. The subclavius draws the clavicle downwards and forwards, and thereby assists in steadying the shoulder. All the muscles of this group are agents in forced inspiration, but are in- capable of acting in that capacity until the shoulders are fixed. Lateral Thoracic Region. Serratus Magnus. The SERRATUS MAGNUS (serratus, indented like the edge of a saw), In-oad, thin, and trapezoid in shape, arises by nine fleshy serra- tions from the eight upper ribs (two of the serrations being attaclied to the second rib), and extends backwards upon the side of the chest to be_ inserted into the whole length of the base of the scapula its anterior aspect. In structure, the muscle is composed of three por- tions : superior, formed l)y the first and second serrations and inserted into the inner sui'face of the superior angle of the scaiuila ; middle. composed of the third and fourth serrations and inserted into the gi-eater part of the posterior border ; inferior, consisting of the last hve serrations : these latter interdigitate with the oblinuus externus ancl torm a thick muscular fasciculus, which is320 SUBSCAPULARIS.

By its deep surface with the rilw and intercostal muscles, to M'liich it is connected hy loose areolar tissue. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior thoracic nerve, from tlie fifth and sixth cervical. Actions.â€”The serratns magnus is the great muscle of forced inspii'atiun, raising the ribs when the shoulders are fixed, and tlierel>y increasing the cavity of the chest. By drawing the scapula for- M'avdn it allows of the further outstretching of the arm after it has Ijeen raised, as in the action called extension in fencing. Along with the trapezius it rotates the scapula so as to i^roject its inferior angle, and thus assists in raising the arm above the level of the shoulder. It is also of service in all movements of pushing. Anterior Scapular Region. Subscapularis. The SUBSCAPULARIS arises from the whole of the ventral sui-face of tlie scapula excepting the sujjerior and inferior angle and pos- terior border, and terminates by a broad and thick tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and by muscular fibres into the surface of bone immediately below that process. In structure the subscapularis is composed of eight or ten fasciculi, four or five of which arise from one side of as many aponeurotic processes attaclied to the ridges of the venter of the scapula ; and four or five proceed from the other side of the aponeurotic processes and from the surface of bone intervening between them. Its tendon forms part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint, glides over a large bursa which separates it from the base of the coracoid process, and is lined l)y a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the articulation. Relations.â€”By its anterior surface with the serratus magnus, coraco-brachialis, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the scapula and shoulder-joint. Nerve - supply.â€”The short and middle subscapular nerves, branches from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. Action.â€”It rotates the head of the humerus in^-ards, and is a ]jowerful defence to the joint. "When the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. Posterior Scapular Region. Supra-spinatus, Teres minor, Infra-sjiinatus, Teres major. The SUPRA-SPINATUS muscle (supra, al)ove ; sjnna, the .spine) arises from the sujn'a-spinous fossa, sjiine of the scapula, and pro]ier im esliuf fascia ; and is inserted into the ui)permost depression onINFRA-SPINATUS AND TERES MUSCLES. 321 tlie greater tuberosity of tlie huinerus, the tendon being united near its attachment witli that of tlie infra-spinatus. The tendon cannot he seen until the acromion process is removed. Relations.â€”By its ui:i'per surface with the trapezius, clavicle, acromion, and coraco-acromial ligament. From the trapezius it is separated hj a strong fascia. By its loiver surface with the supra- .spinous fossa, supra-scapular vessels and nerve, origin of the omo- hyoid muscle, and upper j^art of the shoulder-joint. Nerve-supply.â€”The supra-scapular nerve, a branch from the fifth and sixth cervical. The INFRA-SPINATUS {infra, beneath; spina, the spine) is covered in by a layer of tendinous fascia, which must be removed before the fibres of the muscle can be seen, the deltoid muscle having been previously turned down from its scapular origin. It arises from the vfhole of the infra-spinous fossa, excej)ting the in- ferior angle, axillaiy border, and a small portion near the neck of the bone : from the spine of the scapula, and from the investing fascia; it is inserted into the middle depression of the greater tuberosity of the humerus, its tendon being blended with that of the supra-spinatus above and the teres minor below. Relations.â€”By its posterior surface with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and integument. By its anterior surface with the infra-spinous fossa, supra-scapular and dorsal scapular vessels, and shoulder-joint. By its tipper border it is in relation with the spine of the scapula, and by the loioer with the teres major and minor, being closely united with the latter. Nerve-supply.â€”The supra-scapular nerve. The TERES MINOR {teres, round) arises from the posterior surface of the axillary border of the scapula for about the middle third of its extent ; it is connected with the lower border of the preceding muscle, and is inserted into the inferior depression of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The tendons of the three preceding muscles are in immediate contact with the shoulder-joint. Relations.â€”By its posterior surface with the deltoid and integu- ment.

This branch is distinguished by a ganglionic enlargement, just before it enters the muscle. The TERES MAJOR nmscle arises from the dorsal surface of the inferior angle of the scapula, and from its axillary border ; it is mserted into tlie internal l)icipital ridge of the humerus, immediately liehind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. At its origin this muscle IS covered liy the latissimus dorsi, but the latter shortly afterwards curves around its lower border and becomes placed in front; the two tendons at their insertion, one lying behind the other, are separated by a bursa.TRIANGULAR AND QUADRANGULAR SPACES. 322 Relations.â€”By its posterior surface witli the ]atiÂ«siiiiU8 doi'.-si, scapular head of the triceps, and integument.

Nerve-supply.â€”Middle and long sul)scapular Tranches derived from the posterior cord of the l)rachial plexus. Triangular and Quadrangular Spaces.â€”A large triangulai' space exists between tlie two teres muscles, which is divided into two minor spaces by the long head of the triceps. The smaller of the two spaces is placed posteriorly ; it is ti'iangular in form, being bounded above by the teres minor, below by the teres major, and Fin. 223.â€”Scapular muscles, vessels, and nerves, i.

The anterior space is quadi-angular, and is bounded above by the teres minor, below by the teres major, in front by the humerus, and behind by the long head of the tricej)S ; it transmits the posterior circumflex vessels and circumflex nerve. Actions.â€”The supra-spinatus raises the arm from the side ; but feebly, from the disadvantageous direction of its force. The infra-323 DELTOID. pinatus and teres minor are rotators of the head of the humerus lutwards. The most important use of these three muscles is the trotection of the joint, and defence against displacement of the lead of the humerus, in which action they co-operate with the sul> capularis. The teres major combines "with the latissimus dorsi in otating the arm inwards, and at tlie saine time carrying it towards he side, and somewhat backwards. Acromial Region. Deltoid. The DELTOID (A, delta ; el8os, like) is the large triangular muscle ivhich forms the convexity of the shoulder ; it arises from the outer ihird of the clavicle, from the acromion process, and from the Avhole ength of the lower border of the spine of the scapula. Tlie filjres Tom this broad origin converge to the middle of the outer side of the liumei'us, where they are inserted into a rough triangular elevation, [n structure the deltoid is composed of seven fasciculi, four of which are fleshy above and tendinous below ; and three tendinous above stnd fleshy below. To bring the muscles beneath it into view, the deltoid must be cut away from its origin, and turned down ; in so doing, a large bursa will be seen betweezi its under sui-face and the [lead of the humerus. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the deep fascia, a few .ibres of the platysma myoides, the superficial fascia, and integu- ment.

Its posterior harder is thin and h ndinous above, where it is connected with the aponeurotic cover- ing of the infra-spinatus muscle, and thick below. Nerve-supply.â€”The circumflex nerve, from the posterior cord uf the l)rachial plexus. Actions.â€”The deltoid is the elevator muscle of the arm in a direct line, and, l)y means of its extensive origin, it can carry the arm forwards or backwards so as to range with the hand a con- siderable segment of a large circle. The arm, raised by the deltoid, IS an illustration of a lever of the third power, so common in the animal machine, by which velocity is gained at the expense of power. In this lever, the weight (hand) is at one extremity, the fulcrum (glenoid cavity) at the opposite end, the power (insertion of the muscle) between tlie two, but nearer to the fulcrum than to the weight. When the scapula is fixed the deltoid can only raiseANTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. 324 the arm to a level with the shoulder, all elevation above; tliat levi-I depending upon its rotation, the glenoid cavity heing in this way directed upwards and outwards (see page 200).

The BICEPS BRACHII {bisâ€”caput, two heads ; flexor cubiti) arises by two tendons ; one, the short head, from the coracoid process in common with the coraco-brachialis ; the other, the long head, from the upper part of the glenoid cavit)^, where it is continuous witli the glenoid ligament. The muscle is inserted by a flattened tendon into the back part of the tubercle of the radius. The long head, a long slender tendon, passes through the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint enclosed in a sheath of the synovial membrane ; after leaving the cavity of the joint, it is lodged in the deep groove that separates the two tuberosities of the humerus, the bicipital groove, j A small synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion and the tubercle of tlie radius. At the bend of the elbow, the tendon of tlie biceps gives off fi'om its inner side a tendinous band, whicli spreads out to form a sheet of fascia called the semilunar or bicipital fascia; it i)rotects the l^rachial artery, and is continuous with the fascia of the forearm. The biceps occasionally has a third head, connected with the humerus ; this most frequently arises from the shaft of that bone in connection with the insertion of the coraco-brachialis and origin of the brachialis anticus, and is inserted into the back part of the bicipital fascia and inferior tendon of the muscle. Relations.â€”By its anterior surface with the deltoid, pectoralis major, superficial and deep fascia, and integument. By its posterior surface the short head rests on the subscapularis, from which it is separated by a bursa. In the rest of its extent the muscle is in relation with the humerus, teres major, latissimus doi'si, and bra- chialis anticus ; from the latter it is separated by the musculo- cutaneous nerve. By its inner border with the coraco-brachialis,. lirachial artery and veins, and median nerve ; the brachial vessels crossing its tendon at the bend of the elbow. By its outer border with the deltoid and supinator longus. Nerve-supply.â€”The external or muscular cutaneous nerve. The BRACHIALIS ANTICUS is a broad muscle covering the whole of the anterior surface of the lower part of the humerus ; it arises by two fleshy serrations, which embrace the insertion of the deltoid, from the anterior surface of the humerus, and from the inner inter- muscular septum. Its fibres converge to be inserted into the base of the coronoid process of the ulna, between two processes of the flexor profundus digitorum. Relations.â€”By its anterior surface with the biceps, musculo- cutaneous nerve, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve. By Its posterior surface with the humerus, anterior ligament of the elbow-joint, and intermuscular septum. The latter separates it from the triceps. By its external border with the supinator longus, extensor carpi radiahs longior, musculo-spiral nerve, and recurrent radial artery. By Its internal border with the intermusciilai' se])tum (which separates It from the triceps and ulnar nerve), and with the pronator radii teres.326 POSTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. Nerve - supply. â€” The nuiscvilo-cutaneous and nuisculo-spiral nei've.s. Actions.â€”The coraco-brachialis draws the humerus inwards, and assists in flexing it upon the scapula. The biceps is one of the chief tlexors of the elbow-joint; it is also an important supinator, this action resulting from the attachment of the tendon to the back ])art of the tubercle of the radius. It makes tense the fascia of the forearm, and so assists the muscles connected with the fascia. Its long tendon passing through the shouldei - joint acts as a ligament, keejiing the head of the humerus in its place, and the same tendon, where it lies in the bicipital groove, linuts the outward rotation of the humerus in supination, l)y pressing against the lesser tuljc- rosity. Lastly, the biceps acts as an extensor of the arm at the shoulder, assisting the deltoid. The brachialis anticus is a powerful flexor of the elbow, and in some measure supplies the place of an anterior ligament to that joint. Posterior Humeral Region. Triceps brachii. Dissection. â€” Remove the integu- ment and fascia from the posterior^ aspect of the upper arm. The TRICEPS BRACHII (havhig three heads ; triceps extensor cubiti) arises by three heads : external, middle, and internal.

Tlie three heads, passing downwards in different directions, unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted into the olecranon process of the ulna, and sends an expansion to the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa is situated between the tendon of the muscle and the upper part of the olecranon. Beneath the lower part of the triceps are two small fasciculi arising from the humerus, and descending one on either side of the fossa of the olecranon to be inserted into the capsule of the elbow-joint. These have been named sub-anconeus; they are analogous to the sub-crureus. Relations.â€”By its posterior surface with the deep and superficial fascia and integument. By its anterior surface with the superior profunda artery, muscido-spiral nerve, humerus, intermuscular septa which separate it from the brachialis anticus, and elbow-joint. The scapidar head is in relation posteriorly with the deltoid and teres minor ; anteriorly with the subscapularis, teres major, and latissi- mus dorsi ; and externally with the posterior circumflex vessels and nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”The musculo-spiral nerve. Actions.â€”The triceps brachii is an extensor of the forearm. When the arm has been raised at the shoulder, the long head assists the teres major and latissimus dorsi, in drawing it down again to the side of the chest. Anterior Brachial Region. Superficial Layer. Pronator radii teres. Flexor carpi radialis, Palmaris longus. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Dissection.â€”These muscles are brought into view by making an incision through the integument along the middle line of the fore- arm, crossing each extremity by a transverse incision, and turning aside the flaps. The superficial and deep fascia are then to be removed. The PRONATOR RADII TERES arises by two heads : one from the anterior aspect of the inner condyle of the humerus, fascia of the forearm, and intermuscular se])ttim ; the other from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna ; the median nerve passing between them. Its tendon is flat, and is inserted into the middle of the outer side of the shaft of the I'adius.

The median nerve and ulnar artery pass between its heads. It divides into four tendons, which pass beneath the annular ligament, and are inserted into the sides of the second phalanges of the fingers about their middle, splitting at their termination to give passage to the tendons of tlie deep flexor ; hence its designation, perforahis. The tendons pass beneath the annular ligament ai'ranged in pairs, those for tlie middle and ring fingers being placed superficially, and those for the index and little fingers beneath them. At the liases of the first pha- langes the flexor tendons enter small canals whicli are in part formed Ijy the grooved surfaces of the bones, and in part by fibrous arches thrown across the tendons ; these are called thecce (di^Ka, a case).

By its posterior surface with the radius, interosseous mem- brane, pronator quadratus, and wrist-joint. By its ulnar border it is separated from the flexor profundus digitorum by the anterior interosseous artery and nerve. In the hand : after passing beneath the annular ligament, it is lodged in the interspace between the two l)ortions of the flexor Ijrevis pollicis, and afterwards in the tendinous tlieca of the phalanx. Synovial Sheaths.â€”Beneath the anterior annular ligament two synovial sheaths are found; the larger of these surrounds the tendons of flexor sublimis and flexor profundus digitorum, and332 ACTIONS OF FLEXOR MUSCLES OF FOREARM. extends from a little above tlie annulai- ligament to about the middle of the palm. Tlie .smaller sheath surrounds the flexoi- longus pollicis, and extends from above the annulai- ligament to the base of the second phalanx of the thumb. Between the two sheaths the median nerve lies, or it may occupy the larger sheath along with the flexor tendons. Each of the iingers lias a digital synovial sheath commencing above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and terminating at the base of the last phalanx ; the digital sheath of the little finger generally communicates with the common sheatli Ijeneath the annular ligament. The commonest variations in tlie synovial sheaths are shown in Fig. 229. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior interosseous, a branch of the median. Dissection.â€”If the tendons of the last two muscles be drawn aside or divided, the third muscle of this group will be brought iuto A'iew, lying across the lower part of the two Ijoues.

Actions.â€”The pronator radii teres and pronator quadratus rotate the radius upon the ulna, and render the hand prone. The remain- ing muscles are flexors : two flexors of the wrist, flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris ; two of the fingers, flexor sublimis and profundus, the former flexing the second phalanges, the latter the last; one flexor of the last phalanx of the thumb, flexor longus pollicis. The palmaris longus is primarily a tensor of the palmar fascia, and secondly a flexor of the wrist and forearm. The muscles which arise from the internal condyle of the humerus act as flexors of the elbow-joiut, those which pass to the radial side of the hand and arm being more effective in this respect than the muscles on the ulnar side. The flexor carpi ulnaris is an effective pronator in the early part of its action, and when the hand is j^laced in the position of supination. The superficial and deep flexors of the fingers assist in producing flexion of the wrist, after the flexion of the fingers is completed, or when the fingers are fixed by being pressed against an opposing surface.

Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior interosseous, a branch of the musculo- spiral. The EXTENSOR COMMUNIS DIGITORUM arises from the exter- nal condyle by the common tendon, from the intermuscular septa, and deep fascia ; and divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers. At the meta- carpo-phalangeal articulation each tendon becomes narrow and thick, and sends a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint. It then spreads out, and receiving the tendon of the lumbricalis and some tendinous fasciculi from the interossei, forms a broad aponeu- rosis, which covers the whole posterior aspect of the finger. At the first phalangeal joint the aponeurosis divides into three slips. The middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral portions are continued onwards at each side of the joint, to be inserted into the last. Little oblique tendinous slips connect the tendon of the ring with those of the middle and little finger as they cross the back of the hand.

Passing down to the inferior extremity of the ulna, it traverses a distinct fibrous sheath, and at the metacarpo-335 EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS. jihalcangeal articulation unites with the tendon derived from the ( ommon extensor. The common tendon then spreads out into a 1 >road expansion which divides into three slips to be inserted as in the other fingers into the last two phalanges. It is to this muscle t hat the little finger owes its power of separate extension ; and, being called into action when the point of the fiiiger is introduced into t he meatus of the ear, for the purpose of removing impleasant sen- sations or producing titillation, the muscle was called by the old writers " auricularis." Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior interosseous. The EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS arises from the external con- dyle by the common tendon, from the posterior border of the ulna 1 ly an aponeurosis common to the flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor pro- fundus digitorum, and this muscle, and from the deep fascia. Its tendon passes tlirough the posterior groove in the lower extremity of the ulna, to be inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger.

Relations.â€”By its external surface, the same as the extensor ossis metacarpi. By its deejo surface with the ulna, interosseous mem- brane, radius, wrist-joint, radial artery, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The muscle is placed between the extensor primi internodii and extensor indicis. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior interosseous. The EXTENSOR INDICIS (indicator) arises from the ulna, below the origin of the extensor secundi internodii, and from the inter- osseous membrane. Its tendon passes beneath the posterior annular ligament in the same groove on the back of the radius as the ex- tensor communis digitorum, to be inserted into the aponeurosis of the common extensor tendon of the index finger. Relations.â€”The same as the preceding muscle, with the excep- tion of the hand, where the tendon rests on the metacarpal bone of the forefinger and second interosseous muscle, and has no relation with the radial artery. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior interosseous. The tendons of the extensors, as of the flexor muscles of the fore- arm, are provided with synovial bui'ste as they pass beneath the annular ligament; those of the back of the wrist have separate sheaths, formed by the posterior annular ligament. Actions.â€”The anconeus is associated in its action -with the triceps extensor cubiti ; it assists in extending the forearm on the arm. The supinator longus is a weak supinator, being effective only in the early part of that action ; it is a powerful flexor, but acts only after the flexion has been begun by other muscles. The supinator brevis is the chief supinator, and the direct antagonist of the two pronators. The extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and extensor carpi ulnaris extend the wrist in opposition to the two flexors of the carpus ; they also abduct the hand. The extensor communis digitorum restores the fingers to the straight position after they have been flexed by the two flexors, sublimis and profundus. The extensor ossis metacarpi, primi internodii, and secundi inter- nodii pollicis are the special extensors of the thumb, and serve to balance the actions of tlie flexor ossis metacarj^i, flexor brevis, and flexor longus pollicis. The extensor indicis produces extension of the index finger, and is therefore named " indicator," and the ex- .yMUSCLES OF THE HAND. 338 tensor minimi digiti supplies that finger with the power of exerting a distinct extension.

They pass to the radial side of each finger and are inserted into the aponeurotic ex- pansion of the extensor tendons on the dorsal aspect of the first phalanx. The third, or that of the tendon of the ring finger, sometimes bifurcates ; at other times it is inserted wholly into the extensor tendon of the middle finger. Relations.â€”In the palm of the hand with the flexor tendons ; at their insertion, with the tendons of the interossei and the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. Nerve-supply.â€”Tlie two outer l)y the median, the two inner by the ulnar nerve. The PALMAR INTEROSSEI, three in niunber, are visible only on the palmar as- pect of the hand ; they are placed ujDonthe metacarpal l)ones, rather than between them. They arise froui the base of the meta- carpal l)one of one finger, and are in- serted into the base of the first phalanx and aponeurotic ex- pansion of the ex- tensor tendon of the same finger. The first belongs to the index finger ; the second, to the ring finger ; the third, to the little finger ; the middle finger being omitted.

They are inserted into the base of the first phalanges, and into the aponeurosis of the extensor tendons. The first is inserted into the index finger, and from its use is called abductor indicis; the second and third are inserted into the middle finger, compensating its exclusion from the palmar group ; the fourth is attached to the ring finger ; so that each finger is pro- vided with two interossei, with the exception of the little finger, as may be shown by means of a table, thus :â€” Index finger, | '^V^^ (abductor indicis), ' (one palmar.

By their palmar surface with the muscles and tendons in the palm of the hand. By one side with the metacarpal l^one; by the other with the corresponding palmar interosseous. The abductor indici.'; is in relation by its palmar surface with the adductor pollicis and flexor brevis pollicis. The radial artery passes into the palm of the liand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (abductor indicis) ; and the perforating branches of the deep ijalmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Nerve-supply.â€”All the inteimseous muscles are sui)plied by the ulnar nerve. Actions.â€”The actions of the muscles of the hand are exj^ressed in their names. Those of the radial region belong to the thumb, and provide for three of its. movements, abduction, adduction, and flexion. The ulnai' grou^i, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger. The lumbi'icales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexoi's ; they were called by the earlier anatomists fidiciniiâ€”i.e., fiddlers' muscles, from an idea that they might eft'ect the rapid movements hj which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. The seven in- terossei and the four lumbricales have a double action on the fingers in consequence of being inserted partly into the bases of the first phalanges and partly into the expansion of the extensor tendon. They thus become flexors of the fingers at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and extensors of the two last phalanges ; the foi-mer action being due to their osseous, and the latter to their tendinous insertion. The interossei are, however, chiefly concerned in flexion of the first phalanx, since the greater part of their insertion is into that bone ; the lumbricales, again, almost entirely jmss to the extensor tendon, and they thus combine the action of the flexors with that of the ex- tensors, so as to give fineness and firmness of digital action (Clark).FASCIyE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 343 In relation to tlie axis of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are abductors, the three palmar adductors. It will therefore be seen that each finger is provided with its proper adductor and abductor, two flexors, and (with the exception of the middle and ring finger) two extensors. The thumb has, moreover, a flexor (opponens) and extensor of the metacarpal bone ; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone (opponens) without an extensor. The palmaris brevis draws together the skin on the ulnar margin of the hand, and so increases the hypothenar eminence and deepens the hollow of the hand. MUSCLES AND FASCIAE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. FASCI/E OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia of the thigh consists of two layers, the superficial or fatty, and the deep or membranous. The first is continuous â– with that of the abdomen, and contains more or less fat, according to the subject. Between the two layers are contained the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, and superficial external j)udic branches of the femoral artery and vein ; also the femoral and inguinal lymphatic glands and the vessels connected with them, the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the internal, middle, and external cutaneous nerves. The deep or membranous layer is thin but strong, and is attached to the fascia lata a short distance below Poupart's ligament. It is also closely connected to the fascia lata around the margin of the saphenous opening, which it closes, and here it is more dense than elsewhere, and being pierced by openings for the superficial vessels before alluded to, it is called the cribriform fascia, which forms one of the ( coverings of femoral hernia. It becomes incorporated with the I fascia lata as it descends, and at about six inches below the groin (becomes inseparably united with it. The deep fascia of the thigh is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata ; it is thick and strong upon the outer side of the limb, ; and thinner on its inner and posterior aspect. That portion of the i deep fascia which invests the gluteus maximus is very thin, but that y which covers in the gluteus medius is excessively thick, and gives origin, by its inner surface, to the superficial fibres of that muscle. Tl^e fascia lata is attached superiorly to Poupart's ligament, the crest of the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, tuberosity of the ischium, ramus of the |) ischium and pubes, hody of the pubes, and pectineal line ; it has also ! a deep attachment (ligamentum iliacum) to the anterior border of I the ilium, tendon of origin of the rectus muscle, and border of the acetabulum. It forms sheaths for the muscles of the thigh and I femoral vessels, and is connected with the linea aspera hj means of two intermuscular septa, external and internal; the former exteudnig from the insertion of the gluteus maximus to the external344 FASCIA LATA. condyle, and separating tlie vastus externus from the biceps muscle ; the internal being attached to the inner branch of the linea aspera for a short distance above the internal condyle, and separating tin; vastus internns from the adductor niagnus. The fascia lata receives the attaclinient of two muscles, tensor vagina) femoris and gluteus maximus, and glides over the trochanter major on a bursa. At the lower part of the thigh, the fascia forms a very distinct band of al)Out an inch and a half in width, ilio-tibial band, which receives tendinous fil)res from the extensor and flexor muscles of the thigh, and is inserted into the outer tuberosity of the tibia and head of tlie fibula. At the back of the knee the fascia bridges over the ])Opliteal space, the longitudinal fibres being strengthened by numei'ous trans- verse fasciculi. In addition to the smaller openings in the fascia lata which transmit the small cutaneous vessels and nerves, there exists at the upper and inner ex- tremity of the thigh an oval opening, which gives passage to the superficial lymphatic vessels and the large sub- cutaneous vein of the lower extremity, the internal saphe- nous vein, and is thence named the saphenous opening. Thr existence of this opening has given rise to the division ot the upper part of the fascia lata into two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is situated upon the iliac side of the open- ing. It is attached to the crest of the ilium, and along Pou- part's ligament to the spine of the pubes, whence it is re- flected downwards and out- wards in an arched direction, and forms a falciform border (falciform process of Burns), which constitutes the outer boundary of the saphenous opening.' The edge of this border immediately overlies, and is adherent to, the sheath of the femoral vessels, and the lower extremity of the curve is continuous with the pubic portion. The pubic portion, occupying the pubic side of the saphenous opening, is attached to the spine of the pubes and pectineal line ; Fio. 235.â€”Crural sbeath laid open. a. Middle cutaneous nerve, c.

The interval between the falciform border of the iliac portion and the opposite surface of the pubic portion is closed by an areolo- fibrous layer, derived from the deep layer of the superficial fascia, and pierced by numerous openings for the passage of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels, the cribriform fascia. The cribriform fascia lies superficial to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and forms one of the coverings of femoral hernia. When the iliac portion of the fascia lata is removed from its attachment to Poupart's ligament Fig. 236.â€”Section of the struc- tures which pass beneath the crural arch. 1.

Femoral artery; the two vessels and the ring are sur- rounded by the femoral sheath, and thin septa are sent between the anterior and posterior wall of the sheath, dividing the artery from the vein, and the vein from the crural canal. and turned aside, the sheath of the femoral vessels (the femoral or crural canal) is brought into view ; and if Poupart's ligament be carefully divided, the sheath may be isolated, and its continua- tion with the transversalis and iliac fascia demonstrated. In this view, the sheath of the femoral vessels is an infundibuliform con- tinuation of the abdominal fasciae, closely adherent to the vessels a little way down the thigh, but much larger than the vessels it contains at Poupart's ligament. If the sheath be opened, the artery and vein will be found lying side by side, and occupying the outer two-thirds of the sheath, leaving an inf undilDuliform interval between the vein and inner wall of the sheath ; this portion of the sheath is distinguished under a different title and called crural sheath. The superior opening of the space is named the femoral or crural ring; it is bounded in front by Poupart's ligament, behind by346 FEMORAL HERNIA. the OS jnibis, internally by Gimberuat's ligament, and externally by the femoral vein. The' interval itself serves for the passage of ; the superficial lymphatic vessels from the saphenous opening to a lymphatic gland, which generally occupies the femoral ring, and from thence they proceed into the current of the deep lymphatics. The crural ring is closed merely by a thin layer of sub-serous areolar tissue, which retains the lympliatic gland in its position, and is â–  named septum crurale, and by the ])eritoneum. It follows from this description that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the parietes of the abdomen, particularly in the female, in whom the I femoral arch, or space included between Poupart's ligament and the border of the pelvis, is larger than in the male, while the struc- tures which pass through it are smaller. It happens, consequentlj-, that if violent or continued pressure be made upon the alxlominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced through the femoral ring into the infundibuliform space in the sheath of the femoral vessels, carrying before it the peritoneum and septum crurale,â€”this constitutes femoral hernia. If the causes which gave rise to the formation of the hernia continue, the intestine, unable to extend further down the sheath, from the close connection of the latter with the vessels, will, in the next place, be forced forwards through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, carrying before it two additional coverings, the sheath of the vessels or fascia propria, and the cribri- form fascia; and then, curving upwards over Poupart's ligament, the hernia will become placed beneath the superficial fascia and integument. The direction which femoral hernia takes in its descent is at first dowmoards, then forivards, and then upxoards; and in endeavouring to reduce it, the application of the taxis must have reference to this course, and be directed in precisely the reverse order. The coverings of femoral hernia are theâ€” Integument, Superficial fascia. Cribriform fascia, Femoral sheath, Septum crurale. Peritoneal sac. The deep fascia of the leg is attached to the inner and outer tuberosity of the tibia and head of the fibula, and receives an accession of filires from the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and biceps. Be- tween its points of attachment, and especially behind, it is continuous with the fascia of the thigh. In the front of the leg it encloses the tibialis anticus and extensor muscles, and aftbrds origin to some of their fibres. On the outer side it forms a sheath for the peronei muscles ; and behind, two sheaths, superficial and deep ; the former for the gastrocnemius and soleus with the tendo-Achillis, the latter for the deep flexor muscles. At the ankle these four sheaths arc 1^fascitE of the leg. 347 differently arranged ; tlie posterior superficial slieath terminates on the OS calcis with the tendo-Achillis ; the posterior deep sheath is attached at one side to the border of the internal malleolus, at the other to the os calcis and inner side of the foot, being blended with the origin of the abductor pollicis. This portion of the deep fascia is the internal annular ligament; it sends processes inwards to separate the tendons of the ilexors and forms sheaths for their passage into the foot. The sheath of the peronei muscles at the outer ankle is attached to the external malleolus on one side, and the border of the OS calcis on the other, and forms the external annular liga- ment. The anterior portion of the fascia forms at the ankle the anterior annular ligament; it is divisible into two parts, the upper being transversely disposed, the lower arranged in the form of the letter placed on its side. The latter is often described as a >i']iarate ligament under the name of cruciform ligament; it is com- ]M>sed of two bands about half-an-inch in width, blended with each 'olher at their point of union on the front of the joint. The internal liand is attached above to the internal malleolus and below to the I >s calcis at the outer side of the foot; the external band to the 1 xternal malleolus above, and the scaphoid and internal cuneiform ! hone at the inner border of the foot. The internal band at its origin consists of two layers, between which passes the tendon of the til)ialis anticiis. The tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertiiis have also a separate loop connected with the cruci- form ligament, the sling ligciment of Eetzius ; this is a narrow band which embraces the tendons in a sling-shaped loop, and passes out- wards and backwards to be attached to the sulcus tali and neighbour- ing part of the calcaneum. The tendons passing through the loops and sheaths around the ankle are each furnished with a synovial ljursa. That portion of the deep fascia of the leg which forms a septum between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg is sometimes called the intermiisciUar fascia ; and in operations on the arteries of that region the deep layer of the deep fascia. There is besides another deep portion of fascia above the preceding, the I popliteal fascia, derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus i muscle and bhiding down the popliteus muscle. By its inferior border this fascia is inserted into tlie soleal ridge of the tibia. I The fascise dorsales pedis are tliree in number, superficial, middle, and deep. The superficial layer of deep fascia of the foot is thin and covers tlie dorsum of the foot, being continuous at the ankle with the cruciform ligament, and attached at either side to the borders of the foot, where it becomes united with the plantar fascia. A second or middle layer of fascia covei's in the anterior part of the extensor b^e^'ls digitorum with its tendons ; and a third or deep layer is found l)eneath the latter, and covering in the interossei muscles. On the interossei muscles the tliree layers are united, and the ex- tensoi- tendons are consequently separated from each other in their course to the toes.GLUTEAL REGION. 348 The Plantar Fascia consists of three portions, middle and tw lateral. The middle portion is thick and dense, and comi^osed of stro aponeurotic fibres, closely interwoven with eacli other. It is a tached posteriorly to the inferior surface of the tuberosities of t" OS calcis, and terminates under the heads of the metatarsal Ijoues i five fasciculi. Each of these fasciculi bifurcates to embrace the base of the corresponding toe, and is attached in the middle to the shwitli of the flexor tendons, and at either side to the head of the metatai-sal bone. The point of division of the fascia into fasciculi is strengthened l)y transverse bands, which preserve the solidity of the fascia at its broadest part. The intervals between the toes give jiassage to the digital arteries and nerves and lumbricales muscles. The lateral portions are thin, and cover the sides of the sole of the foot; they are continuous behind with the internal and external annular ligament; and on the mesial side with the central jiortioii. The inner portion is continuous along the border of the foot with the fascia of the dorsum ; the oider portion is attached to the os calcis and base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forming between these points a thick band, which gives origin to part of the abductor minimi digiti muscle. Besides constituting a sti'ong layer of investment and defence t(j the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the different muscles. A strong septum {interrmiscular septim) is given off from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fascia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and di^^des the muscles into three groups, middle and two lateral; and transverse septa are stretched between these to separate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive part of their origin from the plantar fascia. Dissection.â€”The subject l)eing turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the pubes to support the pelvis, the student coni- niences the dissection of this region by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous process ; or vice versa, if he be on the left side. He then reflects the integument, superficial fascia, and deep fascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus maximus, follow- ing rigidly the course of its fibres ; and having exposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and superficial fascia from off the deep fascia which binds down the gluteus medius, the other portion of the region.

The GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (yXovros, nates) is the thick, fleshy mass â€¢ t' muscle, of a trapezoid shape, which forms the convexity of the nates. In structure it is coarse, being made up of fibres collected into large fasciculi, and thes6 again into distinct muscular masses, separated by deep furrows. It arises from the posterior fourth of ilie crest of the ilium, from the rough triangular surface between the crest and superior curved line, the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and from the great sacro-ischiatic ligament. It passes iililicpiely outwards and downwards, to be inserted into the rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea asj)era, and is continuous by means of its tendon with the fascia lata covering the I inter side of the thigh, and with the ilio-tibial band. Several bursse are situated between this muscle and subjacent parts : one upon the tuberosity of the ischium, one between its tendon and the trochanter major, and one between it and the tendon of the vastus externi;s. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with a thin aponeurotic fascia, which separates it from the superficial fascia and integument, and near its insertion, with the vastus externus.

By its upper bor- der it overlaps the gluteus medius ; and by the loioer border forms the lower margin of tlie nates. The gluteus maximus must be turned down from its ori- gin, in order to bring the next muscles into view. Nerve - supply. â€”Inferior gluteal branch of thelesser ischiatic nerve. The GLUTEUS MEDIUS is placed in front of, rather than beneath, the gluteus maximus ; and is covered in by a process of the deep fascia, which is very thick and dense.

Nerve-supply.â€”Superior gluteal nerve, from the sacral plexus. This muscle should now be removed from its origin and turned down, to expose the next, which is situated beneath it. The GLUTEUS MINIMUS is a radiate muscle arising from the surface of the dorsum ilii, Ijetween the middle and inferior curved lines ; its fibres converge to the anterior border of the trochantei' major, into which it is inserted by means of a rounded tendon. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface Avith the gluteus mediiis and gluteal vessels. By its 'deep surface with the ilium, long tendon of the rectus femoris, and capsule of the hip-joint. A bursa is interposed between its tendon and the trochanter. Nerve-supply.â€”Superior gluteal nerve. The PYRIFORMIS {pyriim, a pear), i.e., pear-shaped, arises from the anterior surface of the sacrum, by three little slips interposed between the anterior sacral foramina, from the first to the fourth, from the adjoining surface of the ilium, and from the greater sacro- ischiatic ligament. It passes out of the pehds through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a rounded tendon intr^ the upper border of the trochanter major, behind the tendon of the obturator internus, with which it is often blended. Relations.â€”By its superficial or external surface with the sacnui; and gluteus maximus. By its deep or pelvic surface with the rectum, sacral plexus of nerves, branches of the internal iliac artery, great sacro-ischiatic notch, and capsule of the hip-joint.

Nerve-supply.â€”A branch from the sacral plexus. The GEMELLUS SUPERIOR (gemellus, double, tvnn) is a small slip of muscle situated immediately below the pyriformis ; it arises from the spine of the ischium, and is inserted into the upper l:)order of the tenclon of the obturator internus, and into the upper border of the trochanter major. The gemellus superior is not unfrequently wanting. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerA'e. By its deep surface with the pelvis and capsule of the hip-joint. Nerve-supply.â€”A branch from the sacral plexus. The OBTURATOR INTERNUS arises from the innei' surface of the anterior wall of the pelvis, being attached to the margin of351 OBTUEATOES AND GEMELLI. bone around the obturator foramen and to tbe obturator membrane. It passes out of the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a flattened tendon into the inner aspect of the upper border of the trochanter major. The lesser sacro-ischiatic notch, over which this muscle plays as through a pulley, is faced with cartilage, and provided with a synovial bursa to facilitate its movements. The tendon is most marked on the side applied to the surface of the notch, and is divided into four or five narrow portions, which have a silky sheen ; it is bordered above and beloAV by the gemelli muscles (hence their names), which are in- serted into the sides of its tendon, and appear to be auxiliaries or superadded portionsâ€”external origins, in fact, of the obturator internus. Relations.â€”By its siq^erficial or 'posterior surface with the in- ternal pudic vessels and nerve, the obturator fascia, which separates it from the levator ani and viscera of the pelvis, the sacro-ischiatic ligaments, gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves.

Nerve-supply.â€”A special branch of the sacral plexus. The GEMELLUS INFERIOR arises from the posterior border of the tuberosity of the ischium, and is inserted into the lower border of the tendon of the obturator internus, and into the upper border of the trochanter major. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the external surface of the pelvis and capsule of the hip-joint. By its upper border with the tendon of the obturator internus. By its loioer border with the tendon of the obturator externus and quadratus femoris. Nerve-supply.â€”A branch from the sacral plexus. In this region only the tendon of the obturator externus can be seen, by pulling apart the gemellus inferior and quadratus femoris ; it is situated deeply between the gemellus inferior and upper border of the quadratus femoris. To expose the muscle fully, it is necessary to dis.sect it on the anterior part of the thigh, after the removal of the pectineus, adductor longus, and adductor brevis. The OBTURATOR EXTERNUS muscle (obturctre, to stop up) arises from the obturator membrane and from the surface of the bone immediately surrounding it anteriorlyâ€”viz., from the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; its tendon passes outwards behind the neck of the femur, to be inserted into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. When the femur is rotated outwards the tendon of this muscle lies in the groove between the acetabulum and tuberosity of the ischium.

Actions.â€”The gluteal muscles are abductors of the thigh, when they take their fixed point from the pelvis. Taking their fixed point from the thigh, they act as extensors of the pelvis on the femur, and thus are the chief muscles by which the erect posture is maintained : they assist also in carrying the leg forward in progres- sion. The anterior fibres of the gluteus medius and minimus assisted in rotating the limb iuAvards. The gluteus maximus, from its fibres passing backwards to the posterior aspect of the bone, rotates the limb outwards ; it is, uioreover, a tensor of the fascia of the thigh, and through the agency of the ilio-tibial band acts as an extensor of the leg on the thigh. The other muscles rotate the limb outwards, everting the knee and foot; hence they are named external rotators. The obturator externus, besides being an external rotator, is also a flexor and adductor of the thigh. Anterior Femoral Region.

Dissection.â€”Make an incision along the line of Poupart's hga- ment, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the spine of the pubes ; and a second, from the inner end of the preced- ing, down the inner side of the thigh, and across the inner condyle of the femur to about two inches below the head of the tibia, where it may be bounded by a transverse incision. Turn back the integu- ment from the whole of this region, and examine the superficial fascia; which is next to be removed in the same manner. After the deep fascia has been well considered, it is likewise to be removed, .by dissecting it oft' in the course of the fibres of the muscles. As it "might not be convenient to the junior student to expose so large a surface at once as ordered in this dissection, the vertical incision353 SARTORIUS. may be crossed by one or two transverse incisions, as may be deemed most proper. The TENSOR VAGIN-S FEMORIS (stretcher of the sheath of the thigh) is a short flat muscle, situated on the outer side of the hip. It arises from the crest of the ilium, near its anterior superior spinous process, and from the notch be- tween the two anterior spinous j)rocesses, and is inserted between two layers of the fascia lata at about one-fourth down the thigh.

The SARTORIUS (tailor's muscle) is a long ribbon-like muscle, arising from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and from the notch immediately below that process ; it crosses obliquely the upper third of the thigh, descends behind tlie inner condyle of the femur, and is inserted^ by an aponeurotic expan- sion into the upper part of the inner side of the tibia, nearly as far forward as the crest. This expansion covers in the in- sertion of the tendons of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus muscles. The inner border of the sartorius muscle is the guide to the operation for tying the femoral artery in the middle of its course, and the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangular space.

SCARPA'S SPACE.â€”This is a triangular space of some surgical importance situated at the upper part of the thigh ; in its upper part femoral hernia takes place, and in its lower part ligature of the femoral artery is usually performed. Its base is formed by Pouparl's ligament, its inner border by the adductor longus, its outer bordor by the sartorius muscle, and its apex is at the point where the lattci' muscle crosses the artery. Its floor is formed by the iliacus, psoas, pectineus, adductor longus, and a small part of the adductor brevis. It contains tlie common femoral, superficial femoral, profunda femo- ris, and circumflex arteries, the superficial and profunda femoiis veins, anterior crural nerve and its branches, external cutaneous nerve and deep lymphatic vessels. A perpendicular line, drawn from the middle of the base to the apex of this triangle, immediately overlies the femoral artery with its sheath. The RECTUS FEMORIS is a fusiform muscle placed in the middle of the anterior aspect of the thigh. It arises by a flattened tendon from the space between tlie inferior curved line of the dorsum of the ilium and the upper margin of the acetabulum, its fibres being intimately blended with the circular fibres of the capsular ligament of the hip, and with the cotyloid ligament; this is usually described as the reflected head. The muscle is also connected by means of a rounded accessory band of condensed areolar tissue with tlie anterior inferior spine of the ilium, and by a falciform ^jrocess tr about an inch of the anterior border of the ilium above the inferi( r spine ; this connection is generally regarded as the direct continua- tion of the muscle, and is described as the straight head. These heads are connected by a deep process of the ilio-tibial band and by areolar and adipose tissue situated between the two layers of that process of fascia. The body of the muscle is spindle-shaped, and is composed of fleshy and tendinous fibres disposed in the following manner : the superior tendon as it descends spreads out into an aponeurosis which covers the anterior surface of the upper third of the muscle, and sends a tendinous band between the fleshy fibres as far as the lower third of the thigh ; the inferior tendon, in like manner, spreads out on the back part of the muscle, so as to form an aponeurosis which covers the lower two-thirds of that aspect Between these two the fleshy fibres pass, being arranged in a penni- form manner, those in the middle of the thigh being connected â€¢ anteriorly with the tendinous band above described as originating from the upper aponeurosis. The lower tendon becomes narrowed a few inches above the patella into a flat band which receives on â€¢ its borders the attachment of some fibres of the vastus externus and internus, and is inserted into the anterior edge of the upper surface of the patella. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the gluteus meduis, psoas and iliacus, sartorius ; and for the lower three-fourths of ite " extent with the fascia lata. By its deep surface with the capsuleVASTUS MUSCLES. 355 : of the hip-joint, external circumflex vessels, crureus, vastus internus and externus. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior crural nerve. The rectus must now be divided through its middle, and the two ends turned aside to bring clearly into view the next muscles. The VASTUS EXTERNUS arises from the upper end of the spiral line of the femur as far inwards as the external cervical tubercle, from the inferior border of the great trochanter (where that j)rocess joins the shaft of the bone), from the line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, from the outer lip of the latter as far down as its bifurcation, and from the external intermuscular septum. At the point of its attachment where it lies against the insertion of the gluteus maximus, it becomes blended with the tendon of that muscle, and where the two muscles glide over each other a bursa is interposed. The greater part of the superficial surface is aponeurotic, this being usually the case with the upper three-fourths, excepting the anterior border ; the fleshy fibres run downwards and slightly forwards, passing from the superficial aponeurosis to one situated on the deep asj)ect of the muscle and derived from the tendon of insertion. The lower fleshy fibres are more oblique than the upper ; they are inserted into a narrow thick tendon which is intimately connected with the crureus and rectus ; from this tendon fibrous expansions are given oft" to blend with similar processes derived from the other extensor muscles, and form a fibrous capsule, which passes over the lateral aspect of the front of the knee-joint and is inserted into the head of the tibia. The tendon of insertion gives off an aponeurosis which lines the deep surface of the muscle for the lower half of its extent; traced downwards the tendon is found to be imerted into the upper half of the outer border of the patella. It is often difficult to define the anterior edge of this muscle, and to distinguish its fibres from those of the crureus, but the line of separation is almost invariably indicated by the course of the ex- ternal circumflex vessels, and the nerve passing to the muscle itself. _ Relations.â€”By its siuperfidal surface witli tlie fascia lata, rectus, biceps, semi-membrauosus, and gluteus maximus. By its deep surface with the crureus and femur. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior crural nerve. The VASTUS INTERNUS ames from the spiral line of the femur, from the internal cervical tubercle to the point where that line joins the linea aspera, and from the inner border of the latter as far as the groove for the femoral artery. As was observed with the vastus externus, the superficial portion of the muscle is chiefly aponeurotic, excepting at the lower third of the thigh, where it becomes fleshy. The fieshy fibres below the groove for the artery spring from the rounded tendon of insertion of the adductor magiius and the fibrous membrane which unites that tendon with the internal sui)racondylar line. The fibres of the vastus internus are connected at their origin with those of the adductor muscles ; they lie upon and clothe the556 EXTENSOR MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. inner surface of the femur, but are not attached to it.' The muscle is inserted by a tendon common to it, the crureus, vastus extermis and rectus, into the front of tlie inner half of the base of the patella, but the lower fibres pass directly to the inner border of that boiK; without joining the tendon, and from this latter portion of tlu; muscle an aponeurosis is prolonged to be inserted immediately below the inner tuberosity of the tibia, some of its fibres joining the internal lateral ligament of the knee. In its upper jmrt the muscle is often blended with the crurens, but their line of separation may be made out by following the course of a small nerve which is derived from the upper branch to the vastus internus, and passes down Ijetween the vastus internus and crureus to be distributed to the subcrureus and upper part of the synovial pouch of the knee.

By its deep surface with the crureus and femur. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior crural nerve. The CRUREUS {cms, the leg) consists of four laminae, placed ond over the other ; separated above, at their origin, by intervals of barfl bone, but fused below. The first of these is placed superficially t the rest, and arises from the spiral line to the outer side of the ii ternal cervical tubercle ; its attachment passes from thence dow the outer surface of the bone to the gluteal ridge, and is continued downwards along the outer lip of the linea aspera and external inter muscular septum. Below the point where the linea aspera divide the fibres cease to arise from bone, but continue to spring from th| external intermuscular septum close to its attachment to the supr condylar line. The second layer lies beneath the first, and is attache lower down on the shaft of the femur, and the third and fourth in like manner lie beneath and below the second. Each layer arises entirely by fleshy fibres in the form of an arched process, which extends from the inner border of the shaft transversely across its front, and then obliquely down its outer surface for a short distance to the linea aspera, where it blends witli the adjacent layers of the crureus, the vastus externus and external intermuscular septum. The lower two-thirds of the anterior surface of the crureus is aponeurotic, the aponeurosis being narrow below, where it Lies in the middle of the limb, and spread out above, Avhere it covers the whole of the anterior and part of the outer surface. The crureus is inserted by means of the common tendon into the upper border of the patella.* Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the external circum- flex vessels, rectus, vastus internus and externus. By its deep sur- face with the femur, sub-crureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. * The above description of the extensor muscles is coudensed from an exhaustive account given by Mr. W. Roger WiUiams, M.R.C.S., in the Journal of Ana.U)m.y aÂ»Â« Physiology, vol. xiii. p. 204.ACTIONS OF THE EXTENSOE MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 357 Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior crural nerve. The four muscles above described are often grouped under one common title as tlie quadriceps extensor cruris; or, the three muscles most intimately connected, the two vasti and the crureus, receive the name of triceps femoralis. SUB-CRUREUS.â€”When the crureus is divided from its insertion, a small muscle is seen upon the lower part of the femur ; it generally consists of two fasciculi, external and internal, which are inserted into the pouch of synovial membrane that extends upwards from the knee-joint, behind the patella ; and is named, from its situation, sub-crureus. It draws up the synovial membrane in the act of extension of the knee-joint. Actions.â€”The tensor vaginae femdris renders the fascia lata tense, and rotates the limb inwards. The sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, and, continuing to act, the thigh upon the jjelvis, at the same time rotating it outwards and carrying the leg across that of the opposite side, into the position in which tailors sit; hence its name. Taking its fixed point from below, it assists the extensor muscles in steadying the leg, for the siipport of the trunk. The other four muscles have been collectively named quadriceps extensor, from their similarity of action. They extend the leg upon the thigh, and obtain a great increase of power by their attachment to the patella, which I acts as a fulcrum. Taking their fixed point from the tibia, they steady the femur upon the leg, and the rectus, being attached to the pelvis, serves to balance the trunk upon the lower extremity. Dissection.â€”These muscles are exposed by the removal of the inner flap of integument recommended in the dissection of the an- terior femoral region. The iliacus and psoas arising from within the abdomen can only be seen in their entire extent after the removal of the viscera from that cavity. \ The ILIACUS INTERNUS is a flat radiated muscle. It arises from ( the fossa of the ilium, ilio-lumbar ligament, base of the sacrum, ^ internal lip of the crest, and anterior border of the bone ; and after - escaping beneath tlie crural arch and joining the tendon of the psoas, is inserted into the trochanter minor of the femur. A few fibres of this muscle are derived from the base of the sacrum, and others from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. The Hiacus internus and psoas magnus are so intimately blended at their insertion that tliey are sometimes described as a single I muscle arising by two heads under the name of ilio-psoas.

This bursa some- times communicates with the synovial membrane of the ilio-femoral articulation. By its irmer border, with the psoas magnus and an- terior crural nerve. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior crural nerve. The iliac fascia is the aponeurotic investment of the psoas and iliacus muscle ; and, like the transversalis fascia, is thick below, and becomes gradually thinner as it ascends. It is attached superiorly, along the edge of the psoas, to the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, to the ligamentum arcuatum internum, and to the bodies of the lumbar vertebraa, leaving arches corres])ond- ing with tlie constincted part of the vertebrte for the transit of the lumbar vessels. Lower down it passes beneath the external iliac vessels, and is attached along the margin of the true pelvis ; ex- ternally it is connected to the crest of the ilium ; and, inferiorly, to the outer two-thirds of PouiDart's ligament, where it is continuous with the transversalis fascia. Passing beneath Poupart's ligament,, it surrounds the psoas and iliacus muscle to its termination, and beneath the inner part of the femoral arch forms the posterior segment of the crural canal and sheath of the femoral vessels. The PSOAS MAGNUS (\//'da, lumbus, a loin), situated by the side of the vertebral column in the loins, is a long fusiform muscle. It arises from the bodies and bases of transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae. It also takes its origin from the intervertebral substance, and from a series of tendinous arches attached to the vertebra3, and intended for the protection of the lumbar vessels and branches of the sympathetic nerve in their passage between the muscle and the bone. From this extensive origin the muscle passes along the margin of the brim of the pelvis, ancl beneath Poupart's ligament, to its insertion. The tendon of the psoas magnus is joined by the iliacus, and inserted into the posterior part of the trochanter minor, a bursa being interposed.

Nerve - supply. â€” This muscle re- ceives one branch from the anterior crural, and another from the obturator. The ADDUCTOR LONGUS (adducere, i to draw to), the most superficial of the three adductors, arises by a round and thick tendon from the front surface of the OS pubis, immediately below the angle of that bone; and, assuming a flattened and expanded form as it descends, is inserted into the middle third of the inner lip of the linea aspera.

The ADDUCTOR BREVIS, placed behind the pectineus and ad- ductor longus, is fleshy, and thicker than the adductor longus ; it arises from the body of the os pubis, and is inserted into the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera, immediately behind the insertion of the pectineus.

It is pierced near its insertion by the middle perforating artery. The adductor brevis may now be divided from its origin and turned outwards, or its inner two-thirds may be cut away entirely, when the adductor magnus muscle will be exposed in its entire extent. The ADDUCTOR MAGNUS is a broad triangular muscle, forming a septum of division between the muscles situated on the anterior and those on the posterior aspect of the thigh. It arises by fleshy fibres froin the ramus of the pubes and ischium and from the ante- rior border of the tuber ischii ; and radiating in its passage out- wards, is inserted into the line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, to the whole length of the middle lip of the linea aspera, and' by a rounded tendon into a small spine on the inner condyle of the femur. The adductor magnus is pierced by five openings ; the three superior, for the three perforating arteries; the fourth, for the termination of the profunda. The fifth is the large oval opening, in the tendinous portion of the muscle, that gives passage to the femoral vessels. Relations.â€”By its anterior surface with the pectineus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, femoral artery and vein, and profunda artery and vein, with their branches.

Actions.â€”The iliacus, psoas, pectineus, and adductor longus muscles Hex the thigh upon the pelvis, and at the same time, from the obliquity of their insertion into the lesser trochanter and linea aspera, rotate the limb outwards ; the pectineus and adductors ad- Iduct the thigh powerfully, and from the manner of their insertion into the linea aspera, assist in rotating the limb outwards. The gracilis is an adductor of the thigh ; but contributes to the flexion of the leg, by its attachment to the tibia. Posterior Femoral E-egion.â€”Ham-string Muscles. Biceps femoris, Semi-tendinosus, Semi-membranosus. Dissection.â€”Kemove the integument and fascia from the posterior part of the thigh by two flaps, and turn aside the gluteus maximus from the upper part; the muscles may then be examined. "The BICEPS FEMORIS (flexor cruris) arises by two heads, one (long head) by a common tendon with the semi-tendinosus from the lower and inner part of the tuber ischii ; the other (short head), muscular and much shorter, from the loAver two-thirds of the external border of the linea aspera, external supracondylar ridge, and external i intermuscidar septum. The short head reaches as high as the in- ! sertion of the gluteus maximus. The biceps forms the outer haui- string, and is inserted by a strong tendon into the' head of the ftbula ; one portion of the tendon being continued downwards into the fascia of the leg, and another being attached to the outer tuberosity (of the tibia. At its insertion into the fibula the tendon divides into two portions, between which the long external lateral ligament of the knee passes, a synovial bursa being interposed. } Relations.â€”By its superficial or posterior surface with the gluteus maximus and fascia lata.

The SEMI-TENDINOSUS, remarkable for its long tendon, arises in ! common with the long head of the biceps, from the lower and inner part of the tuberosity of the ischium : the two muscles being closely united for several inches below their origin. It is inserted into theHAM-STRTNG MUSCLES. 362 origin upper part ol' tlie inner side of tlie tibia, nearly as fai' forwarda as the crest, immediately below the insertion of the tendon of the gra- cilis, and sends an expansion to the fascia of the leg.

These two muscles must be dissected from the tube- rosity of the ischium, to bring into view the of the next. The SEMI - MEMBRANO- SUS, remarkable for the ten- dinous expansion upon its an- terior and posterior surface, arises from the ujjper and outer facet on the tuberosity of the ischium, external to the common origin of the two preceding muscles. It is in- serted into the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia; at its insertion the tendon splits into three portions, one of which is in- serted in a groove on the inner side of the head of the tibia, beneath the inter- nal lateral ligament. The second is continuous Avith an aponeurotic expansion that binds down the popliteus muscle, the pojditeal fascia; and the third turns upwards and outwards to the external condyle of the femur, forming the middle portion of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint (ligamentum posticum Winslowii).

If the senii-membranosus muscle be turned down from its origin, the student will bring into view the broad and radiated expanse of the adductor magnus, against which the three flexor muscles above described rest. Actions.â€”The three ham-string muscles are flexors of the leg upon the thigh ; and taking tlieir flxed point from below they extend the pelvis, and balance it on the lower extremities. The biceps, from the obliquity of its direction, everts tlie leg when partly flexed, and the semi-teiidinosus turns the leg inwards when in the same state of flexion. Cleland has pointed out that tlie ham-string muscles limit flexion at the hip as long as the knee is extended ; so that it is only by flexing the leg on the thigh that it is possible completely to flex the thigh on the abdomen. Anterior Tibial Region. Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitoruin, Peroneus tertius, Extensor proprius hallucis. Dissection.â€”The dissection of the anterior tibial region is to be commenced by carrying an incision along the middle of the leg midAvay between the tibia and fibula, from, the knee to the ankle, and bounding it inferiorly by a transverse incision extending from one malleolus to the other. To expose the tendons on the dorsum of the foot, the longitudinal incision may be carried onwards to the outer side of the base of the great toe, and terminated by another incision directed across the heads of the metatarsal bones. The TIBIALIS ANTICUS arises from the outer tuberosity and upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the tibia, the interosseous membrane, intermuscular fascia, and deep fascia ; its tendon passes tlirough a distinct sheath in the anterior annular ligament close to the inner border of the tibia, and is inserted into the inner and under side of the internal cuneiform bone, and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.

Tlie EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITOEUM (extensor communis longus) arises from the outer tuberosity of the tiljia, the head and upper three-fourths of the fibula, the interosseous membrane, intermuscular fascia, and deep fascia. Near the ankle it divides into four tendons, which pass beneath the annular' ligament through a proper tendinous pulley (the sling ligament of Retzius), to be inserted into the second and third phalanges of the four lesser toes. The mode of insertion of the extensor tendons is remarkable; each ten- don spreads into a broad aponeurosis over the base of tlie first pha- lanx ; this ajioneurosis is strengthened on its borders by the tendons of the extensor brevis digitorum, lumbricales and interossei, and di- vides into three slips ; the middle slip is in- serted into the base of the second jihalanx, the two lateral slips are con- tinued onwards, to be inserted into the base of the third. Relations,â€”By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and anterior annular ligament. By its posterior surface with the interosseous mem- brane, fibula, ankle - joint, extensor brevis digitorum (which sepa- rates its tendons from tl le tarsus),' metatarsus, and phalanges. By its inner surface with the: tibialis anticus, extensor jiropi'ius hallucis, and anterior tibial A^essels. By its outer border with the peroneus longus and brevis. Nerve-supply,â€”This muscle and the next are both supplied by the antei'ior tibial nerve. The PERONEUS TERTIUS arises fiom the loAver fourth of the- inner siirface of the fibula and intermuscular fascia, and is inserted' into the upper surface; of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little â–  toe.

Sometimes it is wanting. . The EXTENSOR PROPRIUS HALLUClS lies between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the middle three-fifths of the fibula and interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular liga- ment, and is inserted into the l)ase of the last jihalanx of the great toe, being closely connected with the first pha- lanx by short fibrous bands.

It is crossed on this aspect by the anterior tibial vessels and nerve.

By its inner side with the tibialis anticus, and anterior tibial vessels. Nerve-supply.â€”Anterior tibial nerve. Actions.â€”The tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius are direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg. The two tibial muscles acting together raise the inner border of the foot and draw it inwards. They assist also in preser-\dng the arch of the foot during progres- sion. The extensor longus digitorum and extensor proj^rius hallucis are extensoi's of the phalanges ; and continuing their action, they assist the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius in flexing the foot upon the leg. Taking their origin from below, they increase the stability of the ankle-joint. Posterior Tibial Region. Superficial Group: Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, Soleus.

The GASTROCNEMIUS (yaa-rpoKv^fMiov, the bellied part of the leg arises by two lieads from the rough surfaces above the back part of the two condyles of the femur, the inner head being the longest. The tendons of origin are intimately connected with the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and are lined on their anterior surface by the synovial membrane. They unite to form the beauti- ful muscle so characteristic of this region of the limb. It is inserted, by means of the tendo- Achillis, into the lower part of the posterior tuberosity of the OS calcis, a sjTiovial bursa being placed between the tendon and the upper part of the tubero- sity. The gastrocnemius must be removed from its origin, and turned down in order to expose the next muscle. Relations. â€” By its super- ficial surface with the deep fascia of the leg, which sepa- rates it from the external saphena vein, and with the external saphenous nerve. By its deep surface with the lateral portions of the posterior liga- ment of the knee-joint, the popliteus, plantaris, and soleus. The internal head of the muscle rests against the pos- terior surface of the internal i condyle of the femur, and is â€¢ separated from the semi-mem- â–  branosus by a synovial bursa 1 which often communicates with : the ca\-ity of the knee-joint. The external head rests against; the outer side of the external i condyle, and often has in it a sesamoid bone or fibro-cartilage. Nerve-supply.â€”Internal popliteal nerve. The PLANTARIS {planta, the sole of the foot), an extremely, diminutive muscle situated between the gastrocnemius and soleus,. arises from the upper and back part of the outer condyle of the. femur; and is inserted, by its long and delicately slender tendon,, into the inner side of the posterioi' tubei-osity of the os calcis, by the side of the tendo-Acliillis, having crossed obliquely between i367 SOLEUS AND POPLITEUS. the two muscles. It corresponds to the palmaris longus in the forearm. Nerve-supply.â€”Internal popliteal nerve. The SOLEUS (solea, a sole) is the broad muscle upon which the plantaris rests. It arises from the head and upper half of the fibula, from the oblique line and middle third of the inner border of. the tibia, and from a tendinous arch thrown across between these two portions. Its fibres converge to the tendo-Achillis, by which it is â–  inserted into the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. The tendinous arch gives passage to the popliteal vessels and nerve in their course to the leg. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the gastrocnemius and plantaris. By its deep surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus hallucis, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and pero- neal vessels. Nerve-supply.â€”Internal jDopliteal. Actions.â€”^The three muscles of the calf draw powerfully on the OS calcis, and lift the heel; continuing their action they raise the entire body. This movement is attained by means of a lever of the second power, the fulcrum (the toes) being at one end, the weight (the body supported on the tibia) in the middle, and the power (these muscles) at the other extremity. They are, therefore, the walking muscles, and perform all move- ments that require the support of the whole body from the ground, as dancing, leaping, &c. Taking their fixed point from below, they steady the leg upon the foot. The gastrocnemius is also a powerful flexor of the leg on the thigh. Deep Layer. Popliteus, Flexor longus digitorum. Flexor longus hallucis, Tibialis posticus. Dissection.â€”After the removal of the soleus, the deep layer will be found bound down by an intermuscular fascia which is to be â€¢ dissected away ; the muscles may then be examined. The POPLITEUS muscle {^oples, the ham of the leg) for ms the floor of the popliteal region at its lower part, and is bound tightly - down by a strong fascia derived from the middle slip of the tendon of the semi-membranosus niuscle. It arises by a rounded tendon from a deep groove at the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, beneath the external lateral ligament and within the capsular ligament of the joint; and spreading obliquely over the head of the tibia, is inserted into the surface of the bone above its oblique line. This line is sometimes called, from l^eing the limit of insertion of the popliteus muscle, the poyliteal line. During flexion of the limb, the tendon of origin of this muscle lies in the groove on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur. It is homologous with the pronator radii teres in the forearm.368 FLEXOR MUSCLES OF THE LEG.

The FLEXOR LONGUS H ALLUCIS is the most superficial of the next three muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the internal surface of the fibula excepting about an inch at its lowest The FLEXOR LONGUS DIGITORUM (flexor perforans) arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, extending from the oblique line to within three inches of the inner ankle. Its tendon passes through a sheath, common to it and the tibialis posticus, behind the inner malleolus ; it then passes through a second sheath which is con- nected with a groove in the astragalus and os calcis into the sole of the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes, perforating the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum.

By its deep surface with the tibia and tibialis posticus. In the sole of the foot its tendon is in relation with the abductor hallucis and flexor brevis digitorum, which lie super- ficially to it, and it crosses the tendon of the flexor longus Rallucis. At the point of crossing it receives a tendinous slij) of communi- cation. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior tibial. Dissection.â€”The flexor longus hallucis must now be removed from its origin, and the flexor longus digitorum drawn aside, to bring into view the entire extent of the tibialis posticus. The TIBIALIS POSTICUS lies upon the interosseous membrane, between the two bones of the leg. It arises by two heads from the adjacent sides of the tibia and fibula their whole length except about two inches at the lower end, from the interosseoiis membrane, and from an a]5oneurosis which binds it in its place. Its tendon passes inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and runs in the same sheath ; it then passes through a proper sheath over the deltoid ligament, and beneath the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid and internal cunei- form boixe, a process of its tendon being prolonged outwards to the external cuneiform, and other processes -being connected with the middle cuneiform, the cuboid, and the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. While in the common sheath behind the internal malleolus, the tendon of the tibialis posticus lies internally to that of the flexor longus digitorum, from which it is separated by a thin fibrous par- tition. A sesamoid bone is usually met with in the tendon close to its insertion. Eelations.â€”By its superficial surface with the intermuscular septum, flexor longus hallucis, flexor longus digitorum, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, peroneal vessels, and in the sole of the foot the abductor hallucis. By its deep surface with the interosseous membrane, fibula and tibia, ankle-joint and astragalus. The anterior til)ial artery passes between the two heads of the muscle. Nerve-supply.â€”Posterior tibial. The student will observe that the two latter muscles change their relative position to each other in their course. Thus, in the leg the position of the three muscles from within outAvards is, flexor 2 A Fig. 245.â€”Relations of parts behind the inner malleolus. 1,1. Tibialis posticus. 2. Tendo-Achillis. 3.

At the inner malleolus, the relation of the tendons is, tiljialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, both in the same sheath ; then a broad groove, which lodges the posterior tibial artery, venaj coniites, and nerve ; and lastly, the Hexor longus hallucis. Actions.â€”The popliteus is a flexor of the tibia upon the thigh, carrying it at the same time inwards so as to invert the leg, the joint being so arranged that rotation is only possible when the leg is flexed. It is especially brought into play at the commencement of flexion of the knee, producing the inward rotation of the tiljia (oi- outward rotation of the femur), which is essential to that action. The flexor longus hallucis and flexor longus digitorum are the long flexors of the toes ; their tendons are connected in the foot by a short tendinous band, hence they necessarily act together. The tibialis posticus is an extensor of the tarsus upon the leg, and in this respect is an antagonist to the tibialis anticus. It combines with the til)ialis anticus in adduction of the foot. Fibular Region. Peroneus longus, Peroneus brevis. Dissection.â€”These muscles are exposed by continuing the dissec- tion of the anterior tibial region outwards beyond the fibula to the border of the posterior tibial region. The PERONEUS LONGUS {-rrepovrj, fibula) arises from the head and upper two-thirds of the outer side of the fibula, from the deep fascia and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a long tendon which passes behind the external malleolus, aud obliquely across the sole of the foot, through the groove in the cuboid bone (converted into a canal by a fibrous band), to be inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe and under surface of the internal cuneiform bone. Its tendon is thickened where it glides behind the external malleolus, and a sesamoid bone is de- velojied in that part which jslays against the cuboid bone. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, peroneus breAds, os calcis, cuboid bone, and, near the head of the fibula, the external popliteal nerve. By its anterior border it is separated from the extensor longus digitorum by the attachment of the fascia of the leg to the fibula ; and, by the posterior border, by the same medium from the soleus and flexor longus hallucis. The tendon of the peroneus longus is furnished with three fibrous sheaths and as many synovial memlji'anes ; the first is situated behind the external malleolus, and is common to this muscle and the peroneus brevis, the second at the outer side of the os calcis, the third on the cuboid bone. Nerve-supply.â€”Mitsculo-cutaneous nerve, a branch of the pero- neal nerve. The PERONEUS BREVIS lies beneath the peroneus longus : itMUSCLES OF FOOT, 371 arises from the lower two-thirds of the external surface of the slaaft of the fibula and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a tendon which passes behind the external malleolus and through a groove in the os calcis, to be inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the peroneus longus and fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, OS calcis, and cuboid bone. The lateral relations of the muscle are the same as those of the peroneus longus. The tendon of the peroneus brevis has but two tendinous sheaths and two synovial membranes, one being behind the external malleolus and common â€¢ to both i^eronei, the other at the side of the os calcis. Nerve-supply.â€”Musciilo-cutaneous nerve. Actions.â€”The peronei muscles are extensors of tlie foot, con- j"ointly with the tibialis posticus. They antagonise the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, which are flexors of the foot; they also raise the outer border of the foot and draw it outwards. The whole of these muscles acting together, tend to maintain the arch of the foot, so necessary to security in walking. FOOT. Dorsal Region. Extensor brevis digitorum. Dorsal interossei. The EXTENSOR BREVIS DIGITORUM muscle arises from the outer side of the OS calcis, the external calcaneo-asti'agaloid ligament, and the lower part of the an- terior annular ligament; it crosses the foot obliquely, and terminates in four tendons, the innermost of which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three into tlie outer side of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes.

The dorsal interossei mnscles all abduct from the niiddle line of the second toe. The tendon of the first is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the second toe, the other tendons into the enter side of the first phalanges of the' second, third, and fonrth toes. Nerve-supply.â€”External plantar nerve. Relations.â€”By their ^q)per surface Avith a strong fascia which separates them from the extensor tendons. By their under surface with the plantar interossei. Each of the muscles gives passage to a small ai'tery (posterior perforating) which communicates with the external plantar artery ; and between the heads of the first inter- osseous muscle the dorsalis pedis artery takes its course. Plantar Region. First Layer. Abductor hallucis. Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis digitorum. Dissection.â€”The sole of the foot is best dissected by carrying an incision around the heel and along the inner and outer border of the foot, to the great and little toe. This incision should di-\ade the integument and superficial fascia, and l^oth together should be dis- sected from the deep fascia, as far forward as the base of the j^ha- langes, where they should be removed from the foot altogether. The j)lantar fascia should then be raised by a transverse incision made through it at about the middle of the foot, and should be turned over towards the toes ; the first layer of muscles will thus be brought into view. The ABDUCTOR HALLUCIS lies along the imier border of the foot; it arises by two heads, l)etween which the tendons of the long flexors, arteries, veins, and nerves enter the sole of the foot. One head j^roceeds from the inner tuberosity of the os calcis, the other from the internal annular ligament and plantar fascia ; it is inserted along with the inner head of the flexor l)revis hallucis into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and into the internal sesamoid bone. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the internal portion of the plantar fascia.

It arises from the outer tuberosity of the os cal- cis, the surface between the two tuberosities, the external intermuscular septum, and from the plantar fascia as far for- ward as the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; and is inserted with the flexor brevis into the hase of the first phalanx of the little toe. Relations. â€” By its superficial surface with the external portion of the plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the flexor accessorius, flexor brevis minimi digiti, tarsal bones, and meta- tarsal bone of the little toe. By its inner side with the flexor brevis digitorum, from which it is separated by the vertical septum of the j)lantar fascia. Nerve-supply.â€”External plantar nerve. The FLEXOR BREVIS DIGITORUM (perforatus) is placed between the two preceding muscles. It arises from the under surface of the OS calcis, from the plantar fascia, and intermuscular septa ; and is inserted by four tendons into the liase of the second phalanx of the four lesser toes. Each tendon divides, previously to its insertion, to give passage to the tendon of the long flexor; hence its cognomen perforatus. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the plantar fascia.

The FLEXOR ACCESSORIUS arises by two slips, the inner of which is fleshy and the outer tendinous ; tlie former is attached to the inner surface of the os calcis, and the latter to the under sui'face of the same bone a little in front of tlie outer tuberosity, and to the long plantar ligament. It is inserted into the outer border, and upper and lower surfaces of the long flexoi' tendon.

Flexor brevis hallucis. Adductor hallucis, Transversus pedis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Dissectionâ€”The tendons of the long flexors and the muscles con- nected with them must be removed, to see clearly the attachments of the third layer. The FLEXOR BREVIS HALLUCIS arises by a pointed tendinous process from the side of the cuboid, external cuneiform bone, and expanded tendon of the tibialis posticus ; it is inserted by two heads into the outer and inner sides of the base of the first phalanx of the gi-eat toe. Two sesamoid bones are developed in the tendons of insertion of these two heads, and the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis lies in the groove between them. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the abductor hallucis, tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the tarsal bones, metatarsal bone of the great toe, and insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. By its inner border with the abductor hallucis ; and by its outer border with the adductor hallucis ; with both of which muscles it is blended near its insertion. Nerve-supply.â€”Internal plantar nerve. The ADDUCTOR HALLUCIS arises from the cuboid bone, the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and the base of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. It is inserted into the Ijase of the first phalanx of the great toe, in conjunction with the outer head of the flexor breads hallucis. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the tendons of the flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, flexor accessorius, and lumbricales. By its deeiJ S7irface with the tarsal bones and ligaments, external jilantar artery and veins, interossei muscles, tendon of the peroneus longus, and metatarsal bone of the great toe. By its inner border with the flexor brevis hallucis, Avith which its fibres are blended. Nerve-supply.â€”Ex ternal plantar. The TRANSVERSUS PEDIS arises by fleshy slips from the inferior metatarso-phalangeal ligaments of the three outer toes, and from the transverse ligament. It passes transversely inwards to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, its tendon being blended with that of the adductor hallucis. Relations.â€”By its superficicd surface with the tendons of the flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, and lumbricales. By its deep surface with the interossei and ligaments of the metatarso- phalangeal articulations. Nerve-supply.â€”External plantar. Tlie FLEXOR BREVIS MINIMI DIGITI arises from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus. It is inserted into the base and external border of the first phalanx of the little toe. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with the tendons of thePLANTAR INTEROSSEI. 376 flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, the fourth lumbricalis, abductor minimi digiti, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the plantar interosseous muscle of the fourth metatarsal space, and the lifth metatarsal bone. Nerve-supply.â€”External plantar. Fourth Layer. Plantar interossei. â€¢ The PLANTAR INTEROSSEI muscles are three in number, and are placed imon rather than between the metatarsal bones. They arise from the base and inner side of the shaft of the metatarsal bone of the three outer toes, and are inserted into the inner side of the extensor tendon and base of the first phalanx of the same toes. The plantar interosseous all draw towards the middle line of the second toe, the dorsal draw from that line ; hence the former are abductors, the latter adductors. A like arrangement exists in the hand, with this difference, that the middle finger is the one through which the central line is drawn. Actions.â€”The muscles of the foot cor- respond generally with those of the hand, and their actions are indicated by their names. It may, however, be noticed that, while the long flexor muscles are flexors of the toes, they are extensors of the foot at the ankle-joint, and in like manner the extensors of the toes are flexors of the ankle. The flexor accessorius is not represented in the hand ; its use is to modify the line of action of the long flexoi', so as to bring it into the dii'ection of the middle of the foot, and of the short flexor muscle. It is probable that the adductor hallucis cor- responds to the inner head of the flexor bre^ds j)oIIicis of the hand, the trans- versus pedis being the true adductor ; and the nerve-supply of these muscles furnishes confirmation of that view.

In the section on Histology two sets of vessels have been described, namely, those carrying blood and those carrying lymph, and the former have further been divided into arteries, veins, and capillaries. The description of the capillaries can, however, only be satisfactorily given in connection with the organs of which they form a part, so that their arrangement and distribution will not now occupy our attention. The present section will therefore be devoted to the description of the arteries, veins, and lymphatics. ARTERIES. In the consideration of the arteries, the aorta will be first de- scribed, with the branches of that trunk and their subdivisions, which together constitute the efferent portion of the systemic circula- tion ; and then the pidmonary artery as the efferent trunk of the pulmonary circulation. AORTA. The aorta arises from the base of the left ventricle, at the middle of the root of the heart on a level with the body of the sixth dorsal vertebra, and presents at its commencement an enlargement caused by three dilatations of the walls of the vessel, the sinuses of Val- salva, and corresponding with the three semilunar valves. It ascends at first forwards and to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into the arch, descending or thoracic, and abdominal aorta. The ARCH OF THE AORTA, commencing at a point corresponding with the articulation of the cartilage of the third rib with the sternum on the left side, crosses behind and near the sternum to a point corresponding with the upper boi'der of the articulation of the second rib witli the sternum on the right side. It then curves backwards and to the left, and descends to the left side of the body378 AORTA. of tlie fifth floT'sal vei-tebra, and at tlie lower border of the latter vertebra becoiuew the thoi-acic aorta. The first or ascending portion of the arch, a little more than two inches in length, is almost wliolly contained within the pericardium ; it extends from the third costal cartilage of the left side, to the upper border of the second cartilage of the right side, at its junc- tion with the sternum. It has in front the pulmonary artery, right auricular appendix, pericardium and thymus gland ; on its left side the pulmonary artery ; on its right the right auricle and superior vena cava; and behind the right pulmonary artery and veins. The second or transverse portion of the arch is directed back- wards and to the left, and extends from the second costal cartilage on the right side to the left side of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra. It has in front, the left i3leura and lung, remains of thymus gland, left phrenic nerve, left superior cardiac nerve, left inferior cardiac of the pneumogastric, left pneumogastric nerve, and left superior intercostal vein. Behind it is in relation with the trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, deep cardiac plexus, and left re- current laryngeal nerve. Above it gives off the arteria innominata, left carotid and left subclavian artery, and h;i3 lying on it the left vena innominata ; and beloiv is in relation with the superficial cardiac plexus, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, cord of the ductus arteriosus, left bronchus, and left recurrent nerve. The third or descending portion of the ai'ch lies against the fifth dorsal vertebra, and is j)artially covered by the left pleura. It is in relation in front with the pleura and root of the left lung, behind with the body of the fifth dorsal vertebra, on the right side with the oesophagus and thoracic duct, and on the left with the pleura. Descending Aorta.â€”The descending aorta is subdivided, in cor- respondence with the two great cavities of the trunk, into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Thoracic Aorta.â€”The thoracic aorta, commencing at the lower border and left side of the fifth dorsal vertebra, curves gentlj'- towards the right as it descends, and as it passes through the aortic opening of the diaphragm lies on the middle line of the vertebral column in front of the last dorsal vertebra. It is in relation behind, with the vertebral column and lesser-vena azygos ; in front, with the CESophagus, left pulmonary artery, left bronchus, pericardium, and right iJneumogastric nerve ; to tlie_ left side, with the pleura, left lung, and oesophagus ; and to the right, with the oesophagus, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. Abdominal Aorta.â€”The aorta enters the abdomen through a special opening in the diaphragm, and, as it lies against the liody of the last dorsal vertebra, receives the name of abdominal aorta: it passes downwards, and on the fourth lumbar vertebra, a little to the left of the middle line, divides into the two common iliac arteries. Its relations and branches will be described on a later page.379 HEAET AND GREAT VESSELS. Fig. 250.â€”Heart and great vessels, i. Anterior belly of digastric. 2. Submental artery. 3.

Supra-renal, Renal, Superior mesenteric, SjDermatic, Inferior mesenteric, Lumbar, Sacra-media, , Common iliacs. Varieties of the Aorta.â€”The aorta seldom deviates from tin; course and relations above described. In some few cases there is persistence of the double arch which exists in the early stages of the development of the vascular system, and in rare instances the aortic arch turns to the right side instead of the left, this being frequently accompanied by complete transj^osition both of the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Varieties in the primary branches of the arcli are by no means uncommon. That which is by far the most frequent is the origin of the left vertebral from the arch ; next in frequency we have the origin of both carotids and the right subclavian in common from the innominate, so that the primary branches of tlie transverse arch are reduced to two. Occasionally there is absenn' of the innominate, all four branches arising directly from the arcli : in such cases the order in which the branches are generally giveii off is, right common carotid, left carotid, left subclavian, right sub- clavian, the last artery passing behind the trachea and cesophagiis to reach its proper position behind the right sterno-claWcular joint. The CORONARY ARTERIES arise from the two anterior of tlie three aortic sinuses at tlie commencement of the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately above the free margin of tlu' semilunar valves. The left coronary (usually the larger of the two) passes forwards, lietween the pulmonary artery and left auricular appendix, and divides into two branches ; one of wliicli (posterior) winds around the base of the left ventricle in the auriculo-ventricular grooA'e, and reaches nearly as far as the corresponding branch of the right coronary ; the other (anterior) passes along the groove of union of the two ventricles, on the anterior aspect of the heart, to its ai)e.\. giving off branches in its course to the ventricular walls. The left381 INNOMINATE ARTERY. coronary artery snpj)lies the left auricle and anterior surface of both ventricles. The right coronary passes forwards, between the root of the pulmonary artery and the right auricle, and runs from left to right in the auriculo-ventricular groove. It gives off a small branch which continues onwards transversely, between the left auricle and ventricle; the main trunk descends along the posterior aspect of the heart to its aj)ex, giving off twigs which supply the posterior aspect of both ventricles. The coronary arteries anastomose with each other on the surface of the heart, and by the branches distributed to the walls of the great ^'essels ; but in the walls of the heart their branches are for the most part " terminal arteries," without anastomoses. INNOMINATE ARTERY. The innominate artery (brachio-cephalic) (Fig. 250, 23) is the first and largest artery given off by the arch of the aorta. It is an inch and a half in length, and arises from the arch behind the junction of the first and second pieces of the sternum ; it ascends obliquely towards the right sterno-clavicular articulation, where it divides into the right carotid and right subclavian artery.

It follows, therefore, that the right carotid is shorter than the left; it is also more anterior ; and, in consequence of proceeding from a branch instead of from the main trunk, is larger than its fellow. The right common carotid artery (Fig. 250, 11) ascends the ' neck perpendicularly by the side of the trachea and larynx, from behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the' ex- ternal carotid and internal carotid. The left common carotid (Fig. 250, 16) passes somewhat oli- liquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the side of the neck, and thence upwards by the side of the trachea and ccsophagus to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides like the right common carotid into the external carotid and internal < carotid. Relations.â€”The common carotid artery, in the neck, is enclosed in a fibrous sheath, which also contains the internal jugular vein, lying to the outer side of the artery, and the vagus nerve, whicli lies between and behind both. The sheath rests on the vertebral column, having interposed the sympathetic nerve and anterioi' muscles of the vertebral column, and being crossed behind by the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Numerous glandular branches are distributed to the lateral lobeLINGUAL ARTERY. 38S of tlie thyroid gland, forming a free anastomosis in its substance Avitli the branches of the inferior thyroid. The LINGUAL ARTERY ascends obliquely from its origin ; it then j^asses forwards parallel with the great cornu of the hyoid bone ; thirdly, it ascends to the under surface of the tongixe ; and foiu'thly, runs forwai'd in a serpentine direction to its tip, under the name of ranine artery^ where it terminates by being distribiited to the muscles and mucous membrane of the tongue. Eelations.â€”The first part of its course rests on the middle con- strictor muscle of the pharynx, being covered in by the tendon of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoid muscle ; the second is situated between the middle constrictor and hyo-glossus muscle, the latter separating it from the hypoglossal nerve ; in the third part of its course it lies between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus ; and in the fourth (ranine), rests on the lingualis to the tip of the tongiie. Branches.â€”Hyoid, Dorsalis lingute. Sublingual, Eanine.

It iis situated between the mylo-liyoid and genio-hyo-glossus, generally accompanies Wharton's duct for a part of its course, and wends a branch to the f ra^num lingiue. The latter branch aftbrds the hemor- rhage which sometimes follows the operation of snipping the fryenum in children. The ranine artery may be looked on as the true continuation of the lingual; it runs forwards beneath the tongue, resting upon the lingualis muscle, having the genio-hyo-glossus to its inner side, and is covered by mucous membrane. It distributes numerous small branches to the substance of the tongue, bvit does not, as is generally stated, anastomose witli its fellow of the opposite side. Hyrtle has proven by experimental injections that there is no communication between the arteries of the two sides, and this fact is substantiated by the exijerience of surgeons, who find that the longitudinal section of the tongue in the middle line is unaccompanied by arterial hemorrhage. FACIAL ARTERY.â€”-The facial artery (maxillaris externa) arises immediately above the lingual and a little above the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and passes forwards to the submaxillary gland, in which it lies embedded. It then curves around the body of the lower jaw, close to the anterior inferior angle of the masseter muscle, ascends to the angle of the mouth, and thence to the angle of the eye, where it is named angular artery. The facial artery is tortuous in its course over the buccinator muscle to accommodate itself to the movements of the jaw. Relations.â€”Below the jaw it passes beneath the digastricus and stylo-hyoid muscles ; on the body of the lower jaw it is covered by the platysma myoides, and at the angle of the mouth by the de- pressor anguli oris and zygomatic muscles. It rests on the sub- maxillary gland, lower jaw, buccinator, orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris proprius, and levator labii supe- rioris alaeque nasi. Its branches may be grouped into those which are given off below the jaw, and those on the face ; they may be thus arranged :â€” Below the Jaw. On the Face. Ascending palatine, Muscular, Tonsillar, Buccal, Submaxillary, Inferior labial, Submental, Inferior coronary, Muscular. Superior coronary, Lateral nasal. Angular. The inferior oi- ascending palatine branch ascends between the ptvlo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, to be distributed to the styloid muscles.

The tonsillar branch ascends by the side of the pharynx, and pierces the superior constrictor muscle to be distributed to the tonsil, and root of the tongue. The submaxillary are four or five branches which supply the submaxillary gland. The submental branch runs forward on the mylo-hyqid muscle, under cover of the body of the lower jaw, distributes branches to the submaxillary gland," and muscles attached to the lower jaw, and anastomoses with branches of the sublingual, inferior labial, and mental arteries. The muscular branches beneath the jaw are distributed to the internal pterygoid, digastric, and stylo-hyoid, and those on the face to the masseter and ljuccinator. The buccal branches, eight or ten in number, are given off upon the face, and are distributed to the buccinator, masseter, muscles of the upper lij), orbicularis palpebrarum, and integument of the cheek. They anastomose with the buccal branch of the internal maxillary, the transA^erse facial, and infraorbital. The inferior labial branch passes forward beneath the depressor anguli oris muscle, and is distributed to the muscles of the lower lip, inosculating with the labial branch of the inferior dental, the inferior coronary, and submental. It is frequently derived from the next branch. The inferior coronary branch is given off at the angle of the mouth, and passes inwards near the edge of the lower lip, lying between the orbicularis and mucous membrane : it inosculates vnth. its fellow of the opposite side. The superior coronary branch, arising close to, or in common vnth, the preceding, takes its course in the same manner along the upper lip, inosculating with its fellow of the o]jposite side. At the middle of the lip it sends a small branch upwards to the septum of the nose (arteria septi). The lateral nasal branch is given off near the ala nasi, and passes beneath the levator labii superioris alajque nasi, to be distributed to the nose. It inosculates with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery, the infraorbital, and its fellow of the opposite side. The angular is the termination of the facial artery ; it inosculates at the inner side of the orbit with the nasal branch of the ophthal- mic artery. The inosculations of the facial artery are numerousâ€”namely, with the sublingual Ijranch of the lingual, ascending pharyngeal artery, descending palatine artery, inferior dental at its escape from the mental foramen, infraorljital at the infraorbital foramen, buccal branches of the internal maxillary on the surface of the buccinator, transverse facial on tlie side of the face, and nasal and frontal branches of the ophthalmic artery at the angle of the eye. The facial artery is subject to variety in length : it not unfre-388 BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, quently tei'ininates at the angle of the nose or mouth, and is rarely symmetrical on both sides of the lace. The OCCIPITAL ARTERY, smaller than the anterior branches, passes backwards behind the jmrotid gland and beneath the j^osterioi- belly of the digastric, traclielo-mastoid, and sterno-mastoid to the occipital groove in the mastoid portion of the tempoi-al bone. It then ascends between the splenius and com])lexus, pierces the tra- pezius, and is distributed to the back of the head, anastomosing with the opposite occipital, posterior auricular, and temporal arteries. The hypoglossal nerve curves around this artery opposite the angle of the jaw and near its origin from the external carotid. The occi- pital artery is sometimes derived from the ascending cervical of the thyroid axis, or from the internal carotid. Branches.â€”It gives off several muscular branches to the sterno- mastoid, digastric, stylo-hyoid, and deep muscles in its course, a small branch to the external ear, and two larger branches, inferior meningeal and princeps cervicis. The inferior meningeal ascends by the side of the internal jugular vein, and passes through the jugular foramen, to be dis- tributed to the dura mater. The arteria princeps cervicis is a large and irregular branch. It descends the neck between the complexus and semi-spinalis colli, and inosculates with the deep cervical of the subclavian and with branches of the vertebral. This branch is the means of estab- lishing an important collateral circulation 1)etween the branches of the carotid and subclavian, after ligature of the common carotid artery. A small mastoid branch enters the skull through the mastoid foramen, and is distributed to the dura mater. The POSTERIOR AURICULAR ARTERY arises from the external carotid, al)ove the level of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and ascends by the side of the styloid process and behind the parotid gland, to the back part of the concha. It is distributed l>y two l)ranches to the external ear (auricular branch), and side of the head (occipital branch), anastomosing with the occipital and temporal artery ; some of its branches pass through fissures in the fibro-cartilage to reach the anterior surface of the pinna. Branches.â€”The posterior auricular gives off a branch to the digastric muscle, and several branches to the parotid gland ; it then gives off the stylo-mastoid, which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen to be distributed to the aqufeductus Fallopii, labyrinth, mastoid cells, and tympanum; a twig accompanies the chorda tympani under the name of tympanica superior. One branch of the stylo-mastoid artery forms with tlie anterior tympanic artery an anastomic circle round the drum of the ear. The ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY, the smallest ol the branches of the external cai'otid, arises from that trunk near its origin (or at the point of bifui'cation of the common carotid), and ascends to the base of the skull. iTEMPORAL ARTERY. 389 Tliis arteiy has behind it, the vertebral cohimn, rectus anticus maior muscle, and superior laryngeal nerve ; m front, the stylo- pharyngeus muscle ; on the inner side, the pharynx ; on the outer side, the internal carotid artery and superior cervical ganglion ot the sympathetic. Its branches are :â€” Pharyngeal, Prevertebral, Meningeal. The pharyngeal branches are distributed to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx, extending upwards to the soft palate, tonsils, and Eustachian tube, and downwards nearly to the commencement of the oesophagus. The prevertebral branch pierces the prevertebral fascia and is distributed to the rectus anticus muscles, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and ninth, tenth, and eleventh pairs of nerves. It anastomoses with the ascending cervical artery. The inferior meningeal branches pass through the jugular fora- men or anterior condylar foramen, and often through the fibrous tissue closing the middle lacerated foramen ; they end in the dura mater. The PAROTIDEAN ARTERIES are four or five large branches which are given off from the external carotid whilst in the parotid gland. They are distributed to the structure of the gland, their terminal branches reaching the integument of the side of the face, and masseter muscle. The TEMPORAL ARTERY is one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid. It ascends over the root of the zygoma ; and at about an inch and a half above the zygomatic arch, divides into an anterior and posterior temporal branch. The anterior temporal is distributed over the front of the temple and arch of the skull, and anastomoses with the opposite anterioi' temporal and with the supraorbital and frontal artery. The posterior temporal curves upwards and backwards, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The trunk of the temporal artery is covered by the parotid gland and attraliens auriculam muscle, and rests on tlie temporal fascia. The branches of the temporal artery areâ€”some small offsets to the parotid gland and articulation of the lower jaw, and the fol- lowing :â€” Anterior auricular. Transverse facial. Middle temporal. The anterior auricular branches, two in number, are distributed to the anterior portion of the pinna. The transverse facial arises from the temporal immediately below the zygoma, and runs transversely across the face, resting on the masseter muscle, and lying parallel with and a little above Stenson's duct. It anastomoses with tlie facial and infraorbital arteries.390 BBANCHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. Tlie middle temporal branch passes through an opening in the temporal fascia immediately aljove the zygoma into tlie suijstance of the temporal muscle, and sends small Ijranches to that muscle, in- osculating with the deep temporal arteries. It gives off a small orbital branch which passes forward immediately aljove tlic zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, and inos- culates beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum, witli the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY, the other terminal Ijrancli of the external carotid, has next to Ije examined. Dissection.â€”The internal maxillary artery passes inwards behind the neck of the lower jaw to the deep structures in the face ; we re- quire, therefore, to remove several parts for the purpose of seeing it conij)letely. To obtain a good view of the vessel, the zygoma should Fig 253.â€”Diagram of the branches of the internal maxiUary artery, i. External carotid. 2. Superficial temporal, s. Internal maxillary. 4.

Turn down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle. In doing this, a small artery and nerve will be seen crossing the sig- moid notch of the loAver jaw to enter the masseter muscle (masseteric). Saw through the ramus of the jaw on a level with the crowns of the molar teeth, and divide the neck of the condyle with cutting forceps, then turn the coronoid process with the insertion of the temporal muscle upwards towards the skull; some vessels Avill be seen enter- ino- the under surface of the muscle ; these are the deep temporal.

The artery and the deep branches of the inferior maxillary nerve will be seen lying against the internalINTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 391 pterygoid muscle. These are to be carefully freed from fat and areolar tissue, and then examined. The internal maxillary artery commences in the substance of the parotid gland, ojijiosite the meatus auditorius externus ; it passes in the first instance horizontally forward behind the neck of the lower jaw ; next, curves around the lower border of the external pterygoid muscle near its insertion, and ascends obliquely foi'wards upon the outer side of that muscle ; it then passes inwards between the two heads of the external pterj^goid, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa. Occasionally it takes its course between the two j)terygoid muscles, without appearing on the outer surface of the external pterygoid. For the purposes of description it admits of division into three portions : maxillary, pterygoid, and spheno-maxillary. Relations.â€”The maxillary portion is situated between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament and inferior dental nerve, and lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve ; the ptery- goid portion between the external ]Dterygoid muscle, and the masseter and temporal muscle, or between the two pterygoid muscles. The s2Jhe7io-maxillary portion lies between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and, in the spheno-maxillary fossa, is in relation with Meckel's ganglion. Branches.â€”Maxillary Portion. Anterior tympanic, Inferior dental. Middle meningeal. Lesser meningeal. Pterygoid Portion. Deep temporal, Pterygoid, Masseteric, Buccal. Sjjheno-maxillary Portion. Superior dental, Spheno-palatine, Infra-orbital, Descending palatine, Pterygo-palatine, Vidian. The anterior tympanic branch passes into the tympanum through the fissure of Glaser, and is distributed to the cavity of the tympanum and membrana tympani; on tlie latter it inoscu- lates with the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery, and with the Vidian artery. It gives off an auricular branch to the lining membrane of the external auditory meatus and outer surface of the drum of the ear. The inferior dental descends to the dental foramen, and enters the canal of the lower jaw in company with the inferior dental nerve. Opposite the bicuspid teeth it divides into two branches, one of which is continued onwards within the bone as far as the symphysis, to supply the incisor teeth ; while the other, mental, escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen, and anastomoses with the inferior labial and submental Ijranches of the facial. It supplies the alveoli and teeth of the lower jaw, sending small branches along the canals m their roots. At the inferior dental foramen, it gives ott a mijlo-hxjmd branch, which accompanies the mylo-hyoid nerve392 BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The middle meningeal is (imbraced at its origin l>y the two root.s of the auriculo-teinporal nerve ; it ascends behind tlie teniporo- niaxillary ai-ticulation to the foramen sjjinosum in the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and entering the cranium, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch crosses tin- great ala of the sphenoid to the groove or canal in the anterioi- inferior angle of the parietal bone, and divides into brandies whicli ramify on the external surface of the dura mater, and anastomose with corresponding branches from the opposite side. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal bone, to the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The liranches of the middle meningeal artery are distributed chiefly to the bones of the skull ; in the middle fossa it sends ;i small petrosal branch through the hiatus Fallopii to the facial nerve, and branches to the Gasserian ganglion. The lesser meningeal is a small branch which ascends to the foramen ovale, and passes into the skull to be distributed to the Gasserian ganglion and dura mater. It gives off a twig to the nasal fossae and soft palate. The lesser meningeal is often derived from the middle, instead of from the internal maxillary directly ;â€”the tympanic also occasion- ally springs from the same trunk. The muscular branches are distributed, as their names imply, to the five muscles of the maxillary region ; the deep temporal branches are two in number, anterior and jDosterior ; they inosculate with the middle and superficial temporal. The pterygoid branches are distributed to the two muscles of that name. The masseteric artery passes outwards, behind the tendon of the temjooral muscle and over the sigmoid notch, to the masseter muscle. The buccal branch, arising opposite the anterior part of the pterygoid muscle, passes downwards with the buccal nerve to the buccinator muscle. It inosculates with the facial and transverse facial arteries. The superior dental or alveolar artery is given oft" from the internal maxillary, just as that vessel is about to make its turn inwards to reach the sj)heno-maxillary fossa. It descends on the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and sends its branches through several small foramina to supply the posterior teeth of the upper jaw, and the antrum. The terminal branches are continued forwards on the alveolar process, to be disti'ibuted to the gums and sockets of the teeth. The infraorbital appears, from its size, to be the proper con- tinuation of the artery. It runs along the infraorbital canal with the superior maxillary nerve, sending branches upwards into the orbit, and downwards, through canals in the bone, to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum and the teeth of the upper jaw, and emerges on the face at the infraorbital foramen. The branch which supplies the incisor teeth is the anterior dental artery; on the face the infraorbital inosculates with the facial and transverse facial arteries.393 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The pterygo-palatine is a small branch which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal, and supplies the mucous mem- brane of the posterior part of the nares, upper part of the pharynx, Eustachian tube, and sphenoidal cells. The spheno-palatine, or posterior nasal, enters the superior meatus of the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen, m com- pany with the nasal filaments of Meckel's ganglion, and divides into two branches ; one branch, arteria septi, is distributed to the mucous membrane of the septum, and inosculates in the anterior palatine canal with the terminal branch of the descending palatine ; the other supplies the mucous membrane of the lateral wall of the nares, antrum, and sphenoid and ethmoid cells. The descending palatine artery descends along the posterior palatine canal, in company with the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion, to the posterior palatine foramen ; it then bends forward, lying in a groove of the bone, and is distributed to the palate. While in the posterior palatine canal it sends several twigs back- wards through the small posterior palatine foramina to supply the soft palate ; anteriorly it gives off a branch, anterior palatine, which reaches the nares through the anterior palatine canal, and inosculates with the arteria se^^ti. The Vidian or pterygoid branch passes backwards along the Dterygoid canal with the nerve of the same name, and is distributed io the sheath of the nerve, the Eustachian tube, and mucous mem- brane of the upper part of the pharynx. INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The internal carotid artery curves slightly outwards from the bifurcation of the common carotid, and ascends nearly perjDendi- cularly by the side of the pharynx, to the carotid foramen in the petrous portion of the teniiDoral bone. It next passes imvards, along the carotid canal, forivards by the side of the sella turcica, and wpioards by the anterior clinoid process, where it pierces the dura mater, and divides into three terminal branches. The course of ;his artery is remarkable for the number of angular curves which it "orms ; one or two of these flexures are sometimes seen in the cer- vical portion, near the base of the skull; and, by the side of the sella turcica, it resembles the italic letter s, jDlaced horizontally. Relations.â€”In consideration of its connections, the artery is divisible into a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral j)ortion.

The PETROUS PORTION is separated from the bony wall of tlie carotid canal by a periosteal lining derived from tlie dnra mater; it is in relation with the carotid plexns, and is covered in l)y the Gasserian ganglion. The CAVERNOUS PORTION is situated in the cavernous sinus, and is in relation by its inner side with the lining membrane of the sinus, and by its outer side with the sixth nerve. The CEREBRAL PORTION of the artery is enclosed in a sheath of the arachnoid, and is in relation with the optic nerve. At its point of division it is situated in the fissure of Sylvius. Branches.â€”The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no brandies : from the other portions are derived the following :â€” From the Petrous portion. From the Cavernous portion. From the Cerebral portion. Tympanic. ( Arteriae receptaculi, \ Ophthalmic. i Anterior cerebral, ) Middle cerebral or Sylvian, S Posterior communicating, I Anterior choroid. The TYMPANIC is a small branch given off in the carotid canal; it enters the tympanum and inosculates with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. The ARTERI.ffi RECEPTACULI anterior and posterior are two small branches given off in the cavernous sinus and distributed to the parts contained in the sinus, to the Gasserian ganglion, and dura mater. The OPHTHALMIC ARTERY arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel pierces the dura mater, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen, lying extei-nally to the optic nerve. It then crosses the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit; and runs along the lower border of the superior oblique muscle, to the imier angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal branches, frontal and nasal. Branches.â€”The branches of the ophthalmic artery, ten in num- ber, may be arranged into two groups : first, those distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts ; and, secondly, tliose which supply the muscles and globe of the eye. They are :â€”OPHTHALMIC AETERY. 395 OrTaital Group, Ocular Group. Lachrymal, Muscular,â€”anterior ciliary, â–  Supraorbital, Ciliary, sliort and long, Posterior ethmoidal, Arteria centralis retinae.

It follows the course of the lachrymal nerve, above the FiCr. 254.â€”Distributiou of the ophthalmic artery, i. Frontal bone. 2. Crista galli. 3. Cribriform plate. 4. Lesser -wing of sphenoid. 5.

The lachrymal artery gives off a malar branch which passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa, and inosculates with the deep temporal arteries, while some of its branches become subcutaneous on the cheek, and anastomose with the transverse facial. The supraorbital artery follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpelira? muscle ; it passes through the supra- orbital foramen, and divides into a superficial aud deep branch, which are distributed to the muscles and integument of the fore-396 OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. liead, and to the pericranium. At the supraorhital foramen it sends a branch inwards to the diploci. The ethmoidal arteries posterior and anterior pass througli the internal orbital foramina, and arc distributed to the falx cereljri and to the ethmoidal cells and nasal fossae. The latter accompanies tlic nasal nerve, and sends a branch to the frontal sinus. The Ijrancht^ distributed to the dura mater are called anterior vieningeal. The palpebral arteries superior and inferior are given off from the ophthalmic, near the inner angle of the orbit; they encircle the eyelids, forming a supeiior and an inferior arch near the borders of the lids, between the orbicularis palpebrarum and tarsal cartilage. At the outer angle of the eyelids, the superior palpeliral inosculates with the^.orbital branch of the temporal artery. The inferior jjal- pebral artery sends a branch to the caruncula lachrymaUs and lachrymal sac. The frontal artery, one of the terminal branches of the ophthal- mic, emerges from the orbit at its inner angle, and ascends along tlic middle of the forehead. It is distributed to the integument, muscle.-, and pericranium, and anastomoses Avith the supraorbital artery. The nasal artery, the other terminal branch of the ophthalmic, passes out of the orbit above the tendo oculi, and diAddes into two branches ; one of which inosculates with the angular artery, while the other, dorsalis nasi, runs along the ridge of the nose, and is dis- tributed to the integument of that organ. The nasal artery sends a small branch to the lachrymal sac. The muscular branches, usually two in number, sujjerior and inferior, supply the muscles of the orbit; and at the anterior part o! the globe of the eye give off the anterior ciliary arteries, which pierce the sclerotic near its margin of connection with the cornea, and are distributed to the iris. The ciliary arteries are divisible into three groups, short, long, and anterior. The short ciliary, from ten to fifteen in number, pierce the sclerotic around the entrance to the optic nerve, and supply the choroid coat and ciliary processes. The long ciliary, two in numbei', pierce the sclerotic at opposite sides of the globe of the eye, and pass forwards between it and the choroid to the iris. They form an arterial circle around the circumference of the iris by inosculat- ing with each other, and from this circle branches are given off which ramify in the substance of the iris, and form a second circle around the pupil. The arteria centralis retinae pierces the optic nerve obliquely, about a quarter of an inch from the globe of the eye, and passes forwards in the centre of its cylinder to the retina, where it divides into branches, which ramify in the inner layer of that membrane. It supplies the retina and hyaloid membrane. In the foetus a small branch of this artery is seen to run through the centre of the vitreous humour to the posterior surface of the lens ; it is, however, com- monly absent in the adult.397 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The ANTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissiu'e between the two hemisjjheres of the brain ; then curves liackwards along the corpus callosum to its posterior extremity. Near its commencement it gives off medullary branches whicli pierce the anterior perforated space to be distributed to the anterior extremity of the caudate nucleus of the corpus striatum ; at its ter- mination it gives off a branch to the corjjus callosum. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected soon after their origin by a short anastomosing trunk, the anterior communicating artery. The MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY, or Sylvian artery, larger than the preceding, j^asses outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes of the brain, and the island of Reil. It gives off medullary branches which j^ass through the substantia perforata to the back part of the caudate nucleus, the lenticular nucleus and neighbouring part of the thalamus opticus. The POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY, variable in size, sometimes douljle, and sometimes altogether wanting, passes back- wards and inosculates with the posterior cerebral, a branch of the basilar artery. Occasionally it is so large as to take the place of the posterior cerebral artery. The ANTERIOR CHOROID is a small branch which is given off from the internal carotid, near the origin of the posterior communi- cating artery, and passes beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain to enter the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is dis- tributed to the choroid plexus, and to the walls of the middle cornu. A more minute descxdption of the arteries of the brain, their communications and distribution, will be given along with the de- scriptive anatomy of that organ in Part VI. of this work. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. . The subclavian artery on the right side arises from the innomi- nate artery, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation ; on the left, from the arch of the aorta. The right is consequently shorter than the left, and situated nearer the anterior wall of the chest; it is also somewhat greater in diameter, from being a branch of a branch, in place of a division from the main trunk. On both sides the artery terminates at the lower border of the first rib, being there continued into the axillary artery. The course of the subclavian artery is divisible, for the sake of precision and surgical observation, into three portions ; the scalenus anticus forming the means of division. The first portion of the right and left arteries differs in its course and relations in correspondence with the dissimilarity of origin above referred to. The other two portions are alike on both sides. The first portion, on the right side, ascends obliquely outwards to Llie inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the Left side it ascendsSUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 398 l-)crj)eiKliculai'ly to tlati inner border of that muscle. The second, portion curves outwards behind tile scalenus anticus ; the third por- tion passes downwards and outwards from the outer edge of the scalenus anticus to the lower border of the first rib, where it be- comes the axillary artery.

Three are given oft' by the first portion of the artery ; one, the superior intercostal, by the second jjortion; ^vhen a fifth artery exists, it arises from the third portion, and is the ] insterior scapular. So frecruent is the occurrence of this variation, tliat many anatomists consider it to be the normal condition. In a taljular form the branches are as follows :â€” Vertebral, Internal mammary, !Inferior thyroid, Suprascapular, or transversalis humeri, Transversalis colli. Superior intercostal,â€”Deep cervical. The VERTEBRAL ARTERY, the first and largest of the branches of the subclavian artery, arises from the posterior aspect of that trunk ; it ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebrae, excepting the last; then winds back- wards around the articulating process of the atlas; and, piercing406 BRANCHES OF SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. the dura mater, enters the skull through the foramen magnum. The two arteries unite at the lower border of the pons Varolii, to form the basilar artery. At its origin the artery is behind the in- ternal jugular vein, and as it ascends comes to be placed between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles ; on the left side, it iÂ« crossed by the thoracic duct. In the foramina of the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae the artery lies in front of the cervical nerves, and has the vertebral vein in front of it. The sub-occipital nerve passes out beneath it where it lies on the groove of the atlas. As i enters the cranium the vertebral artery is placed between the hypo- glossal nerve and the anterior root of the sub-occipital nerve, Ijeneath the first process of the ligamentum denticulatum ; it next winds round the medulla and lies between it and the basilar jiortion of the occipital bone. If the two arteries differ in size, the left is generally the larger. The basilar artery formed by the union of the two vertebrals is so named from its position at the base of the brain ; it runs forward in the groove on the midline of the pons Varolii, and at the anterior border of the pons di\ddes into four terminal branches, two to each side. Branches.â€”The branches of the vertebral artery are the fol- lowing :â€” Lateral spinal, Anterior spinal. Muscular, or Sub-occipital, Posterior spinal. Posterior meningeal. Posterior inferior cerebellar. Thfe lateral spinal branches enter the intervertebral foramina, and taking the course of the roots of the spinal nerves, reach the spinal canals, where each divides into two branches, one to be distri- buted to the spinal cord, anastomosing Mdth the other spinal arteries, and the second branch passing to the body of the vertebra. The muscular or sub-occipital branches are distributed to the deep muscles of the neck, as the vertebral artery curves round the articular process of the atlas ; they anastomose with the deep cervical and occipital arteries. The posterior meningeal are one or two small branches which enter the cranium tlu-ough the foramen magnum, to be distributed to the dura mater of the cerebellar fossae, and to the falx cerebelli. The anterior spinal is a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side on the front of the medulla oblongata. The artery formed by the union of these two vessels descends along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, to which it distributes branches ; they anastomose with the other spinal arteries. The posterior spinal winds around the medulla oblongata to the iiosterior aspect of the cord, and descends on each side to the cauda equina. It communicates very freely with the spinal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and near its origin sends a branch upwards to the fourth ventricle.

They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve m their course, and anastomose with the superior cerebellar arteries. The branches of the basilar artery are :â€” Transverse, Superior cerebellar, Posterior cerebral. The transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Varolii and adjacent parts of the brain. One of these branches, larger than the rest, receives the name of anterior inferior cere- bellar artery ; it passes along the crus cerebelli to be distributed to the anterior border of the cerebellum, and anastomoses with the inferior cerebellar of the vertebral. Another small branch of the basilar is known as the auditory artery ; it accompanies the facial and auditory nerves into the meatus auditorius internus, and is distributed to the internal ear. The superior cerebellar arteries, two of the terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are distributed to the upper surface of the cerebellum, inosculating with the inferior cerebellar. 2 CBRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 402 The posterior cerebral arteries, the other two terminal branches of tlie basilar, wind around the cms cerebri at each side, and are distril)uted to the posterior lobes of tlie cerebrum. Tliey are sepa- rated from the superior cerebellar arteries near their origin, by the third pair of nerves, and are in close relation with the lourth paii- in their course around the crura cerebri. Anteriorly, near tlieii- origin, they give oft' a tuft of small medullary vessels which enter the locus perforatus to supply the optic thalamus and corpora quad- rigeinina. They I'eceive the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid, and send a branch called posterior clwroid, to the velum interpositum and choroid plexus. The communications established between the anterior cerebral arteries in front, and the internal carotids and jjosterior cerebi'al arteries behind, by the communicating arteries, constitute the circle of Willis. This remarkable vascular communication at the Ijase of the brain is formed l)y the anterior communicating branch, anterior cerebrals, and internal carotid arteries in front, and by the posterioi' communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery behind. A more full description of the arteries of the brain will l^e found in Part VI. The INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY arises from the under side of the subclavian, and })asses down behind the subclavian vein to the cartilage of the first rib. It then descends by the side of the sternum, resting on the cartilages of the ribs, to the level of the sixth intercostal space, where it divides into two terminal branches, superior epigastric and musciilo-phrenic. At its origin the artery is covered by the internal jugular and subclavian veins, and as it enters the chest it is crossed by the phrenic nerve ; it then gets under cover of the pleura, and lower down lies between the triangularis sterni and internal intercostal muscles. The branches of the internal mammary areâ€” Comes nervi phrenici, Anterior intercostal. Mediastinal, Perforating, Pericardiac, Musculo-phrenic, _ Thymic, Superior epigastric. The comes nervi phrenici, a long and slender branch given oft" by the artery as it enters the chest, descends with the phrenic nerve between the pleura and pericardium to the diaphragm, to which it is distributed, inosculating with the musculo-phrenic and abdominal phrenic arteries. The mediastinal, pericardiac, and thymic branches are small vessels distributed to the anterior mediastinum, pericardium, and thymus gland. Some sternal branches are sent to supply the ster- num and triangularis sterni muscle. The anterior intercostals supply the intercostal muscles of the front of the chest, and inosculate with the aortic intercostals ; to each space there are two arteries which either arise separately orINTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. 403 by common trunks and run along the borders of the rib. Besides supplying the intercostal muscles, they send branches to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. The perforating arteries pass forward to the front of the chest througli the first six intercostal spaces ; they then turn outwards, and after giving some bi'anches to the front of the sternum, are dis- tributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. Those intended for the mammaiy gland are of larger size than the rest. The musculo-phrenic artery, proceeding from the internal mam- mary at the interspace between the sixth and seventh ribs, passes downwards and outwards over the cartilages of the false ribs to the last intercostal space. It pierces the diaphragm at the attachment of that muscle to the eighth rib, and sends branches to its muscular structure, and others to the intercostal spaces of the false ribs which form the anterior intercostal arteries of those spaces, and are dis- tributed in the same way as those above described. The superior epigastric artery descends in the sheath of the rectus muscle, and gives off branches which are distributed to the muscles of the abdominal wall. It anastomoses with the deep ej)igastric, a branch of the external iliac. The mammary arteries are remarkable for the number of their inosculations, and for the distant parts of the arterial system which they serve to connect. They anastomose with each other, and their inosculations, with the thoracic aorta, encircle the thorax. On the parietes of this cavity their branches connect the axillary and sub- clavian arteries : on the diaphragm they form a link in the chain of inosculations between the subclavian artery and abdominal aorta ; and in the parietes of the abdomen they form an anastomosis most remarkable for the distance between those vessels which it serves to connectâ€”namely, the arteries of the superior and inferior extremities. The THYROID AXIS is a short trunk which arises from the front of the subclavian close to the inner border of the anterior scalenus, and divides almost immediately into three branches, inferior thyroid, supra-scapular, and transversalis colli. ' The INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY ascends obliquely in a ser- pentine course behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, and in front of the longus colli, to the inferior and posterior part of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed. It is in relation with the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, which lies in front of it. It gives off the following branches :â€” Inferior laryngeal. Ascending cer\-ical. The inferior laryngeal accompanies the recurrent laryngeal nerve to the larynx and is distributed to the muscles and mucous meni- Tracheal, CEsophageal. brane.BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, 404 The tracheal and oesophageal branches ramify on the trachea and u},soph!igus. The ascending cervical, a branch of the inferior thyroid, ascends upon the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical verteljra3, lying in the groove between the scalenus anticus and rectus anticus major. It is distributed to the deep muscles and glands of the necli, and sends branches through the intervertel)ral foi'amina to supply the s])inal cord and its membranes. The glandular branches pass to the thyroid Ijody and anastomose with the bi'anches of the superior thyroid artery. The muscular branches supply the scalenus anticus, longus colli, and depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. The SUPRA-SCAPULAR or TRANSVERSALIS HUMERI ARTERY passes oblitpiely outwards behind the clavicle, and over the ligament of the supra-scapular notch, to tlie supra-spinous fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus mus- cle, phrenic nerve, and subclavian artery ; is distributed to the mus- cles of the dorsum of the scajiula, and inosculates with the posterior scapular, and beneath the acromion process with the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. At the supra-scapular notch it sends a large branch outwards, which pierces the trapezius muscle, and become? cutaneous at the tip of the shoulder (acromial). It gives a number of small branches to the capsule of the shoulder-joint. The supra- scapular artery sometimes arises directly from the subclavian. The' TRANSVERSALIS COLLI ARTERY passes transversely across the subclavian triangle at the root of the neck, to the anterior border of the levator anguli scapulae, where it divides into two terminal branches, the superficial cervical and posterior scapular. In its course it lies above the supra-scapular artery, and crosses the scaleni nniscles and brachial plexus of nerves, often passing between the latter, i'ts bifurcation it is covered in by the edge of the trapezius. The superficial cervical artery, its ascending branch, passe lip wards under cover of the anterior border of the trapezius, and is distributed to the superficial muscles of the neck and deep cervical glands. The posterior scapular artery, the proper contniuation of t le transversalis colli, passes backwards to the superior angle of the Fig. 256.â€”View of the branches of the right subclavian artery. 1.

In its course it lies under cover of the levator anguli scapulae and rhomboidei muscles, distributes branches to them and neighbouring muscles, and inosculates with the arteries of the scapula and branches of the intercostal arteries. The superficial cervical and posterior scapular artery sometimes arise separately, the former from the thyroid axis, the latter from the third portion of the subclavian. By means of its numerous inosculations the transversalis colli artery maintains an important anastomotic communication between the branches of the external carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The SUPERIOR INTERCOSTAL ARTERY arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anticus, and, descending in front of the necks of the first two ribs, sends intercostal branches to the first two intercostal spaces, and dorsal branches to the muscles and integument of the back. The artery lies behind the pleura, to the outer side of the sympathetic nerve, and in the second intercostal space inosculates with the first aortic intercostal. It gives off the deejj cervical artery. The deep cervical (cervicalis profunda) artery arises l)y a common trunk with the preceding, or, more properly, is a branch of the superior intercostal, corresponding with the posterior branch of the other intercostal arteries. It jjasses backwards between the transverse processes of the seventh cer\T.cal and first dorsal vertebra, and ascends the back pai't of the neck, between the complexus and semispinalis colli muscle. It inosculates with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery, and with branches of the vertebi'al. Varieties of the Subclavian Arteries.â€”Varieties in these arteries are rare ; that which most frequently occurs is the origin of the right subclavian from the left extremity of the arch of the aorta, below the left siibclavian artery. The vessel, in this case, curves behind the a'sophagus and right carotid artery, and some- times between the oesophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib on the right side of the chest, where it assumes its ordinary course. Occasionally the left carotid and subclavian arise by a common trunk, as well as those on the right, so that there are two innominate arteries, and in rare cases the four branches all arise separately from the aorta, the right subclavian, however, retaining its normal position. Varieties in the branches of the subclavian are not unfrequent; the most interesting is the origin of the left ver- tebral from the arch of the aorta. AXILLARY ARTERY. The axillary artery passes outwards and downwards with a gentle curve through the axillary space from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, where it Ijecomes the brachial. For convenience ofAXILLARY ARTERY. 4o6 description it is divided into three parts : thajlrd imrl extends from the lower border of the first rib to the upper Ijorder of the pectoralis minor ; the second part lies behind the ])ectoralis minor, and extends from the upper to the lower border of that muscle ; the third pari extends from the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major.

The superior thoracic (short thoracic), the highest of the branches ot the axillary, and sometimes derived from the next, passes inwards to the chest in front of the pectoralis minor muscle, and is distri-AXILLARY ARTERY. 4o8 buted to tlie pectoral muscles and walls of the chest. It anastomoses with the intercostal and mammary arteries. The acromial thoracic (thoracic axis) is a short trunk which proceeds froin the axillary in the space above the pectoralis minor muscle, and divides into four sets of branches : j^ectoral, which are distributed to tlie pectoral muscles, serratus magnus, and mammary ffland ; ucroviicil, which pass outwards to the acromion, and inoscu- late with branches of the supra-scapular artery; descending (thoracica humei'aria), a single branch, wlaich follows the interspace between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscle,- and is in relation with tlie cephalic vein ; and one or more clavicular branches which pass to tlie subclavius muscle and supply it. The inferior or long thoracic (external mammary) descends along the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the chest. It is distributed to the jjectoralis major and minor, serratus magnus, and mammary gland: inosculating with the superior thoracic, intercostal, and mammary arteries. The alar thoracic is a small branch distributed to the plexus of nerves and glands in the axilla. It is frequently wanting, its place being supplied by a branch derived from one of the other thoracic branches. The subscapular artery, the largest of the branches of the axillary, runs along the lower border of the subscapular muscle, to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it inosculates with the posterior scapular, a branch from the subclavian. It supplies the muscles of the under surface and inferior border of the scapula, and the side of the chest. At about an inch and a half from the axillary, it gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapulae, which passes back- wards through the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scajDular head of the triceps, and beneath the infra-spinatus muscle to the dorsum of the scapula, where it is dis- tributed, inosculating with the supra-scapular and posterior scapular arteries. The circumflex arteries wind around the neck of the humerus. The anterior, very small, passes beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and sends a branch upwards along the bicipital groove to supply the shoulder-joint; it then passes be- neath the deltoid, and distributes branches to that muscle, which anastomose with the posterior circumflex and acromial thoracic arteries. The posterior circumflex, of larger size, passes liackwards through the quadrangular space bounded by the teres minor and majoi-, the scapular head of the triceps, and humerus, and is distributed to the deltoid muscle and shoulder-joint; it anastomoses with the anterior circumflex, subscapular, acromial thoracic, and superior profunda arteries. Sometimes this artery is a branch of the superior profunda of the brachial; it then ascends behind the tendon of the teres major, and is distributed to the deltoid without passing through the quadrangular space.409 BKACHIAL ARTERY. Varieties of the Axillary Artery.â€”The most frequent pecu- liarity of this kind is the division of the vessel into two trunks of equal size : a muscular trunk, which gives off some of the ordinary axillary hrauches and supplies the npjjer arm, and a continued trunk which represents the brachial artery. The next most frequent variety is the high division of the radial which passes down the arm by the side of the brachial artery, and at the elbow takes its usual position, and is continued to its ordinary distribution in the hand. Sometimes there is a high division of the ulnar, that artery being given off in the axilla ; at the elbow it passes superficially to the muscles attached to the internal condyle, and may in life be seen and felt pulsating immediately beneath the deep fascia. BRACHIAL ARTERY. The brachial artery passes down the inner side of the arm, from the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, to a point opposite the neck of tlae radiixs, where it divides into the radial and ulnar artery.

It accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve. In its course it gives off the posterior articular artery, which descends to the elbow-joint, and a more superficial branch, which descends by the side of the external intermuscular IBRACHIAL ARTERY. septum and inosculates with the posterior interosseous recurren artery. The inferior- muscular branches of the su]jerior pi'ofuufla inosculate with the inferior profunda, auastomotica magna, and ulnar recui'i'ent. Tliis artery supplies the coraco-lirachialis, deltoid, triceps, bracliialis anticus, and the muscles attached to tlie external condyle and condylar ridge. The inferior profunda arises from about the middle of tlie brachial artery, and descends with the ulnar nerve to tlie space between the inner condyle and olecranon, where it inosculates with the posterior ulnar recurrent. It also gives a branch to the front of the internal condyle, which anastomoses with the anterior ulnar recurrent and auastomotica magna. In its course it pierces the in- ternal intermuscular septum from Ijefore backwards. The anastomotica magna is given off nearly at right angles from the brachial, at about two inches above the joint. It passes directly inwards upon the bracliialis anticus muscle, pierces the internal intermuscular septum, and winds around the humerus to inosculate with the superior profunda. On the brachialis anticus it divides into two branches, which inosculate with the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries, and with the inferior profunda. The muscular branches are distributed to the muscles in the course of the artery, namely, coraco-brachialis, biceps, deltoid, brachialis anticus, and triceps. The nutrient branch is given off at about the middle of the arm, and passes into the medullary foramen near the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle. Varieties of the Brachial Artery.â€”The most frequent pecu- liarity in the distribution of branches from this artery is the high division of the radial, which arises generally from about the upper third of the brachial artery, and descends to its normal position at the bend of the elbow. The ulnar artery sometimes arises from the brachial at about two inches above the elbow, and pursues either a superficial or deep course to the wrist ; and in some instances the interosseous artery arises from the brachial a little above the bend of the elbow. The two profunda arteries occasionally arise by a common trunk, or there may be two superior profundae. Fre- quently a small branch is given off close to the origin of the superior profunda, or is derived from that vessel; it descends over the median nerve, supplies the biceps, and unites with the radial, or (less frequently) with the ulnar. It is called vas aberrans, and sometimes replaces the brachial itself. BEND OF THE ELBOW. At the bend of the elbow the brachial artery terminates by dividing into radial and ulnar ; it here lies deeply in a triangular space which is sometimes called the antecnbital fossa. This space is bounded above by an imaginary line drawn across the arm about two inches above the condyles, on the inner side by the pronator radiiRADIAL ARTERY. 411 teres, and on the 02der side by the supinator longus ; its apex is situated below, at the point where the pronator teres and supinator longus come in contact. The floor is formed by the lower part of the brachialis anticus,and the oblique fibres of the supinator brevis. The contents of the space, enumerated from within outwards, are the median nerve, brachial artery, and tlie tendon of the biceps. By displacing the supinator longus a little to the outer side, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior j)rofunda artery can be brought into view; the former here divides into radial and posterior inter- osseous nerves, and the latter anastomoses with the radial recurrent artery, but neither the nerve nor the artery are, strictly speaking, contents of the triangle. RADIAL ARTERY. The radial artery, one of the divisions of the brachial, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that trunk. It runs along the radial side of the forearm, from the bend of the elbow to the wrist; it then turns backwards around the base of the thumb, beneath its extensor tendons, and passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand. It next crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar side of the hand, forming the deep palmar arch, and terminates by inosculating with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. Relations.â€”In the upper half of its course, the radial artery is situated between the supinator longus mviscle, by which it is slightly overlapped, and the pronator radii teres ; in the lower half between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis.

At the wrist it winds round the outer side of the carpus, and lies in succession on the external lateral ligament, scaphoid, and trapezium, and is covered by the extensor tendons of the thumb, subcutaneous veins, and some twigs of the radial nerve.412 RADIAL ARTERY. In the hand it rests on the bases of the metacarpal hones and tl._ interossei muscles, and is covered by the flexor tendons, flexor longus pollicis, lumbricales, opponens minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and flexor brevis pollicis. It is accompanied by the deep ulnar nerve. Tlie branches of the radial artery may be arranged into tliree groups, corresponding with the three regionsâ€”forearm, wrist, and hand ; they areâ€” Forearm. Radial recurrent, Muscular. Wrist. Superficialis volae, Metacarpal, Anterior carpal, Dorsales pollicis, Posterior carpal, Dorsalis indicis. Hand. Pi'inceps pollicis, Interosseous, Radialis indicis. Perforating, Recurrent. The radial recurrent branch is given ofl" immediately below the elbow ; it ascends in the space between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, sends branches to the muscles arising from the external condyle, and inosculates with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches are distributed to the muscles of the radial border of the forearm. The superficialis volae is given off by the radial artery while at the wrist. It passes between the fibres of the abductor pollicis muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. This artery is variable in size, being sometimes as large as the continuation of the radial, at other times a mere muscular twig, or entirely wanting; when of large size it supplies the palmiir side of the thumb and radial side of the index finger. The anterior carpal passes inwards along the lower border of the pronator quadratus, and forms an arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. From this arch twigs are given off to supply the wrist-joint. The posterior carpal arises from the radial artery beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; it crosses the carpus transversely, and inosculates with the ]30sterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Superiorly it inosculates with the termination of the anterior inter- osseous artery ; inferiorly it gives off dorsal interosseous branches, which anastomose with the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, and run forward upon the dorsal interosseous muscles of the third and fourth metacarpal spaces. The metacarpal oi- first dorsal interosseous branch often arises in common with the posterior carpal; it runs forward to the meta-413 EADIAL ARTERY. carpal space between the index and middle finger. At the cleft of the fingers it inosculates with the palmar digital artery, and gives off dorsal collateral branches. It is joined by a perforating branch from the deep palmar arch which reaches it by passing between the heads of tlie second dor- sal interosseous muscle. The dorsales poUi- cis are two small branches which run along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb. The dorsalis indicis is a very small branch which runs along the radial border of the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the in- dex finger. The princeps poUi- cis (arteria magna pol- licis), the great artery of the thumb, passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, between the first dor- sal interosseous (ab- ductor indicis) and flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the first pha- lanx ; and, between the two heads of the latter muscle, in the groove of the tendon of the flexor longus, it divides into two collateral branches for the palmar borders of the thumb. The radialis indi- cis, the digital branch of the radial side of the index finger, is directed inwards, between the first dorsal interosseous muscle and flexor brevis and adductor polhcis, to the side of the finger, along which it runs, ibrmihg Its radial collateral artery, and anastomosing with the digital branch from the superficial arch. Near its origin it gives off a small branch (more frequently a direct branch of the radial), which inosculates with the superficial palmar arch, and often also eftects a communication with the artery of the thumb. The palmar interosseous, "three or four in number, are branches Fig. 258.â€”Arteries of the forearm. I. Biceps. 2.

The perforating branches, three in number, pass directly back- wards between the heads of the dorsal interosseous muscles, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch pass upwards in front of the wrist-joint, and inosculate witli the arterial arch I'ormed by the anterior carpal arteries. ULNAR ARTERY. The ulnar artery, the other and larger division of the brachial, crosses the forearm obliquely, to the commencement of its middle third ; it then runs down the ulnar side of the forearm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament into the hand, and forms the superficial palmar arch which terminates by inosculating with the superficialis. volae. Relations.â€”In the upper or oblique portion of its course it lies upon the brachialis anticus and flexor profundus digitorum, and is covered in by the superficial layer of muscles of the forearm and median nerve. In the second part of its course, it is placed upon the flexor profundus and pronator quadratus, lying between the flexor carpi uinaris and flexor sublimis digitorum. While crossing the annular ligament it is protected from injury by a strong tendinous arch, thrown over it from the pisiform bone ; and in the palm it rests on the origin of the muscles of the little finger, and the tendons of the flexor sublimis, being covered in by the palmaris brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accomi^anied in its course by the venae comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two- thirds of its extent, the nerve lying to its ulnar side.

' ( Digital. The anterior ulnar recurrent, arising immediately below the elbow, ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and brachialis anticus; it distributes branches to the adjacent muscles, and inosculates with the anastomotica magna and infe- rior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by a common trunk. The posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the preceding, arises immediately below the elbow -joint, and passes backwards, beneath the origin of the superficial layer of muscles ; it then ascends be- tween the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, lying beneath the ulnar nerve, and inosculates with the inferior profunda, anastomotica magna, and interosseous recurrent. The INTEROSSEOUS ARTERY is a short trunk which arises from the ulnar, opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, and passes backwards to the interosseous membrane, where it divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous artery. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm upon the interosseous membrane, in company with the anterior interosseous nerve, between the flexor profundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, and behind the pronator quadratus ; it then passes through an opening in the interosseous membrane to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. The anterior interosseous artery gives off several mus- cular branches ; nutrient branches to the radius and ulna; a covi- panio7i branch to the median nerve (arteria comes nervi mediani) ; and at the upper border of the pronator quadratus, a small branch, which descends behind that muscle to inosculate with the anterior carpal arteries. The median artery is sometimes of large size, and occasionally assists in forming the superficial palmar arch. The posterior interosseous artery passes backwards through an opening between the upper part of the interosseous membrane and416 ULNAR ARTERY. the oblique ligament, and descends between the superficial and deep layer of muscles of the foiearm to tlie back of the wrist, where it inosculates witli the anterior interosseous and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. At its upper part it gives off a recurrent branch, posterior interosseous recurrent, which lo- turns upon the elbow between the anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris, and supinator brevis, and anastomoses with the posterior terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches of the ulnar artery are distributed to the muscles of the ulnar border of the forearm. The anterior carpal, a branch of small size, passes outwards upon the front of the wrist-joint, and contributes to form the anterior carpal arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal branch of the radial artery. The posterior carpal, larger than the preceding, passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle to the back of the wrist-joint, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery, and forms a loosterior carpal arch. The metacarpal, often a branch of the preceding, passes along the inner border of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and forms the dorsal collateral branch of that finger. The communicating or deep ulnar branch arises close to the annular ligament, and dips between the abductor minimi digiti and flexor brevis to inosculate with the termination of the deep palmar arch. It is accompanied by the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. The digital branches, four in number, are given off from the convexity of the superficial palmar arch. The first and smallest is distributed to the ulnar side of the little finger. The other three are short trunks, which divide between the heads of the metacarpal bones, and form the collateral branch of the radial side of the little finger, the collateral branches of the ring and middle finger, and the collateral branch of the ulnar side of the index finger. On the last phalanx, the collateral arteries communicate and form an arch, from which numerous branches are given off to the tip of the finger. The arteries of the hand are subject to frequent variety of distri- bution. THORACIC AORTA. The thoracic aorta commences at the lower border and left side of the fifth dorsal vertebra, passes slightly to the right as it descends, and terminates in front of the last dorsal vertebra by passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm. Relations.â€”The artery is situated in the posterior mediastinum of the thorax, and has behind it the vertebral column and vena azygos minor. The esophagus lies first to its right side, then in front, and at the upper surface of the diaphragm is placed to the left of the artery although still in front of it.417 BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA.

Branches.â€”The branches of the thoracic aorta are as follows :â€” The pericardiac arteries are a few small and irregular branches distributed to the pericardium. The BRONCHIAL ARTERIES, generally three in number, one for the right lung, and two for the left, vary both in size and origin ; the right often proceeding from a short trunk common to it and one of the left bronchial branches, or from the first aortic inter- costal. They take their course to the back of the root of the lung, and accompany the ramifications of the bronchial tubes through its substance, giving twigs also to the bronchial glands, oesophagus, and pericardium. The (ESOPHAGEAL ARTERIES, four or five in number, arise from the anterior part of the aorta, and are distributed to the oeso- phagus, establishing a chain of anastomoses along that tube : the superior inosculate with the bronchial arteries, and with oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries ; the inferior with similar branches of the phrenic and gastric arteries. The posterior mediastinal arteries are small twigs distributed to the lymphatic glands and areolar tissue of the posterior medias- tinum. The INTERCOSTAL arteries arise from the posterior part of the aorta ; they are nine in number at each side, the upper two inter- costal spaces being supplied by the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian. The right intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta. They ascend somewhat obliquely from their origin, and cross the vertebral column behind the thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and sympathetic nerve, to the intercostal spaces ; the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, vena azygos minor, and sympathetic. In the intercostal space, Pericardiac, Bronchial, CEsophageal, Posterior mediastinal, Intercostal.4i8 ABDOMINAL AORTA. or rather on the external intercostal muscle, each artery gives off a dorsal branch, which passes back between the transverse processes of the vertebra?, lying internally to the middle costo-transverse liga- ment, and divides into a spinal branch, which supplies the spinal cord and vertebrae., and a muscular hninch, distributed to the muscles and integument of the back. The intercostal artery then comes into relation with its vein and nerve, the former being above, the latter below, and ascends obli(iuely to the lower border of the rib, with which it conies into relation near the angle of the bone. It then runs along the lower border of the rib, lying between the two planes of intercostal muscles to the front of the chest, where it inosculates with the superior anterior intercostal branch of the in- ternal mammary. Besides the dorsal branch and several small muscular branches, the intercostal artery, at about the middle of its course, gives off a large inferior branch, which runs along the upper border of the rib below to the fore-part of the chest, and inosculates with the inferior anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary. While between the two planes of intercostal muscles, the inter- costal artery is protected i'rom pressure by little tendinous arches thrown across it and attached by each extremity to the bone. The upper pair of intercostal arteries inosculate with the superior inter- costals of the subclavian ; the lower intercostals anastomose with the lumbar and epigastric arteries in the parietes of the abdomen. The abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the aortic open- ing of the diaphragm, and between the two pillarri of that muscle. In its course downwards, it lies on the vertebral column to the left of the middle line, and terminates on the fourth lumbar vertebra, by dividing into the two common iliac arteries. Its point of bifurca- tion is situated a little below and to the left of the level of the umbilicus. Plan of the Eelations of the Abdominal Aorta. In Front.

Branches.â€”The branches of the abdominal aorta are the following: Spermatic, The PHRENIC ARTERlfiS are given off (frequently by a common trunk) from the anterior part of the aorta as soon as that vessel has emerged through the aortic opening. Passing obliquely outwards on the under surface of the diaphragm, each artery divides into two branches, an internal branch, which runs forwards and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the oesophageal open- ing ; and an external branch, which proceeds outwards towards the great circumference of the muscle, and sends branches to the supra- renal capsules. The phrenic arteries inosculate with branches of the internal mammary, intercostal, epigastric, oesophageal, gastric, hepatic, and supra-renal arteries. They are not unfrequently de- rived from the coeliac axis, or from one of its divisions, and some- times they give origin to the supra-renal arteries. The CCELIAC AXIS is the first single trunk given off by the abdominal aorta. It arises opposite the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra, is about half an iiich in length, and divides into three large brandies, gastric, hepatic, and splenic. Relations.â€”The trunk of the coeliac axis has in relation with it, in front, the lesser omentum ; on the right side, the right semilunar ganglion and lobus Spigelii of the liver ; on the left side, the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac portion of the stomach ; and beloic, the upper border of the pancreas and lesser curve of the stomach. It is completely surrounded by the solar plexus. The GASTRIC ARTERY (coronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the cculiac axis, ascends between the two layers of the lesser omentum to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, then runs along the lesser curvature to the pylorus, and inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. It is distributed to the lower extremity of tlie oesophagus and lesser curve of the stomach ; and anastomoses with the oesophageal arteries, vasa brevia of the splenic artery, and pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The HEPATIC ARTERY curves forward, and ascends along the right border of the lesser omentum to the liver, where it divides into two branches (right and left), which enter the transverse fissure, and are distributed along the portal canals to the right and left lobes.* 2 For the mode of disti-ibution of the hepatic artery within the liver, see the structural Anatomy of that organ in the Part on Splanchnology.

The pancreatico-duodenalis superior curves along the fixed border of the duodenum, partly concealed by the attachment of the pancreas, and is distributed to the pancreas and duodenum. It inosculates inferiorly with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis and pancreatic branches of the superior mesenteric artery.422 ABDOMINAL AORTA. The cystic artery, generally u biancli of the right hepatic, is of small size, and ramifies between the coats of tlie gall-bladder, pre- viously to its <listril)ution to the mucous membrane. The SPLENIC ARTERY, the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes horizontally to the left along the upper border of the pancreas, and divides into five or six large branches, which enter the hilum of the spleen, and are distributed to its structure. In its course the vessel is tortuous and serpentine, frequently making a complete turn upon itself. It lies in a narrow groove in the upper border of the pancreas, and is accompanied by the splenic vein which lies beneath it, and by the splenic plexus of nerves. The branches of the sjjlenic artery are theâ€” Pancreatica3 parvae, Vasa brevia, Pancreatica magna, Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The pancreaticae parvse are numerous small branches distributed to the pancreas, as the splenic artery runs along its upper border. One of these, larger than the rest, follows the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called pancreatica magna. The vasa brevia are five or six branches of small size which pass from the extremity of the splenic artery and its terminal branches, between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of the stomach, to which they are distributed, inosculating with branches of the gastric artery and gastro-epiploica sinistra. The gastro-epiploica sinistra appears to be the continuation of the splenic artery ; it passes forwards from left to right, along the great curve of the stomach, lying between the layers of the great omentum, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra. It is distributed to the greater curve of the stomach and great omentum. The SUPERIOR "mesenteric ARTERY, the second of the single trunks, and next in size to the celiac axis, arises from the aorta immediately below that vessel, and behind the pancreas. It jjasses forwards between the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and de- scends within the layers of the mesentery, to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates, much reduced iu size. In its course it forms a curve, the convexity being to the left, the concavity to the right; is in relation near its commencement with the portal vein, and is ac- companied by the vein of the same name, which lies in front of it, and by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. The branches of the superior mesenteric artery areâ€” Pancr eati co-duodenalis I le o- coli ca, inferior, Colica dextra, Vasa intestiiii tenuis, Colica media. The pancreatico-duodenalis inferior is a small branch which arises from the superior mesenteric while behind the pancreas, and curves upwards along the line of junction of the pancreas, and duo- denum. It supplies both those organs, and inosculates with the pancreatico-duodenal branch of the hepatic.SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 423 The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery. They vary from fifteen to twenty in number, and are distributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the ter- mination of the ileum. In their course between the layers of the mesentery, they form a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches ; from these are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches l-iG. 261.â€”C-'oiirse and distribution of the superior mesenteric- artery i.

By means of these arches a direct communication is established between all the branches given oft' from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery; the upper branch inoscuiates with the inferior paiicreatico-duodenal, the lower with the ileo-colic. The ileo-colic artery is the last branch given off by the concavityABDOMINAL AOKTA. 424 of the superior mesenteric. It descends to the right iliac fossa, and divides into branches which communicate and form arches, from which branches are distributed to the termination of the ileum, caecum, and commencement of the colon. This artery inosculates on the one hand with the termination of the mesenteric trunk ; on the other, with the colica dextra. The colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passing outwards behind the peri- toneum, divides into branches which form arches, and are distri- buted to the ascending colon. Its descending branches inosculate with the ileo-colic, the ascending with the colica media. The colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passes forward between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, where it forms arches, and is distributed to the transverse colon. It inosculates on the right with the colica dextra ; on the left, with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. The SPERMATIC ARTERIES are two small vessels which arise from the front of the aorta below the superior mesenteric; irom their origin each artery passes obliquely outwards, and accompanies the corresponding ureter along the front of the psoas muscle, to the border of the pelvis, where it is in relation with the external iliac artery. It is then directed outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and follows the course of the spermatic cord, along the spermatic canal and through the scrotum to the testicle, to which it is distri- buted. The right spermatic artery lies in front of the A'ena cava, and both vessels are accompanied by veins and by the sjjermatic plexuses of nerves. They anastomose with the deferential arteries, branches of the superior vesical, and with the cremasteric arteries. The ovarian arteries in the female correspond to the spermatic in the male. They descend into the pelvis and pass between the two layers of the broad ligaments of the uterus, to be distributed to the broad ligaments, ovaries. Fallopian tubes, and round ligaments; along the latter they are continued to the inguinal canal and labium at each side. They inosculate with the uterine arteries. The INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY, smaller than the superior, arises from the abdominal aorta, about two inches below the origin of the latter vessel, and descends between the layers of the left meso- colon, to the left iliac fossa, where it divides into three branches:â€” Colica sinistra. Sigmoid, Superior hoemorrhoidal. The colica sinistra is distributed to the descending colon ; it passes upwards and outwards behind the peritoneum, and divides into two branches, one of which ascends to inosculate with the colica media, while the other descends to communicate with the sigmoid branch. The inosculation of the colica sinistra with the colica media is the largest arterial anastomosis in the body. The sigmoid artery passes obliquely outwards behind the peri-INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 425 toueum and divides into branches which iorni arches, and are dis- tributed to the sigmoid flexure of the colon The superior branch inosculates with the colica sinistra, the inferior with the superior hjeniorrhoidal artery. . ^ ^. ,.

They ai'e sometimes branches of the phrenic or of the renal arteries. The RENAL ARTERIES (emulgent) are two large trunks given off from the sides of the aorta immediately below the superior mesen- teric artery ; the right is longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta, and passes behind the vena cava to the kidney of that side. The left is somewhat higher than the right. They divide into several large branches previously to entering the kidney, and ramify very minutely in its vascular portion. The renal arteries supply several small branches to the supra-renal capsules, and one to the ureter. The renal arteries are subject to great variation in their number and place of origin. Frequently two or three branches arise from different parts of the aorta; in other instances a single trunk springs from the front of the aorta, and divides into two branches, one for each kidney; other cases are recorded where the renal arteries spring from the common iliac, inferior mesenteric, middle sacral, and even from the internal iliac. The LUMBAR ARTERIES are four in number at each side ; they correspond with the intercostals in the chest. Each artery curves around the body of the lumbar vertebra beneath the psoas muscle, and divides into two branches: one, dorsal branch, passes backwards between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the vertebrtB and spinal cord and muscles of the back ; the other, parietal branch, taking its course behind the quadratus lumborum, sui^plies the abdominal muscles, and inosculates with branches of the internal mammary and epigastric arteries in front, the terminal twigs of the intercostals above, and the ilio-lumbar and circumflex iliac below. The first lumbar artery runs along the lower border of the last rib ; the last, along the crest of the ilium. In passing between the psoas muscle and the vertebrae, they are protected by a series of tendinous arches, which defend them and the communicating branches of the sym- pathetic nerve from pressure, during the action of the muscle. The SACRA MEDIA arises from the posterior part of the aorta just above its bifurcation, and descends along the middle of the anterior surface of the sacrum to the first piece of the coccyx, where it ter- minates by inosculating with the lateral sacral arteries. It dis- tributes branches to the rectum and anterior sacral nerves, and inosculates at either side with the lateral sacral arteries. Coccygeal Gland or Luschka's Gland.â€”Lying in front of the coccyx near its tip is a small mass, connected with the extremity of the middle sacral artery, and named by Luschka, who first described it, the coccygeal gland. It consists of a number of small arteries with terminal dilatations like minute aneurisms, held together by fibrous tissue, Avhich also forms a capsule for the whole mass ; in the meshes of the stroma one or two ganglion cells are found, and a few small nerves derived from the sympathetic prevertebral chain. It appears to be the remains of fwtal tissues.COMMON ILIAC ARTEKIES. 427 Varieties in the Branclies of the Abdominal Aorta.â€”The phrenic arteries are very rarely both derived from the aorta. One or both may be branches of the cceliac axis ; one may proceed from the gastric artery, from the renal, or from the upper lumbar. There are occasionally'three or more phrenic arteries. The coeliac axis is variable in length, and gives off its branches irregularly. _ There are sometimes two or even three hepatic arteries, one of which may be derived from the gastric or from the superior mesenteric. The colica media is sometimes derived from the hepatic artery. The spermatic arteries are variable both in origin and number. The right spermatic may be a branch of the renal; the left, of the in- ferior mesenteric. The supra-renal arteries may be derived from the phrenic or renal arteries. COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. The abdominal aorta divides opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra (or the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth) into the two common iliac arteries. Sometimes the bifurcation takes place as high as the third, and occasionally as low as the fifth. The common iliac arteries are about two inches in length ; they diverge from the termination of the aorta, and pass downwards and outwards at each side to the margin of the pelvis, opposite the sacro-iliac sym- physis, where they divide into the internal and external iliac. In old persons the common iliac arteries are more or less dilated and curved in their course. The right artery is somewhat longer than the left, and forms a more obtuse angle with the termination of the aorta ; the angle of bifurcation is greater in the female than in the male. Relations.â€”The relations of the two arteries are different at the two sides of the body. The right common iliac is in relation in front with the peritoneum, small intestines and sympathetic nerves, and is crossed at its bifurcation by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the two common iliac veins and last lumbar vertebra, and externally with the psoas magnus, vena cava, and right common iliac vein. The left is in relation in front with the peritoneum and sympathetic nerves, and is crossed by the rectum and superior hsemorrhoidal artery, and, at its bifurcation, by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the left common iliac vein and last lumbar vertebra, and externallv with the psoas magnus. The INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY is a short trunk, varying in length from an incli to two inches. It descends obliquely forwards to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk. In the fcetus, the internal iliac artery, under the name of hypogastric or umbilical, is continued onwards by the side of the upper part of the bladder to near its apex, whence it ascends by the side of the linea alba and urachus to the umbilicus, where it becomes the true um- bilical artery. After birth, this artery ceases to be pervious beyondINTEKNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 428 the side of the bladder, and the obliterated portion is converted into a fibrous cord.

The superior vesical arteries are three or four small branches, which proceed from the pervious portion of the umbilical artery. They are distributed to the upper and middle part of the bladder. From one of these there passes off a small artery, the deferential, â– which accompanies the vas deferens to the spermatic cord. The inferior vesical, somewhat larger than the preceding, passes down upon the side of the bladder to its base, and is distributed to rhat region, the vesicular seminales, and prostate gland. The middle hsemorrhoidal artery, frequently a branch of the preceding, passes downwards to the rectum, to which it is distri- buted, inosculating with the superior and inferior ha^morrhoidal arteries. In the female it distributes branches to the A^agina. The uterine artery passes inwards between the layers of the broad ligament to the neck of the uterus, and ascends in a tortuous course along its lateral border. It gives branches to the vagina, lower part of the bladder, Fallopian tube (htharia), ovary (ovaria), and round ligament, and inosculates with the spermatic or ovarian artery. The vaginal artery corresponds in position with the inferior vesical in the male, and is distributed to the vagina and neighbour- ing parts of the bladder and rectum. The OBTURATOR ARTERY (arising frequently from the posterior trunk of the internal iliac) passes forwards from the ante- rior trunk, a little below the brim of the pelvis, to the upper border of the obturator fora- men. Escaping from the pel- vis through a tendinous arch formed by the obturator mem- brane, it divides into two branches, internal and exter- nal. Its branches within the pel- vis areâ€”an iliac branch, which supplies the bone of the iliac fossa, and inosculates with the ilio-lumbar arteiy ; and a Fig. 264.-irregular origin of obturator artery jnibic branch which is given epigastric. Second variety internal off close to the obturator fora- """'^'^ men, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, behind the pubes, and with the pubic branch of the deep epigastric artery. The lyiternal branch curves inwards around the bony margin "of the obturator foramen, and distributes twigs to the obturator and adductor muscles, inosculating with the internal circumflex artery of the femoral. The external branch winds around the outer margin of the obturatorINTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 43Â° foramen to the space between the gemellus inferior and quadratuf; I'emoiis, where it inosculates with the ischiatic artery. In its course it inosculates also with the internal circumflex, and sends a small branch through the notch in the acetabulum to supply the liga- mentum teres. The obturator artery sometimes arises from the external iliac, but more frequently from the epigastric branch of that artery, in which case it runs down directly to the obturator foramen, either on the outer or inner side of the crural ring,â€”if to the inner side it is in contact with Gimbernat's ligament, and is in danger in the operation for femoral hernia ; fortunately it is but rarely found in this dan- gerous position. The ISCHIATIC ARTERY is thfelarger of the two terminal branches of the anterior division of the internal iliac. It passes downward.'; in front of the pyriformis and sacral plexus of nerves, lying inter- nally to the pudic artery, to the lower part of the great ischiatic foramen, where it escapes from the pelvis between the inferior border of the pyriformis and coccygeus. It then descends in the space between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium in company with the ischiatic nerves, and divides into several branches, the principal of which areâ€”coccygeal, inferior gluteal, comes nervi ischiatici, and muscular. The coccygeal branch pierces the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, and is distributed to the coccygeus and levator ani, and to the integument around the anus and coccyx. The inferior gluteal branches, three or four in number and of large size, are distributed to the gluteiis maximiis muscle, anasto- mosing with branches of the superior gluteal artery. The comes nervi ischiatici is a slender l^ranch, which accom- panies the great ischiatic nerve, extending as far as the lower part of the thigh. The muscular branches supply the muscles of the posterior part of the hip and thigh, and inosculate with the internal and ex- ternal circumflex arteries, obturator, and sixperior perforating ; some branches are also sent to the hip-joint. The INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY, the other terminal branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, descends externally to the ischiatic artery to the lower j)art of the great ischiatic foramen. It emerges from the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen between the lower border of the j)yriformis and the coccygeus, crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen ; in the next place it passes forward on the internal obturator muscle, enclosed in the sheath of obturator fascia forming Alcock's canal, to the ramus of the ischium, being situated at about an inch from the margin of the tuberosity; it then ascends by the side of the ramus of the ischium and pubes, and near the symphysis pubis pierces the triangular ligament of the perineum and divides into two terminal branclies, the artery of the corpus cavernosum and the arteiy of the dorsum of the penis.INTEENAL PUDIC AETERY. 431 Branches â€”The branches of the internal pudic artery within the pelvis are several small twigs to the levator ani and sacral nerves ; and occasionally a branch which takes the place of the inferior vesical or middle hasmorrhoidal artery.

They cross the ischio-rectal fossa, and are distri- buted to the anus and to the muscles and integument of the anal region of the perineum, anastomosing with the branches of tlie middle hajmorrhoidal. Tlie superficial perineal artery is given off neai- the attachment of the crus petiis ; it pierces the connecting layer of the perineal fascia and triangular ligament, and runs forward across the trans- versus perinei muscle, and along the groove between the accelerator urinae and erector penis to the septum scroti, upon Avhich it ramifies under the name of arteria septi. It distributes branches to the scrotum and perineum. One of the latter, larger than the rest,INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 432 crosses tlie perinevmi, resting on the transversiis perinei muscle, and is named the transverse perineal. Tliere are often two su])erficial perineal arteries. The artery of the bulb is given off from the pudic nearly opposit<; the opening for the transmission of the urethra; it passes almost transversely inwards behind the triangular ligament, and pierces that ligament to enter the corpus spongiosum at its bulbous ex- tremity. It is distributed in the corpus sj)ongiosum and gives a small branch downwards to Cowper's gland. The artery of the corpus cavernosum pierces the crus penis, and runs forward in the interior of the corpus cavernosum, Ijy the side of the septum pectiniforme. It ramifies in the parenchyma of the venous structure of the corpus cavernosum. The dorsal artery of the penis ascends l^etween the two crura and symphysis piibis to the dorsum penis, and rims forward through the suspensory ligament, in the groove of the corpus cavernosum, to the glans, distributing branches in its course to the body of the organ and integument. The pudic artery is sometimes small, and fails to give off some of its branches ; in such cases its distribution is supplemented by a separate artery called the accessory pudic. This branch is generally derived from the pudic before that vessel passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, but it sometimes springs from the inferior vesical, the obturator, or some other branch of the internal iliac. It passes along the side of the base of the bladder, and the lateral aspect of the prostate gland, pierces the triangular ligament to reach the root of the penis, and divides into the artery of the bulb and the dorsal artery of the penis ; or it may terminate in the superficial perineal artery. The INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY in the female is smaller than in the male ; its branches, with their distribution, are, in principle, the same. The superficial perineal artery supplies the homologue of the lateral half of the scrotum, namely, the greater labium. The artery of the bulb supplies the bulb of the vestibule and commencement of the vagina ; the artery of the corpus cavernosum, the cavernous body of the clitoris ; and the arteria dorsalis clitoridis, the dorsum of that organ. Branches of the Posterior Trunk. The ILIO-LUMBAR ARTERY passes out between the obturator nerve and lumbo-sacral cord, and ascends beneath the external iliac vessels and psoas muscle, to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, where it divides into two branches, a himhar branch M'hich supplies the psoas and quadratus lumborum, and sends a branch through the fifth intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and it? membranes ; and an iliac branch which crosses the iliac fossa to the crest of the' ilium, and inosculates with the lumbar arteries and deep circumflex iliac; in its course it distributes branches to the iliacus and abdominal muscles.BRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC. 4'33 The LATERAL SACRAL ARTERIES are generally two in number on each side, superior and inferior. The superior jjasses inwards to the first sacral foramen, and is distributed to the contents of the spinal canal, from which it escapes by the jiosterior sacral foramen, and supplies the integument of the dorsum of the sacrum. The inferior passes do'ttTi by the side of the anterior sacral foramina to the coccyx ; it first j)ierces and then rests on the origin of the pyriformis, and sends twigs into the sacral canal to su^Dply the sacral nerves. Both arteries give brandies to the pyriformis and Fig. 266.â€”Arteries of the buttock. I. Superficial branch of the gluteal artery. 2. Gluteus medius (origin). 3. Gluteus niaximus (origin). 4.

The GLUTEAL ARTERY is the continuation of the posterior trunk ol the internal iliac ; it passes backwards l)etween the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerve through the upper part of the great sacro- ischiatic foramen and above the pyrifornds muscle, and divides into three branches, superficial, deep superior, and deep inferior ; while within the pelvis It gives off some muscular twigs to the iliacus and pyntornns, and at its escape from the pelvis, a nutrient artery to the Ilium. 2 li434 EXTEENAL ILIAC ARTERY. The superficial branch passes backwards between the gluteus maxiinus and medius, and is distributed to the gluteus maximus and to the integument of the gluteal and sacral regions. The deep superior branch passes forwards along the middle curved line of the ilium, between the gluteus medius and minimus to the anterior superior spinous process, where it inosculates witli the superficial circumflex iliac and external circumflex of the femoral. There are fret^uently two arteries occupying the place of this branch. The deep inferior branches, two or three in number, cross the gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, where they in- osculate with branches of the external circumflex and ischiatic arteries, and send branches through the gluteus minimus to supply the capsule of the hip-joint. The EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY of- each side passes obliquely downwards along the inner border of the psoas muscle, from opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis to the femoral arch, where it becomes the femoral artery.

The DEEP EPIGASTRIC ARTERY arises from the front of the external iliac near Poupart's ligament; and passing inwards between the peritoneum and transversalis fascia, ascends obliquely to the sheath of the rectus. It enters that sheath near its loAver third, passes upwards behind the rectus muscle, to which it is distributed, and, in the substance of that muscle, inosculates, near the ensiform cartilage, with the termination (superior epigastric) of the internal mammary arter}^ It lies internally to the internal alxlominal ring and immediately above the femoral ring, and is crossed near its origin by the vas deferens in the male, and the round ligament in the female.BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL ILIAC. 435 Tlie branches of tlic epigastric artery areâ€” A cremasteric branch wliich accompanies the sjjei'niatic cord, and after supplying the cremaster muscle inosculates with the spermatic artery. A pubic branch Mdiich is distributed behind the pubes, and sends a small branch of communication downwards to the obturator artery. Muscular branches which pass outwards between the abdominal nuiscles, and inosculate with the circumflex iliac, lumbar, and in- ferior intercostal arteries. Superficial branches which pierce the rectus muscle, and are dis- tribiited to the integument of the abdomen. The epigastric artery forms a prominence of the peritoneum, wliich divides the ingiiinal fossa into an internal and external j)ortion ; it is from the former that direct ingviinal hernia issues, and from the latter oblique inguinal hernia. Triangle of Hesselbach.â€”This is a small triangular space, bounded externally by the deep epigastric artery, internally by the outer edge of the rectus abdominis, and below by Poupart's ligament and the crest of the pubes. In tlais space is situated the external abdominal ring, through which both direct and oblique inguinal hernia pass. The DEEP CIRCUMFLEX ILIAC arises from the other side of the external iliac, a little below the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely along Poupart's ligament, contained in a fibrous canal formed at the junction of the trans^'ersalis and iliac fascia^,, and curving around the crest of the ilium, inosculates with the'ilio- lumbar and inferior lumbar arteries. It gives ofl:" muscular branches to the ilio-psoas, and upper end of the sartorius and tensor vagina femoris. Opposite the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, it gives off a large ascending branch, which passes upwards l)etween the internal oblique and transversalis, and divides into numerous branches which supply the abdominal muscles, and inosculate with the inferior intercostal and the lumliar arteries. FEMORAL ARTERY. Emerging horn l^eneath Poupart's ligament, the external iliac artery enters the thigh and becomes the femoral. The femoral arterv passes down the mnei- side of the thigh, from Poupart's ligament, at a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the sym]ihysis pubis, to tlie opening in the adductor magiiiis, at tlie junction of the middle with the inferior third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery. The femoral artery and vein are enclosed in a strong sheath, femoral sheath, which is formed for the greater iiart of Hs extent by hl)rous and areolar tissue, and by a process of fascia sent inwards rom the fascui lata. Near Poupart's ligament this slieath is much Jarger than tlie vessels it contains, and is continuous with the trans-FEMORAL ARTERY. 436 versalis and iliac fascia. If the slieath be opened at Ihis point the ai'teiy ha seen in contact with the outei- wall of the sheath. 'The The vein lies next the artery, being separated from it by a fibrous septum, and between tlie vein and the inner wall of the sheath, and divided from the vein by anothei- thin fibrous septum, is a triangulai- in- terval, femoral oi- crural canal, into which the sac is pvo- truded in femoral hernia. This space is occupied in the normal state of the parts by loose areo- lar tissue, and by lymphatic vessels wliich pierce the inner wall of the sheath to make tlieir way to a gland, situ- ated in the femoral or crural ring (see Fig. 235). Relations.â€” The ui^ljer third of the femoral artery is superficial, being covered only by the integument, in- guinal glands, and sui^erficial and deep Ifascia. The lower two-thii'ds are cov- rered by the sartorius muscle. To its outer dde the artery is in relation with the psoas, and vastus internus muscles, and with the femoral vein at the upper part of the thigh. Behind, it rests on the inner border of the psoas ; it is next separated from the pectineus by the femoral vein, profunda vein and artery, and then lies on the adductor longus to its termination ; near the lower border of the adductor longus it is placed in an aponeurotic sheath or canal, called Hunter's canal, formed by an arch of tendinous fiT)res, thrown from the Ijorder of the adductor longus and the bordei' of the opening in the adductor magnus, to the sid(^ of the vastus internus.

Tlie superficial external pudic arises near the superficial epi- gastric artery ; it pierces the fascia lata at the saphenous opening, and passes transversely inwards, crossing the sperniatic cord, to be distribiited to the integument of the penis and scrotum in the male, and to the labia in the female. The deep external pudic arises from the femoral a little Ijelow, and sometimes in common -wdth, the preceding ; it crosses the femoral \'ein immediately below the termination of the internal saphena vein, and resting on the jiectineus muscle reaches the inner border of the tliigh, where it pierces the fascia lata, and is distributed to the in- tegument of the external organs of generation and perineum. Both external pudics inosculate with the internal pudic artery. The PROFUNDA FEMORIS arises from the outer and posterior side of the femoral artery about one inch and a half beloM' Poupart's ligament; it passes downwards and backwards and a little outwards, behind the adductor longus muscle, jiierces the adductor magnus, and is distributed to the flexor muscles on the posterior pai't of the thigh. It is so large that it may be considered a division of the common femoral, in which case the continuation of the main trunk may be called superficial. Plan of the Relations of the Profunda Artery.

The external circumflex artery passes outwards beneath the sartorius and rectiis and in front of the cinirens muscle, crossing between the divisions of the crural nerve, and di^â– ides into three sets of branches : ascending, which pass upwards beneath the sar- torius, rectus, and tensor vaginte femoris, and inosculate with the terminal branches of the gluteal and circumflex iliac arteries ; de- scending, which pass downwards beneath the rectus and along the margin of the vastus externus muscle, distributing branches to the rectus, \'astus externus and crureus ; some of the lower twigs can lie traced as far as the knee, where they inosculate with the supei-ior articular artej'ies of tlie poy)liteal ; and transverse, which oontniue 41BRANCHES OF PROFUNDA FEMORIS. 439 the original course of the artery around the thigh, pierce the vastus externus, and anastomose with branches of the ischiatic, internal circumflex, and superior per- forating arteries. The external circumflex sup- plies the muscles of the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The internal circumflex artery winds around the inner side of the neck of the femur, passing between the pectineus and psoas, and over the upper border of the adductor bre^sds to the tendon of the obturator externus, which it accompanies to the space between the quadratus femoris and upper border of the adductor magnus. While on the obturator externus it gives off a branch wliich is distributed to that muscle, the adductor brevis, and gracilis, and anastomoses with the obturator artery. It next gives off an articular branch, which enters the hip-joint through the notch in the acetabulum; and terminates in several branches which inosculate with the is- chiatic, external circumflex, and superior per- forating arteries. The superior perforating artery passes back- wards near the lower border of the pectineus, pierces the adductor brevis and magnus near the femur, and is distributed to the posterior mus- cles of the thigh ; inosculating with the circum- Hex, ischiatic, and middle perforating arteries. The middle perforating artery pierces the tendons of the adductor breads and magnus, and is distribiited like the superior ; inosculat- ing with the superior and inferior jDerforating. From this branch is given off the nutrient artery of the femur. The inferior perforating artery is given off below the adductor brevis, and pierces the ten- don of the adductor magnus, supplying it and the flexor muscles, and inosculating with the middle perforating artery above, and the articular branches of the popliteal below. It is through the medium of the Tjranches of the profiuida which inosculate above with branches of the internal iliac, and below with those of the pop- liteal artery, that the collateral circulation is maintained in the limlj after ligature of the femoral artery. Tlie muscular branches are given oft" by the femoral artery throughout the wliole of its course.

This may be named the sv/jje-rior vmscular artery. The anastomotica magna arises from the femoral near its tei - mination at the o])ening in the adductor magnus, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The sxqoerficial branch accompanies the internal saphenous nerve to the knee, and piercing the fascia lata is distri- buted to the integument. The deep branch passes onwards through the substance of the vastus internus muscle, resting on the tendon of the ad- ductor magnus to the knee, where it inoscu- lates with the internal articular branches of the popliteal, and the recur- rent of the anterior tibial. It also sends a branch through the vastus inter- nus, which supi^lies the synovial membrane of the joint, and inosculates with the superior exter- nal articular artery and external circiimflex.

POPLITEAL ARTERY. The pojiliteal artery (Fig. 269) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

They supply the knee-joint and lower part of the femur, and give hranclies to the vasti muscles. The azygos articular artery pierces the posterior ligament of the joint, the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the crucial ligaments and synovial membrane. There are, frequently, several j^osterior articulai' arteries. Cutaneous branches pass out between the two heads of the gastrocnemius and are distributed to the skin and subcutaneous hit of the calf. The inferior articular arteries wind around the head of the tibia immediately be- low the joint, and anas- tomose with each other, the superior articular' arteries, and the re- current of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the long external lateral liga- ment of the joint, the internal beneath the in- ternal lateral ligament. They supply the knee- joint and the heads of the tibia and fibula. The muscular In-anches consist of a superior and inferior set: the former arise from the upper i)art of the artery and are distributed to the vas- tus externus and hani- sti'ing muscles ; the latter, called also the sural arteries, pass to the two heads of the gastrocnemius.

The metatarsal forms an arch across the base of the metatarsal bones, and supplies the outer side of the foot, anastomosing with the tarsal and external plantar artery. From its convex side the meta- tarsal gives off three branches, dorsal interosseous, which pass forward upon the dorsal interosseous muscles, and divide into branches (dorsal collateral) for the supply of the sides of the toes between which they are placed. At their commencement these interosseous branches receive the posterior perforating arteries from the plantar445 POSTEKIOK TIBIAL AKTERY. arch, and opposite the heads of the inetatarsaL.bones are joined l^y the anterior perforating branches from the digital arteries. The interosseous artery of the fourth interosseous sj)ace, in addition to the two dorsal collateral branches into which it bifurcates, sends a third branch to the outer side of the little toe. The dorsalis hallucis runs forward upon the first dorsal inter- osseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, one of which passes inwards beneath the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis, and is distributed to the inner border of tlie great toe, while the other, bifurcates into two dorsal collateral digital branches for the adjacent sides of the great and second toe. The arteria magna hallucis arises from the dorsalis pedis, while in the metatarsal space and just before its inosculation with the external plantar artery. It sends a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe on its plantar aspect, and bifurcates to supply the plantar collateral digital brandies of the great and second toe. POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The posterior til)ial artery j)asses obliquely downwards along the tibial side of the leg from the lower border of the jiopliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, Avhere it divides into the internal and external plantar artery. In its course it is accompanied by venae comites, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which lies to its inner side at first, and to its outer side for the rest of its course.

The PERONEAL ARTERY is given off from tlie posterior tibial at about an incli below the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; it is nearly as lai'ge as the anterior tibial artery, and passes obliquely outwards to the fibula.

It is the largest nutrient artery of bone in the body. The muscular branches of the i^osterior tiljial artery are distri- buted to the soleus and deep muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg. One of these branches is deserving of notice, a recurrent branch, which arises from the j)osterior tibial above the origin of the peroneal artery, pierces the soleus, and is distributed on the inner side of the head of the tibia, anastomosing with the inferior internal articular. The communicatiiig branch crosses the back of the tibia, about two inches above its lower end ; it passes beneath the flexor longus hallucis tendon, and unites with the communicating branch of the peroneal. The internal calcanean branches, three or four in number, proceed from the posterior tibial artery immediately before its divi- sion ; they are distributed to the integument, to the inner side of the OS calcis, and to the muscles whicli arise from its inner tuber- osity ; and anastomose with the external calcanean branches of the posterior peroneal, and with all the neighbour- ing arteries. forming around the heel a net- Avork of inosculations, rete calcaiieum. PLANTAR AR- TERIES.

Branches.â€”Tlie branches of the external plantaj- artery are theâ€” Muscuhir, DVt 1 ^ collateral, Articular, digital, ^ pei-forating. Posterior perforating. The muscular and articular branches are distriljuted to the muscles of the sole of the foot and to the articulations of the tarsus. The digital branches are four in number ; the first is distributed . to the outer side of the little toe ; the three others pass forward to the cleft between the toes, and divide into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the three external toes, and the outei' side of the second. At the bifurcation of the toes, a small branch is sent upwards from each digital artery, to inosculate vnth the dorsal interosseous branclies of the metatarsal; these are the anterior per- forating arteries. The posterior perforating are three small branches which pass upwards between the heads of the three external dorsal interos- seous muscles to inosculate with the arch formed by the metatarsal artery. Varieties in the Arteries of the Lower Extremity.â€”The femoral artery occasionally divides at Poupart's ligament into t\wo branches, and sometimes into three ; the former is an instance of the high division of the profunda artery ; and in the latter the Ijranches are the profunda, superficial femoral, and internal circumilex. Tlie point of origin of the profunda artery varies considerably in different subjects, being sometimes nearer to and sometimes farther from Pou]3art's ligament, but more frequently the former. The branches of the popliteal artery are very liable to variety in size ; and in all these cases the compensating principle, so constant in the vascular system, is manifested. "When the anterior til)ial is of small size, the peroneal is large ; and in place of dividing into two terminal branches at the lower third of the leg, descends to the lower part of the inter- osseous membrane, and emerges upon the front of the ankle, to supply the dorsum of the foot, or the posterior tibial and plantar arteries are large, and the external plantar is continued between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, to be distributed to the dorsal surface of the foot. Sometimes the posterior tibial artery is small and thread-like ; and the peroneal, after descending to the ankle, curves inwards to the inner malleolus, and divides into two plantar arteries. If, in this case, the jjosterior tibial be sufficiently large to reach the ankle, it inosculates with the peroneal previously to the division of the latter. The internal plantar artery sometimes takes the distribution of the external plantar, which is short, and diminutive, and the latter not unfrequently replaces a deficient dorsalis pedis.PULMONARY ARTERY. 449 PULMONARY ARTERY. The pulmonary artery lias no connection with the general arterial distribution, but forms part of the lesser or pulmonary circulation. It is called an artery because it is engaged in conveying blood from the heart, but it must not be forgotten that it carries impure or venous blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. It arises from the left side of the base of the right ventricle in front of the origin of the aorta, and ascends obliquely for the space of two inches to the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into the right and left pulmonary artery. In its course upwards and backwards it inclines to the left side, crossing the commencement of the aorta, and is connected by the root of its left branch to the under surface of the arch by a thick and impervious cord, the remains of the ductus arteriosus of the foetus. Relations.â€”It is enclosed for nearly the whole of its extent by the pericardium, and receives the attachment of the fibrovis portion of that membrane by its upper portion. Behind, it rests against the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta and left auricle ; on either side is the appendix of the corresponding auricle, and a coronary artery; and above, the superficial cardiac plexus, and the cord of > the ductus arteriosus. The right pulmonary artery, longer and somewhat larger than the left, passes transversely outwards behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava to the root of the right lung, where it divides into two branches, the lower supplying the lower lobe, and the upper the other two lobes. In its course it lies parallel with and in front of the right bronchus. The left pulmonary artery, shorter and smaller than the right, crosses the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. VEINS. The veins are the vessels which carry the blood back from the capillaries to the heart. They are larger, more numerous, and anastomose more freely than the arteries, and form two great systems of vessels, the superficial and the deep, the former lying between the superficial and deep layers of the superficial fascia, and the latter accompanying the arteries in their distribution ; the two systems have very numerous communications The veins will be described according to the primary division of the body, taking first, those of the head and neck ; next,, those of the upper extremity ; tlien, those of the lower extremity ; and lastlv, the veins of the trunk, 2 F45Â° VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The veins of the head and neck may be arranged into three groups, namely, veins of the exterior of the head, veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium, veins of the neck. The veins of the exterior of the head are theâ€” Facial, Internal maxillary. Temporal, Temporo-maxillary, Posterior auricular. Occipital. The facial vein commences on the anterior part of the head in a venous plexus, formed by the communications of the branches of the temjDoral, and descends along the middle line of the forehead, under the name of frontal vein, to the root of the nose, where it is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a communicating trunk, the nasal arch. There are usually two frontal veins, which communicate by a transverse inosculation ; but sometimes the vein is single and bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. From the nasal arch the frontal is con- tinued downwards by the side of the root of the nose, and near the angle of the eye, under the name of angular vein; it then passes beneath the zygomatic muscles, becomes the facial vein, and de- scends along the ante- rior border of the mas- seter muscle, crossing the body of the lower jaw by the side of the facial artery, to the submaxillary gland, and from thence to the internal jugular vein, in which it terminates.

Vidian, and spheno-palatine veins, and joins the facial beneath the zygomatic process of the superior maxillary bone ; and the veins corresponding with the branches of the facial artery. It receives also a communicating branch from the temporo-maxillary, given off from that trunk near the angle of the jaw, and often, also, the ranine vein. The internal maxillary vein receives the veins from the zygo- matic and pterygoid fossae, which correspond generally with the branches of the internal maxillary artery ; they are so numerous and communicate so freely as to constitute a j^terygoid plexus, which is placed between the temporal and external pterygoid muscles. This plexus sends a small branch through the foramen Vesalii to join the cavernous sinus. Passing backwards behind the neck of the lower jaw, the internal maxillary joins the temporal to form the temporo- maxillary vein. The temporal vein commences on the vertex of the head by a plexiform network, which is continuous with the frontal, opjoosite temporal, auricular, and occipital veins. The ramifications of this plexus form an anterior and posterior branch which unite imme- diately above the zygoma; the trunk is here joined by another large vein, the middle temporal, which collects the blood from the temporal muscle and outer segment of the orbit, and pierces the temporal fascia near the root of the zygoma. The temj)oral vein then descends in the substance of the parotid gland and a little below the neck of the lower jaw joins with the internal maxillary to form the temporo-maxillary vein. The temporal vein receives the anterior aurictdar, masseteric, transverse facial, and parotid veins. The temporo-maxillary vein, a short trunk formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillary, passes downwards in the substance of the parotid gland, lying in front of the external carotid artery; near the angle of the jaw it divides into two branches, one of which passes over the surface of the sterno-mastoid to form with the posterior auricular the external jugular ; the other joins the facial -s'ein, and forms with it a common trunk which ends in the internal jugular. The posterior auricular vein communicates Avith the plexus of the vertex of the head, and descends behind the ear to join the .superficial division of the temporo-maxillary and form the external jugular vein. It receives in its course the veins of the external ear and the stylo-mastoid vein. The occipital vein, commencing posteriorly in the plexus at the vertex of the head, follows the direction of the occipital artery, and passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of tlie neck, terminates in the deep cervical vein. It communicates with the lateral sinus by means of a large branch which passes through the mastoid foramen, the mastoid vein.VEINS OF THE DIPLOE. 452 VEINS OF THE DIPLOE. The diploci of the bones of the head is furnished in the adult with irregular sinuses (vence difloeticai), which are formed by a continua- tion of the internal coat of the veins into the osseous canals in which they are lodged. At the middle period of life these sinuses are confined to separate bones ; but in old age, after the ossification of the sutures, they may be traced from one bone to the next. They receive their blood from the capillaries supplying the cellular struc- ture of the dij^loe, and terminate externally in the veins of the pericranium, internally in the veins and sinuses of the dura mater ; they are separated from the bony walls of the canals by a thin layer of marrow. Four of these dijiloetic veins can be generally distinguished, namely, frontal, anterior temporal, posterior temporal, and occipital. The frontal, the smallest of the four, escapes from the frontal bone at Fig. 274.â€”The external table of the skull removed to show the vehis of the cranial diploe. the supraorbital notch, and opens into the supraorbital vein. The anterior temporal also collects the blood from the frontal bone, and terminates either in the deep temporal veins or in the cavernous sinus, by passing throiigh an opening in the great wing of the sphenoid. The posterior temporal commences in the parietal bone, and opens through an aperture in that bone into the lateral sinus, sometimes sending a branch outwards to the veins of the scalp. The occipital, the largest of the four, originates in the occipital bone, and terminates internally in the torcular Herophili or lateral sinus, or externally in the occipital vein. Emissary Veins.â€”These are small veins which pass through the walls of the skull and establish communications between the sinuses and the veins on the exterior of the skull; they are large in the young child, but small and inconstant in the adult. The chief emissary vein are as follows:â€”(i) A mastoid bi-anch, passingCEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. 453 througli tlie mastoid foramen, and connecting the lateral sinus witli the occipital or posterior auricular vein ; (2) a parietal branch (in- constant), passing through the parietal foramen and connecting the superior longitudinal sinus with the veins of the scalp ; (3) a nasal branch, transmitted by the foramen ctecuni and connecting the nasal veins with the su]3erior longitudinal sinus ; (4) a condylar branch, jjassing through the j)osterior condylar foramen and form- ing a communication between the lateral sinus and the veins around the cervical vertebrae (inconstant); (5) a small vein j)assing through the foramen of Vesalius and connecting the pterygoid j)lexus of veins with the cavernous sinus (inconstant) ; (6) an occipital branch traversing the external occipital protuberance, and passing from the occipital veins to the torcular Herophili (inconstant) ; (7) small veins from the pterygoid and pharyngeal plexixses passing through the foramen ovale and foramen lacerum medius to the cavernous sinus. (8) A small venous plexus accomj)anies the internal caro- tid artery through the carotid canal and opens into the internal jugular vein ; and (9) a venous ring surrounds the hypoglossal nerve in the anterior condylar foramen, and communicates between the inferior petrosal sinus and the deep veins of the neck. CEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. The cerebral veins are remarkable for the absence of valves, and for the extreme tenuity of their coats. They may be arranged into the superficial, and deej) or ventricular veins. The superficial cerebral veins are situated on the surface of the hemispheres lying in the sulci. They are named from the position which they occupy on the surface of the brain, either superior or in- ferior, internal or external, anterior or posterior. The superior cerebral veins, ten to twelve in number at each side, pass obliquely forwards, and terminate in the superior longi- tudinal sinus, in the opposite direction to the course of the stream of blood in the sinus. In the infant the direction of these veins is nearly transverse. The inferior cerebral veins pass from the lower surface of the hemispheres to tlie cavernous, superior petrosal and lateral sinuses. One branch, of larger size than the rest, commences on the under surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and after running for some distance in the fissure of Sylvius, empties into the cavernous sinus ; it is called the middle cerebral vein. The deep or ventricular veins commence within the lateral ventricles by the veins of the corjjora striata and those of the choroid 2}lexuses, which unite to form the two venae Galeni. The venae Galeni pass backwards in the structure of the velum mterpositum ; and, after uniting, terminate in the straight sinus. They receive in their course small branches from the thalamus opticus and choroid plexus of the third ventricle. The basilar vein IS the chief triljutary of the vein of Galen, which it reaches by wind-454 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. ing round the crus cerebri ; it conveys tlie blood from the anterior cerebral veins, deep Sylvian vein, and inferior striate veins. The veins of Galen also receive branches from the corpora quadrigeruina, pineal body and posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The cerebellar veins are disposed, like those of the cerebrum, on the surface of tlie lobes of the cerebellum ; they are situated, some on the superior, some on the inferior surface, while otliers occupy the borders of the organ. Those in the middle line of the uppei' surface terminate in tlie veins of Galen and straight sinus ; those of the under surface in the lateral and occipital sinuses. SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels formed by the sj)litting of the layers of that membrane, and lined on their inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They are seventeen in number, six pairs and five single ones, and are as follows :â€” (Superior longitudinal sinus, Inferior longitudinal sinus, Straight sinus. Circular, Transverse. ' Two occipital sinuses, Two lateral sinuses, ,,o,-,.-. Two cavernous, felX pairs. -V rn â€¢ i 1 ^ 1 wo superior j)etrosal. Two inferior petrosal, ^ Two splieiio-parietal. The superior longitudinal sinus is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen csecuni in the frontal, to the inner protuberance of the occipital bone. In the young child it receives a small vein from the nose which reaches it by jjassing through the foramen caecum, and not unfrequeiitly this remains permanent in the adult. It is triangular in form, small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives the superior cerebral veins, numerous small veins from tlie diploi', and near the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture the jxtrietal veins from the pericranium and scalp. Examined in its interioi', it l^resents numerous transverse fibi'ous bands, the chordce JVillisii, which are stretched across its inferior angle ; and some small white granular masses, the glandulce Pacchioni; the oblique openings of the cerebral veins, with their valve-like margin, are also seen on the walls of the sinus. The termination of the superior longitudinal sinus forms a con- siderable dilatation, with which the straight sinus communicates in front, the lateral sinuses on each side, and the occipital sinuses below. This dilatation is generally situated to the right of the455 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATEE. middle line, and is named the torcular Herophili. It is con- tinuous with the lateral sinus of the same side, and communicates, by a transverse channel, with the commencement of the lateral sinus of the opposite side. The inferior longitudinal sinus is situated in the free margin of the falx cerebri; it is cylindrical in form, and extends from near the crista galli to the anterior border of the tentorium, where it termi- 2iates in the straight sinus. It receives in its course several veins from the falx and sometimes one or two from the internal surface of the hemispheres. The straight sinus is the sinus of the tentorium ; it is situated at the line of union of the falx with the tentorium ; is prismoid in form, and extends across the tentorium, terminating by bending outwards in a direction opposite to that taken by the superior Fig. 275.â€”Sinuses of the upper and back part of the skull.

Besides the inferior longitudinal sinus it receives the vence Galeni, the cerebral veins from the inferior part of the posterior lobes, and the superior cerebellar veins. The circular sinus is situated in the sella turcica, surrounding the pituitary body ; it consists of an anterior and posterior portion, the former being usually the larger. It receives veins from the pituitary body, the dura mater and the bone, and forms a communi- cation between the two cavernous sinuses. The transverse or basilar sinus consists of a plexus of veins lying on the basilar portion of the occipital bone. It communicates with the two inferior petrosal sinuses, and with the anterior spinal veins. The occipital sinuses are two canals of small size, situated at the back of the foramen magnum ; as they ascend they unite to form a456 SINUSES OF THE DURA.

They communicate with the posterior spinal veins, and not vmfrequently with the ter- mination of the lateral sinuses. The lateral sinuses are vari- able in their origin, but most frequently the right is formed by the superior longitudinal sinus and the left by the straight sinus. They pass outwards, in the attached margin of the tentorium, and then curve doAvn- wards and inwards along the base of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, at each side, to the posterior compartment of the jugular foramina, where they terminate in the internal jugu- lar veins. Each sinus rests in its course on the lateral groove of the occijDital bone, posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid ijortion of the temporal, and again on the occij^ital bone.

Besides the ophthalmic vein the cavernous sinus receives the cerebral veins of the under part of the anterior lobe, a vein from the posterior border of the orbit and the vein of the middle fossa of the cranium. The cavernous sinuses communi- cate by means of the ojjhthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the caver- nous sinuses backwards. They run in the shallow groove formed by the lower border of the petrous jjortion of the temporal bone and the basilar portion of the occipital at each side of the base of the skull, to the jugular foramina, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the commencement of the internal jugular veins. The superior petrosal sinuses pass obliquely backwards along the attached border of the tentorium, on the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and establish a communication between the cavernous and lateral sinus at each side. They are of very small size, and receive one or two cerebral veins from the inferior part of the middle lobes, and a cerebellar vein from the anterior border of the cerebellum. Near the extremity of the petrous bone these sinuses cross the oval aperture which transmits the fifth nerve (Meckel's s-pace).OPHTHALMIC VEINS. 458 The spheno-parietal sinuses are two minute blood-channels which run under the border of the lesser wing of the sphenoid. They commence by small meningeal veins, and terminate in the commencement of the cavernous sinuses. OPHTHALMIC VEINS.â€”The veins of each orbit are two in number. superior and iyiferior. The superior ophthalmic vein, much the larger of the two, commences near the root of the nose by com- munications with the angular and supra-orbital branches of the facial vein ; it runs along the inner side of the orbit with the oph- thalmic artery, then crosses the optic nerve from within outwards, and passing through the sphenoidal fissure joins the cavernous sinus. Its tributaries are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, anterior and jjosterior ciliary, central vein of the retina, muscular, and lachrymal veins. The inferior ophthalmic vein is derived from the posterior ciliary and inferior muscular branches, it runs near the floor of the orbit, communicates through the spheno-maxillary fissure ^vith the pterygoid plexus, and terminates in the same way as the ujoper branch, which it often joins. VEINS OF THE NECK. The veins of the neck which return the blood from the head areâ€” External jugular, Internal jugular, Anterior jugular. Vertebral. The external jugular vein, the continuation of the superficial division of the temporo-maxillary, augmented by the junction of the posterior auricular, and sometimes of the occii^ital, commences at the lower border of the parotid gland, in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It descends the neck in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the lower jaw to the middle of the clavicle, crosses the sterno-mastoid, and terminates near the posterior and inferior attach- ment of that muscle, in the subclavian vein. It is provided with two pairs of valves, one situated near its entrance into the subclavian vein, and the other about the middle of the neck. In its course downwards, it lies on the anterior lamella of the deep cerWcal fascia, which separates it from the sterno-mastoid muscle, and is covered in by the platysma myoides and superficial fascia; at the root of the neck it pierces the deep cervical fascia. It is accom- panied, for the upper half of its course, l)y the auricularis magnus nerve. The branches which it receives are the occipital cutaneous and posterior cervical cutaneous, and, near its termination, the supra-scapular and posterior scapular. Frequently a branch of considerable size, called posterior external jugular, collects the blood from the occipital region and muscles of the back of the neck ; it runs between the splenius and trapezius, and joins the external jugular about the middle of its course.VEINS OF THE NECK. 459 Tlie anterior jugular vein conmiences on the os liyoides by several small veins and by a branch from the temporo-maxillary, and passes downwards along the mid-line of the neck to the sternum ; it then turns outwards behind the lower part of the sterno-mastoid and opens into the subclavian vein, near the termination of the external jugular. The two veins communicate with each other, and with the external and internal jugular veins. The anterior jugular is very variable in size, sometimes almost or entirely replacing the external jugular, and at others being represented only by a few small branches. The internal jugular vein, formed by the convergence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinus, commences at the under surface of the jugular foramen on each side of the base of the skull, by a considerable dilatation (the bulb of the internal jugular vein), and descends the side of the neck, lying, in the first instance, to the outer side of the internal carotid, then on the outer side of the common carotid artery to the root of the neck, where it unites with the subclavian, and constitutes the innominate vein. At its com- mencement, the internal jugular vein is posterior and external to the internal carotid artery and eighth, ninth, and tenth pairs of nerves, the hypoglossal nerve being behind it; lower down, the vein and artery are on the same plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves passing forwards between them, the pneumogastric being be- tween and behind in the same sheath, and the spinal accessory nerve, crossing obliquely behind or before the vein at its upper part. It is provided with a pair of valves, placed near its termination. The tributaries which the internal jugular receives in its course areâ€”pharyngeal, lingual, deep division of the temporo-maxillary, facial, middle thyroid, and sometimes the occipital. The vertebral vein descends by the side of the vertebral artery, in the canal formed by the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and at the root of the neck opens into the subclavian vein close to its termination. In the lower part of the vertebral canal it frequently divides into two branches, one of which advances forwards, while the other passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, before open- ing into the subclavian vein. On the right side it crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. The tributaries which it receives in its course are the posterior condylar vein, muscular veins, cervical meningo-rachidian veins, and near its termination the superficial and deep cervical veins. The inferior thyroid veins, two, and frequently more in number, are situated one on each side of the trachea, and receive the venous blood from the thyroid gland. They communicate with each other, and with the middle and superior thyroid veins, and form a plexus on the front of the trachea. The right vein terminates in the right innominate vein, just at its union with the superior cava ; the left in the left innominate vein.46o VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The veins of tlie ujiper extremity are deejD and superlicial. The deep veins accompany the branches and trunks of the arteries, and constitute their vence comites. The vente comites of the radial and ulnar artery are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and terminate at the bend of the elbow in the brachial veins. The brachial vense comites are situated one at each side of the artery, and open into the axillary vein ; the axillary becomes the sub- clavian, and the subclavian unites with the internal jugular to form the innominate vein. The superficial veins of the arm are theâ€” Anterior ulnar vein, Cephalic vein. Posterior ulnar vein. Median vein, Basilic vein. Median basilic, Radial vein, Median cephalic. The anterior ulnar vein collects the venous blood from the inner and palmar border of the hand, and ascends along the anterior aspect of the inner side of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it joins with the posterior ulnar to form the basilic vein. The posterior ulnar vein commences on the dorsum of the hand by the ulnar termination of the venous arch, which receives the digital veins from the fingers, and, after being joined by a large vein, the vena salvatella, frqm the little finger, ascends along the posterior aspect of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it turns for- Avard and terminates by joining the anterior ulnar vein. The basilic vein {^aa-iklKos, royal, or princii^al), formed by the union of the anterior and posterior ubiar veins, ascends along the inner side of the upper arm, receives the median basilic vein, and near its middle jjierces the fascia; it then passes upwards to the axilla, and being joined by the brachial venae comites, becomes the axillary vein. The radial vein commences on the dorsum of the hand, by the radial termination of the venous arch, which receives the veins of the fingers. This origin is increased by the junction of some small veins from the thumb, and a branch from the venae comites of the deep palmar arch. The radial vein ascends the dorsal side of the forearm to a little below its middle, then lies on its anterior aspect to the bend of the elbow, where it unites with the median cephalic, to form the cephalic vein. The cephalic vein (KetpaXrj, the head) ascends along the outer side of the upper arm to its superior third ; it then enters the groove between the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, where it is in rela- tion with the descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery, pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, and terminates beneath the clavicle in the axillary vein. A large communiediting branch some-461 VEINS OF THE UPPER ARMS. times crosses the clavicle and connects this vein with the external jugular. The median vein is intermediate in position between the ante- rior ulnar and radial veins ; it begins at the wrist by the junction of branches from the palm of the hand, and collects the blood from the anterior aspect of the forearm, com- municating with the radial and anterior ulnar. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch from the deep veins, and divides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic. The median cepha- lic vein, longer and somewhat smaller than the median basilic, passes obliquely owt- wards, in the groove between the biceps and supinator longus, to unite with the radial and form the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cutaneous nerve pass behind it. The median basilic vein, larger than the median cephalic, passes obliquely inwards, in the groove between the biceps and pronator radii teres, and joins the basilic vein. This vein is crossed by one or two filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve, and overlies the l)rachial artery, from which it is separated by the semilunar fascia of the biceps. AXILLARY VEIN.â€”The axillary vein is formed by the union of the vense comites of the brachial artery with the basilic vein. It lies to the inner side of the artery, receives numerous branches from the collateral veins of the branches of the axillary artery, and at the lower border of the first rib becomes the subclavian vein. Above the pectoralis minor it receives the cephalic vein. SUBCLAVIAN VEIN.â€”The subclavian vein crosses the first rib beneath the clavicle, and unites with the internal jugular vein to form the innominate vein. It lies at first in front of the sub- clavian artery, and then in front of the scalenus anticus, which sepa- rates it from that vessel.

The veins of the lower extremity are deep and superficial. The deejj veins accompany the branches of the arteries in pairs, and form the venae comites of the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal artery. These veins unite in the jDopliteal region to form a single ve.ssel of large size, the popliteal, which successiA'ely becomes in its course the femoral and the ex- ternal iliac vein. POPLITEAL VEIN.-The popliteal vein as- cends through the popliteal region, lying, in the first instance, superficial to the artery, and then getting somewhat to its outer side ; and, passing through the oval opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus, becomes the femoral vein. It receives several muscular and articu- lar branches, and the external saphena vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. FEMORAL VEIN.â€”The femoral vein, com- mencing at the opening in the adductor mag- nus muscle, ascends the tliigh in the sheath of the femoral artery, and entering the pelvis beneath Poupart's ligament, becomes the ex- ternal iliac vein. In the lower part of its course it is situated on the outer side of the artery ; it then becomes placed behind that vessel, and at Poupart's ligament, lies to its inner side. It receives the muscular veins and profunda, and, through the saphenous opening, the internal saphena vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. The profunda vein is formed by the con- A'ergence of the numeroixs small veins whicli accompany the branches of the artery ; it is a vein, of large size, lies in front of the profunda artery, and terminates in the femoral at about two inches Ijelow Poupart's ligament.

They commence on the dorsum of the foot in a venous arch which lies across the metatarsus ; this venous arch receives the digital veins by its convex side. The external saphena vein commences at the outer extremity of the venous arch and on the outer border of the foot. It passes behind the outer ankle, ascends along the posterior aspect of the leg, lying in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle, and jpierces the deep fascia in the popliteal region to join the i^opliteal vein. It receives several cutaneous branches in the popliteal region pre-\dously to perforating the deep fascia, and is in relation in its course witli the external saphenous nerve. The internal saphena vein commences at the inner extremity of the venous arch of the dorsum and on the inner side of the foot and great toe. It ascends in front of the inner ankle and along the inner side of the leg ; it then passes behind the inner condyle of the femur and along the inner side of the thigh to the saphenous opening where it pierces the sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminates in the femoral vein, at about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. It receives in its course the cutaneous veins of the leg and thigh, and communicates freely with the deep veins. At the saphenous opening it is joined by the superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac vein, and by the external pudics. The situa- tion of this vein in the thigh is not unfrequently occupied by two or even three trunks of nearly equal size. It is accompanied in its course below the knee by the long saphenous nerve.

The innominate veins are two large trunks, formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian vein at each side of tlie root ot the neck.464 SUPERIOK VENA CAVA. The right innominate or brachio-cephalic vein, about an inch and a quarter in length, lies superficially and externally to the in- nominate artery, and descends almost vertically to unite with its fellow of the opposite side in the formation of the superior cava. It lies superficial to and on the right side of the arteria innominata, and has on its outer side the pleura and apex of the right lung. At the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein it receives from l)ehind the ductus lymphaticus dexter, and lower down it has open- ing into it the right internal mammary, right superior intercostal, and right inferior thyroid vein. The left innominate or brachio-cephalic vein, consideraljly longer than the right, extends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta to the right side of the mediastinum, where it unites with the right innominate vein, to constitute the superior vena cava. It is in relation in front with the left sterno-clavicular articulation, remains of the thymus gland, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and first piece of the sternum. At its commencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left inferior thyroid, left mammary, and left superior intercostal vein. It also receives some small veins from the medias- tinum and thymus gland. There are no valves in the innominate veins, SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The superior cava is a short trunk about three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two innominate veins. It descends perpendicularly on the right side of the arch of the aorta, and entering the pericardium terminates in the upper part of the right auricle. It is in relation in front with the pericardium ; behind Avith the right pulmonary artery; internally with the ascending aorta and innominate artery; externally with the pleura and right phrenic nerve. It receives small mediastinal and pei icardiac veins, and, immediately before entering the pericardium, is joined by the vena azygos major. It has no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. The external iliac vein lies to the inner side of the correspond- ing artery at the os pubis ; on the right side it gradually gets behind Fig. 282.â€”Veins of the trunk, i. Right internal jugular. 2.

Immediately aljovu Poupart's ligament it receives the epigastric and deep circuniHex iliac vein ; it has no valves. The internal iliac vein is formed by vessels which correspond with the branches of the internal iliac artery; it recei-\'es the returning blood from the gluteal, ischiatic, internal pudic, and obturator vein, externally to the pelvis; and from the vesical and uterine plexuses within the j^elvis. The vein lies to the inner side of the internal iliac artery, and terminates by uniting with the ex- ternal iliac vein, to form the common iliac ; it has no valves. The vesical and prostatic plexus is an important plexus of veins which surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland, and receives its blood from the veins of the ]>i'ostate, bladder, deep perineal muscles, great dorsal vein of the penis, and the external organs of generation, it is retained in connection with the sides of the bladder by a reflection of the pelvic fascia. The hsemorrhoidal plexus consists of large A^eins with frequent anastomoses Avhich surround the lower part of the rectum, beneath the mucous membrane. From the plexus proceed the superior, middle, and inferior hcemorrhoidal veins, which -accompany the arteries of the same name. This plexus forms a direct communi- cation between the portal and general venous systems. The uterine plexus is situated around the vagina, and at the sides of the uterus, between the two layers of the broad ligament. The veins forming the vesical and uterine plexus are peculiarly sub- ject to the production of calcareous concretions termed phlebolites. The common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac vein at each side of the pelvis. The right common iliac, shorter than the left, ascends obliquely behind the correspond- ing artery ; and on the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra, unites with the vein of the opposite side, to form the inferior cava. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique than the right, ascends behind and a little internally to the corresponding artery, and j^asses beneath the right common iliac artery, near its origin, to unite with the right vein in the formation of the inferior vena cava. Each common iliac vein receives the ilio- lumbar vein, and often the lateral sacral; the left receives in additit)n the vena sacra media. These veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA. The inferior vena cava is formed l)y the union of the two common iliac veins on the intervertel^ral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. It ascends along the front of the vertebi-al colunin, to the right of the abdominal aorta, and passing through the fissure in the posterior border of the \i\ev and the quadrilateral467 VEINS OF THE ABDOMEN. opening in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, terminates in the inferior and posterior part of the right auricle. It has no valves. It is in relation from below upwards, in front with the mesentery, transverse duodenum, portal vein, pancreas, and liver, which latter nearly and sometimes completely surrounds it; behind it rests on the vertebral column and right crus of the diaphragm, from which it is separated by the right renal artery and right lumbar arteries ; to the right it has the peritoneum and sympathetic nerve; to the left the aorta. The tributaries which the inferior vena cava receives in its course are theâ€” Lumbar, Supra-renal, Eight spermatic, Inferior phrenic. Renal, Hepatic. The lumbar veins, four in number at each side, collect the venous blood from the muscles and integument of the loins, and spinal veins : the left are longer than the right on account of the position of the vena cava, and pass behind the aorta in order to reach that vessel. These veins commiinicate with each other by branches which j^ass in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae {ascending lumbar vein). The right spermatic vein is formed by the two veins which return the blood from the venous plexus of the spermatic cord (spermatic or pampiniform plexus). These veins follow the course of the spermatic artery, and unite to form the single trunk which opens into the inferior vena cava. The left spermatic vein terminates in the left renal vein. The ovarian veins represent the spermatic veins of the male, and collect the venous liloocl from the ovaries, round ligaments, and Fallopian tubes. They communicate with the uterine sinuses, and terminate as in the male. The renal or emulgent veins return the blood from the kidneys ; their branches are situated in front of the divisions of the renal arteries, and the left opens into the vena cava somewhat higher than the right. ^ The left is longer than the right in consequence of the position of the vena cava, and crosses the aorta immediately below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It receives the left spermatic vein, which terminates in it at right angles : hence the jnore frequent occurrence of varicocele on the left than on the right side ; it also receives the left inferior phrenic and left supra-renal. - The supra-renal veins terminate pai-tly in the renal veins, and partly in tlie inferior vena cava. The inferior phrenic veins return the blood from the ramifica- tions of the phrenic arteries ; they o]ien into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic veins form two principal trunks and numerous â€¢smaller channels wliich open into the inferior vena cava, while that vessel is situated in the posterior border of the liver. The hepatic veins commence in the liver by minute venules, the intralobular468 AZYGOS VEINS. veins, in the centre of each hjbule ; the.Â«e pom- their l)]ood' mUi larger vessels, the suhlohular veins; and the sublobulai- veins con- stitute, by their convergence and union, the hepatic trunkn, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. AZYGOS VEINS. The azygos veins (Fig. 282) form a system of comnuniication be- tween the superior and inferior vena cava, and serve to return the blood from that part of the trunk of the body in which those vessel.^ are deficient, on account of their connection with the heart. This system consists of four sets of vessels, namelyâ€” Vena azygos major. Vena azygos minor superior, Vena azygos minor inferior. Intercostal veins. The vena azygos major commences in the lumbar region as a continuation of the ascending lumbar vein; sometimes it is joined by a branch directly from the inferior vena cava, or by one from the renal vein. It j^asses through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, lying on the right side of the thoracic duct and aorta, and ascends along the right side of the vertebral column to the third dorsal A'ertebra, where it arches forwards over the right bi-onchus, and ter- minates in the superior vena cava. It receives all the intercostal veins of the right side with the exception of those of the lii'st space, the vena azygos minor superior and inferior, some uisophageal A'eins, and right bronchial A'ein. The vena azygos minor superior is formed by the union of tlie intercostal veins of the left side fi'om the fourth to the eighth ; it communicates with the left supeiior intercostal vein, and crosses the body of. the eighth dorsal vertebra behind the. aorta to empty into the vena azygos major. The vena azygos minor inferior commences in the luml)ar region, on the left side, as the ascending lumbar vein, or by a conmiunication witli the renal vein. It enters the chest through the left crus of the diaphragm and ascends the left side of the vertebral column, crosses the ninth doi'sal vertebra and opens into the vena azygos major. It receives the three lowei' intercostal veins of the left side and some Ijranches from the mediastinum. The azygos veins have no valves. The intercostal veins vary somewhat in their arrangement, but the following seems to be the most common disposition :â€”On the right side, the vein of the first space joins the right innominate vein, or the termination of the vertebral; the veins of the second and third, or second, third, and fourth spaces, form a common trunk which terminates in the vena azygos major as it winds round the root of the lung ; the veins of the remaining spaces empty directly into the vena azygos major. On the left side, the vein from the first space accompanies the superior intercostal artery, and empties into469 VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. the left innominate vein ;. the branches from the second and third spaces unite to form a common trunk which crosses the arch of the aorta to terminate in the left innominate vein; those from the fourtli to the eighth spaces end in the vena azygos minor superior, and tliose of tlie remaining three spaces in the vena azygos minor inferior (B. G. Morison). The bronchial veins return the blood from the structure of the lungs ; the right empties into the vena azygos major near its termi- nation, and the left in the vena azygos minor superior. VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. The niunerous venous plexuses of the vertebral column and spinal cord may be arranged into four groups :â€” 1.

The veins of the spinal cord, medulli-spinal. 1, The dorsal-spinal veins form a plexus around the spinous, transverse, and articular processes, and arches of the ^-ertebrte. They receive the returning blood from the dorsal muscles and sui'- rounding structures, and transmit it, in part to the veins inside the vertebral canal, by branches wliich perforate the ligamenta sub- ftava, and in part to the vertel^ral, intercostal, luml)ar, and sacral vein.s. 2. The meningo-rachidian veins are situated between the spinal dura mater and the vertebra;. They communicate freely with eachCAKDIAC YEIN8. 470 other by means of a complicated plexus. In front they form two longitnrlinal ti-unks (anterior longitwlinal spinal veins), extending the whole length of the column on each side of the posterior common ligament, and are joined on the body of each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large basi-vertebral veins from the interior of each vei-teljra. The pos- terior trunks (posterior longitudinal spinal veins) are smaller than the anterior; they are situated one on each side between the laminaj and the theca vertebralis ; they communicate with each other, with the anterior trunks, and with the dorsal-spinal A'eins. The meningo- rachidian veins communicate siiperiorly through the anterior con- dylar foramina with the internal jugulars ; in the neck they pour their blood into the vertebral veins ; in the thorax, into the inter- costals; and in the loins and pelvis into the lumbar and sacral veiiis, the communications being made through the intervertebral foramina. 3. The venae basis vertebrarum pass out through the large foramina in the posterior surfaces of the bodies of the vertebra?, and empty into the transverse branches of the anterior longitudinal spinal veins. They are contained in large tortuous channels in the .substance of the bones, similar to those in the diploe of the skull, and run parallel with the upper and lower surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae. The canals become greatly developed in old age. 4. The meduUi-spinal veins are situated between the pia mater and arachnoid ; they communicate freely with each other to form plexuses, and send branches through the intervertebral foramina with each of the spinal nerves, to join the veins of the trunk. The A'eins of the spine have no valves. CARDIAC VEINS. The veins returning the blood from the substance of the heart are theâ€” Great cardiac vein. Anterior cardiac veins. Posterior cardiac vein, Vente Thebesii, Right or small coronary vein. Coronary sinus. The great cardiac or coronary vein commences at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the anterior ventricular groove to the base of the ventricles ; it then curves around the left auriculo-ven- tricular groove to the posterior part of the heart, where it termi- nates in the coronary sinus, its opening being guarded by a valve of two segments. It receives in its course the left cardiac veins from the left auricle, and branches from the anterior wall of both ventricles. The posterior cardiac vein (frequently two in number)comniences also at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the posterior ventri- cular groove, to terminate in the coronary sinus. It receives, at right angles, the veins from the posterior aspect of the two ventricles. The anterior cardiac veins collect the blood from the anteriorPORTAL SYSTEM. 471 surface of the right ventricle ; one larger than the rest runs along the right border of the heart. They join to form a small trunk, which curves around the right auriculo-ventricular groove, to open directly into the auricle. The vense Thebesii are numerous minute veins which convey the venous blood directly from the substance of the heart into the right auricle. , â€¢ i â€¢ 1 The right or small coronary vein runs m the right auriculo- ventricular groove, and winds around the heart, to empty into the right end of the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus is a short but wide trunk which forms the true continuation of the great cardiac vein. It is situated at the back of the heart between the left auricle and ventricle, and is covered by the muscular fibres of the auricle ; it receives the great cardiac, posterior cardiac, and small coronary veins, and also a small vessel called the oblique vein which crosses the back of the left auricle. The coronary sinus opens into the back of the right auricle, the open- ing being guarded by a small fold of endocardium which receives the name of coronary or Thebesian valve. All the veins joining the sinus are guarded at their entrance by more or less complete valves, except tlie oblique vein. PORTAL SYSTEM. The portal system of-veins includes those belonging to the spleen, stomach, large and small intestine, and pancreas. Its vessels difter from veins in general in being devoid of valves, in terminating as well as commencing in capillaries, and in the great thickness of their muscular coat. After the blood contained in the portal vein has been distributed to the liver, it is gathered up by the hepatic veins, and conveyed into the inferior vena cava. The portal system is composed of four large veins which return the blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; they are theâ€” Inferior mesenteric vein. Splenic vein, Superior mesenteric vein, Gastric veins. The inferior mesenteric vein receives its blood from the rectum by means of the hsemorrhoidal veins, and from the sigmoid flexure and descending colon, and ascends behind the transverse duodenum and pancreas, to terminate in the splenic vein. Its hsemorrhoidal branches inosculate with branches of the internal iliac vein, and thus establish a communication between the portal and general venous system. The superior mesenteric vein is formed by branches which collect the venous blood from the capillaries of the superior mesen- teric artery ; they constitute by their junction a large trunk, which ascends by the side of the corresponding artery, crosses the transverse portion of the duodenum, and unites behind the pancreas with the splenic in the formation of the portal vein.PORTAL SYSTEM. 472 The splenic vein couuneuces in the structure of the spleen, and quits that organ Ijy five or six large l)ranches, which soon unite to tonn a single trunk ; it is larger than the splenic artery, and perfectly straight in its course. It passes horizontally inwards behind the pancreas, and terminates near its greater end by uniting with the superior mesenteric and forming the portal vein.. It receives in its course the vasa brevia, left gastro-epiploic, pancreatico-duodenal, and Fto. 284.â€”The portal vein. i.

Those along the lesser curvature are, however, difFer- ently arranged to the artei'ies ; they are two in numlier, and receivePULMONARY VEINS. 473 the name of coronary veins. Of these the one placed most ante- riorly is the smallest: it runs from the cardiac towards the pyloric end of the curve, receives branches from the pylorus and upper part of the duodenum, and ends in the portal vein. The posterior branch, mucli the largest, runs from the pyloric towards the cardiac end, and at about an inch and a half from the oesophagus winds to the posterior surface of the stomach, crosses the splenic artery, and terminates in the portal vein above the preceding. The PORTAL VEIN (venaporta), formed l)y the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins iDehind the pancreas, ascends through the right border of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, one for each lateral lobe. In the right border of the lesser omentum it is situated behind and between the hepatic artery and ductus communis choledochus, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and lymphatics. At the transverse fissure each primary branch divides into numerous secondary branches which ramify through the portal canals, and give off vaginal and interlobular veins, and the latter terminate in the lobiilar venous plexus of the lobules of the liver. The portal vein within the liver receives the venous blood from the capillaries of the hepatic artery. Communications with the Systemic Veins.â€”The veins form- ing the portal system communicate with the systemic veinsâ€” (i) By the inosculation of the inferior htemorrhoidal tributaries of the inferior mesenteric with those of the internal iliac ; (2) by com- munications between the left renal vein and the veins of the intes- tines, especially those of the colon and duodenum ; and (3) by the inosculation of superficial branches of the portal veins of the liver with the phrenic veins. PULMONARY VEINS. The pulmonary veins, four in number, return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart; they differ from veins in general, in the area of their cylinders being less than that of the coi-responding arteries, in carrying arterial blood, in being devoid of valves, and in accompanying singly each branch of the pulmonary artery. They commence in the capillaries upon the parietes of the alveolar passages and air-cells, and unite to form a single trunk for each lobe. The vein of the middle lobe of the right lung unites with the superior vein, so as to form the two trunks which open into the left auricle. Sometimes they remain separate, and then there are three pulmonary veins on the right side. The right pul- monary veins pass behind the right auricle to the left auricle ; the left pass in front of the descending aorta ; they both pierce the pericardium. Within the lung the branches of the pulmonary veins are l)ehind the bronchial tubes, and those of the pulmonary' artery in front; but at the root of the lungs the veins are in front, next the arteries, and then the bronchi.474 LYMPHATICS. LYMPHATICS. Lymphatic vessels admit of a threefold division, into superficial, deep, and lacteals. The superficial li/mphatic vessels, on the surface of the body, follow the course of the veins, and pierce the deep fascia in convenient situations, to join the deep lymphatics. On the surface of organs they converge to the nearest lymphatic trunks. The superficial lymphatic glands are placed in the most protected situations of the superficial fascia, as in the hollow of the ham and groin in the lower extremity ; on the inner side of the arm in the upper extremity. The deep lymphatics, fewer in number and somewhat larger than the superficial vessels, accompany the deeper veins ; those from the lower parts of the body converging to the numerous glands seated around the iliac veins and inferior vena cava, and terminating in a large trunk situated on the vertebral column, the thoracic duct. From the upper part of the trunk of the body on the left side, and from the left side of the head and neck, they also proceed to the thoracic duct. Those on the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, and right side of the thorax, form a distinct duct which terminates at the point of junction of the subclavian with the internal jugular vein on the right side of the root of the neck. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestines ; they have received their distinctive appellation from conveying the milk-like product of digestion, the chyle, to the great centre of the lymphatic system, the thoracic duct. They are situated in the niesentery, and open into the numerous mesenteric glands in their course. When digestion is not proceeding they carry transparent lymph, like the other lymphatics. The lymphatic vessels and glands will be described according to the arrangement adopted for the veins, commencing with those of the head and neck, and proceeding next to those of the upper extremity, lower extremity, and trunk. LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Glands.â€”The superficial lymphatic glands of the head and face are small, few in number, and isolated ; they areâ€”the occipital, which are situated near the origin of the occipito-frontalis muscle ; posterior auricular, behind the ear ; parotid, on the parotid gland ; zygomatic, in the zygomatic fossa ; buccal, on the buccinator muscle, and submaxillary, beneath the margin of the lower jaw. There are no deep lymphatic glands within the cranium. The superficial cervical lymphatic glands are few in number and small; they are situated in the course of the external jugular vein, between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscle, at the root of the neck, and about the larynx.LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 475 The deep cervical glands (glandulse concateiiatse) are numerous and of large size ; they are situated around tlie internal jugular vein and sheath of the carotid artery, by the side of the pharynx, ceso- ])hagus, and trachea, and extend from the base of the skull to the root of the neck, where they are in communication with the lym- phatic vessels and glands of the thorax. Vessels.â€”The superficial lymphatic vessels of the head and face are disposed in three groups : occipital, which take the course of the occipital vein to the occi- pital and deep cervical glands ; teviporal, which follow the branches of the temporal vein to the parotid and deep cer- vical glands ; and facial, which accompany the facial vein to the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatic vessels of the head are the meningeal and cerebral J the former are situated in comiection with the meningeal veins, and escape through foramina at the base of the skull, to join the deep cer- vical glands. The chief cerebral lymphatics are situated on the surface of the pia mater and in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles. They pass along with the internal carotid and verte- bral arteries and the internal jugular vein through the fora- mina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cer- vical glands. In the substance of the brain the lymphatic capil- laries form perivascular spaces or cancels around all the blood-A-essels even to their smallest ramifications, and are in communication with similar spaces in the pia mater, and Avith the sub-arachnoid .space. The deep lymphatic vessels of the face proceed from the nasal fossEe, mouth, orbits, temporal fossae, and pharynx, and terminate in the submaxillary and deep cervical glands. The superficial and deep cervical lymphatic vessels accom- pany the jugular veins, passing from gland to gland ; at the root of - the neck they communicate with the thoracic lymphatic vessels, and terminate, on the right side, in the ductus lymphaticus dexter ; on the left, in the thoracic duct, near its termination.

One or tw(j arc .situated near tlie median l)asilic and median cejihalic vein, at the l)end of the elhow ; and one ov two near the basilic vein, on the inner side of the upper arm, imme- diately above the ell)ow. The deep glands in the forearm are excessively small and infrequent; two or three may he found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels. In the uj)per arm there is a chain of small glands, accompanying the brachial artery. The axillary glands are nume- rous and of large size. Some are closely adherent to the vessels, others are dispersed in the loose areolar tissue of the axilla, and a small chain may be observed extending along the lower border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland, recei^dng the lymphatics of that organ and of the front of theche&twall{pectoralglands). A similar chain is found along the subscapular vessels at the back of the axilla ; it receives the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the l)ack (subscapular glands). Two or three subclavian glands are situated beneath the clavicle, and ser\"e as the niedium of communication between the axillary and deep cervical lym- lihatic glands(i7ifra-claviculargla7ids). Vesskls.â€”The superficial lym- phatic vessels of the upper extre- mity commence on the fingers and take their course along the forearm to the bend of the elbow. The greater part reach their destination bypassing along the dorsal surface of the fingers, wrist, and forearm, and then curving around the borders of the latter ; but some few are met with in the palm of the hand, which take the At the bend of the elbow the lym-477 LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. l)liatics arrange themselves into two groups : an internal and larger group, wliich communicates with a gland situated just above the inner condyle, and then accompanies the basilic vein upwards to the axilla to enter the axillary glands ; and a smaller group which follows the course of the cephalic vein. Several of the vessels of this group cross the Inceps muscle at its upper part to reach the axillary glands, while the remainder, two or three in number, ascend with the cephalic vein in the interspace of the deltoid and pectoralis major ; these latter usually join a small gland in this space and then cross the pectoralis minor muscle to become continuous with the subclaAdan lymphatics. Besides the lymphatic vessels of the arm, tlie axillary glands receive those from the integument of the chest, its anterior, pos- terior, and lateral aspect, and the lymphatics of the mammary gland. The deep lymphatics accompany the vessels of the upper extre- mity, and communicate occasionally with the superficial lymi^hatics. They enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and, at the root of the neck, terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Glands.â€”The superficial lymphatic glands of the lower extre- mity are those of the groin, inguinal; and one or two situated in the superficial fascia of the posterior aspect of the thigh, just above the popliteal region. The inguinal glands are divisible into two groups : a superior group of small size, situated along the line of Poupart's ligament, and receiving the lymphatic vessels from the parietes of the abdomen, gluteal region, perineum, and genital organs ; and an inferior grouj^, called femoral glands, of larger size clustered around the internal saphena vein near its termination, and receiving the superficial lym- phatic vessels from the lower extremity. The deep lymphatic glands are the anterior tibial, popliteal^ deep inguinal, gluteal, and ischiaiic. Tlie anterior tibial is generally a single gland, placed on the interosseous membrane, by the side of the anterior tibial arteiy in the upper part of its course. The popliteal glands, four or five in number, and small, are embedded in the loose areolar tissue and fat of the popliteal space. The deep inguinal glands, less numerous and smaller than the superficial, are situated near the femoral vessels in the groin, beneath the fascia lata ; they communicate with the superficial lymphatics through the saphenous opening. The gluteal and ischiatic glands are placed near the vessels of that name, above and below the pyriformis muscle at the great ischiatic foramen.478 LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. y Vessels.â€”The superficial lymphatic vessels are divisible into two groupie, internal and external; the internal and principal group, commencing on the dor- sum and inner side of the foot, ascend the leg by the side of the internal sa- phena vein, and, passing behind the innei' condyle of the femur, follow the direc- tion of that vein to the groin, where they join the femoral group of super- ficial inguinal glands. The greater part of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia of the sa- l^henous ojDening and the sheath of the femoral vessels, to join the lymphatic gland situated in the crural ring, which serves to establish a communication be- tween the lymphatics of the lower extre- mity and those of the trunk. The other efferent vessels j)ierce the fascia lata to join the deep glands. The vessels which pass upwards from the outer side of the dorsum of the foot ascend along the outer side of the leg, and curve inwards across the front of the leg just below the knee, to unite with the lymphatics of the inner side of the thigh. The external group consists of a few lymjjhatic vessels which commence on the outer side of the foot and posterior part of the ankle, and accom- pany the external saphena vein to the popliteal region, where they enter the popliteal glands. The deep lymphatic vessels accom- pany the deep veins, and communicate Avith the various glands in their course. After joining the deep inguinal glands they pass beneath Poupart's ligament, to communicate with the numerous glands situated around the iliac vessels. The deep lymphatics of the gluteal region follow the course of the branches of the gluteal and iscliiatic veins. The former join the glands sitiuxted on the upjjer border of tlie pyriformis muscle, and the latter, after communicating with the lymphatics of the thigh, enter the iscliiatic glands. Tig. 287.â€”Superficial lymphatic vessels and glands of the front and inner side of the leg.I LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. 479 LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. The lymphatics of the trunk may be arranged under three heads, superficial, deep, and visceral. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper half of the trunk pass upwards and outwards at each side, and converge, some to the axillary glands, others to the glands at the root of the neck. The lymphatics from the mammary glands follow the lower border of the pectoralis major, communicating, by means of a chain of lymphatic glands, with the axillary glands. The superficial lym- phatic vessels of the lower half of the trunk, gluteal region, peri- neum, and external organs of generation, converge to the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. One or two small glands are situated at each side of the dorsal vein of the penis, near the suspen- sory ligament; from these, as from the superficial lymphatics, the efferent vessels pass into the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. Glands.â€”The deep lymphatic glands of the thorax are the intercostal, anterior mediastinal, and cesophageal. The intercostal glands, of small size, are situated on each side of the vertebral column, near the articulations of the lieads of the ribs, and in the course of the intercostal arteries. The anterior mediastinal glands are situated along the course of the internal mammary arteries ; they are six or seven in number at each side, and receive the lymphatic vessels from the anterior wall of the chest, the mediastinum, thymus gland, and pericardium. The oesophageal or posterior mediastinal glands, fifteen or twenty in number, are situated in the course of the cusojohagus, and receive the lymphatics of that tube ; they communicate above with the deep cervical glands, on each side with the intercostal, and belo^w Avith the abdominal glands. Vessels.â€”The deep lymphatic vessels of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammary, and diaphragmatic. The intercostal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins of the same name ; and reaching the vertebral column, curve down- wards, to terminate in the thoracic duct. The internal mammary lymphatics commence in the parietes of the abdomen communicating with the epigastric lymphatics. Tliey ascend by the side of the internal mammary vessels, being joined in their course by the anterior intercostals, and terminate at the root of the neck, on the right side in the tributaries of the ductus lympliaticus dexter; on the left, in the thoracic duct. The dia- 2)hmgmcdic lympliatics pursue the direction of their corresponding veins, and terminate, some in front, in the internal mammary vessels, and some behind in the postei'ior mediastinal lymithatics. Glands.â€”Tlie deep lymphatic glands of the abdomen are the lumbar glands : they are numerous, and seated around the common iliac vessels, the aorta, and vena cava. They receiA'e the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremities, pelvis, testicles and some of theLYMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. 486 abdominal viscera, and their eiferent vessels terminate in the re- ceptaculum chyli. The deep lymphatic glands of the pelvis are the external iliac, internal iliac, and sacral. The external iliac are placed ai'ound the external iliac vessels, being in continnation, by one extremity, with the femoral lymphatics; by the other, with the lumbar glands. The internal iliac glands are situated in the course of the inter- nal iliac vessels, and the sacral glands rest on the concave surface of tlie sacrum. Both sets of glands have efferent vessels which empty into the lumbal' chain of glands. Vessels.â€”The deep lymphatic vessels are continued upwards from the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament, and along the external iliac vessels to the lumbar glands, receiving in their cour.se the epi- gastric, circumflex iliac, and ilio-lumbar lymphatic vessels. Those from the parietes of the pelvis, and from the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac veins, and unite with the lumbar lymphatics. The lumbar lymphatic vessels, after receiving all the lymphatics from the lower extremities, pelvis, and loins, terminate by several large trunks in the receitta- culum chyli. LYMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. LUNGS.â€”The lymphatic vessels of the lungs, of large size, are distributed over every part of the surface, and through the texture of those organs. They are divisible into a superficial set which lies immediately beneath the pleura, and a deep set which accompanies the ramifications of the bronchial tubes, and jjulmonary arteries ; they converge to the bronchial glands, ten or twelve in num- ber, situated around the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs. Some of these glands, of small size, may be traced in connec- tion with the bronchial tubes into the substance of the lungs. The efferent vessels from the bronchial glands unite with those from the tracheal and esophageal glands, and terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct at the root of the neck, and on the right in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. The bronchial glands in the adult jDresent a variable tint of broAvn, and in old age a deep black colour. In infancy they have none of this pigment, and are not to be dis- tinguished from lymj)hatic glands in other situations. HEART.â€”The lymphatic vessels of the heart originate in the subserous areolar tissue of the surface, and in the deeper tissues of that organ, and follow the course of the coronary vessels, princi]3ally, along the right border of the heart to the glands situated around the arch of the aorta, and to the bronchial glands, whence they proceed to the root of the neck, and terininate in the thoracic duct. The cardiac glands are three or four in number. The pericardiac and thymic lymphatic vessels proceed to join the anterior mediastinal and bronchial glands.LYMPHATICS OF THE VISOEEA. 2 II LIVER.â€”The lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into deep and superficial. The former take their course through the portal canals, and through the right border of the lesser omentum, to the lymphatic glands situated in the course of the hepatic artery and along the lesser curve of the stomach. The superficial lym- phatics are situated in the areolar structure of the proper capsule, over the whole surface of the liver. The lymphatics of the convex surface are divided into two sets :â€”i. Those which pass from before backwards ; 2. Those which advance from behind forwards. The former unite to form trunks, which enter between the folds of the lateral ligaments at the right and left extremities of the organ, and of the coronary ligament in the middle. Some of these pierce the diaphragm and join the posterior mediastinal glands ; others con- verge to the lymphatic glands situated around the inferior cava. Those which pass from behind forwards consist of two groups : one ascends between the folds of the broad ligament, and perforates the diaphragm, to join the anterior mediastinal glands, finally emptying their contents into the ductus lymphaticus dexter ; the other curves around the anterior margin of the liver to its concave surface, and from thence to the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum. The lymphatic vessels of the concave surface are variously distri- buted, according to tlieir position; those from the right lobe ter- minate in the lumbar glands ; those from the gall-bladder, which are large, and form a remarkable plexus, enter the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum; and those from the left lobe con- verge to the lymphatic glands situated along the lesser curve of the stomach. SPLEEN AND PANCREAS.-The lymphatic glands of the spleen are situated around its hilum, and those of the pancreas in the course of the splenic vein. The hjmphatic vessels of these organs consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; they pass through their respective glands, and join the aortic glands previously to terminat- ing in the thoracic duct. STOMACH.~The lymphatic glands of the stomach, of small size, are situated along the lesser and greater curve of that organ. The lymphatic vessels, as in other viscera, are superficial and deep, the former originating in the subserous, the latter in the submucous tissue; they pass from the stomach in four different directions : some ascend to the glands situated along the lesser curve ; others descend to those occupying the greater curve ; a third set pass out- wards to the splenic glands, and a fourth to the glands situated near the pylorus and to the aortic glands. INTESTINES.â€”The lymphatic glands of the small intestine are situated between the layers of the mesentery, in the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric artery, and are thence named mesenteric glands. These glands are most numerous and largest superiorly, near the duodenum ; and, inferiorly, near the termina- .tion of the ileum. The lymphatic vessels of the small intestines are of two kinds :482 LYMPHATICS OF 'J'HE PELVIS. those of the stiaictuve of the intestine, wliicli run in the muscular coat between the longitudinal and circular fibres, and also beneath the peritoneum, previously to entering the mesenteric glands; and those which commence in the villi, in the substance of the mucous membrane, and are named lacteals. The lacteals commence in the centre of each villus, as a caecal tubulus, which opens into a fine network, situated in the submucous tissue. From this network the lacteal vessels proceed to the mesen- teric glands, and from thence to the thoracic duct, in which they terminate. The lymphatic glands of the large intestines are situated along the attached margin of the intestine, in the meshes formed by the colic and hsemorrhoidal arteries previoiLsly to their dis- tribution. The lymphatic vessels take their course in two different directions ; those of the caecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon, after traversing their proper glands, proceed to the mesen- teric glands, and those of the descending colon and rectum to the lumbar glands. KIDNEY.â€”The lymphatic vessels of the kidney follow the direction of the blood-vessels to the lumbar glands situated around the aorta and inferior vena cava ; those of the supra-renal capsules, which are very large and numerous, terminate in the renal lym- phatics. PELVIS.â€”The lymphatic vessels of the bladder are most numerous at the base and on the posterior aspect of that organ; they communicate with the lymphatics of the vesiculae seminales and prostate, and terminate in the internal iliac glands. The lymphatics of the uterus consist of a superficial and deep set; the former being placed beneath the peritoneum, and the latter in the substance of the organ. Those of the cer\'ix and vagina join the internal iliac and sacral glands; those of the body and fundus enter the broad ligaments, and after receiving the lymphatics of the ovaries, broad ligaments, and Fallopian tubes, terminate in the lumbar glands. The lymphatic vessels of the testicle take the course of the spermatic cord, in which they are of large size; they terminate in the lumbar glands. THORACIC DUCT. The thoracic duct, the great trunk of the lymphatic and chylous system, commences in the abdomen by a considerable and somewhat triangular dilatation, the receptaculum chyli, which is situated on the front of the body of the second lumlmr vertebra, behind and between the aorta and inferior vena cava, and close to the tendon of the right crus of the diaphragm. From the upper part of the receptaculum chyli the thoracic duct ascends through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and along the front of the vertebral column, lying between the thoracic aorta and vena azygos and upon the T'ight intercostal arteries, to the fourth dorsal vertebra. It then483 THOEACIC DUCT. inclines to the left side, passes behind the arch of the aorta, and iscends by the side of the oesophagus, and behind the perpendicular portion of the left subclavian artery to the root of the neck opposite the seventh cervical vertebra, where it makes a sudden curve for- ivards and downwards in front of the scalenus anticus muscle, and Fig. 288.â€”The course and termination of the thoracic duct. 1.

The thoracic - duct is about eighteen or twenty inches in length, and near its origin as large as a goose quill; as it ascends, it diminishes in size, and near its termination again becomes dilated. At the middle of tlie thorax it frequently divides into two branches of equal size, which reunite after a short course ; and sometimes it gives off several branches, which assume a plexiform arrangementTHORACIC DUCT. 484 in this situation. Occasionally the thoracic duct bifurcates at the upper part of the thorax into two branches, one of whicli operiB into tlie point of junction between the right subclavian and jugular vein, while the other proceeds to the normal termination of the duct on the left side. The thoracic duct presents fewer valves in its course than lym- phatic vessels generally ; at its termination it is provided with a pair of semilunar valves, to prevent the admission of venous Ijlood. Branches.â€” i'he thoracic duct receives at its commencement foui' or five large lymphatic trunks, which unite to form the receptaculuiu chyli ; it next receives the trunks of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax it is joined by the lymphatic vessels from the left half of the thoracic wall, those of the sternal and intercostal glands, those of the left lung, left side of the heart, trachea, and tt'sophagus, and as it curves forwards in the neck it is joined Ijy lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, and left uj^per extremity. The ductus lymphaticus dexter is a short trunk which receives the lymphatic vessels from the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, right lung, and one or two branches from the iipper convex surface of the liver. It terminates at the junction of the right subclavian with the right internal jugular vein, at the point where these veins unite to form the right innominate vein ; and is provided at its termination with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the entrance of blood from the veins.PART VI. NEUROLOGY. The nervous system consists of large masses of nerve matter forming the cerebro-spinal axis, of lesser centres called ganglia, of the peri- pheral nerves, and, lastly, of certain modifications of the latter constituting the organs of sense. THE CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. The mass of nerve matter forming the cerebro-spinal axis is con- tained in the cavity of the cranium and vertebral canal; it is divided into two partsâ€”the encephalon or brain and the spinal cord ; each lateral half of these centres corresponds accurately with the other half, the two parts being joined together by connecting bands of nerve tissue called commissures. The brain, contained in the cranium, and the spinal cord occupying the vertebral canal, are (protected by the osseous walls of those cavities, and are also sur- ; rounded by meninges or membranes which support them and 1 convey to their substance the vessels necessary for their nutrition. ] The great centres of the cerebro-spinal nervous system are most i easily u.nderstood by taking them up in the following order : spinal ) cord, medulla oblongata, jjons Varolii, cerebrum, and cerebellum. SPINAL CORD. The spinal cord of the adult, from fifteen to eighteen inches in : length, extends from the foramen magmim to opposite the lowej- border of the body of the first or upper border of the second lumbar : vertebra, where it tapers to a conical point {conus medullaris), ; from which is continued downwards a slender cord, the Jilum i terminale. In the child, at birth, the cone reaches the middle of the third lumbar vertebra, and in the embryo is prolonged as far as the (lower part of the sacral canal. When stripped of its membranes and nerves the cord weighs from i oz. to if oz. ; its proportion to the weight of the encephalon is as i to 33. The cord presents a lifFerence of diameter in different parts of its extent, and has two 485 I486 SPINAL CORD. enlargements. The uppermost of these corresponds with the origin of the nerves destined to the upper extremities (cervical) ; and the lower enlargement (hombar) is situated near the termination of thu cord, and corres^jonds with the attachment of the nerves intended for the supply of the lower limbs. Tlie cervical enlargement is widest in the transverse diameter, and extends from the thii-d cervical vertebra to the first dorsal; corresponding, therefore, to the origin of the nerves of the brachial plexus. The lumbar enlarge- ment is widest from before backwards ; it corresponds to the origin of the lumbar and sacral :ierves, and extends from the tenth dorsal vertebra to the upper part of the conns meduUaris. The spinal cord gives off near its termination an assemblage of nerves Avhicli has received the name of cauda equina; the cauda ecLuina 1;^ formed by the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves elongated by the growth of the spine, the ganglia of the posterior roots being held in connection "with the intervertebral foramina through which the nerves pass. The spinal cord is held in its place by its connection above -witl: the medulla oljlongata at the foramen magnum, and below by the attachment of the filum terminale to the base of the coccyx ; laterally it is secured by a membrane, the ligamentum clentatum, which jjasses from its lateral aspect to join the dura mater, and by the spinal nerves which are fixed to the membranes and bones at the inter- A^ertebral foramina. It is much smaller than the canal in which it lies, being separated from the osseous walls by its membranes, by venous plexuses and areolar tissue. In form, the spinal cord is a fiattened cylinder, and presents on it> anterior surface a fissure, which extends into the cord to the dei)tli of one-third its diametei', and is occupied by a fold of pia mater. This is the anterior median fissure. If the sides of this fissure be gently separated, they will be seen to be connected at the bottom by a layer of white substance, the anterior white commissure. In the middle line behind and corresponding with the anterior fissure is the posterior median fissure, which contains a few blood- vessels and a little connective tissue {neuroglia). It extends nior-' deeply into the cord than the anterior fissure, and reaches the gre\ substance of the interior forming the posterior grey commissure. These two fissures divide the spinal cord into two lateral portions, â–  which are connected to each other by the white commissure whicli forms the bottom of the anterior fissure, and by a mass of grey matter situated behind it. A little external to the posterior median fissure on each side is a slight Hne, the posterior intermediate septum, Avhich marks the limits of the posterior niedian columns. These columns are most apparent in the cervical i-egion, and beconn- continuous in the medulla oblongata, with the posterior pyranuds, or funiculi graciles. , On the lateral aspects of the cord two other lines are observed, the anterior and posterior lateral grooves, corresponding with the attachment of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves.SPINAL COED. 487 The anterior lateral groove is a mere trace, marked only by the attachment of the filaments of the anterior roots ; the posterior lateral groove is somewhat more evident. These fissures and grooves divide the cord into columns, those of the two sides accurately corresponding, and receiving the same names. The column between the anterior median fissure and anterior nerve roots is called the anterior column ; that between the anterior and posterior nerve roots, the lateral column,â€”the two together being often spoken of as the antero-lateral column. Between the posterior median fissure and the posterior nerve roots is the posterior column, which is again di\dded by the posterior intermediate septum into a postero-internal column (Column of Goll) and a postero-external (Golumn of Burdach). Internal Structure.â€”If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, its internal structure may be seen and examined. It will then appear to be com- posed of two hollow cylin- â€”^ ders of white substance ^ ' ^' placed side by side, and connected by a narrow ivhite commissure. Each cylinder is filled with grey substance, which is con- nected by a commissure of the same matter {grey commissure). The grey matter is both relatively and absolutely the greatest in quantity in the lumbar portion of the cord ; the white matter is relatively the greatest in amount in the dorsal region, and ab- solutely greatest in the cervical region. The form of the grey substance, as observed in the section, is that of two irregularly curved or crescentic lines joined by a transverse band. The extremities of the curved lines cor- responding witli the sulci of origin of the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves are termed 1"JG. 289.â€”Transverse section of half the spinal cord.

The back part of the posterior horn is enlarged, and is calledSPINAL CORD. 488 the caput cornu loosterioris, the constricted portion behind this being distinguished as the cervix cornu. At the tip of the caput cornu the grey matter has a semi-transparent appearance, and was called by Rolando the substantia cinerea gelatinosa. Filum Terminale.â€”This is a fine thread which passes dowTi from the conical end of the cord to be attached to the lower part of the sacral canal or base of the coccyx ; in its course downwards it lies in the middle of the nerves forming the cauda equina. For about half its length it contains nervous elements continued into it from the cord, contained in a sheath of pia mater, the latter forming the chief portion of the thread, and being the means by which the cord is held in place. At the lower j)art of the vertebral canal it is attached to the dura mater and wall of the canal. Central Canal.â€”In the centre of the grey matter of the cord there is a minute canal lined by columnar epithelium, which extends upwards into the fourth ventricle, and downwards into the filum ter- minale. It is cylindrical or elliptical in shape in the upper part of the cord, but widens as it descends, and at the lower part is T-shaped; it is not unusual to find it filled u]3 with epithelial debris. The epithelium lining the canal is ciliated in the child, but there is no reason to believe that it is so in the adult. Minute Structure of the Spinal Cord.â€”The pia mater closely in- vests the spinal cord, and sends a process into the anterior median fis- sure, which conveys blood-vessels for the interior of the cord. Beneath it, and not usually distinctly separable from its strvictixre, is a cover- ing of connective tissu.e, from which j)rocesses pass into the white matter of the cord so as to form partial septa between its several parts. The whole of the grey and white matter is traversed by the peculiar form of connective tissue already described under the title of Neuroglia (p. 37). This is especially plentiful around the central canal and in the caput cornu posterioris; in the latter situation it constitutes the chief part of the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando. The neuroglia of the cord is composed of (i) a network of very fine fibrils resembling elastic tissue, (2) a fine granular or homogeneous matrix in which the fibres are embedded, and (3) smaU cells consisting of a nucleus and small cell-body, placed at the inter- sections of the fibres {glia cells, cells of Deiters). Neuroglia differs from all other forms of connective tissue in being of epiplastic origin, and in being composed of a peculiar material called 7i-ettro-A;eraii//. which resembles horn or hair. The outer or white part of the cord consists of medullated nerve- fibres lying in the meshes of the neuroglia ; they rvin, for the most part, longitudinally, and are devoid of primitive sheath and nodes of Ranvier. Sections stained with carmine show the axis-cylinder Avithin each fibre, but seldom exactly in the centre, and the fibres are seen to vary considerably in size, the largest ones measuring inch, and the smallest inch. The inner or grey portion of the cord is composed of nerve-cells and grey or non-medullated nerve-fibres, supported by neuroglia.SPINAL COED. 489 Most of the cells are stellate or multipolar, but they vary greatly in their size and arrangement; they have no distinct sheath, possess a large nucleus and one or more nucleoli, and contain an intercellular and internuclear network. The outer edge of each grey crescent is very irregular, especially at the root of the anterior horn, where the margin is broken up by neuroglia fibres into a network, the meshes of which contain nerve-fibres ; this is called the lateral reticular fwmation. In the upper dorsal region the grey matter forms a j)ro- jection into the lateral white column opposite the grey commis- sure, sometimes described as the lateral horn. The nerve-cells are largest in the anterior cornu, where they are chiefly gathered into two groups, called the antero-internal group and the antero-external group. Another collection of somewhat smaller cells is, found in the dorsal region of the cord in the lateral extension of the J i iG. 290 -Diagi-am of the tracts of the spmal cord. i.

Experiments on animals, and observation of areas of degeneration after disease or injury in man, have, however, demon- strated that physiologically the columns or tracts are more nume- rous than this, and the following, briefly stated, are those generally recognised :â€”The inner portion of the anterioi' column bordering on the anterior median fissuie is known as the direct ^niraniidal tract or column of Tiirck (Fig. 290, 10) ; the rest of the anterior column is called the anterior root zone or hods bundle (11). On the surface of the lateral part of the cord, extend- ing forwards from the posterioi- nerve roots, is a thin bundle of fibres called the direct lateral cerebellar tract (15), and beneath this a thicker mass of fibres, the crossed pyramidal tract (13), between which and the grey matter is a thin layer called the lateral limiting layer ^ close to the lateral J'-^'J reticular formation (16) ; the rest of the lateral column is called the mixed zone, but this has been again diWded into the deep part or anterior (jround fibres (i2)j and the superficial part, the antero - lateral sen- sory tract (14). The posterior column1 ^ ah'eady described, is div'ided into the postero-external or column of Bur- dach (17), and the postero - internal or column of Goll (18).

By following the fibres i, 2, 3, Aic, their coiirse tb rough the grey matter of the spinal cord may be traced. their connection with the nerve centre is here noted. The anterior roots pass through the substance of the whiteMEDULLA OBLONGATA. matter into the grey matter of the anterior cornu, which they enter in several bundles. Their fibres maybe traced to (i) the antero- external grovip of cells, (2) the lateral white cohimns, (3) the posterior cornu, (4) the anterior part of the commissure, and (5) the antero-internal grouj) of cells (J. E. Whitaker). The posterior roots enter the cord in two distinct bundlesâ€” external and internal. The fibres of the outer bundle can be traced to (i) the nerve-cells of theâ–  posterior horn, (2) the anterior horn, and (3) the posterior part of the commissure. The fibres of the inner bundle do not pass directly into the grey matter, but enter the white substance of the postero-external column, and from thence pass into the grey centre ; they have been traced to (i) the antero- external cells of the anterior horn, (2) the cells of the posterior vesicular column, and (3) the posterior part of the commissure (J. E. Whitaker). THE ENCEPHALON. The encej)halon, or that j)art of the cerebro-spinal centre contained within the cranium, consists of the medulla oblongata, pons Varolii, cerebrum, and cerebellum. The whole mass weighs on an average about fifty ounces for the male, and forty-four and a half for tlie female. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata is the upper enlarged portion of the spinal cord. It is oblique in its position, its upper surface looking upwards and backwards, and its lower downwards and forwards ; the former constitutes the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, the latter lies on the basilar portion of the occipital bone. Its upper or posterior part is lodged in the vallecula of the cerebellum. It is somewhat conical in shape, and a little more than an inch in length, extending from the pons Varolii to a point corresponding with the upper border of the atlas. The anterior and posterior median fissures of the cord are continued into the medulla, and the former terminates at the lower edge of the pons in a smaU recess called the foramen ccecum of Vicq d'Azyr. The posterior fissure expands about tlie middle of the medulla into a diamond-shaped cavity, the fourth ventricle, the presence of which causes the back of the medulla to be flattened. The anterior median fissure is interrupted at its lower part by the crossing of nerve-filjres between the two halves of the medulla, this being known as the decussation of the pyramids; this inter- change consists m the mass of fibres from the lateral column ot the one side passing to the anterior pyramid of the other side {crossed pyramidal tract). The upper part of the meduUa on its anterior aspect is distin- guished by an oval prominence at each side called the olivary body ; this is about half an inch in lengtli, and extends to the inferior border of the pons.MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 492 Bet^yâ€¢een the olivary body and the anterior median fissure iÂ« a pyramidal strand of white nerve matter called the anterior pyra- mid ; it forms a rounded projection into which tlie fibres from the decussation of the pyramids pass, and is marked by a con- stricting groove at its connection with tlie pons. The outer part of each anterior pyramid is formed by fibres continued ujjwards fi'om the direct pyramidal trad of the same side of the spinal cord ; the inner and larger portion consists of .the fibres of the crossed 'pyra- midal tract of the opposite side of the cord, which, as already mentioned, enter it at the de- cussation. Behind the olivary body a narrow white nerve strand will be observed,â€”this is the oli- vary fasciculus or fillet; it is derived from the mixed zone of the lateral column of the cord, and will be traced to the corpora tpiadrigemina and optic thalamus. Curving round the lowei end of the olive are the ex- ternal arciform or arcuate fibres. They issue from the anterior median fissure, cross the anterior pyramids, skill the lower end of the filivar}- body, and being joined liy the lateral cerebellar tract ot the cord, forni the restiform body. The groove between the olive and anterior jjyramid is continuous with the slight marking on the cord at the origin of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves ; here, however, it is a more distinct furrow, and lodges the two bundles of root fibres of the hypoglossal nerve. At the back of the olive and its fasci- culus is another groove, continuous with the posterior lateral sulcus of the cord, and giving origin from above downwards to the glosso- pharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves. At the back part of the medulla and bordering on the posterior fissure is a narrow strand of fibres, already described in the spinal cord as the postero-internal strand or column of Goll; here it is Fig. 293 Front view of the upper part of the cranio-spinal axis, with tlie origins of the nerves, m.

The upper extremity is enlarged and somewhat club-shaped, and hence is called the clava. ^^-^^^ what wedge- Â« " I"'Â» .shaped ; tliis column is called the funiculus cuneatus, and its upper enlarged end is termed the cuneate tubercle. It is the upward extension of the j)ostero-external column of the cord, or column of Burdach, and its tubercle contains a grey nucleus {nucleus cuneaUis) in which many of the fibres of the column seem to terminate. Still farther out is a longitudinal prominence, which, becoming broader as it ascends, forms a definite eminence, the tubercle of Rolando, the ridge itself being called the funiculus of Rolando. This strand is not continuous with the white matter of the cord ; it consists mainly of a mass of grey matter (nucleus of Rolando), which is the representative in the medulla of the caput cornu, posterioris of the cord. Between the funiculus of Rolando and the olive we notice the external arciforvi fibres above described ; they are reinforced by a band of fibres derived from the lateral column of the cord and forming the direct cerebellar tract. These strands unite to form the restiform tract, which, crossing the upper part of the funiculus of Rolando and funiculus cuneatus, in part blends with those tracts, and is thence continued upwards to the crus cerebelli, so as to form the inferior peduncle of the cerebellum {processus ad meclullam). Internal Structure of the Medulla Oblongata.â€”The internal â€¢structure is best demonstrated by cross-sections made at difterent levels ; in such specimens the medulla is seen to be composed of The posterior py- ramid forms the lateral boundary of the lower end of the fourth ven- tricle ; the fibres contained in it and derived from the posterior median column of the cord appear to be con- nected with a grey nucleus in the clava {nucleus clavatus). External to the funiculus gracilis is a less-defined strand, which as it ascends also widens out, so as to become some- 3 Fig. 294.â€”Medulla and pons from behind. f.g. Funiculus gra- cilis, cl.

If the section be made through the upper part of the decussation the appearance presented will be such as is shown in Fig, 295. In from and behind are the anterior and pontcrior median fissures {a.m.f. and p.m.f.); at the bottom of the anterior fissure is the decussation, proceed- ing from which a narrow band of fibres will be observed running outwards, forming the dee}) arciform tract (f-o^.). Behind the decassa- tion is the central canal surrounded by grey matter. In the front of the medulla, and bordering on the anterior fissure, is a large triangular mass of white matter, the anterior mraviid, on the surface of whiclj are the superficial arciform fibres (f.a.), and near its outer border Fig. 295.â€”Section of the medulla at the level of the decussation of the pyramids, a.m.f.

Between the nucleu,s lateralis and the decussation is a long grey mass, the internal accessory olivary nucleus (o\), and outside there is an irregular nucleus (0.), which is the lower extremity of the corpus dentatum of the olive. At the back of the medulla is a large nucleus, the nucleus gracilis (n.g.), causing the projection of the cla\ .i oi funiculis gracilis (fg.), as already described ; external to this another large mass, the cuneate nucleus (n.c), lies in the deep part ot the funiculus cuneatus (f.c), a secondary smaller deposit near the sur- face of that column being called the external cuneate nucleus {n.c^.}.495 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Behind the lateral nucleus is the greij tubercle of Rolando (g.), the upper expansion of the caput cornu posterioris, and on the sur- face of this a Avhite concave band, the ascending sensory root of the fifth ne)-ve (a.v.). In front of the latter a few fibres derived from the formatio reticularis wall be noticed {f.aP) ; they join the arciform fibres at the lower margin of the olive. If we now examine a section through the middle of the olivary body we shall find that important changes have taken place in the arrangement of j)arts. The central canal has disaj^peared, and the centre of the medulla is occupied by a raphe', composed of non- medullated fibres and multipolar cells ; it extends from the anterior median fissure to beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle.

Both the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando and the nucleus lateralis are present, but are much less distinct than in the previous section. In- ternal to the nucleus gracilis and a little anterior is a round bundle of white fibres, called the funiculus solitarius {f.s.) ; it is by some supposed to be the root of the phrenic nerve in the medulla. The course taken by the different nerve strands in passing through the medulla will be traced after the cerebrum and cerebellum have been described. PONS VAROLII. The pons Varolii (tuber annulare) is a convex arch of white matter situated above the medulla, and forming on each side a slightly constricted strand where it enters each lateral half of the cerebellum, and constitutes the middle peduncle of the crus cerebelli (processus ad pontem). Its upper border lies across the commencement of the crura cerebri, and its lower is marked off from the medulla by a deep groove; in the middle line it has a slight depression, which lodges the basilar artery. From its lateral aspect issue the two roots of the fifth nerve. The posterior sur- face of the pons is iU- defined ; it is flattened from before backwards, and forms the upper part of the floor of the fourtli ventricle. In longitudinal verti- cal section (Fig. 306, 26) it is seen that the sujoer- ficial transverse fibres form a moderately thick layer, and that beneath them is a band of ascend- ing fibres continued up- wards from the anterior po.

Sec-BASE OF THE BRAIN. 497 the pons it is necessary to study a transverse section, such as that shown in Fig. 297. The superficial transverse fibres (po-.) are separated from the deep (po.^) by the mass of ascending fibres from the anterior pyramid (py.). Near the middle of the section is a large collection of the deep transverse fibres, called the trapezium (t.) from the fact that in certain lower animals it assumes the appearance of an irregular four-sided figure. Behind the trapezium is a continua- tion of the formatio reticularis, already described in the sections of the medulla; in the middle line is an imperfect raphe formed of nerve-cells and non-meduUated fibres. At the back are the nuclei for the origin of the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves (indicated in the figure by Roman numerals), and nerve strands are seen proceeding from these and traversing the j)ons. The ascending root of the fifth nerve is seen cut across (a.v.), enclosed by a con- tinuation of the greij substance of Rolando; while a special nuclerxs (o.s.), called the superior olivary nucleus, is situated behind the lateral fibres of the trapezium. Some writers describe a small grey nucleus among the superficial transverse fibres, and name it the nucleus of the pons. CEREBRUM. The cerebrmn jDresents on its surface a number of slightly convex elevations, the convolutions (gyri), which are separated from each other by sulci of various depth. It is divided superiorly into two hemispheres by the great longitudinal fissure, which lodges the falx cerebri, and marks the original develoj)nient of the brain by two symmetrical halves. Base of the Brain. The student should first study the Ijase of the brain ; for this purpose the organ should be turned upon its upper surface. The arachnoid membrane, some parts of the pia mater, and the circle of Willis, must be carefully cleared away, in order to expose all the parts to be examined. These he will find to be as follows :â€” Longitudinal fissure, Infundibulum ; Corpus callosum. Pituitary body, Lamina cinerea, Corpora albicantia, Olfactory nerves, Locus perforatus, Fissure of Sylvius, Crura cerebri; Substantia perforata ; Pons Varolii, Optic commissure, Crura cerebelli. Tuber cinereum, Medulla oblongata. The longitudinal fissure is the space separating the two hemi- spheres ; it is continued downwards to the base of the brain, and divides the two anterior lobes. In this fissure the anterior cerebral arteries ascend towards the corpus callosum ; and if the two lobes be slightly drawn asunder, the anterior border (genu) of the corpus 2 ICEREBRUM. 498 callosum will be seen descending to the base of the brain. Arrived at the base of the brain, the corpus callosum terminates by a concave border, which is prolonged to the commissure of the optic nerves by a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cmerea. The lamina cinerea is the anterior pai't of the inferior Ijoundary of the third ventricle.

On the under surface of each anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, is the olfactory nerve, with its bu.lb. The fissure of Sylvius bounds the frontal lobe posteriorly, and separates it from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe ; it lodges the middle cerebral artery. The substantia perforata (locus perforates anticus) is a triangu- lar surface coated with grey matter, situated at the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named perforata from being pierced by a number of openings for the medullary branches of the middle i499 BASE OF THE BRAIN. cerebral artery which enter the brain in this situation to supjily the grey substance of the cori^us striatum. The optic commissure is situated in the middle line ; it is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The tuber cinereum is an eminence of grey substance situated immediately behind the optic commissure, and in front of the cor- pora albicantia. From its centre there projects a small conical body of grey substance, apparently a prolongation of the tuber cinereum, the infundibulum. The infundibulum is hollow, enclosing a short ctecal canal, which communicates with the cavity of the third ventricle ; and, below the termination of the canal, the conical process becomes connected with the pituitai'y body. The infun- dibulum and tuber cinereum form jiart of the floor of the third ventricle. The pituitary body (hypojDhysis cerebri) is a small, flattened reddish-grey body, situated in the sella turcica, and closely retained in that situation by the dura mater and arachnoid. It consists of two lobes, closely j)ressfed together, the anterior lobe being the larger of the two and oblong in shape, the posterior roimd. Both lobes are connected witli the infundibulum, but the latter is so soft in texture as to be generally torn through in the removal of the brain. Indeed, for the purposes of the student, it is better to eftect this separation with the knife, and leave the pituitary body in situ, to be examined with the base of the cranium. The corpora albicantia (mammillaria, bulbi fornicis) are tw(Â» white convex bodies, having the shaj^e and size of peas, situated behind the tuber cinereum, and between the crura cerebri. They are a part of the anterior crura of the fornix, which, after their origin from the thalami optici, descend to the base of the brain, and making a sudden curve upon themselves jirevioiisly to their ascent to the lateral ventricles, constitute the corpora albicantia. When divided by section, these bodies will be found to be composed of a capsule of white substance, containing grey matter, the gi'ey matter of the two corpora being connected by means of a commissure. The locus perforatus posticus (jjons Tarini) is a layer of whitish- gi'ey substance, connected in front with the corpora albicantia, behind Avith the pons Varolii, and on each side with the crura cerebri, be- tween which it is situated. It is perforated by several thick tufts of arteries derived from the posterior cerebral which are distributed to the thalami optici and third venti'icle, of M-hich latter it assists in forming the flooi'. The crura cerebri (peduncles of the cerebrum) are two thick white cords, which issue from the anterior border of the pons Varolii, and di^-erge to enter the thalami optici and corpora striata. The third nerve will be observed to arise from the inner side of each crus, and the fourtli nerve winds ai-ound its outer border from above.

Tlie structures therein situated form tlie floor of the tliird ventricle ; they are the hunina cinerea, tuber cinereuni, infundilnilum, corpora albicantia, and locus jDerforatus posticus. Tlie pons Varolii has been already described. On its lateral aspect is the thick bundle of filaments belonging to the fifth nerve ; lying against its posterior border are the se\'enth and eighth pairs of ner^â€¢es, and between it and the anterior pyramid of the medulla the -â€¢^ixth nerve has its origin. The medulla oblongata is described at p. 491. Convolutions and Sulci. The cerebrum is divided into five lobes, which, although inti- mately connected with each other in their deeper parts, are sepa- I'ated on the surface by well-defined fissures or sulci ; they are the frontal, parietal, occipital, temporo-sphenoidal, and central. The fissures which form the boundaries of these lobes are three in numberâ€”the fissure of Sylvius, fissure of Rolando, and parieto- occipital fissure : these will be first descriljed, after which the dif- ferent lobes and the convohitions Avill be studied in detail. Fissure of Sylvius (Fig. 299, c, e).â€”This fissure has already l)een mentioned in connection Avith the structures at the base of the brain ; it consists of two portions, one of which (c) passes almost A'ertically upwards into the frontal lobe ; the other (e) is directed obliquely upwards and backwards, and serves to separate the parietal from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The group of convolutions placed l)etween the tAVO limljs of the fissure of Sylvius were collectively named l.)y Broca the opercuUim of the insula, but are better known as the lobe of Broca ; on turning them aside the central lobe or island of Reil is lii'ought into Aaew. Fissure of Rolando (Figs. 299 and 300, d).â€”Placed nearly in the centre of the outer surface of the cerebrum, this fissure is found to commence near the margin of the longitudinal fissure, and to run doATOAvards and forwards, to terminate a little l)eliind the bifurcation of the fi ssure of Syh'iiis. It divides the frontal from the parietal lobe, and is bounded througlumt its entii'e length l)y two convolu- tions, the one in front l)eing the ascending frontal, the one behind the ascending parietal. The chief motor areas of the cortex are situated in the convolutions bordering on this fissure. The parieto-occipital fissure is less distinctly marked than the two just descril)ed ; it is l^est seen on the inner surface of the hemi- sphere (Fig. 301, p o). It commences near the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, Avhere it is united with the calcarine fissure, and passing upAvards and l)ackwards appears on the margin of theCEREBRUM. 502 hemisphere in tlie longitudinal fissure ; it then runs for a short distance over the external convex surface of the cerebrum, and sepa- rates the parietal fi'oni the occipital lol)e. The extent to which tlii.s lissure may be traced in the latter direction varies greatly in different brains ; sometimes the fissure is a mere notch at the upper margin of the hemisphere, at other times it extends over a consideral^le pait of its surface. This diflerence depends on the presence and degree I >f development of the annectant convolutions. The frontal lobe (Figs. 299, 200, and 301, f) forms the antei'ior part of the brain, its under surface resting on the orlntal plate of tlu^ frontal bone ; it is separated from the parietal lol)e hy the fissure of Rolando, and from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe l)y the fissure of Sylvius. On the inner surface of the hemisphere the frontal lobe is not well defined, but is generally described as terminating at the upper limb of the calloso-marginal fissure. The frontal lobe is marked by five fissures, which are the boundaries of the convolutions oi which it is composed ; two of these called inferior and superior frontal sulci divide the greater portion of the lobe into three chief convolutions, called respectively the first, second, and tJiird, or infe- rior, middle, and suioerior frontal gyri (Fig. 299, i, 2, 3). A third fissure called precentral runs in front of and nearh'' parallel with the fissure of Rolando ; other fissures called olfactory and orbital are found on the under surface of the frontal lobe. The ascending frontal convolution (4) bounds the fissure of Rolando anteriorly, and is connected at each extremity of that fissure with the ascend- ing parietal convolution. The under surface of the frontal lobe rests upon the orbital j^late of the frontal bone, and the con- â€¢\'olutions are consequently named orbital; there are usually three distinguishable, called from their position inner, outer, and anterior orbital. Two fissures are here seen, one of wdiich is described as the orbital or triradiate sulcus; the other lodges the olfactory tract, and hence is known as the olfactory sulcus. The sulci and convolutions of the inner aspect of the frontal lobe will be de- scribed when that surface of the hemisphere is considered as a whole (p. 503). The parietal lobe (Figs. 299, 300, and ^,01, r) is separated in front from the frontal lobe hy the fissure of Rolando, below it is bounded by the posterior portion of the fissure of Sylvius, and behind by the parieto-occipital fissure. At the lower and liack part it is united with the temporo-sphenoidal and occipital lobes l)y the annectant convolutions. It is divided by a deep sulcus, which runs downwards and backwards near its centre and is called the inter- parietal fissure, into two chief convolutions, the upper called superior and the lower inferior parietal; the latter is further divided into two parts, one running along the upper border of the posterior part of the fissure of Sylvius and called supra-marginal convolution, the other called angular gyrus forming an irregular convolution which connects the temporo-sphenoidal and parietal lobes, and winds round the posterior end of the first temporo-sphenoidal or ]iarallelCONVOLUTIONS AND SULCI. fissure. The anterior border of the parietal lobe is formed by the ascending parietal convolution, which, as mentioned above, bounds the fissure of Eolando posteriorly. The occipital lobe (o), of small size, forms the posterior termina- tion of the cerebrum ; it is imperfectly limited above by the parieto- occipital fissure, but laterally and below is united with the parietal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes by annectant convolutions. It con- tains three ill-defined convolutions placed horizontally, and named first (lo), second (ii), and third (12) occipital gyri. The temporo-sphenoidal or temporal lobe (t) fills up the middle fossa of the skull, and is the deepest-seated portion of the cerebrum. It is separated from the frontal lobe and anterior part of the parietal lobe by the fissure of Sylvius, but is united to the occipital and parietal lobes posteriorly. It is marked by three fissures, the first of which lies immediately below the posterior part of the fissure of Sylvius, and as it runs in the same direction is named the parallel fissure; the other two are called the middle and inferior temporo- sphenoidal fissures. The chief convolutions are three in number, first {ov infra-marginal) (7), second (8), and third (9), temporo-sphenoidal gyri. Below these, on the under surface of the brain, are two temporo- occipital convolutions, the outer of which, being wider in the middle than at either end, is named the fusiform lobule; the inner one is named the lingual lobule, and is contimious at its posterior part with the hippocampal convolution. The central lobe or island of Reil (c) is situated in the fissure of Sylvius, being co^^ered by the convolutions of the frontal, parietal, and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, more especially the lower end of as- cending j)arietal and ascending frontal, and the posterior extremity of the inferior frontal convolution, these together constituting the opercidum. It corresponds in position to the outer surface of the corpus striatum, as may be well seen in a vertical transverse section of the brain (see Fig. 314). It is divided into four or five small con- volutions {gyri operti) which radiate from the centre of its posterior l)order, the sulci between which lodge the di^dsions of the middle cerebral artery. The sulci which separate the central lobe from the rest of the hemisphere are known as the anterior, posterior, and external fissures of Reil. The annectant convolutions are four in number ; the first (a) joins the parietal to the upper part of the occipital lobe, the second 0) connects the angular gyrus of the parietal with the first con- volution of the occipital lobe, and the third (y) and fourth (8) connect the second and third temporal convolutions witlx the occi- pital lobe. The Inner Surface of the Hemisphere. By slicing off one hemisphere to the level of the corpus callosum, a side view of the opposite hemisphere will be obtained, but to com- plete the study of the inner surface of the hemisphere a complete vertical section of a hardened brain sliould be referred to.CEREBRUM. 504 The inner surface of the hemisphere (Fig. 301) at its anterior part ]3resent.s two large convolutioiiR, tlie iipper, the marginal convolutim (i) (convolution of longitudinal lissure), and the lower, the convolu- tion of the mjms callosum (2) or (jijrus fornicatus, separated by the calloso-marginaL fissure (cm) which i'eaches the margin of the hemi- sphere, a little ])osterior to the position of the fissure of Rolando, and bounds the marginal convolution Ijehind. The marginal convolution (i) commences in front of the anterioi- perforated spot, and runs along the edge of the longitudinal fissure to the point where the calloso-marginal fissure turns up to the edge of the hemisphere. It is continuous over the edge of the longitu- dinal fissure with the inner orljital, superior frontal, ascending frontal, and ascending parietal convolutions. The gyrus fornicatus (2) is a well-marked convolution A\duch begins at the anterior perforated space in the base of the In-ain, and Pio. 301.â€”The inner and under surfaces of the brain to show the convolutions.

It becomes connected in its course with the frontal convolutions, the quadrate lobe, the cuneus, and the lingual lobule. As it winds round the splenium of the corj^us callosum it bomids the fissure of the hippocampus which forms the hippocampus major ; hence this portion of the gyrus receives the name of gyrus hippocavipi. Posterior to the marginal convolution and continuous below with the gyrus fornicatus is the quadrate lobe {frecuneus) (q), which is separated from the cuneus lobe (o) by the parieto-occipital fissure (po), a continuation of the fissure of the same name seen externally.505 STRUCTURE OF THE CONVOLUTIONS. The quadrate lobe or precuneus (q), the inner portion of the pai-ietal lobe, is bounded in front by the calloso-marginal fissure, and behind by the parieto-occipital fissure ; below it is continuous with the gyrus fornicatus, and above -\\ith the superior parietal con- volution. The cuneus lobe (o) is triangular in shape, and is placed between the parieto-occipital and the calcarine fissure (c); the latter separates it from the internal convolutions of the temporal lobe (t). The calcarine fissure (c) of Huxley runs below the cuneus lobe to the extremity of the gyrus fornicatus, being joined niidway by the parieto-occipital fissure. It is an important fissure, since it corresj)onds to the projection called the hippocampus minor in the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The internal temporal convolutions form the lower part of the inner wall of the hemisphere, and are continuous with those of the temporal lobe externally. The most important is the uncinate (fyrns (3), which is immediately below the calcarine fissure and runs horizontally forward, becoming united with the gyrus fornicatus and passing in front of the fascia dentata. It then makes a sudden bencl backward for half an inch, this hook-like process from which it derives its name becoming united with the tsenia hippo- campi. The collateral fissure (Co) separates this last convolution from the inferior temporal convolutions, which are A'ery irregular. It causes the prominence in the descending cornu of the lateral ven- tricle known as the eminentia collateralis. The dentate fissure (10) is that immediately above the unci- nate gyrus which lodges the fascia dentata, and corresi^onds to the hippocampus major in the descending cornu of the lateral ven- tricle. Immediately above this is a small dentate convolution (4), united with the tcenia hippocauipi, and continuous below with the uncinate gyrus. Structure of the Convolutions. The convolutions are composed internally of white nerve matter continuous witli that which forms the great bulk of the interior of the brain; externally they are covered by several superimposed layers of grey uiatter, each layer having certain characteristics which serve to distinguish it from its fellows. The layers vary in their numl)er and dejjth in diflerent brains and in different parts of the same brain, but in the parietal lobe it is easy with the microscope to distinguish that they are five in number. The first or external layer forms about one-tenth of the thick- nes.s of the cortex. It is pale in colour, and consists chiefiy of neuroglia, in wliich a few scattered stellate nerve-cells are found, and near the surface numerous fine varicose medullated nerve- fibres, crossing each other in all directions. The second layer, of about the same width, is made up of closely set small pyramidal nerve-cells Avith liranching processes, the apex5o6 CEREBRUM, in every instance V of the pyramid Ijeing a little drawn out, and directed towards the surface of the convolution. The third layer is wider and paler tlian the second ; it consists of lai'ge pyramidal cells separated into groups by the radiating fibres of the hemisphere. The fourth layer is composed of small, closely set, angular corpuscles, placed iir- regularly, and imperfectly separated into groups. Tlie fifth is a layer of fusiform coi-- puscles which are placed vertically to the summit of a gyrus, but parallel to the surface of a sulcus. With the unaided eye it is easy to note the alternation of whitish -with reddish- grey layers, but it is at all times difficult, even with the mici'oscope, to ascertain the number of layers, or to define accurately the limits of each. The Interior of the Cerebrum. If the brain be placed upon its base, and the upper part of one hemisphere, at about one-third from its summit, be re- moved with a scalpel, a centre of white substance Avill be observed, surrounded Idv a narrow border of grey, which follows the line of the sulci and convolutions, and presents a zigzag form. This section is called centrum ovale minus; it is spotted by numerous small red points (pmicta vasculosa), which are produced b}^ the escape of blood from the cut ends of minute arteries and veins. Separate carefully the two hemisplieret- of the cerebrum, and a Inroad band of white suljstance (corpus callosum) will be seen to connect them ; it will be seen also that the surface of the hemisphere, where it comes in contact with the corjjus callosum, is bounded by the gyrus fornicatus. The sulcus between this convolution and the corpus callosum has been termed the " ^'en- tricle of the corpus callosum." If the upper part of each hemisphere be removed to a level A^dth the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medullary matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey substance corresponding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemi- spheres, will be seen ; this is the centrum ovale majns of Vieusseii?^. The corpus callosum is a thick layer of fibres passing trans- versely between the two hemispheres, and constituting their arcai Fig. 302.â€”Section of grey cortex of a convolution. I, 2, 3, 4, 5. The five layers described in the next. m. The white centre of the brain.I CORPUS CALLOSUM. commissure. It is situated in the middle line of the centrum ovale ] nil jus, but nearer the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, and ends anteriorly in a rounded border, genu, which may be traced downwards to the base of the brain in front of the commissure of the optic nerves ; it here gives off two narrow white bands called peduncles, which diverge from each other and pass backwards across the substantia perforata to the fissure of Syhdus, where they terminate. Posteriorly it forms a thick rounded fold, splenium, w hich is connected on its luider surface with the fornix; throughout the rest of its extent the corpus callosum is con- nected on its under sur- face with the septiun luci- dum. The length of the corpus callosum is about four inches. Along the middle line is the raphe, a linear depression between two slightly elevated longi- tudinal bands (chordce lon- llitadinales Lancisii); and, on each side of the raphe, may be seen the li7iece transversa}, which mark the direction of the fibres of which the corpus callosum is composed. These fibres may be traced into the hemispheres on each side, and they will be seen to be crossed at about an inch Fig. 303.â€”Section of the brain showing the cen- trum ovale majiis and corpus callosum. i, 1.

Beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum is the transverse fissure of the cerebrum, which extends between the hemispheres and crura cerebri from near the fissure of Syhdus on one side, to the same point on the opposite side of the brain. It IS through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the velum mterpositum. If a superficial incision be made through the corpus callosum on leach side of the raplie, two irregular cavities will be opened, which ;extend from one extremity of the hemispheres to the other; these5o8 CEREBRUM. are the lateral ventricles. To e xpose them completely, their upper boundary sliould Ije removed with the scissors. In making tliis dis- section tlie thin and diaphanous lining membrane of the ventricles may fre(|uently be seen. LATERAL VENTRICLES.â€”Each lateral ventricle is divided inUj a central cavity and three smaller cavities called cornua. The ante- rior cornu curves forwards and outwards in the anterior ]ol>e ; llie middle cornu descends into the nuddle lobe; and the posterior cornu passes backwards in tlie i)osterior lol)e, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. The central cavity is triangular in form, being bounded al)Ove {roof) by the coi'pus callosum ; internall}- by the septum lucidum, which separates it from the opposite ven- tricle ; and below {floor) hj the following parts, taken in their order of position from before backwards : â€” Corpus striatum, Choroid plexus. Tenia semicircularis, Corpus fimbriatum. Thalamus opticus, Fornix. The corpus striatum is named from the striated lines of white and grey matter which are seen upon cutting into its substance. The portion of it which is seen in the lateral ventricle is the intra- ventricular nucleus or nucleus caudatus. Its anterior extremity forms a rounded projection in the anterior cornu ; from whence it may be traced outwards and backwards, along the outer border of the optic thalamus, and separated from it by the stria terminalis. It becomes much narrower as we trace it backwards (the ajojjearance thus pro- duced giving rise to the name of nucleus caudatus), and its extremity will be found in the roof of the middle or descending horn. The other parts of the corpus striatum will be described when the structures seen in a transverse section of the brain are under con- sideration. The taenia semicircularis or stria terminalis is a narrow whitish band, extending along the posterior border of the corpus striatum, and serving as a bond of connection between that body and the thalamus opticus. It joins the anterior pillar of the fornix and is continued with it to the corpora albicantia. The tenia is partly con- cealed by a large vein {vena corimris striati), which receives numerous small veins from the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, and terminates in the vena Galeni of its own side. The thalamus opticus {thalamus, a bed) is an oblong body, having a thin coating of white substance on its surface ; and ha.s received its name from liaving tlie optic tract lying against its under surface. It is the inferior ganglion of the cerebrum. Part only of the thalamus is seen in the floor of the lateral ventricle ; we must, therefore, defer its further description until we can examine it in its entire extent. The choroid plexus (xoptoj/, ei8os, resembling the chorion) is a vascular fringe extending obliquely across the iloor of the lateral ventricle, and sinking into the middle cornu. Anteriorly, it is I509 LATERAL VENTRICLES. small and tapering, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventricle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius. This foramen may be seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum hicidum with the "handle of the knife. It is situated between the under surface of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, and forms a communication transversely between the lateral ventricles, and perpendicularly with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus presents on its surface a number of minute vascular processes, which are termed villi. They are covered bv an epithelium consisting of a single layer of nucleated polygonal Fig. 304.â€”Lateral ventricles of the cerebrum, t, i.

Besides the nucleus the cells contain numerous yellow granules and one or two dark oil-drops ; and, according to Heiile, give off from their angles spine-like processes, wliicli are connected \vith the bed of homogeneous areolar tissue on which they rest. The chief arteries of the choroid jilexxises enter at the lower ex- tremity of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle ; others enter it from behind by passing beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum ; the veins terminate in the veins of Galen. The corpus fimbriatum is a narrow white band, situated inter- nally to the choroid plexus, and extending with it into the descend- ing cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thinCEREBRUM. edge of the fornix, and being attached to the hippocampus major in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, is also termed Uenia. hippocampi. The fornix is a white layer of medullary substance, of which a portion only is seen in this view of the ventricle. The anterior cornu is triangular in form, sweeping outwards and terminating by a point in the anterior lobe of the brain, at a short distance ivom its siu-face. It has projecting into its cavity the nucleus caudatus of the corjaus striatum. The posterior cornu curves inwards, as it extends back into the posterior lobe of the brain and likewise terminates near the surface. An elevation corresponding with the calcarine fissure on the inner surface of the hemisphere, projects into the area of this cornu, and is called the hippocam'pus vdnor or calcar avis. The middle or descending cornu, in descending into the middle kibe of the brain, forms a very considerable curve, and alters its direction several times as it proceeds. Hence it is described as passing backwards and outwards and dowTiwards, and then turning forwards and inwards. This complex expression of a very simple curve has given origin to a symbol, formed of the primary letters of the term, by \\ hich the student is enabled to recollect more easily the course of the cornu, bodfi. It is the largest of the three cornua, and terminates close to the fissure of Sylvius, after having cur^â– ed around the crus cerebri. The middle cornu should now be laid open by inserting the, little finger into its cavity, and making it serve as a director for the scalpel in cutting away the side of the hemisphere, so as to expose it completely. The superior boundary of the middle cornu is formed by the fibres of the corpus callosum, as they arch downwards to reach the temporo-sphenoidal lobe ; with these the tail of the nucleus caudatus and the fibi-es of the ttenia semicircularis are united. The inferior wall presents for examination the following parts :â€” Hippocampus major. Corpus fimbriatuiu, Pes hippocampi. Choroid plexus, Pes accessorius. Fascia dentata, Transverse fissure. The hippocampus major or cornu ammonis is a considerable projection from the inferior wall, and extends tlie whole length of the middle cornu. Its extremity is likened to the foot of an animal, from its presenting a number of knuckle-like elevations on the sur- face, and is named 2^es hipiJocamjn. Tlie hippocampus major corre- sponds to the sulcus on the inner side of the gyrus foi'nicatus, as that convolution winds I'ound beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum to end in the uncinate gyrus. If the hippocampus he cut across the section will be seen to resemble the extremity of a convoluted scroll, consisting of alternate layers of white and grey substanci'. 4iTRANSVERSE FISSURE. 5" The pes accessorius (eminentia collateralis) is a swelling some- what resembling the liippocampus major, but smaller m size, and situated in the angular interval between it and the hippocampus It is formed by the protrusion minor of the sulcus describee! above as the collateral fissure. The corpus fimbriatum (tsenia hip- pocampi) is the thinned and flattened posterior pillar of the fornix, which is prolonged from the central cavity of the ventricle, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major. It is lost inferiorly in the hippocamj)iis. Fascia Dentata. â€” If the corpus fimbriatum be carefully raised,, a nar- row serrated band of grey substance, the margin of the grey substance of the middle lobe, A\'ill be seen beneath it; this is the fascia dentata. It is so called from presenting an appear- ance resembling a regular row of teeth. Transverse Fissure.â€”Beneath the corpus fimbriatum will be seen the transverse fissure of the brain, which Fig. 305- -Sectiou through the hippocampus major, showing fascia dentata. i.

Section through the hippocampus. extends from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, across to the same point on the opposite side. It is through this fissure that the pia mater com- municates with the choroid plexus, and the latter obtains its supply of blood. The fissure is bounded above by the corpus callosum and fornix in the middle, and on each side by a free margin of the hemisphere formed by the fascia dentata and corpus fimbriatum ; inferiorly, it is bounded near the middle line by the corpus qiiadri- gemina, and on each side by the back part of the optic thalamus. In its central part it lodges the velum interj)ositum. Septum Lucidum.â€”The internal boundary of the lateral ven- tricle is the septum lucidum. This septum is thin, semi-transparent, and consists of two laminte of cerebral substance attached above to the under surface of the corpus callosum at its anterior part, and below to the fornix. Each of these laminse consists of white and grey matter, the white being situated on the surface looking towards the lateral ventricle, the grey matter nearer the middle line of the brain. Between the two layers is a narrow space, the fifth ven- tricle, which is lined by a proper membrane. The fifth ventricle may be shown by snipping through the septum lucidum transversely with the scissors. The corpus callosum should now be cut aci'oss towards its an- terior extremity, and the two ends carefully dissected awav. The anterior portion will Ije retained only by the septum lucidum, butCEREBRUM. 512 the posterior will be found incorporated with the white layer be- neath, which is the foi'uix. Fornix.â€”Tlie fornix (arch) is an arched band of white substance, placed in the floor of tlie lateral ventricle, and intimately connected posteriorly with the nndei' surface of the corpus callosuni. It con- sists of two lateral halves which unite in tlie middle of the lateral ventricle forming the body, Imt diverge from each other posteriorly as the ])osterior ijillars or crura., and anteriorly as the anterior pillan or crura. The two anterior crura descend in a curved direction to the base of the brain, embedded in the anterior ]iart of the Fig. 306.â€”Vertical longitudinal section of the brain, i.

At the base of the brain they make a sudden c^r^â– e upon themselves and constitute the corpora albicantia, from which they may be traced upwards to the thalami optici. Opening trans- versely beneath these two crura, just as they are about to arch down- wards, is the foramen of communication between the lateral and the third ventricle, the foramen of Monro ; or foramen commune anterii^. The choroid plexuses and the veins of the corpora striata pass through this opening. The lateral thin edges of the fornix are continuous posteriorly with the concave border of the hippocampus major at each sidt-513 THALAMI OPTICI. aud form tlie narrow white band called corpios fimbriatum or tcBnia hip2)ocampi. In the middle line the fornix lies in contact by its upper surface with the corpus callosum, and by its under surface with the velum interpositum. The fornix may now be removed by dividing it across anteriorly, and turning it backwards, at the same time separating its lateral connections with the hippocampi. On examining its under surface it will be noticed that where the posterior pillars diverge from each other they expose the fibres of the corpus callosum, and that these are for the most part transverse. The appearance presented by the lateral bars formed by the fornix and the transverse lines of the corpus callosum, has been named the lyra from a fancied resem- blance to a harp. Velum Interpositum,â€”Beneath the fornix is the velum inter- positum (tela choroidea), a fold of pia mater introduced into the interior of the brain through the transverse fissure. It extends from the foramen of Monro in front to the back j)art of the splenium of the corj)US callosum behind ; laterally, it passes beneath the edge of the fornix and reaches the floor of the lateral ventricles, where it is connected with the choroid jjlexuses of those cavities. In this way it gives to the edge of the fornix that fringed ajDpearance from which its name of corpus Jimbriatuvi has been deiived. On its under surface the velum forms the roof of the third ventricle, having attached to it the choroid plexuses of the latter cavity ; and at the back part it is intimately connected with the pineal body. In the centre of its upper aspect run twa. veins, the veins of Galen, which receive blood from the interior of the ventricles, and empty it into the straight sinus. The velum interpositum is coated with an epithelium identical with that of the choroid jjlexuses ; and around the pineal body the areolar tissue is abundant and strong. If the vehim interpositum be raised and turned back, an opera- tion to be conducted with care, particularly at its posterior part, where it invests the pineal body, the thalami optici and the cavity of the third ventricle will be brought into view. Thalami Optici.â€”The thalami optici are two oval bodies, of a white colour superficially, inserted between the two diverging portions of the corpora striata, and resting upon the upper surface of the crura cerebri. In the middle line a fissure exists between them which is called the third ventricle. The anterior part forms a rounded prominence immediately behind the tosnia seniicircularis and is called the anterior tubercle ; the posterior extremity forms a free rounded border, projecting into the transverse fissure of the brain, the 2^osterior tubercle or pulvinar. Beneath the latter lie two small rounded elevations, the external and internal geniculate bodies separated from each other by one of the roots of the optic nerve.' The corpus geniculatum externum, the larger of the two, and of a greyish colour, is the principal origin of the optic nerve. The upper surface of the optic thalamus is marked by a shallow groove, which distinguishes the limit of the floor of the lateral ventricle ; and 2 K514 CEKEBRUM. at till! jiiuctiou of tliL! internal and uppej' surfaces a band ui white fibres will be noticed constituting tlie peduncle of the pinedl hody. Between the u])])er edge of tlic pulvinar and the peduncle of tlie pineal body is a triangular depi'cssion called trigonum hahmiihn. Anteriorly, the thalami are connected with the corpoi-a albicfintia by means of two white bands, which are the ternnnations of tli(- crura of the fornix. Externally, they are in relation with tlie corpoj striata and hemisplieres. In their interior the thalami are chiefly composed of grey matter arranged in three masses, tlie anterior, ex- ternal, and internal nuclei. Third Ventricle.â€”The third ventricle is the fissure between tlie two thalami optici, and is the remains of the anterior cerebral vesicle. It is bounded above by the under surface of the velum interposituni, from which are suspended the choroid plexuses of the third ven- tricle, and is separated by the velum from the body of the fornix. Its jloor is formed by the lamina cinerea, the tuber cinereurii, infundibuhim, corpora albicantia, and locus perfoi'atus posticus. Laterally, it is bounded by the thalami optici and peduncles of the pineal body ; anteriorly, by the anterior commissure and anterior crura of the fornix ; and posteriorly, by the posterior commissure and the aqueduct of Sylvius. The third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, anterior, middle, and posterior ; and communicates 11\ two openings, called foramen of Monro and aqueduct of Syhdus, with the lateral and fourth ventricles. The anterior commissure is a small rounded white cord, which connects tlie corpora striata of the two sides, and reaches the sub- stance of the hemispheres ; it lies immediately in front of the crura of the fornix, and is united by its anterior margin with the septuu. lucidum. The middle or soft commissure consists of grey sub- stance, which is continuous with the grey lining of the ventricle ; it connects the adjacent sides of the thalami optici. The posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white cord, connecting the two thalami optici jjosteriorly ; it is j^laced beneath the peduncles of the pineal body near their origin, and has beneath it the aqueduct of Sylvius. The foramen of Monro is the medium of communication be- tween the two lateral and third ventricles, and transmits superiorly the choroid plexus and veins of the corj)US striatum. The aqueduct of Sylvius, or iter a tertio ad quartuvi ventricnlum, leads backwards beneath the posterior commissure and through the base of the corpora quadrigemina to the uj^per part of the fourth ventricle. Corpora Quadrigemina.â€”The corpora quadrigemina, or optic lobes, are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and i)OS- terior commissure, and beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. They form, indeed, at this point, the inferior boundary of the transverse fissure of the hemispheres. The anterior pair of these bodies, grey in colour, are named nates; the posterior pair, white and much smaller than the anterior, are termed testes. FromPINEAL BODY. 51S the nates on each side may be traced a rounded process (bracliuuu suiwrior) which passes obliquely outwards into the thalamus opticus ; and from the testis a similar but smaller process (brachium interior) which has the same destination. The internal geniculate body lies in the interval of these two processes where they enter the thalamus, and behind the inferior brachium is a prominent band which marks the course of the superior division of the olivary iasci- culus. The corpora quadrigemina are perforated longitudinally through their base by the aqueduct of Sylvius ; they are covered m partly by the pia mater and partly by the velum interpositum, and the nates support the pineal body.

Pineal Body.â€”The pineal body (epiphysis cerebri) is a small reddish-grey body of a conical form (hence its synonym conarium), situated on the anterior part of the nates, and invested by a duplica- ture of pia mater derived from the under part of the velum inter- positum. It is connected to the brain by means of two cords of white matter called fedundes, which may be traced along the upper and inner margin of the thalami optici to the crura of the fornix with which they become blended. From the close connection sub- sisting between the pia mater and the pineal body, and the softness of texture of the latter, it is liable to be torn away in the removal of the pia mater.CEREBELLUM. CEREBELLUM. Tlie cei'ebelluiii, less than one-eighth the weight of tlie cerebrum, is situated beneath tlie occipital lobes, being lodged in the posterior fossa of the base of the ci-aniuni, and protected from tlie superin- cumbent pressure of the cerebrum by the tentorium cereljelli. Like the cerebrum, it is composed of grey and white substance, the former occupying the surface, the latter tlie interior, and its surface is formed of pai'allel lamella) separated by suhd, and here and there by deeper sulci. In form, the cerebellum is oblong and flattened, its greater diameter being from side to side, its two surfaces looking upwards and downwards, and its borders being anterior, posterior, and lateral. In consideration of its shape the cerebellum admits of a division into two hemispheres, into certain prominences termed processes and lobules, and into certain divisions of its substance called lobes, formed upon the hemispheres by the deeper sulci above refeii-ed to. On the anterior border of the organ there is a semilunar notch, incisura cerebelli anterior, which embraces the corj^ora quadrigemina. On the posterior border there is another notch, incisura cerebelli posterior, which receiA^es the upper part of the falx cerebelli; and on the under surface of the cerebellum is a deep fissure corre- sponding with the medulla oblongata, and termed the val- lecula (valley). Each hemisj^here of the cerebellum is divided by means of a fissure which runs along its free border into an upper and a lower portion, and upon each of these portions cer- tain lobes are marked out. Thus on the Fig. 308.â€”Under surface of cerebellum, the amygdalae upper portion there having been removed, i. Medulla oblongata. 2. Pons ^j.q ^-^yo SUCh lobeS, Varolii ^.

The central mass connecting the two hemispheres is called the worm (vermis) ; its upper aspect projects above the general level ofLOBES OF THE CEREBELLUM. 517 the cerebellum, and is called the superior vermiform process ; the lower part is lodged within the vallecula, and is named the inferior vermiform process. The superior vermiform process is very indis- tinctly demarcated from the upper surface of the hemispheres, the folia of the latter being continued into it; at its anterior border, about eight folia form the central lobe, a portion of which is con- tinued upwards on to the superior medullary velum or valve of Vieussens, and is termed, from its shape, the lingula. The posterior superior lobe is only represented in the superior vermiform process by a single well-marked lamina, the folia cacuminis. The inferior vermiform process is divisible into four lobes, namely : (i) the tuber vallce situated in the incisura jDosterior, and connecting the postero- inferior and slender lobes of the two sides ; (2) in front of this the pyramid, a small, obtusely pointed eminence connecting the biventral lobes ; (3) the uvida, jDlaced between the two tonsils ; and (4) the nodule or laminated tubercle, forming a free pointed anterior termi- nation to the process. Connecting the uvula on each side with the tonsil is a ridge of grey matter, the furroioed band. On each side of the nodule is a thin layer of white matter, the posterior medullary velum; it has a membranous texture, and terminates anteriorly in a crescentic border; laterally, each process can be traced into the flocculus. Between the posterior veluni and the nodule and uvula is a deep fossa which is known as the siuallow's nest (nidus hirundinis). The anterior medullary velum is the valve of Vieussens, which will be described in connection with the fourth ventricle. The cerebellum is connected with the rest of the encej^halon by means of three pairs of rounded cords or peduncles, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior peduncle (processus e cerebello ad testes) forms the superior lateral boundary of the fourth ventricle, and is continued upwards and forwards upon the upper surface of the cms cerebri to the corpora quadrigemina, beneath which its fibres decus- sate Avith those of the corresponding process of the opjDosite side ; higher up they may be traced into tlie white centre of the hemi- sphere. The middle pedtmcle (processus ad pontcm) connects the two hemispheres of the cerebellum, and is constituted by the transverse fibres of the pons. The inferior peduncle (processus ad medullam) is the connection of the cerebellum with the medulla and spinal cord, and lias been already descrilied under the title of resti- form body or tract. The three peduncles together form the crus cerebelli of each side. Structure of the Cerebellum.â€”A horizontal section of the cerebellum shows it to be composed, like the cerebrum, of an internal white mass, and of grey cortical matter; but the grey niattei greatly preponderates, so that the white centre is relatively small The white substance resembles the trunk of a tree, from which branches are given ofi', and from the branches, branchlets and leaves the two latter being coated by a moderately thick and uniform layer of grey substance. The appearance thus produced has received the name of arhor vitce cerehelke. In each lateral half of the whiteCEREBELLUM. centre will be seen an irregular mass of grey matter, forming a wavy line, and enclosing white matter ; this is the C(yrpu8 dentahm It exists as a grey capsule or pouch, which, however, is defective at its inner part. If the section Ijc made I'ather nearer to tlie under surface of the cere- ,_ bellum than its centre, other g^j^iat nuclei will be displayed in the 1 ^li ^ white centre. These are three in number on each side, and are named the nucleus fas- tigii, nucleus globosus, and nucleus emboliformis (Fig. 309). The nucleus fastigii is situated near the middle line ; it is rounded in front, but behind becomes forked. The nuclei (jlohosi generally con- sists of two or three round grey spots a little external to the ]Dreceding. The nucleus emboliformis is a club-shaped mass of grey matter running antero-posteriorly close to the inner side of the corpus den- tatum. Minute Structure, â€” The grey cortex is divisible into two layers, the outer being of a clear grey colour, and the inner rust- coloured and granular in ap- pearance. The external layer consists of a delicate neuroglia supporting nerve-fibres and nerve-cells ; the fibres run for the most jDart at right angles to the surface of the cerel:)ellum, and many of them are connected with the processes of the cells below; the cells are very small, and have the appearance of granules. The inner layer is formed also of granule-like cells very closely aggregated, and embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Between the inner and outer laj^ers is a single layer of peculiar cells called cells of Purhinje; they are chiefly flask-shaped, and give oft" from their deep aspect a single process which becomes connected with the axis-cylinder of a nerve in the white centre ; from its super- ficial surface each cell gives off two processes which branch very freely in an antler-like manner, some of their finer processes becoming connected with the round cells of the outer layer.

Fourth Ventricle. Dissection. â€” An oblique incision must be made through each half of the cerebellum, and the wedge-shaped intervening mass removed ; the mem- branes covering the back part of the medulla and pons must be carefully cleared away, when the fourth ventricle will be displayed. The fourth ventricle is the remains of the posterior cerel^ral vesicle of the embryo, and is situated between the cerebellum and the posterior surface of the medulla and pons ; it is diamond- shaped, with narrow angles directed Fig. 310.â€”m.

The wpfer angle has ojjening into it tlie aqueduct of Sylvius by whicli tlie fourth ventricle communicates with the tliird. Tlu' roof is tent-shaped, and is formed by a thin layer of grey mattei' connecting the up})er part of the two processus e cerebello ad testes called the valve of Vieussens {velum medullare anterius), by the anterior medullary velum, the nodule of the inferior vermifoi'iii process, and the i)ia mater passing from the latter to the medulla. A thickening of the epithelium on the under surface of the i)ia mater at the lower angle of the cavity gives rise to a process called the obex, and a similar thickening running along the side wall froiii the obex to the lateral recess is called the ligula (Fig. 312, l). The floo7- has running down its centre a slight gi^oove continuous with the postei-ior median fissure of the cord, and, crossing its middle, some trans- verse lines, the strice acusticce. These lines mark the superior limit of the medulla ; they also serve to divide the floor of the A^entricle into two tri- angles, the upper lielonging to the medulla, and the lower to the pons. These are again divided vertically Ijy the median fissure, and each of the four divisions so formed is marked by a triangular depression or fovea. The division formed by the medulla may be defined as consisting of (i) the depres- sion of the inferior fovea; (2) a ridge between it and the median fissure, the fascicxihts teres; (3) a pro- minence between the fovea and the lateral wall, the tuberculum amsticum; and (4) a grey mass between the fovea and the inferior angle, the ala cinerea. In like manner the area belonging to the pons consists of: (i) the superior fovea, (2) the upper part of the fasciculus teres, and (3) a pigmented area between the superior fovea and the lateral wall, the locus ceruleus. The lateral houndaries of the ventricle are : in the upper part, the two processus e cerebello ad testes ; in the lower, the funiculi graciles witli their clavce ; above these the funiculi cuneati, and still higher up the restiform bodies. The roof of the fourth ventricle has been already described as partly formed by pia mater covered by epithelium. In the part so formed there is a small opening, the foramen of Magendie, placed a little above the calamus sciiptorius, by means of M'hich the cavity of the ventricle communicates with the i:)osterior sub-arachnoid space ; other openings also exist in each lateral recess. In the floor of the fourth ventricle are placed the nuclei of origin of tlie chief cranial nerves, as well as the vaso-motor, cardiac, and respiratory centres. The nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve lies be- neath the fasciculus teres. In the lower part of the ala cinerea is situated the nucleus of the spinal accessory nerve ; in its upper part the nuclei of the vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, the latter being Pig. .312. â€” Dia- grammatic view of the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, in.s.

The position of these nuclei will be best understood by reference to Fig. 313. Transverse Section of the Cerebrum. Transverse vertical sections of the cerebrum at different levels are useful for the purpose of ascertaining the relative position of the structures in the interior, and more especially for determining the relation which the two great l)asal ganglia, tlie thalamus opticus and corpus striatum, bear to each other and to surrounding parts. The figure here given (Fig. 314) is taken from a recent section of theTRANSVERSE SECTION OF CEREBRUM. 522 brain, wliicli has been made immediately behind the corpora albi- cantia ; it passes tliroiigh the hiteral and third ventricles, the middle horn of the lateral ventricles, island of Reil, thalamus opticus, fornix, and corpus striatum. The latter is now seen to Ije a composite body made up of several independent nuclei; its full description is as follows. The corpora striata are two pyriform bodies placed with their broad ends forwards and their narrow ends Imckwai'ds.

The intraventricular portion is named nucleus caudatus ; its large end, or head, is directed forwards and projects into the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle ; its smaller end or tail runs on the outer side of the thalamus, and narrowing as it pro- ceeds backwards, terminates by a pointed end m the roof of the descending horn. The extraventricular portion lies to the outer side of the optic thalamus, and between it and the island ot Keil;CRUEA CEREBRI. it is cliiefly formed by a large nucleus, which on horizontal section presents the apj)earance of a biconvex lens ; hence it has been named the lenticular nucleus. In a transverse vertical section this nucleus appears triangular, with the base directed outwards and the apex inwards ; the grey matter which forms its bulk is streaked by numerous white fibres which radiate as they pass through it into the convolutions. On the inner side the lenticular nucleus is sej)arated from the nucleus caudatus and thalamus opticus by a strand of white matter called the interned ccqmile, and on the outer side a similar but less-marked band called external capsule lies be- tween it and the island of Eeil ; a grey streak in the middle of the latter has been named the teniaform nucleus or claustrum. The crura cerebri or cerebral peduncles are two rounded white masses which proceed from the upper margin of the pons, and, diverging from each other, enter cq the under aspect of the hemi- / \ The tegmentum is traversed in Origin of the third nerve, the middle line near its upper part liy the aqueduct of Sylvius, which in cross-section is triangular or T-shaped ; and beneath the floor of this canal is a small grey nucleus on each side which gives origin to the third nerves. Beneath the nucleus of the third, a bundle of longitudinal nerve fibres is seen, constituting the pos- terior longitudinal bundle (jj.l.b.), and about the middle of the peduncle there is a spheroidal mass of nuclear matter, named from Its colour the red nucleus; it is traversed by the fibres of the third nerve. Tlie bulk of the tegmentum is formed by a continuation upwards of the formatio reticularis of the pons, which is in its turn continued into a reticular layer beneath the thalamus. Towards the outer side, however, is a band of white fibres called the fillet; it lies Transverse Section of the Crura Cerebri. sj^heres in the region of the basal ganglia. In front of the diverging crura is the posterior perforated space and corpora albicantia, while the third nerve issues from the inner side of each cms, and the fourth nerve from the outer side ; on their uj)per aspect they are inseparable from the corpora quadrigemina. A transverse sec- tion (Fig. 315) shows the crura to be divisible into two parts, an upper, called the tecjmentum, and a lower, tlie crusta; separated by a transverse band of pigmented grey matter, the locus niger.

The crusta is conqjosed entirely of longi- tudinal nerve l);indles communicating between the cerebrum and medulla, and the cerebrum and cerebellum. The middle l)and is the largest, and consists of the fibres of the pyramidal tract; the band on the outer side contains fibres passing to the temporo-occi- pital convolutions ; and that on the inner side, fibres connecting the frontal lobes and cerebellum. The two crusta are completely separate; the tegmenta are united, \mt their line of fusion is marked by an incomplete septum. The locus niger {s^ibstantia nigra) is composed of deeply pigmented nerve-cells with many branching processes; nothing is known of the connections or uses of this large mass of grey matter. Lining Membrane of the Ventricles. The lining membrane of the ventricles, ependyma veniriculorum, is a serous layer distinct from the arachnoid ; it lines the whole of the interior of the lateral ventricles, and is connected with the attached border of the choroid plexus, so as to exclude direct communication between the lateral ventricles and the exterior of the brain. From the lateral ventricles it is reflected through the foramen of Monro on each side into the third ventricle, Avhich it invests throughout. From the third it is conducted into the fourth ventricle, through, the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculuni, and after lining its interior becomes continuous inferiorly ^dth the sub-arachnoid tissue of the spinal cord. The lining mem- brane of the ventricles is provided with an epithelium which is ciliated in patches and is the source of the secretion which moistens and lubricates their interior. The fifth ventricle has a separate lining membrane. The epithelium of the e])endyma ventriculorum is siipported Ijy a delicate layer of modified connective tissue, similar to that de- scribed in the spinal cord iinder the name of neuroglia. White Matter of the Cerebrum. The white matter of the cerebrum consists of medullated nerve- fibres, varying in size in dift'ercnt parts, but generally smaller than those of the spinal cord and medulla. They may be conveniently arranged into three sets, viz., (r) ascending ovpeduncular, (2) transverse or commissural, and C3) longitiuiinal or collateral. The peduncular fibres may again be divided into {a) those ascend- ing in the crusta of the crus, and (6) those reaching the cerebrum through the tegmentum. The fibres derived from the crusta pass chiefly in the inner capsule of the corpus striatum, and from thence into llic white centre of the hemispheres, where they spread out in a fan-like arrangement, forming the corona radiata, and ultimately reach tlie fAETERIES OF THE BRAIN. gl'ey cortex of the convolutions. The most definite band of these fibres is continued upwards from the pyramidal tract of the medulla, and passes to the convolutions bordering on the fissure of Eolando (motor area of the cortex). Another set of these fibres passes from the lateral part of the crusta to the occipital lobe of the cerebrum (direct sensory tract). The innermost fibres of the crusta_ may be traced beneath the thalamus to terminate in the under part of the len- ticular nucleus (ansa lenticularis). The fibres of the tegmentum consist of the bundles traversing the formatio reticularis ; they are joined by those passing from the cerebellum in the processus e cere- bello ad testes, and proljably some strands from the corpora quadri- gemina and other nuclei. Passing beneath the thalamus they enter that nuclear mass, but some run on the outer side thereof, to join the corona radiata, and jjass from thence to the cortex of the temporo- sphenoidal and occipital lobes. The transverse or commissural fibres include (i) the anterior commissure of the third ventricle, (2) the posterior commissure, and (3) the transverse fibres of the corjjus callosum. The longitudinal or collateral fibres include the following : viz., (i) the fornix, (2) toenia semicircularis, (3) strioe longitudinales of the corjjus callosum, (4) fibres of the gyrus f ornicatus (superior longitudinal commissure), (5) a white bundle of fibres at the bottom of the fissure of Sylvius, connecting the frontal with the temjjoro-sphenoidal lobe and called the uncinate fasciculus, (6) a bundle of fibres lying in the outer wall of the posterior and middle horns of the lateral ventricles, connecting the occipital and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and named the inferior lovgitndinal fasciculus, and (7) cossociation fibres passing betAveen the several convolutions, and between difterent parts of the same convolution (A. Campbell Clark). The connection of the fibres in the cerebiaim with those in the medulla and spinal cord will be best understood from the table given on page 526, and derived chiefly from J. Rylands Whitaker. Arteries of the Brain. The arteries of the brain present certain ].ieculiarities which render it necessary that they should be studied apart from the eneral arterial system, and along with the organ to which they are istributed. The important anastomotic connection at the base of the brain called the circle of Willis has been described on a previous page (402), and it is only necessary here to recall the fact that from that circle three main trunks, called anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, are given oft' on each side to the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of the brain. The branches derived from these trunks are of two kinds : medullar?/, which pass to the basal ganglia and neighbouring parts; and cortical, which are distributed to the convolutions of the five lobes into which the cerebrum is divided. These two systems of arteries are almost entirely independent of each other, what communications exist between them being very few% O P P Q o s Â« 3 P-.2 P " cs a ^ Si o 2 OS s g o S .2 t; 3 O S s a (11 â– +-* o o o OOoo o & o u -3 s .2 a Iâ€”I CO m O H - I w Â« ^ o 02 P . o O W H i25 O W a; Hi 1-1 P ft O o O o S -e S Eb 3" o a 1=1.2 s g a CO S-t oS o u OS 43 S o o1 â–  G â€¢c s Do o 1 u !>> a o a o Iâ€”t ^ CQ ^ rH CQ S O C3 â– g â€¢ i-H 0) s o p< d o o CD p h c s c o a 0) o no h4 3 to ID H 3 c9 g <1> u S -M O goAETERIES OF THE BEAIN. 527 in uiuuber, and of capillary luinuteness ; the iudividual branches also of each system are distributed to independent areas, and only comninnicate with their fello^x's at the margins of those areas, by few and small communications ; hence they are distinguished as end arteries. As a necessary result of this arrangement, one artery cannot take the place or perform the work of another, as we so often find to be the case in other parts of the body, but if an artery becomes plugged, the area to which it is distributed becomes deprived of nourisliment and rapidly undergoes degeneration. The following is a brief description of the chief branches of the three arteries men- tioned above. Anterior Cerebral.â€”The medullary, branches of this trunk are fcAV in number; they are given off close to its origin from the in- ternal carotid, pass through the anterior part of the substantia per- forata, and are distributed to the front of the corpus striatum, and genu of the corpus callosum. The cortical branches are four in number. The first of these is distributed to the internal orbital convolutions; the second to the anterior part of the marginal con- volution, the anterior part of the middle frontal convolution, and the superior frontal convolution; tlie third to the inner surface of the hemisphere as far back as the ascending portion of the calloso- marginal fissure. The fourth supplies the cpiadrate lobe, and gives off a Ibranch which enters the corpus callosum and supjilies its structure. Middle Cerebral.â€”This is the largest artery of the three, and from its position is frequently named the Sylvian artery; it is distributed chieliy to the motor convolutions of the brain. The medullary branches are numerous; they enter the openings in the substantia perforata, and passing directly uj)wards are distributed to the extraventricular nuclei of the corpus striatum, and the back part of the nucleus caudatus. The main trunk of the middle cerebral passes upwards in the fissure of Sylvius, and as it lies against the island of Reil divides into four cortical brandies. The first of these is distributed to the outer part of the orbital surface and inferior frontal convolution ; the second to the posterior part of the middle frontal and three-fourths of the ascending frontal convolution ; the third to the rest of the ascending frontal, ascending parietal, and anterior part of the superior parietal, and the fourth to the in- ferior parietal (supra-marginal) and superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution. Posterior Cerebral.â€”Most of the viedullari/ branches of this artery enter the locus perforatus posticus, but a few are given off on the outer side of the crus cerebri; both sets are distributed to the thalamus opticus, crus cerebri, and corpora quadrigemina. The cortical branches are three in number ; the first passes to the an- terior part of the uncinate gyrus, the second to the back part of the same convolution and the lower part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and the tliird to the occipital lobe. The convolutions to which this artery is distributed are for tlie most part sensory in function.528 TOPOGRAPHY OF 'J'HE BRAIN. Relations of the Chief Sulci and Convolutions to the Exterior of the Skull. The relations of the sulci and convolutions of the cerebrum t<j the exterior of the skull are of great importance, in consequence of tlie increasing frequency with which operations are now peiformed for the removal of tumours and otlier morbid products from the con- ridge.

Our space will only permit of a brief notice of the chief " landmarks " useful in such operations. The longitudinal fissure corresponds to a line drawn from tlie root of the nose (nasion) to the external occipital j)rotuberance (inion). Fissure of Sylvius.â€”The bifurcation of this fissure corresponds to a point an inch and a quarter behind the external angular process of the frontal and about a quarter of an inch above its lower extre- mity. From this j)oint the vertical portion passes directly u])M'ards for about three-quarters of an inch, running parallel to and imine-529 MEMBEANES OF THE BEAIN. diately behind the coronal suture. The horizontal limb of this fissure corresponds to a line drawn from a point an inch and an eighth behind the external angular process to a little below the most pro- minent part of the parietal eminence ; it is covered for the middle three-fifths of its course by the upper part of the squamous suture. Fissure of Rolando.â€”The upper end of this fissure is situated at a point on tlie line from the nasion to the inion measuring 55.6 per cent, of the whole line, starting from the front {Hare's line). It runs dowuAvards and forwards for about 3I inches, forming an angle of 67Â° with the line of the sagittal suture (middle line). Its lower end is situated about half an inch behind the bifurcation of the fissure of Sylvius and close to the horizontal limb, Keid, in order to define the i^osition of the fissure of Kolando more accurately, takes a base line from the lowest part of the infiva-oi'bital margin, through the external auditory meatus to the back of the head ; he next marks out the course of the fissure of Sylvius according to the above rules ; two vertical lines are then drawn, reaching from the base line to the line of the sagittal suture, one passing tli rough the depression in front of the auditory meatiis, and the other through the posterior border of the mastoid process. A line drawn from the u^iper end of the posterior line to the i^oint where the anterior one crosses the fissure of Sylvius, marks out the course of the fissure of Eolando. The parieto-occipital fissure runs horizontally outwards from the longitudinal fissure, at a iioint about one-fifth of an inch in front of the lambda. If the line marking the horizontal part of the fissure of Sylvius is continued backwards till it reaches the sagittal suture, the posterior inch of its course Avill mark the parieto-occipital fissure. Membranes of the Brain. Dissection.â€”To examine the brain with its meml)ranes, the upper part of the skidl must be removed, by sawing through the external table and breakiug the internal table Avith the chisel and hammer. After the calvarium has been loosened all round, it will require a considerable degree of force to tear the bone away from the dura mater. This adhesion is particularly firm at the sutures, where the dura mater is continuous with a membranous layer in- terposed between the edges of the bones ; in other situations the connection results from numerous vessels which permeate the inner tal)le of the skull. Tlie adliesion subsisting between the dura mater and bone is greater in the young subject and in old persons than in the adult. On lieiug torn away, the internal table Avill present numerous deeply grooved and rauiified cliannels, corresjwnding with the branches of the meningeal arteries. Along the middle line will be seen a groove corresponding with tlie superior longitudinal sinus, and on either side may be frecpiently observed some small fossfe, corresponding with the Pacchionian bodies. The membranes of the brain and spinal cord areâ€”the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. 2 L530 MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. The dura mater is the firm whitish or greyish layer wliich is In-oiiglit into view when the calvarium is removed. It is a strong fibrous membrane, somewhat himinated in texture, and composed of white fil:)rous tissue. Lining the interior of the ci'anium, it HerveÂ« as tlie intei'Tial periosteum of that cavity ; it is prolonged also into the spinal column, but is not adherent to the bones in that canal as in the cranium. It is very firndy attached to the mai'gin of the foT'amen magnum, and to the foramina of exit of the cranial nerves. From the internal surface of the dura mater, processes are directed inwards for the support and protection of parts of the l)rain ; Avhile from its exterior, other processes are ])rolonged outwards to form sheaths for the nerves as they quit the skull. Its external surface is rough and fibrous, and corresponds with the internal table of the skull. The internal surface is smooth, and lined by endothelium ; it was formerly regarded as a reflected layer of the arachnoid meml)rane. On the external sirrface of the dura mater the branches of the middle meningeal artery may be seen ramifying ; and in the middle line is a depressed groove, formed by the subsidence of the upper wall of the superior longitudinal sinus. The Pacchionian bodies {glandulce Pacchioni) are small, round, whitish granulations, occurring singly or in clusters, and forming small groups of various sizes along the margin of the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, and more particularly near the summit of the latter. They are absent in infancy, increase in numbers in adult life, and are abundant in the aged. They are simply enlarged of the arachnoid, and consist of a spongy tissue continuous Avith the sub-arachnoid tissue and of the same composition, covered by a layer of epithelial cells. When of large size they cause absorption of the bone, and so come to be lodged in depressions or j)its in the interior of the vertex of the skull. If the student cut through one side of the dura mater, in the direction of his incision through the skull, and turn it upwards towards the middle line, he will observe the smooth internal surface of this membrane. He will j)erceive also the large veins of the hemispheres passing from liehind forwards to open into the superior longitudinal sinus. If he introduce the handle of his scalpel bet-w een the dura mater and arachnoid, he will see a vertical layer of the former descending between the hemispheres ; and if he draw one side of the brain a little outwards, he will be enabled to perceive the extent of the process of membrane which is called the falx cerebri. The processes of dui'a mater which are sent inwards towards the interior of the skull are the fa'x cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and fulx cerebelH. The falx cerebri (fnlx, a sickle, so named from its sickle-like appearance), narrow in front, broad beliind, and forming a sharp curved edge below, is attached in front to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone, and behind to the tentorium cerebelli ; betAveen these points it is connected with the inner surface of the cranium in the middle line. Along the attached border runs the superior531 TENTOKIUM AND FALX CEREBELLI. longitudinal sinus, and along the free edge the inferior longitudinal sinus, these vessels being situated between the two layers of which the membrane is composed. The tentorium cerebelli {te7iiorium, a tent) is a root of dura mater (raised in the centre and sloping down at the sides) thrown across the cerebellum and attached at each side to the margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; behind, to the transverse ridge of the occipital bone which lodges the lateral sinuses ; and m front to the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. It supports Fig. 317.â€”Sinuses and membriines of the brain (side view), i. Superior longitudinal sinus. 2. Falx cerebri. 3. Fifth nerve. 4. Inferior longitudinal sinus. 5. Fourth nerve. 6.

Its attached bor- der contains the lateral and superior petrosal sinuses, and the junction between it and the falx cerebri is channelled by the straight sinus. The falx cerebelli is a small process, generally double, attached to the vertical ridge of the occipital bone beneath the lateral sinus, and to the tentorium. It lodges the occipital sinuses and is received into the indentation between tlie two hemispheres of the cerebellum. Removal of the Brain.â€”The tentorium and falx cerebelli cannotMEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 532 be seen until the brain is removed ; but tlie attacliments of the former sliould be studied on the dried skull, for it will have to be incised in the removal of the brain. That operation sliould now be performed, for which piu'pose divide the dura mater all round, on a level with'the section through the skull, and carry the scissors deeply between the hemispheres of the brain in front, to cut through the anterior part of the falx ; then draw the dura mater backwards, and leave it hanging by its attachment to the tentorium. Raise the anterior loljes of the brain carefullv with the hand, and lift the olfactoiy bulbs from the cribriform fossse with the handle of the scalpel. Then cut across the two optic nerves and internal carotid arteries. Next divide the infundibulum and third nerves, and carry the knife along the margin of the petrous bone at each side, so as to divide the tentorium near its attacnment. Cut across in succession the other pairs of cranial nerves with a sharp knife, and pass the scalpel as far down as possible into the vertebral canal, to sever the spinal cord, cutting first to one side, and then to the other, in order to divide the vertebral arteries and spinal accessory nerves. Then press the cerebellum gently upwards with the fingers of the right hand, the hemispheres being supported with the left, and the brain will roll into the hand. The arteries of the dura mater areâ€”the anterior meningeal from the ethmoidal, ophthalmic, and internal carotid ; the middle menin- geal and lesser meningeal from the internal maxillary ; the inferior meningeal from the ascending jiharyngeal and occipital arteries ; and the posterior meningeal from the vertebral. Its nerves are derived from the nervi molles and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, from the Gasserian ganglion, the oph- thalmic nerve, and from the foiirth and hypoglossal. The dnra mater is composed of two lamellas, endosteal and proi^er meningeal; the former adheres to the bones, the latter forms the internal processes, whilst the sinuses result from the separation of the two. It consists of interwoven bands of white fibrous tissue, with some admixture of elastic filires ; its inner surface is lined with flattened micleated endothelial cells. The space between the dura mater and arachnoid is called the sub- dural space ; it was formerly known as the cavity of the arachnoid. The arachnoid {apaxvr] eldos, like a spider's web) is a delicate membrane which invests the brain externally to the pia mater. On the upper surface of the hemispheres it is transparent, ljut may be demonstrated as it passes across the sulci from one convolution to another by injecting with a blow-pipe a stream of air lieneath it. At the base of the l)rain the membrane is opalescent and thicker than in other situations, and more easily demonstrable from the circumstance of sti'etching across the interA^al between the temporal lol)es of the hemispheres. The space which is included betAveen this layer of membrane and those parts of the base of the brain which are bounded by the optic commissure and fissures of Syl\'ius in front, and the pons Varolii behind, is termed the anterior stib-533 SUB-AIUCHNOID SPACES. arachnoid space. Another space formed in a similar manner between the under part of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata, is the posterior siib-arachnoid space; and a third space, situated over the corpora quadrigemina and corpus callosum, may be termed the supe- rior suh-arachnoid space. These spaces communicate freely with each other, the anterior and posterior across the crura cerebelli, the ante- rior and the superior around the crura cerebri, and the latter and the posterior across the cerebellum in the course of the vermiform processes. The posterior space comnnmicates by means of an open- ing called the foramen of Magendie with the cavity of the_ fourth ventricle ; and the anterior space has two small openings in its wall behind the roots of the glosso-pharyngeal nerves, which communicate with a pouch-like prolongation of the arachnoid beneath the flocculus. They communicate also with a still larger space formed by the loose disjDOsition of the arachnoid around the spinal cord, the spinal sub- arachnoid space. The whole of these spaces, with the lesser spaces between the convolutions of the hemispheres, constitute one large and continuous cavity which is filled with a limpid serous secretion, the sub-arachnoid or cerebrospinal fluid, a fluid which is necessary for the regulation of pressure, and protection of the cerebro-spinal mass. The arachnoid is connected to the pia mater by a delicate areolar tissue, which in the sub-arachnoid space is loose and filamen- tous. The serous secretion of the sub-dural space is very small in cpiantity as compared with the sub-arachnoid fluid. The arachnoid does not enter into the ventricles of the brain, but is reflected inwards upon the vense Galeni for a short distance only, and returns upon those vessels to the dura mater of the tentorium. It surrounds the nerves as they originate from the Ijrain, and forms a sheath around them to their point of exit from the skull. Vessels of considerable size, but few in number, and branches of cranial nerves, are found in the arachnoid. Structure.â€”The arachnoid cousists of interlacing bundles of tine fibrous tissue, the interstices of which are occupied Ij}^ spread-out cells. Its outer surface is covered by a layer of endothelium. On its inner surface it gives off mimerous bundles of fibres which form trabeculse and traverse the sub-arachnoid spaces ; both the surface of the membrane and the trabeculas are covered by endothelial cells. Cerebro-Spinal Fluid.â€”This is a limpid fluid, slightly alkaline in reaction, containing albumen, a trace of grape sugar, and the salts of the blood. The pia mater is an areolo-vascular membrane composed of in- numerable vessels held together by fine bundles of connective tissue. It invests the whole surface of the brain, dipping into the sulci be- t\\ ^een the convolutions, and forming a fold in its interior called velum interjoositum. It also forms folds in other situations, as in the third and fourth ventricles, and in the anterior fissure of the spinal cord. This membrane differs in structure in different parts of the cerebro-spinal axis. Thus, on the surface of the cerebrum, in contact with tlie soft grey matter of the brain, it is extremely vas-534 MEMBRANES OF THE SPINAL CORD. i cnlai', forming remarlcable loops of anaHtomosis in tlie interspaces of tlie convolutions, and distriljuting multitudes of minute straight vessels to the grey substance. In the substantia perforata, again, and locus perforatus, it gives off tufts of small arteries, which pierce the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. But upon the crura cerebri, pons Varolii, and spinal coi-d, its vascular character seems almost lost. It has become a dense fibrous membrane, difficult to tear off, and forming the ])roper sheath of tlie s])inal cord. The pia mater is the nutrient membrane of the bi'ain, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Lympha- tics have also been described as entering into its structure. Its nerves are the minute filaments of the sympathetic, and filaments from the sensory cranial nerves; they accompany the branches of the arteries. MEMBRANES OF THE SPINAL CORD. The dura mater spinalis is a cylindrical sheath of fibrous mem- l)rane, identical in structure with the dui'a mater of the skull, and continuous with that membrane. At the margin of the occipital fora- men it is closely adherent to the bone; by its an- terior surface it is attached to the posterior common ligament, and be- low, by means of its pointed ex- tremity, to the coccyx. In the rest of its extent it is compara- tively free, being separated from the vertebrae by loose areolar tissue and a plexus of veins. On either side and below, the dura mater forms a sheath for each of the spinal ner^'es, to which it is closely adherent. Upon its inner surface it is smooth, and on its sides may be seen double openings for the two roots of each of the spinal nerves.

It encloses the cord very loosely, being connected to it only by long slender filaments of areolar tissue, and by a longitudinal lamella ^\dlich is attached to the posterior aspect of the cord {aei^tum posticum). The areolar tissue is most abundant in the cervical region, and diminishes in quantity from above downwards; and the septum jDosticum is complete only in the dorsal region. The arachnoid jjasses off from the cord on either side with the spinal nerves, to which it forms a sheath. The space between the arachnoid and the pia mater is identical with that already described as existing between the same parts in the brain, the sub- arachnoid space. It is occupied by cerebro - sj)inal fluid, sufficient in quantity to expand the arachnoid, and fill completely the cavity of the dura mater. The sub-arachnoid or cerebrospinal fluid kee])s up a constant and gentle pressure on ihe entire surface of the brain and spinal cord, and yields with tlie greatest facility to the various movements of the cord. The pia mater is the immediate investment of the cord, and, like the other membi'anes, is continuous with that of the brain. It is not, however, like the pia mater cerebri, a vascular membrane, but is dense and fibrous in structure, and contains but few vessels. It invests the cord closely, and sends a fold into the anterior median fissure ; it is intimately connected with the neuroglia of the cord and with that occupying the jjosterior median fissure. It forms a sheath for each of the funiculi of the nerves, and for the nerves themselves ; and, inferiorly, at the conical termination of the cord, is prolonged downwards as a slender ligament (filuvi terminate), which descends through the centre of the cauda equina, and is attached to the dura mater lining the canal of the coccyx. This attachment is a rudiment of the original extpnsion of the spinal cord into the canal of the sacrum and coccyx. A longitudinal band of white fibres runs down the centre of the anterior aspect of the cord, and was called by Haller the linea splendens. The pia mater has, distributed to it, a number of nervous plexuses. The ligamentum denticulatum (ligamenium dentatum) is a thin process of pia mater sent oft' from each side of the cord throughout its entire lengtli, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of tbe spinal nerves. At its inner edge it is attached to the latei-al aspect of the cord, aud at its outer edge forms numerous saw-like processes or denticulations, the points of which are connected with the inner surface of the dura mater. The number of serrations on eacli side is about twenty, the first being situated on a level with the occipital foramen, and liaving the vertebral artery and h^qjoglossal Pig. 319.â€”Transverse section of the spinal cord aud its membranes.

Below tliis point the liganientum denticnlatuin is lost in the filum terminale of the pia mater. The denticulatioiis do not pierce the arachnoid, ljut are covered by funnel-like prolongations of that memljrane. The use of this meml^rane is to maintain the position of the spinal cord in the midst of the (iuid by whicli it is sui'rouuded. CEANIAL NEEVES. The PAIRS of cranial nerves are nine or twelve in nundjer, ac- cording as the arrangement of Willis or Soemmering is adopted. The following table shows their numbering according to both systems, and also gives the names by which the several nerves are known :â€” Name. Olfactory. Optic. Ocnlo-motor. Pathetic or trochlear.

FIRST PAIR.â€”OLFACTORY, The olfactory tract is more truly a lobe or offshoot of the brain than a cranial nerve ; it arises by three roots : an inner or short root from the inner and posterior part of the anterior lobe close to the substantia perforata ; a middle root from a papilla of grey matter {tuber olfadorium), embedded in the under surface of the frontal lobe, and an external or long root, which may be traced as a white streak along the fissure of Sylvius into the temporo-sphenoidal lol)o. The nervous cord formed by the miion of the three roots is soft in texture, prismoid in shape, and embedded in the olfactor}' sulcus ou the under surface of each anterior lobe of the brain, lying between the pia mater and arachnoid. As it passes forward it increases in breadth, and swells at its extremity into an oblong mass of grey and Willis. First. Second. Third. Fourth. Fifth. Sixth. Seventh Eighth. Ninth.

From the under surface of the olfactory bulb are given off tlie nerves which pass through the cribriform foramina, and supply the mucous membrane of the nares ; they are arranged into three groups : an inner group, which spread out upon the septum narium ; an outer group, which descend through bony canals in the outer wall of the nares, and are distributed on the superior and middle turbinated bones ; and a middle group, which supply the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal fossae.

The nerves are devoid of medullary sheath, and form frequent anastomoses with each other. SECOND PAIR.-OPTIC, This nerve consists of three parts : the optic tract, the 02dic chiasma, and the nerve proper. The first portion arises from the corpora geniculata on the posterior and inferior aspect of the thala- mus opticus, from the thalamus itself, and from the nates. Pro-538 CRANIAL NERVES. ceediiig' from this origin it winds around tlie cms cerebri a-s a flattened band, and joins with its fellow in front of the tubei- cine- renin to loi'ni tlie o'ptic conviuissure (chiasma). Tlie optic tract in united with the eras cerebri and tuber cinereum, and is covei-ed Ijy the ])ia mater ; the coniiuissure is also connected with the tuber cinereum, from which it receives fibres, and the nerve beyond the commissure diverges from its fellow, becomes rounded in form, and is enclosed in a sheath derived from the araclmoid, which is con- tinued upon it to the eyeball. In passing through the optic foramen the optic nerve receives a sheath from the dura mater, which splits at this point into two layers : one, which becomes the periosteum of the orbit; the other, the one in question, which foi-ms a sheath for the nerve, and is lost in the sclerotic coat of the eyeball. After a short course within the orbit the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats, and exjjands into the nervous membrane of the eyeball, the retina. Near the globe the nerve is pierced by a small artery, arteria centralis retinae, which runs through the central axis of the nerve and reaches the inner layers of the retina, to which it distributes branches. The optic commissure lies in a groo^^e in front of the olivary body of the sphenoid bone; is bounded by the lamina cinerea in front, by the substantia perforata at each side, and by the tuber cinereum behind. Within the commissure the innermost fibres of each optic nerve cross each other to pass to the eye of the opposite side ; the outer fibres continue their course uninterruptedly to the eye of the corresponding side. Some fibres pass in an arched direction from one nerve to the other behind, ancf others, taking a similar course in front, connect the two retinae. THIRD PAIR.â€”MOTORES OCULORUM. The motor oculi, a nerve of moderate size, arises from the inner side of the cms cerebri, close to the pons Varolii, and passes forward between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries. Its deep origin has been traced through the locus niger, to a grey nucleus beneath the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius and beneath the corpora quadrigemina. It pierces the dura mater immediately in front of the posterior clinoid process ; descends obliquely in the external waU of the cavernous sinus ; and divides into two branches which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and between the two heads of the external rectus muscle. The superior branch ascends, and supplies the superior rectus and levator palpebrse. The inferior sends a branch beneath the optic nerve to the internal rectus, another to the inferior rectus, and a long branch to the inferior oblique muscle. From the latter a short thick branch is given to the ophthalmic ganglion, forming its inferior root. _ The brandies of the third nerve enter the muscles on their ocular side. In the cavernous sinus it receives one or two filaments from the carotid plexus, and one from the ophthalmic nerve.539 FOUKTH AND FIFTH NERVES. FOURTH PAIRâ€”PATHETICI (trochlearis). The fourtli is the smallest cerebral nerve ; it arises from a nucleus beneath that of the third nerve in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius ; it passes across the outer border of the ^'alve of Vieussens, and wind- ing around the crus cerebri to the extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, pierces the dura mater below the third nerve, and passes forward in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus to the sphenoidal fissure. In its course in the outer wall of the sinus it is situated at first below the motor oculi, but afterwards ascends and becomes the highest of the ner\'es entering tlie orbit by the sphenoidal fissure. On entering the orbit the nerve crosses the levator palpe- brae muscle near its origin, and is distributed on the orbital surface of the superior oblique or trochlearis muscle; hence its synonym trochlearis. The fibres of origin of the two nerves communicate with each other, forming a kind of commissure, on the ujjper surface of the valve of Vieussens. Branches.â€”Wliile in the cavernous sinus the fourth nerve gives off a recurrent branch, and sends a branch of communication to the ophthalmic nerve ; the recurrent brcmch, consisting of sympathetic filaments derived from the carotid plexus, passes backwards between the layers of the tentorium, and divides into two or three filaments, which are distributed to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. FIFTH PAIR.â€”TRIFACIAL (trigeminus). The fifth nerve, the great sensitive nerve of the head and face, and the largest cranial nerve, is analogous to the spinal nerves in its origin by two roots from the anterior and posterior columns of the spinal cord, and in the existence of a ganglion on the posterior root. It arises, or rather makes its appearance at the surface of the brain, on the anterior part of the lateral and constricted jjortion of the pons Varolii, and consists of a large and small fasciculus, separated by a narrow interspace, the larger fasciculus being the jwsterior or sensory root; the smaller one, the anterior or motor root. The sensory root is composed of from seventy to a hundred filaments each enclosed in a sheath of pia mater, and the entire bundle is bound together into a single nerve and connected with the motor root by a sheath of arachnoid membrane. The nerve then passes through an oval opening in the border of the tentorium, near the extremity of the petrous hone, and spreads out into a large semilunar ganglion, the Gasserian. If the ganglion be turned over, it will be seen that the anterior root lies against its under surface without having any connection with it, and may Ije followed onwards to the inferior maxillary nerve. The Gasserian ganglion divides into three branchesâ€”ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. Deep Origin.â€”The motor root arises'(i) from a nucleus in theS40 CRANIAL NERVES. i tioor of tlie fourtli ventiiclc, iiuiuediately Ijelow tlie lateral rece.>.s and (2) from grey matter in the sides of the Sylvian aqueduct ((h- scendiny root). The sensory root springs (i) from a long nucleus placed beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle and extending into the medulla in tlie region of the funiculus cuneatus (ascendinrj root). and (2) fi'om the nerve cells of the formatio reticularis in the medulla and pons. The OPHTHALMIC NERVE is the nerve of sensation of the eyel)all, lachrymal gland, mucous membrane of the eye and nose, integuirieut of the forehead and nose, and muscles of the eyebrow and foreliead. It arises from the upper part of the Gasserian ganglion by a short trunk, about three-quarters of an inch in length ; passes forwards iu the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, lying externally to the other nerves, and divides into three 1)ranches. Previously to its division it receives several filaments from the carotid plexus, and gives off a small recurrent nerve, which passes backwards with the recurrent branch of the fourth nerve between the two layers of the tentorium to the lin- ing membrane of lateral sinus. The branches of the ophthalmic nerve are theâ€” Frontal, Lachrymal, Nasal. The frontal nerve enters the orbit imme- diately to the outer side of the fourth nerve, and passing forwards, for some distance, upon the leA'ator palpebrae muscle, divides into a supra-orbital and supra-troclilear branch.

The nasal nerve enters the orbit between the two heads of the external rectus and between the two branches of the third nerve. It Fio. 323.â€”Nerves of the orbit seen from tlie outer side. i.

It then passes through the slit-like opening by the side of the crista galli, and descends into the nose, where it divides into an internal and external branch. The internal branch is dis- tributed to the mucous membrane ; tlie external branch, passingSUPEEIOK MAXILLARY NEEVE. 543 outwcords between the nasal bone and cartilage, supplies the integii- ment of the exterior of the nose as far as its tip. The branches of the nasal nerve aTeâ€”ga7ujlionic, ciliary, and infra-trochlear. The ganglionic branch, about half an inch in length and of small size, enters the upper angle of the ophthalmic ganglion, and consti- tutes its superior or long root. It is often joined by the sympathetic root of the ganglion derived from the cavernous plexus. The long ciliary branches are two or three filaments given off from the nerve as it crosses the optic nerve. They pierce the sclerotic coat near the short ciliary nerves, and passing through the globe of the eye between the sclerotic and choroid, are distributed to the iris. The infra-trochlear branch is given off close to the anterior in- ternal orbital foramen. It passes forward along the upjDer border of the internal rectus to the inner angle of the eye, where it com- municates with the supra-trochlear nerve, and is distributed to the lachrymal sac and inner angle of the orbit. The SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE, larger than the preceding, is the nerve of sensation of the teeth of the upper jaw, the hard and soft palate, tonsils, antrum maxillare, and muscles and integument of the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip. Proceeding from the middle of the Gasserian ganglion, it passes forward through the foramen rotundum, crosses the spheiio-maxillary fossa, and enters the canal in the floor of the orbit, along which it runs to the infra- orbita,l foramen. Emerging on the face, beneath the levator labii superioris muscle, it becomes the infra-orhital nerve, and divides into palpebral, nasal, and labial branches, which form a plexus with the facial nerve. The branches of the superior maxillary nerve are divisible into three groups : namely, those given off in the splieno-maxillary fossa ; 4 those given off in the infra-orbital canal; and those given off on the i| face. They may be thus arranged :â€” i i Orbital, or temjDoro-malar, Spheno-maxillary fossa . . < Si^heno-palatine, ( Posterior dental. Infra-orbital canal . . 1 Middle dental, \ Anterior dental. ( Palpebral, On the face } Nasal, ( Labial. The orbital branch enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two brandies, temporal and malar ; the femporal branch ascends along the outer Avail of the orbit, and after receiving a branch from the lachrymal nerve, passes through a canal in the malar bone, and enters the temporal fossa ; it then pierces the temporal muscle and fascia, and is distributed to the integument of the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with theCRANIAL NERVES. 544 facial and aunculo-temporal nerves. In the temporal fossa it com municates with the dec]) temporal nerves. Tlie malar, or inferior branch (subcutaneous malce) takes its course along tlie lower aiialc oi the outer wall of the orbit, and emerges on the cheek tlirougli ai, opening m the malai- Ijone, passing between tlie filn-es of the orlncu- hu-is palpebrarum muscle. It communicates with branches of the intra-orbital and facial nerve. The spheno-palatine branches, two in number, pass downward- to the spheuo-palatine oi' Meckel's ganglion. The posterior dental branches, two in number, pass downwards upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, where one entei s Pio. 324. â€” Pterygo- maxillary region and fifth nerve, i.

The middle and anterior dental branches descend to the corre- sponding teeth and gums ; the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. Previously to their distribution, the dental nerves form a plexus in the outer wall of the su]ierior maxillary bone immediately above the alveolus. From tliis plexus filaments are given off M'liicn supply the pulps of the teeth, gums, mucous membrane of the floorINFEKIOK MAXILLARY NEEVE. 545 of the nares, and palate. Small ganglia have been described in connection with this plexus, one being placed over the canine, another over the second molar tooth ; the former has been named the ganglion of Bochdalelc. The palpebral branches are given off from the infra-orbital as it issues from the infra-orbital foramen; they turn upwards to the eyelid and are distributed to the skiii, conjunctiva, and orbicularis palpebrarum (sensory supply). The nasal branches pass inwards between the fibres of the levator labii superioris alteque nasi to be distributed to the skin of the side of the nose and the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles (sensory supply). The labial branch lies on the levator anguli oris, and divides into branches for the skin of the cheek, mucous membrane of the upper lip, and muscles of the upper lip (sensory sujD^^ly)- The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE is a nerve both of sensation and motion, and is distributed to the teeth and gums of the lower jaw, to the tip and sides of the tongue, to the integument of the temple, external ear, lower part of the face and lower lip, and to the muscles of mastication. Its sensory root proceeds from the inferior angle of the Gasserian ganglion, is the largest of the three sensory divisions of the fifth nerve, and is increased in size by the anterior or motor root, which, passing behind the ganglion, unites with it as it escapes through the foramen ovale. Emerging at the foramen ovale the nerve divides into two trunks, anterior and j)osterior, separated from each other by the external ptery- goid muscle ; the anterior division is almost entirely motor, but its buccal branch is believed to be in chief part sensory ; the posterior division is sensory, b\it the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental is motor. The anterior division, into which may be traced nearly the whole of the motor root, immediately se^iarates into five or six liranches, distributed to the muscles of the temporo-maxillary region ; they areâ€”masseteric, temporal, buccal, internal pterygoid, and external pterygoid. The masseteric branch passing over the external pterygoid muscle, and behind the tendon of the temporal, crosses the sigmoid notch with the masseteric artery to the niasseter muscle. It sends a filament to the temporo-maxillary articulation, and frequently a small branch to the temporal muscle. Tlie deep temporal branches, two in number, anterior and posterior, pass between the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle and the temporal bone to the temporal muscle. Two or three filaments from these nerves pierce the temporal fascia, and 'ommunicate with the lachrymal, subcutaneus malte, superficial ii'inporal and faciaVnerves. The buccal branch is of large size, and pierces the lower fibres of the external pterygoid muscle at its anterior part; it runs down- wards and forwards in close contact with the inner surface of the tendon of the temporal muscle aud accompanied by the bucca 2 MCRANIAL NERVES. 546 brancli of the internal maxillary artery. It sends a Ijrancli to the external pterygoid muscle, and is distrilnited to the buccinator and mucous membrane and integument of the clieek, communicating with the facial nerve. The internal pterygoid brancli is a long and slender nerve which passes inwards to tlie internal pterygoid muscle, and enters it on its deep surface. This nerve is remarkable for its connection with the otic ganglion, to which it is closely adherent. The external pterygoid branch is commonly derived from the buccal nerve. The posterior division of the inferior maxillary nerve splits into three branchesâ€” Auriculo-temporal, Inferior dental, Lingual. The AURICULO-TEMPORAL NERVE originates by two roots, be- tween which the middle meningeal artery takes its course, and passes directly backwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw. It then ascends between that articulation and the meatus auris, and, escaping from beneath the parotid gland, divides into two temporal Ijranches. While behind the temporo-maxillary articulation, it forms a kind of plexus, and sends off several branches. Its branches areâ€”a small branch to the temporo-maxillary articu- lation ; two or three to the parotid gland ; two to the meatiis aurLs, Avliich enter the canal between the fibro-cartilage and jjrocessus auditorius ; two auricular branches to the pinna ; a communicating branch to the otic ganglion; two communicating branches to the facial nerve, and the tempoi'al branches. The auricular branches, superior and inferior, are distributed to the pinna above and below the meatus. The inferior brancli communicates with the sympathetic. The branches which communicate with the facial nerve embrace the external carotid artery in their course. The temporal branches are anterior and posterior : the anterior accompanies the anterior temporal artery, and supplies the integu- ment of the temporal region, communicating with branches of the facial, supra-orbital, subcutaneus malse, and lachrymal nerves ; the posterior is distributed to the upper part of the jDinna, attrahens auriculam muscle, and integument of the posterior -part of the temple. The INFERIOR DENTAL NERVE, the largest of the three branches of the ]30sterior division of the inferior maxillary, passes downwards with the inferior dental artery, at first between the two ijterj'-goid muscles, then between the internal lateral ligament and ramus of the lower jaw to the dental foramen, next it runs along the canal in the inferior maxillary bone, distributing branches to the teeth and gums, and divides into two terminal branches, incisive and mental. The branches of the inferior dental nerve, besides those given to the teeth, are the mylo-hyoid and the two terminal branches. The mylo-hyoid branch leaves the nerve just as it is about toLINGUAL NERVE. 547 enter the dental foramen ; it then pierces the insertion of the in- ternal lateral ligament, and descends along a groove in the bone to the inferior snrface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, to which, and to the anterior belly of the digastricus, it furnishes the motor sujjply. The incisive branch is continued forward to the symphysis of the jaw, to supply the incisor teeth. The mental or labial branch emerges from the jaw at the mental foramen, beneath the depressor anguli oris, and divides into branches Avhich supply the muscles (sensory supply) and integument of the loM'er lip and cliin, and communicate with the facial nerve. The LINGUAL NERVE (gustatory) descends between the two ptery- goid muscles, and makes a gentle curve forwards to the side of the tongue, along which it takes its course to the tip. On the side of the tongue it is flattened, and gives off numerous branches, which are distributed to the mucous membrane and j)apilla3. In the upper part of its course the lingual nerve lies between the external pterygoid muscle and the pharynx, next between the two pterygoid muscles, then between the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, crosses the ujij^er border of the superior constrictor of the pharynx, and runs between the stylo-glossus muscle and the submaxillary gland ; lastly, it runs along the side of the tongue, resting against the hyo-glossus muscle and crossing the duct of the submaxillar}'- gland, and lies between the mylo-hyoid muscle and the miicous membrane of the floor of the mouth. The lingual nerve, while between the pterygoid muscles, often receives a communicating bi'anch from the inferior dental; lower down it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tymj)ani, a small nerve, which, arising from the facial in the aqueductus Fallopii, crosses the tympanum, and escapes from that cavity through the canal of Huguier at the inner end of the fissure of Glaser. Having joined the lingual nerve, the chorda tympani is continued down- wards in its sheath to the submaxillary ganglion and tongue. One or two branches are given by the lingual nerve to the submaxillary ganglion. On the hyo-giossus muscle several branches of communication join with branches of the hypoglossal nerve, and others are sent to the sublingual gland, Wharton's duct, and mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. SIXTH PAIR.-ABDUCENTES. The abducens nerve, about half the size of the motor oculi, arises by several filaments from the groove between the anterior pyramid and the pons Varolii. Proceeding forwards from this origin, it lies parallel with the basilar artery, and, piercing the dura mater low down on the side of the basilar process of the sphenoid bone, ascends between the two layers of that membrane to the cavernous sinus. It then runs forward on the outer wall of the sinus, below â– .he level of the other nerves and resting against the internal carotid irtery, to the sphenoidal fissure. Entering the orbit through the548 CRANIAL NERVES. splienoidal fissure it passes between the two heads of the external rectus, and is distributed to that muscle. At the sphenoidal lissui-e it lies upon tlie ophthalmic vein, from wliicli it is separated by a lamina of dura mater ; and in the cavernous sinus is joined b several fihxments from the carotid plexus. Deep Origin.â€”Underneath the fasciculus teres in tlie floor of the fourth ventricle, immediately above the striae acusticse. SEVENTH PAIR. The seventh and eighth pairs of nerves consist of two nervous cords which lie side by side on the posterior border of the crus cerebelli in the groove between the olivary and restiform Ijodies. The smaller and most internal of these, and at the same time the most dense in texture, is the seventh {facial nerve or 2^ortio dura). The external nerve, which is soft and pulpy, and often grooved by contact with the preceding, is the eighth or auditory nerve (portio mollis). A third nerve of small size, portio intermedia of Wrisberg, is brought into view by separating these two cords. It arises from the same nucleus as the auditory nerve, and generally joins the facial nerve where the two lie together in the internal audi- tory meatus. Some observers state that it is continued into the chorda tympani nei-ve l^eyond the gangliform enlargement of the facial. FACIAL OR SEVENTH NERVE (pDrtio dura).â€”The facial nerve, the motor nerve of the face, arises from the upper part of the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies, close to the lower edge of the i^ons Varolii; its deep origin being traced to the for- matio reticularis of the pons, beneath the floor of the fom-th ventricle. The nerve jDasses forward, resting on the crus cerebelli, and comes into relation with the auditory nerve, with which it enters the meatus auditorius internus, lying at first to the inner side of, and then upon that nerve. At the bottom of the meatus, the facial nerve enters the aqueductus Fallopii, and takes its course forwards to the hiatus Fallo])ii, in the anterior wall of the petrous bone, where it forms a gangliform swelling (intumescentia gangli- formis, geniculate ganglion), and receives the petrosal Ijranch of the Vidian nerve. It tlien runs aloug the inner wall of the tym- panum, and descends behind the pyramid and tympanic cavity to the stylo-mastoid foramen. Emerging at the stylo-mastoid foramen, it passes forwards within the parotid gland, crossing the external carotid artery, to the ramus of the lower jaw, where it splits into two trunks, temporo-facial and cervico-facial. These trunks divide into numerous branches, which escape from the anterim border of the parotid gland, and are distributed in a radiated manner over the side of the face, from the temple to IteloAV tlu' lower jaw; on the masseter muscle the branches communicate au'l form loops, and the whole arrangement over the side of the fate has been termed pes anserinus.549 FACIAL NERVE. Communications.â€”In tlie meatus auditorius, tlie facial nerve communicates with the auditory nerve by one or two filarrients ; the intumescentia gangliformis is connected with the greater and. lesser petrosal nerves, and sends a twig hack to the auditory nerve; at the back of the tympanum, the nerve receives one or two twigs from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric; at its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen it receives a twig from the glosso-pha- ryngeal, and in the parotid gland one or two large branches from the auriculo-temporal nerve. Besides these, the facial nerve has numerous peripheral communications, with the branches of the tifth nerve on the face, with the cervical nerves in the parotid gland and on the neck, and with the sympathetic. Tlie branches of the facial nerve areâ€” The tympanic branch is a small filament given off by the facial â– while in the petrous bone, and distributed to the stapedius muscle. The chorda tympani quits the facial immediately above the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends by a distinct canal to the upper part of the posterior wall of the tympanum, where it enters that cavity through an opening situated between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested by mucous membrane. It then crosses the tympanum between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus to its anterior inferior angle, and escapes through an opening at the inner end of the fissure of Glaser (canal of Huguier), to join the lingual branch of the fifth at an acute angle between the two pterygoid muscles. Enclosed in the sheath of the lingual nerve, it descends to the sub- maxillary gland, where part of it ends in the submaxillary ganglion; the rest is continued onwards with the filaments of the lingual, to be distributed to the tongue. The origin of the chorda tympani has long been a subject of dis- cussion, some observers regarding it as derived from the intermediary nerve of Wrisberg, others considering it as traceable through the greater and lesser petrosal nerves to the sj)heno-palatine and otic ganglia ; latterly, there has been a growing opinion in favour of its origin from the communicating branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which joins the facial nerve at the stylo-mastoid foramen. The posterior auricular branch ascends behind the ear, be- tween the meatus and mastoid process, and divides into an anterior or auricular, and a posterior or occipital branch. The auricular branch receives a filament of communication from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve, and distributes filaments to the5so CRANIAL NERVES. vcjti'iiliens ixuriculiiiii imiscle and pinna. The occipital branch com- numicates with tlie ani'icularis niagnus and occipitalis minor, and is distributed to the occi})ital portion of tlie occijjito-frontalis.

The digastric branch supplies the posterior belly of the digas- tricus muscle, and communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and ii I 31 15 Fig. 325.â€”Nerves of the face and scalp, i.

The TEMPORO-FACIAL DIVISION, while in the parotid gland, sends a branch of communication along the carotid artery to theAUDITORY NERVE. 551 cauriculo-teniporal nerve, and divides into temporal, malar, and infra-orbital branches. The temporal branches ascending upon the temporal region supply the attrahens auriculam, occipito-frontalis, and orbicularis palpebrarum ; and communicate with the supra-orbital nerve and temporal branch of the superior maxillary. The malar branches cross the malar bone to the outer angle of the eye, and supply the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator super- cilii, and eyelids. They communicate with the subcutaneus malse branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and with branches of the ophthalmic nerve in the eyelids. The infra-orbital branches cross the masseter muscle, and are distributed to the buccinator, elevator muscles of the upper lip, and orbicularis oris. They communicate with the terminal branches of the infra-orbital nerve, infra-trochlear, and nasal nerve. Two or more of these branches are found by the side of Stenson's duct. The CERVICO-FACIAL DIVISION, smaller than the temporo-facial, communicates in the parotid gland with the auricularis magnus I nerve, and divides into branches which admit of arrangement into I three sets : buccal, supra-maxillary, and infra-maxillary. The buccal branches pass forward across the masseter muscle i towards the mouth, and distribute branches to the orbicularis oris t and buccinator. They communicate with branches of the tem- j poro-facial, and with the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The supra-maxillary branches are destined to the muscles of the lower lip, and take their course along the body of the lower jaw. Beneath the depressor anguli oris, they have a plexiform communi- cation Avith the inferior dental nerve. The infra-maxillary branches take their course below the lower b jaw, pierce the deep cervical fascia, and are distributed to the platysma, J communicating with the superficialis colli nerve. EIGHTH NERVE. Auditory Nerve (portio mollis).â€”The auditory nerve takes its origin in the floor of the fourth ventricle from two nucleiâ€”one in the tuberculum acusticum at the outer side of the inferior fovea, the other in the lateral recess. It winds around the restiform body, from which it receives fibres, to the posterior border of the crus cerebelli. It then passes forward on the crus cerebelli in company with the facial nerve, which lies in a groove on its superior sur- face, enters the meatus auditorius internus, and at the bottom of the meatus divides into two branches, cochlear and vestibular. The distribution of these branches will be found described with the anatomy of the internal ear. The auditory nerve is soft and pulpy in texture, and receives in the meatus auditorius several filaments from the facial nerve.552 CRANIAL NERVES. Fio. 326.â€”I. Posterior auricular artery. 2.

The glosso-pharyngeal nerve, as its name implies, is the nerve of sensation of the mncous membrane of the tongiie and pharynx, but it also gives branches to some of the muscles of these organs. It arises by five or six filaments from the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies, and escapes from the skull at the innermost extremity of the jugular foramen through a distinct opening in the dura mater, lying anteriorly to the sheath of the pnenmogastric and spinal accessory nerves, and internally to the jugular vein. It then passes forward between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and crosses the artery to reach the posterior border of the stylo- pharyngeus. Following the posterior border of this muscle for a short distance, it next passes across it and the middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus muscle, to be distributed to the mucous mem- brane of the tongue, pharynx, and tonsil. Deep Origin.â€”Beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle, above the nucleus of the vagus and below that of the auditory nerve. Wliile in the jugular fossa, it presents two gangliform swellings : one superior, the jugular ganglion, of small size, and involving only the posterior fibres of the nerve; the other inferior, nearly half an inch below the preceding, of larger size, and occupying the whole diameter of the nerve, the petrous ganglion or ganglion of Andersch. The branches of the glosso-pliaryngeal nerve are branches of communication and branches of distribution. The branches of communication proceed chiefly from the gan- glion of Anderscli ; they areâ€”one to join the auricular branch of the pnenmogastric ; one to the ganglion of the root of the pnenmo- gastric ; one to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and one, which arises below the ganglion and pierces the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, to join the facial nerve. The branches of distribution areâ€” The tympanic branch (Jacobson's nerve) proceeds from the ganglion of Andersch, or hom the trunk of the nerve immediately above the ganglion ; it enters a small bony canal between the jugular fossa and carotid foramen (p. 99), and divides into six branches, which are distributed on the inner wall of the tympanmn, and establish a plexiform communication (tympanic plexus) with the sympathetic and fifth pair of nerves. The branches of distribu- tion supply the fenestra rotunda, fenestra ovalis, and Eustachian NINTH NERVE. Tympanic, Carotid, Muscular, Pharyngeal, Tonsillitic, Lingual.554 OKANIAL NE1WE8.

The carotid branches are several filaments which follow the trunk of the internal carotid artery, and communicate with the nervi molles of the sympathetic and pharyngeal branch of the pueumogastric. _ The muscular branch divides into filaments, which are distri-1* buted to the stylo-pharyngeus, and constrictor muscles. â– > .'JrC?)^ The pharyngeal branches are two or three filaments which are distributed to the pharynx and unite with the pharyngeal branches of the pueumogastric, external laryngeal, and sympathetic nerves to form the pharyngeal plexus. The tonsillitic branches proceed from the glosso-pharyngeal â– nerve, near its termination; they form a plexus (circukis tonsil- laris) around the base of the tonsil, from which numerous filaments are given ofl^ to the mucous membrane of the fauces and soft palate. These filaments communicate with the descefnding palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. The lingual branches enter the substance of the tongue beneath the hyo-glossus and stylo-glossus muscle, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the side and base of the tongue, and to tlie epiglottis and fauces. TENTH NERVE. The pneumogastric or vagus nerve is the nerve of the re- spiratory organs and upper part of the alimentary canal, supplying liranches to the larynx, trachea, lungs, pharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, and also giving branches to the heart. It arises by ten or fifteen filaments from the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies, immediately below the glosso-pharyngeal, and passes out of tlie skull through the inner extremity of the jugular foramen, enclosed in a sheath of dura mater common to it and the spinal accessory. The nerve then takes its course down the side of the neck, lying at first between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and lower down behind and between that vein and the common carotid artery and enclosed in the same sheath. At the root of the neck the course of the nerve on the two sides is diff'erent. The right nerve enters the chest by passing between the subclavian artery and vein, and descends by the side of the trachea to the pos- terior part of the root of the right lung ; it then proceeds as a double cord along the posterior aspect of the oesophagus to the corresponding556 CKANIAL NERVES. side oi' 1-lie stoinacli ; tlie two coi'dn reiuiitiiig at tlie lower ])ai-t of the (xsopliagus. Tlie left nerve enters tlie cliest between tlie leii common carotid and subclavian artery lying behind the left vena innominata; it then crosses the ai-ch of tlie aorta, and reaches the posterior part of the root of the left Inng, whence it descends, bv one or two cords, along the anterior aspect of the oesophagus to tLi front part of the stomach. In the jugular foramen, the pneumogastric nerve presents a small round ganglion, the superior ganglion or ganglion of the root; and immediately aftei' its exit a ganglifoi'iii swelling, neai'ly an incli in length, the inferior ganglion ov ganglion of the trunk. Deep Origin.â€”The iibres of origin of the pneumogastric ner\c may be traced to a mass of nerve cells placed beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle, Ijelow the nucleus of the glosso-pharyngeal, and extending down to the calamus scriptorius. The branches of the pneumogastric nerve are branches of com- munication and branches of distribution. The branches of comniunication proceed from the ganglia; from the superior ganglion one or two branches jjass to the spinal accessory ; one or two to the superior ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one to the inferior ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. From the inferior ganglion there pass off branches to the hy|Doglossal, branches to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and branches to the loop between the first and second cervical nerve. The branches of disfribution areâ€” Meningeal, Anterior jDulmonary, Auricular, Posterior pulmonary. Pharyngeal, CEsophageal, Superior laryngeal. Gastric. Cardiac, Inferior or recurrent laryngeal. ^ The meningeal or recurrent is a small branch given off from the ganglion of the root; it passes backwards to be distributed to the dura mater of the posterior fossa of the skull. The auricular branch (Arnold's nerve) is given off from the lower part of the ganglion of the root, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately below it, and receives immediately after its origin a small branch of comniunication from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes outwards behind the jugulai- vein, and at the outer side of that vessel enters a small canal (p. 99) in the jugular fossa of the temporal bone. Guided bv that canal it reaches the descending part of the aqueductus Fallopii and communicates with the facial nerve ; it then passes outwards through a small fissure situated between the mastoid process and external auditory process (auditory fissure), and reaching the surface of the bone communicates with the posterior auricular nerve ana is distributed to the back part of the pinna and auditory canal. The pharyngeal nerve arises from the upper part of the ganglionVAGUS NEEVE. 557 of the trunk, and crosses behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, nijon which it forms the pharyngeal plexus assisted by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, suj)erior laryngeal, and sympathetic. One small branch, called, the Ungual branch of the vagus, is derived from the pharyngeal branches of this nerve and the glosso-pharyn- geal ; it joins the hypo- glossal nerve, as that trunk winds round the occipital artery, and is distributed with it. Tlie pharyngeal plexus is distributed to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The superior laryn- geal nerve arises from the ganglion of the trunk, and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the thyro- hyoid membrane, through which it j^asses with the superior lar- yngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx, communi- cating with the inferior laryngeal nerve. Be- liind the internal caro- tid it gives off the external laryngeal branch, which sends a twig to the pharyngeal plexus, and then de- scends to supply the inferior constrictor, ci'ico - thyroid muscle and thyroid gland. This branch communicates inferiorly with Uie superior cardiac nerve and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic.

Those from above communicate with cardiac branches of the sympathetic. One large branch {inferior cardiac) is given off just before tlie nerxc enters the chest ; on the right this branch descends by the side of the arteria innominata to the deep cardiac plexus ; on the left it passes in front of the arch of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. One or two cardiac branches also proceed from the thoracic ]Jortion of the right pneumogastric nerve and end in the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior, or recurrent larnygeal nerve, curves around tlic subclavian artery on the right, and the arch of the aorta on the left side. It ascends in the groove between the trachea antl oesophagus, and piercing the lower fibres of the inferior constrictoi' muscle enters the larynx close to the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage. It is distributed to all the muscles of the larjaix, with the exception of the crico-thyroiil, and communicates with the superior laryngeal nerve. As it cur\ e.s around the subclavian artery and aorta it gives branches (cardiac) to the dee]) cardiac plexus and root of the lungs ; and as it ascends the neck it distributes filaments to the cesophagus and trachea, and communicates with the external laryngeal nerve and symiDathetic. The anterior pulmonary branches, two or three in number, arc disti'ibuted upon the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs, form- ing, with branches from the cardiac plexuses, the anterior pulmonani plexus. The posterior pulmonary branches, more numerous and larger than the anterior, are distributed on the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs ; they are joined l)y filaments from the third and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and form the posterior pulmonary plexus. CEsophageal branches are given off by the pneumogastric nerve? . above the root of the lungs; below that point, the trunks of the nerves, divided into several cords, form a plexus aroimd the ooso- phagus, the right and left nerves communicating with each othei'. This plexus accompanies the oesophagus to the stomach, and is the oesophageal plexus (plexus gula^). The gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the pneumo- gastric nerves ; they are spread out upon the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, and ai'e likewise distributed to the omen- tum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder. The branches of the anterior aspect of tlie stomach proceed from the left nerve and com- municate with the hepatic plexus in the lesser omentum ; those of the posterior aspect are derived from the right nerve and com- municate Avith the solar plexus.SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. 559 ELEVENTH NERVE.

The accessory portion arises from the lateral aspect of the medulla, immediately Ijelow the vagus ; its fibres being traceable through the medulla to a grey nucleus in the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The two jjortions lie together, in the same compartment of the jugular foramen as the vagus, and often become intimately united so as to form a short trunk. Immediately after leaAdng the foramen the accessory portion of the nerve joins the ganglion of the trank of the vagus, and probably endows that nerve with motor power. The spinal jiortion is continued downwards behind, but sometimes in front of, the internal jugular vein, to the upper and deep part of the sterno-mastoid, pierces that muscle obliquely, and descends across the posterior triangle of the neck to the deep surface of the trapezius, to which it is distributed, its branches being continued downwards to near the lower border of the muscle. In the substance of the sterno-mastoid it communicates witli branches of the cervical plexus, and in the posterior triangular space with the third and fourth cervical nerves. TWELFTH NERVE. HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE.â€”The hypoglossal is a nerve of motion, distributed to all the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, the geuio-hyoid and the thyro-hyoid. It arises from the groove between the anterior pyramid and olivary body by ten or fifteen filaments, which are col- lected into two bundles, and escape from the cranium through the anterior condylar foramen. At its exit from tlie cranium, the nerve lies behind the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, then passing forward between the artery and vein it descends to a point parallel with the angle of the lower jaw. It next cuim ? forward around the occipital artery, with which it forms a loop, and crossing the external carotid and lower part of the hyo-glossus muscle to the genio-hyo-glossus, sends filaments onwards with â–  the anterior fibres of that muscle as far as the tip of the tongue. f While resting on the hyo-glossus muscle it is flattened, and lie- jj neath the mylo-hyoid communicates with the lingual branch of the fifth nerve. _ At its origin, the hypoglossal nerve sometimes communicates with the posterior root of the first cervical nerve. Its deep origin may be traced to one of the nuclei of grey substance, in the floor of the fourth ventricle, whei-e it decussates with its fellow of tlie o]iiio- site side. I561 HYPOGLOSSAL NEEVE. The branches of the hypoglossal nerve areâ€”branches of communi- cation and branches of distribution. The branches of communication of the hypoglossal nerve areâ€” several to the pnenmogastric, with which nerve it is closely united ; one or two with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one or two with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves. The branches of distribution areâ€” Descendens cervicis, Tliyro-hyoid, Muscular. The descendens cervicis (descendens noni) is a long and slender nerve, which quits the hypoglossal just as it is about to form its arch around the occipital artery, and descends on the sheath of the carotid vessels. Just below the middle of the neck it forms a looj) {ansa hypoglossi) with the commnnicans cervicis, derived from the second and third cervical nerves. From the convexity of this loop branches are sent to the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and both Fig. 330.â€”Anatomy of the side of the neck, showing the nerves of the tongue. I. Temporal bone. 2.

The descendens cervicis probably arises from the upper cervical nerves, and is only temporarily associated with the hypoglossal (Luschka); this view receives confirmation from the fact that in 2 N562 WPINAL NERVES. some instances it accompanies the vagus instead of the hypoglossal and m others is absent, tlie entire disti-ibution taking place through the comnmnicans cervicis. In yet another set of cases, the de- scendens supplies the place of the communicans, which Ls otherwise unrepresented. The thyro-hyoid nerve is a small branch distributed to the thyro- hyoid muscle. It is given off by the trunk of the hypoglossal neai- the posterior border of the hyo-glossus, and descends obliquely over the great cornu of the os hyoides. According to HoU, this nerve is really derived from the upper cervical nerves. The muscular branches are given off where the nerve is covered by the mylo-liyoid muscle, and rests on the hyo-glossus ; several large branches take their course across the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus to reach the substance of the tongue. They are distributed to the hyo-glossus, genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, and stylo-glossus muscles. On the hyo-glossus muscle, the branches of the hy])oglossal new- communicate with those of the lingual branch of the fifth nerve. SPINAL NERVES. There are thirty-one paii's of spinal nerves, each arising by two roots, an anterior or motor root, and a posterior or sensory root. The anterior roots proceed from the anterior lateral sulcus, which marks the division of the anterior from the posterior jjart of the antero-lateral column of the sj)inal cord, and gradually approacli towards the anterior median fissure as they descend. The posterior roots, more regular than the anterior, proceed from the posterior lateral sulcus ; they are larger, and the filaments of origin more numerous than those of the anterior roots ; and in tlie intervertebral foi'amina there is a ganglion on each of their roots. The first cervical ner^^e forms an exception to these characters ; its posterior root is smaller than the anterior ; it often joins, in whole or in part, the spinal accessory nerve, and sometimes the hypoglossal; it has frequently no ganglion, and when the ganglion exists, it is often situated within the dura mater, the latter Ijeing the usual position also of the ganglia of the last tAvo pairs of spinal nerves. After the formation of a ganglion, the two roots unite, and con- stitute a spinal nerve, which escapes through the intervertebral foramen, and sej^arates into an anterior division for the saijjjly of the front aspect of the body, and a posterior division for the poste- rior aspect. In the first cervical, last sacral, and coccygeal nei've this division takes place within the dura mater; and in the upper four sacral nerves, externally to that cavity, but Avithin the sacral canal. The anterior cords, with the exception of the first two cervical nerves, are larger than the posterior ; an arrangement which is pro- portioned to the larger extent of surface they are required to supply.SPINAL NERVES. 563 Both divisions are compoundâ€”that is to say, they contain both motor and sensory filaments.

Point of Exit of the Spinal Nerves.â€”The roots of the spinal nerves run obliquely downwards from the part of the cord from which each springs to the intervertebral foramen by which it emerges from the canal. The degree of obliquity varies in difterent regions, being greatest in the lumbar and sacral nerves, and least in the dorsal. The following table from A. Macalister's Text-Book ofCERVICAL NERVES. 564 Anatomy gives tlie relation of the point of origin of each nerve to tlie bodies and tips of the spinous processes of the vertebrae :â€” Level of Body of No. of Nerve.

The cervical nerves increase in size from the first to the fifth, and then remain the same size to the eighth. The first (subocci^ntal) passes out of the spinal canal between the occipital bone and atlas; the second between the posterior ring of the atlas and the lamina of the axis ; and the last between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebra. Each nerve, at its escape from the intervertebral foramen, divides into an anterior and a j)osterior division. The anterior divisions of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus; the posterior divisions, the iwsterior cervical flexus. The anterior divisions of the four inferior cervical together with the first dorsal form the brachial plexus. ANTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES.â€”The anterior division of the first cervical or suboccipital nerve escapes from the .spinal canal through the gi'oove on the posterior arch of the atlas, which supports the vertebral artery, lying loeneath that vessel. It descends in front of the transverse process of the atlas, sends twigs to the occipito- atlantal joint, rectus lateralis and rectus anticus minor, and forms an anastomotic loop by communicating with an ascending branch of the second nerve. Branches froni this loop communicate witli the pneumogastric nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and superior cerviciil ganglion of the symjsathetic. The anterior cord of the second cervical nerve, at its exit from the intervertebral foramen between the atlas and axis, gi^^es twigs to the rectus anticus major, scalenus medius, and levator anguli scapulae, and divides into three bran dies : ascending branch, whichCERVICAL PLEXUS. 565 completes the arch of communication with the first nerve ; and two descending branches, which form loops with corresjooncling branches of the third nerve. The anterior cord of the third cervical nerve, double the size of the preceding, divides at its exit from the invertebral foramen into several branches, some of which are distributed to the rectus major, longus colli, and scalenus medius, wliile others communicate and form loops Avith the second and fourth nerves. The anterior cord of the fourth, cervical nerve, eqvial in size with the preceding, sends twigs to the rectus major, longus colli, and leva- tor anguli scaj)ulÂ£ie, communicates with the third, and sends a small brancli downwards to the fifth nerve. Its principal branches pass downwards and outwards across the j)osterior triangle of the neck, towards the clavicle and acromion. The anterior cords of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves will be described with the brachial plexus, of which they form a part. CERVICAL PLEXUS.â€”The cervical plexus is constituted by loops of communication between the anterior divisions of the first four cervical nerves. The plexus lests on the levator anguli scapulae, posterior and middle scalenus, and splenius colli muscle, and is covered by the sterno-mastoid and jjlatysma. The branches of the cervical plexus may be arranged into super- ficial and deep :â€” C Superficialis colli. Ascending, < Auricularis magnus, ( Occipitalis minor. iAcromial, Clavicular, Sternal. ( Communicating branches, j)Qgp _ _ ) Communicans cervicis, j Muscular, ' Phrenic. The superficialis colli is formed by communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and crosses obliquely behind the external jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, where It pierces the deep cervical fascia and divides into an ascending and a descending brancli. The ascending branch passes upwards to the submaxillary reo-ion and divides into four or five filaments, some of which pierce the platysma myoides, and supply tlie integument as high as the chin and lower part of the face; while others form a plexus with the mtramaxillary branches of the facial nerve beneath the platysma One or two filaments from this branch accompany the external jugular vein. The descending branch pierces the platysma, and is distributed to Superficial .566 CEIWIOAL NEIWES. the integument of tlie front of tlie neck as far downwai-ds as the sternum. The auricularis magnus, the largest of the three ascending brandies of tlie cervical plexus, also proceeds from the second and third cervical nerves ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends upon that muscle, lying parallel with the external jugular vein, to the parotid gland, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch is distributed to the integument over the paro- tid gland, and to the gland itself, communicating with the facial nerve. The posterior branch ascends behind the ear, where it divides into aurictdar branches, supplying tlie pinna ; and a mastoid branch which communicates with the posterior auricular branch of the facial and is distributed to the integument behind the ear. The auricular branches communicate with the auricular offsets of the facial nerve, pneumogastric nerve, and occipitalis minor. The occipitalis minor arises from the second cervical nerve; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid above the preceding, and ascends upon that muscle, jDarallel with its poste- rior border, to the lateral and jjosterior aspect of the cranium. It is distributed to the integument, to the occipital portion of the occipito-frontalis and attolleiis auriculam, and communicates with the occipitalis major, auricularis magnus, and posterior auricular branch of the facial. Superficial Descending Branches.â€”The acromial and clavicu- lar are two or three lai'ge nerves which proceed from the fourth cervical nerve, and pass downwards in the posterior triangle of the neck ; they pierce the deep fascia, and crossing the clavicle are dis- tributed to the integument of the front of the chest as low do^^â€¢n as the nipple line, from the sternum to the acromion ; hence their designation, clavicular and acromial. The most anterior of the branches is named sternal, from its destination, and the outermo.-^t branch passes over the clavicular attachment of the trapezius, to reach the shoulder. Deep Branches.-â€”The communicating branches are filament- which arise from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves, and pass inwards to communicate with the synijiathetic, pneumogasti'ic, and hypoglossal nerves. The first three cer\dcal nerves send branches to the first cervical ganglion ; the fourth sends a branch to the trunk of the sympathetic, or to the middle cervical ganglion. From the second cervical nerve a large branch is given off, which joins the spinal accessory nerve. The communicans cervicis (communicans noni) is a long and slender branch of communication between the cervical plexus and descendens cervicis ; it is formed by filaments from the second and third cervical nerves, descends at the outer side of the internal jugular vein, and forms a loop with the descendens cervicis over the sheath of the carotid vessels. The muscular branches of the cervical plexus are distributedPHRENIC NEEVE. 567 to the muscles of the front of the vertebral colnuin and side of the neck. From the loop, between the first and second nerve, branches are given to the anterior recti; from_ the second cervical nerve a branch proceeds to the sterno-mastoid; from the third and foicrth nerve branches are distributed to the trapezius, levator anguli scapulte, scalenus medius, and scalenus posticus. The branch to the trapezius communicates with the spinal accessory nerve. The phrenic nerve (internal respiratory of Bell) is formed by the union of filaments from the fourth and fifth _ cervical nerves, and is joined by a communication from the combined cord of the fifth and sixth and a filament from the sympathetic. It descends to the root of the neck, resting on the scalenus anticus muscle, crosses the first portion of the subclavian artery, and enters the chest between it and the subclavian vein, passing over the com- mencement of the internal mammary artery. Within the chest it passes downwards through the middle mediastinmn, lying between the pleura and pericardium, and in front of the root of the lung, to the diaphragm ; near the diaphragm it divides into branches which pierce that muscle, and are distributed on its under surface. Some of its filaments reach the abdomen through the openings for the ccsophagus and vena cava, and communicate with the phrenic and solar plexus, and on the right side with the hepatic plexus. The left phrenic nerve is longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side, and crosses the arch of the aorta. The right nerve is situated more deeply in the upper part of the chest than the left, and lies in contact with the right innominate vein and superior vena cava; at its termination it forms a plexus with branches derived from the solar plexus, and in this there is usually a small ganglion (phrenic ganglion). Each nerve is accompanied by the artei-ia comes nervi jDhrenici, a brancli of the internal mammary, and by two veins. POSTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES.â€”The posterior divisions of the cervical nerves issue fi'om between the tranverse processes, and divide into an internal-and external branch. The internal branch is directed inwards towards the middle of the spine, and, becoming cutaneous near the spinous processes of the vertebras, is then re- flected outwards to supply the integument. The external branch, smaller than the internal, is distributed to the muscles of the outer portion of the vertel)i'al groove. The posterior division of the first cervical nerve (suboccipital), larger than the anterior, escaj^es from.tlie spinal canal through the opening for the vertebral artery, lying posteriorly to that vessel, and emerges in the suboccipital tiiangle. It is distributed to the recti, obliqui, and complexus, and sends a branch downwards to com- municate with the second cervical nerve ; it has no external branch, _ The posterior cord of the second cervical nerve is three or four times larger than its anterior cord, and exceeds in size the other posterior cervical nerves. Its internal branch is the occipitalis major nerve.568 CERVICAL NERVES. The posterior cord of the third cervical nerve is .smaller tlian the second, but larger than the fourtli; its internal branch gives off a cutaneous branch to the back of the cranium. The ])osterior cords of the remaining cervical nerves go on pro- gressively deci-easing in size to the seventh. The internal branches of the second, third, fourth, and fifth nerves lie on the semispinalis colli muscle, and are closely connected with a fascia which separates that muscle from the complexus. The second and third, with a branch from the first, constitute the pos- terior cervical plexus ; and all the branches in their course to the surface pierce the complexus and trapezius, and some the sjjlenius. The internal branches of the sixth, seventh, and eighth nei ve> pass beneath the semispinalis colli, which they supply, as they also do the interspinals, multifidus spina?, and complexus ; finally they send twigs through the latter muscle to supply the skin over tlic spinous processes of the lower cervical vertebra?. The occipitalis major nerve, the internal branch of theposterioi cord of the second cervical nerve, ascends obliquely inwards be- tween the obliquus inferioi and complexus, pierces the complexus and trapezius after jiassing for a short distance between them, and ascends the posterior aspect of the head in company with the occi- pital artery. Soon after its escape from the trapezius, it receives a branch from the third cervical, and divides into numerous branches, which are distributed to the occipitalis muscle and to the integu- ment as far as the summit of the head. It communicates with the occipitalis minor nerve, and sends an auricular branch to the back of the ear. BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The brachial or axillary plexus of nerves is formed by communi- cations between the anterior divisions of the four lower cerAdcal nerves and first dorsal. These nerves are alike in size, and their mode of disposition in the formation of the jjlexus is as follows : the fifth and sixth unite to form a common trunk, the eighth and first dorsal unite in like manner, the seventh runs alone ; each of these three trunks then divides into an anterior and posterior brancli. The anterior branch of the trunk derived from the fifth and sixth receives the anterior branch of the seventh, and these together form the outer cord. The anterior branch of the trunk formed by the eighth and first dorsal constitutes the inner cord. The three pos- terior branches unite to form the posterior cord. The plexus is broad in the neck, narrows as it descends into the axilla, and again enlarges at its lower part, where it divides into its terminal branches. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus hj- means of a branch from the fourth to the fifth nerve, and receives branches from the two inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. The plexus is in relation in the neck with the scaleni muscles;BEACHIAL PLEXUS. 569 lower down it is placed between the clavicle and subclavius muscle above, and the first rib and first serration of the serratus magnus muscle below. In the axilla, it is situated at first to the outer side of and then behind the axillary artery, resting by its outer border against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Lower down it completely surrounds the artery. The branches of the brachial plexus are: from the outer cord, one of the anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median ; from the inner cord, the other anterior thoracic nerve, inner head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous of Wrisberg, and ulnar ; from the posterior cord, the subscapular nerves, circumflex, and musculo-sjDiral. Besides these, the brachial plexus, while in the neck, gives off several superior muscular branches: one to the subclavius muscle, Fig. 333.â€”Nerves forming the bra- chiiil plexus.

The posterior thoracic, or external respiratory of Bell, is formed by the junction of two offsets, one from the fifth, the other from the sixth cervical nerve ; it crosses behind the brachial plexus to reach the side of the chest, and descends on the serratus magnus to the lower part of that muscle, to which it is distributed. The superior muscular nerves are small branches to the longus colli and scaleni, and branches to the rhomboidei and subclavius. The rhomboid branch proceeds from the fifth cervical nerve, and passing backwards through the fibres of the scalenus medius, and beneath the levator anguli scapulae, is distributed to the under surface of the rhomboid muscles, in its course it sometimes gives a branch to the levator anguli scapulae. The subclavian branch, proceeding from the cord formed by the fifth and sixth nerve, descends in front of the subclavian artery, to the subclaviiTs muscle. This nerve usually communicates with the phrenic at its entrance into the chest. The suprascapular nerve arises from the ti-unk formed by the union of fifth and sixth cervical nerves and proceeds obliquely out- wards, along with the artery of the same name, to the suj)rascapular notch ; it passes through the notch, crosses the supra-spinous fossa beneath the supra-spinatus muscle, and running in front of the con- cave margin of the spine of the scapula enters the infra-spinous fossa, to be distributed to the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus muscles, and sends two or three filaments to the shoulder-joint. The subscapular nerves are three in number; one arises from the brachial plexus above the clavicle, the others from the posterior cord of the plexus within the axilla. The first or smallest supplies the upper part of the subscapularis muscle ; the second and largest (long subscapidar) follows the course of the subscapular artery, and is distriljuted to the latissimus dorsi; the third supplies the lower part of the subscapularis muscle and teres major. BRACHIAL NERVES.â€”The brachial branches of the plexus are arranged in the following order : musculo-cutaneous, and one head of the median to the outer side of the artery ; the other head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous, and ulnar, to its inner side ; the circumflex and musculo-spiral behind. Tlie MUSCULO-CUTANEOUS NERVE (external cutaneous, per- forans Gasserii) arises from the brachial plexus in common with the external head of the median; pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle, and passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus to the outer side of the bend of the elbow, where it perforates the deep fascia, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch. These branches pass behind the median cephalic vein ; the anterior, the larger of the two, runs along the radial border of the forearm and communicates Avith the radial nerve on the l)ack of the hand ; the posterior and smaller is distributed to the back of the forearm, communicating with the internal cutaneous, and distributes filaments to the syno- vial membranes of the wrist-joint. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies the coraco-brachialis, biceps,572 BEACH IAL PLEXUS. and bracliialis anticus in the vipper arm, and the integument of the outer side of the forearm as far as the wrist and hand. It also gives a branch to the elbow-joint, and another which accompanies the nutrient artery to the interior of the humerus. The INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE, one of the internal and smaller branches of the brachial plexus, arises from the plexus in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and pasM-,s down the inner side of the arm in company with the basilic vein, giving off several cutaneous filaments in its course. At about the middle of the upper arm it pierces the deep fascia by the side of the basilic vein and divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branch, the larger of the two, divides into seA'eral branches which pass in front of, and sometimes behind the median basilic vein at the bend of the elbow, and descend in the course of the palmaris longus muscle to the wrist, distributing filaments to the integument in their- course and communicating with the anterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous on the outer side, and its own internal branch on the inner side of the forearm. The posttr 'u r branch sends oft' several twigs to tlie integument over the inner con- dyle and olecranon, passes behind the inner condyle, and descenrls the forearm in the course of the ulnar vein as far as the wrist, sup- plying the integument of the imier side of the forearm, and com- municating with the external branch of the same nerve in front, and the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. The LESSER INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE, or nerve of Wrisberg, the smallest of the brachial nerves, arises with the preceding from the inner cord of the plexus, and issuing from 1 be- neath the axillary vein descends the inner side of the arm, to the middle of its posterior aspect, where it pierces the fascia and is dis- tributed to the integument of the lower third of the upper arm as far as the olecranon. While in the axilla, the nerve of Wrislx-rg communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and sometimes its place is taken by the latter. It also communicates with the postei im branch of the internal cutaneous nerve. The MEDIAN NERVE, named from its median position in the arm and forearm, arises by two heads which proceed from the outer and inner cord of the plexus and eml^race the axillary artery. The nerve lies at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, but crosses it in the middle, sometimes in front and sometimes behind, and getting to its inner side descends to the bend of the elbow. It next passes - between tlie two heads of the pronator radii teres and beneath the flexor sublimis digitorum, and runs down the middle of the forearm, lying between the latter muscle and the flexor profundus to the wrist. It then dips beneath the annular ligament and enters the palm of the hand. Just above the wrist it is superficial, lying be- tween the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor sublimis dio'itorum. In the foreaim the nerve is accompanied by a small branch of the anterior interosseous artery. The branches of the median nerve areâ€”573 MEDIAN NEEVE. Muscular, Anterior interosseous, The muscular branches are of the elbow; they are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar half of the flexor profundus. The branch to the pro- nator radii teres sends off reflected filaments to the elbow-joint. The anterior interosseous is a large branch ac- companying the anterior interos- seous artery, and the of the supplying dee^) layer muscles and bones of the fore- arm, being lost inferiorly in the pronator quad- ratus. From its lower end a small twig is given off to the front of the wrist-joint. The superficial palmar branch arises from the median at about the lower fourth of the forearm ; it crosses the an- nular ligament, and is distril)utecl to the integument thumb.

The muscular branch is disti-il)uted to the alxluctoi- pollicin, flexor ossis nietacarpi pollicis, and ivadial half of the flexor bj'evis pollicis. The digital branches are arranged as follows : two pass outwards to the tiuuub and supply its borders; tlie third runs along the radial side of the index finger, sending a twig to the first lumln i- calis in its course ; the fourth subdivides for the supply of tlie adjacent sides of the index and middle finger, and gives a twig to the second lumbricalis ; the fifth receives a filament of communica- tion from the ulnar nerve, and supijlies the collateral branches of the middle and ring fingers. Oj)posite the base of the first phalanx, each nerve gives off a dorsal branch which runs along the border of the dorsum of the finger. Near its extremity the nerve divides into a falmar and a dorsal branch ; the former supplying the sentient extremity of the finger, the latter the structures around and beneath the nail. Tlie digital nerves in their course along the fingers lie to the inner side of and superficially to the arteries ; and the nerve of one side of a finger has no communication with that of the opposite side. It will be obsei'ved that the median nerve supplies all the muscles of the front of the forearm except the flexor carpi ulnaris and half the flexor j^rofundus digitorum. In the liand it gives branches to those muscles of the thumb wliich lie to the radial side of tlift tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, and the two outer lumbricales ; the latter muscles are supplied by this nerve because they are con- nected with the tendons of that portion of the flexor profundus which derives its nerve supply from the median. The digital branches are distributed to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle, and half the ring fingers. The ULNAR NERVE is somewhat smaller than the median, behind which it lies, gradually diverging from it in its course. It arises from the inner cord of tlie brachial plexus in common with the internal head of the median and internal cutaneous nerve, and runs down the inner side of the arm, piercing tlie internal intermuscular septum from before backwards, to the groove between the internal condyle and olecranon, resting on the internal head of the tricei)_s, and accompanied by the inferior profiinda artery. At the elbow it is superficial, and supported by the inner condyle, against wliich it may be compressed, giving rise to the thrilling sensation along the inner side of the forearm and little finger, popularly ascribed to striking the " funny bone." It then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and descends along the inner side of the forearm, crosses the annular ligament with the ulnar artery, and divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. At the. commencement of the middle third of the forearm it comes into relation with the artery, and lies to the ulnar side of that vessel, as far as the hand.ULNAR NERVE. 575 The branches of tlie ulnar nerve areâ€” Articular, Dorsal branch, Muscular, Superficial. palmar. Cutaneous, Deep palmar. The articular branches are several filaments to the elbow-joint, given oft' from the nerve while lying in the groove between the inner condyle and olecranon. The muscular branches are distributed to the flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of the flexor profundus digitorum. The cutaneous branch proceeds from about the middle of the nerve, and descends upon the ulnar artery to the hand, giving twigs to the integument in its coiirse. One branch from its upper part, sometimes a separate offset from the nerve and sometimes absent, pierces the fascia, and communicates with the internal cutaneous nerve. The dorsal branch passes Imckwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, at the lower fourth of the forearm, and divides into branches which supply the integument and two fingers and a half on the posterior aspect of the hand, communicating with the radial nerve, with which it forms an arch. The superficial palmar branch, after giving some twigs to the palmaris brevis and inner border of the hand, divides into three filaments, two of which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, and one to the adjoining borders of the little and ring fingers, while the third, a communicating branch, joins the median nerve. The deep palmar branch passes between the abductor and flexor minimi digiti, to the deep palmar arch, supplying the muscles of the little finger, interossei, two ulnar lumbricales, adductor pollicis, and inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The ulnar nerve supplies in the forearm the flexor carpi ulnaris and half the flexor profundus digitorum ; in the hand it supplies all the muscles of the palm which lie to the ulnar side of the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb except the two radial lumbricales. Its cutaneous branches are distributed to one and a half flngers on the front and two and a half on the back of the hand. The MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE, the largest branch of the brachial plexus, arises from its posterior trunk in common with the circum- rtex, and, descending behind the axillary and brachial artery, winds around the humerus between the triceps and the bone, and in com- pany with the superior profunda artery, pierces the external inter- muscular septum from behind forwards to reach the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, and runs thence onwards to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two branches, radial and posterior interosseous. The branches of the musculo-spiral nerve areâ€” Muscular, Cutaneous, Radial, Posterior interosseous.576 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 17^ Tlie muscular branches are distrilnited to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. The cutaneous branches are three in number, internal and two external. The in- ternal branch arLses from the nerve in the axilla, and pierc- ing the deep fascia in the ujjper third of the arm on its pos- terior aspect, com- municates with tlie intercosto - humeral nerve, and is distri- buted to the integu- ment of the posterior aspect of the upper arm, as far as the olecranon. The external cuta- neous branches pas? through the sub- stance of the external head of the triceps, and pierce the deep fascia; one, wpiw. near the insertion of the deltoid, tlie other, lower, at about the middle of the upper arm. The upper branch follows the course of the cephalic vein, sup- plying the integu- ment of the outer and fore-part of the upper arm as far as the bend of the elbow. The loioer branch passes down the outer side of the forearm, reaches the posterior aspect at about its middle, and is continued on- wards to the wrist, where it comuiunicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous.

The radial nerve runs along the radial side of the forearm to the commencement of its lower third; it there passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and, at about two inches above the wrist-joint, pierces the deep fascia and divides into an external and internal branch. The external branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the outer border of the thumb, and communicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The internal branch crosses the direction of the extensor tendons of the thumb, and divides into several filaments for the supply of the ulnar border of the thumb, radial border of the index finger, and adjacent borders of the index and middle fingers. It communicates above the wrist with the pos- terior branch of the musculo-cu.taneous nerve, and on the back of the hand forms an arch by joining with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. On the backs of the fingers the digital branches com- municate with tliose of the median nerve. In the upper third of the forearm the radial nerve lies beneath the border of the supinator longus muscle; in the middle third it is in relation with the radial artery, lying to its outer side; and in the lower third it quits the artery, and passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to reach the back of the hand. The radial nerve is purely cutaneous in its distribution, giving no branches to muscles. The posterior interosseous nerve, somewhat larger than the radial, separates from the latter at the bend of the elbow, pierces the supinator brevis muscle and emerges from its lower border on the posterior aspect of the forearm, where it divides into branches which supply all the muscles of the posterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the anconeus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. In passing from the front to the back of the forearm it winds round the outer side of the radius, and does not pass between the two bones as the posterior interosseous artery does. One branch, longer than the rest, descends upon the interosseous membrane to the posterior part of the wrist, and forms a gangliform swelling (a common character of nerves which supply joints), from whicli numerous filaments are distributed to the wrist-joint and to the metacar]io-]:)halangeal articulations. The CIRCUMFLEX NERVE arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus in common with the musculo-spiral. It passes down- wards over the hovdev of the subscapularis muscle, winds around the neck of the humerus with the posterior circumflex artery, and splits into an upper and lower division ; the upper division is con- tinued onwards beneath the deltoid, and distributed to the anterior art of that muscle, some of its branches piercing the muscular bres and becoming cutaneous. Tlie lower division sends a branch (remarkable for a gangliform swelling) to the teres minor, several branches to the posterior part of the deltoid, and mounting upon the border of that muscle becomes cutaneous, supplying the integu- ment over its lowei' half hy means of several filaments. Besides its 2 o578 DORSAL NERVES. muscular and cutaneous branches, the trunk of the nerve gives off an articular branch, which enters the shoulder-joint at its posterior and under part. DORSAL NERVES. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number at each side, the fiisi appearing between the first and second dorsal vertebra, the last between the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar. They are smallei- than the lower cervical nerves, diminish gradually in size from tlie first to the tenth, and then increase to the twelfth. Each nerve, as soon as it has escaped from the intervertebral foramen, sej^arates into an anterior and posterior division ; the anterior divisions being the intercostal nerves, the posterior the dorsal branches of the dorsal nerves. M The dorsal branches pass directly Ijackwards between the trans-1 verse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the anterior â–  costo-transvei'se ligament, and each nerve divides into an mternalm and external branch. The intcryial branches diminish in size fromH the first to the last. The six upper branches pass inwards between I the semi-spinalis dorsi and multifidus spinte, and, piercing theB rhomboid, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi, become cutaneous close â–  to the spinous jorocesses, and are then reflected outwards to supplyH the integument. The six lower branches are lost in the muscles offl the spine. H The external branches increase in size from above downwards, andfl make their appearance in the line of separation between the longis^B simus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis. The six upper branches are dis^| tributed to those muscles and the levatores costarum. The si^H lower, after supplying the same muscles, pierce the serratus iDOsticui^B inferior and latissimus dorsi in a line with the angles of the rib^H and becoming cutaneous, are directed downwards and forwards ove^f the side of the trunk. INTERCOSTAL NERVES.â€”The anterior cords of the dorsa" nerves, twelve in number at each side, are the intercostal nerves. Each intercostal nerve passes outwards in the intercostal sjiace iu company with the intercostal vessels, below which it lies ; at the commencement of its course it rests on the external intercostal muscle ; farther outwards it is placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles ; beyond the middle of the rib it enters the sub- stance of the internal intercostal and reaches its inner surface, being in contact with the pleura ; finally, at the anterior extremity of the intercostal space, it crosses in front of tlie triangularis stern i and internal mammary vessels, and piercing the internal intei-costal muscle and pectoralis major, is distributed to the integument of the front of the chest and mammary gland, under the name of anterior cutaneous. The intercostal nerve, near its origin, sends one or i two filaments to the neighbouring dorsal ganglion of the synipa-1 thetic and midway between the vertebral column and sternmn, . while'situated between the intercostal muscles, gives off a lateral \579 ABDOMINAL INTERCOSTAL NERVES. cutaneous branch wlaiclx pierces the external intercostal muscle and divides into an anterior and posterior twig for the supply of the integument of the side of the thorax. Abdominal Intercostals.â€”This description applies in full only to the six upper intercostal nerves; the six lower, with the excep- tion of tlie last, cross the cartilages of the ribs where the thorax is deficient and take their course between the internal oblique and trans versalis muscles to the sheath of the rectus, and, after supply- ing tliat muscle, to the linea alba, by the side of which they reach the integument constituting the anterior cutaneous nerves of the "abdomen. The first and the last intercostal nerves are exceptions to this general scheme of distribution. The first ascends over the first rib to join the brachial plexus, and gives off only a small branch, to take the usual course of the other intercostal nerves. The last or twelfth nerve lies below the last rib, and after crossing the quaclratus lumborum takes its coxirse between the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscle like the other inferior intercostals. Near its origin it sends a branch, the dorsi-lumbar, downwards to join the first lumbar nerve. The branches of the intercostal nerves areâ€”muscular, lateral cutaneous, and anterior cutaneous. The muscular branches are small twigs distributed to the inter- costal and neighbouring muscles. The lateral cutaneous nerves, given off from the intercostals at about the middle of the lateral half of the thorax, pierce the ex- ternal intercostal muscle and pass between the fibres of the serratus magnus above and the obliquus externus below to reach the surface. The lateral cutaneous nerve then divides into an anterior and pos- terior branch. The anterior branches are directed forwards to sup- ply the integument of the antero-lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior branches turning around the inferior border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland. The posterior branches take their coui-se backwards to supply the integument of the postero- lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior turning around the posterior border of the axilla to reach the integument over the lower part of the scapula and latissimus dorsi; and that from the third intercostal being distributed to the integument of the axilla and neighbouring jiart of the arm. The first intercostal gives oft" no lateral cutaneous nerve ; the lateral cutaneous Ijranch of the second intercostal nerve will be presently described, under the name of intercosto-humeral nerve. The lateral cutaneous branch of the last intercostal nerve pierces the internal and external oblique muscle, crosses the crest of the ilium just behind the tensor vaginse femoris, and is distributed to the integument of the anterior part of the gluteal region as low down as the trochanter major. The anterior cutaneous nerves are divided according to their osition into those of the thorax and those of the abdomen.

The intercosto-humeral nerve is the posterior division of theLUMBAR NERVES. 581 lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve; after piercing the external intercostal muscle, it passes downwards into the axilla and commnnicates with a branch of the lesser internal cutaneous nerve of Wrisberg. It then perforates the deep fascia, and is dis- tributed to the integument of the inner and back part of the arm to about the middle, and to the integument covering the lower part of the scapula. On the back of the arm it communicates with the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. This nerve sometimes takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg. There are five pairs of lumbar nerves, of which the first makes its appearance between the first and second lumbar vertebra ; the last between the fifth lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The anterior divisions increase in size from above downwards. They communi- cate at their origin with the lumbar ganglia of the symj)athetic, and pass obliquely outwards behind the psoas magnus, or between its fasciculi, sending twigs to that muscle and to the quadratus lum- borum. In this situation each nerve divides into two branches, a superior branch which ascends to form a loop of commvmication with the nerve above ; and an inferior branch which descends to join in like manner the nerve below. The communications which are thus established constitute the lumbar plexus. The posterior divisions diminish in size from above downwards ; they pass backwards between the transverse processes of the corre- sponding vertebrse, and each nerve divides into an internal and ex- ternal branch. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, passes inwards to be distributed to the multifidus spin.ie and inter-spinales. The externcd branches communicate with each other by several looj)S, and, after supplying the deeper muscles, pierce the sacro-lumbalis to reach the integument, to which they are distributed. The exter- nal branches of the three upper lumbar nerves descend over the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and are distributed to the integument of the gluteal region. LUMBAR PLEXUS.â€”The lumbar plexus is formed by the com- munications and anastomoses which take place between the anterior divisions of the four upper lumbar nerves, and between the latter and the last dorsal. It is narrow above, increases in breadth in- feriorly, and is situated between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae and quadratus lumborum behind, and the psoas magnus muscle in front. The branches of the lumbar plexus are theâ€” The ILIO-HYPOGASTRIC NERVE proceeds from the first lumbar LUMBAR NERVES.

It then pierces the transversalis muscle, and between it and the internal oblique divides into its two terminal branches, iliac and hypogastric. The iliac branch, pierces the internal and external obliqiie, muscles close to their attachment, and a little behind tlie middle of the crest of the ilium ; it is distributed to the integument of th gluteal region as far down as the upper part of the hip. The hypogastric branch continues its course onwards, piercing Fig. 338. â€” Lumbar plexus. I. Right gaugliated cord of sympathetic. 2. Ab- dominal aorta. 3, 3. Last dorsal nerves. 4. Psoas parvus. 5.

It is distributed to the integument of the hyiiogastric region and mons pubis. The ILIO-INGUINAL' NERVE, smaller than the preceding, also arises from the first lumbar nerve. It passes obliquely downwards and outwards below the ilio-hypogastric nerve, and crosses the quad- ratus lumborum and iliacus muscles to the anterior part of the crest of the ilium ; it then ]3ierces the transversalis muscle, and between that muscle and the obliquus internus communicates with the iho- hypogastric nerve. It next pierces the obliquus internus, and entersGENITO-CKUEAL NEEVE. 583 the iuguinal canal, which it traverses, lying in front of the spermatic Corel, and escapes at the external abdominal ring to be distributed to the scrotum and to the integument of the upper part of the thigh, internally to the saphenous opening; and in the female to that of the pudendum. The GENITO-CRURAL NERVE proceeds from the second lumbar and by a few filaments from the loop between it and the first. It traverses the psoas magiflis from behind forwards, and runs down the anterior surface of that muscle, lying beneath its fascia, to near Poupart's ligament, where it divides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch crosses the external iliac artery to the in- ternal abdominal ring, and descends along the sj)ermatic canal, lying behind the cord, to the scrotum, where it distributes twigs to the spermatic cord and cremaster muscle. In the female it gives twigs to the round ligament and external labiimi. At the internal abdo- minal ring this nerve sends oft' a branch, which, after supplying the lower border of the internal oblique and transversalis, is lost in the integument of the groin. The crural branch, the most external of the two, descends along the outer border of the external iliac artery, and, crossing the origin of the deej) circumflex iliac artery, enters the sheath of the femoral vessels in front of the femoral artery. It j)ierces the sheath below Poupart's ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the anterior asj)ect of the thigh as far as its middle. This nerve com- mimicates with the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural nerve, and is often very small. The EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE proceeds from the second lumbar, and from the loop between it and the third. It pierces the posterior fibres of the psoas muscle and crossing the iliacus on the iliac fascia, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, passes into the thigh, beneath Poupart's ligament, where it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The posterior branch crosses the tensor vaginae femoris muscle to the outer and posterior aspect of the thigh, and supplies the skin as far as its middle. The anterior nerve, after passing for three or four inches down the thigh in a sheath formed by the fascia lata, becomes superficial, and divides into two branches, which are distributed to the in- tegument of the outer border of the thigh, and to the articulation of the knee. Its branches assist in the formation of the plexus patellae. The OBTURATOR NERVE is formed by a branch from the third, and another from the fourth lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the obturator externus and adductor muscles of the thigh, the hip and knee joint, the femoral and popliteal artery, and sometimes to the integument of the upper and inner part of the leg. From its origin it takes its course among the fibres of the psoas muscle, through the angle of bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, and along the inner584 LUMBAR NERVES. border of the brim of the pelvis, to the obturator foramen, where it joins the obturator artery. Having escaped from the pelvis, it divides into an anterior and pos- terior braiicli. The anterior branch passes downwards in front of the adductor brevis, supplies that muscle together with the pectineus, gracilis, and adductor longus, and at the lower border of the latter unites with the internal cutaneous and long saphenous nerve, to form a plexus. It then passes onwards to the femoral artery, to which it distributes filaments. In its course this nerve gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint; and a cuta- neous branch, which jjierces the fascia lata at the knee, communi- cates with the long saphenous nerve, and is distributed to the in- tegument of the inner side of the leg as far as its middle. The cuta- neous branch is often, wanting, its ])lace being supplied by the internal cutaneous nerve, and sometimes by the acces- sory obturator. the posterior branch pierces the obturator ex- ternus muscle, to which and to the adductor magnus it distributes branches ; it also gives off an articular branch which pierces the ad- ductor magnus muscle, and accompanies the popliteal artery to the knee-joint. ^ . â–  i â€¢ i, The accessory obturator nerve, small and inconstant, is a lugn Fig. 339.â€”Lumbar and sacral plex- uses, with the nerves of the lower extremity, i.

It jDasses down the inner border of the psoas muscle, crosses the os pubis, and dips beneath the pectineus, where it divides into branches. One of its branches is distributed to the pectineus, another supplies the hip-joint, while a third communi- cates with the anterior branch of the obturator nerve, and when of large size constitutes its cutaneous branch. As already stated, the existence of the accessory obturator nerve is uncertain. The ANTERIOR CRURAL is the largest of the divisions of the lumbar plexus ; it is formed by the union of branches from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, and is distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the thigh, leg, and foot, to all the muscles of the front of the thigh (excepting one), to the iliacus, j)ectineus, femoral artery, and knee-joint. Emerging from beneath the psoas, the nerve passes downwards in the groove between that muscle and the iliacus, and beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh, where it spreads out and divides into numerous branches. At Poupart's ligament it is separated from the femoral artery by the breadth of the psoas muscle, which at this point is scarcely more than half an inch in diameter, and by the iliac fascia, beneath which it lies. Branches.â€”Within the pelvis, the anterior crural nerve gives off three or four twigs to the iliacus muscle, and a branch to the femoral artery. The latter divides into filaments which entwine about the artery, and follow its course downwards in the thigh. Below Pou- part's ligament the crural nerve becomes flattened out, and divides into numerous branches, Mdiich may be arranged into two principal groups, superficial and deep. The separate branches of these groups are as follows :â€” Superficial. Deep. Middle cutaneous. Muscular, Internal cutaneous. Articular, Long or internal saphenous. The superficial branches are mainly cutaneous, but they supply motor filaments to two muscles, namely, pectineus and sartorius ; the deep branches are all motor, with the exception of the long saphenous, which is purely sensory. The middle cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia lata at about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into two branches, which pass down the inner and front part of the thigh, and are distributed to the integument as low as the knee-joint. At its upper part the external branch comnmnicates with the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve ; and below, the internal branch communicates with the internal cutaneous. One or both of these branches sometimes pierce the sartorius muscle. The internal cutaneous nerve passes inwards in front of theLUMBAK NERVES. 586 noiis nerve. 23. 17. Branches to sheath of the femoral arteiy, and divides into an anterior and an inner branch. Previously to its division it gives off three cutaneoii> filaments, which pierce the fascia near the internal saphena vein, and following tha course of that ves- sel, are distributed to the integument of the inner side of the thigh as low down as tlie knee. The upper- most of these fila- ments passes tlirough the sa- phenous opening, the middle bi- comes subcuta- neous at about the middle of the thigh, and the lowest pierces the fascia at its lower third. The anterior branch 2)asses down the imier side of the thigh, and pierces the fascia at its lower third, near the internal saphena vein. It then divides into two twigs, one of which continues onwards to the inner side of the knee; while the other curves outwards to its outer side, com- municating in its course with n branch of the long saphenous nerve. The inner branch descends along the inner and posterior Ijorder of the sartorius muscle to the knee, Avhere it pierces the fascia lata, and gives off several cutaneous twigs. It then sends a small braneli of communication to the long saphenous nerve, and passes dowu- FiG. 340.â€”Nerves of the thigh, i. Gangliated cord of sympathetic. 2. Third lum- bar nerve 3.

While beneath the fascia lata it aids in the formation of a jDlexus by uniting with branches of the long saphenous nerve and descend- ing branch of the obturator. When the latter is large the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve is small, and may terminate in the plexus, or merely give off a few cutaneous filaments. The long or internal saphenous nerve inclines inwards to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and passes downwards in front of the sheath and beneath the aponeurotic expansion which covers the sheath, to the opening in the adductor magnus. It then quits the femoral vessels, and continuing to descend, passes between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis, and reaches the internal saphena vein. By the side of the latter it passes down the inner side of the leg, in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the foot as far as the great toe, being distributed to the integu- ment in its course. The branches of the long saphenous nerve in the thigh areâ€”one or two to join the plexus formed by the obturator and internal cutaneous nerves ; and a large bi'anch, the cidaneits patellce, whicli pierces the sartorius and fascia lata at the inner side of the knee, and divides into many twigs, which are distributed to the integu- ment of the front of the knee. Above the patella this branch com- municates with the anterior brancli of the internal cutaneous nerve, and with the terminal twigs of the middle, and external cutaneous. Below the patella it communicates with other branches of the long saphenous ; the whole of these communications constitiiting a kind of plexus (]3lexus patellae). The branches of the long saplienous nerve below the knee are distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the leg. By one of these branches it communicates witla the cutaneous branch of the oljturator nerve. The muscular branches of the anterior crural nerve supply all the muscles of the front of the thigh (with the exception of the tensor vaginaD femoris, which obtains its nerve from the superior â– gluteal) and the pectineus. The branch to the fedineus passes be- hind the sheath of the femoral vessels ; the branches to the sartorius, three or four in number, arise with the cutaneous nerves, and some- times are supplied by the latter. Tlie branch to the rectus enters the deep surface of that muscle. The branch to the vastus externus follows the course of the descending branch of the external circum- flex artery ; the branch to the crureus passes directly to that muscle ; and the branch to the vastus internus, remarkable for its lengtli, descends by tlie side of the sheath of the femoral vessels. The articular branches are distributed to the knee-joint; one enters the joint at its outer side, being derived from the nerve of the vastus externus; the other, proceeding from the nerve of the vastus internus, descends with the anastomotica magna to a level with the joint, and then pierces the capsular ligament. The LUMBO-SACRAL NERVE.â€”The anterior division of the fifthS88 SACKAL NERVES. lumbar nerve, conjoined with a branch from the fourth, constitutes the lumbo-sacral nerve, which descends over the base of the sacrujn into the pelvis, and assists in forming the sacral plexus. Immedi- ately before it joins the first sacral, it gives off the superior gluteal nerve, but this nerve is, notwithstanding, usually described as a branch of the sacral plexus. The connection of the nerves of the i)lexus with the anterioi- divisions of the lumbar nerves, may be most simply expressed in a tabular form, as follows :â€” Ilio-hypogastric Ilio-inguinal Genito-crural . External cutaneous . Anterior crural Obturator Lumbo-sacral . SACRAL NERVES. There are five pairs of saciul nerves; the first four escape from the vertebral canal through the sacral foramina, the last between the sacrum and coccyx. The posterior sacral nerves are small, and diminish in size from above downwards; they communicate with each other by means of anastomosing Ioojds immediately after their escape from the j)Osterior sacral foramina, and divide like the other spinal nerves into external and internal branches. The external branches pierce the gluteus maximus, to which they give filaments, and are distributed to the integument of the posterior part of the gluteal region. The internal branches suj^ply the multitidus sjjincB muscle and the integument over the sacrum and coccyx. The anterior sacral nerves diminish in size from above down- wards ; tlie first is large, and unites with the lumbo-sacral nerve; the second, of equal size, unites with the first; and the third, scarcely one-fourth so large as the second, joins with the two preceding nerves in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth sacral nerve divides into two branches, one of which assists in forming the sacral plexus ; the other separates into three branches : a communicating branch, to unite with the fifth sacral nerve ; a visceral branch, to join with the hypogastric plexus and supply the bladder and prostate gland, and in the female the vagina ; and a muscular branch, which sends filaments to the levator ani and coccygeus, and a hmnorrhoidal branch to the sphincter ani and integument behind the anus. The fifth sacral nerve, issuing from between the sacrum and coccyx, pierces the coccygeus muscle, and receives the communi- cating branch from the fourth ; it then communicates with the coccygeal nerve, and piercing the coccygeus a second time, is distri- buted to the integument over the dorsal surface of the coccyx.

The coccygeal nerve pierces tlie coccygeus muscle, and imites with the fifth sacral nerve, in which it is lost The connection between the fourth and fifth sacral nerves and the coccygeal is sometimes described as the coccygeal flexus. 27 29 31 33.

SACRAL _ PLEXUS.â€”The sacral plexus is formed by the union of the lumbo-sacral and the anterior divisions of the three upper sacralSACEAL NERVES. 590 nerves and one-lialf the fourth. The plexus is triangular in form, its base corresponding with the whole length of the sacrum, and its apex with the lower part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen. It is in relation behind with the pyriformis muscle, and in front with the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the internal iliac vessels and the viscera of the pelvis. The branches of the sacral plexus areâ€” Visceral, Pudic, Muscular, Lesser ischiatic, Superior gluteal. Greater ischiatic. Inferior gluteal. The visceral nerves are three or four large branches derived from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves : they ascend by the side of the rectum and bladder; in the female by the side of the rectum, vagina, uterus, and bladder; and interlace with branches of the hypogastric plexus, sending in their course numerous filaments to the pelvic viscera. The muscular branches are one or two twigs to the levator ani; an obturator branch, which curves around the sj^ine of the ischium along with the pudic vessels and nerve, to reach the internal surface of the obturator internus muscle; two twigs to the pyriforviis; a branch to the gemellus su2)erior ; and a branch of moderate size, which descends between the gemelli muscles and the ischium, and is dis- tributed to the gemellus inferior, qnadratus femoris, and cajjsule of the hijJ-joint. The SUPERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE arises from the lumbo-sacral near its junction with the first sacral nerve; it passes out of the pelvis with the gkiteal artery, through the great sacro-ischiatic fora- men above the pyriformis muscle, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The superior branch follows the direction of the middle curved line of tlie ilium, accompanying the deep superior branch of the gluteal artery, and sends filaments to the gluteiis medius and minimus. The inferior branch passes obliquely doAvnwaixls and forwards between the gluteus medius and minimus, distributing numerous filaments to both, and terminates in the tensor vaginte femoris muscle. The superior gluteal nerve should, properly, be described with the himbar plexus, as its fibres are entirely derived therefrom, the sacral plexus contributing nothing to its formation; its descrij^tion with the latter is, however, so thoroughly sanctioned by usage that. we hesitate to make a change. The INFERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE is often described as a branch of the lesser ischiatic, with which it is intimately comiected. It arises from the lumbo-sacral cord and first and second sacral nerves, escapes from the pelvis through the greater sacro-sciatic foramen,PUDIC NERVE. 591 below the pyriformis muscle, and enters the deep aspect of the gluteus maximus, to which it is distributed. The PUDIC NERVE arises from the lowest part of the sacral plexus and passes out of the pehds through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle. It crosses the spine of_ the ischium, and re-entering the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, accompanies the internal pudic artery through Alcock's canal, lying iuferiorly to the artery and enclosed in the same sheath. Near its origin it gives off the inferior hmmorrhoidal nerve, and in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa divides into a superior and inferior branch. The inferior hsemorrhoidal nerve, often a branch of the sacral plexus, crosses the ischio-rectal fossa with the vessels of the same name, and descends to the termination of the rectum to be distributed to the sphincter ani and integument. The dorsalis penis nerve, the superior division of the internal pudic, ascends along the posterior surface of the ramus of the ischium, pierces the triangular ligament, and accompanies the arteria dorsalis penis to the glans, to which it is distributed. At the root of the penis the nerve gives off a cutaneous branch which runs along the side of the organ, gives filaments to the corpus cavernosum, and with its fellow of the opposite side sujoplies the integument of the iipper two-thirds of the penis. The perineal nerve or inferior terminal branch, larger than the preceding, pursues the course of the superficial perineal artery in the perineum and divides into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal), two in number, fosterior and anterior, enter the ischio-rectal fossa and pass forward with the superficial perineal artery to be distributed to the integu- ment of the perineum, scrotum, and under part of the joenis. The posterior superficial perineal nerve sends a few filaments to the in- tegument of the anus and sphincter ani; while the anterior gives oft' one or two twigs to the levator ani. Tlie muscular branches proceed from a single trunk, which passes inwards behind tlie transversus perinei muscle; they are distributed to the transversus perinei, accelerator urinse, and erector ])enis. The perineal nerve also sends two or three filaments to the corpus spongiosum. In the female the pudic nerve is distributed to the parts analo- gous to those of the male. The superior branch supplies the clitoris ; the inferior the vulva and perineum. Tlie LESSER ISCHIATIC NERVE arises from the second and third sacral nerves ; it passes out of the pelvis tlirough the great sacro- ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, and continues its course downwards through the thigh to the lower part of the popli- teal region, where it pierces the fascia and becomes subcutaneous. It then accompanies the external saphena vein to the lower part of the leg, and communicates with the external saphenous nerve. The branches of the lesser iscliiatic nerve are all cutaneous ; they dSACRAL NERVES. 592 are divisible into external, internal, and middle. Tlie external cutaneous branches are sevei'al lilanieuts wliicli tui-n around the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the integu- ment over the lii]) and outer side of the thigh. The internal cutaneous branches are dis- trilnited to the in- tegument of the upper and inner part of the thigli. One of these, larger than the rest, in- ferior pudendal, curves around the tuberosity of the ischium, pierces the fascia lata near the ramus of that l^one, and, after communicating with one of the superficial peri- neal nerves, is dis- tributed to the in- tegument of the scrotum and peni?;. The middle cu- taneous branches, two or three in number, are de- rived from the lesser ischiatic in its course down the thigh, and are distributed to the integument. The GREAT ISCHIATIC NERVE is the largest nervous cord in the body ; it is formed by the sacral plexus, or rather is a pro- longation of the plexus, and at its exit from the great sacro-ischiatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle measures tliree-tiuarters ot an inch in breadth. It descends through the middle of the space be- I Fig. 342.â€”Dissec- tion of the but- tock and back of tlietliigh. I. Glu- teus maximus. 2. Gluteus medi- us. 3. Gluteal artery and nerve. 4.

This division sometimes takes place at the plexus, and the two nerves descend side by side ; occasionally they are separated at their com- mencement by a part or by the whole of the pyriformis muscle. The nerve in its course down the thigh rests on the gemellus superior, tendon of the obturator internus, gemellus inferior, quad- ratus femoris, and adductor magnus, and is covered by the gluteus maximus and biceps. The branches of the great ischiatic nerve, previously to its division, are, muscular and articular. The muscular branches are given off from the upper part of the nerve and suj)ply both heads of the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and adductor magnus. The articular branch descends to the upper -part of the external condyle of the femur, and divides into filaments, which are dis- tributed to the fibrous capsule and synovial membrane of the knee- joint. The INTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE passes through the middle of the popliteal space, from the division of the great ischiatic nerve to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, accompanies the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the j)osterior tibial nerve. It is superficial in the whole of its course, and lies externally to the vein and artery. The branches of the internal popliteal nerve are â€” muscular or sural, articular, and a cutaneous branch, the external sa- phenous. The muscular branches, of considerable size, and four or five in number, are distributed to the two heads of the gastrocnemius, to the soleus, plantaris, and popliteus. The articular branches, two or three in number, supply the knee-joint, two of the twigs accompanying the internal articular arteries. The external or short saphenous nerve (communicans pop- litei, vel tibialis) proceeds from the middle of the internal popliteal, and descends in the groove between the two bellies of the gastroc- nemius muscle to the middle of the leg ; it then pierces the fascia, and, after receiving the communicans peronei, comes into relation with the external saphena vein, and follows the course of that vein to the outer ankle, to which, and to the integument of the heel and outer side of the foot (cutanens dorsi ]iedis externus), it distributes l)ranches. The POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE is continued along the pos- terior aspect of tlie leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the posterior part of the inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar nerve. In the upper part of its course it lies to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery ; it then becomes placed superficially to that vessel, and at the ankle is situ- 2 P594 PLANTAR NEEVES. ated to its outer side ; in the lower third of the leg it lies parallel with the inner border of the tendo-Achillis. The branches of the posterior tibial nerve are â€” three or four muscular twigs to the deep muscles of the pos- terior aspect of the leg, the Ijranch to the flexor longus hallucis accom- panies the nutrient artery of the fibula ; one or two filaments which entwine around the artery and then terminate in the integument; and a plantar cutaneous branch which pierces the internal anmilar ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the heel and inner border of the sole of the foot. The INTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE, larger than the external, crosses the posterior tibial vessels to enter the sole of the foot, and becomes j^laced be- tween the abductor hallucis and Hexor brevis digitorum ; it then enters the sheath of the latter muscle, and divides opposite the base of the metatarsal bones into thi'ee digital branches ; one to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toe ; the second, the adjacent sides of the second and third toe ; the third, the corresponding sides of the third and fourth toe. In its course the internal j^lantar nerve gives off cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner side and sole of the foot; muscular bi'anches to the muscles forming the inner and middle group of the sole ; a digitu branch to the inner border of the grea toe; and articular branches to th articulations of the tarsal and meta tarsal bones. The EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE, the smaller of the two, follows tli course of the external plantar arter to tlie outer border of the musculu Fig. 343.â€”Superficial nerves of the back of the leg. i.

It then aives branches to the integument of the outer border and sole Sf the foot, and sends forward two digital branches to supply the little toe and half the next. Comparison of the Nerves of the Sole of the Foot with those of the Palm of the Ha7id.â€” Tl\e cutaneous distribution of the internal plantar nerve cor- responds to that of /^^r^SJY^ the median nerve, and that of the ex- ternal plantar to the ulnar. The flexor brevis digitorum is supplied by the internal plantar and probably cor- responds to the flexor sublimis in the hand, supplied by the correspond- ing nerve, the me- dian ; the abductor hallucis and two inner lumbricales of the foot are also supplied by the same nerve, and agree in all respects with those occupy- ing the same posi- tion in the hand. The flexor acces- sorius, adductor hallucis, two outei' lumbricales, dorsal and palmar inter- ossei, transversus pedis, and muscles of the little toe are supplied by the external plantar nerve, a distribution corre- sponding very closely to that of the ulnar nerve in the hand. The flexor brevis hallucis differs from the flexor brevis pollicis in obtain- ing nerve supply for both heads from the same nerve, namely, the internal plantar. The EXTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE {peroneal nerve), one-half smaller than the internal, passes downwards by the side of the tendon of the biceps, and crosses the outer head of the gastrocnemius Fig. 344.â€”Second stage of dissec- tion of sole of foot.

The branches of the external popliteal nerve areâ€”communicans peronei, cutaneous, and articular. The communicans peronei, proceeding from the external pop- liteal near the head of the fibula, crosses the external origin of the gastrocnemius muscle, and, piercing the deep fascia, descends to the middle of the leg, where it joins the external saphenous nerve. It gives off one or two cutaneous filaments in its course. The cutaneous branch passes down the back part and outer side of the leg, supplying the integument. The articular branches follow the external articular arteries to the knee-joint. The ANTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE commences at the bifurcation of the external popliteal on the neck of the fibula, and passes beneath the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum, to reach the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, just as that vessel has emerged through the opening in the interosseous membrane. It descends the leg with the artery, lying at first to its outer side, then in front of it, and near the ankle becoming again placed to its outer side. Beach- ing the ankle it passes beneath the annular ligament, accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery, supplies the adjacent sides of the great and second toe, and communicates with the internal division of the mus- culo-cutaneous nerve. The branches given ofi' by the anterior tibial nerve areâ€”muscular to the muscles in its course ; and at the ankle a tarsal branch which may be considered as one of the terminal divisions of the nerve. This branch passes outwards upon the dorsum of the foot, becomes ganglionic like the posterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, and supplies the extensor brevis digitorum muscle and the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. The MUSCULO-CUTANEOUS NERVE passes downwards along the fibula, in the substance of the peroneus longus ; it then gets between the peroneus longus and brevis, next between the peronei and ex- tensor longus digitorum, and at the lower third of the leg piei ees the deep fascia, and divides into the internal and external cutaneous nerves of the foot. In its course it gives oft' several branches to the peronei muscles and cutaneous branches to the skin of the lower part of the leg. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the inner side of the foot and great toe, and the adjoining sides of the second and third toes communicating with the anterior tibial and internal saphenous. The external, or larger branch, supplies the adjacent sides of the third and fourth, and fourth and fifth toes, and communicates with the external saphenous.597 SYMPATHETIC NEKVES. SYMPATHETIC NEEVES. The sympathetic consists of a vertebral and prevertebral portion. Tlie vertebral portion is composed of a series of ganglia united by a longitudinal cord ; it descends along each side of the vertebral column from the head to the coccyx, communicates with the cranial and spinal nerves, and distributes branches to the internal organs and viscera. The prevertebral portion is that part of the sympa- thetic which appertains to the viscera, comprising the numerous ganglia and plexuses of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The sympathetic nerve communicates with the cerebro-sjiinal nerves immediately at their exit from the cranium and vertebral canal. With the fourth and sixth nerve, however, it unites in the cavernous sinus; with the olfactory in the nose ; and with the auditory in the meatus auditorius internus. The branches of distriliution accompany the arteries which suj)ply the different organs, and form communications around them which are called plexuses, and take the name of the artery with which they are associated ; thus we have the mesenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, and splenic plexus. The chief ganglia in the head are four in number ; namely, the ophthalmic or lenticular, the spheno-palatine or Meckel's, the otic or Arnold's, and the submaxillary ; three in the neck, superior, middle, and inferior cervical; twelve in the dorsal region ; four in the lumbar region ; and four or five in the sacral region. Each ganglion may be considered as a distinct centre, recei^dng and giving branches in four different directions, viz., superior or ascending, to communicate with the ganglion above ; inferior or descending, to communicate with the ganglion below ; external, to communicate with the spinal nerves ; and internal, to communicate with the sympathetic filaments of the opposite side, and be distributed to the viscera. As regards the spinal nerves it receives as well as gives, the white fibres of the sympathetic being derived from the cerebro- spinal nerves. CRANIAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. Cranial Ganglia. Ophthalmic, or lenticular ganglion, Spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion, Otic, or Arnold's ganglion, Submaxillary ganglion. The OPHTHALMIC GANGLION {ciliary; lenticular) is a small quadrangular and flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve and external rectus muscle ; it is in close * relation with the optic nerve and generally with the ophthalmic598 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. artery ; and is surrounded by adipose tissue, which renders its dis- section somewhat difficult. It is of a reddish-grey colour, like other sympathetic ganglia. Its branches of distribution are the short ciliary nerves, whicli arise from its anterior angles in two groups ; the upper group con- sisting of about four filaments ; the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into filaments which pierce the sclerotic around the optic nerve to supply Fio. 345.â€”Cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, i.

Its branches of communication are three : one, the long root, proceeds from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and joins its superior angle ; a short and thick branch, the short root, from the inferior division of the third nerve to its inferior angle ; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, from the cavernous j^lexus, which accompanies the long root to the ganglion. Occasionally the ophthalmic ganglion receives also a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion ; and sometimes from the abduceiis nerve.599 SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. The SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION (Meckel's), the largest of the cranial ganglia of the sympathetic, is situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa, a little below the superior maxillary nerve. It is of small size, of a reddish-grey colour, and triangular in shape; and is placed on the posterior part of the spheno-palatine nerves which it only partially involves. Its branches are divisible into four groups : ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. The ascending branches are three or four small filaments which are distributed to the periosteum of the orbit. One of these branches sometimes joins the ophthalmic ganglion, one the sixth nerve, and two the optic nerve. The descending branches are the three palatine nervesâ€”anterior, middle, and jjosterior. The anterior or large palatine nerve descends from the ganglion through the descending palatine canal, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen. It then passes forward in a groove in the hard j)alate, to the mucous membrane of which it is distril^uted, and reaches the incisive foramen, where it communicates with the naso-palatine nerve. While in the descending palatine canal, this nerve gives off several branches {inferior nasal), which enter the nose through open- ings in the palate bone, and are distributed to the middle and inferior meatus, inferior spongy bone, and antrum. The middle or external palatine nerve descends externally to the j>receding to the posterior palatine foramen, and distributes branches to the tonsil, soft ]Dalate, and uvula. The posterior or small palatine nerve quits the other nerves to enter a distinct canal, from which it emerges by a separate open- ing behind the posterior palatine foramen. It is distributed to the hard j^alate and gums near the point of its emergence, and also to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. The middle and posterior pala- tine nerves join with the branches of the glosso-pharyngeal in the formation of a plexus around the tonsil. The internal branches are the superior nasal and naso-palatine. The superior nasal nerves, four or five in number, enter the nasal fossa tlirough the spheno-palatine foramen, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the superior meatus, and superior and middle spongy bone. They are formed almost entirely by filaments derived from the superior maxillary nerve, which do not pass through Meckel's ganglion. The naso-palatine nerve (Scarpa) enters the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and crosses the roof of the nares to reach the septum, to which it gives filaments. It then curves downwards and forwards along the vomer, to the naso-palatine canal, and passes through that canal to the palate, to which and to the papilla behind the incisor teeth it is distributed. The two nerves are contained in canals situated at the junction of the two superior maxillary bones, termed the canals of Scarpa ; the right nerve is placed behind, the left in front. This nerve was described by Cloquet as uniting with its fellow in the naso-palatine canal and6oo SYMPATHETIC NERVES. constituting the naso-palatine ganglion. The existence of this gan- glion is disputed. The naso-palatine nerves are directly continuous with the spheno-palatine, derived from the superior maxillary, and are unconnected with the nerve cells of the ganglion. The posterior branches are the Vidian or pterygoid nerve, and the pterygo-palatine. The Vidian nerve, connected with the back part of the ganglion, passes directly backwards through the pterygoid or Vidian canal to the foi'amen lacerum basis cranii, where it divides into two branches, carotid and petrosal. The carotid branch crosses the foramen lacerum, surrounded by the cartilaginous substance Avhich closes that opening, and enters the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. The petrosal branch enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum basis cranii, piercing the cartilaginous substance, and passes backwards beneath the Gasserian ganglion and dura mater, embedded in a groove on the anterior surface of the petrous bone to the hiatus Fallopii. In the hiatus Fallopii it receives a branch from Jacob- son's nerve, and terminates in the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. The Vidian nerve contains both the motor and sympathetic roots of Meckel's ganglion, and most observers agree in regarding the motor power as derived from the facial nerve ; others, however, con- sider it to come from the spinal accessory or the glosso-pharyngeal. The pterygo-palatine nerve is a small branch which passes back- wards through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pterygo-palatine artery, to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the Eustachian tube and neighbouring part of the pharynx. Roots.â€”The spheno-palatine ganglion gets its motor root from the facial, spinal accessory, or glosso-pharyngeal, through the Vidian nerve, its sensory roots are the spheno-palatine branches of the supe- rior maxillary, and its sympathetic root is derived from the carotid plexus through the Vidian nerve. The OTIC GANGLION (Ai'uold's) is a small oval-shaped and flattened ganglion, lying against the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, close to the foramen ovale ; it is in relation, ex- ternally, with the trunk of that nerve, just at the point of union of the motor root; internally it rests against the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and tensor palati muscle; and posteriorly is in contact with the arteria meningea media. It is closely adherent to the internal pterygoid nerve, and appears like a swelling on that nerve. The branches of the otic ganglion are six in number ; two of dis- tribution and four of comnnuiication. The branches of distribution areâ€”a small filament to the tensor tympani muscle, and one or two to the tensor palati. The branches of communication areâ€”one or two filaments from the inferior maxillary nei've ; one or two filaments to the auriculo- temporal nerve, distributed with it to the parotid gland ; fila- ments from the nervi molles of the arteria meningea media, and the601 SUBMAXILLAEY GANGLION. lesser petrosal nerve. The latter nerve arises from the tympanic plexus in the middle ear, communicates with the gangliform en- I largement on the facial nerve, traverses the petrous bone to emerge i on its anterior surface through a minute opening external to the hiatus Fallopii; it crosses the middle fossa of the skull, and passes through the foramen ovale (or a special foramen) to join the otic ganglion. It conveys nerve filaments from the facial nerve a-nd glosso-j)haryngeal nerve, those from the former constituting the motor root, and those from the latter the sensory root of the gan- ; glion; the sympathetic root coming from the nervi molles on the I middle meningeal artery.

Its branches of distribution, six or eight in number, divide into many filaments, which supply the side of the tongue the sub- maxiUary gland, sublingual gland, and Wharton's duct. Its branches of communication are two or three from and to the lingual nerve ; one from the chorda tympani ; two or three which form a plexus with branches of the hyjDoglossal nerve : and one or two filaments which pass to the facial artery, and commu- nicate with the nervi molles from the cervical portion of the sympathetic.

These branches together with those derived from the carotid branch of the Vidian,' constitute the carotid plexus, situated for the most part on the outer side of the artery. Tlie continuation of tlie carotid plexus onwards with the artery by the side of the sella turcica, is the cavernous plexus. The carotid plexus is the centre of conmiunication between all the cranial ganglia and the .sympathetic in the neck; it also com- mimicates with most of the cerebral nerves, and distributes filaments with each of the branches of the internal carotid, to accompany those branches to their ultimate ramifications. The branches which accoin- l^any the anterior cerebral artery at each side, unite upon the ante- rior communicating artery, and according to Eibes form a small ganglion, the ganglion of Eibes. The existence of this ganglion is disputed. The ophthalmic ganglion communicates with the plexus by means of the long branch which reaches it from the cavernous plexus, often in connection with the nasal nerve, but sometimes with the third. The sphe7io-palatine communicates with the plexus by means of the carotid branch of the Vidian. The oiic ganglion is brought into connection with the plexus by means of the communication between the lesser petrosal nerve and tympanic plexus. The carotid plexus communicates with the third nerve in th cavernous sinus, and through the ophthalmic ganglion ; frequently with the fourth in the formation of the nerve of the tentorium; with the Gasserian ganglion ; with the ophthalmic division of the fifth in the cavernous sinus, and by means of the ophthalmic gan- glion ; with the superior maxillary, through the spheno-palatine ganglion ; and with the inferior maxillary, through the otic ganglion. It sends two branches directly to the sixth nerve, which unite wit' it as it crosses the cavernous sinus ; it communicates with the faci and auditory nerves, through the medium of the petrosal branch o the Vidian ; and with the glosso-pharyngeal by means of two fila ments to the tympanic nerve. CERVICAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The superior cervical ganglion is long and fusiform, of reddish-grey colour, smooth, and of considerable thickness, exten ing from within an inch of the carotid foramen in the petrous bo_ to opposite the lower border of the third cervical vertebra. It is i relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery an internal jugular vein ; and, behind, with the rectus anticus maja muscle. Its branches are divisible into superior, inferior, external, a internal; to which may be added, as proper jto tliis ganglio anterior. The superior (carotid nerve) is a single branch which ascends b603 CEEVICAL GANGLIA. i the side of the internal carotid, and divides into two branches ; one lying to the outer, the other to the inner side of that vessel. The two branches enter the carotid canal, and, by their communications with each other and with the carotid branch of the Vidian, consti- tute the carotid plexus. The inferior or descending branch, sometimes two, is the cord of communication with the middle cervical ganglion. The external branches are numerous, and may be divided into two sets : those which communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and hypoglossal nerve, and those which communi- cate with the first four cervical nerves. The internal branches are three in number : pharyngeal, to assist in forming the pharyngeal plexus ; laryngeal, to join the superior laryngeal nerve, and its branches; and superior cardiac nerve, or nervus superticialis cordis. The anterior branches accompany the external carotid artery with its branches, around which they form plexuses, and here and there small ganglia; they are named, from the softness of their texture, nervi moUes, and from their reddish hue, nervi subrufi. The branches accompanying the facial artery are conducted by that vessel to the submaxillary ganglion, and those which accompany the internal maxillary artery reach the otic ganglion through the medium of the middle meningeal artery. Small ganglia are found on these plexuses, and are named from the arteries on which they are situated. Tlie largest of these is placed between the external and internal carotid arteries in the angle of bifurcation of the common carotid ; it is named the inter- carotid ganglion or gland, and has been described by Luschka as not truly ganglionic, but similar in structure to the coccygeal gland. The middle cervical ganglion (thyroid ganglion) is small, and sometimes wanting. It is situated opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, and rests against the inferior thyroid artery. Its superior branch, or branches, ascend to communicate with the superior cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend to join the inferior cervical gan- glion ; one of these frequently passes in front of the subclavian artery, the other behind it. Its external branches communicate with the fifth and sixth I cervical nerves. Its internal branches are filaments which accompany the in- j ferior thyroid artery, inferior thyroid plexus; and the middle I cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus magnus. The inferior cervical ganglion (vertebral ganglion) is much , larger than the preceding, and constant in its existence. It is of a semilunar form, and situated on the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, immediately behind the vertebral ' artery ; hence its designation, 'â– 'â– vertebral ganglion J' Its superior branches communicate with the middle cervical ganglion.6o4 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. The inferior branches pass some before and some Ijehind the subclavian artery, to join the first thoracic ganglion. The external branches consist of two sets; one which com- mimicates with the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical, and first dorsal nerves, and one which accompanies the vertebral artery along the vertebral canal, forming the vertebral plexus. The plexus sends filaments to all the branches given olF by that artery, and communicates in the cranium with the filaments of the carotid plexus accompanying the branches of the internal carotid artery. The internal branch is the inferior cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus minoi". CARDIAC NERVES.â€”The cardiac nerves are three in number at each sideâ€”namely, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior cardiac nerve {nervus superfioialis cordis) proceeds from the lower part of the superior cervical ganglion ; it descends the neck behind the common carotid artery and parallel with the trachea, crosses the inferior thyroid artery, and running by the side of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, enters the chest. The nerve of the right side passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery and along the posterior aspect of the arteria innominata to the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve runs by the side of the left carotid artery, and crosses the arch of the aorta to the super- ficial cardiac plexus. In its course it receives branches from the pneiunogastric nerve and its external laryngeal branch, and sends filaments to the thyroid gland and trachea. The middle cardiac nerve (nervus cardiacus viagnus) proceeds from the middle cervical ganglion, or in its absence, from the cord of communication between the superior and inferior ganglion. It is the largest of the three nerves, and lies parallel with the recurrent laryngeal. At the root of the neck it divides into several branches, which pass some before and some behind the subclavian artery, communicates with the superior and inferior cardiac, pneumogastric, and recurrent nerves, and descends to the bifurcation of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus. On the left side this nerve passes between the left carotid and subclavian arteries to reach the chest, and terminates in the left side of the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerve (nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical gauglion, communicates with the recurrent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerves, passes behind the subclavian artery and descends to the front of the bifurcation of the trachea, to the deep cardiac plexus. The nerve of the left side often unites with the middle cardiac nerve, either before or immediately after they enter the thorax, the combined cord joining the deep cardiac ^^The SUPERFICIAL CARDIAC PLEXUS is situated immediately beneath the arch of the aorta and in front of the right pulinonary artery.

The superficial cardiac plexus gives off filaments which pans along the front of the left pulmonary artery to the root of the left lung, where they communicate with the anterior pulmonary plexus ; while the principal part of the plexus descends in the groove l)etweeii the pulmonary artery and aorta to the anterior longitudinal stdm^ of the heart, where it comes into relation with tlie anterior coronar}' artery, and becomes the anterior coronary plexus. At the base of the heart, the anterior coronary plexus receives several filaments from the deep cardiac j)lexus. Its branches are distributed to the substance of the heart in the course of the left or anterior coronary artery. The DEEP or GREAT CARDIAC PLEXUS is situated on the bifur- cation of the trachea, above the right pulmonary artery and behind the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta. It receives on the right side the three cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the same side, and the cardiac branches of the right pneumogastric and right recurrent nerve. On the left side it receives the middle and in- ferior cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the left side ; the cardiac branches of the left pneumogastric (excepting the inferior), and several cardiac branches from the left recurrent nerve. Filaments also pass to this plexus from the first and second thoracic ganglia of both sides. It will be noted that the deejj cardiac plexus receives all the cardiac filaments of the sympathetic, pneumogastric, and recurrent nerves, with the exception of the left superior cardiac of the sym- 23athetic (nervus superficialis cordis) and the inferior cervical cardiac of the left pneumogastric, these two nerves being destined to the superficial cardiac plexus. The branches of the deep cardiac plexus, proceeding from its right and left division, j)ass downwards to join the coronary arteries, and outwards to the pulmonary plexuses. From the right division of the plexus the branches j^roceed- before and behind the right pulmonary artery. Those which pass in front descend upon the trunk of the j)ulmonary artery to the left coronary artery, and help to form the anterior coronary jolexnsy those which pass behind the right pulmonary artery ai'e distributed to the right auricle ; a third set of filaments, proceeding from the right division of the deep cardiac plexus, follow the course of the right pulmonary artery to the anterior pulmonaiy j)lexus. From the left division of the plexus branches proceed beneath the arch of the aorta immediately to the right of tlie ligament of the ductus arteriosus to join the superficial cardiac plexus; others pass outwards with the ])ulmonary artery to the pulmonary j)lexus ; a few descend to the left auricle ; but the chief bulk pass on to the right coronary artery and form the posterior coronary jylexm. The anterior coronary plexus proceeds from tlie superficial cardiac plexus, and receives other filaments from the deep cardiacTHORACIC GANGLIA. 607 ! plexus. It is distributed with the branches of the coronary artery i on the anterior aspect of the heart. The posterior coronary plexus proceeds from the deep cardiac , plexus, and principally from its left division. It follows the course i of the arteries distributed to the posterior aspect of the heart. THORACIC PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The thoracic portion of the sympathetic nerve is the trunk of the sympathetic in its course through the cavity of the thorax. It lies by the side of the vertebral column on the heads of the ribs and inter- costal spaces, but at its lowest part comes into relation with the sides of the bodies of the two last dorsal vertebrae. The THORACIC GANGLIA (Fig. 348) are twelve in number at each side. They are flattened and tri- angular, or present the colour and irregular CARDIAC anA] AORTIC PULMONARY OBSOPHAGEAL in form, and peculiar reddish-grey pearly lustre of sym- pathetic ganglia in general; they rest against the heads of the ribs, and are covered by the pleura cos- talis. The first two ganglia and the last are usually the largest; the latter being situated on the side of the body of the last dorsal vertebra. Their branches are branches of communication and branches of distribution. Some ascending fila- ments from the first ganglion assist in tlie formation of the vertebral plexus. Tlie external or communicating branches, usually two in number for each ganglion, communicate with the intercostal nerves ; of these, one is greyish in colour, and is believed to pass from the gan- glion to the spinal nerve ; the other, of a wliite colour, probably is spinal in its origin, and is distriliuted with the sympathetic nerves. The internal or visceral branches proceeding from the five or six upper ganglia, are of small size, and distributed to the aorta heart, oesophagus, vertebral cohimn, and lungs.

Opposite 3, the eommiuiications with one of the dorsal nerves are shown.6o8 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. the lungs proceed from the third and fourth ganglia, and go to join the posterior pulmonary plexus. The visceral branches of the six lower ganglia unite to form the three splanchnic nerves. The great splanchnic nerve proceeds from the sixth dorsal gan- glion, and receiving the branches of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, passes downwards along the front of the vertebral column and, piercing the crus of the diaphragm, terminates in the semi- lunar ganglion. The lesser splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments which issue from the tenth and eleventh ganglia ; it pierces the crus of the dia- phragm, and joins the solar plexus near the middle line, frequently distributing branches also to the renal plexus. The third or renal splanchnic nerve proceeds from the last thoracic ganglion, and, piercing the diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus. Wlien absent, the place of this nerve is supplied by the lesser splanchnic. The semilunar ganglion is a large, irregular, gangliform body, pierced by numerous openings, and appearing like the aggregation of a number of smaller ganglia, having spaces between them. By its upper and posterior extremity each ganglion receives the corre- sponding great splanchnic nerve. It is situated by the side of the coeliac axis and root of the suj)erior mesenteric artery, and extends outwards to the supra-renal capsule. The ganglia communicate both above and below the coeliac axis and form a gangliform circle, from which branches pass off in all directions, like rays from a centre. Hence the entire circle has been named the solar plexus. The solar or epigastric plexus receives the great and lesser splanchnic nerves, the termination of the right pneumogastri nerve, some filaments from the right phrenic nerve, and sometimes one or two from the left. It sends forth numerous filaments which, accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches given o by the abdominal aorta. Thus we have derived from the solar plexus theâ€” Renal plexuses, Superior mesenteric plexus. Aortic jDlexus, Spermatic plexuses," Inferior mesenteric plexus. Phrenic, or diaphragmatic plexuses.

In tliis ganglion branches of the right phrenic nerve communicate with those of the sympathetic. The supra-renal plexuses are remarkable for their large size, and for a ganglion, which has received the name of ganglion supra- renale. . . The renal plexuses are large, and receive the third splancluuc nerve. They are joined by filaments from the aortic plexus and609 LUMBAK GANGLIA. lesser splanchnic nerve. The nerves passing to the kidney from each plexus are about fifteen or twenty in number ; they accompany the branches of the renal artery and have numerous small ganglia upon them. Branches are given off from the renal plexuses to the inferior vena cava and sjoermatic plexuses. The superior mesenteric plexus has several small ganglia at the root of the artery ; and its nerves, which are whiter than those of the other plexuses, form a kind of nervous sheath to the artery and its branches. The aortic plexus is a continuation of the solar plexus down- wards on the aorta, for the supply of the inferior branches of that trunk ; it receives also branches from the renal plexuses and lumbar ganglia. It is the source of origin of the inferior mesenteric plexus and jjart of the spermatic plexus, and terminates below in the hypogastric j)lexus. It likewise distributes branches on the infe- rior vena cava. The spermatic plexus is derived from the renal j)lexus, but receives filaments from the aortic plexus. The inferior mesenteric plexus is derived chiefly from the aortic plexus. LUMBAR PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The lumbar portion of the trunk of the sympathetic is situated on the vertebral column, close to the anterior border of the psoas magnus muscle. It is continuous above, under the edge of the diaphragm, with the thoracic portion of the nerve, and below it descends upon the sacrum, in front of the anterior sacral foramina, to the coccyx. It presents four small ganglia and an intermediate cord. The lumbar ganglia, four in number at each side, of a pearly- grey colour and fusiform shape, are situated on the anterior part of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrce. Tlie branches of the lumbar ganglia are branches of communi- cation and branches of distribution. The external or communicating branches, two or three in number from each ganglion, and longer than in the other regions communicate with the lumbar nerves. ' The internal or visceral branches consist of two sets: the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and join the aortic plexus ; the lower cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the promontory of the sacrum to form the hypogastric plexus. Â° The hypogastric plexus is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common ihac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral portions, inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexuses. 2 Q6ro SYMPATHETIC NERVES. PELVIC PLEXUSES. The inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexus on each side is placed in the lower part of the pelvic cavity, at the side of the rectum and bladder, extending in the female to the side of the vagina also. TIjc nerve filaments are derived from the hypogastric plexus ; they form frequent communications, and small ganglia are situated at the point- of intersection ; additional filaments are derived from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, and from the two upper sacral sym- j)athetic ganglia. The plexus gives off branches to all the pelvic viscera, which follow the distribution of the internal iliac artery, and receive the same names as the branches of that vessel wliicli they accompany. The nerves distributed to the bladder and vagina contain more nerve filaments derived from spinal nerves than tlic other branches of the plexus. The hsemorrhoidal plexus arises from the back of the pelvic plexus, and passes to the rectum, where it communicates with the superior hsemorrhoidal branches of the inferior mesenteric plexus. The vesical plexus comes from the front of the pelvic plexus. The nerves at first accompany the vesical arteries, but afterwards leave them, and penetrate the muscular coat to reach the mucous membrane. They are chiefly distributed to the base and sides ol' the bladder, and form secondary plexuses on the vasa defereutia and vesicnlfB seminales. The prostatic plexus is given off by the lower part of the pehdc plexus. It consists of nerves of considerable size, which are dis- tributed to the prostate gland, vesiculse seminales, and penis ; those passing to the latter organ are named cavernous nerves, being dis- tributed to the corpus cavernosum. The vaginal plexus, derived from the lower part of the pelvic plexus, is distributed to the mucous membrane and erectile tissue of the vagina. The uterine plexus, given oft' by the upper part of the pelvic plexus, accompanies the branches of the uterine artery, between the layers of the broad ligament, to the side of the uterus. The nerves are for the most part distributed to the mucous membrane of the lower part of the body and cervix, several large ganglia being found in the plexus by the side of the cervix ; other branches pass to the mnscidar coat, penetrating as far as the fundus. SACRAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The sacral ganglia are four or five in number at each side. They are situated on the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connection, although much smaller in size. 1 The external or communicating branches are two from each | ganglion, which pass outwards to communicate with, the anterior j sacral nerves and with the coccygeal nerve.OKGANS OF SENSE. 6n The internal or visceral branches communicate very freely with the inferior hypogastric plexuses, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azijgos. This ganglion serves to connect the extremities of the two sympathetic nerves. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum, and communicates with the coccygeal nerve. COCCYGEAL GLAND. Numerous branches from the ganglion impar are given off to a .peculiar reddish body situated on the anterior asj)ect of the tij) of the coccyx, and called by Luschka, by whom it was first described, the coccygeal gland. It consists of an aggregation of little lobules or granviles, and has been shown by Arnold to be formed by a number of dilated and tortuous arteries connected with the middle sacral artery. In the stroma of the organ scattered nerve cells are found. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense, the instruments l^y which the animal frame is brought into relation with surrounding nature, are five in number. Four of these organs are situated within the head ; viz., the appa- ratus of smell, sight, hearing, and taste ; the remaining organ, that of touch, is resident in the skin, and distributed over the surface of the body. The latter was described in the section on Histology, p. 63. THE NOSE AND NASAL FOSSiE. The organ of smell consists essentially of two parts : one external, the nose ; the other internal, the nasal fossae. The nose is the triangular pyramid which projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Superiorly it is con- nected with the forehead by means of a narrow bridge ; inferiorly, it presents two openings, tlie nostrils, which overhang the mouth' and are so constructed that the odour of all substances must be re- ceived by the nose before they can be introduced Avithin the Hps. The septum between the openings of the nostrils is called the columna. Their entrance is guarded by a number of stiff hairs (vibrissa) which project across the openings, and act as a filter in preventing the introduction of foreign substances, such as dust or insects, with the current of air intended for respiration. The anatomical elements of which the nose is composed are â€¢ I. Integument. 2. Muscles. 3. Bones. 4. Cartilages. 5. Mucous membrane. 6. Vessels and nerves. I. The integument forming the tip (lobulus) and wings (ate) of the nose is extremely thick and dense, so as to be with difiiculty separated from the cartilages. It is furnished with an abun-ORGANS OF SENSE. 6l2 the superior maxillary bones. nostril. dance of sebaceous glands, wliicli, l)y their oily secretion, protect tlic extremity of the nose under alternations of teiupei'atui-e. The selja- ceous matter of these glands becomes of a dai-k colour near the surface, from altered secretion, and also from attivaction of the cai - bonaceous matter floating in the atmosphere ; lience the spotted appearance which the tip of the nose presents in large cities. Wheij the integument is firndy compressed, the insjjissated .sebaceous secretion is squeezed out, and taking the cylindrical form of tlic excretory'ducts of the glands, has tlie appearance of small while maggots (grubs ; comedones) with black heads. 2. The muscles are brought into view by reflecting the iutegu- ment; they are the pyramidalis nasi, compressor nasi, dilatator naris, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and depressor alse nasi. The\- have been already described with the muscles of the face. 3. The bones of the nose areâ€”the nasal, and nasal processes of tlie superior maxillary. 4. The cartilages give form and stability to the nose, providing, at the same time, by their elasticity, against injuries. They are fivu in number, namely, theâ€” Cartilage of the septum, Two lateral cartilages, 1 Two alar cartilages.

The inner portion is loosely con- nected with the same part of the opposite cartilage, to form the columna. It is expanded and thickened at the point of the nose, to constitute the lobe; and on the side makes a curve corresponding with that of the ala. This curve is prolonged backwards and doM ii- wards in the direction of the posterior border of the ala by three or Fig. 349. â€” The cartilages of the nose. i. One of the nasal bones. 2.

The lower margin and back part of the ala of the nose is devoid of cartilage, and is com- posed of areolar and elastic tissue to which the skin is closely ad- herent ; it resembles the lobule of the ear. 5. The mucous mem- brane, lining the inte- rior of the nose, is con- externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossae within. Around the en- trance of the nostrils it is provided with the vibrissa;. 6. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the nose areâ€”the lateral nasal from the facial, the artery of the septum from the superior coronary, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic and the infra-orbital. Its nerves areâ€”the facial, infra-orbital, infra-trochlear, and nasal branch of the ojihthalmic. NASAL FOSS^. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The nasal fossae are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded supe- riorhj by the lateral cartilages of the nose, and by the nasal bones, ethmoid, and sphenoid ; inferiorly by the hard palate ; and, in the middle line, they are separated by a bony and cartilaginous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossae will be found at p. 129. On the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three pro- jecting processes, termed spongy bones. The two superior belong to the ethmoid, the inferior is a separate bone. In the fresh fossse these are covered with mucous membrane, and serve to increase the surface of that membrane by their prominence and convoluted form. The space intervening between the superior and middle spongy bone is the superior meatus ; the space between the middle and inferior, Fig. 350. â€” The cartilages and bones of the nose viewed from the side. 1.

It should, however, be noted that two 1 of the openings there mentioned, namelv, the spheno-palatine and ! anterior palatine foramina, are not seen" in the recent state, being ! covered by the mucous membrane. In the position of the anterior { palatine canal there is, not unfrequently, a small csecal tube, the remains of a structure present in the man during embryonic life, and called the organ of Jacohson. This organ is present in mammals generally in adult life, and appears as a double tube in the nasal septum, supported by a plate of cartilage, the cartilage of Jacohson. â–  The mucous membrane of the nasal fossa3 is called j^ituitary, or Schneiclcrian; the former name being derived from the nature of its secretion, the latter from Schneider, who was the first to show that the secretion of the nose proceeded from the mucous membrane, and not from the brain, as was previously imagined. It is closely adherent to the periosteum, constituting what is called a fibro- mucous membrane, and is continuous with the general gastro - pulmonary mucous membrane. From the nasal fosspe it may be traced throiigh the openings in the meatuses, into the sphenoidal and ethmoidal cells ; into the frontal sinuses ; into the antrum maxillare ; through the nasal duct to the surface of the eye, where it is con- tinuous with the conjunctiva ; along the Eustacliian tulles into the tym- panum and mastoid cells, to which it and through the posterior nares into the pharynx and mouth, and tlience through the lungs and alimen- tary canal. Bigelow has pointed out that the mucous membrane covering the middle and inferior turbinated bones contains a true cavernous structure, similar to that of the corpus cavernosum penis. The cavernous spaces are irregular in shajje and variable in size; they approach quite near to the surface of the mucous membrane and the bone, and they communicate freely with eacli other. The surface of the membrane is furnished with laminated squa- mous epithelium near the aperture of the nares, and with ciliated columnar epithelium in the respiratory tract; in the latter it is also furnished with mucous glands, which are especially numerous on the septum at its posterior part. The mucous membrane whicli covers the upper and middle turl)inated bones and the up])er jiart of the se])tum (the olfactory tract) is of a darker colour, softer and more pulpy, its epithelium is columnar and non-ciliated, and tlio Fig. 351.â€”A section of the mucous membrane in the olfactory re- gion. 1.

It also contains numerous glands, but these the tract. the columnar epithelium are cer- tain peculiar rod-like bodies, each of which is connected with or grows out fi'om a nucleated cell (olfactory cell), while from' the deeper surface of the same cell proceeds a fine thread, which is supposed to be continuous with a filament of the olfactory nerve. They bear a striking resemblance to the retinal rods and cones.

The filaments of the olfactory nerves dift'er from those of the cere- Ijral and spinal nerves generally, in being devoid of the medullary sheath ; they form a fine anastomotic network, and probably ter- minate in the olfactory cells above described. In the frog the olfac- tory fibres have l^een observed breaking up into a bundle of fine, pale, varicose fibrils which perforate the mucous membrane, and each of these appears then to join an olfactory cell (Schultze and Kollikcr).

OEGAN OF VISION. Tlie organ of vision consists of the two eyes and their connections with the brain. The eyes are situated in the orbital fossae, on each side of the upper part of the face ; they are freely moval)le in consequence of being surrounded by fat and contained in a smooth fibrous capsule {capsule of Tenon), and have numerous muscles to perform their movements. They are protected from external violence by being situated in cavities with osseous walls, and have in front both6i6 ORGANS OF SENSE. cleansing and protective apparatus against the intrusion of foreign bodies. The fossae in which the eyes are situated have their axe^ directed outwards, but the eyes themselves are directed much uiowt forwards, varying, however, in their direction with the distance oi- nearness of the object looked at, their axes being parallel in looking at distant objects, but converging slightly when near objects are viewed. The optic nerves follow the direction of the orbits, and therefore enter the eyeballs on their nasal side. We shall in the first place give a short account of those structures which, although not essential to vision, are provided for the protec- tion of the anterior part of the eye. These appendages of the eye {tutamina oculi) areâ€”the eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, caruncula lachrymalis, and lachrymal apparatus. APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. The eyebrows (supercilia) are two prominent arches of integu- ment which overlie the superciliary ridges of the frontal bone. Fig. 353.â€”Appendagesof tbe eye. i. Supe- rior tarsal plate. 2.

They are covered with short, stiff hairs directed obliquely upwards and outwards, and are connected beneath with the orbicularis pal- pebrarum, occipito-frontalis, and corrugator supercilii muscles, bv which they are moved. They serve to shade the eyes from too vivid licrht to protect them from the entrance of dust from above, and to carry the moisture from the forehead on to the temple and lateral parts of the face, and so prevent its entering the eyes. The eyelids {pcdfehrce) are two movable folds, which serve by their closure to protect the anterior part of the eye from injury, or to exclude the light, as during sleep. When open they have an elliptical fissure between them {rima palpebrarum), and it is upon the size of this that the ai^^arent size of the eye depends. The angles of junction of the two lids are called canthi. The outer canthus i acute, so that but a small space is lett between the lidsj the inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance towards the nose and a S^^^^^^^^^^ sjace called lacus lachrymalis is left betweenEYELIDS. 617 the lids in this situation. At the commencement of this space, upon the edge of each of the lids, is a small angular projection, the lachrymal papilla ; and at the apex of each papilla is a small orifice, punctum lachrymale, the commencement of the lachrymal canaliculus. The eyelids have entering into their structure, integument, orbi- cularis palpebrarum muscle, tarsal plates, palpebral ligament, Mei- bomian glands, and conjunctiva. The areolar tissue of the skin of the eyelids is remarkable for its looseness, and the absence of adipose substance ; it is particularly liable to serous infiltration. The fibres of the orbicularis are for the most part thin and pale, but a thicker band of fibres has been found internal to the eye- lashes, constituting the ciliary muscle of Kiolan. The tarsal plates are two thin plates of dense connective tissue, al)out an inch in length, which give form and support to the eyelids. The ihpper plate is of a semilunar form, thicker in the middle than at its extremities ; its lower border is broad and flat, its upper thin, and gives attachment to the levator palpebrse muscle and the palpebral ligament. The lower plate, narrower than the upper, is situated in the substance of the lower lid. Its upper border is flat, and corresponds with the flat edge of the upper plate ; the loAver border is attached to the palpebral ligament. Near the inner canthus, the tarsal plates terminate at the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, and are attached to the margin of the orbit by the tendo oculi. At their outer extremity they terminate at a short distance from the canthus, and are retained in position by a fibrous band which is j^art of the paljDebral ligament, and is called the external tarsal ligament. The palpebral ligament (broad tarsal ligament) is a fibrous mem- brane which is firmly attached to the periosteum around the margin of the orbit, and to the internal free edges of the tarsal plates. It is thick and dense for the outer half of the orbit, but becomes thin to its inner side. Its use is to retain the tarsal jjlates in their place, and give supi)ort to the lids. The Meibo- mian glands are emljedded in grooves on the under sur- face of each tar- sal plate, and are distinctlyrseen on examining the inner aspect of the lids. They have the appearance of parallel strings of pearls, about thirty in Fig. 354.â€”Meibomian glands, as seen upon the inner side of the eyelids, i. Upper lid. 2. Lower lid. 3, 3. Conjunctiva. 4.

They correspond in length with the breadth of the plate, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clusters of glan- dular vesicles open; the latter are so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out on the edges of the lids. Occasionallj'^ an arch is formed between two of the follicles, pro- ducing a graceful ap- pearance. The tubes are lined Ijy a stratified epithelium, and the gland vesicles by cubi- cal cells ; the lumen of the gland is usually filled up with the fatty secretion and partly disintegrated epithe- lial cells. The edges of the eyelids are furnished with strong, short, curved hairs, called eyelashes (cilia), ar- ranged in two to four rows ; those of the upper lid curving up- wards, and those of the lower downwards, so as not to interlace Avith each other in the closure of the lids, and prove an iuqiedi- ment to the opening of the eyes. Near the point of emergence of the eyelashes are the openings of the rjlands of Moll, arranged in Fkj. 355.â€”Vertical antero-posteriov section of upper eyelid. a. Skin. b.

In structure they resemble sweat ducts, being composed of a bent tube, lined with cubical epithelial cells. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It covers the whole of its anterior surface, and is reflected on the lids so as to form their internal layer. It is continuous with the general gastro-. pulmonary mucous membrane, and sympathises in its affections, as may be observed in various diseases. From the surface of the eye it may be traced through the lachrymal ducts into the lachrymal gland, along the edges of the lids it is continuous with the mucous lining of the Meibomian glands, and at the inner angle of the eye it may be followed through the lachrymal canaliculi into the lach- rymal sac, and thence downwards through the nasal duct into the inferior meatus of the nose. Wliere it covers the cornea the conjunctiva is thin, transparent, and inseparable from the corneal substance; it consists of stratified eiDithelial cells alone. In the conjunctiva at the circumference of the cornea a plexus of vessels is found, but this never extends entirely across the latter. The conjunctiva over the sclerotic is also thin and transparent, but is loosely applied and glides freely over the surface of the eyeball ; it is freely supplied with blood by an irregularly disposed plexus of vessels. These vessels are readily distinguished from those of the sub-conjunctival tissue, as the latter radiate in nearly straight lines from the circumference of the cornea, and do not glide over the surface of the sclerotic on pressure. The sclerotic conjunc- tiva consists of stratified epithelium supported by a sub-epithelial layer, composed of white fibrous and elastic tissue, in the meshes of which numerous lymph corpuscles are seen. The palpebral conjunctiva is thick, opaque, and red ; it presents papillae on its surface, and very closely resembles ordinary mucous membrane in structure, but the papillcC are limited to the part below the level of the tarsal plate. It consists of a stratified epi- thelium, supported by an elastic submucous tissue ; in the latter, numerous simple follicles are found, and near the reflected portion, certain racemose glands, similar in structure to the lachrymal gland. Bruch has described masses of lymphoid tissue as occupying the conjunctiva of the fornix conjunctiva), and Henle has named these masses trachoma glands; it apj^ears doubtful, however, if they are present in normal conditions of the conjunctiva. Between the eyelids and ball of the eye the conjunctiva forms an up])er and lower fold, which are called the superior and inferior palpebral folds (retro-tarsal folds), the upper being tlie larger ; they are now frequently spoken of as the upper and lower fornix con- junctivae. The caruncula lachrymalis is the small reddish body which occu])ies the lacus h^chrymalis at the inner canthus of the eye. In health it presents a Ijright pink tint; in sickness it loses its colour620 ORGANS OF SENSE. and becomes pale. It is studded with fine hairs, and consists of a dozen racemose sebaceous glands, with some few fat cells intei- mingled, a few fibres of unstriped muscle, and a covering of mucous membrane. Immediately to the outer side of the caruncula is a slight dupli- cature of the conjunctiva, called plica semilunaris ; it is simply a fold of conjunctiva, and is the rudiment of the third lid or mem- brana niditans of Ijirds. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The eyelids and other appendages of the eye are supplied with blood by the nasal, palpebral, and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic, and the angular branch of the facial artery. The nerves are derived from the facial and fifth nerves. LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. The lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland with its excretory ducts ; the puncta lachrymalia and lachrymal canalicidi; the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. The lachrymal gland is situated at the upper end and outer part of the orbit, in a dejsression of the orbital plate of the frontal bone, with the periosteum of which bone it is connected by fibrous bands ; by its under surface it is in relation with the globe of the eye, and the superior and external rectus muscles. It is oval in shape, about three-quarters of an inch long, convex on its upper and concave on its under surface. The anterior portion is frequently sejsarated from the rest by a slight depression, and is then described as the 'palpebral portion {accessory gland of Rosenmiiller); it is situated in the ujiper eyelid, and extends downwards to the suj^erior margin of the tarsal cartilage. The gland consists of a number of aggregated racemose glands similar in structure to the salivary and mucous glands. The secretion is conveyed away by from eight to twelve small ducts whicli run for a short distance beneath the conjunctiva, and open on its surface by separate orifices, about a twentieth of an inch apart, the greater number in the fold above the outer canthus, and two of them in the fold below. The lachrymal canaliculi commence at the minute openings, puncta lachrymalia, seen on the lachrymal ]mpiUa3 of the lids at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymalis, and proceed inwards to the lachrymal sac, where tliey terminate beneath a valvular semilunar fold of mucous membrane {valve of HuschJce). The superior duct is the narrower and longer of the two ; it at first ascends and then suddenly turns inwards towards the sac, forming an abrupt angle. The inferior duct forms the same kind of angle by descending at first and then turning abruptly inwards. Both canals are dilated where they are bent. A valve-like projection {valve of Foltz) has been described as projecting from the side into the interior of the vertical portion of each canaliculus near the punctum lachrymale ; it seems to be sufiicient to close the tube completely when it is flattened by the orbicidaris and tensor tarsi muscles. It no doubt621 GLOBE OF THE EYE. prevents the tears being driven back wlien sucli pressure is applied, as in winking ; and as a consequence they are then driven forward into the lachrymal sac. The two fasciculi of the tensor tarsi muscle are inserted into the canaliculi, and serve to draw them iuAvards and compress them. The lachrymal sac is the dilated upper extremity of the nasal duct. It is lodged in the groove of the lachrymal bone, and is often distinguished internally from the nasal duct by a semilunar or cir- cular valve. The sac consists of mucous membrane, but is covered in and retained in place by a fibrous expansion, derived from the tendon of the orbicularis, which is inserted into the ridge on the lachrymal bone ; it is also covered by the tensor tarsi muscle, which arises from the same ridge, and when in action makes pressure on the lachrymal sac. The nasal duct is a short canal, about three-quarters of an inch in length, directed downwards, backwards, and a little outwards to the inferior meatus of the nose, into which it opens. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous with the conjunctiva above, and with the j)ituitary membrane of the nose below ; it frequently forms an imperfect valve (valve of Hasner) at the lower opening of the duct. The mucous membrane of tbe canaliculi is covered by a stratified scaly epithelium, and that of the lachrymal sac and nasal duct by columnar ciliated cells. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The lachrymal gland is supplied with blood by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery, with nerves by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic, and the orbital branch of the superior maxillary. GLOBE OF THE EYE. The globe or ball of the eye is irregularly spheroidal in form, liaving the segment of a smaller sphere (the cornea) projecting from it anteriorly, and being slightly flattened behind. Its transverse diameter is about 24 mm., the horizontal 23.5 mm., and the vertical 23.1 mm. Around the eyeball is a layer of fascia which separates it from the fat of the orbit, and enables it to move smoothly ; this is the so-called tunica vaginalis oculi, or capsule of Tenon; it is pierced by the tendons of the straight and oblique muscles, and is connected with the sclerotic by means of delicate fibrous threads. The globe of the eye is composed of a strong external fibrous coat, called the sclerotic, with its clear anterior portion, the cornea; a middle vascular and pigmentary covering, the choroid, which is also continued forwards to form a partition, the iris; and an internal nervous tunic, the retina. It encloses certain refracting media, for the purpose of bringing rays of light to a focus on the retina ; these are the vitreous and aqueoxhs humour, and the cnjstalline lens. External Tunicâ€”Scleroticâ€”The sclerotic ((r/(X7;p6?,hard) forms the outer covering of the posterior four-fifths of the globe of the622 ORGANS OF SENSE. eye. It i.s coutiimouw posteriorly witli the outer slieatli of tlie optic nerve derived from the dura mater, and is pierced by the ciliary nerves and arteiies. Anteriorly its hbres are continuous with the transparent ones of the cornea. It is thickest behind, ljut is strengthened in front l)y an expansion of the I'ecti tendons, forming the tunica albuginea; this is covered for the greater part of its extent by the conjunctiva, and by reason of its bi'illiant wliiteness gives occasion to the common expression, "the Avhite of the eye." In structure the sclerotic is found to consist of white fibrous tissue, witli some feAv elastic fibres and a great number of stellar nucleated cells ; the fibres are arranged in bvmdles which run Ijoth longitudi- nally and transversely, the superficial layers being chiefly longitu- dinal. The inner surface of the sclerotic is in contact with the choroid, and is connected to it by means of numerous tlireads of FifJ. 356.â€”General diagr,im of the eye. i. Cornea. 1'.

The lamina fusca is lined by a layer of endothelial cells and foi-ms the outer wall of the peri- choroidal lymph space. At the entrance of the optic nerve a tliin cribriform lamella, lamina cribrosa,* takes the place of the sclerotic ; it is pierced by a number of minute openings for the passage of the nervous filaments, and in the centre by a larger opening called porus opticus, for the entrance to the eyeball of the arteria cen- tralis retiufe. The cornea {comeios, horny) is the transparent prominent layer which constitutes the anterior fifth of the globe of the eye. When * The lamina cribrosa is generally described as the continuation of the sclerotic, but ir, seems more probable (as Dr. T. Reid suggests) that it is continuous with the cSd ; indeed, in an inflamed eyeball the fibres of the lamina have been d.stmctly traced into the choroid.623 CORNEA. examined from tlie exterior, its vertical diameter is seen to be about one-sixteentli shorter than its transverse, in consequence of the over- lapping above and below of the margin of the sclerotic ; on the in- terior its outline is circular. It is continuous with the sclerotic, and is connected \vith the iris, choroid, and ciliary processes. The thickness of the cornea is about one millimetre ; it is generally the same throughout, except at the perijihery, where it becomes a little thinner. Structure.â€”The cornea is divisible into four layers ; these are, I. Conjunctival epithelium ; 2. Anterior limiting layer ; 3. Cornea propria ; and 4. Membrane of Descemet or Demours. The first of these has been already described. The anterior limiting layer (anterior elastic lamina of Bowman) is a transparent and apparently structureless layer, having an average thickness of from ijo^oo T2W ^^^^^^ > devoid of laminae and corneal corpuscles, but otherwise is indistinguishable from the next layer, with which it is connected by fine threads running into the sub- stance of the latter. The cornea propria forms the bulk of the cornea. It consists of numerous layers of delicate transparent fibres, continuous externally mth those of the opaque sclerotic ; the fibres are collected into bundles, separated from each other by a ground substance similar to that in other connective tissues. Between the strata nucleated cells are found, which freely anasto- mose with each other, and appear to be stellate in sections made parallel to the surface of the cornea. The cells lie in spaces in the ground substance, which correspond to them accurately in size and shape. The spaces can be easily made out by painting the tissue with nitrate of silver ; they are generally held to be lymph chamiels. The membrane of Descemet or Demours forms the j)osterior layer of the cornea, and lines the chamber of the aqueous humour ; it con- sists of an elastic and an epithelial layei'. The elastic layer (jjosterior elastic lamina of Bowman) is about -006 mm. in thickness ; it is highly elastic, and when partially de- tached tends to curl up. The epithelium consists of a single layer of irregularly shaped nucleated cells. At the edges, the membrane of Descemet breaks up into threads, some of which are continued on to the iris to form the ligamentum pectina- tum, others terminate in the inner wall of the canal of Schlemm, and some few are connected with the ciliary muscle. The pro- cesses which pass to the iris are covered by a single layer of cells of the same kind as those lining the membrane of Descemet, but, as the cells do not pass over the intervals between â– "â– '"^''"T'nnn m F'o. 357-â€”A vertical sec- tion of the cornea of an adult, showing the layers of which it is composed.ORGANS OF SENSE. 624 the strands, small apertures are left, called the spaces of Fontana, thi'ough which the anterior chandler coniniunicates with the canal of Schlenim. MIDDLE TUNICâ€”The second or )iiiddle tunic of the eyeball is formed by the choroid, ciliary rimscle, and iris, the ciliary procenaen being apx)endages developed from its inner surface! The choroid (x^pinv el'So?, like the chorion, that is to say, " vas- cular ") is of a rich chocolate-brown colour on its external surface, and of a darker tint within. It is connected to the sclerotic by means of the fine areolar tissue called lamina fusca, by vessels and' nerves. Internally, it is in simple contact with the retina. It is pierced posteriorly for the passage of the optic nerve, and is connected ante- riorly with the iris, ciliary processes, and the line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic. The choroid is conrposed of three layers. The external layer is composed of fine elastic fibres arranged in lamellEe, and lined Pio. 358. â€” Dissection of tlie eyeball, showing its second tunic, and the mode of dis- tribution of the venae vorti- cosae of the choroid, i.

This layer is called the lamina supra-choroidea. The middle or venous layer consists princijially of veins, the smaller branches of which are arranged in whorls (vasa vorticosa) round the chief trunks, four or five in number. Between the meshes of the veins are stellate i^igmentary cells, which are con- nected together so as to form a fine web. The inner or arterial layer of the choroid or chorio-capillaris (tunica Buyschiana) is formed principally of the ramifications of minute arteries, whidi form a complete network with veiy fine meshes. It is reilectud inwards so as to form the ciliary processes. A structureless transparent membrane (memhrane of Bruch) has been described as lying lietween the chorio-capillaris and the pig- mentary layer of the retina. At the junction of the sclerotic and cornea with the clioroid and iris, a small venous canal is found, called the canal of SchlemmlEIS. 625 (sinus circnlaris iridis) ; it communicates witli the venous trunks of tlie choroid, and by the spaces of Fontana with the anterior chamber of the aqueous. This canal seems to be more constant in the lower animals than in man, and has been observed to be very large in the negro ; its place is frequently taken by several small veins. The iris (iris, a rainbow) is so named from its variety of colours in different individuals ; it consists of muscular and fibrous tissue with pigmentary cells, the latter being interspersed through- out the tissues, as well as forming a distinct posterior' layer. "The colour of the iris depends on the quantity and arrangement of the pigment cells ; when the cells are in small quantity they are chiefly confined to the poste- rior layers, and the iris as seen from the front has a blue colour ; but when in greater quantity, they are also dispersed through the tissues, and a grey or broAvn colour is the result. By its outer edge the iris is con- nected with the choroid and sclerotic ; by its inner it forms the boundary of a circular opening ca'lled the jmpil; its anterior surface looks towards the cornea and is free ; its posterior, looking towards the ciliary processes and lens, is in contact with them throiighout greater part of its extent. The stroma of the iris consists of fibres of connective tissue intermixed with cells, the former being arranged radially towards the pupil and circularly near the outer margin. The cells are very numerous, and for the most part much l:)ranched ; many of them contain pigment, both in the body of the cell and in the processes. The muscular tissue is of the unstriped variety. It consists of two sets of fibres, one of which is disposed circularly roimd the aper- ture of the pupil, so as to form a sphincter, the contraction of which will diminish the size of the opening; the other set is gathered into numerous bands which radiate from tlie pupillary margin to the circumference, aud serve by their contraction to dilate the pupil. The pigmentary layer, situated on the posterior surface of the iris, is of a deep purple tint, and hence lias received the name of uvea (like a grape); it is continuous with the inner layer of the choroid. It consists of deejily pigmented polygonal cells, and is 2 R Pic 359-- Anterior segment of a transverse section of tlie globe of the eye, seen from within. I.

On its anterior surface the fibres of the iris have mingled with them some elastic fibres continuous with those of the memlirane of Descemet, and are so arranged as to produce a festooned appearance. These festoons are very distinct in the eye of the ox and sheep; they form the ligamentum pectinatum. The epithelial cells of the membrane of Descemet are continued over the anterior surface of the iris. The blood-vessels of the iris are numerous, and their outer coat is intimately connected with the fibrous stroma; the arteries are derived from the long and anterior ciliary arteries, and from the circulus iridis major of the ciliary processes. In the foetus a delicate vascidar membrane closes in the pupil (mem- hrana pupillaris) ; it disappears about the seventh or eighth month. The nerves come from the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion, and from the long ciliary branch of the nasal. After forming a plexus near the ciliary margin of the iris, they divide into twigs which are distributed to the muscular fibres and anterior sur- face. The ciliary pro- cesses are formed by the plication of the anterior part of the ciliary region of the choroid.

They consist of about eighty triangular folds, about one-third of which are smaller than the rest, and are interspersed at irregular intervals. The summits of the lai-ger processes have upon them smaller, secondary processes, varying greatly in their number, size,CILIARY MUSCLE. 627 and shape. Tliey have much the same structure as the choroid, and are composed of a vascular network and an internal pigmentary layer. Their periphery is connected with the ciliary muscle ; the central border is free, and nearly reaches the circumference of the lens ; the anterior surface is continuous with the uvea : the posterior surface receives the folds of the suspensory ligament of the lens. Each of the larger folds measures about of an inch in length, and of an inch in depth. The ciliary muscle (formerly described as the ciliari/ ligament) is situated internally to the canal of Schlemm. It forms a greyish- white ring round the anterior part of the choroid, and is found to consist of unstriped muscular tissue, the fibres of which are con- nected in front with the inner surface of the sclerotic, and the fibres of the membrane of Descemet; they pass inwards and backwards, and are attached to the choroid opposite and beyond the ciliary pro- cesses. Besides these fibres there are others, situated more inter- FiG. 361.â€”Section through the ciliary processes and periphery of the iris. a. Radiating fibres of the ciliary muscle, b.

The circular fibres are most developed in hypermetrojjic eyes, and are very scanty or altogether absent in those which are myopic (Iwanoff). INTERNAL TUNIC.â€”This consists of the retina, with its con- tinuation forwards, called the pars ciliaris retince. The retina is the inner nervous tunic of the eye, and that on which the images of external objects are produced. It is in contact by its external surface with the choroid, and by its internal surface with the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour. It is firmly attached to the back part of the eye by means of the retinal artery and fibres of the optic nerve Avhich enter it, but is loosely applied to the inside of the choroid thr'oughout the rest of its extent. It terminates anteriorly, a little behind the ciliary processes, in a festooned edge, the ora serrata; but from this edge there areORGAN OF VISION. 628 Fig, 362.â€”Cells of the pars ciliaris retina;. continued forwards over the ciliary processes to the base of th(- iris, some peculiar, elongated, nucleated cells, constituting the furn ciliaris retince. In the fresh eye the retina is of a pale pink colour, and is translucent, but it soon becomes opaque and yellowish, especially â€¢when in contact with fluids. At the back part of the retina, nearly in the axis of the eye, is a spot of a golden-yellow colour-â€” macula lutea (called by Soemmering lirnhis liUeus) ; it is elliptical in form, with a long diameter of about ^2 of an inch, and short diameter of an inch. In the middle of this is a depression, fovea centralis, where, the retina being thinned, the pigmentary matter of the choroid is seen through ; hence it has the appear- ance of being a fora- men, and was so de- scribed by Soemmering. This is the most sensi- tive spot of the retina, and being placed nearly in the axis of the eye, receives the image of that part of an object to which the eye is directed, and of which the most vivid impres- sion is obtained. About of an inch to the inner .side of the macula is the entrance of the optic nerve. Here there is a slight elevation (colliculus nervi optici), Avith a cupped centre, perforated by the arteria centralis retinae ; the artery ujDon entering imme- diately breaking up into branches. This is the only part of the retina from which the power of vision is absent. The retina is thickest pos- teriorly, in the immediate vicinity of the optic nerve, where it has a thickness of jJu of an inch, but it thins as it passes forwards, and near tlie ora serrata measures only o>,o of an inch. Structure.â€”On the outer surface, the retina is formed by a single layer of hexagonal cells loaded with pigment, and constituting tlu' Fig. 363.â€”Vertical section of the coats of the eye at the point of entrance of the optic nerve, d.

In some animals this is replaced by a layer of considerable extent and of metallic brilliance, called tapetum; it appears to con- sist chiefly of connective tissue. The next layer of the retma (bacillary layer) was formerly called Jacob's membrane, from its having been described by Dr. Jacob ; it consists of a number of peculiar rod-like bodies, with which are mingled others with bulbous inner extremities, called cones. The relative proportion of rods and cones difters in different parts of the retinaâ€”thus, m the yellow spot the rods are absent, and the cones are attenuated, elongated, and crowded ; in the neighbourhood of the ora serrata, on the other hand, the rods are the most numerous, and the cones are interspersed at considerable intervals (Fig. 364). The middle layers consist of several strata of corpuscles and mole- cules, Avhich, upon minute examination, are found to be divisible intoâ€”(i) an outer stratum, consisting of oval corpuscles of small size, many of which are nucleated {outer granular layer); they have been divided into cone granules and rod granules, according as they Fig. 365.â€”Pigmentary cells of retina, a. Seen from the surface, b. Seen from the side. c. Relation of retinal rods to the pigment. are connected with one or other of the elements of the bacillary layer ; the former are larger than the latter, and are closely con- nected to the bases of the cones, while the rod granules are small, transversely striated, and distinct from the bases of .the rods; (2) next to this a very narrow band of fine molecules {outer molecular layer); and (3) internal to this a layer of larger corpuscles, all of which seem to be nucleated {inner granular layer). The granules of the third layer are of two kinds, namely, (a) large cells with two processes or poles; and (/3) pale-edged oval nuclei, which are less numerous, and clearly belong to the connective-tissue stroma. The inner layers of the retina consist in part of the expanded fibres of the optic nerve, and in part of superadded molecules and nerve cells. Immediately in contact with the inner granular layer above described is a stratum of fine molecules {inner molecular layer), and next to this one or two rows of multipolar nerve cells, while, most internally, the fibres of the optic nerve form a thin layer. These structures are supported by a network of connective tissue, which is condensed so as to form a limiting membrane on the inside630 ORGAN OF VISION. of the nerve fibres, and, externally, at the base of the bacillary layer. This stromal tissue also contains a large number of fibres which run vertically to the surface of the retina, and have been named the rods of Miiller. These appear to be connected externally with I'ods and cones ; some few. have been observed to join the cells of the granular layers, and some have been traced into the inter- nal limiting membrane. It is supposed that these elements connect the rods and cones with the fibres of the optic nerve, being connected intermediately with the cells of the granular layers and the multipolar cells above described ; hitherto, how- ever, this complete chain has not been satisfactorily demon- strated. At the yellow spot the retina becomes very much thinned, and the layers of which it is com- posed are one by one suppressed, until in the centre of the spot only a crowded layer of attenu- ated cones, a few cells of the outer granular layer, and a few nerve cells arranged like pave- ment epithelium, remain. At the entrance of the otitic nerve, on the other hand, the bacillary and granular layers are absent, and the layer of nerve cells exists only at the border of the colli- culus ; the nerve fibres are, how- ever, numerous, and form a very thick layer. Vessels.â€”The arteries of the retina are chiefly derived from the arteria centralis retinae, which enters the eye in the centre of the optic nerve, and breaks up immediately into branches, ramifying for the most part in the inner or nervous layers of the retina, the outer layers being entirely devoid of blood-vessels. The veins have a similar distribution, and terminate in the ophthalmic vein. The optic nerve and its terinination, the optic disc, receive only a few very fine branches from the arteria centralis, being chiefly supplied by vessels running inside tlie sheath and derived from the short ciliary arteries.

The refracting media of the eye are the aqueous and vitreous humours, and the lens; but in conjunction with these we shall also describe the suspensory ligament and capsule of the lens. The aqueous humour fills up the space between the cornea and the capsule of the lens with its suspensory ligament; it is a weakly albuminous fluid, with an alkaline reaction, and a specific gravity very little greater than that of water. The anterior chamber is the space intervening between the cornea in front, and the iris and pupil behind. The posterior chamber was formerly described as the space between the posterior surface of the iris and pupil in front, and the ciliary processes, suspensory ligament, and lens behind,â€”but it is now known that the iris at the edge of the pupil is m absolute Fig. 367.â€”Section through yellow spot of the retina, a.

The vitreous humour forms the principal bulk of the globe of the eye, and supports the delicate retina internally. It is a trans- parent and highly albuminous substance, enclosed in a delicate homo- geneous membrane, the hyaloid membrane. Hannover supposed that septa of the hyaloid membrane also formed cavities for the con- tained fluid, but microscopic examination has shown that such is not the case in the adult, though there undoubtedly are fibres in the centre of the vitreous in the foetus. Scattered through its substance are a number of corpuscles of various shapes and sizes, many ex- hibiting amoeboid movements, and near the periphery stellate and spindle-shaped cells have been described. The centre of the vitreous is traversed by a minute canal (canal of Stilling) extending from632 ORGAN OF VISION. the optic-iierve entrance to the back of the lens; it is filled with clear fluid. Anteriorly the hyaloid is connected with the posterior part of the capsnle of the lens, while a thickened prolongation of it forms the suspensory ligament of the lens. The crystalline lens is situated im- mediately behind the pupil, and sur- rounded Ijy the ciliary processes, which neai/ly reach its margin. It is more convex on its posterior than its anterior surface, and is embedded in the anterior part of the vitreous humour, from which it is separated l)y the hyaloid memljrane. It is invested by a peculiar transparent and elastic membrane, the capsule of tit e lens, Avhich is thicker in front than be- hind, in consequence of the suspensory ligament joining it on that aspect. The capsule is connected with the lens in front by means of a single layer of "granular and nucleated polygonal cells," which, at its edge, become con- tinuous with the nucleated fibres of the The lens is re- tained in its place by means of the susijensory ligament, to be presently described. Structure.â€”^The lens consists of con- centric layers, of which the external are soft, the next firmer, and the central form a hardened nucleus. They are best demon- strated by boiling or by immersion in alcohol, when they are easily separated from each other. Another division of the lens takes place at the same time : it splits into three triangular seg- ments, having the sharp edge directed towards the centre, and the l)ase towards the circumference. The concentric lamina? are composed of minute hexagonal filires, united with each other by means of irregularly serrated edges, the serrations of which accu- rately fit into each other. Some of the superficial fibres possess nuclei, which are usually arranged in regular zones, and are con- tinuous in series with the nuclei of the cells between the capsule and lens anteriorly (Babuchin). The suspensory ligament of the lensâ€”Retzius (Zonule of Zinn, Zonula ciliaris)â€”is a firm, transparent membrane, passing froni the fore-part of the circumference of the lens to join the hya- loid membrane nearly opposite the ora serrata. It is gathered up into numerous pleats which fit into the depressions between the ciliary processes, and when withdrawn carry Avith them some of the pigment which covers those j)rocesses. Structurally, it is found to consist of pale longitudinal parallel fibres, resembling those of Pig. 368.â€”The crystalline leii.s I.

These fibres spread out upon the margin of the lens, both on its anterior and posterior aspect; it is, however, possible to inflate spaces between them, and this fact led to the description of a space round the margin of the lens under the name of canal of Petit (canal of Hannover). VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE GLOBE OF THE EYE. . The vessels of the globe of the eye are the long, short, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria centralis retince. The long ciliary arteries, two in number, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and pass forwards on each side, between that membrane and the choroid, to the base of the ciliary processes, where each divides into two branches, which form an elaborate net- work in the sul^stance of the ciliary processes and iris. The short ciliary arteries pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic coat, and are distributed to the middle layer of the choroid membrane (chorio- capillaris). The anterior ciliary are branches of the muscular arteries ; they enter the eye just behind the junction of the cornea and sclerotic, and join the anastomotic circle of the iris. It is the congestion of these latter arteries, in iritis, that giv.es rise to the peculiar red zone round the circumference of the cornea. The distribution of the arteria centralis retinae has been already described. The nerves of the eyeball areâ€”the optic, two ciliary nerves from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the ciliary nerves from the oj)hthalmic ganglion. The optic nerve has an outer sheath con- tinuous with the sclerotic and derived from the dura mater, and an inner sheath which it receives from the arachnoid. Between these is the subvaginal space, continuous with the sulxlural space of the â– cranial cavity. OEGAN OF HEARING. The apparatus of hearing is composed of three parts : external ear, middle ear or tympanum, and internal ear or laljyrinth. EXTERNAL EAR. The external ear consists of two portions, the pinna or auricle and meatus ; the former representing a kind of funnel which col- lects the vibrations of the atmosphere producing sounds, and the latter a tube which conveys the vibrations to the tympanum. The PINNA presents a number of folds and hollows on its sur- face, which have difi'erent names assigned to them. Thus, the external folded margin is tlie helix (eXi^, a fold). The elevation parallel with and in front of the helix, is the antihelix {avri, oppo-ORGAN OF VISION. 634 site). The pointed process, projecting like a valve over the openiii<,' of the ear, from the face, is the tragus {epdyos, a goat), prohal.l\ from being sometimes covered with bristly hair like that of a goat ; and a tubercle opposite this is the antitragus. The lower depen- dent and fleshy portion of the pinna is the lobule. The spa-c between the helix and antihelix is named the fossa of the helix (scaphoid or innominate fossa). Another depression at the uppi !â–  extremity of the antihelix, produced by a Ijifurcation of that ridgi-, is the fossa of the antihelix (ovil or triangular fossa); and the laitri- central space, to which all the chan- nels converge, the concha, whi( li oj)ens directly into the meatus. The pinna is composed of integu- ment, fihro - cartilage, ligaments, and muscles. The integument is thin, contains an abundance of sebaceous gland-, and is closely connected with tlie fibro-cartilage. The fibro-cartilage gives form to the pinna, and is folded so as to produce the various convexities and grooves which have been described on its surface. The helix begins in the concha, and partially divides that cavity into two parts ; on it- anterior border, where it commences Fig. 369.â€”K.Meniai ear. h.

The termination of the helix and antihelix forms a lengthened process, the processus caudatus, which is separated from the concha by an extensive fissure. On the anterior surface of the tragus is another fissure, the fissure of the tragus ; and, in the lobule, the fibro-cartilage is wanting. The fibro-cartilage of tlie meatus is divided from the concha by several fissures (fissures of Santorini), and at the upper and anterior part of the cylinder is a considerable space, which is closed by muscular and ligament- ous fibres ; it is firmly attached at its termination to the processus auditorius. The fibro-cartilage of the pinna and meatus is of the yellow variety. The ligaments of the external ear are those which attach llie pinna to the side of the headâ€”viz., anterior, posterior, and ligament of the tragus ; and those of the fibro-cartilage, which serve to pre- serve its folds and connect the opposite margins of the fissures. The latter are two in number, the ligament between the concha and processus caudatus, and the broad ligament wliich extends from the helix, fall. Fossa ( tr. Tragns. at. Autitragus. m.

The major helicis is a narrow band of muscular fibres situated on the anterior border of the helix. It arises from the spine of the heKx, and is inserted into the anterior border of that fold. The minor helicis is placed upon the anterior extremity (crus) of the helix, at its commence- ment in the fossa of the concha. The tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situ- ated on the tragus, and having a vertical direc- tion. The antitragicus arises from the antitra- gus, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the processus caudatus of the helix. The transversus auriculae, partly ten- dinous and partly mus- cular, extends trans- ^versely from the con- vexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the j)inna. The obliquus auris (Tod) is a small band of fibres passing between the upper part of the convexity of the concha and the convexity immediately above it. Dissection.â€”In the recent temporal bone the external auditory meatus may be examined by cutting away with the saw the squamous portion of the bone in front of the fissure of Glaser, and then remov- ing with bone forceps the anterior wall of the meatus, excepting the portion which supports the membrana tympani.

The osseous portion is longer and slightly narrower than the cartilaginous. At its inner end is an oblique groove for tlic membrani tympani; th. groove is defective at the upper part, where there is a small irregulai excavation, the Rivinian recess. The skin of tlu- meatus is very thin, especially towards tlu' bottom of the passage : lining frequently comes away as a complete and very delicate pouch. Some stiff shoi i hairs are also found in its interior, which stretch across the tulu'. and prevent the ingress of insects and dust. In the substance of its lining membrane are a number of ceruminoiis glands, which secrete the wax of the ear. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The pinna is plentifully supplied witli arteries; by the anterior auricular from the temporal, by the poste- rior auricular from the external carotid, and by a branch from the occipital artery. Its nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal of the fifth, the posterior auricular of the facial, and the auricularis magnus of the cervical plexus.

In a fresh specimen in wliicli the meatus has been displayed in the manner above described, it is only necessary to remove with bone forceps the roof of the tympanum, taking care to avoid injuring the membrana tympani, chorda tympani nerve, and chain of small bones. The tympanum is an irregular cavity hollowed out in the base of the petrous bone, and placed between the membrana tympani externally and the labyrinth within. It is narrow below and in front, and wider above and behind, and communicates behind with the mastoid cells, internally with the vestibule and scala tympani, and in front by means of the Eustachian tube with the pharynx.

Facial nerve in aqueduct of Falloplus. 6. Mastoid antrum. 7. Large diploetic mastoid cells. 8. Pyramid, with stapedius muscle escaping from its apex. It is described as having a roof (tegmen tympani) and a floor, the former consisting of a thin plate of bone separating the cavity from the middle fossa of the skull, and the latter being formed by the roof of the jugular fossa. The outer wall corresponds through- out greater part of its extent to the membrana tympani and the ring of bone surrounding it; in front of the latter is the irregular slit called fissure of Glaser, which gives passage to the anterior tympanic artery, and in infancy lodges the long ]3rocess of the malleus (processus gracilis); at the inner extremity of this fissure is a small canal (canal of Huguier) which gives passage to the chorda tympani nerve. The inner wall separates the cavity of the tym- panum from the internal ear ; it is rougli and irregular, and is more extensive than the outer wall. It is marked at its upper part by a638 ORGAN OF HEARING. ndge formed by the aquseductus Fallopii; beneatli this is an oval opening, fenestra ovalis, which lodges the foot of the stapes; next a rounded prominence due to the projection of the first turn of the I cochlea, and called the promontori/; and below this, near the iioor of ! the cavity, a circular opening, fenestra rotunda^ which communicates i with the scala tympani of the cochlea. At the back part of this wall, I behind the fenestra ovalis, is a conical projection named the pyrarfiid; \ it contains the stapedius muscle, the tendon of which escapes through ' a small opening near its summit. The posterior tmll is irregular, and has several small openings which communicate with the mastoid cells. The anterior extremity is narrow, and has opening into it two canals separated by a lamella of bone (processus cochlearif ormis), the lower and larger being the commencement of the Eustachian tube, i and the upper and smaller containing the tensor tympani muscle. I The cavity of the tympanum is lined by mucous membrane con- I tinuous with that of the Eustachian tube and pharynx : it covers I the walls of the cavity including the membrana tympani, is reflected over the ossicles and chorda tympani nerve, and is continued into ' the mastoid cells to form their lining membrane. The epithelium is for the most part columnar and ciliated, but the roof, promon- tory, ossicles, and membrana tympani are covered by flattened â€¢ non-ciliated cells. / The membrana tympani is a thin and semi-transparent mem- ! brane of an oval shape, its long diameter being vertical. It is in- serted into a groove situated around the circumference of the meatus, near its termination, and is placed obliquely across the area of that tube, the direction of the obliquity being downwards and inwards. As seen from the outer surface it presents a depressed centre, or umbo, corresponding to the line of its attachment to the handle of the malleus ; from this depression its fibres radiate, but run in curved â–  lines, so as to cause the membrane to bulge outwards between the | umbo and periphery. At the site of the Rivinian recess the mem- j brane is thin and lax, and is formed by loose connective tissue ; it â–  was specially described by Shrapnell under the name of memhrana , flaccida {ShrapnelVs membrane). \ The membrana tymj)ani is composed of three layers: external, or ' epithelial, continuous with the integument of the meatus ; middle, fibrous, the fibres of which, for the most part, radiate from the | handle of the malleus, but are strengthened at the periphery by a â€¢ strong band of circular fibres ; and internal, mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The tympanum contains three small bones, ossicula auditfisâ€” viz., the malleus, incus, and stapes. The malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle (manu- â–  brium), and two processes, long (processus gracilis), and short (processus brevis). The manubrium is connected with the membrana tympani by its whole length, extending below the central point of tliat mem- brane. The long process descends in the young child to the fissure of Glaser; in the adult it is in great measure converted into639 CAVITY OF THE TYMPANUM. ligamentous tissue ; lience it no longer deserves tlie title of pro- cessus grcacilis, and Helmlioltz proposes to call it processus Fohanus.

The incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resemblance to an anvil. It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer than, and Avidely separated from, the other. It consists of two processes, united nearly at right angles, and at their junction forming a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus.

The stapes is shaped like a stirruji, to which it bears a close resemblance. Its head articulates with the os orl)i- culare, and the two branches (cruia) are connected by their extremities wiih a flat, oval-shaped plate, representiuir the foot of the stirrui^.

The neck of the stapes gives attacli- ment to the stapedius muscle. The ossicula auditus are retained in position and moved ujioii themselves by means of ligaments and muscles. The ligaments are five in number : the suspensory ligament â€¢<! the malleus (Fig. 373, s.l.m.), which is attached by one extremity in the upper wall of the tympanum, and by the other to the head of the malleus ; the anterior ligament of the malleus (formerly descriljed as the laxator ti/mpani muscle), a broad and strong'band which con- nects the anterior wall of the tympanum with the malleus, in a line extending from the base of the processus Folianus to the head ; tlie external ligament of the malleus (Fig. 373, l.c.m.), a fan-shaped band of fibres radiating from the processus brevis to the sides of the Rivinian recess ; the posterior ligament of the incus, a short and thick Itand, which serves to attach the extremity of the short process of that bone to the margin of the 0])ening of the mastoid cells ; and the annuhir ligament, which connects the margin of the foot of the stapes Avitli the circumference of the fenestra ovalis ; it is continuous with tlie periosteum of the vestibular wall and with tliat covering the foot oi the stapes. Between the head of the malleus and the incus, and between the incus and stajies, there are distinct joints ; the bones being uniti'il by ligaments, the osseous surfaces coated with cartilage, and tlie joints lined l)y complete synovial membranes. The muscles of the tympanum are two in numlier, theâ€” 1 Tensor tympani, Stapedius.CAVITY OF THE TYMPANUM. 641 ' The tensor tympani arises from tlie spinous process of the sphenoid, the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the Eus- tachian tube, and passes forwards in a distinct canal, separated from the tube by the processus cochleariformis. It bends nearly at a right angle over the end of that process, and passes, to be inserted into the inner part of the handle of tlie malleus near its base. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. The stapedius arises from the interior of the j)yramid and descending part of the aquseductus Fallopii, it becomes tendinous, and escapes from the summit of the pyramid to be inserted into the neck of the stapes, posteriorly. It is supplied by the tympanic branch of the facial nerve. Actions.â€”The action of the tensor muscle is sufficiently indicated by its name, but that of the stapedius is more difficult to understand. It seems, however, evident that by its contraction it will tend to pull the foot of the stapes out of the fenestra ovalis, and thus prevent â– too forcible excitation of the delicate internal ear. Foramina.â€”The openings in the tympanum are nine in number, five large and foior small; they areâ€” Large Openings. Small Openings. Meatus auditorius, Entrance of chorda tyjnpaui, Fenestra ovalis, Exit of chorda tympani, Fenestra rotunda. For the tensor tym];)ani, Mastoid cells, For the stapedius. Eustachian tube. The opening of the meatus auditorius has been already de- scribed. The fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli) is a reniform opening, situated at the bottom of a small oval fossa in the upper part of the inner ^vtlll of the tympanum, directly opposite the meatus. The long diameter of the fenestra is horizontal, and its convex border directed upwards. It is the opening of communication between the tympanum and vestibule, and is closed by the foot of the stapes and by the lining membrane of both cavities. The fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleas) is somewhat triangular in form, and situated in the inner wall of the tympanum, below and rather posteriorly to the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated by a bony elevation, called the promontory; it lies at the bottom of a funnel-shaped depression, and serves to establish a communica- tion between the tympanum and cochlea. In the fresh subject it is closed by a proper membrane (m. tympani secundaria) as well as by the lining of both cavities. The mastoid cells are the cavities contained in the interior of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. In the majority of casep, the lower and posterior cells are diploetic, contain marrow, and do not communicate witli the cavity of the tym])anuin ; and the upper ones are xmeumat ic, and in communication witli tlie tympanic cavity.642 ORGAN OF HEARING. Sometimes the whole of the cells contain air, while in other speci- mens the mastoid process is sclerosed and there is no general ex- cavation. In all cases, however, a cavity is found at the upper and anterior part of the mastoid which communicates with the tympanic cavity, and is called the mastoid antrum; it is present even in infancy, and corresponds in position to the triangular area bounded above Ijy the superior root of the zygoma, below by the edge of the external auditory meatus, and behind by the commencement of the rough surface of the mastoid. The Eustachian tube is a short canal about an inch and three- quarters in length, extending obliquely between the pharynx and the anterior edge of the tympanic membrane. It is directed do\\-n- wards, forwards, and inwards, and opens anteriorly, behind tlie inferior meatus of the nose, into the pharynx. It consists of an osseous and a fibro-cartilaginous portion, the former of which has been already described in connection with the temporal bone. The cartilage of the Eustachian tube is of a triangular form, having its inferior angles rolled up towards each other, but leaving between them a gap on the under side, which is filled up with fibrous tissue. On its anterior aspect is a muscular band, continuous with the tensor palati, and named by Riidinger dilatator tubce. The tube narrow where it opens into the tympanum, but expands anteriorly, so as to become wide and trumpet-shaped. The smaller openings serve for the transmission of the chorda tympani nerve, and the two muscles of the tympanum. The opening by which the chorda tympani enters the tympanum is at about the middle of its posterior wall, and near the root of the pyramid. The opening of exit for the chorda tymjjani is at the inner end of the fissure of Glaser in the outer wall of the tympanum. The nerve is usually contained in a canal (called the canal of Huguier) distinct from the fissure of Glaser. The opening for the tensor tympani muscle is in the anterior wall, immediately above the oj)ening of the Eustachian tube. The opening for the stapedius muscle is at the apex of a conical bony eminence, the pyramid, which is situated at the back part of the inner wall of the tymj)anum, immediately behind the fenestra ovalis. Directly above the fenestra ovalis is a rounded ridge formed liy projection of the aquoiductxhs Fallopii. Beneath the fenestra ovalis and separating it from the fenestra rotunda is the promontory, a rounded prominence formed by the projection of the first turn of the cochlea. It is channelled on its surface by three small groo%'es which lodge the three tympanic branches of Jacobson's nerve. The foramina and processes of the tympanum may be arranged, according to their situation, into four groups :â€” I.

The veins terminate in the middle meningeal and pharyngeal veins, which form a plexus near the articulation of the lower jaw, and emj)ty into the internal jugular vein. The nerves areâ€”i.

The internal ear is called the labyrinth, from its complexity ; it consists of an osseous cavity and certain membranous structures contained therein, the latter constituting the membranous labv- rinth. The OSSEOUS LABYRINTH presents a series of cavities, which644 ORGAN OF HEARING. are channelled in the substance of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, and is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the ineatus auditorius internus. It is divided into three unequal portions ; these are theâ€” Vestibule, Semicircular canals. Cochlea. The vestibule is the central part of the osseous labyrinth ; it i.s irregularly ovoid in shape, and a little flattened from without in- wards. In front it communicates with the cochlea, and behinil with the semicircular canals ; its outer wall separates it from tlie cavity of the tympanum, and its inner wall corresponds to llie bottom of the meatus auditorius internus. In the outer wall there is seen the reniform opening of the fen- estra ovalis, the margin of which presents a prominent ling towards the vestibule ; it is closed in the recent state by the foot of tlie stapes and its annular ligament, as well as Ijy the lining memljraue of the labyrinth and a special, membrane (membrana secundaria). In the anterior part of the inner wall is a circular dejiression which corresponds to the posterior segment of the cul-de-sac of the internal meatus ; it is called fovea hemispherica, and is pierc i d by a cluster of openings {macula crihrosa) through "which pass fila- ments of the vestibular branch of the auditory nerve, and twigs of the auditory artery. Behind this is a small ridge {crista vcst!- buli), and the commencement of a small canal called the aqim- ductus vestibuli, containing a tubular membranous sheath and a small vein. In the roof is another depression of oval form called/overt hemi- elliptica; it is separated from the fovea liemispherica by a sliglit ridge. Posteriorly, the five openings of the three semicircular canals are observed, the oblique and perpendicular canals joining by one ex- tremity and so entering by a common opening. In front the vestibule opens into the cochlea by means of a wiili', funnel-shaped opening, called a'pertura scala; vestihulce. " The openings of the vestibule may be.arranged, like those of tlie tympanum, into large and small. " The large openings are seven' in number :â€” Fenestra ovalis, Apertura scalsB vestibuli,; u;;ui ij;t^iiji , Eive openings of the semicircular daaials.

Near one extremity of each of the canals is a dilatation of its cavity which is called amjmlla. I. The superior or perpendicular canal is directed transversely across the jjetrons bone, and forms that jjrominence on its anterior I surface which we have already desciibed. It commences by means J of an ampulla in the uj^per j^art of the vestibule, and terminates posteriorly by joining with the oblique canal, and forming a common canal which opens into the back part of the vestibule. â€¢ 2. The posterior or oblique canal corresponds with the posterior part of the petrous bone ; it commences by an ampullary dilatation in the jjosterior part of the vestibule, and curves nearly perpen- dicularly upwards to terminate in the common canal. In the am- pulla of this canal are numerous openings for nervous filaments. 3. The external or horizontal canal is directed outwards towards the base of the petrous bone, and is shorter than the two preceding. It commences by an ampullary dilatation above the fenestra ovalis, and terminates near to the common canal. â–  The COCHLEA (so called from its resemblance to a snail's shell) is the most anterior part of the labyrinth, corresponding by its aj)ex with the anterior wall of the petrous bone, and by its base with the anterior depression at the bottom of the cul-de-sac of the meatus auditorius inter- nus. Its apex is arched so as to form a sort of dome, which is called the cupola. It consists of a gradually tapering canal, about one inch and a half in length, which makes two turns and a half around a cen- tral axis called the modio- Pig. 375.â€”Vertic.il section of the cochlea of a calf lus. The first coil projects showing the modiolus and scalse. into the tympanum, forming that rounded elevation which has already been descrilied as the promontonj. The central axis or modiolus is large near its base, where it corresponds to the first turn of the cochlea, but diminishes as it proceeds towards the apex. Its external surface is composed of dense tissue, but its interior is-spongy, and is pierced by numerous canals, which run spirally in its length, transmitting the filaments of the cochlear nerve. The central canal is usually larger than the others; it transmits the artery of the uaodiolus as well as a nerve, and is called tuhulua ceiitrnlu modioli. The interior of the canal of tlie cochlea is partially divided into two passages oi- scalse l)y means of a thin and porous lamina of bone, the lamina spiralis ossea, which is wound spirally round the modiolus in the direction of the canal. It extends about two-thirdsORGAN OF HEARING. 646 across the diameter of tlie canal, and consists of two thin lamellae, between wliich, and through the perforations on their surfaces, the filaments of the cochlear nerve reach the membranous portion of the cochlea. The upper of the two passages thus separated is called the scala vestibuli, the lower the scala tympani. At the apex of the cochlea the osseous lamina terminates by a liook-shaped process (hamidus lamince spiralis) ; and here also the scalse communicate by means of a small opening called the helico- trema. Inferiorly, one of the two scalae, the scala vestibuli, termi- nates by an oval aperture in the anterior part of the vestibule ; while the other, the scala tymj)ani, becomes somewhat expanded, and opens into the tympanum through the fenestra rotunda. The internal surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by a thin layer of periosteum which is separated from the membranous struc- tures contained in its cavities by a limj)id fluid called the perilymph (liquor Cotunnii). In the cochlea the periosteum invests the two surfaces of the bony lamina spiralis. The fenestra ovalis and fenesti'a rotunda are closed by an extension of this membrane across them, assisted by the membrane of the cavity of the tympanum, and a proper intermediate layer {memhrana secundaria). Besides lining â€¢ the interior of the osseous cavity, the periosteum sends two delicate processes along the aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea, to the dura mater, with which they are continuous. These processes are the remains of a communication originally existing between the dura | mater and the cavity of the labyrinth. * MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH.â€”This consists of certain membra- nous bags contained within the osseous cavity of the vestibule and semicircular canals, and of the structures which serve to complete the I spiral lamina of the f cochlea. The membranous laby- rinth of the semicircular canals and vestibule has the same general shape as the osseous cavity in which it is contained ; it} floats in the perilymph, and is held in position by numerous nerve fila- ments derived chiefly from the vestibular wall, and by fine fibrous bands derived from the periosteum of the osseous labyrinth. It contains in its interior a fluid similar to the perilymph, which is called endolymph, and is secreted bv its lining membrane. Structure.â€”In structure this part of the membranous labynnlli consists of three layersâ€”an outer, fibrous ; a middle, homogeneous (tunica propria); and an inner, epithelial. The fibrous layer consist--^ Fig. 376. â€” Membranous labyrinth, a. Superior semicircular canal. 6. Posterior semicircular canal. c. External semicircular canal. d. Utricle, e. Saccule. /.

The tunica propna is transparent and apparently structureless, and is thinnest where the membranous tube is m con- tact with the osseous wall; it presents towards the cavity of the tube a number of papillary projections covered by the cells of the inner coat. The epithelial layer is formed throughout of a single layer of flattened cells. . p , a ^ The membranous vestibule consists of two sacs, a greater and a lesser. The greater sac, called the utricle (sacculus communis , rests in the depression called fovea hemi-elliptica in the upper and back part of the vestibule ; it is oblong and slightly flattened from within outAvards. Its inner wall is thickened, where it receives numerous Fig. 377.â€”Labyrinth of tlie left ear showing its cavities and the membranous labyrinth: I.

Firmly attached to the wall of the utricle, is a small aggregation of crystals of carbonate of lime ; these are irregular in shape, and are called otoliths (ear-stones), or otoconia (ear-dust). The cavity of the utricle is continuous with that of the membranous semicircular canals, but is distinct from that of the saccule. The lesser sac, called the saccule (sacculus proprius), is spherical in shape, and is situated in the lower and anterior part of the vestibule, lying in the depression of the fovea hemispherica. It648 ORGAN OF HEARING. receives nerves throueh the lamina cribrosa, and contains otolitli- similar to those of the utricle. It is connected by means of a minute passage (canalis reuniens) with a small canal, which is contained within the membranous part of the cochlea, and is called scala media; it also sends a small canal along the aquaeductus vesti- buli, which ends blindly at the surface of the petrous bone. The membranous semicircular canals are about one-third the size of the osseous canals which lodge them ; they o])en into the utricle. They have dilatations which correspond to the ampulhf, but the dilatation of the membranous canals is proportional!\ greater than that of the osseous ones, so that at these places they nearly fill the osseous cavities in which they lie. Here also tlit: wall is much thickened, and on it branches of the vestibular nervu are thickly distributed. In the ampullae the tunica propria is very thick, and causes the wall to project into the cavity in the *.orm of a transverse partition (septum transversum); on this septum the epithelial cells are columnar, and surmounted by fine 10. 378.â€”Section tbrough one of the coils of tlie Cochlea, st, scala tyni- pani; sv, scala vestibuli ; cc, canalis cochleae or scala media ; e, membrane of Beissner; Us to hp, lamin i spiralis membranacea; II , limbus laminae spiralis; s> , sulcus spiralis; gs, gan- glion spirale seated on 51 r, thenerviis cocblearis, indi- cated by the black line ; Iso, lamina spiralis ossea ; t, membrana tectoria; h, niembrana basilaris ; c 0, organ of Corti; l.rp, liga- meiitum spirale ; c c, cells of Claudius, i.

The membranous part of the cochlea* not only comi^letes the lamina spiralis, but also encloses a tube called the canalis membranacea or scala media, within which is a very complicated structure called the organ of Corti. The description of tlie membranous cochlea, therefore, resolves itself into a description of this canal, its boundaries, and the parts contained in it. Scala Media.â€”This canal is triangular in cross section, and i bounded externally by the osseous wall of the labyrinth, lined b its proper membrane. Internally it'is botmded by a thin shee * To understand the description of the membranous cochlea, it is necessary tha the student should constantly refer to Fig. 378.ORGAN OF COETI. 649 called the membrane of Reissner, which separates it from the scala vestibuli. Its floor is formed by a membrane, which is stretched across from the lower edge of the osseous lamina spiralis to the cochlear wall, and is called the membrana basilaris. The scala media accompanies the lamina spiralis throughout, and terminates superiorly in a cul-de-sac near the helicotrema ; below, it also ends in a blind extremity, but from its inner side a small canal (canalis reuniens) passes to join the saccule, as already mentioned. On the upper * surface of the osseous lamina sj)iralis, near to its , outer edge, there is a thick prominence, called limbus lamina spir- alis, which is firmly connected with the periosteum of the lamina. Its surface is irregular, being marked by certain fungiform promi- nences ; these are not all of the same length, the internal ones being short, while the external are long, and hang over towards the basilar memiorane, so as to form a groove beneath them, which is called the sulcus spiralis. Covering in the limbus, and stretching across from its outer edge to the outer wall of the scala, is an elastic membrane called membrana tedoria (membrane of Corti). It is nearly parallel with the basilar membrane, and thus divides the scala media into two parts, the inferior of which is the smallest, and contains the organ of Corti. The basilar membrane is stretched across from the free edge of the osseous lamina to the outer wall of the spiral canal; it is on the same plane as the lamina itself, and is firmly attached at its outer extremity by means of a thick ligament (spiral ligament) to the cochlear wall. The membrane of Reissner arises from the base of the limbus (or on its inner side), and extends across to the upper and outer part of the cochlear wall. It is directed somewhat obliquely, and sepa- rates the scala vestibuli from the scala media. It is composed of very delicate connective tissue, covered on the vestibular side by an epithelioid layer of flattened connective tissue corpuscles, and on the side towards the scala media by simple pavement epithelium. The organ of Corti consists of those structures which are contained between the membrana tectoria above and the basilar membrane below. Its central and most important part is formed of rod-like bodies, which are fixed firmly below to the basilar membrane, but above, their enlarged ends meet together like the beams of a roof, so as to enclose a triangular space. The inner rods overlap the outer, and the latter have a process bent back towards the outer side of the canal. On each side of these central bodies are others which apijear to recline on the larger ones just described ; they consist of an inner and an outer set. The inner cells (inner hair cells) form a single layer, each cell terminating in fine, stiff", hair-like processes. Those on the outer * Fov convenience of description we speaic as if the base of the cochlea was directed downwards and its apex upwards ; it must, however, be kept in mind thnt this is not their position when in situ.

The hairs of the outer series project through ring-like processes which surmount the top of the cells, these processes presenting the appearance of a wire net, and forming what has been named the reticular lamina. On each side of the hair cells the epithelium becomes shorter and shorter, until at length it forms merely a cubical layer, which on the inner side partly fills up the sulcus spiralis, and on the outer side forms a covering for the basilar membrane. VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE INTERNAL EAR. Vessels.â€”The arteries of the labyrinth are derived from the internal auditory branch of the basilar artery, and from the stylo- mastoid branch of the posterior auricular. The auditory artery at the bottom of the meatus internus divides into cochlear and vesti- bular branches, which accompany the branches of the auditory nerve to the vestibule and cochlea. The veins of the vestibule unite with those of the cochlea, and empty themselves into the superior petrosal sinus, or into the com- mencement of the internal jugular vein. Nerves.â€”In order that the student may fully understand the distribution of the nerves of the internal ear, it is necessary, in the first place, that he should know something of the anatomy of the interior of the meatus auditorius internus. The meatus pursues a course directly outwards ; it is about one- third of an inch in length, and terminates in two deej) depressions, separated by a sharp horizontal ridge. The sicperior depression^ the smaller of the two, is divided by a vertical ridge into an anterior portion, forming the commencement of the aqu3edu.ctus Fallopii, and a posterior portion, which corresjjonds with the upper part of the inner wall of the vestibule, and is pierced by numerous small foramina. The inferior depression j)resents posteriorly an oval pit, pierced by numerous foramina, opening into the vestibule ; near its anterior extremity, it is marked by a spiral groove pierced by minute openings for the passage of filaments of the coclilear nerve ; this is called tractus spiralis foraminulenttis. In the centre of the small piece of bone which this groove isolates, is one foramen larger than the rest, Avhich leads into the central canal of the modiolus, tubulus centralis modioli. Upon the posterior wall of the lower depression, and opposite to the spiral groove, is a longitudinal groove leading to a foramen, for the transmission of a considerable branch of the vestibular nerve. The auditory and facial nerves enter the meatus internus together, accompanied by the auditory brancli of the basilar artery. At the bottom of the ineatus the facial enters the aqueduct of' Fallopius, and is conducted along it to the stylo-mastoid foramen, as already described. The auditory nerve divides into two branches at the bottom of652 ORGAN OF TASTE. the meatus, a vestibular nerve aud a cochlear nerve, the latter lying anterior to the foi'nier, and a little below the facial nerve. The vestibular nerve separates into three branches, superior,' middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch gives off a nxmiber of filaments, which pass through the foramina in the ])06- terior part of the si;perior depression ; they enter the vestibule beside the crista vestibuli, and are distributed to the utricle, and the ampulla of the superior and external semicircular canals. The middle vestibular branch sends off numerous filaments which pass through the foramina in the lower depression, enter the vestibule through the fovea hemispherica, and are distributed to the saccule. The inferior and smallest branch passes along the groove and through the foramen at the back part of the meattis; it is distri- buted to the amj)ulla of the posterior canal. The filaments which pass to the canals bifurcate at their extremities, and are applied against the flattened side of each membranous ampulla ; they then pass into the membranous wall, and into the partial septum, which has been already described as projecting into the ampulla {crista acustica). The cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments, which enter the foramina of the tractus spiralis in the base of the cochlea, pass upwards in the canals of the modiolus, and, bending outM^ards at right angles, pass between tlie two layers of the osseous lamina spiralis. Here the nerve filaments form a network, in the midst of which numerous small ganglia have been observed. From this plexus branches are given off externally, which perforate the bottom of-the sulcus spiralis, and, it is supposed, terminate by becoming attached to the rods of Corti, and the cells which adjoin them on each side. The central portion of the cochlear nerve passes through the tubulus centralis modioli, and supplies the apicial portion of the lamina spiralis, and the adjoining structures.' ORGAN OF TASTE. The tongue is composed of muscular fibres, which are distributed in layers arranged in various directions : thus, some are disposed longitudinally (Imgualis snperficialis); others transversely (lingualis transversus) ; others, again, obliquely and vertically. The arrange- ment of the different bundles forming the intrinsic muscles of the tongue has been descril)ed on a previous page (p. 257). Between the muscular fibres is a consideralile quantity of adipose sulv stance, and in the middle of the oi-gan a vertical septum of fibrous tissue. -11 The tongue is connected, i^osteriorly, with the os hyoides by mus- cular attachment; and to the epiglottis by mucous membrane, which forms the three r/losso-epigJottic folds.

A raphe marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The papillae of the tongue are theâ€” Circumvallate papillae, Filiform papillae, Fungiform papilla3. The circumvallate papillae (p. lenticulares) are of large size, and from fifteen to twenty in number. They are situated on the dorsiun of the tongue, near its root, and form a row at each side, which meets its fellow at the middle line, like the two branches of the letter A. Each pajjilla resembles a cone, attached by its apex to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression ; hence they are also named papillae calyciformes. This cup- shajjed cavity forms a kind of fossa around the papilla, Avhence their name circumvallatae. At the meeting of the two rows of these papil- lae upon the middle of the root of the tongue, is a dee}} depression called foramen caecum, into Av^hich several mucous follicles open. The filiform papillae cover the whole surface of the tongue in front of the circumvallate j^apil- lae, but are most abun- dant towards its anterior _ part. They are conical Fig. 381.â€”Filiform papillse of tongue, a. Ai-tery. at their base, and have V. Vein, p, p. Primary papillaj. e, e.

They are ar- ranged in rows, which at the back part of the tongue are nearly parallel with the circumvallate papilla), but get more longitudinal in their direction as we proceed forwards, so that at the tijj of the tongue they get to be nearly parallel ^\-ith the raphe.655 TASTE-BUDS. The fungiform papillae are irregularly dispersed over the dorsum of the tongue, and are easily recognised among the other papillse by their rounded heads, larger size, and red colour. A number of these papillae will generally be observed at the tip of the tongue. All these papillee have minute secondary papillae projecting from their surfaces, and these are coated with a very dense epithelial layer, which is generally flat over the circumvallate and fungiform papillse, but in the others forms hair-like processes, which vary greatly in their size and shape. The circumvallate and fungiform jiapillae appear alone to possess the special sense of taste, the filiform being much too dense at their aj)ices for the apprehension of delicate sensation, and hitherto no nerve filaments have been traced into the secondary papillse which surmount them. The filiform, however, are probably endowed with common sensation, and it is manifest that they perform important service in assisting mastication. Behind the papillse circumvallatse, at the root of the tongue, are a number of mucous glands (Ungual), which open on the surface. There is also a small cluster beneath the tip of the tongue. Taste-buds. â€” These are believed to be the special organs of taste ; they are found on the sides of the circumvallate papillse em- bedded in the sub- stance of the mucous membrane, one end being in contact with the corium, the other opening by minute pores on to the sur- face. They consist of numerous aggregated epithelial cells, the central ones being spindle - shaped, the peripheral ones flat- tened, with tapering ends The free end of each cell is sharp Fio -Taste-buds from the lateral'gustatoiy organ of a rabbi N and pointed, and projects through the pore ; the deep extremity is branched and connected with a plexus of nerve fibres. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The tongue is abundantly supplied with blood by the lingual arteries. The nerves are three in number, and of large size ; tlie gustatory or hncjual branch of the inferior maxillary is distributed to the papillse and mucous membrane generally of the fore-part and sides ot the tongue; it is the nerve of common sensation to those parts With It are distributed filaments of the chorda tvmpani; these seem to go chiefly to the papillae, and experiments tend to show that the sense of taste m the front and sides of the tongue is due to these, and not to tlie lingual filaments, as M-as formerly sup-6s6 ORGAN OF 'J'AS'J'E. I M I I l)Osed. Many observers believe tliat tlie clioi-da tyinpani filaments are really derived from the glosso-pliaryngeal nerve ; that tliey join the. facial nerve at the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascend through the lower i)art of the aqueduct of Fallopius to the iter chorda? poste- rins. Traversing the tympanum in the manner already desci-iljedj and leaving the cavity through the canal of Huguier, the chorda joins the lingual branch of the fifth in the pterygoid region, and with it is distrilnited to the tongue. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve is distributed to the back part of the tongue, and more especially to the circiunvallate papillae ; it endows those parts with the sense of taste. Tlie hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve distributed to the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, and to most of the intrinsic fibres. A branch of the facial nerve, however, is transmitted along the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and in j)art supplies the intrinsic muscles (Hirschfeld). The terminal filaments of the sezisory nerves are supposed in some cases to become attached to the inner ends of the epithelial cells, especially those forming the taste-buds ; the connection bearing a close regiemblance to that observed in the retina, the cochlea, and the nasal mucous membrane. The mucous membrane which invests the tongue is continuous with the derma along the margin of the lips. On either side of the frtenum linguae it may be traced through the sublingual ducts into the sublingual glands, and along Wliarton's ducts into the sub- maxillary glands ; from the sides of the cheeks it passes through the opening of Stenson's ducts to the parotid glands ; in the fauce-s, it forms the assemblage of mucous crypts called tonsils, and may thence be traced downwards into the larynx and pharynx, where it is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth are a number of small glands, M-hich pour their secretion upon the surface. A con- siderable number of these bodies are situated within the lips, in the palate, and in the floor of the mouth. They are named according to their positionâ€”lahial glanyfs, palatal glands, and buccal glands.657 2 T PART VII. SPLANCHNOLOGY. That part of tlie science of anatomy wliicli treats of the viscera is named splanchnology, from the Greek words o-TrXayx^o"; viscns, and Xdvoj. The viscera of the human body are situated in the three great'internal cavities : cranio-spinal, thorax, and abdomen. The viscera of the cranio-spinal cavity, namely, the brain and spinal cord, with the principal organs of sense, have been already described, in conjunction with the nervous system. The viscera of the chest are : "the central organ of circulation, the heart; the organs of respiration, the lungs ; and the thymus gland. The abdominal viscera admit of a subdivision into those which properly belong to that cavityâ€”viz., the alimentary canal, liver, pancreas, spleen, kid- neys, and'^supra-renal capsules ; and those of the pelvis : the bladder and internal organs of generation. THORAX. The thorax is the conical cavity situated at the upper part of the trunk of the body ; it is narrow above and broad below, and is bounded, in fronts by the sternum, six superior costal cartilages, ribs, and intercostal muscles ; laterally, by the ribs and intercostal muscles ; and, behind, by the ribs, intercostal muscles, and vertebral column, as low down as the upper border of the last rib and first lumbar vertebra ; superiorly, by the first rib at each side, the upper part of the sternum in front and the body of the second dorsal vertebra behind ; and, inferiorly, by the diaphragm. The superior opening of the thorax gives passage to the folloAving parts, namely, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and longus colli muscles ; the remains of the thymus gland ; the trachea, CBSophagus, and thoracic duct; left carotid, left subclavian, innominate, superior intercostal, and internal mammary arteries ; the right and left innominate and inferior thyroid veins ; the pneumogastric, cardiac, left recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and sympathetic nerves ; the anterior division of the first dorsal nerve ; and the upper part of the lungs and pleurse. The cavity of the thorax is much deeper on the jDosterior than on the anterior wall, in consequence of the obliquity of the diaphragm, and contains the heart enclosed in its pericardium, with the greatPERICARDIUM. 658 vessels ; tlie lungs, with tlieir serous coverings, the plenrao ; the, o.'soi)hagus ; some iiu])orlaut nerves ; and, in the fa-tus, the thymus gland.

PERICARDIUM. The central organ of circulation, the heart, i.s situated between the two layers of pleura which constitute the mediastinum, and is enclosed in a proper membrane, the pericardium. The pericardium is a tibro-serous membrane, its serous layer being reflected from the serous membrane of the viscus Avhicli it encloses. In shape it is like a truncated cone, the base being down- ward, the truncated apex upward, surrounding the aorta. It con- sists of two layers, external, fibrous; and internal, serons. The fibrous layer is attached above to the great vessels proceeding from the heart^ on which it is continuous with the deep cervical fascia ; and below, to the tendinous ]3ortion of the diaphragm. Where it encloses the great vessels it is jji-olonged on them for some distanceHEART. 659 in a tubular form, and at length becomes lost in their outer coat. The vessels which are partly covered by it are eight in number, namely, the aorta, superior vena cava, four pulmonary veins, and right and left divisions of the pulmonary artery. The serous mem- brane invests the heart with the commencement of its great vessels as high as the arch of the aorta, and is then reflected upon the in- ternal surface of the fibrous layer. The aorta and loulmonary artery are contained in the same tube of pericardium, having been formed by the division of the primitive aorta ; it will consequently be foimd impossible to pass anything between them. Where the serous layer is reflected from the heart on to the bloodvessels, it forms a series of pouches, the largest of which, called the great oblique sinus, is situated between the inferior cava on the right and the left inferior pul- monary vein. Another, but narrower, pouch runs between the aorta and imlmonary artery above, and the sujierior cava and superior pulmonary vein l^elow, and is called the transverse simis. A crescentic fold of pericardium is found lying across the front of the upper left pulmonary vein ; it is called the vestigial fold, and contains the remains of the left sujoerior vena cava. In intimate structure the fibrous layei- is composed of strong interlacing fibres, the serous layer consisting of a thin stratum of elastic tissue disposed in a network, adherent by one surface to the fibrous layer, and smooth on the free surface, where it gives support to a single or double lamina of tesselated endothelium. The bag of the pericardium has few vessels and nerves, the latter being derived from the phrenic and recurrent branch of the right pneumogastric. The pericardium is connected with the sternum by two weak fibrous bands, the superior and inferior sterno-jjericardiac ligaments; it is further steadied and fixed by its connection with the central tendon of the diaphragm below, and the thoracic and deep cervical fasciae above. HEART. The heart is placed obliquely in the chest, the base being directed upwards and backwards towards the right shoulder, and correspond- ing to the mterval between the fifth and eiglitli dorsal vertebrte â€¢ the cqoex forwards and to the left, pointing to the space between the fifth and sixth rib, at about two and a half inches from the sternum. Its posterior or under side is flattened, and rests on the tendinous portion of the diaphragm ; its anterior side is rounded and convex-; the lower or right border is thin {margo acutios) and longer than_ the left border; tlie latter is formed by the left ven- tricle, and IS thick and rounded (marqo obtusus). The heart is divided by a deep transverse groove, auriculo^ventricular ciroovr into an upper or auricular, and a lower or ventricular portion- in the latter, a less distinct and shallower gi'oove, runs from base to apex both on the front and back, interventricular groove, and marks out the right from the left ventricular cavity. In the auriculo-HEART. 66o ventricular and interventricular grooves lie the arteries, veins, neiTe plexuses, and lymjihatics of the organ. The front of the lieart is chiefly formed of the wall of the right ventj-icle ; the left l)order and apex by the left ventricle ; the extreme right edge by the right auricle ; and the posterior surface mainly Ijy the left ventricle, with a small part of the right ventricle and left auricle. At the base, above the auriculo-ventricular groove, are the auricles, surmoimted by their auricular appendages ; these are lappet-like pi'ocesses which overlap the root of the j)ulmonary artery. The lungs extend on to the margins of the heart, especially during inspiration, so that when they are fully inflated only a small triangular part not more than two inches in extent is left uncovered. The pulmonary artery is the large anterior vessel at the root of the heart; it crosses obliquely the commencement of the aorta. The right is the venous side of the heart; it receives into its auricle the venous blood from every part of the body, by the superior and inferior cava and coronary sinus. From the auricle the blood passes into the ventricle, and from the ventricle througli the pulmonary artery to tlie capillaries of the lungs. From these it is returned as arterial blood to the left auricle ; from the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle is carried through the aorta, to be distributed to every part of the body and again returned to the heart by the veins. This constitutes the course of the adult circulation. The heart is best studied in situ. If, however, it be removed from the body, it should be placed in the position indicated by the above description of its situation. An incision should be made from the superior to the inferior cava, and joined by one at right angles to it, passing into the auricular appendage. The blood must then be removed. The RIGHT AURICLE is larger than the left, and consists of a principal cavity and an auricular appendix ; the former is the part into which the great veins empty their blood, and it hence receives the name of sinus venosus or atrium. The interior of the auricle presents for examination five openings, two valves, two relics of fcetal structure, and tAvo peculiarities in the proper structure of the auricle. To facilitate remembrance they may be thus arranged :â€” Valves . ^ Qoj-onary valve. The superior vena cava returns the blood from the upper hal of the body, and opens into the upper and back part of the auricle. The inferior vena cava returns the blood from the lower hal of the body, and opens through the lower and posterior wall, close to the partition between the auricles (septum auricularum). TheRIGHT AURICLE. direction of these two vessels is such, that a stream forced through the superior cava would rush towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. In like manner, a jet issuing from the inferior cava would dash its stream against the septum auriculariim ; this is the proper direction of the two currents during fcetal life. The coronary sinus returns the venous blood from the substance of the heart; it opens into the auricle between the inferior cava and auriculo-ventricular opening, under cover of the coronary valve. The foramina Thebesii are minute pore-like openings of small veins which issue directly from the muscular structure of the heart, Fig. 384.â€”Anatomy of the heart. : I. Right auricle. 2.

Similar openings are also found in the left auricle, and in the right and left ventricles, but, in the latter, they are commonly not the termination of vessels but mere csecal depressions. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large opening of com- municatu)n l)etween the auricle and ventricle. It is oval in form, and admits tliree fingers easily.

The annulis ovalis is .situated on the septum auricularum, oppo- site the termination of the inferior cava. In the fcotus it formed the margin of an oval opening (foramen ovale) by which the two auricles communicated. In tlie adult the annulus is commonly incomplete below. The fossa ovalis is an oval depression corresponding with the foramen ovale of the fd'tus. This opening is closed at birth by a thin valvular layer, which is continuous with the left margin of the annulus, and is frequently imperfect at its upper pai-t. The depres- sion or fossa in the right auricle results from this arrangement. There is no fossa ovalis in the left auricle. Fio. 385.â€”Anatomy of the heart: right side. i.

The tubercle of Lower is tlie portion of auricle intervening between the openings of the superior and inferior cava. Being thicker than the walls of the veins, it forms a projection, which was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava into the auriculo-ventricular opening. It is better marked in the lower animals than in man. The musculi pectinati are small muscular columns situated in the auricular appendix. They are numerous, and arranged parallel with each other ; hence their cognomen pectinati, like the teeth of a comb. They terminate posteriorly on a vertical ridge, the crista terminalis of His. The RIGHT or ANTERIOR VENTRICLE is triangular in form. Its walls form the chief part of the anterior surface and lower border of the heart, and a small portion of the posterior surface. The pos- terior side, which is also inferior, is flat, and rests on the diaphragm ; the inner side corresponds with the partition between the two ventricles, septum ventriculorum; the anterior side is convex. Superiorly where the pulmonary artery arises, there is a dilatation of the ventricle, termed the infundibulum, or conus arteriosus. The ventricular septum bulges towards the right, so that in cross sections of the heart, the cavity of the right ventricle is crescentic. Dissection.â€”The right ventricle is to be laid open by grasj)ing the wall with the left hand, transfixing it with the scalpel about ,half-way down, and carrying the incision onwards to the apex of the heart. It contains, to be examined, two openings, the auriculo-ventricular and that of the pulmonary artery ; two apparatus of valves, tricuspid and semilunar ; and a muscular and tendinous apparatus belonging to the tricuspid valves. They may be thus arranged :â€” Auriculo-ventricular opening. Tricuspid valve, Opening of the pulmonary artery. Semilunar valves. Chordae tendinete, Columnce carnese. The auriculo-ventricular opening is surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered by tlie lining membrane (endocardium) of the heart. It is the opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle. The opening of the pulmonary artery is situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum, on the left side of the right ventricle, and upon the anterior aspect of the heart. The tricuspid valve is formed by three triangular folds of the lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.' They are connected by their base around the auriculo-ventricular opening; and by their sides and apices Avhich are thickened, they give attachment to a number of slender tendinous cords, called chorda) tendinea). The chordae tendinese are the tendons of the thick muscular columns (cohmim carnece) wliich stand out from tlieHEART. 664 walls of the ventricle and serve as muscles to the valves. A num- ber of these tendinous cords converge to a single muscular attach- ment. Of the three segments of which the valve is composed one is placed anteriorly, and is connected with the anterior wall, a second is placed against the posterior wall, while the third lies between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of the pulmo- nary artery ; the first of , these (anterior) is attached by means of chordae tendinese to a papillary muscle springing from the anterioi' free wall of the cavity, the second (left or infundibular) is attached in like manner to a papillary muscle on the posterior Avail, while the third is connected directly by its chordae to the ventricular septum {posterior or septal). Between the bases of these three flaps small intermediate folds are usually found. The chordae tendineae are at- tached not only to the margins of the valve segments, but also to the base and outer or ventricular surface ; there are none, however, at- tached to the inner surface, over which the blood passes in its course from the auricle to the ven- tricle, so that this surface is smooth throughout, and fric- tion is thus lessened. The tricuspid valves prevent the regurgi- tation of blood into the auricle during the contraction of the ventricle, and they are prevented from being them- selves driven back by the chordae ten- dineae and their mus- cular attachments. The columnae car- neae (fleshy columns) is a name exi:)ressive of the appearance of the internal walls of the ventricles, which, with the exception of the infundibulum, seem formed of muscula Fio. 386.â€”Portion of the wall of the ventricle d, d', :md aoita, Â«,6.c, showing attachments of one flap of the mitral and the aortic valves, /tandg-.

They are divided, according to the manner of their connection, into three sets. i. The great number are attached by the whole of one side, and merely form convexities into the cavity of the ventricle. 2. Others are connected by both extremities, being free in the middle. 3. Two of larger size called musculi papillares, are attached by one ex- tremity to the walls of the heart, and by the other give insertion to the 'chordte tendinese. One of these is connected with the anterior and the other with the posterior wall of the ventricle. At the base of the anterior one a transverse fleshy band stretches across to the ventricular septum ; it is called the moderator band, and is believed to strengthen the thin anterior wall by binding it to the firmer septum. The semilunar or sigmoid valves, three in number, are situated around the commencement of the pulmonary artery, being formed by a folding of its lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are attached by their convex borders, and free by the concave, which are directed upwards in the course of the vessel, so that, during the current of the blood along the artery, [i they are pressed against the sides of the cylinder ; but if regurgita- tion ensue, they are immediately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tu.be. The margins of the valves are thicker than the rest of their extent, and each valve presents in the centre of this margin a small fibrous thickening, called corpus Arantii, which locks in with the other two during the closure of the valves, and ) secures the triangular space which would otherwise be left by the I approximation of three semilunar folds. On each side of the nodule, the edge of the valve is folded and thin, and to this j^art the term lumda has been applied. When the valves are closed, the lunulse are brought in contact with each other by their surfaces. i Between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are three pouches called the pulmonary sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva), Similar sinuses are situated behind the valves at the commencement of the aorta, and are larger and more capacious than those of tlie pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery commences by a scalloped border, corre- sponding with the three valves which are attached along its edge. It is connected to the ventricle by muscular fibres, and by the lining membrane of the heart. The LEFT or POSTERIOR AURICLE is thicker than the right, and situated more posteriorly. The auricular appendix is constricted at its junction with the auricle, and has a foliated appearance : it is directed forwards towards the root of the pulmonary artery, to which the auriculce of both sides appear to converge. Dissection.â€”The left auricle is to be laid open by one incision, running vertically downwards in front of the pulmonary veins, and a second at right angles to this, into the auricular appendix. It presents for examination five o])enings, and the muscular structure of the appendix : the fossa ovalis, as previously observed, is not to666 HEART.

LEFT VENTRICLE.â€”The' left ventricle is to be opened in the same manner as the right by transfixing its anterior wall close to the septum, and cutting downwards to the apex. The left ventricle is conical in external figure ; it forms tlie ajiex of the heart, by projecting beyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the advanl"age in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven lines in thickness, those of the right ventricle l)en)g about two lines and a half.

The auriculo-ventricular opening is a dense fibrous ring covered T)y the endocardium, but smaller in size than that of the right side: Its fibrous structure is closely connected with that of the right auri- culo-ventricular and aortic rings ; at the junction of the three there is a fibro-cartilaginous mass, and in some animals (as the ox) a partial ring of bone called os cordis. The mitral valve is attached around the auriculo-ventricular opening, as is the tricusj)id in the right ventricle. It is thicker than the tricuspid, and consists of two segments, of which the anterior is the largest and is placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of tlie aorta. The posterior is placed behind and to the left of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The difi'erence in size of the two valves, both being triangular, and the space between them, has given rise to the idea of a bishop's mitre after which they are named. Two small secondary flaps are placed between the two larger ones. These valves, like the tricuspid, are fur- nished with an ap- paratus of tendinous chords, chordce ien- dinece, which are at- tached to two very large musculi pa2:)ii- lares. Tliecolumnaecar- nese are smaller than those of the right ven- tricle, but are more numerous and more closely reticulated ; they admit of the same arrangement into three kinds as on the right side.

The semilunar valves are placed around the conmiencement of the aorta, like those of tlie pulmonary artery ; they are similar in structure, and are attached to the scalloped border by which the aorta is connected with the ventricle. The nodule in the centre of each fold is larger than those of the pulmonary valves, and it was these that Aranzi particularly described ; but the term corpora Arantii is now applied indiscriminately to both. The fossse be- tween the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are larger than those of the pulmonary artery, and are called the sinus aortici (sinuses of Valsalva). The part of the ventricle which leads upwards to the aorta is sometimes described as the aortic vestibule or conus arteriosus; its surface is smooth from the absence of columnae carneae, and from its walls containing a large amount of fibrous tissue it does not collapse when the heart empties. The interventricular septum is of about the same thickness as the wall of the left ventricle; it is thickest below and gradually thins as it ascends. At its iipper and anterior part there is a small area where the muscular fibres are entirely absent, and the septal wall consists only of fibrous tissue between two layers of endocardium ; this is called the undefended space or membranous2)art of th e septum. It is situated between the aortic and left ai;riculo-ventricular openings. Position of the Heart in Relation to the Chest Wall. Two-thirds of the heart lie to the left of the middle line, only the right auricle lying to the right of it; its extreme limit to the right is about one inch from the border of the sternum, and to the left two and a half inches from the edge of that bone. The upper margin of the auricles corresponds to a line drawn from the second right to the first left intercostal space. The right auricle lies behind the lower part of the sternum, its outer edge being situate at about an inch to the outer side of the right border of the bone. The left auricle lies on the left of the sternum, in a line running from the second left inter- costal space to the upper border of the fourth left cartilage. The right ventricle extends from the third to the sixth cartilage of the left side near the sternum, the part nearest the surface being the conus arteriosus. The left border, formed by the left ventricle, may be defined by a line curved to the left, and extending from the edge of the sternum in the third left intercostal space, to the fifth space at about three and a half inches from the middle line The apex of the heart, also formed by the left ventricle, is situated behind the fifth intercostal space, about two inches below the nipple, and half an inch to its inner side. The right auricido-ventricular opening (tricuspid valve) corresponds to the iniddle of the sternum, on a line Avith the fourth costal cartilages. Tlie left auriculo-ventricular Oldening (mitral valve) lies behind the third intercostal sj^ace of the669 KELATION OF HEART TO CHEST WALL. left side at about an inch from the sternum. The pulmonary opening (pulmonary semilunar valves) is placed to the left of the sternum, on a level with the articulation of the third cartilage. The aortic open- ing (aortic semilunar valves) is placed lower than the pulmonary, and corresj)onds to the upper edge of the third intercostal space close to the sternum. The valves are so situated that the mouth of a stethoscope jDlaced over the inner end of the third intercostal space of the left Fifi. 389.-Po.-iitiL.u of the heart in relation to the chest wall, v, i.

A needle introduced into the second right intei'costal space close to the sternum, will pierce first the pleura and lung, then the pericardium, and next the ascending aorta ; introduced into the third, fourth, or fifth space of the right side, it will, after piercing the pleura and lung, enter the right auricle of the heart.670 HEART. STRirCTURE OF TH13 HEART. * Tlie heart is covered externally by a delicate serous nieniln-ane, tlie pericardium, and is lined within by another serous membrane, the endocardium; its walls consist for the most part of muscular fibres, forming the myocardium, with a considerable amount of fat, especially in the grooves on tlie surface, and beneath the pericardium. The large openings are surrounded by rings of fibrous tissue, and these are intimately connected with a fibro-cartilaginous mass situ- ated in the angle between the aortic and two auriculo-ventricular openings. Muscular Structure. j The muscular fibres of the heai't have been already described in the section on Histology (p. 31) ; but their arrangement in the auri-| cular and ventricular walls has still to be studied. " I Ventricles.â€”The fibres of the ventricles have a very intricate arrangement. They may be divided into seven layers, the fibres of which differ in direction. The fibres of the first layer run spirally downwards from left to right, but nearly verticallj-; those of the second laj^er take the same general direction, but are more inclined to the horizontal; those of the third layer are still more transvei'se, and the fourth layer is quite transverse. Passing the fourth layer, which occupies a central position in the ventricular Avails and form.'^ the boundary between the external and internal layers, the order of arrangement is reversed and the fibres of the remaining layers, viz., five, six, and seven, gradually return in an opposite direction and in an inverse order to the same relation to the vertical as that maintained by the first external layer. The fibres composing corre- sponding external and internal layers, such as layers one and seven, two and six, &c., are continuous in the left ventricle at the apex, and in the right ventricle in the track for the anterior coronary artery, the fibres of both ventricles being for the most part continuous like- wise at the base. The fibres of the right and left ventricles anteriorly and septally are to a certain extent independent of each other; whereas posteriorly many of them are common to both ventricles; i.e., the fibres pass from one ventricle to the other. At the apex the fibres are twisted round like a scroll or whorl, and then the external fibres enter into the interior of the ventricle, and some of them are continuous with tho?e of the musculi papillares, others with the innermost layer of spiral fil;)res. The fibres from the back and front of the ventricle enter the apex in two difterent bundles, so that the whorl is composed of a double set of fibres twisted round each other something like the fingers of the two hands when they are folded over each other and closed. â€¢ Auricles.â€”The muscular fibres of the auricles are disposed in three sets transverse, spiral, and circular. The transverse are most ex- ternal ; they extend over both cavities and enter the septum. _ The spiral are attached at each extremity to the auriailo-ventricularMINUTE STRUCTURE. -671 rings ; tliey are looped and irregular in tlieir arrangement, and are common to both auricles. The circular begin at the apex of the appendix and are continued on to the body of the auricle ; they have on their interior a number of fibres which are arranged longi- tudinally. The circular fibres belonging to each auricle are distinct from those of its fellow. Other fibres surround the entrance of the venoe cavfB and pulmonary veins and are continued for some distance along these vessels. Minute Structure. The cardiac pericardium (epicardium), is a thin layer, composed of sub-serous areolar tissue formed by a network of fine elastic fibres, adherent by the deep surface to the muscular structure of the heart; this sup- ports on its free surface a single layer of polygonal endothelial cells, in the midst of Avliich stomata are found, communicating with the sub-pericardial lymphatics. Beneath the pericardium, especially in the grooves of the heart, is more or less adipose tissue, which is sometimes distributed more ex- tensively over the surface of the organ. The endocardium, or lining membrane of the heart, is also thin, hixt thicker in the auricles than in the ventricles, and especially in the left auricle. It consists of three layersâ€”namely, (i) a thin stratum of white fibrous areolar tissue, which connects it to the muscular striicture ; (2) a middle layer, composed of elastic tissue, which is so abundant in tlie auricles as to constitute a fig. 390.â€”Endothc- fenestrated membrane ; and (3) a layer of poly- Unm of the endo- gonal endothelial cells. Muscular fibres similar carduim. to those of the wall of the heart are also found in certain parts. In the ventricles the endocardium is transparent; in the auricles, particularly the left, it is opaque and white ; it is continuous with the lining membrane of the vessels which open into the heart. Beneath the endocardium of the ventricles in some animals, as the horse and sheep, peculiar beaded,-reticulating fibres are found, and have been named the fibres of Purldnje. Tliey are formed of large clear nucleated cells joined end to end, surrounded by gi-anular material; the outer part of the cells shows evidences of transverse .striation. 'I'hey are believed to represent a stage in the develop- ment of the heart muscle, and are not present in the adult human heart. The auriculo-ventricular valves are composed of two layers of endocardium, connected in the l)ody of the valve by areolo-tibrous tissue, mingled with a network of elastic fibres ; towards the edges of tlie valve, the two layers become blended with each other, and form a single membrane. Occasionallv the muscular fibres of the heart wall are continued into these valves. The chords tendineceHEART. 672 consist of a fasciculus of tendinous fibres invested by a thin layer of endocardium. The semilunar valves are composed of a thin stratum of elastic and areolar tissue, the elastic tissue forming a fine network in tlie substance of the latter, and the free surface being invested by a single or double layer of endothelium. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the heart are derived from the left and right coronary ; the capillaries form a fine netwoi-k around the muscular fasciculi as in other muscles ; the veins accom- pany the arteries, and empty themselves by the common coronary vein into the right auricle ; the Thebesian and right cardiac veins discharging their blood directly into the auricle. The valves of the heart are non-vascular, with the exception of the auriculo-ventri- cular valves when they contain muscular fibre. Lymphatic vessels are scanty in the bag of the ])ericardium, but numerous beneath the visceral layer ; they follow the grooves of the heart, and terminate in the glands situated beneath the arch of the aorta, and upon the bifurcation of the trachea. The nerves of the heart are numerous, and derived from the cardiac j^lexuses, which are formed by filaments fi'om the sym- ]iathetic and pneumogastric nerve, and reach the substance of the organ by means of the anterior and posterior coronary plexus. The nervous filaments partly accompany the vessels, partly cross theij- course, anastomose with each other at acute angles, and pierce the surface of the heart to reach its substance and the endocardium. The nerves are grey, being composed of fine pale fibres, a few only of the larger nerves containing in addition an admixture of medullated fibres. Wliere the nerve filaments intersect each other there are minute ganglionic enlargements, which receiA^e the name of ganglia of Remak. Size and Weight of the Heart.â€”Roughly stated, the heart is about equal in size to the closed fist of the individual; it measures about five inches in length, three and a half in greatest width, and two and a half in greatest thickness. The average weight of the heart in the male is eleven ounces, and in the female about nine ounces. M Foetal Heart and Foetal Circulation. ^ Foetal Heart.â€”At the time of birth the heart is large in pro- portion to the size of the body ; the walls of the two ventricles are of nearly equal thickness, and are relatively thicker than in adult life ; the right and left auricles communicate by an oval opening, foramen ovale (Foramen of Botal). Both ventricles ]iour their blood into the aorta, this being accomplished in the case of the right ventricle by means of a trunk connecting the pulmonary artery with the junction of the transverse and descending parts of the arch, ductus arteriosus ; the Eustachian valve is large, and serves to prevent the blood from the inferior cava passing into the auricnlo- ventricular opening, directing it into the foramen ovale. Foetal Circulation.â€”The pure blood is brought from the placentaFCETAL CIRCULATION. 673 by the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein passes through the umbilicus and enters the liver, where it divides into several branches ; two or three of these branches are distri- buted to the left lobe, one branch communi- cates with the portal vein in the transverse fissure and supplies the right lobe, and a large branch, the duc- tus venosus, passes directly backwards and joins the inferior vena cava. In the inferior cava the j)ure blood becomes mixed with that which is returning from the lower extre- mities and abdominal ^dscera, and is carried through the right auricle (guided by the Eustachian valve) and through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed by means of the carotid and sub- clavian arteries, princi- pally to the head and upper extremities. From the head and upper extremities the impure l)lood is re- turned by the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle it is propelled into the right ventricle, and from the right ventricle into the pul- monary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be circulated through the lungs and oxygenated, but in the fcctus the lungs are solid and almost impervious. Only a small quantity of blood passes therefore into tlie lungs, the greater part courses through the ductus arteriosus into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mingled with a very small portion of the pure blood derived from the left ventricle. 2 u â€¢ Fig. 391.â€”Fcetal circulation, a.

The arrows show the course of the blood current.674 FCETAI, CIRCULATION. Passing along the aorta, a small quantity of this mixed blood is distributed by the external iliac arteries to the lower extremities; the greater portion is conveyed by the hypogastric branches of the internal iliac arteries to the placenta ; the hypogastric arteries pass forwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder, and upwards along the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, where they become the umbilical arteries. From a careful consideration of this circulation, we perceiveâ€”ist. That the pure blood from the placenta is distributed in considerable quantity to the liver, before entering the general circulation. Hence arises the abundant nutrition of that organ, and its enormous size in comparison with other viscera. 2dly. That the right auricle is the scene of meeting of a double cui-rent; the one coming from the inferior cava, the other from the superior, and that they must cross each other in their resjiective courses. The inferior cava opens almost directly into the left auricle ; and, by the aid of the Eustachian valve, the current in the cava is almost entirely excluded from the right auricle. 3dly. That the blood which circulates through the arch of the aorta comes directly from the placenta; and although mixed with the impure blood of the inferior cava, yet is propelled in such abundance to tlie head and upper extremities, as to provide for the increased nutrition of those parts, and prepare them, by their greater size and development, for the functions which they are required to perform at the instant of birth. 4thly. That the blood circulating in the descending aorta is very impure, being obtained principally from the returning current in the superior cava; a small quantity only being derived from the left ventricle. Yet it is from this impure blood that the nutrition of the lower extremities is provided ; hence we are not surprised at their insignificant develojjment at birth. 5thly. That there are three places where a certain admixture of impure with purer blood occurs, viz., (i) at the junction of the ductus venosus and inferior cava, (2) in the right auricle, and (3) at the junction of the ductus arteriosus and aorta ; the first of these is tlae only important mixture. After birth, the foramen ovale becomes gradually closed by a inembranous layer, which is developed from the margin of the opening on the left side and from below upwards, and completely separates the two auricles. The situation of the foramen is seen in the adult heart, on the septum auricularum, and is called the fossa ovalis; the prominent margin of this opening is tlie annnlus ovalis. As soon as the lungs have become inflated by the first act of inspiration, the blood of the pulmonary artery courses through its right and left branches into the lungs, to be returned to the left auricle by the ])ulmonary veins. Thus the pidmonary circulation is established. Then tlie ductus arteriosus contracts and degenerates into an impervious fibrous cord, serving in after-life simply as aLAEYNX. 675 bond of union between the left jDulmonary artery and the concavity of the arch of the aorta. The current through the umbilical cord being arrested, the hypo- gastric arteries likewise contract and become impervious. The umbilical vein and ductus venosus, also deprived of their circulating current, become reduced to fibrous cords, the former being the round ligament of the liver, and the lattei' a fibrous band which may be traced along the fissure of the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava. OEGANS OF EESPIEATION AND VOICE. The organs of respiration are the two lungs, with their air-tube, the trachea, to the ajjper part of which is adapted an apj)aratus of cartilages, constituting the organ of voice, or larynx. THE LARYNX. The larynx is situated at the fore-part of the neck, between the trachea and base of the tongue. It is a short tube, of an hour-glass form, and is composed of cartilages, ligaments, muscles, vessels, nerves, and mucous membrane. , The cartilages are nine in number, three of which are single and placed in the middle line ; the other six are arranged in three j)airs jilaced symmetrically on each side. They are theâ€” 'J'hyroid, Two cornicula laryngis. Cricoid, Two cuneiform. Two arytenoid, Epiglottis. The thyroid {6vpe6s JSos, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx : it consists of two lateral portions, or alae, Avhich meet at an angle in front, and form the projection which is known by the name of pomum Adami. In the male, after puberty, the angle of union of tlie two alse is acute ; in the female, and before puberty in the male, it is obtuse. When the pomum Adami is j)rominent a bursa mucosa is often found between it and the skin. ' Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and forms a rounded border posteriorly, which terminates above, in the superior cornu, and l)elow, in the inferior cornu ; the former pass upwards and slightly backwards, and are connected by means of the thyro-hyoid ligaments with tlie extremities of the greater cornua of the os hyoides; the latter curve downwards and inwards, and terminate by a sniooth facet, by means of which they articulate with the lateral aspect of the cricoid cartilage. On the side of the ala is an oblique line or ridge, directed downwards and forwards, and bounded at each 'ex- tremity by a tubercle. Into this line tlie sterno-tliyroid muscle is inserted, and from it the thyro-hyoid takes origin ; the triangular area behind it gives attachment to the inferior constrictor of theLARYNX. 676 Fig. 392.â€”Cartilages of the larynx.

Ill the receding angle, foi'med by the meeting of the two alse, oil the inner side of the cartilage, and near its lower Ijorder, are attached the epiglottis, vocal cords, tliyro - arytenoid and thyro - epiglot- tidean mnscles. By its upper border the thyroid cartilage is connected witli the hyoid bone hy means of the thyro- hyoid membrane, its lower border being in like manner connected with the cricoid cartilage by the crico-thyroid membrane. The posterior border of each ala has attached to it the thyro- hyoid and palato-pliaryngeus muscles. The cricoid (KpUos â‚¬i8os, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, narrow in front, and broad behind, where it is sur- mounted by hvo rounded surfaces, which articulate with tlie arytenoid cartilages. At the middle line, posteriorly, is a vertical ridge giving attachment to the oesophagus, and at each side of the ridge are tlie depressions which lodge tlie crico-arytenoidei postici muscles. On either side of the ring is a glenoid cavity, which articulates with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. Its upper border gives attachment to the lateral crico-arytenoideus muscle and the crico- thyroid membrane, and its lower border is connected with the upper ring of the trachea by fibrous membrane. The arytenoid cartilages (dpvraiva,* a pitcher), two in number, are triangular and prism oul in form. They are broad and thick below where they articulate with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; pointed above, and prolonged by two small pyriform fibro-carti- lages, cornicula laryngis (capitula Saiitorini), whicli are curved inwards and back- wards, and they each present three surfaces, posterior, iii- The posterior surface is concave, and lodges part of the aryteiioideus muscle ; the internal surface is smooth, and forms part of the lateral wall of the glottis ; the anterior or external surface is I'ougli and uneven, and gives attachment to the vocal cord, tliyro-aryteiioideus, crico-arytenoideus lateralis * This derivation has i-eference to the appearance of both cartilages taken together and covered by mucous membrane. In animols, which were the principal sub- jects of dissection among the ancients, the opening of the larynx, with the ary- tenoid cartilages, bears a curious resemblance to the mouth of a pitcher with a Lii^ge spout.

The outer angle is a stout prominent process, which gives attachment to the crico-arytenoideus posticus and crico-arytenoideus lateralis muscles, and hence has been named the processus muscularis; the anterior angle is a sliarp and pointed process directed forwards ; it gives attachment to the inferior thyro- arytenoid ligament or true vocal cord, and has been named the â– processus vocalis. The cuneiform cartilages (cartilages of Wrisberg) are two small cylinders of yellow fibro-cartilage, about seven lines in length, and enlarged at each extremity. They lie in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane. In the male, the cartilages of the larynx are more or less ossified, particularly in old age. The epiglottis (eViyXturTty, u]3on the tongue) is a fibro-cartilage of a yellowish colour, studded with a number of small mucous glands, lodged in shallow pits on its surface. It is shaped like an obcor- date leaf, and placed immediately in front of the opening of the larynx, which it partly closes when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue. It is attached by its point to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage by means of fibrous tissue forming the thyro-epiglottic ligament, and to the inner surface of the body of the hyoid bone by the kyo-epiglottic ligament; with the base of the tongue it is connected by folds of mucous membrane forming the frenula. or glosso-epiglottidean folds, and with the summit of the arytenoid cai- tilages by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. Its laryngeal surface is concavo-convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side ; the convex portion projects into the anterior part of tlie upj^er opening of the larynx, and forms the cushion of the epiglottis. Ligaments.â€”-The ligaments of the larynx are numerous, and may be arranged into four groups : i. Those which articulate the thyroicl with the OS liyoides. 2. Those which connect it with the cricoid. 3. Ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages. 4. Ligaments of the epi- glottis. 1. The ligaments which connect the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number. Two thyro-hyoid ligaments pass between the superior cornua of the thyroid and the extremities of the greater cornua of the os hyoides ; they are composed of yellow fibrous tissue, and often con- tain a sesamoid bone or cartilage (cartilage triticea). The thyro-hyoid membrane is a broad membranous layer, occu- pying tlie entire space between the upper bordei' of the thyroid cartilage and the upper and inner border of the os hyoides. It is pierced by the superior lai-yngeal nerve and artery. 2. The ligaments connecting the thyroid to the cricoid cartilage are also three in number :â€” Two capsular ligaments, with their synovial membranes, whicli form the articulation between the inferior cornua of the thyroid and the sides of the cricoid ; and the crico-thyroid membrane. The crico-thyroid membrane is a fan-shaped layer of yellow678 LARYNX. fh1nm...^f 'i ^'".^'^ ^'""'^'"^ ci^ico-thyroid ligament) and thinner at eacli side (lateral crico-tl.yroid ligament). It i.s attached by it&apex to the lower border and receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and by its ex])anded margin to the upper border of the cricoid and base ol the arytenoid cartilages. Superiorly it is con- tinuous with the inferior margin of the vocal cords. The front of tne crico-tiiyroid membrane is crossed by a small artery, the inferior laryngeal, and is the spot selected for the operation of laryngotomv. Laterally it is covered in by the crico-thyroid and lateral crico- arytenoid muscles. number^^ l^g^i^^^^ts of the arytenoid cartilages are eight in Two capsular ligaments, with synovial membranes, which arti- culate the arytenoid cartilages with the cricoid, strengthened behind Fig. 394.â€”Vertical section of the larynx, showing its ligaments, i.

The superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments are two scattered bands of fibres attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to a tubercle on, the anterior surface of each arytenoid cartilage, and contained in the folds of mucous membrane constituting the false vocal cords. The lower border of this liga- ment forms the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or true vocal cords, are thicker than the superior, and are comi)osed of yellow elastic tissue. Each ligament is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior angle of the base of679 MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. the arytenoid. The inferior border of the vocal cord is continuous with the lateral exiDansion of the crico-thyroid ligament. The superior border forms the lower boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The space between the two true vocal cords is the glottis or rima glottidis. 4. The ligaments of the epiglottis are five in numberâ€”namely, three glosso-epiglottic, hyo-epiglottic, and thyro-epiglottic. The glosso-epiglottic ligaments are three folds of mucous mem- brane, which connect the anterior surface of the epiglottis with the root of the tongue. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the anterior aspect of the epiglottis near its apex, and the upper margin of the body of the os hyoides. The thyro - epiglottic ligament is a long and slender fasciculus of yellow elastic tissue, which embraces the apex of the epiglottis, and is inserted into the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately below the anterior fissure and above the attachment of the vocal cords. Muscles.â€”The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are nine in num- ber ; five of which are the muscles of the vocal cords and riina glottidis, and four are muscles of the epiglottis. The five muscles of the vocal cords and rima glottidis areâ€” Grico-thyroid, Thyro-arytenoideus, Crico-arytenoideus posticus, Arytenoideus. Grico-arytenoideus lateralis, The crico-thyroid. muscle arises from the anterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes obliquely outwards and backwai'ds to be inserted into the lower and inner border of the ala of the thyroid from its tubercle as far bade as the inferior cornu. Some of its fibres are continuous with those of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx, and others with those of the crico-arytenoideus lateralis. The crico-arytenoideus posticus arises from the depression on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes upwards and outwards to be inserted into the muscular angle of the arytenoid. Its upper fibres are continuous with the lower fibres of the ary- tenoideus. The crico-arytenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the nuiscular angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The thyro-arytenoideus is situated above the preceding muscle ; it arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, close to the outer side of the true vocal cord, and passes backwards parallel with the cord, to be inserted into the base and outer and anterior surfaces of the arytenoid cartilage. Some observers describe the fibres of this muscle as being attached to the true vocal cord, spreading along its outer border ; this, however, is nuich disputed, and must be re- garded at present as not definitely proved. The arytenoideus muscle occupies the posterior concave sur- face of the arytenoid cartilages, between which it is stretched; ItLAKYNX. 68o consists of deep fibres arranged transversely, and passing between the arytenoid cai'tilages, and of two oblique bands crossing each other and continuous by their outer ends with the thyro - arytenoideus. The uppermost fibres run to the carti- lages of Santorini, and the lower ones blend with those of the thyro- arytenoideus, and crico - arytenoideus lateralis (Kanthack). The four muscles of the epiglottis are â€” Thyro-epiglottideus, Aryteno-eiDiglottideus superior, Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior, Hyo-epiglottideus. The thjo-o-epiglottideus appears to be formed by the upper fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus muscle ; they spread out on the external surface of the sac- culus laryngis, and in the aryteno-epi- glottidean fold of mucous membrane, on which they are lost; a few of the anterior fibres being continued onwards to the side of the ejiiglottis (depressor eiDiglottidis). The aryteno-epiglottideus superior consists of a few scattered muscular fibres, which pass forward in the fold of mucous membrane forming the late- ral boundary of the entrance into the larynx, from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis. The aryteno-epiglottideus inferior, closely coimected with the sacculus laryngis, may be seen l)y raising the mucous membrane immediately above the ventricle of the larjnix. It arises by a narrow and fibrous origin from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attach- ment of the vocal cord ; and passiug forwards and a little upwards expands over the upper half or two-thirds of the sacculus laryngis ; it is inserted by a bi'oad attachment into the side of the epiglottis. The hyo-epiglottideus has not hitherto been described as a normal muscle of the human larynx. From the investigations, however, of Dr. John Macintja'e in the dissecting-room of St. Mungo's College, it would appear that it is invai'iably present, although vaiying much in the degree of its development. It generally consists of three muscular slips lying beneath the glosso- epiglottidean folds, and passing from the iiyoid bone to the front of the epiglottis. The muscles of the larynx are so intimately connected with each other, that the sejjaration into those above named and described is Fig. 395.â€”Posterior view of the larynx, i. Epiglottis. 2.

The most distinct muscle is the crico-thyroid, and next to this the crico-arytenoideus posticus ; the others are so united as to form a complete sphincter muscle, sphincter laryngis, which encloses the cavity of the glottis, and spreads out over the vocal cords and arytenoid cartilages, some of the fibres even reaching to the cornicula larviigis. Actionsâ€”The crico-arytenoidei postici open the glottis while all the rest close it. The arytenoideus approximates the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly, and the crico-arytenoidei laterales and thyro- aiytenoidei anteriorly ; the latter, moreover, close the glottis mesi- ally. The crico-thyroidei are tensors of the vocal cords, and these muscles, together with the thyro-arytenoidei, regulate the tension, position, and vibrating length of the vocal cords. The crico-thyroid muscles effect the tension of the vocal cords by rotating the inferior cornua of the thyroid on the cricoid; by this Fig. 396.â€”Side view of larynx, one ala of thyroid cut through and turned down. i.

Tracliea. action the anterior portion of the thyroid is drawn downwards, and made to approximate the upper edge of the cricoid, thus separating it further from the arytenoid to which the vocal cords are fixed. The crico-arytenoidei postici separate the vocal cords by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages outwards and down- wards. The crico-arytenoidei laterales, by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages forwards, approximate the anterior angles to which the vocal cords are attached. The thyro-arytenoidei draw the arytenoid cartilages forwards, and, by their connection with the vocal cords, make the whole length or any segment of the cords tense. The thyro-epiglottideus acts principally by compressing the glands of the sacculus lai^yngis and the sac itself : by its attachment to the epiglottis it would act feebly upon that valve. The aryteno-epi- glottideus superior serves to keep the mucous membrane of the sides of the opening of the glottis tense, when the larynx is drawn682 LARYNX. iqnvaixls and the opening closed by the epiglottis. Of the ai-yteiio- epiglottideus inferior, tlie functions appear to he, to conipi-ess tli(; subjacent glands which open into the jtouch ; to diininisli the capa- city of that cavity, and change its form ; and to approximate the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilage. Mucous Membrane.â€”The aperture of the larynx is a triangular or cordiform opening, broad in front and narrow behind ; bounded anteriorly by the epiglottis, posteriorly by the arytenoideus muscle, and on either side by a fold of mucous membrane stretched between the side of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilage. On the margin of this aryteno-epiglottidean fold tlie cuneiform cartilage forms a i^rominence more or less distinct. Between these folds and the ala of the thyroid, on each side, is a large fossa lined by mucous membrane, and named the hyoid or innominate fossa ; be- neath its mucous lin- ing the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves communicate, and the branches of the superior and infe- rior thyroid arteries anastomose. The cavity of the larynx is divided into two parts by an oblong constriction pro- duced by the pro- minence of the vocal cords. That portion of the cavity which lies above the con- striction is broad and triangular above, and narrow below; that which is below it, is narrow above and broad and cylindrical below, the circumference of the cylinder corresponding with the ring of the cricoid ; while the space in- cluded by the constriction is a narrow, triangular fissure, the glottis or rima glottidis. Tlie form of the glottis is that of an isosceles triangle, l)ounded on the sides by the vocal cords and inner surface of the arytenoid cartilages, and behind by the arytenoideus muscle : the jiart of the chink of the glottis which lies between the vocal cords is often described as the vocalising area, and the smaller posterior portion as the reqnratory area. Its length is greater in the male than in the female, and in the former measures somewhat less than an inch. Immediately above the prominence caused by the vocal cord, and extending nearly its entire length on each side of the cavity of the larynx, is an elliptical fossa, 397-â€” Vei-tical sec- tion of larynx, show- ing its ligaments. i.

This fossa is bounded below by the true vocal cord, which it serves to isolate, and above by a border of mucous membrane folded upon the lower edge of tlie superior thyro-arytenoid ligament (superior or false vocal cord). The whole of" the cavity of the larynx, with its prominences and depressions, is lined by mucous membrane, continuous superiorly with that of the mouth and pharynx, and prolonged inferiorly through the trachea and broncliial tubes into the lungs. In the ventricles of the larynx the mucous membrane forms a csecal pouch of variable size, termed the sacculus laryngis. The sacculus laryngis is directecl upwards, sometimes extending as high as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and occasionally above that border. When dis- sected from the interior of the larynx it is found (Covered by the aryteno-epiglottideus muscle and a fibrous membrane, which latter is attached to the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament loelow ; to the epiglottis in front; and to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage above. If examined from the exterior of the larynx, it will be seen to be covered by the thyro-epiglottideus muscle. On the surface of its mucous membrane are the openings of sixty or seventy small race- mose glands, which are situated in the sub-mucous tissue, and give to its external surface a rough and ill-dissected apjjearance. The secretion from these glands is intended for the lubrication of the vocal cords, and is directed upon them by two small valvular folds of mucous membrane, wliich are situated at the entrance of the sacculus. The mucous membrane is closely connected to the epi- glottis and to the vocal cords, on the latter being remarkable for its thinness. It is invested by a columnar ciliated epithelium as high up as the superior folds of the ventricle of the larynx and lower half of the epiglottis, but on the true vocal cords the epithelium is squa- mous and non-ciliated. Glands.â€”The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with an abundance of mucous glands ; many of these are situated on the epiglottis, in the sacculus laryngis, and in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, where they are termed arytenoid. The body known as the epiglottic gland is merely a mass of areolar and adipose tissue, situated in the triangular space between the front surface of the apex of the epiglottis, the hyo-epiglottic ligament, and the thyro- hyoid ligament. Laryngoscopic Appearance.â€”When examined by means of the laryngoscope, the upper opening of the larynx presents the appear- ance of a space of abnost seuiilunar form, bounded in front by the base of the tongue and behind by the wall of the pharynx. lii the anterior jjart of this space the curved free extremity of the epiglottis (Fig. 398, e) is seen, and projecting into the space from before, m tlie middle line, the cushion of the epiglottis {cu). In the middle line behind is a narrow slit, which is the space between the two arytenoid cartilages, and on each side of this a rounded tubercle, the tip of each corniculum laryngis; a little externally to these, two other tubercles will be noticed, due to the presence of the cuneiformTRACHEA. 684 cartilages, and running from theiu outwards to tlie edges of the epiglottis, two crescentic folds of mucous membrane, tlie aryteno- epiglottidean folds. In tlie middle of tlie space, four flattened bands will be seen, two on each ssjde; 'a:!^ these are the true {ivc) and false (svc) vocal cords ; be- tween the former lies the narrow chink or fissure of the glottis. Nerves.â€”The arteru'S of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The nert-es are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal; both branches of the pneumo- gastric. The two nerves communicate with each other, but the superior laryngeal is distributed principally to the mucous mem- brane at the entrance of the larynx ; the recurrent to the muscles.

Vessels and THE TRACHEA. The trachea or wind-pipe is cylindrical for about two-thirds of its circumference, and flattened on the posterior third, where it rests on the oesophagus ; it extends from oj)posite the upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra to opposite the fourth dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi. The length of the trachea is about four inches (l I cm.), and its diameter from side to side nearly an inch (21 mm.); it is someM'hat larger in the male than in the female. The right bronchus, larger than the left, passes off nearly at right angles, to the upper part of the corresponding lung. The left descends obliquelyy and passes beneath the arch of the aorta, to reach the left lung. The trachea is composed of cartilaginous rings, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, elastic tissue, and is lined by mucous membrane. The cartilaginous rings are from fifteen to twenty in number, and extend for two-thirds around its cylinder, being deficient at the Ijosterior part. The first ring is received within the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage, and is broader than the rest; the last is broad at the middle in consecpience of the prolongation of tlie lower border into a triangular process Avhich curves backwards at the point of bifurcation. The posterior extremities of the rings are rounded, and occasionally one or two rings will be found to bifui'cate. The â– * outer surface of eacli ring is flat, the inner is convex from above downwards. The fibrous membrane connects the rings and forms a thin covering to them on the outer surface. Internally it does not reacli the surface, and the I'ings have in consequence on that aspect an appearance of greater prominence. It also stretches across between the rings on the posterior part of tlie trachea. The muscular fibres are disposed transversely across the sjiace,685 TRACHEA. between the extremities of the rings behind. They are placed internally to the fibrous membrane. Outside the circular fibres are bundles within the rings, and internally to the muscular layer behind. It is most developed opposite the bifurcation of the trachea. The mucous membrane, which is pale, forms the internal lining of the tube, and has ojjening upon its surface the excretory tubes of numerous mucous glands, the glands themselves lying external to the muscular coat; it is furnished with a ciliated columnar epithelium, continuous Avith that of the larynx above and the bronchial tubes below. Beneath the columnar cells and surround- ing their bases is a collection of small irregular cells {Debove's layer), many of which become distended with mucus and form goblet cells. The mucous membrane contains a large amount of lymphoid tissue. The mucous glands are small ovoid bodies situated between the fibrous membrane and the muscular layer behind, and in the sub- stance of the fibrous membrane between the rings. Their ducts open upon the mucous membrane. Nerves.â€”The nerves of the trachea are derived from the vagus and its recurrent branch ; they form a fine gangliated plexus on the outside of the muscular coat, the nerve filaments becoming non- medullated. The bronchi correspond very closely in structure with the trachea ; the cartilaginous rings are deficient behind, as in that tube ; there are usually six to eight rings in the right bronchus and ten to twelve in the left. The right bronchus is the more horizontal of the two, but it is shorter than the left; it is larger, and is more directly continuous with the trachea, so that foreign bodies getting into the windpipe commonly pass into the right bronchus. The right gives off a branch above the pulmonary artery {eparterial bronchus) as well as branches â– below Qiyf arterial); the left gives off the latter only. The thyroid body consists of two lobes, placed one on each side of the trachea, and connected with eacli other by means of an isthmus, wliich crosses its upper rings, usually the third and fourth ; but in this respect there is some variety, a point necessary to be remembered a few running longitudi- nally ; they are connected with the inner surface of the ends of the rings, and wdth the external fibrous mem- brane. The elastic tissue forms the submucous tissue, and is disposed in longitudinal THYROID BODY.686 THYROID BODY, in operations on the trachea. The lobes are somewhat conical in| shape, being larger below than above, and the smaller end is con- tinued upwards to the side of the thyroid cartilage. The isthmus isl connected with the lower third of the two lolies, and often gives origin to a process of variable length and size, called the pyramid or third lobe. The pyramid is generally situated on the left side of the isthmus, and is often derived from the left lobe ; it is fre- quently connected with the hyoid bone by a muscular Vjand, which receives the name of levator glandulce thyroidece. The left lobe is somewhat smaller than the right, the weight of the entire body Ijeing about one ounce and a half. It is, however, larger in young persons and females than in adult males, and undergoes a slight increase during menstruation. Its peruianent enlargement consti- tutes bronchocele, goitre, or the Derbyshire neck. Structure.â€”The structure of the thyroid is of a brownish-red colour, and is composed of a dense aggregation of minute and inde- pendent membranous cavities or vesicles en- closed by a plexus of capillary vessels, and connected together by areolar tissue. The vesicles are composed of a basement membrane lined by a columnar cinthelium of nucleated cells, and contain a clear yellowish fluid, in which are found cells; the latter measuring jJqq of an inch in diameter. Vessels and Nerves. â€”It is abundantly sup- plied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Some- times an additional ar- tery is derived from the arteria innominata, and ascends upon the front of the trachea to be distributed to the gland. The nerves are derived from the superior laryngeal and from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sym])athetic. The lymphatics are very numerous, and origi- nate for the most part in the connecti\'e tissue forming the stroma of the organ. THE LUNGS. The luugs are two conical oi-gans, situated one at each side of the chest, embracing the heart, and separated from each otlier by that organ.and by an interspace, the mediastinum. On the external or F:g. 400.â€”structure of the thyroid body. a. Con- nective-tissue stroma, h. Basement membrane, c. Epithelial cells.687 LUNGS. thoracic side tliey are convex, and correspond with the form of tlie cavity of the chest; internally they are concave, to receive the con- vexity of the heart. Superiorly they terminate in a tapering cone, which extends above the level of the first rib into the root of the neck, and inferiorly they are broad and concave, and rest on the con- vex surface of the diaphragm. Theii' posterior border is rounded, broad, and long; the anterior, sharp, short, and marked by one or two deep fissures ; and the inferior border which surrounds the base is also sharp. The colour of the lungs is pinkish-grey, mottled, and variously marked with black. The surface is figured with irregularly polyhedral outlines, which represent the lobules of the organ, and the area of each of these polyhedral spaces is crossed by lighter lines representing smaller lobules. The weight of the lungs is about forty- two ounces, the right lung being twenty-two ounces and the left twenty ; the ratio to the weight of the body is as i to 37 in the male and I to 42 in the female. Each lung is divided into two lobes by a long and deep fissure, called the great fissure, which extends from the posteidor surface of the upper part of the organ downwards, and forwards to near the anterior angle of its base. In the right lung the upper lobe is sub- divided by a second fissure, which extends obliquely forward from the middle of the preceding to the anterior border of the organ, and marks oft' a small triangular lobe. The left lung presents a deep notch in its anterior border, at a point corresponding with the apex of the heart. The right lung is larger than the left, in consequence of the inclination of the heart to the left side. It is also shorter, from the gi'eat convexity of the liver, which presses the diaphragm upwards on the right side of the chest, considerably above the level of the left, and it has three lobes. The left lung is smaller, has only two lobes, but is longer than the right. The healthy lung is free at all parts of its surface, excepting along the lower two-thirds of the middle of its inner surface, where it is fixed, above by the root and below by a double layer of pleura called ligamentum latum pulmonis. The root is formed by the pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, and divisions of the bronchus, together witli the bronchial vessels, lymphatic vessels and glands, and pul- monary plexuses of nerves. The groove on the surface of the lung where the vessels enter its substance is the hilum pulmonis, and the position of the large vessels in the root of the lung, as follows : from before, backwards, they are placed in a similar order on botii sides, viz. :â€” Pulmonary veins.

From above, downwards, the relative position of these structures 13 essentially the same on both sides, but on the right side there IS an additional bronchus (eparterial), which is placed above theLUNGS. 688 pulmonary artery, consequently tlie arrangement on the two sides is as follows:â€” Relations of the Roots of the Lung.â€”i.

Above, vena azygos major. In front, superior vena cava. 3. Left lung alone. Above, arch of aorta. Behind, descending aorta. The lung is of a soft spongy texture, and, from its containing air, crepitates when squeezed between the fingers. Its specific gravity- varies from .345 to .746. Wlien cut, there exudes a frothy fluid consisting of mucus and blood intimately mixed with air. In the young child the lung is of a rose-pink colour, but in the adult it is much darker from the presence of pigment; in 1)6th, the surface is mottled, from the area over the centre of each lobule being lighter than that over the periphery. The surface is marked out into small polyhedral di^asions, which are the outlines of the lobules. The lobules have their apices directed towards the centre of the lung, and their bases towards the surface; they are largest at the surface of the lung, and smallest near its centre; they are connected with each other at their apices by the smallest bronchial tubes. Each lobule is a miniature lung, and consists of bronchial tube, pulmonary artery and vein, air cells supported by an elastic stroma, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. It is isolated from surround- ing lobules by areolar tissue derived from the subserous layer; the entire lung is an assemblage of these lobules, so separated and sn connected, held together by the pleura. The serous investing membrane of the lungs or pleura is con- nected with the surface of the lobules by means of a subserous areolar tissue, which forms a distinct layer, and being prolonged between the lobules, serves to unite them. This layer contains elastic tissue, and is a chief source of the elasticity of the lungs; in it a close plexus of capillary vessels is found, and numerous lymphatics, which communicate witli the surface of the pleura by minute stomata. Bronchial Tubes.â€”The two bronchi proceed from the bifurcation of the trachea op]iosite the fourth dorsal vertebra to their correspond- ing lungs. The right, about an inch long, takes its course nearly at right angles with the trachea, passes behind the superior vena cava, and gives oft" a branch above the pulmonary artery {eparterial branch) to tlie upper lobe of the right lung : it then passes behind the artery Structure of the Lungs.689 BEONCHIAL TUBES. and gives off two otxier branches below its level {hyf arterial branches), which pass to the middle and lower lobes. The left, two inches in length, and smaller than the right, passes obliquely beneath the arch of the aorta, and divides into two branches, both of which are placed below the ])nlmonary artery (hyparterial branches), and pass to the two lobes of the left lung. From this arrangement of the bronchi it seems probable that the two lower lobes of the right lung corre- spond to the -^diole of the left, and that the upper lobe of the right is entirely additional. Upon entering the lungs the bronchi divide into branches, and each of these divides and subdivides dicho- FiG. 401.â€”Heart and lungs. I.

The bronchial tubes or bronchioles are cylindrical tubes which differ from tlie bronchi in not being flattened posteriorly, and in liaving the cartilaginous and muscular layers distributed throughout theii' entire calibre. The cartilages cease to be regular rings and become irregulai- plates, which are most developed at tlie points of division of the bronchioles, where they form a concave ridge pro- jecting into the tube ; they disappear altogether when the tube is reduced to one millimetre in diameter. Connecting tlie cartilages and arranged outside them is a layer of fibrous tissue forming the fihrons coat; in the smallest tubes it is found devoid of cartilage, and becoming thinner is at length continued into the areolar stroma 2 X690 LUNG. of the lobules. In this coat are numerous mucous glands, â–  which send their ducts to open on the surface of the mucous membrane. Fig. 402.â€”Transverse section of the wall of a medium-sized bronchial tube. a.

The bronchial tubes continue to diminish in size until they attain a diameter of one millimetre, when they become changed in structure, and are continued onwards in tlie midst of air-cells, under the name of alveolar passages. These passages divide into smaller ones, which teiininate by some- what dilated extremities, called infun- dibula, the walls of which are every- where crowded by hemisiDlierical saccult> called alveoli or air cells.

Near the apex of the lobule the cells open singly into the alveolar jDassage, but at the base they are clustered, and several cells com- municate with each other before opening into the infundibulum. The wall of the air-cells is com- posed of the stromal tissue of the lung, formed in large part of yellow elastic tissue, with are- olar tissue and a few muscular fibres mixed. The white fibres are distinguished by numeroiis corj)uscles scattered throughout them. The air-cells are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, most of which are large flat cell- FiG. 404.â€”Two primary lobuli or infundi- bula. a, a. Exterior of lobules, b, b.

Smallest bronchia. plates without a nucleus, but there are others which are small, polygonal, and nucleated, and these are placed in groups of two or three cells over the interstices of the capillary plexus. The capillaries of the lungs form plexuses which occupy the walls and septa of the air-cells and the walls of the alveolar passages, but are not continued into the bronchial tubes. The capillary plexus in the wall of each air cell consists of a single layer of vessels, which is so disposed that it is ex- posed to the air con- tained in two contiguous air-cells. The air-cells of the central part of tlie lung are most vas- ciUar, and at the same time smallest, whilst those of the jieriphery are less vascular and lavrrnT- 40.S-â€”Arrangement of the capillaries of the . human lung. The pigmentary mat- ter of the lungs is contained in the -vyalls of the air-cells, as well as in the areolar tissue of the inter-lobular spaces and blood-vessels ; it is composed chiefly of carbon. The pulmonary artery, conveying the dark and impure venousLUNG. 692 blood to the lungs, accompanies the bronchial tulies to the lung, and divides as the tubes divide. The branches terniinate in capillary vessels, which form a dense network in the parietes of the alveolar passages and air-cells, and then converge to form the pulmonary veins, by which the arterial blood, purified in its passage through the capillaries, is returned to the left auricle of the heart. In their course through the lung, the artery is commonly found above and behind the bronchial tube, while the vein is below and in front. The bronchial arteries, branches of the thoracic aorta, ramify on the parietes of the bronchial tubes, and terminate partly in bron- chial veins which convey the venous blood to the vena azygos on the right side, and superior intercostal vein on the left; and j)artly in the pulmonary capillaries. The lymphatics on the surface of the lung form a fine sub-pleural plexus, communicating by means of stomata with the pleural cavity. Those in the substance of the lung consist of two sets, one of which forms an elaborate plexus beneath the mucous membrane of the bron- chial tubes, and the other originates in capillaries between the air-cells and alveolar passages. They all ter- minate in the bronchial glands at the root of the lung. These glands, very numerous and often of largi- size, are placed at the roots of the lungs, around tlie bronchi, and at the bifurcation of the trachea. In early life they resemljle lymphatic glands in other situations ; but in old age, and often in the adult, are black, and filled with carbonaceous matter, and occasionally with cal- cai'eous deposits. . The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. They form two plexuses : anterior pulmonary plexus, situated upon the front of the root of the lungs, and composed chiefly of fila- ments from the deep cardiac plexus ; and posterior pulmonary plexus, on the posterior aspect of the voot of the lungs, composed principallv of branches from the pneumogastric. The branches from these plexuses follow the course of the bronchial tubes, and arc distributed to the intercellular passages and air-cells. Fig. 406.â€”Capillai-y network of an air cell. a.

Each lung is enclosed and its structure supported by a sei'ous membrane, the pleura, which invests it as far as the root, and is then reflected on the parietes of the chest. That portion of the membrane which is in relation with the lung is called pleura pid- monalis, and that in contact with the parietes, pleura costalis. The pulmonary pleura is very thin, is elastic, and inseparably connected with the structure of the lung ; the costal pleura is thick and strong, has very little elasticity, and can be readily strij)ped off the ribs and intercostal muscles which it covers. The latter, besides forming the internal lining to the ribs and intercostal muscles, also covers the diaphragm and thoracic surface of the vessels at the root of the neck, extending for somewhat more than an inch above the margin of the first rib. At the lower border of the root of the lung is a fold of the pleura, which extends down by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the diaphragm, and serves to retain the low'er part of the lung in jDOsition. This fold is the broad ligament of the lung, ligamentum latum pulmonis. At the right side, where the diaphragm is pressed uj)wards by the liver, the cavity of the j)leura is shorter than on the left; while the left pleural cavity, in consequence of the encroachment of the heart on the left side of the chest, is narrower than the right. The right pleura extends at its' anterior limit to the lower border of the seventh rib, in the axillary line to the ninth rib, and behind to the eleventh rib. The left pleura reaches to a lower level all round than the right; in the axillary line it touches the lower border of the tenth rib. MEDIASTINUM. The two pleural sacs do not communicate with each other, but liave between them a space which contains all the viscera of the chest with the exception of the lungs. This is called the inter- pleural space or mediastinum. The mediastinum is divided into an anterior, middle, posterior, and superior portion. The anterior mediastinum is a triangular space, bounded in front by the sternum, triangularis sterni, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles ; behind by the pericardium and the remains of the thymus gland, and at each side by the pleura. It contains a quantity of "loose areolar tissue, in which are found some lymphatic vessels passing upwards from the liver, and mediastinal lymphatic glands. Dissection of the anterior mediastinum.â€”This space is best displayed by (i) dividing the sternum transversely on a level Avith the lower border of the first costal cartilages ; (2) dividing the same bone transversely between the fifth and sixth costal cartilages ; (3) cutting the sternum obliquely, commencing iiear the light end of the first cut,_ and terminating at the left end of the second. The two halves of the sternum can now be separated and the anterior mediastinum exjjosed. (Turner.)694 MEDIASTINA. The middle mediastinum contains the heart enclosed in its peri- cardium, the ascending aorta, superior vena cava, pulmonary arteries and veins, bifurcation of tlie trachea, and phrenic nerves with their accompanying vessels. With the exception of the tracliea and phrenic nerves, the whole of the contents of this space lie within the pericardium. The posterior mediastinum is bounded behind by the vertebral column, m front by the pericardium, and at each side by the pleura It contains the thoracic aorta, the greater and lesser azygos veins and superior intercostal veins, the thoracic duct, esophagus and pneumogastric nerves, the great splanchnic nerves, and some lym- phatic glands. superior mediastinum is the part of the interpleural space which lies above the pericardium, and is bounded in front by the Fig. 407.â€”Transverse section of the tliorax. i.

THYMUS BODY. The thymus is a temporary organ, which is of large size in the young child, but in the adult is reduced so as to become a mere vestige ; it occupies the anterior mediastinum^ and lies in relation with the pleurae and pericardium. In its mature state it consists of a thoracic and a cervical portion on each side. The former is situated in the anterior mediastinum, and the latter is placed in the neck just above the first bone of the sternum and behind the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. It extends upwards from the fourth rib as high as the thyroid gland, resting against the pericardium, separated from the arch of the aorta and great vessels by fdscia, and lying at each side of the trachea in the neck. Although described usually as a single mass, it consists actually of two lateral, almost symmetrical lobes, connected with each other .by areolar tissue only, and having no structural communication ; they may therefore be properly called a right and left tliymus body. The thymus is perceptible as early as the seventh week of em- bryonic existence, and continues gradually increasing Avith the growth of the f cetus until the seventh month. At the eighth month it is large ; during the ninth it undergoes a sudden change, assumes a greatly increased size, and at birth weighs 240 grains. After birth it continues to enlarge until the expiration of the second year, when it ceases to grow, and begins to diminish between the eighth and twelfth year, being often well developed at the age of twenty, and only disajDpearing entirely before forty. The two lateral lobes of which it consists, are of an elongated pyramidal form, with their bases resting on the pericardium, and tlieir apices reaching to the thyroid Ijody. Each lobe consists of a number of polyhedral lobules, held together by connective tissue, and enclosed in a fibrous capsule. The lobules, somewhat more than a quarter of an inch in dia- meter, are composed of smaller lobules, and the smaller lobules are made iip of small round or polygonal solid masses, the nodules or follicles. These are in every respect similar in structure to the lymphoid masses found in other parts of the body, as, for instance, in the tonsils, and the solitary and agminate glands of the intestine. They consist of retiform tissue, the meshes of which are crowded with lymph corpuscles ; at the circumference of each nodule tlie retiform tissue is closer so as to form a sort of capsule. Scattered throughout the retiform tissue are peculiar, highly refracting corpuscles, which present an appearance of concentric striation, and have been named the concentric corimsclcs of Hassall. The arteries of the thymus gland are derived from the internal696 ABDOMEN. mammary, suiDerior thyroid, and inferior thyroid. The veins ter- minate in the left innominate vein, and some small branches in tlie thyroid veins. The nerves are minute, and derived chiefly, through the internal mammary plexus, from the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. Other branches reach the gland from the phrenic, pneumogastric, and descendens cervicis nerves. The lymphatics accompany the blood-vessels in the interior of the gland, terminate in the general union of the lymphatic vessels at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. ABDOMEN. Tlie abdomen is the inferior cavity of the trunk of the body ; it is bounded in front, and at the sides, by the lower ribs and abdominal muscles ; behind, by the vertebral column and abdominal muscles ; iG. 408.â€”Viscera of the abdomen in situ, i, i.

Tlins, if two transverse lines be carried around the body, tire one jaarallel with the cartilages of the ninth ribs, the other with the highest point of the crests of the ilia, the abdomen will be divided into three zones. Again, if a perpendicular line be drawn, at each side, from the cartilage of the eightli rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament, the three primary zones will each be subdivided into three compartments or regions, middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone being immediately over the small end of the stomach, is called epigastric (eVt yaarrjp, over the stomach). The two lateral regions being under the cartilages of the ribs, are called right and left hypochondriac (vtto xovdpot, under the cartilages). The middle region of the middle zone is the umbilical; the two lateral, the lumbar. The middle region of the inferior zone is the hypogastric (vtto yaarrjp, below the stomach); and the two lateral, the iliac. In addition to these divisions, we employ the term inguinal region, in reference to the vicinity of Poupart's ligament. Position of the Viscera.â€”The position of the viscera which occupy these several regions may be best xmderstood and remem bered, by arranging them in a tabular form, as follows :â€¢â€” Right Hypochondriac.

If the cavity contain only a single viscns, the consideration of the serous meml)rane is extremely simple. But in tlie abdomen, where there are a number of viscera, the serous membrane ]:)asse.s from one to the other until it has invested tlic Fig. 409. â€” Reflections of the peritoneum, d. Diaphragm. L.

Hence its reflections are a little more complicated. In tracing the reflections of the peritoneum, in the middle liuc, we commence with the diaphragm, which is lined by two layeis, one from the parietes in front, anterior, and one from the parietes behind, i^osterior. These two layers of the same membrane, at llu' posterior part of the diaphragm, descend to the upper surface of llif liver, forming the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liyei. They then surround tlie liver, one going in front, the other behiud that viscus, and meeting at its under surface, pass to the stomach,699 PERITONEUM. forming the lesser omentum. They then, in the same manner, surround the stomach, and meeting at its lower border, descend for some distance in front of the intestines, and return to the transverse colon, forming the great omentum ; they then surround the trans- verse colon, and pass directly backwards to the vertebral column, forming the transverse meso-colon. Here the two layers separate ; the 'posterior ascends in front of the pancreas and aorta, and returns to the posterior jDart of the diaj)hragm, where it becomes the posterior layer with which we commenced. The anterior descends, invests all the small intestines, and returning to the vertebral column, forms the mesentery. It then descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, which it holds in its place by means of a fold called meso- rectum, forms a pouch, the recto-vesical fold, between the rectum and the bladder, ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, forming its false ligaments, and returns upon the anterior jDarietes of the abdomen to the diaphragm, whence we first traced it. In the female, after descending into the pelvis in front of the rectum, it is reflected upon the posterior surface of the vagina and uterus. It then descends on the anterior surface of the uterus, and forms at either side the broad ligaments of that organ. From the uterus it ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, and anterior parietes of tlie abdomen, and is continued, as in the male, to the diaphragm. In like manner the peritoneum can be traced as a continuous slieet from one side to the other side of the abdomen. Thus, if we commence at the middle line in front and follow it across the ab- domen below the level of the transverse colon, "we shall find that it passes from the abdo- minal Avail to the right iliac fossa where it covers in the caecum and as- colon, the meso - caecum and ascending meso-colon ; it ti l en passes in- cending forming Fig. 410.â€”Transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of Winslow.

Above the transverse colon tlie arrangement is moi complicated, in consequence of the existence of two cavities, a greali-i' and a lesser. Beginning at the middle line we may trace the peri- toneum over the right kidney into the right hypochondrium ; it then passes across the body in front of the pancreas, and returns from left to right along the posterior surface of the stomach, .so as to reacli the foramen of Winslow, where it forms the posterior layer of tlie lesser omentiim. It now becomes reflected on itself round the struc- tures (hej)atic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct) formiug the pillar of the foramen of Winslow, and constitutes the anterioi layer of the lesser omentum. Passing over the anterior surface of the stomach, it is continued on the spleen, which it encloses (form- ing the gastro - splenic omentum), and so passes to the left hypochondrium, and from thence to the anterior wall of tin- abdomen. Processes of Peritoneum.â€”The folds of peritoneum serve the purpose of connecting the viscera with the abdominal M'all or with each other, and thus limiting their movement. Those attached to the stomach are called omenta (greater, lesser, and gastro-sflenk); those attaching the hollow viscera to the wall have the jirefix meso-, as mesentery, meso-colon, meso-csecum, meso-sigmoid, &c.; other folds more limited in extent receive the name of ligaments, such as those of the liver, stomach, urinary bladder, and uterus. The following is a brief description of these processes :â€” The lesser omentum (gastro-hepatic) is the duplicature which passes between the Hver and the uiDjjer border of the stomach. It is extremely thin, excepting at its right border, where it is free, and contains l)etween its layers theâ€” Hepatic artery, Portal vein, Common bile duct. Lymphatics, Hepatic plexus of nerves. These structures are enclosed in a loose areolar tissue called Glis- son's capsule. The relative position of the three vessels is, the artery to the left, the duct to the right, the vein between and behind. If the finger be introduced behind the right border of the lesser omentum, it ^\'ill be situated in an opening called the foramen of Winslow. In fro7it of the finger will lie the right border of the lesser omentum", containing the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct; behind it, the right crus of the diaphragm and in- ferior vena ca^'a covered by the ascending or posterior layer of the peritoneum ; below, the hepatic artery, cur^^ng forward from the cceliac axis, and the ascending i)ortion of tlie duodenum ; and above, the lobus Spigelii. These, therefoi-e, are the boundaries of the fora- men of JVi7islow, which is nothing more than a constriction of the general cavitv of the peritoneum at this ])oint, arising out of thePEEITONEUM. 701 necessity for the hepatic and gastric arteries to pass forwards from the cieliac axis to reach their respective viscera. If air be blown through the foramen of Winslow, it will descend behind the lesser omentum and stomach to the space between the descending and ascending pair of layers, forming the great omen- tum. This is sometimes called the lesser cavity of the peritoneum, and that external to the foramen the greater cavity ; in which case the foramen is considered as the means of communication between the two. It may be objected to this division that it tends to lead the inexperienced to believe that there are two cavities, while, in i-eality, there is but one, the foramen of Winslow being merely a constriction of that one, to facilitate the communication between the nutrient arteries and the viscera of the upper part of the abdomen. The great omentum (gastro-colic) consists of four layers of peri- tmeum, the two which descend from the stomach, and the same two, returning upon themselves to the transverse colon. A qiiantity of adipose substance is deposited around the vessels which ramify through its structure. In the foetus and young child, and occa- sionally in the adult, it is possible to separate the ascending layers of the gi^eat omentum from the transverse colon, and to trace them to the vei'tebral column on the upper surface of the transverse meso- colon, with which, however, they are only loosely connected. Under these circumstances the latter fold is formed by a separate dupli- cature of the peritoneum, and is not the direct continuation of the omentum, as in tlie description above given. The transverse meso-colon {^lea-os, middle, being attached to the middle of the cylinder of the intestine) is the medium of con- nection between the transverse colon and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It affords to the nutrient arteries a passage to reach the intestine, and also forms a transverse septum across the abdominal cavity. On reaching the posterior wall of the abdomen, its two layers separate from each other on the anterior aspect of the trans- verse duodenum, the one ascending to cover in the pancreas, kidneys, and sujjra-renal capsules, and to pass from thence to the under surface of the diaphragm, the other descending to form the ' mesentery, and then passing into the pelvis. The mesentery (ixea-ov evrepov, connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine) is the medium of connection between the small intestines and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is very narrow at its vertebral edge, measuring usually about six inches, while on its visceral border it measures from fifteen to eighteen feet; it thus presents the appearance of a gigantic fan folded on itself. It is oblique in direction, being attached to the posterior wall, from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa ; retains the small intestines in their place, and contains between its folds the mesenteric arteries, veins, nerves, lymphatic glands, and lacteal vessels. The meso-rectum, in like mamrer, retains the rectum in con-PEKITONEUM. 702 nection witli the front of the sacrum. Besides this, there are some minor folds m the pelvis, as the recto-vesical fohl, the false liga- ments of the bladder, and the broad ligaments of the uterus The ligaments of the liver, uterus, and urinary bladder will be fully discussed in the description of those organs. The appendices epiploicse are small irregular pouches of tlie peritoneum, filled with fat, and attached like fringes to the coh>^\, and upper part of the rectum. _ Three other duplicatures of the peritoneum are situated in tlici sides of the abdomen; they are the gastro-phrenic ligament, the gastro-splenic omentum, the ascending and descending meso-colon, and the costo-colic ligament. The gastro-phrenic ligament is a small duplicature of the peritoneum, which descends from tlie diaphragm to the extremity of the oesophagus, and lesser curve of the stomach. The gastro-splenic omentum (ligamentum gastio- lienale) is the duplicature which connects the spleen to the stomacli. The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects the upj.er part of the ascending colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; and the descending meso-colon, that which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the abdominal wall. The costo-colic ligament (sustentaculum lienis) is a fold of peritoneum which stretches from the diaphragm al^out the level of the tenth (iv eleventh rib on the left side, to the splenic flexure of the colon ; it supports the spleen. Review of the Relations of the Peritoneum to the Abdomi- nal Viscera.â€”The liver is entirely covered by peritoneum, excepting a triangular area on its upper surface, where the coronary and falci- form ligaments meet, and its posterior border, including the lol)ns Spigelii. The stomach may be considered as 2>ractically entirely covered by peritoneum, but Cathcart has pointed out that there is a triangular area at the back where it rests against the left crus of the dia]Dhragm which is uncovered. The spleen is entirely covered. The ascending duodenum and the whole of the jejunum and ilium are entirely enveloped ; the descending and transverse parts of the duodenum are covered only in front. The transverse colon has peritoneum all round it. The ascending and descending portions vary in their arrangement; the ca3cum is usually completely covered so that there is a meso-caecum, and the same thing is true of the sigmoid flexu.re, a meso-sigmoid being generally present. The ascending and descending parts of the large bowel are commonly covered only in front, but in many cases tlie descending colon has a meso-colon and is thus completely covered, and in less frequent examples the ascending colon is in the same condition. The ujiper part of the rectum has a meso-rectum ; the part below this is covered only on the front and sides ; the next part has ijeritoneum only in front, and the last has no relation to that membrane. The jiancreas, kidneys, and sui^ra-renal capsules are covered only in front. The relation of the peritoneum to the pelvic organs will be considered when the organs themselves are described.ALIMENTARY CANAL. 703 ALIMENTARY CANAL. The alimentary canal is a mnsculo-niembranons tube, extending from the mouth to the anus. It is variously named in the different parts of its course, and is divided into theâ€” Mouth, Pharynx, (Esophagus, Stomach, {Duodenum, (Csecum, Jejunum, Large intestine < Colon, Ileum, (Eectum. The mouth is the irregular cavity which contains the organ of taste and the principal instruments of mastication. It is bounded in front by the lips ; on each side by the internal surface of the cheeks ; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw ; beloiv, by the tongue, the mucous membrane stretched between the arch of the lower jaw and the under surface of the tongue, and by the teeth of the inferior maxilla ; and behind by the soft palate and fauces. The lips are two fleshy folds formed externally by integument and internally by mu.cous membi'ane, and containing between these two layers, muscles, a quantity of fat, and numerous small labial glands. They are attached to the surface of the upper and lower jaw, and each lip is connected to the gum in the middle line by a fold of mucous membrane, frena or frenula. The cheeks are continuous with the lips, and form the sides of the face ; they are composed of integument, a large quantity of fat, muscles, mucous membrane, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheeks is reflected above and below on the sides of the jaws, and is attached posteriorly to the anterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw. At about its middle, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, is a papilla, on which may be observed a small opening, the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland (Stenson's duct). The hard palate is a dense structure, composed of mucous mem- brane, palatine glands, areolar tissue, vessels, and nerves, and firmly connected to the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bon^s. It is bounded in front and at each side by the alveolar processes and gums, and is continuous behind with the soft palate. Along the middle line it is marked by an elevated raphe, and pre- sents at each side of the raphe a number of transverse ridges and grooves. Near its anterior extremity, and immediately behind the middle incisor teeth, is a papilla which corresponds with the ter- mination of the anterior palatine canal, and receives the naso-palatine nerves. â–  The gums are composed of a thick and dense mucous membrane, which is closely adherent to the periosteum of the alveolar processes,TONGUE. 704 and embraces the necks of the teeth. They are remarkal^le for their hardness and insensibility, and for their ckjse contact, without ad- hesion, to tlie surface of the tootli. From the neck of the tooth tliey are reHected into the alveolus and become continuous witli the periosteal membrane of that cavity (alveolo-dental membrane). The tongue has been already described as an organ of sense ; it is invested by mucous membrane, which is reflected from its mvlav Fig. 411.â€”Median section of mouth, nose, pharynx, and larynx, a.

On the under surface of the tongue, near its anterior part, the mucous membrane forms a considerable fold, which is called the fraenum linguae, and on each side of the frainum is a large papilla, caruncula mhlingualk, the termination of the duct (Wharton's duct) of the submaxillary gland. Running back from this papilla is a ridge occasioned by the705 SOFT PALATE. IDromiiience of the sublingual gland, and oiDening along tlie summit of this ridge a number of small openings, the apertures of the excre- tory, ducts (ducts of Kivinus) of the gland. Posteriorly the tongue is connected with the os hyoides Ijy muscle, and to the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane, the glosso-epiglottic folds. The soft palate (velum pendulum palati) is a fold of mucous membrane situated at the posterior part of the mouth. It is con- tinuous, superiorly, with the hard palate, and is composed of a double fold of mucous membrane, containing muscles, glands, and blood- vessels ; it is concave towards the mouth and convex towards the jjharynx, and presents a free festooned edge inferiorly. The structures forming the soft palate may be briefly STunmed up as follows :â€” Muscles: Two levatores palati, two tensores palati, two jDalati glossi, two palati pharyngei, azygos uvulae. Palatine aponeurosis. Palatine gkoids. Arteries: Ascending j)alatine, descending palatine, palatine branch of ascending pharyngeal. Nerves: Descending palatine and external palatine from spheno-palatine ganglion. The mucous membrane is continuous with that of the liard palate, but is thinner and darker, and is covered by stratified sq^uamous ej)ithelium, ex- cepting at the extreme upper part of its posterior surface, near the opening of the Eustachian tube, where it is columnar and ciliated. The palatine glands are most numerous on the joosterior surface of the velum and covering the uvula ; they are small compound race- mose glands. Hanging from the middle of the inferior border of the soft palate is a small rounded process, the uvula, and passing outwards from the nvula at each side are two cui-ved folds of the mucous membrane, the arches or pillars of the fauces. The anterior pillar is continued downwards to the side of the base of the tongue, and is formed by the prominence of the j^alato-glossus muscle. The posterior pillar is prolonged downwards and back- wards into tlie pharynx, being formed b}'- the convexity of the palato-pharyngeus muscle. These two pillars, closely united above, are separated below by a triangular interval or niche, in which the tonsil is lodged. The space included between the soft palate and the root of the tongue is the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded above by the soft palate, on each side by the pillars of tlie soft palate and tonsil and below by the root of the tongue. It is the opening between the mouth and pharynx. The tonsils (amygdalaj) are two glandular organs, about half an inch in length, shaped like almonds, and situated between the anterior and posterior pillar of the soft palate, at each side of the fauces. Externally, they are invested by the pharyngeal fascia, which separates them from the superior constrictor muscle and internal carotid artery, and prevents an abscess from opening iu that direction ; they correspond iu position to the angles of the lowei' jaw, behind which they may be felt when enlarged. They present on their surface the openings of twelve to fifteen mucoiis crypis similar to those at the root of the tongue and described below under 2 yGLANDS OF MOUTH. 7o6 the name of lingual glands. The sub.stance of the tonsil is formed of a great numl^er of lymphoid nodules, with some looser reticulai tissue between them. The mucous glands of the mouth are racemose glands ; they are yellowisli or wliitish in colour, rounded in form, and situated in the submucous areolar tissue. The labial glands vary in size from half a line to one line and a half in diameter, and form an almost continuous layer ai'ound the mouth. The buccal glands are numerous, but smaller than the labial; a few of larger .size being located near the aperture of Stenson's duct. The molar glands are placed between the masseter and buccinator, and pierce the latter with their ducts opposite the molar teeth. The palatine glands are situated in the posterior half of the hard palate and in the soft jjalate ; in the latter forming a layer several lines in breadth. They are also numerous but small on the pos- terior part of the soft palate. The lingual glands form a thick stratum in the submucous tissue beneath the mncous crypts at the root of the tongue ; the layer of glands extends completely across the tongue, and their ducts, se\-eral lines in length, open by infun- di1:)uliform expansions, some into the mncous cryiDts, others into the foramen caecum, others into the fossa3 of the papillre circnm- vallatte, and others between the papillae. They are surrounded l)y a large quantity of lymplioid tissue which is here and there collected into round masses called Ijnnphoid nodules, many of these being grouped around the cavities of the mucous crj-jDts, Mucous glands are also dispersed on other parts of the tongue, but are smaller and few in number: a small group is found between the vertical folds on the sides of the Fig. 412.â€”Vertical section of the tonsil, i.

SALIVARY GLANDS. Communicating with tlie mouth are the excretory ducts of three pairs of salivary glandsâ€”the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. The PAROTID GLAND (napa, near ; ovs, Sjtos, the ear), the largest of the three, is situated immediately in front of the external ear, and extends superficially for a short distance over the masseter muscle ; on its deep aspect it is projected inwards by two processes, one of which lies between the styloid and mastoid processes, and fills up the back part of the glenoid cavity (glenoid lobe) ; the other passes in front of the styloid process (pterygoid lobe). It reaches inferiorly to below the level of the angle of the jaw, and posteriorly to the mas- toid process, slightly overlapping the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It is sejDarated from the submaxillary gland by the stylo- maxillaiy ligament. Embedded in its substance areâ€”tlie external carotid artery, temporo-maxillary vein, and facial nerve ; emerging from its anterior border, the transverse facial artery and branches of the facial nerve, and above, the temporal artery and auriculo- temporal nerve. On its posterior border lies the great auricular nerve, from which it receives branches. The duct of the parotid gland (Stenson's duct), about two inches in length, and about the diameter of a crow's quill, issues from the anterior jjart of the gland, just below the zygoma, and crosses the masseter muscle ; it then curves inwards over the anterior border of the muscle, and pierces the buccinator opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw ; its course through the mucous mem- brane of the cheek is very oblique, so that the posterior border of its opening forms a valvular fold, which jorevents fluid from passing from the mouth into the duct. The course taken by the duct may be roughly indicated by a line drawn from the bottom of the lobule of the ear to a point midway between the mouth and nose. The duct is dense in structure, and its walls of considerable thickness in 1 proportion to the area of the tube, which is remarkably small. A small glandular appendage, the socia parotidis, is connected with the upper part of the duct on the masseter muscle ; and opens into it by one or several small ducts. The SUBMAXILLARY GLAND, rounded in its form, is situated in the posterior part of the submaxillary triangle of the neck. It rests on the hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, and mylo-hyoid muscles, and is .covered in by the body of the lower jaw and the deep cervical fascia. It is separated from the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillarv ligament, and from the sublingual gland by the mylo-hyoid muscle. Embedded among its lobules are the facia,! artery and submaxillaiy ganglion. Its excretory duct, Wharton's duct, about two inches in length, issues from the middle of the gland, and passes between the mylo-SALIVARY GLANDS. 7o8 liyoid and hyo-glossus to the fraBnum linguae, by tlie side of which it terminates at the apex of a papilla, canmcula sublingualis.

The' SUBLIN- GUAL is a long and flattened gland, situated be- neath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, at the side of the fraenum linguae. It is in relation at the fraenum with its fellow of the opposite side, and in the rest of its course lies between the lower jaw and genio-hyo-glossus, being bounded be- low by the mylo- hyoid. It is in relation also with the duct of the submaxillary gland and the hypo- glossal nerve. Its secretion is poured into the mouth by from seven to twenty short ducts, ducts of Rivinus, which open on the ridge made by the gland in the floor of the mouth ; the larger openings being situated by the side of the fraenum linguae. One of the ducts longer than the rest, and opening close to Wharton's duct, has been named ductus Bartholini. Structure.â€”The salivary glands are of the racemose kind, con- sisting of lobes which are made up of polyhedral lobules ; and these of smaller lobules ; in minute structiu'e they correspond with the racemose glands described on p. 62. Two kinds of alveoli are, however, to be distinguished, namely, those secreting a thick, ropy fluid containing mucin, and hence called mucous alveoli; and those secreting a more waterj^ fluid often con- taining serum-albumin, and named serous alveoli. The jmrotid is composed of serous alveoli, the sublingual of mucous alveoli, but the submaxillary is mixed in character, containing both kinds. The mucous alveoli are distinguished by possessing two sets of cells, namely, large, clear, almost spheroidal mucigenous cells, with n Hat nucleus near tlie basement membrane ; and densely clustered smaller cells with oval nuclei, lying near the periphery of the alveolusDUCTS OF THE SALIVAKY GLANDS. 709 and flattened by pressure between tlie basement membrane and mucigenous cells ; these are called marginal cells {lunula of Gianuzzi). In serous alveoli the gland cells almost completely fill the alveolus, and M'hen the gland is at rest they are packed with distinct granules which obscure the nucleus ; during secretion the granules decrease in number and are limited to the periphery of the cell, so that the nucleus becomes distinct. The ducts of the salivary glands consist of a strong fibrous outer coat, beneath which are longitudinal and circular elastic layers, mixed with a few fibres of unstriped muscle ; the lining membrane is formed by a ^cfr. ^'eiitlte?i.UcSm basement membrane supportmg colum- tiie duct of a saii- nar epithelial cells.

Vessels and Nerves.â€”The parotid gland is abundantly supj^lied with arteries by the external carotid ; the submaxillary by the facial and lingual; and the sublingual by the sublingual and submental branches of the lingual artery. The capillaries form a network around and in contact with the glandular vesicles. The nerves of the parotid gland are derived from the auriculo- temporal branch of the inferior maxillary, from the auricularis magnus, and from the nervi molles accompanying the external carotid artery. In some animals the parotid also receives filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, through the lesser petrosal nerve and otic ganglion, but this distribution has not been proved to obtain in the human subject. The submaxillary gland is supplied by the branches of the submaxillary ganglion, chorda tymi3ani, sympa- thetic, lingual branch of the fifth, and sometimes filaments from the iiiylo-hyoid nerve ; and the sublingual by filaments from the sub- maxillary ganglion and lingual branch of the fifth nerve. Each salivary gland has three nerves distributed to it: (i) secretory filaments ending in the gland epithelium; (2) afferent branches, l)assing from the mucous surface on which the gland duct opens to the salivary centre ; and (3) vaso-clilator twigs to the blood-vessels supplying the gland. TEETH. Man is provided with two sets of teeth, wliicli appear the one in succession to the other ; the first are the teeth of childhoodâ€”they are called temporary, deciduous, or milk-teeth ; the second continue until old age, and are named permanent. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number, sixteen in each jaw ; they are divisil)le into foiu' classes : incisors, of which there are four in each jaw, two central and two lateral; canine, two above and two below ; bicuspid or premolar, four above and four below ; and molars, six above and six below. '710 TEETH. Tlie temporary teeth are twenty in number : eight incisors, four canines, and eight molars. Tliere are no bicuspids in the temporary set, but the eight deciduous molars are succeeded by the permanent bicuspids. The following table shows the position of tlie teeth relative to each other, in each set, and the relation of those of the temporary to those of the permanent series :â€” Mo. Cm. In. Ca. Mo.

The root is invested by periosteum, which is a bond of comiection between it and the alveolus. Characters of the Permanent Teeth.â€”The incisors (cutting teeth) are named from jDresenting a sharp and cutting edge, formed at the expense of the posterior surface. The crown is flattened from before backwards, being somewhat convex in front and concave behind ; the neck is much constricted, and the root compressed from side to side ; at its apex is a small opening for the passage of the nerve and artery of the tooth. The upjDer incisors are directed they are larger than the lower, and slightly over- Tipper central incisors are much larger than the laterals ; their inner border is a little longer than their outer, and by this character we can distinguish the side to which a particular specimen be- longs. In the lower jaw the central incisors are smaller than the lateral, and have their fangs much flattened from side to side. The fangs of the lateral incisors are also flattened, but are longer than those of the central teeth. The canine teeth (cuspidati)follow the incisors in order from before in the uijper jaw, one at each side, and two iu the lower. The crown is larger than that of the in- FiG. 416.â€”Front and side view of a left upper central incisor, a. Crown, b. Neck. c. Fang. a little forwards lap them.

The root is longer than that of all the other teetli, compressed at each side, and marked by a slight groove. The upper canine teeth (called eye-teeth) are longer and larger than the lower, and are situated a little behind and external to them. The bicuspid or premolar teeth, two at each side in each jaw, follow the canine, and are intermediate in size between them and the molars. The crown is compressed from before back- -age. wards, and surmounted by two tubercles, one internal, ^m^^ the other external, the latter being the largest. The neck is oval; the root is compressed, marked on each side by a deep groove, and bifid near its apex. The teeth of the upper jaw have a greater tendency to the division â– ^^Qj-j^^jf^" of their roots than those of the lower, and the jDOsterior sm-facTof than the anterior pair. The lower bicuspids are smaller an upper than the upper ; their outer cusp is long and prominent, bicuspid, and is bent inwards ; the inner cusp is smaller, and is connected with the outer by a slight ridge. The molar teeth (grinders), three at each side in each jaw, are the largest of the permanent set. The first molar is the largest and Fig. 419.â€”Masti- Fig. 420.â€”Masticating surface Fig. 421.â€”Masticating surface eating surface and side view of first lower and side view of second of a first upper molar of right side.

The crown is quadrilateral, and is surmounted by four or five tubercles (four in the upper, five in the loAver molars); the neck is large and round, and the root divided into several fangs. In the upper jaw the first and second molar teeth have three roots (sometimes four), more or less widely separated from each other, two of the roots being external, the otlier internal. In the lower there are but two roots, anterior and'posterior, fiattened from Ijehind forwards, and grooved so as to mark a tendency to division. The first lower molar has five cusps (Fig. 420), three outer aud two inner, the fifth cusp being postero-external; its anterior fang has two pulp cavities. The third molars, or wisdom- teeth (dentes sapientise), are smaller than the other tAvo ; they present three tid)ercles on the surface of the crown, and the root is single and grooved, appearing to be made up of four or five fangs com- pressed together, or partially divided. In the loAver jaw the fangs712 TEETH. are fretjuently separated to some distance from eacli other, and curved backwards so as to offer consideraljle resistance in the operation of extraction. The range of teeth in each jaw forms a pretty uniform curve, with- out any l^reak or diastema, such as occurs to some extent in the Quadrumana, and more markedly in the Rodents and Ruminants. Characters of the Temporary Teeth.â€”In general form these I'csemble the teeth of the permanent set, but they are smaller. The enamel which covers the crown terminates in a more distinct edge than in the permanent teeth, so that the neck is more evidently constricted. The canines are relatively shorter, and their crowns l)roader than those which succeed them. The second molar is the largest, being, indeed, larger than the second .jDermanent bicuspid which succeeds it. The first upper molar has only three cusps, the second has four ; the first lower molar has four and the second five cusps. The fangs are like those of the permanent set, but are smaller and more divergent. Structure of the Teeth. If a vertical section l)e made through a tooth, it will be fomid to be hollowed out in its interior into a small cavity, the ^;it^^j cavity, which has a general resemblance in its form to the external configuration of tlie tooth. It extends upwards a little into the cusps, and is prolonged downwards into the fangs, terminating at the extremity of eacli of the latter in a small opening which trans- mits the vessels and nerves. This cavity is filled with a soft, higlily vascular, and sen- sitive substance, called the dental 2nilp, which is continuous through the apertures at the extremity of the fangs Avith the periosteum on the outside of the tooth. The solid portion of the tooth is com- posed of three distinct structures :â€”(i) The dentine or ivory, A\'hich forms the bulk of the tooth ; (2) the enamel, which forms a thick covering to the crown; and (3) the cement, which covers the fang externally.

Upon cross section the dentinal tubules appear each to be surrounded by an annulus of consider- able thickness (Fig. 424) ; but it is probable that this appearance results from the obliquity of the sec- tion, by which a certain length of the tubes is seen as well as their extremities. The true wall of the canal can only be seen as a faint yellow ring {dentinal Fig- 424-â€”Transverse section of dtutiue, showing sheath of Neumann), and the tubules cut across, a, in the crown; B, in even this is not always inanifest. In the recent state the tubiiles are occupied by a proto- plasmic substance {dentinal fibre of Tomes), which is continuous with the nucleated cells of the dental pulp, and serves to con- vey nutritive material to the dentine ; it appears also to confer on the latter a certain amount of sensibility. The tubules are most numerous in the crown (Fig. 424, a), where they are closely crowded together, while in the fang they are much more scattered, so that here the matrix forms the largest element (Fig. 424, b). The matrix of the dentine appears to be i)erfectly homogeneous, witliotit trace of fibres or granules ; wben softened by reagents it has a tend- ency to split up into laminte, but no such lamination is observable in hard sections. The surface of tlie dentine which is in contact with the enamel is marked by hexagonal depressions, correspondingTEETH. 714 to the ends of the enamel fibres. In the fang tlie outer portion of the dentineâ€”namely, that next the cementâ€”has often a peculiai- nodular appearance (Fig. 423, b), which results from the incomplete, fusion of the calcareous masses when they are deposited. Frequent! \- also we find in this situation irregular lucunar spaces, which are filled with the same protoplasmic material as the dentinal tubules. Similar imperfect calcifications lead to the production of lamina- tion in the dentine above the pulp cavity, and of consequent parallel curved lines in the crown of the tooth called incn - mental lines.

The enamel is'covered by a thin membrane (composed of non-nucleated horny scales), which separates from it on the ajjplication of hydrochloric acidâ€”this is called the cuticle of the enamel, or Nasimjth's membrane.

Tlie cortical substance, or cement, forms a thin coating over the root of the tooth, from the termination of the enamel to the opening in the apex of the fang. In structure it differs little from true hone, being characterised by the presence of lacunae and canaliculi (Fig. 423, c) ; but it generally has no Haversian canals, although these also may appear in the cement in old age. It increases in thicloiess as age advances, and gives rise to those exostosed appear- ances occasionally seen on the teeth of very old persons, or in those Avho have taken much mercury. In old age the pulp cavity is often filled up and obliterated by osseous substance analogous to the cement, but bearing also some resemblance to dentine. This is called osteodeyitine; it is traversed by canals which are surrounded by concentric laminae, like the Haversian canals of bone. The tooth pulp, as stated above, is continuous vni\\ the periosteum of the alveolus or alveolo-dental membrane. On its surface is a layer of fine columnar cells which are in close contact externally with the inner surface of the dentine, and contain oval nuclei at their bases ; as they were supposed to be instrumental in the formation of that tissue, they have received the name of " odontoblasts." Some authors state that they give off processes which pass into the den- tinal tubules and become continuous with the fibres therein con- tained. Beneath these, numerous fusiform or pyramidal cells are found, many of which wedge themselves in between the odonto- blasts, while others are continuous Avith the ramified cells of the reticulum to be presently mentioned. Klein believes that it is this deeper cell stratum and not the layer of odontoblasts which sends processes into the dentinal tubules. The cells of the pulp, as well as the blood-vessels and nerves, are supported by a fine reticulum formed by ramified nucleated cells. Numerous non-medullated nerve fibres run through the pulp, some of which have been traced to the layer of odontoblasts, and it is probable that they also pass into the dentine. A dense network of capillaries occupies the outer part of the pulp. Development of the Teeth. At the time when the germs of the teeth first make their appear- ance the lower jaw consists of embryonic tissue, composed chiefly of branched cells, in which a cartilaginous rod, the cartilage of Meckel, is embedded. At this period the superior maxillary pro- cesses, formed also of embryonic tissue, have just met and united with the pre-maxillary or inter-maxillary processes. In the position of the future alveolar border an upgrowth of epithelial cells produces two narrow ridges arranged in a horse-shoe form ; the groove between these ridges (formerly described as the frimitive dental groove) is almost entirely filled up with cells wliich are actively growing and rapidly increasing in number. Tliis growth of cells takes a down- ward as well as an upward course so as to invade the tissue occupy- ing the position of the future jaw, but instead of passing vertically downwards becomes inclined inwards at its lower extremity (see Fig.TEETH. 7i6 427, i); in cross section this inflection of cells closely resemble- a tnbular gland. At their deepest point tlie cells increase in number more rapidly than elsewhere so as to result in the production of expansions taking somewhat the form of Florence flasks ; and it is noticeable that while the inflection of cells takes place along the whole circumference of the FiCf. 427.â– â€”Tliree stages in the dovelopnicnt of a mammalian tooth germ. o.

The e.\- jiansions have long received the name of enamel germs, ur enamel organs, al- though much dif- ference of oijiniou exists as to the part ])layed l)y them in the jjrociuction of enamel. The outer cells of the enamel organ either remain unchanged or be- slightly atro- tliose which come phied lie on its cupped or concave siirface become greatly enlongated, and their nuclei recede to their bases : the central cells become chiefly converted into a stellate reticulum, tlie processes of the cells comimuii- cating freely with each other, but those whicli lie in contact with the columnar cells next the dental papilla remain unchanged and form at DEVELOPMENT OF DENTINE. 717 stratum intermedium. During these changes, and for long after, the epithelium constituting the enamel organ remains connected with that on the siirface of the jaAV by a narrow process or neck. The dentinal papillce are first observed as slightly opaque spots at some little distance from the surface and at points corresponding to the flash-like expansions above described ; they are almost as early in making their a]Dpearance as the latter, but are at first much slower in develojiment, so that the enamel organ is for some time very large in proportion to the dentinal papilla. Not only does the dentinal paiailla grow upwards into the cupjoed ca"\dty formed hj the lower part of the enamel germ, but it also gives off lateral processes which pass to the sides of that organ, and by a continuous upward growth come later to enclose it and form the dental sac. At first the dentinal papilla only differs from the rest of â–  the substance of the jaw in being more vascular and containing more cells, but it soon assumes the form of the future tooth, becoming simply conical for a canine, having two cusps for a bicuspid, and four or five for a molar. The cells on the surface of it become distinguished from the rest by their columnar form and close aggregation, so that they form a compact layer, which, from the part it plays in the formation of the dentine, has been named the membrana eboris, the individual cells being called odontoblasts. These cells are furnished with processes by means of Avhich they commimi- : cate with each other, or ; with the cells deeper in I the pulp ; some of the pro- â–  cesses also pass into the dentine when it is formed, and become continuous with the protoplasm con- I tained in the dentinal i tubules, ' The enamel germ for I the permanent tooth is l)roduced by an outgrowth of epithelial cells from the iside of the neck of the enamel organ of the tem- porary tooth ; this passes ' to the back and inner side Fio. 428.â€”Dental sac of a tolerablj' matuve human foetus, partly diaorammatic. a\ Outer layer, and Â«2 deeper layer of fibrous wall of sac. b, b.

The dentinal papilla also of the permanent tooth grows wp beneath its enamel germ, and, assuming the characteristic shape of the tooth to be formed, has its superficial cells elongated and aggregated so as to form a membrana eboris, exactly in the same way as we have traced it in the case of the temporary tooth. The germ of the first permanent molar is formed about the sixteenth week liy a down-growth of the epithelium from the surface of the jaw, in tin- same way as the germ for the temporary teeth originated ; the second permanent molar has its germ formed from the neck of the enamel organ of the first molar about the third month after birth. The germ for the wisdom-tooth is formed from the neck of the enamel germ of the second jDermanent molar about the third year. Formation of the Hard Tissues. Enamel.â€”We have seen that the deeper cells of the enamel organ (those, namely, Avhich are next to the dentinal papilla) become elongated ; they also, by their mutual pressure, come to assume tlie form of elongated hexagonal prisms, and receive the distinctive title of enamel cells. A deposition of calcareous salts takes place in these cells, commencing at the end nearest to the papilla, and proceeding towards the centre of the enamel organ. As the process advances, the cells of the stratum intermedium assume the same form as the deeper cells, and in process of time become also calcified ; the stellate reticulum Avhich forms the great part of the enamel organ seems to take no active part in the formation of the enamel, but, as the latter is formed, becomes progressively reduced in quantity until at length the outer or suj)erficial cells (still eiDithelial in character, and become flattened) are in contact with the enamel cells. As the latter are hexagonal in form (from' mutual compression), the fibres which re- sult from their calcification are necessarily hexagonal prisms. The outer part of the cell is first calcified, the centre later, so that the outer j)art of the prismatic fibre is the hardest; and when fracture of the enamel takes place it usually follows the line of the centre of the fibre, this being less perfectly calcified than the periphery. Dentine.-^The cells which form a com- pact layer on the surface of the dentinal papilla, and are called odontoblasts, become calcified in the same manner as the enamel cells. The calcareous deposit takes place first at the surface nearest to the enamel and passes inwards along the elongated cell; while the outer part of the cell is thus converted into dentine, the inner end con- tinues to grow towards the papilla, and tlui? each dentinal tubule and its surrounding matrix is formed by the calci- fication of asingle cell, and not, as was formerly supposed, by the union Fig 429. â€” Odontoblasts situ.719 ERUPTION OF TEETH. of several. Most observers agree in stating that the dentinal matrix, dentinal sheaths, and the fibres contained in the tubules, represent three stages of calcification, the matrix exhibiting the completion of the process, the sheaths of Neumann an imperfect calcification, and the fibres being the luichanged protoplasm of the original cell. Klein is, however, of opinion that the fibres contained in the tubules are derived from the processes of the deeper layers of cells, and are not the product of the odontoblasts. The part of the dentinal papilla which is not converted into dentine, remains throughout life as the pulp of the tooth. Cement.â€”This is produced by the tissue of the tooth sac, the process being precisely the same as the production of bone beneath periosteum, described on a previous page. Eruption of Teeth. When the crown of the tooth has been formed and coated with enamel, and the fang has grown to the bottom of its socket by the progressive lengthening of the pulp, the formation of the dentine, and the adhesion of the latter to the contiguous portion of the sac, the pressure of the socket causes the reflected part of the sac and the edge of the tooth to approach, and the latter to ]3ass through the gum. The opened sac now begins to shorten more rapidly than the fang lengthens, and the tooth is quickly drawn uj)wards by the contrac- tion, leaving a space between the extremity of the unfinished root I and the bottom of the 1 socket, in which the growth and comjjletion of the fang are effected. During the changes above described as tak- ing place among the dental sacs contained within the jaws, the septa between the sacs, at first consisting of s])ongy tissue, gradually Ijecome fibrous, and sub- sequently osseous, the bone being developed from the surface and (proceeding by degrees â€¢more deeply into the jaws to constitute the â€ž alveoli Thp upcks nf 43o.â€”Aormal well-formed jaws from which the oiveun. iiie neCKS 01 alveolar plate has been removed, so as to expose the the sacs of the per- developing permanent teeth in their ciypts in the manent teeth, by which fchey originally communicated with the mucous surface of the gum, still exist, in the form of cords, separated from the deciduous teeth i720 PHARYNX. by their alveolus, but communicating through minute osseous canals with the mucous membrane of the mouth immediately beliind tlie corresponding deciduous teeth.

The 2)haryiix (cfydpvy^, the throat) is a musculo-membranous sa about four and a half inches in length, situated on the cevvi portion of the vertebral column, and extending from the base 0 the skull to a point corresponding with the cricoid cartilage i front and the upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra behind It is widest opposite the hyoid bone, and narrowest where it termi nates in the oesophagus. It is comiDosed of mucous meinbran" muscles, and a strong aponeurosis ; and communicates in front wit the cavity of the nose, mouth, and larynx. Above, it is attache partly by muscle, but chiefly by aponeurosis, to the basilar proc" of the occipital bone and petrous j)ortion of the temporal bone ; an below, it is continuous with the oesophagus. It is loosely connecte by areolar tissue with the prevertebral fascia behind, and with th styloid process and muscles and the carotid sheath 011 each sideJ Its central attachment above is by means of a strong band having its origin from the pharyngeal tubercle on the occipital bone, ana l^assing down between the recti antici muscles to terminate in llie pharyngeal aponeurosis ; this band has been termed by Cleland the cranio-2'>haryngeal ligament. _ The pharyngeal aponeurosis is a strong sheet of fascia placed between the mucous membrane and muscles of the pharynx ; it is721 PHAEYNX. strono' and thick above, but thins as it passes downwards, and at the lowe^part of the pliarynx is distinguishable only as a layer of diffuse areolar tissue. The mucous membrane varies greatly in its char- acter in different parts of the pha- rynx ; it is tliick where it clothes the base of the skull, hwt thinner in the neighbour- hood of the Eus- tachian tube, and near the j^osterior nares; in the latter situations nume- rous racemose glands are seated in the submucous Fig. 431.â€”Pharynx laid open from behind. 1.

Lymphoid tissue is everywhere abundant, and at the back part of the pharynx, forms a glandular mass stretching across between the openings of the two Eustachian tubes, which receives the name of the ijharyngeal tonsil. In the middle line, near the base of the skull, there is in the young child a small recess in the mucous niemlirane, called the hursa plumjugea; it sometimes remains permanent throughout adult life. At its anterior part the i^harynx has opening into it seven fora- mina, viz :â€” Posterior nares, two. Eustachian tubes, two, Mouth, Larynx. CEsoiDhagus. ' The posterior nares are the two large openings at the upper and front part of the pharynx. On each side of these openings, and parallel with the posterior termination of the inferior tui'binated bone, is the depression in the mucous membrane, marking the aperture of the Eustachian tube. It is bounded above and inter- nally by a prominent ridge, formed by the margin of the cartilage, covered by thick mucous membrane. Between the opening of the Eustachian tube and the liack of the pharynx is a somewhat tri- angular depression, which has been named the fossa of Rosenmilller. Beneath tlie posterior nares is the isthmus faucium, tlie large opening into the mouth, partly veiled by tlie soft palate ; and beneath the root of the tongue, the cordiform opening of the larynx. 'Jlie oesophageal opening is the lower constricted portion of the pharynx. 2 z722 (ESOPHAGUS. (ESOPHAGUS. The'a>sopliagus (o'Uiv, to bear ; (f^dyav, to eat) is a sliglitly flexiious canal, inclining to the left in the neck, to the right in tlie upi)er part of the thorax, and again to the left in its course through the posterior mediastinum ; it commences at the termination of the pharynx, opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra, and descends the neck, behind and rather to the left of the trachea. It then passes behind the arch of the aorta and left bronchus, and along the posterior mediastinum, lying in front of the thoracic aorta ; at the lower part of the thorax it lies slightly to the left of the aorta, and passing through the oesophageal opening in the diapliragm enters the al)- domen, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach opposite the lower border of the tenth dorsal vertebra. As it follows the curves of the verteljral column, it presents in its upper part an antero-pos- terior ilex are. It is about nine or ten inches in length, is narrowest at its com- mencement, and is also slightly constricted where it passes through the dia- phragm. In the relaxed condition its mucous mem- brane assumes the condi- tion of longitudinal folds, which lie in contact Antli each other; when dis- tended the folds disappear.

The vena azygos major is in relation with its right side in the thorax. Structure.â€”The oesophagus is formed of three coatsâ€”an outer, muscular; a middle, submucous or areolar; and an inner, mucous. External to the muscular coat there is, however, a layer of areolar tissue, containing many elastic fibres. The muscular coat consists in its upper part of striped fibres, but these gradually pass, about its middle, into the unstriped variety, and in its lower part the latter form only is found. The fibres are arranged in an outer longitudinal, and an imier circular layer ; the longitudinal fibres are in the upper part of the tube disposed in three fasciculi, two lateral, which are continuous with those of the inferior constrictor, and one anterior which is attached to the vertical ridge of the cricoid cartilage. The circular fibres are attached superiorly to the cricoid cartilage ; they are transverse in their arrangement, above and below, but spiral in the middle of the oesophagus. Below, both sets of fibres are con- tinuous mth those of the stomach. A band of unstriped muscle is frequently found passing from the left pleura to the oesophagus, and occasionally a similar band from the left bronchus. The submucous coat loosely connects the mucous and muscular coats ; it is thicker than the latter, is composed of areolar tissue containing many elastic fibres, and has embedded in it the glands which open on to the surface of the mucous membrane. The mucous membrane is pale in colour, but of firm texture. It is stiidded over with a number of very fine j)apillfe, and is covered by a stratified epithelium. A number of racemose glands situated in the submucous tissue, open by short ducts on to its surface. Between it and the submucous layer is a thin stratum of unstriped muscle, the fibres of Avhich are for the most part longitudinally disposed, and have been named the muscularis mucosw. THE STOMACH. The stomach is an expansion of the alimentary canal, situated in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions. The hyiDochondriac part forms fully three-fourths of the organ ; it is vertical in direction, and the fundus extends to the highest limit of the region. The epi- gastric part is transverse in direction, and lies about three fingers' breadth below the ensiform cartilage (Cunningham). On account of the peculiarity of its form, it is divided into a middle part or body, a greater or splenic, and a lesser or pyloric end; a lesser curvature above, and a greater curvature below ; an anterior and a posterior siorface; a cardiac orifice, and a pyloric orifice. The great end (fundus) is not only of large size, but expands beyond the point of entrance of the (esophagus, and is embraced by the concave surface of the spleen ; it presents superiorly a funnel-shaped expansion, leading to the cardiac orifice. The pylorus (janitor) is the small and contracted extremity of the organ; it is situated on a plane anterior and inferior to the cardiac orifice, and lies in contact with the under surface of the724 STOMACH. liver, often reaching tu tlie gall-ljladcler.

The two curvatures give attachment to the peritoneum ; the upi)er curve to the lesser omentum, the lower to the great omentum. The anterior surface looks upward and for- ward, and is in relation with the diapliragm (wliich separates it from the viscera of the thorax and six lower ribs), Avith the left lobe of tlie liver, and in the epigastric region with the alxlominal parietes. The posterior surface looks downwards and backwards, and is in re- lation with the diaphragm, ]mncreas, third portion of the duodenuiu, transverse meso-colon, left kidney, and left supra-renal body; this Fjg. 433.â€”Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duo- denum, made so as to include the two ori- fices of the stomach.

In a state of distension, as after a meal, the anterior surface becomes su]jerior, and tlie greater cur\-ature is directed forwards against the abdominal parietes. The stomach is a little lai'ger in the male than in the female, and in the former measures about twelve inches in length, and four or five inches in width at its broadest part. When moderately full it is capable of holding from five to ten pints of fluid. Connections.â€”By its iqoper border it is connected with the liver by the lesser omentum, and with the diaphragm by the gastro-phrenic ligament; by its loioer border it is connected with the transverse colon, by the great omentum. The great end is in close connection725 STRUCTUEE OF THE STOMACH. with the spleen, the bond of nnion being the gastro-splenic omentum, and its posterior surface is connected with the left crus of the dia- phragm by means of peritoneum. It is fixed at the cardiac end by the union of the oesophagus with the diaphragm, while at the pyloric end the limitation of its movement depends on the fixation of the descending portion of the duodenum. Structure of the Stomach.â€”The stomach has four coatsâ€”viz., serous, muscular, submucous, and mucous. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum and completely invests it, except at the upper and lower Ijorders, where the_ anterior and posterior layers are separated by a very small interval, in which run the gastric and gastro-epiploic arteries, and at the back part where it lies upon the left crus of the diaphragm. The muscular coat consists of unstriped fil)res arranged in three layers. The most external are longitudinal, and ex- tend from the oesophageal to the pyloric orifice. They are continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the cesophagus, and are scat- tered over the back and front of the organ, but col- lected into strong bundles along the two borders. The middle layer is disposed in circles, which commence at Fig. 434.â€”Diagram of the muscular coat of the the left extremity, and con- stomach, showing the circular, oblique, and tinue along the whole body iÂ°Â°git^^dinai fibres. of the stomach to the pylorus, where they are gathered into a mus- cular ring, which forms the contractile part of that outlet. They are very thin at the great end of the stomach, but get thicker and more distinct as they approach the pylorus. Some oblique filires, con- tiniied from the circular fibres of the esophagus, form a partial layer within the two former. They are continued from the circular fibres at the cardiac orifice, and spread out on the left of it; some of them having nearly the same direction as the circular fibres, with which, indeed, many become continuous. The submucous areolar tissue forms a third coat. It is loose and filamentous in structure, so that the next coat is comparatively feebly attached to the muscular coat. In it the blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics are distributed. The mucous membrane of the stomach is soft and loose, thinner at the cardiac than at tlie pyloric end, and of a greyish or pinkish- grey colour. It is redder in infancy than in the adult. It is so loosely connected to the muscular coat tliat wlien the stomach is distended it lias a smooth, even, mucous lining ; but when ccmtracted the membrane is tlirown into folds, or rugae. These folds, thougli not permanent, always when present assume one direction, that ]iext726 STOMACH. Fig. 435.â€”Portion of the mucous membrane of the stomach, showing the polygonal alveoli, and at the bottom of these the openings of the gastric follicles. the pylorus being disposed circularly, those over the rest of the interior longitudinally. The circular fold at the pylorus along with the muscular ring, constitutes the pyloric valve. The surface of the mucous mem- brane is covered with small dejiressions called alveoli, of a polygonal form, averaging j-i^ of an inch in diameter. They are aeeper, more marked, and more numerous near the jjylorus. In the bottom of each alveolus, and in the mucous membrane between them, are to be seen minute circular orifices of tubular glands. Four or five open into each alveolus. The gastric follicles, as they are called, are small tubes arranged i3erpendiculaiiy to the mucous surface, their closed extremities resting against the sub- mucous tissue. They are more numerous and longer at the pyloric than at the cardiac end of the stomach, and in the former situation are frequently divided at their deep extremities so as to form compound follicles. They vary in length from to t?^ of an inch, and in width from 'KUT) ^0 Tj^o inch. Two kinds of glands may be distinguished ; the first (which, it is believed, simply secrete mucus) are called mucous glands ; they are SlfflHiBiliil' ^lost numerous near the py- jHiiJiiHIlIi lorus, and are therefore some- times termed pyloric glands. The second kind are named cardiac glands, from the part of the stomach where they are most found ; as they are sup- posed to be specially engaged in the secretion of the gastric juice, they have also been named peptic glands. In both there is a basement mem- brane formed by flattened cells joined edge to edge, and from which processes spring, some to join the cells of the retiform tissue of the mucous membrane, and others to penetrate between the epithelial cells which line the glands. The lining cells differ in their character and arrangement in the two kinds of glands ; in the mucous glands they are throughout of the columnar variety, similar to those covering the surface of the mucous membrane, the only change observable in them being that in the deeper part of the gland they become cul)ical in form instead of elongated. In the cardiac glands the columnar epitlielium is found only ni the upper part (neck) of the gland, the deeper cells being splie- PiG. 436.â€”Perpendicu- lar section of the stomach in the py- loric region, show- ing its coats and the gastric glands; from the pig.

SMALL INTESTINES. The small intestine, intestinum tenue, is about twenty to twenty- five feet in length, and is divisible into three portions, duodenum jejunum, and ileum. 'SMALL INTESTINES. 728 The duodenum (called 8(o8fKaddKTv\ov by Herophilus), larger and more dee^jly seated than the rest of the small intestine, has received Its name from Ijeing about equal in length to the Ijreadth of tweh'e fingers (eight or ten inches). In its course it presents a horse-slioe curve; commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the under surface of the liver ; it next descends 2'>erpendicularly in front of the right kidney as low as the fourth lumbar vertebra, and then passes nearly transversely across the tliird lumbar vertebra ; terminating in the_ jejunum at the left side of tlie second lumlmr vertebra, whei'e it is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and Fig. 43g.â€”View of part of the abdominal viscera, showing the relations of the pancreas and duodenum, p.

The duodenum is the most fixed portion of the small in^testine. The first or ascending portion of its course, betAveen two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by the peritoneum: it is in relation, above with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder; in front with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and behind Avith the right l)OT'der of the lesser omentum and its vessels. The second or descending portion is situated altogether behind the peritoneum : it is in relation by its anterior surface with the commencement of the arcli of tlie colon ; by its iiosterior .surface with the concave margin of the right kidney, the inferior vena cava, and common l)ile duct; by its right border with tlie ascending colon ; and l)y its left border witli tlie pancreas. The common bile ductJEJUNUM AND ILEUM. 729 and pancreatic duct open into the internal and posterior side of the perpendicular portion, a little below its middle. ' The third or transverse portion of the duodenum, the longest and narrowest of the three, lies behind the diverging layers of the transverse meso-colon, with which and with the stomach it is in relation in front; above, it is in contact with the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery and vein being interposed ; and, behind, it rests on the inferior vena cava, left renal vein, the two crura of the diaphragm, and aorta. The extremity of the duodenum is held in place by a band of non-striated muscle and connective tissue, which descends to it from the coeliac axis and left crus of the diaj)hragm, and is named the musculus suspensorius duodeni. The jejunum (jejimus, empty) is named from being generally found empty. It forms the upper two-fifths of the small intestijie ; .commencing at the bend of the duodenum, on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the ileum. It is wider and thicker than the rest of the intestine, has a pinkish tinge from I containing more mucous membrane than the ileum, and is situated ' in the umbilical and left iliac regions. The ileum (e'tXeiv, to twist, to convolute) includes the remaining three-fifths of the small intestine. It is somewhat smaller in calibre, thinner in texture, and paler than the jejunum ; but there is no mark by which to distinguish the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. It is situated in the umbilical and hypogastric regions and jDelvic cavity, and terminates in the riglit ,1 iliac fossa, by opening at an obtuse angle into the commencement of 1 the colon, I The jejunum and ileum are surrounded, above and at the sides, , by the colon ; in front they are in relation with the omentum and ! abdominal parietes ; they are retained in position by the mesentery, i which connects them with the posterior wall of the abdomen; and below they descend into the cavity of the pelvis. At about the ' lower third of the ileum a pouch-like process or diverticulum of the intestine is occasionally seen. This is a vestige of embryonic structure, and results from the obliteration of the omi^halo-mesen- ' teric or ^dtelline duct at a short distance from the cylinder of the intestine. Structure of the Intestinal Canal. The intestinal canal, like the stomach, has four coatsâ€”se?-OMs, irmcsrular, submucous, and mucous. i SEROUS COAT.â€”Tlie serous layer of the small intestine is formed by the peritoneum. Tlie first or ascending portion of the duodenum is completely covered l)y the serous memljrane, with the excei)ti()n of the points of attacliment of the omenta. Tlie descending portion has only a partial covering on its anterior surface, derived from the I'ight meso-73Â° SMALL INTESTINES. colon. The transverse portion is also behind the peritoneum, being situated behind the two layers of the transverse meso-coloii. The rest of the small intestine is completely invested by it, except- ing along the concave border, to which the mesentery is attached. MUSCULAR COAT.â€”The muscular coat of the small intestine i- composed of two planes of unstriped muscular fibres, external (jv longitudinal, and internal or circular. The muscular coat is thicker in the duodenum and jejunum than in the ileum ; the longitudinal fibres are most numerous along tlit- free border of the intestine ; and the circular fibres are more (>i less oblique in direction. At the termination of the ileum tlic circular fibres are continued into the two folds of the ileo-caecfd valve, while the longitudinal fibres pass onwards to the largi- intestine. SUBMUCOUS COAT.-â€”The submucous or areolar coat is a moderately thick stratum of areolar tissue which sustains the vessels, nerve>, and glands of the mucous membrane, and connects it to the muscu- lar coat; it is thin and dense in the resophagus ; thicker and moi e distinct in the stomach ; and thicker than the other coats in the small intestine, where it is loose in texture, devoid of fat, and easily distended with air, excepting at Peyer's glands, where it is closely adherent. It is also thicker in the upper -pavt of the small intestine than below, and is one cause of the greater thickness of the duo- denum and jejunum ; moreover, it enters into the structure of tlie valvulae conniventes. MUCOUS COAT.â€”In the small intestine the mucous membrane is thinner than in the stomach ; it is smooth in the upper fourth of the duodenum, but raised into crescentic folds, valvulse conniventes (valves of Kerkring), in its lower three-fourths ; the valvules con- niventes being continued throughout the jejunum, and extending as far as the middle of the ileum. On the posterior and inner side of the descending portion of the duodenum i.s a longitudinal ridge or crest, plica longitudinalis, about an inch in length, caused by tlie oblique passage, through the walls of the intestine, of the common bile duct; and at the lower and most prominent ]3art of this crest is the aper- ture of termination of that duct and the pancreatic duct, Tlie valvulaj conniventes ai-e narrow at their comnieiu'e- nient, but ([uickly become larger ; and at the lower part of tlie dno- denuni and upper part of the jejunum, M'here they are lai-gest, liave a lireadth of several lines.

Each fold or valve extends for about one-half or three-fourths around the cylinder of the intestine ; and as they spring from all sides of its circumference, they have the appearance of circular septa. The jejunum owes its considerable thickness to these valves ; and as they are small in the upper half of the ileum and wanting in its lower half, the thinness of the latter is due to their absence. The valvnlES conniventes differ from the rugee described as present in the stomach, in that they are not obliterated when the wall of the canal is put on the stretch. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is lined on its inner surface by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells ; on its deep aspect it is bounded by a layer of unstrij)ed muscular fibre forming the muscularis mucosce. Villi and Glands.â€”Besides the larger folds on the mucous membrane, there are certain more minute structures, which can Fio. 441.â€”Mucous membrane of the small intestine, showing villi.

The villi are little conical or club-shaped projections, about om- fourth of a line in length. They are confined to the small intes- tine, and are so thickly set, especially at the upper part of tlie tuljc. that they resemble the nap of velvet, and give rise to tlie villous or velvety appearance presented by a well-washed piece of intestiiic suspended in water. They are lai-gest and most numerous in tin- duodenum and jejunum, and number from lo to i8 to the sfpiaic milliuietre ; they are fewer and less numerous in flie ileum, beiii;,' only 8 to 14 to the millimetre. In structure each villus consists of a process of the basement membrane, which is covered with a layer of columnar epithelial cells. In its interior are contained a network of capillaries, lymphoid tissue, connectiAe tissue, and a small lacteal vessel, the lattei' being the agent for the selective absorp- tion of nutriment. The lacteal lies in the centre, and has connected with it the cells of the lymphoid tissue, which again lie in contact with the basement membrane, through which they are in immediate rela- tion with the epithelial cells. Through this channel the nutritive materials taken tiji by the epithelial cells are transmitted to the lacteal, though in what precise method has not yet been determined.

Lieberkiilin's follicles are minute tubules about 2V ^ ^^^^ length, somewhat like the gastric follicles, but smaller.

Solitary Glands. â€” These glands (glandulse soli- tarise) are called also, f'l'om the shajDe of their sac, lenti- cular and vesicular. In structure they consist of sphe- roidal masses of retiforin or lym- phoid tissue, the interstices of which are crowded with lymph cells ; each mass is surrounded by a very fine capil- lary plexus. The sacculi are em- bedded in the sub- stance of the mucous membrane, by which they are surrounded on all sides, and they form a prominence on the surface, which in the small intestine is studded with villi.

They are alsso found in the large intestine. Peyer's Glands or patches (glandulse agminatas) are confined to the jejunum and ileum, heiug larger and more numerous in tln^ lower part of the latter. To the naked eye they appear as oval patches on the mucous membrane, of about from one to three inches in length, and about an inch in breadth. They are paler in colour than the surrounding memlirane, and are somewhat raised ahoxc the general level. They run in the direction of the length of the intestine, and are generally found on the side opposite to the attached border. On more close inspection they are found to be formed of u collection of solitary glands in cloi^e proximity to each other ; hence their name, "aggregate glands." The sur- face mucous membrane in whicli they are embedded is free from villi, and the Lieberkiihn follicles are ar- ranged in circles around each nodule. The patches vary from twenty to forty in number. Vessels of the Mucous Coat.â€” The distribution of the finer arterial vessels and capillaries in the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal, in relation to the glands, is worthy of attention. The small arteries divide into fine capillaries in the submucous coat; these fine capil- laries enter the spaces between the tubular glands, and form l\y their communications a plexu.s around the glands, in their cour.si' to the surface. Ha"\dng reached the surface of the mucous mem- brane, the capillaries beconic increased in size, and form a horizontal plexus around the apertures of the glands, and these larger caj)illaries, taking a reti'O- grade course, unite to form small venous trunks, by which the blood is returned to the venous circulation. Hence the glands are provided for their secreting function with fine capillaries, while tlie capillaries which contribute to the nutrition and secretion of the surface of the mucous membrane are of a coarser kind. Vessels and Nerves of the Alimentary Canal.â€”The arteries of the alimentai'y canal, as they supply the tube from above down- wards, areâ€”the'pterygo-palatine, ascending pharyngeal, superior thyroid, and inferior thyroid, in the neck ; oesophageal in the thorax ; gastric, hepatic, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, in the abdomen ; and inferior mesenteric, internal iliac, and internal Fio. 447.â€”Vertical section of the in- testinal mucous membrane, bring- ing into view two Peyerian bodies. z.

The veins from the abdominal alimentary canal'unite to form the vena portse. The lymphatics and ladeals open into the thoracic duct. The nerves of the pharynx and oesophagus are derived from the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and sympathetic. The nerves of the stomach are the pneumogastric, and sympathetic branches from the solar plexus ; and those of the intestinal canal are the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. The extremity of the rectum is supplied by the inferior sacral nerves from the spinal cord. The nerves distributed to the small intestine form two plexuses, one between the longitudinal and circular muscular fibres, and the other in the submucous tissue : the former is described as Auer- bach's plexus (plexus myentericus); it gives off a number of minute filaments which ramify in the midst of the muscular fibres and are distributed to them: the latter is named Meissner's plexus ; it consists of fibres which are much finer than those of the inter- muscular plexus, and pass to the mucous membrane. Both plexuses are remarkable for the large number of minute ganglia Avhich they ( contain. LARGE INTESTINE. The large intestine, five or six feet and sometimes more in length, sacculated and thicker than tlie small intestine, tapers gradually from above downwards, and is divided into ccecum, colon, and rectum. It is distinguished from the small intestine by four character's, namely, its size, sacculation, the existence of three longitudinal bands, and the presence in connection with it of little fringes of fat called appendices epiploicce. The caecum (caput coli) is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, about two inches and a half in length, situated at the commencement of the large intestine. It is lodged in the right iliac fossa, and re- tained in its place by the peritoneum which passes round it and forms posteriorly a short meso-caecum. Attached to its extremity is the appendix vermiformis, a long worm-shaped tube, the rudiment of the lengthened ca3cum found in all maramiferous animals except man, the higher quadrumana, and the wombat. The appendix varies in length from one to five or six inches ; it is about equal in diameter to a goose-quill, and is connected with the posterior and left aspect of the caecum near the extremity of the ileum. It is usually more or less coiled upon itself, and retained in that coil by a falciform 1 duplicature of peritoneum. Its canal is extremely small, and the [ orifice by which it opens into the caecum not unfrequently provided with an incomplete valve. The caecum is the most dilated portion of the large intestine, and is distinguished from the colon externally by the constriction corresponding with the entrance of the ileum, and internally by the ileo-caecal or ileo-colic valve. The colon is divided into ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending colon passes upwards from the right iliac fossa,736 LAllGE INTES'l'INE. through the right himhar region to the under surface of the liver. It then hencls inwards and crosses the upper part of the umbiHcal region under the name of transverse colon; and on the h^ft side descends, descending colon, through the left luniljar region to the left iliac fossa, where it makes a remarkable curve uponitself, which is called the sigmoid flexure. The ascending colon, the most dilated portion of the large intestine, next the cic- cum, is retained in position in the abdo- men either by the pei i- toneum passing simply in front of it or by a narrow meso-colon. It is in relation in front with the small intes- tine and abdominal parietes ; behind witli the quadratus lumlio- rum muscle and right kidney; iiiternally with the small intestine and descending portion of the duodenum ; and by its upper extremity with the under surface of the liver and gall- bladder (hepatic flexure). The transverse colon, the longest portion of the large intestine, forms a curve across the cavity of the abdomen, the convexity of the curve looking forwards and sometimes downwards. It is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, gall-bladder, stomach, and lower extremity of the spleen ; by its lower surface, with the small intes- tine ; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and, by its posterior surface, 'snth the transverse meso-colon which connects it with the pancreas and duodenum. As it bends downwards to become descending colon it lies in contact with the lower end of the spleen (splenic flexure), and is connected with the inner surface of the ribs and diaijhragm by a peritoneal band (phreno-colic ligament). The transverse colon is the most movable ]mrt of the large intestine. The descending colon is smaller in calibre, and situated more deeply than the ascending colon. It is generally covered by peri- toneimi only in front, but in fully a third of the specimens examined there will be found a complete envelopment by peritoneum and consequent descending meso-colon. It is in relation in front with the Fiii. 449.â€”CiBcum and ileo-csecal valve, i. Ascending colon. 2. Ctecum. 3. Ilium. 4. Vermiform appendix. 5. Ilio-colic fold. 6. Ilio-ca;cal fold. 7. Frsenula. Â«KECTUM. 737 small intestines and great omentum, and beliind with the quadratus lumborum, left kidney and left cms of the diajDhragm. The sigmoid flexure, the narrowest j^art of the colon, curves upwards and to the right, then downwards and to the left, and is retained in its place by a sigmoid meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the small intestine and abdominal parietes ; and behind with the iliac fossa. Including the upper part of the rectum as far as the third sacral A'ertebra, it has been described by F. Treves as forming a lai'ge loop somewhat resembling the Greek letter Q, and he proposes the substitution of the title Omega loop for sigmoid flexitre. The rectum, the termination of the large intestine,'seven or eight inches in length, has received its name, not so much from the direc- tion of its course, as from the straightness of its form in comparison with the colon. It descends from opposite the left sacro-iliac sym^ physis, in front of the sacrum, forming a gentle curve to the right side, and then returning to the middle line ; oj)posite the extremity of the coccyx it curves backwards to terminate in the anus at about an inch in front of the apex of that bone. The rectum, therefore, forms a double flexure in its course, the one being directed from side to side, the other from before backwards. It is smaller in calibre at its upper part than tlie sigmoid flexure, Init becomes gradually larger as it descends, and its lower extremity, previously to its termina- tion at the anus, forms a dilatation of considerable but variable magnitiide. It is not sacculated like the colon, and has no separate longitudinal bands on it. With reference to its relations, the rectum is divided into three portions ; the first, including half its length, extends to about the middle of the sacrum, is completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the sacrum l)y means of the meso-rectum. This por- tion is in relation above Avith the left sacro-iliac symphysis ; and below, witli the branches of the internal iliac artery, sacral plexus of nerves and left ureter; one or two convolutions of the small intestine are interposed between the front of the rectum and the bladder in the male ; and between the rectum and the uterus with its appendages in the female. The second portion, about three inches in length, is closely attached to the surface of the sacrum, and is at fii'st covered by peritoneum on the front and sides, but lower down has that membrane only in front; it is in relation by its lower part with the base of the bladder, vesicula) seminales, and prostate gland ; and in the female with tlie vagina. The third portion curves backwards from op])osite tlie prostate gland and tip of the coccyx to terminate in the anus ; it is emln-aced by the levatores ani, and is about one inch and a half in length. It has no peritoneal covering, and is separated by tlie recto-vesical fascia from the piustate gland, vasa deferentia,' vesicular seminales and trigone of the Ijladder. This portion is separated from the mem- branous part of the urethra by a triangular' space ; in the female the triangular space intervenes between the vagina and rectum, and constitutes by its base the perineal l.)ody. Immediately above its 3 ALARGE INTESTINE. 738 termination tlie rectum undei'goes coiisideraljle enlargement, aiul bulges forwards, so as to give tlie anus tlie appearance of Ijeiug bent backwards ; tliis dilatation is called the sinus analis. The anus is situated at a little more than an inch in front of the extremity of the coccyx. The integument around it is covered with hairs, and is thrown into numerous radiated folds, which are obliterated during the passage of fa)ces. The anal passage or canal is described by Symington as connecting the anal aperture with the rectum ; it is from half an inch to an inch in length, and when closed has its lateral walls in contact with each other, so that the lumen has the form of a median slit. The margin of the anus is providefl with an abundance of sebaceous glands, and the epidermis may be seen terminating by a fringed and scalloped border, at a few lines above the extremity of the opening. Structure of the Large Intestine. The large bowel has the same coats as the small, namely, seroua, muscular, submucous and mucous. SEROUS COAT.â€”The peritoneum forms the serous coat; its arrangement in relation to the several parts of the colon has been described on a jn'evious page (p. 702). MUSCULAR COAT.â€”'I'his consists, as in the small intestine, of longitudinal and circular fibres. The longitudinal fibres commence at the appendix vermiformis, and are collected into three bands- anterior, broad ; and two narrower bands, one placed po.steriorly and the other laterally. The anterior band corresponds in the transverse colon to the line of attachment of the great omentum ; the posterior band is at the attached border of the colon ; and the lateral one lies on the inner aspect of the ascending and descending colon, and under surface of the transverse colon. These bands, the ligamenta coli, are nearly one-half shorter than the intestine, and serve to maintain the sacculated structure of the caecum and colon. In the descending colon the posterior bands usually unite and form a single band. In addition to these bands, the longitudinal fibres are also sparsely distributed over the surface of the sacculi. In the lower part of the' sigmoid flexure, the muscular fibres of the longitudinal bands begin to spread out, and in the rectum the fibres are regularly distributed throughout the entire calibre of the howel. The circular fibres are distributed over the whole surface of the colon, but are thickest in the sulci between the sacculi. In the caecum and colon they are very thin ; in the rectum they are thicker, and near its lower extremity are aggregated into the thick muscular band which is known as the internal sphincter ani. SUBMUCOUS COAT,â€”This coat in all respects corresponds to that in the small intestine. MUCOUS COAT.â€”In the caecum and colon the mucous membrane is smooth, and lines the surfaces of the folds which form the boundaries739 ILIO-C^CAL VALVE. of the sficculi of tlie large intestine. In the rectum it forms three valvular folds {valves of Houston), one of which is situated near the commencement of that part of the intestine ; the second, extend- ing from the side of the tube, is j^laced opposite the middle of the sacrum ; and the third, which is the largest and most constant, pro- jects from the anterior wall of the bowel opposite the prostate gland. Besides these folds, the membrane in the empty state of the intestine is thrown into longitudinal pleats somewhat similar to those of the oesophagus ; these have been named the columns of the rectum (colmnnce recti of Morgagni). The mucous membrane of the rectum is connected to the muscular coat by a loose areolar tissue, as in the oesophagus. One character serves infallibly to distinguish the mucous mem- l)rane of the small intestine from that of the large, namely, that the former is studded over throughout by minute conical processes called villi, which are entirely absent from tlie latter. The mucous membrane of the large intestine is furnished with Lieberklihn's follicles, resembling those of the small intestine ; they are, however, more numerous, are much longer, and contain a larger number of mucous-cells. The lymphoid tissue of the large bowel forms spherical masses, like those described in the structure of the small bowel under the name of solitary glands, but they are smallei' and less prominent. They are especially numerous in the cjecum and vermiform appendix. The epithelium on the surface of the large intestine is columnar, and the mucous membrane has on its deep aspect a definite muscularis mucoste. Ilio-caecal Valve.â€”At the termination of the ileum in the large intestine, the mucous membrane forms two semilunar folds, strengthened by the muscular coat. The termination of the ileuuv is oblique and flattened, and constitutes the division between the CEecum and colon, the two folds of mucous membrane being the ileo- ccecal or ileo-colic valve (valve of Bauhin or valve of Tulpius). The position of these folds is such that one belongs to the caecum, the other to the colon, the opening between them being oblong and oval, and not inaptly compared to a button-hole ; moreover, the colic flap somewhat overlaps the coecal fiap, and is so disposed in relation to the entrance of the ileum that the contents of the small bowel are necessarily discharged into the caecum. The upper or ileo-colic fold is horizontal in its direction, the lower or ileo-csecal is nearly ver- tical ; both folds are prolonged on each side for some distance beyond the ends of the opening, these prolongations being called frennla or relinucnla. The opening from the ileum to the ctecum is rounded and wide at its anterior and left end, narro>V and pointed at the posterior. Tlie description of the vessels and nerves distributed to the alimentary canal has l)een given with the anatomy of the small intestine.LIVER. 74Â° THE LIVER. The liver is the largest gland in the body, weighing ahout four pounds, and measuring through its longest diameter about twelve inches ; its breadth is commonly about six to seven inches, and its greatest thickness tliree and a half inches. It is situated in tlie right hypochondriac region, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondrium, fre(piently reaching, by its left ex- tremity, the iipj)er end of the spleen. It is placed obliquely in tlie abdomen ; its convex surface looking upwards and forwards, the concave downwards and backwards. The anterior Ijorder is sharj) and free, and marked by a deep notch, and the j)Osterior rounded and broad. His has pointed out that the liver when in the body has three surfaces, and not two, as usually described. The additional Fm. 450.â€”Upper surface of the liver, i. Right lobe. 2. Left lobe. 3.

The liver is in relation, superiorly and posteriorly, with the diaphragm ; mferiorly with the stomach, ascending ])ortion of tlie duodenum, transverse colon, right supra-renal l)ody, and right kidney ; and corresponds, by its free border, with the lower margin of the ribs. , ^ Ligaments â€”The liver is retained in its place by five ligaments, four of which are duplicatures of the ])eritoneum, situated on the convex surface of the organ ; the fifth is a fibrous cord which passes through a fossa in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava. They are theâ€” Falciform, Two lateral, Coronary, E-ound.741 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER. Tlie falciform ligament (broad or suspensory) is an antero- posterior fold of peritoneum, extending from tiie notcli in the anterior margin of the liver to its posterior border. Between its two layers, in the anterior and free margin, is the round ligament. It divides the upper surface of the liver into the right and left lobes. The coronary ligament is formed by the separation of the two layers of peritoneum which pass from the diaphragm to the liver. The posterior layer is continued luibroken from one lateral ligament to the other ; but the anterior quits the j)Osterior at each side, and is continuous with the corresponding layer of the falciform liga- ment. In tliis Avay a large oval surface on the posterior border of the liver is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the diaphragm by areolar tissue. I his space is formed principally by the right lateral ligament, and is pierced near its left extremity l)y the inferior vena cava, previously to the ^Dassage of that vessel through the tendinous opening in the diaphragm. The lateral ligaments are formed by the two layers of perito- neum which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior border of the liver ; they are lateral extensions of the coronary ligament. The round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the oblite- ration of the umbilical vein, and sitxiated between the two layers of peritoneum in the anterior border of the falciform ligament. It may be traced from the uuibilicus through the longitudinal fossa of the under surface of the liver to the inferior vena cavd, with which it is connected. Fissures.â€”The under surface of the liver is marked by five fissures, which divide its surface into five compartments or lobes, two principal and three minor lobes ; they are theâ€” Fissures. Lobes. Longitudinal fissure. Eight lobe, . Fissure for the ductus venosus, Left lobe. Transverse fissure, Lobus quadratus. Fissure for the gall-bladder, Lobus Spigelii, Fissure for the vena cava. Lobus caudatus. The longitudinal fissure is a deep groove running from the notch, umbilical fissure, in the anterior margin of the liver, to the posterior border of the organ. At about one-third from its posterior extremity it is joined by a short but deep fissure, the transverse, which meets it transversely from the under part of the right lobe. In front of this junction it lodges the filn-ous cord of tlie umbilical vein, and is generally crossed by a band of hepatic substance called the pons hejmtis. The fissure for the ductus venosus is the shorter portion of the longitudinal fissure, extending from the junctional termination of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and con-742 LIVEK. taiuiiig a small fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus venosus. This fissure is therefore but a part of the longitudinal fissure. The transverse or portal fissure is the short and deep fissure, about two inclies in length, through which the hepatic ducts quit and the hepatic artery and portal vein enter the liver. Hence tliis fissure was considered by the older anatomists as the gate of the liver, porta hepatisy and the large vein entering the organ at this point, was named the portal vein. At their entrance into the trans- verse fissure the branches of the hepatic duct are the most anterior, next those of the artery, and most posteriorly the portal vein. Be- sides these three structures, the nerves and lymphatics also enter the liver through this fissure. The fissure for the gall-bladder is a shallow depression extend- ing forwards, parallel with the longitudinal fissure, from the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the free border of the liver, where it frequently forms a notch, incisura vesicalis. The fissure for the vena cava is a deep and short fissure, occa- sionally a circular tunnel, which proceeds from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and'lodges the inferior vena cava. It lies between the Spigelian lobe and the right lobe, and has opening into it the hepa- tic veins, by which the blood leaves the liver. The relative position of these fissures, and the lobes which they limit, will be best understood from the subjoined scheme, for which we are indebted to Prof. D. J. Cunningham :â€” ( Posterior border ) Left lobe q3 C o Spigelian lobe Transverse fissure Quadrate lobe p.

It is marked on its under surface by the transverse fissure, and by the fissures for the gall-bladder and vena cava; and presents three depressions, one in front {impressio colica) for the curve of the ascending colon, and one behind (impressio renalis) for the right supra-renal capsule and kidney. On the imrer edge of the renal impression, a narrow and indistinct marking is generally present, being the part against which the ascending duodenum lies {impressio duoclmalis). The left lobe is small and flattened, convex on its upper surface and concave below, where it lies in contact with the anterior sur- face of the stomach.

The lobus quadratus is a quadrilateral lobe situated on the under siirface of the right lobe : it is bounded, in front, by the free border of the liver ; behind, by the transverse fissure ; to the right, by the gall-bladder ; and to the left, by the longitudinal fissure. The lobus Spigelii is a small triangular lobe, also situated on the under surface of the right lobe : it is bounded, m front, by the transverse fissure ; and, on the sides, by the fissures for the ductus venosus and vena cava.

Position of the Liver in relation to the Abdominal and Thoracic Wall.â€”The up]jer convex surface reaches as high as tht^ level of the fifth right chondro-sternal articulation ; the lowei- border corresponds pretty accurately to the inferior mai'gin of the cartilages of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs on the right side. The left lobe extends to about an inch to the left of the middle line, and lies against the anterior wall of the abdomen, its lower border bei]ig indicated by a line drawn from the ninth right to the eighth left costal cartilage. The gall-bladder has its fundus at the outer border of the rectus muscle, under the ninth right costal cartilage. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The vessels entering into the structure of the liver are also^(;e in number ; they are theâ€” Hepatic artery. Hepatic veins, Lymphatics. Portal vein. Hepatic ducts. The hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct enter the liver together at the transverse fissure, and ramify through portal canals to every part of the organ ; so that their general direction is from below upwards, and from the centre towards the circumference. The hepatic veins commence at the circumference, and proceed from before backwards, to open into the vena cava at the posterior border of the liver. The portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct are enveloped in a loose areolar tissue, the cajDSule of Glisson, which permits them to contract upon themselves when emptied of their contents ; the hepatic veins, on the contrary, are closely adherent by their walls to the substance of the liver in which they run, and are unable to contract. ' The former will consequently be found in any section more or less collapsed, and always accompanied by an artery and duct, and the latter widely open and solitary. The lymphatics of the liver are described in the section dedicated to those vessels. The nerves of the liver are derived from the sisinal and symi)a- thetic system ; the former proceed from the right phrenic and right Ijneumogastric nerve, the latter from the hepatic plexus. The liver is composed of lobules, of areolar tissue which connects them together, of the ramifications of the portal vein, hepatic duct, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves, and is enclosed and retained in its situation by the peritoneum. The serous coat, formed by the peritoneum, covers tlie whole surface of the liver, excepting' a ti-iangular area situated near the falciform ligaments. This coat is inseparable from the fibi-ous coat, or Glisson's capsule. The lohules are small granular bodies which vary in size from Minute Anatomy of the Liver.745 MINUTE STRUCTUKE OF THE LIVER. ff'jtli to i^th of an incli. When divided longitudinally, they have a foliated appearance, and transversely, a polygonal outline, with sharp or rounded angles, according to the smaller or greater quantity of areolar tissue contained in the liver. Each lobule is divided on its exterior into a base and a peripheral surface. The base corresponds with one extre- mity of the lobule, is flattened, and rests on an hepatic vein, which is thence named sublobular. The peri- pheral surface includes the rest of the surface of the lobule. In the centre of each lobule is a small vein, the intralobular, which is formed by the convergence of six or eight minute venules from the lobule. The intra- lobular vein thus constituted takes its course through the centre of the longitudinal Fig. 452.â€”Lobules of the liver.

Tlie interval between the lobules is the interlobular fissure, and the angular interstices formed by the apposition of several lobules are the interlobular spaces. In ultimate structure the lobule is composed of hepatic cells of a vascular plexus wldch receives its blood exteriorly from an interlolndar l)ranch of the portal vein and transmits it internally to the intralobular vein, the radicle of the hepatic vein, of stromal supporting tissue, and of the ultimate ramifications of the biliarv ducts. ^ The hepatic cells are nucleolo-nucleated cells, of a polyhedral figure, measuring about ^j^^ of an inch in diameter, and of a iDale amber colour. They have no distinct cell-wall, and when isolated possess the power of amceboid motion ; their contents are granular and often fatty vesicles of various sizes may be observed in theii' interior. The cells are arranged in a network correspondino- M'ithLIVER. 746 the vascuhu' plexus, the columns or solid portions of the network constituting the secretory ]iortion of tlie gland ; the vessels are not in absolute contact with the liepatic cells, but are separated from them by a membrane formed of flattened cells, the sjiace left between this membrane and the capillary wall forming a lympli cliannel. In order to imderstand the relations which the cells l>ear to the vessels and ducts, it will be necessary to trace the two latter from the transverse fissure to the interior of the liver, and to note their arrangement in the jjortal canals, around the lobules, and in the substance of the lobules. The portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct run to- gether in the interioi' of the li^'er, beiui: contained in channel - formed by a layer of connective tissue called Glisson's cap- side, the channels re- ceiving the name of portal canals; the hepatic veins run a totally independent course, and terminate in the inferior vena ca^ a, where it lies against the under and posterior part of the liver. Glisson's capsule is the areolar tissue which envelops the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, during their passage through the transverse fissure, and which continues to surround them in the interlobular fissures. It also constitutes the propei- capsule of the entire organ. Hence arises a division of the capsule into two portions, vaginal and inventing. The vaginal portion is that which invests the hepatic artery, hepatic duct, and portal vein, in the portal canals ; in the large canals it completely surroimds these vessels, but in the smaller i- situated only on that side which is occupied by the artery and duet. The investing jjortion is that which covers the exterior of the organ. The portal vein enters the liver at the transverse fissure, and ramifies throughout its structure in the ])ortal canals ; in the smaller canals Glisson's capsule only envelops the artery and duct, so that the portal vein is in direct contact with the lobules. The brandies of the portal vein areâ€”vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The vaginal branches are those which, being given off in the portal canals, have to pass through the sheath (vagina) of Glisson's capsule, previously to entering the interlobular spaces.

' the vaginal portal plexus where it exists, and directly from the portal veins, in that part of the smaller canals where the coats of the vein are in contact with tlie walls of the canal. They then enter the interlobular spaces and divide into branches, which cover with their ramifications every part of the surface of the lobules, with the748 LIVER. I exception of ilieir bases and those extremities of tlie suiK-i-ficiar lobules wliich appear on the surfaces of the liver. The lobular branches are derived from the interlobular veins ; they form a plexus within each lobule, and converge from the circumference towards the centre, where they terminate in the minute radicles oi the intralobular vein. This plexus, interposed between the iut<-i'- lobular portal veins and the intralobular hepatic vein, constitutes the venous part of the lobule, ajid is called the lobular venous plexus. The regular islets of the substance of the loljules, seen between the meshes of this jilexus by means of the microscope, are the network of hepatic cells. The portal vein returns the venous blood from the chylopoiclic viscera, to be circulated through the lobules ; it also receives the blood which results from the distribution of the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery enters the liver with the portal vein and hepatic duct, and ramifies with those vessels through the i)orfal canals. Its branches areâ€”vaginal, interlobular, and capsular. The vaginal branches, like those of the portal vein and hejiatic duct, form a vaginal plexus, which exists throughout the whole extent of the portal canals, with the exception of that side of the smaller canals which corresponds with the artery. The interlobular branches, arising from the vaginal plexus and from the parietal side of the artery (in the smaller canals), ramify through the inter- lobular fissures, and are principally distributed to the coats of the interlobular ducts. The capsular branches ramify within the capsule, accompanied by small veii;is. The hepatic veins commence in the substance of each lobule by minute venules, which receive the blood from the lobular venous plexus, and converge to form the intralobular vein. The intra- lobular vein passes through the central axis of the lobule, and through the middle of its base, to terminate in a sublobular vein; and the union of the sublol^ular veins constitutes the hepatic trunks, which open into the inferior A'ena cava. The hepatic trunks are formed by the union of the sublobular veins ; they have very thin walls and are in almost immediate contact with the lobules, even the larger veins being only separated by a small quantity of areolar tissue. They proceed from before backwards, and terminate, by two large openings (corresponding with the right and left lobe of the liver) and several smaller apertures, in the inferior vena cava. Biliary Capillaries and Ducts.â€”The biliary capillaries begin as minute jDassages between the sides of contiguous bile-cells, in Avhich no definite wall has hitherto been demonstrated. They apjiear to communicate by minute channels with vacuoles in the cells themselves. The bile capillaries form a fine i)lexus through- out the whole of the lobule, lobular plexus of ducts, and on reaching the circumference thereof, form a second plexus on its exterior, the interlobular plexus of ducts. From this plexus ducts are derived which run in the portal canals, being placed in each case on the same side as the hepatic artery, and surrounded749 MINUTE STKUCTUEE OF THE LIVEE. by C41isson's capsule ; they form fine plexuses in the portal canals, vaginal plexuses, and terminate by uniting to form the hepatic duct at the transverse fissure. The ducts m the interlobular plexus have definite walls formed by a basement membrane, lined by a sinc^le layer of flattened or cubical epithelial cells : the larger ducts have their mucous membrane supplied with a large number of tubular or flask-shaped mucous recesses, having much the appear- ance of mucous glands; these are arranged in two rows, one on each side of the vessel. The largest ducts have an outer coat of areolar and elastic tissue, a middle coat of longitudinal and circular Fig. 456.â€”Biliary capillaries from the rabbit's liver, i. Part of a lobule, a.

The right and left hepatic ducts unite to form the common hepatic duct, and this in turn is joined by a duct from the gall- bladder, the two together forming the common bile duct (ductus communis choledochus). The common bile duct runs in the free border of the lesser omentum, being placed to the right of the hepatic artery and in front of the portal vein. It passes behind the descending portion of the duodenum to the inner side of that intestine, where it terminates by passing obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat, and opening on the summit of a papilla which is common to it and the pancreatic duct. The papilla is situated near the lower part of the descending portion of the duodenum at its inner side ; and the duct is constricted in size during its passage between the coats of the intestine. Lymphatics and Nerves.â€”The lymphatic vessels accompany tlie IGALL-BLADDER. 750 portal vein tlirougli the portal canals and into the interlobular fissures ; they originate in the spaces described above as separating the capillaries from the biliary cells. There are also superficial lymphatic plexuses beneath the peritoneum, those on the upper convex surface communicating with the lymphatics of the dia- hragm and thorax. The nerves form the hepatic plexus, and are erived from the solar plexus and the left pneumogastric and right l^hrenic nerves. The branches entering the liver are very small ; they run with the arteries and ducts in the portal canals, those on the former having minute ganglia in their course. Some of the branches form an interlobular plexus, which gives twigs to the surface of the hepatic cells. Foetal Liver.â€”^The liver is one of the first formed abdominal organs in. the embryo, consisting primarily of two small masses of hypo-blastic origin, which grow out from the duodenum just beyond the stomach, and jDcnetrate the meso-blastic mass between those organs and the abdominal wall. The cells rapidly increase in number, those of hypo-blastic origin forming solid cylinders which ramify and anastomose with each other, and finally constitute the secretory portion of the gland ; the meso-blastic cells included within the network of the former constituting the areolar and vascular structure of the organ. Subsequently the solid cylinders are hollowed in their interior and form the biliary ducts. At the sixth week the liver fills the whole abdomen, and is one-half the weight of the entire embryo. At the fourth month the liver is of immense size in proportion to the bulk of the foetus. At birth it is of very large size, and occupies the whole upper part of the abdomen. The left lobe is as large as the right, and the falciform ligament corresponds with the middle line of the body. The liver diminishes rapidly after birth, probably from obliteration of the umbilical veiru GALL-BLADDER. | The gall-bladder (Fig. 457) is the reservoir of the bile ; it is a pyriform sac, situated in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and extending from the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the free margin. It is divided into a body, fundus, and neck ; the fundus or bi'oad extremity in the natural position of the liver is placed downiwards, and frequently projects beyond the free margin of the liver, while the neck, small and con- stricted, is directed upwards. The fundus comes in contact with the abdominal wall opposite the ninth costal cartilage of the right side. The gall-bladder is composed of three coats, serous, fibrous, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, is derived from the peritoneum, and covers that side only which is unattached to the liver. The middle or fibrous coat is a thin but strong fibrous layer, composed of dense areolar tissue, and connected on the one side with the liver, on the other with the peritoneum. There also exists in this layer a stratum of unstriped muscular fibres, which are longitudinal andPANCREAS. 751 circular in direction. The internal or mucous coat is but loosely attached to the fibrous layer ; it is everywhere raised into minute rugÂ£B, which give it a beautifully reti- culated appearance. It is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous membrane lining the ducts of the liver, and through the common bile duct, with the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. It is coated on its surface with a columnar epithelium. At the neck the gall-bladder becomes narrowed, much bent on itself, forming an S-like curve, and passes into the cystic duct; in the interior the reticular folds become modified so as to form seven or eight oblique ridges, liaving much the appear- ance'of a spiral valve, so as to check the outflow of the bile. These folds are called der. 2. Cystic duct. 3. valves of Heister. J'^^l^^ of Heister. 4^ Hepatic â€ž, . . , , 1 , . T 1 duct. 5. Common bile duct.

Vessels and Nerves.â€”The gall-bladder is supplied with blood liy the cystic artery, a branch of the hepatic. Its veins return their liiood into the portal vein. The nerves are derived from the hepatic plexus. THE PANCREAS. The pancreas is a long, flattened, conglomerate gland, analogous to the salivary glands. It is about six inches in length, and between three and four ounces in weight; is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the stomach, and rests on the aorta, portal vein, inferior vena cava, the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and the left kidney and supra-renal body, opposite the first lumbar vertebra. After the abdominal cavity has been laid open, the pancreas may be displayed in one of three ways :â€” (i) By cutting through the lesser omentum and drawing the stomach downwards ; (2) by cutting through the great omentum and dis- placing the stomach upwards ; and (3) by cutting through the trans- verse meso-colon. A glance at the diagram of the reflections of peritoneum (Fig. 409) will enable the student to understand how the pancreas is reached by each of these incisions. The pancreas is divided into a body, a greater and a smaller extremity ; the great end or head is placed towards the right, and surrounded by the curve of the duodenum ; the lesser end or tail extends to the left as far as the spleen. The anterior surface of the body of the pancreas is covered by the ascending posterior layer of peritoneum, and is in relation with the stomach, the first portion of the duodenum, and the commencement of the transverse arch of the752 PANCREAS. colon, llie posterior surface is grooved for the splenic vein ai.d tunnelled l,y a complete canal for tlie superior mesenteric and por!!.! veins, and superior mesenteric artery ; it is also in relation witli tl,- tei mination of the inferior mesenteric vein, left crus of the diaphragm and left supra-renal hody. The upper border presents a deep groove' sometimes a canal, for the splenic artery anh vein, and i.s in rela- tion with the oljlupie portion of the duodenum, lobus Spigelii, aixl ca>liac axis ; and the lower border is separated from the t?ansvei<,- portion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and ^â– eil, On the posterior part of the head of the pancreas is a lobular fohl ot the gland which completes the canal of the superior mesenteric vessels, and is called the h,sser pavcreas. The tail lies on the left kidne}, and its extremity is iii contact with the spleen. Tlie pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung) com- mences at the small ex- tremity of the organ Ijv the union of the ducts from the lobules; it is continued onwards from left to right, gradually increasing in size, to the lower part of the descend- ing duodenum, where it terminates on the ijapilla of mucous membrane, common to it and the common bile duct. The duct receives numerous branches M^iich open into it on all sides from the lobules of the gland, and at its termination is slightly dilated and passes obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat of the intestine to reach the j)apilla. The duct which receives the secretion from the lesser pancreas is called the ductus imncreaticus minor; it opens into the principal duct near the duodenum, and sometimes i^asses separately into that intestine. In structure the pancreas resents the ordinary composition of an acino-tubular gland, being made up of lobes, and these of reddish- yellow polyhedral lobules, which latter consist of smaller lobules, and the smallest lobules of the ramifications of minute ducts, ter- minating in tub alar aheoli. The alveoli are distinctly tubular, and sometimes are convoluted ; the cells lining them are columnar, and when the gland is at rest they completely fill the cavity and leave scarcely any lumen. They display an inner granular and an outer striated zoiie. In many parts tlie middle of the alveolus is occupied by spindle-shaped cells (centro-acinar cells).

In the walls of the ducts are numerous small racemose mucous glands like those in the hepatic ducts. The secretion of tlie pancreas is a clear fluid containing few cells. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the pancreas are branches of the splenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric ; the veins open into the splenic and superior mesenteric veins ; the lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are filaments of the solar plexus. THE SPLEEN. The spleen is an oblong flattened organ, of a dark bluish-red colour, situated in the left hypochondriac region. It is very variable in size and weight, but on an average is about five inches in length, and weighs six ounces; it is spongy and vascular in texture, and Fig. 459.â€”a. Trabecule of Spleen, b. An artery cut obliquely. exceedingly friable. The external surface is convex, the internal slightly concave, indented along the ]uiddle line, and pierced by several large and irregular openings for the entrance and exit of vessels ; this is the hiium Hems. The upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower, and rounded ; the inferior is flattened ; the posterior border is obtuse, the anterior shai'p, and marked by several notches. The spleen is in relation by its external or convex surface with the diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs ; by its concave surface, with the great end of the stomach, small extremity of the pancreas, gastro-splenic omentum with its vessels, left kidney and supra-renal body, and left crus of the diaphragm ; by its upper end with the diaphragm, and some- times with the extremity of the left lobe of the liver ; and, by its lower end, with the left extremity of the transverse arch of the colon. It is connected to the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum, and is supported by a fold of peritoneum passing from the diaphragm to the splenic flexure of the colon, and called the phreno-colic ligament or s\hspe7Lsorij Ivjament of the spleen. 3 B754 SPLEEN.

A second spleen (lien succenturiatus) is sometimes foinid appended to one of tlie l)ranclies of the splenic arteiy, near the great end of the stomacli ; when it exists, it is round and of small size, rarely larger than a hazel-nut. There ai'c sometimes two, and even three, of these bodies. Structure.â€”The sjileen is closely invested ]jy tlie peritoneum, excej)ting where that membrane is reflected on to the stomach and diaphragm, and at the hilus whei e the vessels and nerves enter it; this forms its outer or serous coat. Beneath this is the jn'oper capsule or tunica propria ; it is thicker than the serous coat, whitish in ajipearance, and very elastic. At tlie hilus the capsule is reflected into the interior of the organ along with the A'essels, forming strong bands or tra- beculas which radiate from tlie centre to the circuuiference, and conmiunicate with each other so as to form a mesh-work enclosing irregular spaces or areolae ; the fine external strands of the tra- beculse become connected with the interior of the capsule, binding it firmly and insepai'al)ly to the internal structure of the organ. Besides fibrous and elastic tissue these bands contain a few un- striped muscular fibres irregularly distriljuted. The interspaces or areolas thus formed are filled by a soft material of a reddish-brown colour, called the splenic pulp ; it consists of a fine reticulum of ramified connective-tissue corpuscles (supporting cells of the ]}'^''h^)-: ii^- ter.stices of which are occupied by blood, con- taining more than the usual proportion of A\'hite corpuscles. The cells of the reticulimi contfxin many pigment granules of a yellow or reddish colour ; these are probably derived from dis- integrated red blood corpuscles, and, indeed, it is not uncommon to find corpuscles in vai'ioiis stages of change in the ])rotoplasm of the sup- porting cells. Scattered throughout the spleen numerous light-coloured sjiots are observed, which, when of lai'ge size, present the apjiear- auce of sago grains ; they are the Malpigliian corpuscles of the spleen. They are closely connected with the outer coat of the small arterial twigs, sometimes being situated only on one side of the vessel (as .shown in Fig. 461), Init more commonly in the human subject completely surrounding Fic. 461.â€”Arterial twig of llie splenic artery, showing tlie connection of tlic splenic corpuscles with the small vessels.

In structure they correspond closely to the lymphoid masses described as forming the tonsils, the solitary and agminate glands of the intestine, and tlie lymph nodules of the lymphatic glands, bein"' composed of retiform tissue supporting innumerable round lymphoid cells. The cells of the retiform tissue are intimately connected with the supporting cells of tlie pulp. The outer coat of the smaller arteries is, throughout the whole of their ramifications in the spleen, converted into lyjnphoid tissue, so that the Malpighian corpuscles are but thicker aggregations of this tissue at certain parts of the course of the vessel. Arrangement of the Vessels of the Spleen.â€”The s'plenic artery is of very large size in proportion to the bulk of tlie spleen ; it is a division of the cceliac axis. The branches which enter tlie S23leen are distributed to dis- tinct sections of the organ, and anastomose very sparingly Avith each other ; they ter- minate in elegant bundles or pencilli of minute straight ar- teries, which end in capillaries. The latter, after running for a short distance, lose their tubular char- acter, and the cells which form their walls become branched and communicate freely with the branched cells of the SUJiporting ^^^^ lymphoid tissue of the Malpighian bcidy, reticulum of tlie pulp ; the contained blood comes thus to flow directly into the interstices of the lattei'. The vei7is commence in like manner by capillaries, the cells forming the walls of which are continuous Avith those of the pulp ; as we trace them outwards tliey assume the tubular character and anastomose freely witli each other in the meshes of the trabeculaj, thus dift'ering'from the arteries between which, in the sul)stance of the spleen, the anastomoses are few From tins description it will be seen that the arteries terminate and the veins commence in capillaries wliich are in direct communication with the pulp, so that the blood, in oi'der to pass from the one to the other, has to traverse it. There are, however, a few arterial canil lanes m tlie trabecule and capsule of the spleen which terminate in the veins in the usual manner. The lymphatics of the spleen are in two setsâ€”trabemlar and pcnvascular; the iormer run in the trabecula) and communicate Fig. 462.â€”Scclion of spleen, showing a .Malpighian body. b.

The supra-renal bodies or mpra-renal capsules are two small yellowish and flattened bodies surmounting the kidneys, and inclin- ing inwards towards the vertebral column. The riglit is somewhat three-cornered in shape, the left semilunar ; they are connected to the kidneys by the common investing areolar tissue, and each capsule is marked on its anterior surface by a fissure or hilum which appears to divide it into two lobes.

Each body is about one and three-quarter inches in height, an inch and a quarter in width, and from two to three lines in thickness ; they weigh from one to two drachms. Structure.â€” A section of a supra-renal body shows that it has externally a fibrous investment or capsule, and internally is divisible into two portions, that nearest the surface and forming the great bulk of the organ being firm, striated, and of a brownish-yellow colour ; this is the cortical portion. The central or medullary portion is of a brownisli-black colour, and so soft that many anatomists have erroneously supposed a cavity to exist in it. The cortical portion consists of a stroma supporting cells, the cells being arranged in groups, the largest and most imj^ortant of Avhicli assume the ajjpear- ance of columns. Arnold has divided the cortical jjortion into three layers. The outer he calls the zona glovierulosa; in it the cell groups are round or oval in shape. The next layer he names the zonco fasciculata; it is much the thickest of the three layers, and forms the bulk of the organ ; in it the cells are arranged in columns placed at right angles to the surface of the organ. Tlie thii-d layer of the cortex is a very narrow one called zona reticularis; here the stroma is equally distributed, and the cells are consequently not arranged in groups. The cells of the cortex are polyhedral in shape, and consist of granular protoplasm containing oil globules; each757 STRUCTURE OF THE SUPRA-RENAL BODIES. cell has a clear .spheroidal nucleus. The medullary portion is separated from the cortical by loose areolar tissue ; it is traversed by large veins, and is composed of a reticular stroma enclosing groups of cells which differ from those of the cortex in being coarsely granular, devoid of oil globules ^â– .,.^11^...^^, ^..^. ^â€” â€”- ' and many of them branched. The medulla is rich in nerves, and some observers have sup- posed the branched cells of this portion of the organ to be nerve cells, Luschka even stating that lie has traced nerve fibres in connection with them ; this statement is not confirmed by other observers. The blood-vessels of the supra-renal bodies are very numerous. The arteries, about twenty in number, proceed from the aorta, phrenic, cceliac, and renal trunks ; they enter the cortical substance at every point of its surface, the greater number dividing into minute twigs and forming a plexus in the cortical layer ; while others continue onwards to the me- dullary substance, and either terminate in the medullary plexus or cross the medullary substance to re-enter the corti- cal layer and contribute to the formation of its capillary plexus. The veins take their origin from the capillary i^lexus by minute venules, which unite to form the supra-renal vein. The supra- renal vein runs through the centre of the medullary sub- stance, and issues from the supra-renal body at the hilnm on its anterior surface, to terminate on the right side in the inferior vena cava, on the left in the renal vein. The lymphatic vessels are numerous, and belong to the exterior of the organ ; they terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are A'ery numerous, and derived from the renal and phrenic plexus, some filaments being received from the phrenic and vagus nerves ; Kijlliker counted as many as thirty-thi'ee trunks, composed of dark-ljordered nerve-fibi'es and provided with isolated Fio. 464.â€”Vertical section of snpra-reiial body.

They are distrilmted to the medullary suhstance onlv, in â– which they form a rich nervous plexus. THE KIDNEYS. Tlie kidneys, the secreting organs of the urine, are situated in the luniljar regions, behind the peritoneum, and at each side of the verte- bral column, corresponding to the bodies of the last dorsal and two upper luml)ar vertebra), and extending from the eleventh ril) to near the crest of the ilium ; they approach the vertebral column Ijy theii' upper end. Each kidney is between four and five inches in length, about two inches and a half in breadth, somewhat more than one incli in thickness, and weighs about 4^ oz. in the male and ratliei' less in the female. The kidneys are usually surrounded by fat; they rest on the crura of the diaphragm, on the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, which separates them from the cpiadratus lumborum, and on the psoas magnus. Tlie right kidney is somewhat lower than the left, from the position of the liver ; it is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the livei' and descending portion of the duodenum, which rests against it; and is covered in by the ascending colon. The left kidney, highei' than the right, is covered, in front, l^y the great end of the stomach, the spleen, tail of the pancreas, and descending colon. The anterior surface of the kidney is convex, the posterior is fiat; the superior extremity is larger than the inferior, and is in relation with the supra-renal ca]Dsule ; the convex border is turned outwards towards the parietes of the abdomen ; the concave border looks inwards towards the vertebral column, and presents a deep notch (hilum renale), which leads to a cavity, or sinus, within the organ. In the sinv,s rcnalis are situated the vessels and nerves of the kidney and the expansion of the excretory duct called the pelvis of the kidney. At the hilum these vessels are so placed that tlie renal vein is in front of the artery, and the pelvis and ureter behind. The kidney is surrounded by a thick layer of fat, contained in the meshes of a loose areolar tissue, forming the adipose capsule, and separating the kidney at the back from the diaphragm, ante- rior layer of the fascia lumborum, and ilio-hypogastric nerve ; and internally from the edge of the psoas. Within this, the organ is enclosed "in a fibrous capsule, which is thin, firm, and whitish, and composed of dense areolar tissue intermingled with elastic fibres, and lieneath this an incomjjlete layer of unstriped muscle. The capsule is connected by its inner surface with the substance of the gland by fine areolar tissue, but so loosely as to be easily separable. The substance of the kidney is dense and fragile, and when divided by a longitudinal incision, exliibits two structures, difiertnt ui colour and textureâ€”an external vasmlar or cortical fortion, and an internal tubular or medullary 'portion. The medullary portion consists of from eight to fifteen dark red conical nuisses, having their apices or papillae directed towards the pelvis, and their bases759 STKUCTURE OF THE KIDNEYS. these conical masses are the pyramids Fig. 465.â€”Section of the kidney, sur- nionnted by tlie .siipra-renal body ; the swellings on the surlace mark tlie original constitu- tion of the organ of lobes.

The pyramids are com- posed of an assem- blage of straight tubules, the tuhuli recti, which open into a shallow depression on the summit of the papilla, and divide into branches at acute angles as they proceed from the apex to the base of the pyramid ; these cause the radiate striation observable on a vertical section of the pyramids. The cortical portion, distinguished by its bright red colour, granu- hxr appearance, and softer texture, forms the surface of the organ, surrounding the base of each pyramid and penetrating between them to the sinus renalis. It therefore forms septa between the pyramids (sejoia vel columnce Bertini), and marks the original com- position of the kidney of separate lobes. It is com- posed of blood-vessels, with the cortical fasciculi and ultimate terminations of the tubuli uriniferi, liehl to- gether by a delicate stroma of areolar tissue. mi' Fio. 466.â€”Vertical section of kidney, u.

Tlie tubule, on issuing from the capsule, is constricted by a narrow neck, then -widens out and becomes convoluted, forming the first convoluted tubule; next it passes towards one of the pyramids of tlie medulla, becomingSTRUCTUKE OF THE KIDNEYS. 761 spiral as it descendsâ€”the spiral tubule of Schachowa. Entering the pyramid, the tubule becomes mnch narrower, and after a shorter or longer course bends on itself and again runs towards the cortex, becoming larger as it ascends, these two parts form the descending and ascending limb of the looped-tubule of Henle. On again entering the cortex, the uriniferous tubule becomes extremely irre- gular in outline, and is distinguished as the irregular tubule, and then again becoming convoluted forms the second convoluted tubule. The latter passes into a small junctional tubule, by which it is connected with one of the tubules in the Malpighian pyramids, called collecting tubulesâ€”these last uniting to form the excretory tubules already described as opening on to the apex of the papilla. The part of the pyramids near the cortex is called the boundary zone ; in it the tubules are collected into bundles, separated from each other by groups of small blood-vessels; and these, as they radiate from the pyramids into the cortex, form the medullary rays ; the cortical substance between and around their ends is called, on account of its intricacy, the labyrinth of the cortex. The Malijighian body, first convoluted tubule, irregular tubule, and second com^oluted tubule, are in the labyrinth ; the spiral and junctional tubule are in the medullary rays ; the descending and ascending limbs of the looped tubule of Henle, and the collecting tubules are in the boundary zone. The tubules are formed by a basement membrane supporting- epithelium ; they vary considerably in width in different jDarts of their course. Near the apex of the papilla the excreting tube measures from ^-J^ to of an inch ; the straight or collecting tubules are smaller, averaging of an inch ; the junctional and convoluted portions are about the same size as the straight tubules ; the looped tubules of Henle vary from joVo tÂ° T2W ^^<^1^ ! ^^'^^^ the Malpighian capsules are from to tt^q of an inch in width. Epithelium of the tubules.â€”The ej)ithelium of the excretory tubes is columnar, and the lumen is large in proportion to the depth of the cells ; that in the collecting tubules is cubical, but the cells vary considerably as regards regularity and thickness. In the junctional tubules the eiuthelium is cubical but somewhat fattened, and the lumen is relatively large. The second convoluted tubule (intercalary tubule) has an epithelium the cells of which are rather long, have a highly refractive proto- plasm and a large nucleus, and possess at their bases lateral pro- jections which dovetail into those of neighbouring cells. The irregular tubule is distinguished by the fact that, notwithstanding its irregularities in size and shape, the lumen is nearly the same throughout, this being brought about by the inequalities in the size of the cells ; their protoplasm appears to be made up of a series of minute rods, placed vertically to the surface of the basement membrane. A difference exists in the appearance presented by the ascending and descending limb of the looped tubules of Henle ; in762 KIDNEYS. Fro. the latter the lumen is distinct, and the cells form a flattened la> .â€¢> thickened hei'e and there by the presence of nuclei; in the fori'm i' the cells appro.xiinate in ^ character to those of tlic convoluted tulies, un'l although the whole tiihu is wider than the de- scending limb the luiiu ii is much narrower. In the spiral tube of Schachowa the lining cells are columnai', are firndy united by inter- locking processes, and have the part next tlie basement membrane apparently composed nf A'ertical rods; towards its termination, howeveT, the cells become shorter, less tibrillated, and split into ridges with furro\\-s between. The first con- voluted tube has an epi- thelium which corre- sponds in all essentials with that of the spiral tube. The neck of tlie Malpigliian capsule is lined with cubical epithelium, and in maii\' animals this is furnished with cilia ; but in the human kidney thev have not up to the present been demonstrated. The Malpighian bodies are found only in the cortical substanic of the kidney, and form the most distinctive feature of the structni e of the organ. Two vessels are connected with each Malpighian body, one entering it, afferent vessel, and the other leaving it, efferent vessel; the glomerulus and its vessels resemble in appearance fruif supported on its stalk. The capsiile is lined liy a flattened epithe- lium, which may also be traced on to the surface of the glomerulus, being most distinct in the latter situation where the caj^sule opens into the first convoluted tube. The epithelial cells in the capsnle are supported by a basement membrane formed of flattened epitlie- lial cells. Blood-vessels.â€”The renal artery, derived from the aorta, enleis the kidney between the vein and ureter, and di^â€¢ides into four or tiM^ large trunks which pass between the papillae to entei- that portion of the cortical substance placed between the pyramids of the medulla ; here they divide and subdivide, and give oil" small branches, wliii'h communicate across the bases of the pyramids so as to form imper- fect arches between the cortical and medullary substance.

In the Malpighian body the afferent artery divides into from five to eight branches, and each of tliese branches into a l)undle of capillaries ; they form a spherical vascular tuft, the glomerulus, and are againgatlierecl up into a single branch, the efferent vessel. T]je efferent vessel is smaller than the afferent; it tpiits the Fig. 469.â€”Plan of the renal circulation, o. Interlobular branch of tlie renal artery giving off several afferent ves- sels. I.

Malpighian body by the side of the latter and divides into capillary vessels, which form a rich plexus around the uriniferous tubules of the labyrinth, and eventually terminate in the renal veins. Those efferent vessels which are nearest to the base of the pyramids take a straight course(fti'imoZns rerffe)between the straight tubules, and giving off' bitt few branches in their course, also pass into a capillary plexus which surrounds the tubules and terminates in the venulce rectce. The renal artery also gives off branches to the capsule of the kidney which anastomose freely with branches of the lumbar arteries. The veins of the kidney commence at the surface by minute converging venules, the stellated vessels, in the corti- cal substance where they form the interlobular veins, and in the pyranuds of Mal]3ighi, where they constitute the venulae rectae; proceeding fi'om these three sources, they unite to form the l)ranches of Ihe renal vein, whicli termi- nates in the vena cava by a single large trunk at each side ; Fig. 470.â€”Transverse section through a Mal- pighian pyi-amid. o, a.

Tlie lymphatic vessels consist of a superficial set placed beneath tlie capsule, and of a deep set whicli accompanies the deep blood-vessels ; both sets terminate in tlic lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the renal plexus, which is formed partly by the solar plexus, and partly by the third splanchrui nerve. The renal plexus gives branches to the spermatic plexn>, and branches which accompany the ureters. Intertubular Stroma.â€”The tubules and vessels of the kidney are held together and supported by very fine connective tissue, that in the neighbourhood of the vessels and around the Malpighiaii bodies being fil^rous in its character. The stroma is more abundant in the cortical than in the medullary portion, and is there chiefly formed of connective-tissue corpuscles. The cavity of the kidney is occupied by a membranous bag. the pelvis renalis, which gives off three processes, the infundibula, one for each extremity'', and one for the middle of the organ; and the infundibula give off smaller pio- cesses termed calices, which em- brace the papillas and form a sepa- rate pouch around each ; the calyx being firmly attached to the base of the papilla and continuous with the fibrous capsule. Externally the sac Fio." 471.-TW0 varieties in the ar- of the pelvis renalis contracts into its raiigement of the pelvis and infnn- excretory duct, the ureter.

Tlie ureter (ovpeco, I pass water) is a membranous tube of about the diameter of a goose-quill, and nearly eighteen inches in length, continuous superioi'ly with the pelvis of the kidney, and con- stricted inferiorly, where it lies in an oblique direction between the muscular and mucous coat of the base of the bladder, and open on its mucous surface. Lying along the posterior wall of tl abdomen, it is situated behind the peritoneum, and is cimsed 1 the spermatic vessels ; in its course downwards it rests against tl anterior surface of the psoas, and crosses the comnjon iliac arter; and vein, and then the external iliac vessels. Within the pelvis i crosses the hypogastric cord and vas deferens in the male ; and runs by the side of the cervix uteri and upper ]Â«irt of the vagina in tlie female. There are sometimes two ureters to one kidney. The ureter, the pelvis, the infundibula, and the calices are com- posed of three coats, external or fibrous, middle or muscular, and le )y If â– y s itURINARY BLADDER. 765 internal or mucous. The fibrous coat consists of condensed areolar tissue, intermingled with fine elastic fibres. The muscular coat is made up of muscular fibres of the smooth kind, disposed in three layers, external and internal longitudinal, and a circular layer between. The muscular coat is thick in the ureter and j)elvis renalis, thin on the calices, and ceases altogether at the attachment of the latter to the papilljB. The mucous coat is thin, vascular, and without villi; on the paj^illfe it is connected with the substance of the pyramids, and is continuous with the uriniferous tubules, while inferiorly it becomes blended with the mucous membrane of the bladder. The epithelium of the mucons coat is thick, and com- posed of several layers of nucleated cells, which are small and round next the membrane ; of larger size and cylindrical or jjear-shaped in the middle; and large and cubical at the surface, sometimes measuring of an inch in breadth, and not unfrequently contain- ing two nuclei. Many of the superficial cubical cells are excavated on their under surface into little depressions, into which the heads of the pear-shaped cells of the middle layer fit. ^ PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is that portion of the great abdominal cavity which is included within the bones of the pelvis, below the level of the pectineal line and promontory of the sacrum. It is boimded by the cavity of the abdomen above, and by the perineum below ; its internal jiarietes are formed in front, below, and at the sides, by the peritoneum, pelvic fascia, levatores ani, and obturator internus muscles ; and behind, by the coccygei muscles, sacro-ischiatic ligaments, pyriformes muscles, sacral plexus of nerves, sacrum, and coccyx. The viscera of the pelvis in the male areâ€”the urinary bladder, prostate gland, vesiculse seminal es, and rectum. URINARY BLADDER. The bladder is a hollow membranous viscus, triangular and flattened against the pnbes when euipty, ovoid when distended, .situated behind the pubes and in front of and upon the rectum. It is larger in its vertical diameter than f roui side to side ; and its long axis is directed from above, obliquely downwards and backwards. Braune lias shown that in the erect posture the neck of the bladder is the lowest part of the viscus. It is divided into body, fundus, base, and neck. The body comprehends the middle zone of the organ; the summit or superior fundus, its upper segment; the base or inferior fundus, tlie lower broad extremity which rests on the rectum ; and the neck, the narrow constricted portion which is applied against the prostate gland.

The summit is connected with th abdominal wall by nieans of the urachus, and the neck is surrounded by the prostate gland. It is retained in position by ligaments which are divisible into true and false : the true ligaments are live in number, two anterior, two lateral, and the cord of the urachus ; tlie false ligaments are folds of the peritoneum, and are also five in number, two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The anterior ligaments (piiho-prostatic) are formed by the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, in its passage from the inner surface of th pubes at each side of the symphysis to the neck of the bladder and prostate gland. Between the two ligaments the dorsal vein of th penis runs. The lateral ligaments are also formed by the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, in its passage from the white line to the sides of the prostate gland and bladder. The ligament of the urachus is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the allantoic canal in the embryo. It proceeds from the summit of the bladder, and ascends along the linea alba to the umbilicus. The posterior false ligaments are the folds of peritoneum ]5as.?- ing from the rectum and sides of the sacrum to the bladder; the contain the ureters, and the vessels and nerves of the bladder. The lateral false ligaments are formed by the passage of th ])eritoneum from the side of the pelvis to the bladder; they cove the upper and posterior half of its lateral wall. The obliterate hypogastric artery lies along the line of reflection of the membrane. The superior or suspensory false ligament is the fold of peri toneum caused by the prominence of the cord of the urachus an the cords of the obliterated hypogastric arteries. Structure.â€”The bladder is composed of four coats, external or serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous. The serous or peritoneal coat covers the Avhole posterior surface of the bladder, and the under surface as far forwards as the entrance of the ureters, where it is attached to the back jiart of (he recto- vesical fascia. At the sides it is limited by the obliterated hypo- gastric arteries, and consequently only invests the upper and ])0ste- rior part; on the anterior surface it is entirely absent; abo\-e, it covers the part behind the urachus. The muscular coat consists of three layers of imstri]>ed muscular fibre ; external or longitudinal, middle or circulai-, and internal, which is also longitudinal. The external layer, or detrusor urinse, consists of parallel longitudinal fasciculi which take then- origin trom the anterior ligaments of the bladder, thence named tendons of the detrusor iirina); they spread out upon the upper surface ot tlieSTRUCTUEE OF THE BLADDER. 767 prostate gland and-ascend upon the anterior surface of tlie bladder to tlie fundus, where they are inserted into the subserous tissue, some being continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the posterior surface of the organ, and others prolonged upon tlie urachus. The longitudinal fasciculi of the posterior surface and sides of the l)ladder, attached superiorly to the subserous tissue, and partly continuous with those of the opposite aspect, while some are prolonged upon the urachus, are attached inferiorly to the prostate gland, those in the middle line being lost in the deep muscular layer of the neck of the bladder. The middle layer consists of circular fibres which are mo.st numerous at the cervix, where they form a moderately thick stratum, the sphincter vesicae, and are then continued onwards around the prostatic urethra. The internal layer ("submucous layer ; Ellis), thinner than the ]H-eceding, is composed of fibres which are oblicpie and scattered in the fundus and body of the bladder, but become longitudinal in its lower part and base, and are continued into the urethra. At the base of the bladder this layer is strength- ened b)^ the longitudinal fibres of the ureters. The three muscular layers comuiunicate â– with each other by means of a frequent inter- change of fasciculi. The areolar or submucous coat is the thick layer of areolar tissue interposed between the nuicous and nuiscular coat, and form- ing the bond of union betw^een them. The mucous coat is thick and smooth, of a pale-rose colour, and exactly moulded on the muscular coat, to which it is loosely con- nected by the subnmcous coat. When the l)ladder is empty it is thrown into folds or rnija;, excepting in the triangular ai-ea at the neck called the trigone. The mucous membrane is continiious through the ureters with the lining membrane of the pelvis of the kidney, and through the urethra with that of the seminiferous ducts, prostate gland, and Cowper's glands. It is provided with a stratified e|)ithelium similar to that of the ureters, the deeper cells of which are conical or fusiform ; the intermediate pyriforiu, and the superficial s^jheroidal or flattened, and of unequal size. It has a thin layer of nuiscularis mucosaj on its outer surface. The mucous membrane is rich in vessels, which are most abundant, as are the nerves, in the cervix and fundus ; the nerves are not numerous. On the internal surface of the base of the bladder is a triangular smootli plane, the trigonum vesicas or vesical trigone (Fig. 474), on which the mucous membrane is paler and thinner than the rest, and is not thrown into folds when the viscus is emi)ty. Calculi resting on this part give rise to nuich sufi'ering on account of the greater number of nerves distributed to the cervix vesica}. The tiigone is bounded at each side by the raised ridge, cori-esponding with the muscles of tlie ureters, at each ])osterior angle by the openings of the ureters, and, in front, by a slight elevation of tlie mucous membrane at the entrance of the urethra, called uvula vesica;.

The veins are numerous and of large size, and form a plexus around the neck and at the base of tlie bladder; the plexus communicates with the prostatic plexus and hfeinorrhoidal veins. The nerves of the bladder are derived from the inferior hypogastric plexuses and their communications with the third and fourth sacral nerves. They form a gangliated plexus on the blood- vessels, and also form a network under the epithelium.5j H (A Pk H Hi M M EH ft.

PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland (Trpota-TTjfii, to stand in front of) is situated in front of the neck of the bladder, behind the triangular ligament and pelvic fascia, and upon the rectum, through which latter it may be felt with the finger. It measures about one and a half inches across at its base, is about an inch and a quarter from base to apex, and its depth is nearly an inch ; it weighs from six di-achms to an ounce. It surrounds the commencement of the urethra for a little more than an inch of its extent, and resembles a Spanish chestnut both in size and form ; the base being directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder, the apex forwards, and the flattened side towards the rectum. It is retained firmly in position by the anterior and lateral ligaments of the bladder, and by a process of the pelvic fascia, which forms a sheath around it. It consists of three imperfectly defined lobes, two lateral and a middle lobe or isthmus ; the lateral lobes are distinguished by an indentation at the base of the gland, and a slight furrow on its upper and lower surface. The third lobe (prometria) is a small mass which passes between the two lateral Fig. 473.â€”Transverse section througla the middle of the prostate gland, u.

Structure.â€”It is covered by a thick and strong fibrous capsule, derived from the recto-vesical fascia behind and deep layer of the triangular ligament in front, and divisible into two layers, between which the prostatic plexus of veins is i^aced. Its proper structure IS composed of smooth muscle and glandular tissue, the latter being not more than one-third or one-fourth of the whole, and consisting of from thirty to fifty compound racemose glands, of a pyriform shape. Its secretion is poured into the prostatic portion of the urethra by fifteen or twenty excretory ducts. The ducts of the lateral lobes open into the urethra at each side of the veru mon- tenum ; those of the third lobe open upon and behind the veru The greater part of the prostate is formed of unstriped muscle mixed with white and yellow fibrous tissue ; the muscle fibres are many of them arranged circularly around the urethra, and are continuous with tliose ot the sphincter vesicfe ; others pass transversely across 3 c77P VESICUL^ SEMINALES. in front and behind the urethra, and radiate into the lateral loljes. The urethra, in passing through the prostate, lies one-third nearer its upper, than its lower, surface. The arteries of the prostate are small, and derived from the in- ferior vesical and middle hsemorrhoidal; they distribute numerous capillaries to the glandular structure of the organ. The veins form a rich plexus in the submucous tissue of the urethra, and anotlier of larger vessels on the exterior of the gland ; the latter receives from the front the veins of the penis, and terminates in the vesical plexus. Lymphatics are distributed with the veins betM'een the two layers of the capsule. VESICUL^ SEMINALES. On the under surface of the base of the bladder, and converging towards the base of the prostate gland, are two lobulated and some- what pyriform bodies, about two inches in length, the vesiculae â€¢.seminales. Their upper surface is in contact with the base of the bladder ; the under side rests on the rectum, sejDarated only by the I'ecto-vesical fascia ; the larger extremities are directed backwards and outwards, and the smaller ends almost meet at the base of the prostate.

The trian- gular area, bounded by the vasa defeventia and vesiculae seminales at either side, a dotted line above, and the figure 3 below, is the space cor- responding with the tri- gonum vesicae. The dotted line, forming the base of this triangular area, marks the limit of the rccto-vesical fold of peritoneum. by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, and corresponds with the trigonum vesiccE on the inte- rior of the bladder. Each vesicula is formed by the con- volutions of a single tube, wdiich gives off several irregulai' csecal sacculi and )ranches. It is en- closed in a thin fibrous memljrane, and is constricted beneath the isthmus of theprostategland, where it terminates in the ejaculatory duct. The vas deferens, somewhat enlarged and sacctilated, lies along the inner border of each vesicula, and is included in its fibrous investment; it unites with the vesicvda beneath the istlunus of the prostate, in the forma- tion of the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct is about three-quarters of an inch n\ length, and running forwards, first between the base of the prostate and the isthmus, and then through the tissue of the veru moutanum,771 PENIS. opens on the mncons membrane of tlie urethra, by the side of or within the aperture of the sinus pocularis. The vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia are j)artly covered by a muscular layer, compressor vesicuke et ductus seminalis (Ellis) ; which is brought into view on raising the recto-vesical fascia. This muscular layer consists of transverse and longitudinal fibres, the transverse fibres Ijeing tlie most superficial, and continuous with the posterior border of the prostate gland ; the longit udinal fibres lying in contact with the vesiculte and vasa deferentia. In structure the vesiculse seminales are composed of three coats : external, a thin fibrous membrane, made up of condensed areolar tissue ; middle, a muscular coat, consisting of smooth muscular fibres arranged in two layers, longitudinal and circular ; and inter- nal, a thin mucous membrane, vascular, marked by a delicate reticulation of ridges and alveoli, and coated with a squamous epi- thelium of cells containing yellowish pigment granules. Opening on to the surface of the mucous membrane are a large number of tubular glands, which give to its surface a brownish-yellow colour.

The , body is surrounded by a thin integument, which is remarkable for the looseness of its connection with the deeper parts of the organ, and for containing no adipose tissue. The root is broad, and firmly adherent to the rami of the pubes and ischium by means of two . strong processes, the crura, and connected to the symphysis pubis by an elastic fibrous membrane, the suspensory ligament. The extremity or glans penis resembles an obtuse cone, somewhat com- I jjressed from above downwards, and of a deeper red colour than the .surrounding skin. At its apex is a small vertical slit, the meatus urinarius, which is bounded hj two, more or less protuberant, labia ; and, extending backwards from the meatus, a grooved raj)he, to which a loose fold of nnicous membrane, the frsenum prseputii, is attached. Over the surface of the glans the integument takes on the characters of mucous membrane ; it is very intimately adherent to the tissue beneath it, is very vascular, and is covered with laro-e papillae, some of which contain vascular tufts and others nerve endings. Tlie base of the glans is marked by a projecting collar the corona glandis, in the groove beneath wliich {fossa glandis) are , placed tlie openings of numerous glands, the glandulae odoriferse772 MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. Tysoni. The integument around tlie base of the glans forms a loose fold, the prepuce, which, in the collapsed state of the organ, may- be drawn ovei' the glans, Init, in its distended state, is oljliteratecf, and serves to facilitate its enlargement. The internal surface of tin' prepuce is lined by mucous membrane, whicli, as above desci'ibed, is reflected over the glans, and, at the meatus urinarius, is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. The superficial fascia of the penis is thin, and its areolar struc- ture free from fat; it is continuous with the superficial fascia of tlie abdomen above, and with the dartos and superficial fascia of the perineum below. The suspensory ligament of the penis is an elastic fibrous mem- brane of triangular form, attached by its apex to the symphysis pubis ; and by its base, to the body of the penis. Near the latter attachment it separates into two layers, to give passage to the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis. The penis is composed of the corpus cavernosum and corpus spoyigiosum, and contains in its interior the longest portion of the urethra. The corpus cavernosum is distinguished into two lateral portions (corjiora cavernosa) by an imperfect septum and a superior and in- ferior groove, and is divided posteriorly into two crura. It is firmly adherent, by means of its crura, to the rami of the pubes and iscliium; and each crus, previously to its junction with its fellow, pre- sents a slight enlargement, wliich was named by Kobelt, the bulb. The corj^us cavernosum forms, anteriorly, a single rounded extremity, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans ; the superior groove lodges the dorsal vessels of the jDenis, and the inferior receives the corpus spongiosum. Its fibrous tunic is thick, elastic, and extremely firm, and sends a number of fibroiis bands and cords (trabeculse) inwards from the inferior groove, which, cross the interior in a radiating direc- tion, and are inserted into the inner walls of the tunic. These trabeculse are most abun- dant at the middle line, where they are ranged vertically, side by side, somewhat like the teeth of a comb, and constitute the imperfect partition of the corpus cavernosum, called septum pectiniforme. The septum is more complete at its posterior than towards its anterior part. The tunic of the corpus cavernosum consists of two layers of fibrous fasciculi. The external is longitudinal and forms a kind of close net by the frequent interchange ot fibrous bundles; it is common to the two corpora cavernosa. The internal, less thick, forms a circle around each lateral mass, and also constitxites the septum pectini- forme. From its anterior extremity it gives off small fibrous bands, t 1 ;{ Pio. 475.â€”Transverse sec- tion of the penis. i. Dorsal vein. 2. Dorsal artery. 3. Dorsal nerve. 4.

The fibres of the fibrous coat penetrate into the interior, and there form the trabemlce of the cavernous erectile tissue. The corpus spongiosum is situated along the under surface of the corpus cavernosum, in its inferior groove. It commences by its posterior extremity between and beneath the crura penis, where it forms an enlargement, the bulb, and terminates anteriorly by another expansion, the glans penis. Its middle portion, or body, is nearly cylindrical, and tapers gradually from the posterior to the anterior extremity. The bulb is adherent to the triangular liga- ment by means of a prolongation of fibrous membrane ; in the rest of its extent the corpus spongiosum is attached to the corpus caver- nosum by areolar tissue, and by veins which pass upwards to reach the dorsal vein. It is composed of erectile tissue, enclosed in a dense fibroiis layer much thinner than that of the corj)US caver- nosum, and contains the sj)ongy portion of the urethra, which lies nearer its upper than its lower wall. The bulb shows a tendency to division into two lobes, an appearance which is due to the existence of a thin longitudinal septum in its interior. The fibrous tunic of the corpus spongiosum, unlike that of the corpus cavernosum, consists only of circular fibres which are re- flected inwards along the middle line, forming a septum which is complete only in the bulb ; the reflected fibres of this sejDtum em- brace the urethra through its entire length, and exclude the latter from the proper structure of the corpus spongiosum. Erectile tissue is a peculiar cellulo-vascular structure, entering in considerable qiiantity into the composition of the organs of genera- tion. It consists of bands of fibrous and elastic tissue (with a few muscular fibres) which pass from the capsule of the oi'gan into its interior, and there divide and unite in such a manner as to produce a system of cavities communicating freely with each other. The cavities are smaller in the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and cir- cumference of the corpus cavernosum than in the central part of the latter, where they are large and dilated ; they are lined by a layer of flattened endothelial cells, continuous with those lining tlie arteries and veins. The cavernous spaces are at all times filled with blood, but become overcharged and distended during erection of the organ, in consequence of pressure upon its large veins retarding the venous flow. The arteries are convoluted in the passive state of the penis, but straightened in its distended condition ; they terminate in large capillaries, which do not form a plexus, as in other situations, but open directly into the cavernous spaces. Some of the finer twigs of the arteries have a peculiar, twisted, and dilated or tendril-like appearance, first described by Miiller under the name of arterice helicince. The helicine arteries are somewhat dilated where they lie in the trabeculiB, and are bound down by small fibrous bands, possibly for the purpose of limiting their distension. The venous plexus conveys the blood into the efl'erent veins of the penis, bv which it is returned to the general circulation.MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 774 Vessels and Nervesâ€”Tlie arteries of thepenis are derivedfrom the uiterixal jiudic ; tliey areâ€”tlie arteries of tlie bulb, arteries of tlie cor- ^ ]His cavernosum, and Its m?is are superficial and deep. The deep veins run by the side of the deep arteries, and tei-minate in the internal pudic veins. The superficial veins escape in considerable numl)er fi'oni the base- of the glans, and con- verge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which re- ceives otlier A'eins from the corpus caA-ernosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the liga- mentum suspensorium, and tlirougli the tri- angular ligament be- neath the arch of the pubes, to terminate in the prostatic plexus. The Ijrmphatics ter- minate in the upper grou]3 of inguinal glands, while some of the dee2)er lymphatics lake the course of the urethra and end in the pelvic glands. The nerves are derived from the pudic nerve, sacral j)lexus, and hypogastric plexus. Fig. 476.â€”Structure of the peripheral portion of the corpus cavernosum penis, i, a, a. Superficial net- work, h.

The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus uriuarius. It is curved in its course, and composed of three layers, a mucous coat, submucous coat, and muscular coat. The mucous coat is thin and smootli ; it is con- tinuous internally with the mucous membrane of the bladder ; externally, with the investing membrane of the glans; and at certain points of its extent, with the lining uieuibrane of the numerous ducts which open into the urethra, namely, those ofUKETHEA. 775 Cowper's glands, prostate gland, vasa deferentia, and yesiculte seniinales. It is provided with a stratified squamous epithelium corresponding with that of the bladder, and has opening on to its surface numerous mucous recesses or crypts, and the ducts of the glands lying in the submucous tissue. The submucous coat is loose, and contains a convoluted vascular structure resembling erec- tile tissue ; it also contains numei'ous racemose mucous glands, which 21 Fig. 477.â€”Longitudinal section of the bladder, prostate gland, and penis, showing the urethra, i.

The glands are mo.st abundant along the floor of the urethra, espe- cially in the bulbous portion. The muscular coat consists of unstriped muscular fibres, the outer layer of wliich is arranged circularly and is continuous with the circular muscular layer of the bladder ; the inner layer is longitudinal. The urethra is about eight inches in length, and divided into a prostatic, membranous, and spongij portion.776 MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. _ Tlie prostatic portion, about one and a quai-ter inches in lenetli IS situated in tlie prostate gland, about oue-tliird nearer its upijer than Its lower surface, aiul extending from its base to its apex. It IS the widest part of the urethral canal; and measures about one-third ot an indi at the neck of the bladder, and nearly half an inch in the middle of the prostate ; it tlien narrows to aljout one quarter inch as it passes into the membranous poi'tion. On its Hoor is a longitu- dinal ridge, the veru montanum, or caput gallinaginis; and at Fig. 478.â€”The bul- j bous, membran- / 2 ous, and prostatic urethra, with part of the bladder, laid open from above.

The veru montanum is most prominent in the centre ; and im- mediately in front of the prominent part is the opening of a small csecal sac, the sinus pocularis, or vesicula prostatica {uterus ina<;- culinus). This sac is the hoinologue of the utei'us ; it is nearly half an inch in length, extends Ijack beneath the third lol)e of the pros- tate, and by its apj)roacli to the surface contributes to the prominence777 URETHEA. of the veru montanum. Its walls, of a yellowish-white colour, are composed of areolar and elastic tissue, mingled towards its fundus Avith unstriped muscular fibre, and it is lined within by a laminated epithelium, the surface layer being formed of flattened cells. The ejaculatory ducts take their course forward in the walls of the sinus pocularis, and terminate close to its aperture by slit-like open- ings. The veru montanum contains erectile and muscular tissue, and it is believed that its distension may prevent the semen passing I back into the bladder during emission. The membranous portion is the narrowest and most fixed part of the canal; it measures about one-fifth of an inch in diameter, and â–  is about three-quarters of an inch in length along its lower wall, i and half an inch on its upper. It extends from the apex of the pros- i tate gland to the bulb of the corpus sioongiosum, and passes through I the triangular ligament. Its coats areâ€”the mucous membrane, cir- j cular muscular coat, and compressor urethrse muscle. The sub- 1 mucouÂ§ tissue is richly supplied Avith vessels, and much resembles ! erectile tissue. The spongy portion, about six inclies in length, forms the rest of the extent of the canal, and is lodged in the corpus spongiosum I from its commencement at the triangular ligament to the meatus urinarius. It is narrowest in the body, and dilated at each ex- tremity, posteriorly in the bulb, where it is named the bulbous portion, and anteriorlj'- in the glans penis, where it forms the fossa navicularis. The meatus urinarius is the most constricted part of the canal; so that a catheter, which will enter that opening, may be passed freely through the whole extent of a normal urethra, i Opening into the bulbous jjortion are two small excretory ducts about an inch in length, which may be traced backwards, between I the coats of the urethra and the bulb, to the under part of the mem- i branous portion behind the triangular ligament, where they originate ' in two small, lobulated, and somewhat compressed glands, of about I the size of peas, Cowper s glands. These glands are enclosed in a thin capsule, their glandular structure being held together by areolar tissue and smooth muscular fibre ; smooth muscular fibre ; is also found as a longitudinal layer, around their excretory ducts. They are situated immediately beneath the membranous "portion ! of the urethra, and are enclosed by the lower segment of the I compressor urethrse muscle, so as to be subject to muscular com- pression. On the whole internal surface of the spongy portion of i the uretlira, and especially along its lower surface, are numerous I small openings of lacuuDe, and the apertures of mucous glands i situated in the submucous areolar tissue (glands of Littre). The openings of the lacunae are directed forwards, and are liable occa- i sionally to intercept the point of a small catheter in its passage to the 1j1 adder. At about an inch and a half from the opening of the meatus, in the upper wall of the urethra, one of the lacuna) is generally found much larger than tlie rest, and is named the lacuna magna.778 MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The urethral canal is closed, excej^t during the passage of uiinc or semen, the closure resulting in the mucous membrane bein- tlirown into longitudinal folds ; the lumen in tliis condition foriji> a transverse slit, but at the meatus the slit is vertical. TESTICLES. The testicles are two small glandular organs suspended from the abdomen by the spermatic cords, and enclosed in an external tegu- inentaiy covering, the scrotum. The SCROTUM is distinguished into two lateral halves or hemi- spheres by a raph^, which is continued anteriorly along tlie nndci surface of the penis, and ])osteriorly along the middle line of tlic perineum to the anus. Of these two lateral portions the left is somewhat longer than the right, and corresponds with the greatei' length of the spermatic cord on the left side. The scrotum is composed of two layers, integument, and a pro])er covering, the dartos : the integument is thin, devoid of fat, semi- transparent, possesses numerous large sebaceous and sudori2)arous glands, is beset witli hairs which issue obliquely from the skin, and have prominent roots, and has usually a dark colour from the presence of pigment in the epidermis. The tunica dartos is a thin I'eddish layer composed of unstriped muscular tissue; it forms tlie proper tunic of the scrotum, and sends inwards a sejitura, septum scroti, which divides the cavity into two sacs for the two tes- ticles. The dartos is continuous around the base of the scrotum with the common superficial fascia of the abdomen and perineum, and in an attenuated form is prolonged upon the penis to the prepuce. The SPERMATIC CORD is the medium of communication between the testicle and the interior of the al)domen; and is composed of arteries, veins, lymphatics, nerves, tlie exci-etory duct of the testicle, and investing tunics. It commences at the internal alxlominal ring, where the vessels of A\diich it is composed converge, and passes obliquely along the spermatic canal; the cord then escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends through the scrotum to the posterior border of the testicle. The left cord is somewhat longer than tlie right, and permits the left testicle to reach a lower level than its fellow. The arteries of the spermatic cord areâ€”the spermatic artery from the aorta; the deferential artery, accompanying the vas deferens, from the superior vesical; and the cremasteric, from the epigastric artery. The spermatic veins form a plexus which constitutes the chief bulk of the cord ; they are provided with valves at short in- tervals, and the smaller veins haA^e a peculiar tendril-like arrange- ment, which has obtained for them the name of pampiniform plexus (spermatic plexus). The lymphatics are of large size, and terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus of the sympathetic, whicli is derived from the aortic and renal plexus, tlieTESTICLES. 779 genital braiicli of the genito-crural nerve, and tlie inguinal branch of the ilio-inguinal. The vas deferens, the excretory duct of the testicle, is situated along the posterior border of the cord, where it may be distin- . guislied by the hard and cordy sensation which it communicates to the fingers. It is about a line or a line and a half in thickness ; its parietes are thick and tough, and its canal from one-fourth to one-third the diameter of the entire duct. In structure it is com- posed of three coatsâ€”an external or fibrous coat, Avhich is thin; a middle or muscular coat, which is reinarkable for its thickness, and consists of three layers of smooth muscular fibre, namely, ex- ternal longitudinal, middle circular, and internal longitudinal; and an internal or mucous coat, the mucous membrane being -pale in colour, disposed in longitudinal pleats, and coated with a columnar epithelium, composed of cells containing yellowish pigment granules. In the dilated portion, near its termination (amiJuUa), it presents a reticular appearance, like that of the vesiculte seminales. The coverings of the spermatic cord areâ€”the spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle, and fascia propria. The spermatic fascia is a j)rolongation of the intercolumnar fascia, deriA'ed from the borders of the external abdominal ring during the descent of the testicle in the foetus. The cremasteric covering, erythroid, is the thin mus- cular expansion formed by the spreading out of the fibres of the cremaster, which is likewise carried down by the testicle during its descent. The fascia propria is a continuation of the infundibuliform process from the transversalis fascia, which immediately invests the vessels of the cord, and is also obtained during the descent of the testicle. The TESTICLE is a small oblong and rounded gland, about an inch and a half in length, somewliat comj)ressed at the sides and behind, and suspended in the cavity of the scrotum by the spermatic cord. Its position in the scrotum is oblique, so that the upper extremity is directed upwards and forwards, and a little outwards ; the lower, downwards and backwards, and a little inwards ; the convex border looks forwards and downwards, and the flattened border to which the cord is attached, backwards and ujnvards. Lying against its outer and posterior border is a flattened body which follows the course of the testicle, and extends from its upper to its lower ex- tremity ; this body is named, from its relation to the testis, epi- did37inis (eVt, upon ; St'Su/xo?, the testicle); it is divided into a central part or body, an upper extremity, head or globus major, and a lower extreinity, tail or globus minor. The globus major is situated against the upper end of the testicle, to which it is closely adherent; the globus minor is placed at its lower end, is attached to the testicle by areolar tissue, and curves upwards, to become continuous with the vas deferens. Tlie testicle is invested by three tunicsâ€”tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica" vasculosa, and is connected to the inner surface of the dartos by a large quantity of extremely loose areolar tissue,78o MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. ill whicli fat is never deposited, ljut wliich is very susceptible of serous mhlti-ation. i v. ui The tunica vaginalis is a pouch of serous membrane derived Irom tJie mritoneuiu in tlie descent of tlie testicle, and afterwards obliterated irom the abdomen to within a short distance of the gland. It IS a shut sac, investing the organ, visceral portion, and tiien reflected so as to form a bag around its circumference, parietal portion On the outer side it forms a shallow pouch called diaital Jossa, between the testicle and the body of the epididymis. The visceral portion, tunica vaginalis propria, covers the surface of the tunica albugmea, and surrounds the epididymis, connecting it to the testicle by means of a duplicature. The parietal portion, tunica vaginalis communis, is attaclied by its external surface, through the medium of a quantity of loose areolar tissue, to the inner surface of Fig. 479.â€”Transverse section of the testicle.

Between the two layers is the smooth surface of the shut sac, moistened by its secretion. At the upper part of the testicle and in front of the globus major of the epididymis one or two small pedunculated bodies are commonly observed ; they are described as the hydatids of Morgagni, and are composed of connective tissue and blood-vessels with a covering of tunica vaginalis. The largest of these is regarded as the remains of a foetal structure called the duct of Mtiller. The tunica albuginea is a thick areolo-fibrous membrane, of a bluish-white colour, and the proper tunic of the testicle. It is adherent externally to the tunica vaginalis propria, and, from the union of a serous with a fibrous membrane, is regarded as a fibro- serous membrane, like the dura mater and pericardium. After surrounding the testicle, the tunica albuginea is reflected from its posterior border into tlie interior of the gland, and forms a project- ing longitudinal ridge, the mediastinum testis (corpus Highmori- anum), from which numerous fibrous coi'ds (trabecular septula) are given ofl", to be inserted into the inner surface of the tunic. Tlie mediastinum contains the blood-vessels and ducts in their passage781 TESTICLES. into the substance of tlie organ. If a transverse section of the testicle be made, and the surface of the mediastinum examined, it will be observed that the blood-vessels of the substance of the organ are situated near the posterior border of the mediastinum, while the divided ducts of the rete testis occupy a place nearer the anterior margin. The whole internal surface of the tunica albuginea is covered by a plexus of minute blood-vessels, which also extends on to the septa derived from the mediastinum ; this layer is sometimes described as the tunica vasculosa. The substance of the testicle consists of numerous conical flattened lobules, the bases being directed towards the surface of the organ, and the apices towards the mediastinum. Krause found between four and five hundred of these lobules in a single testicle. Each lobule is invested by a distinct sheath formed of two layers, one being derived from the tiinica vasculosa, the other from tlie tunica albxiginea. The lobule is comj)osed of from one to three minute tubuli, tubuli seminiferi,* exceedingly con- voluted, anastomosing fre- quently with each other near their extremities, terminating in loops or in free csecal ends, and of the same diameter, of an inch (Lauth), through- out. The tubuli seminiferi become less convoluted in the apices of the lobules, and ter- minate by forming between twenty and thirty small straight ducts of about twice the diameter of the tubuli seminiferi, the vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the substance of the medias- tinum, and terminate m Fig. 480. â€” Ana- tomy of the testicle, i, i. Tunica albu- ginea. 2, 2. Me- diastinum tes- tis. 3, 3.

At the upper extremity of the medias- tinum, the ducts of the rete testis terminate in from nine to thirty sniall ducts, the vasa efferentia,+ which form by their convolu- tions a series of conical masses, the coni â– vasculosi; from the bases o f^l'^*"^ estimates the whole number of tubuli seminiferi in each testicle at 840 r"^*^-3 inches.

The entire length of the tubes composii.g the epididymis, according to the same authority, is about 21 feet782 MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. ol these cones tubes of larger size proceed, which constitute, by their complex convolutions, the body of tlie epididymis. The tube, become gradually larger towards the lower end of the epididymis, aii<l ternunate in a single large and convoluted duct, the vas deferens. The walls of the seminal tuljules are formed of a basement mem- brane, consisting of several layers of flattened epithelial cells. Th- tubes are occupied by cells, which are in some ])laces situated at thi- circumference on]}, a small lumen oi cavity being left in the centre ; but in the adult testicle the\ generally form a con- fused mass filling uj) the entire tube. In many cases there is n pretty definite layei' of cubical or flat- tened cells next tin- basement membrane, and these have been named the outer or lining cells. Tlie cell - placed internally to these are large and clear ; the ajipear- ance of their nuclei indicates that they are proliferating, and they have accord- ingly been named the intermediate or proliferating cells. Within these, again, the cells ai'e united to form an almost indistinguishable mass, in which the heads of the spermatazoa are imbedded, the tails being free in tlie lumen of the tube (innermost or nutritive cells). Between the tubes the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves ramify ; they are supported by a peculiar tissue containing a large quantity of nuclear and molecular elements, and in Avhicli there are lacunar spaces lined by a flattened eijithelium, these sjjaces being the radicles of the lymphatics. The epididymis is formed by the convolutions of the excretory seminal ducts, externally to the testis, and previously to theii' termination in the vas deferens. The more numerous convolutions and the aggregation of the coni vasculosi at tlie upper end of the organ constitute the globus major ; the continuation of the convo- lutions downwards is the body ; and the smaller number of con- volutions of the single tube at the lower extremity, tlie globus minor. The tubuli are connected together by filamentous ai'eolar tissue, and bands of fibrous tissue. Fio. 481.â€”Section of the tubuli seminiferi of a rat. a.

Scliiifer.)TESTICLES. 783 A small convoluted duct, of variable length, is generally con- nected with the duct of the epididymis, just at the commencement of the vas deferens. This is the vasculum aberrans of Haller ; it -is attached to the epididymis by the areolar tissue in which that body is enveloped. Sometimes it becomes dilated towards its extremity, but more frequently retains the same diameter through- out. The rete testis is lined by a single layer of squamous cells. The lining cells of the vasa efferentia and upper part of the epididymis are columnar or prismatic in form, and are ciliated ; in the lower part of the epididymis the cilia disappear. The walls of these canals are of considerable thickness, and contain unstriped muscular fibre arranged for the most part in a circular manner. In front of the spermatic cord, and in contact with the globus major of the epididymis, is a minute irregular structure, which, on â€¢microscopic examination, is found to be tubular. It is the remains of the Wolffian body, and is called the parepididymis or organ of - Giraldes. The vas deferens may be traced upwards, from the globus minor of the epididymis along the posterior part of the spermatic cord, and along the spermatic canal to the internal abdominal ring. From the ring it is reflected inwards to the side of the fundus of the bladder, and descends along its posterior surface, crossing the ureter, to the inner border of the vesicula seminalis. In the latter situation it becomes somewhat larger in size and sacculated (forming an ampulla), and terminates at the base of the prostate gland, by uniting with the duct of the vesicula seminalis, and constituting the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct, which is thus formed by the junction of the duct of the vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens, passes forwards in the outer wall of the sinus pocularis, and terminates by a slit-like opening by the side of the aperture of the " sinus. The TESTICLES IN THE EMBRYO are situated in the lumbar regions, immediately in front of and somewhat below the Icidneys. They have, connected with them inferiorly, a peculiar structure, which assists in their descent, and is called the gubernaculum testis. The gubernaculum is a soft and conical cord, composed of areolar tissue, containing in its areolae a gelatiniform fluid. In the abdomen it lies in front of the psoas muscle, and passes along the spermatic canal, which it serves to distend for the passage of the testis. It is attached by its superior and larger exti'emity to the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and by the inferior extremity to the bottom of the scrotum. The gubernaculum is surrounded hj a thin layer of muscular fibres, the cremaster, which passes upwards upon this body to be attached to the testis. Inferiorly the muscular fibres divide into three processes, which are thus attached : the external and broadest is connected to Poupart's ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle forms a lengthened band, which escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends to the bottom of the784 DESCENT OF THE TESTICLE. scrotum, where it joins the dartos ; the internal passes in the direc- tion inwards, and has a firm attachment to the os pubis and slieath ot the rectus muscle. Besides these a number of muscular filjres are reflected from the internal ol)lifiue on the front of the tniberiia- culum. Â° .1 '^i? descent of the testicle is gradual and progressive. Between the htth and sixth uionth it has reached the lower part of the psoa.s muscle, and, during the seventh, makes its way through the spermatic canal, and descends into the scrotum. While situated in the lumbar region, the testicle and gubernaculum are placed behind the peritoneum by which they are invested upon their anterior surface and sides, forming a mesorchium. As they ' Pia. 482. â€”Diagram illustrating the descent of the tes- ticle. I. Testicle. 2. Epididymis. 3, 3.

The upper part of this jDouch, being compressed by the sjjermatic canal, is gradually obliterated, the obliteration extending downwards along the spermatic cord nearly to the testicle. That portion of tlie peritoneum immediately surrounding the testicle is, by the abo-\ e process, cut off from its continuity with the jDeritoneum, and is termed the tunica vaginalis. In its descent the testicle receives cer- tain structures from the different layers of the abdominal wall; tliesi^ have been enumerated in connection with the description of inguinal hernia (p. 296), the coverings being exactly the same as those of llif oblique form of that affection. iFEMALE BLADDEE AND UEETHKA. 785 FEMALE PELVIS. The j)eciiliarities in form of the female pelvis have already been examined with the anatomy of the bones (p. 160). Its lining boun- daries are the same as those of the male. The contents are the bladder, vagina, uterus with its appendages, and rectum. Some por- tion of the small intestine also occupies the upper part of its cavity. The bladder is in relation with the pubes in front, with the Fig. 484.â€”Side view of the viscera of the female pelvis. i. Symphysis pubis. 2. Abdominal pari- etes. 3.

This view is diagrammatic, the vagina being shown diluted ; in the normal state the walls are in loose contact, excepting at the upper part, where the canal has the os uteri projecting into it. uterus behind, from which it is usually separated by a convolution of small intestine, and with the neck of the u.terus and vagina be- neath. The form of the female bladder corresponds with that of the pelvis, being broad from side to side, and often bulging more on one side than on the other. This is particularly evident after -pav- turition. The coats of the bladder are the same as those of the male. The urethra, about an inch and a lialf in length, is lodged in the upper and anterior wall of the vagina, in its course downwards and forwai'ds, beneath the arch of the pubes, to the meatus urinarius. Skene has discovered in each lateral urethi'al wall a mimite tul)ule about f to I of an inch in len^h, passing beneath the mucous mem- brane in the muscular wall ot the urethra ; these canals have been 3 ^VAGINA. 786 named in honoiu- of tlieir discoverer Skene^s tubules. I'lie iiretliia i,- composed of tliree coats, mucous, submucous, and muscular ; tin- mucous coat is vascular, and disjjosed in lougitudirial folds, and iss continuous internally witli the mucous memljrane of the bladder and externally witli that of the vulva. It is provided with a squamous epitheliiim, having a deep stratuui of elongated cells, like the mucous membrane of the bladder, and near its extremity has, opening on its surface, the ducts of numerous racemose mucous glands, the glands of Littre. The submucous coat is loose, and provided with a con- siderable plexus of veins, and in its areolar tissue are situated the racemose mucous glands, which open into the urethra near its ter- mination. The muscular coat consists of two layers, which are con- tinuous with the muscular structure of the bladder, the internal layer being longitudinal, and mingled with areolar and elastic tissue ; the external cii'cular, and continuous with the middle layer of the mus- cular coat. The female urethra is remarkable for its disteusibility, which is only restricted at .the meatus by a ring of dense areolar tissue; hence, in distending the iirethra for surgical purposes, it is often necessary to divide the margin of the meatus with the knife, VAGINA. The vagina is a membranous canal, leading from the vulva to the iiterus, and corresponding in direction Avith the axis of the outlet of the pelvis. It is constricted at its commencement, but near the uterus becomes dilated, and is closed by the contact of the anterior ^vit\\ the posterior wall, so as to appear in sections as a mere longi- tudinal or transverse slit. Its length is variable ; but it is always longer on the posterior than on the anterior wall, the former being usually about five or six inches in length, the latter about four. It is attached to the cervix of the uterus, which latter projects into the u^jper extremity of the canal. Its upjjer fourth is covered pos- teriorly hj the peritoneum, while anteiiorly the peritoneum is re- flected from the cervix uteri without reaching so low as the vagina ; it is firmly connected to the bladder in front, and loosely to the rectum behind ; at the sides it receives the attachment of the posterior layer of the broad ligaments above, and that of the pelvic fascia and levatpres ani l )elow. I ts close connection with the bladder occasions the prolapsus of that organ in cases of prolapsus uteri, while its looser con- nection with the rectiim preserves the latter from a similar accident. Structure.â€”The vagina, about one line in thickness, is composed of three coats : external, fibrous ; middle, muscular ; and internal, mucous. The external or fibrous coat is thin and white, and consists of condensed areolar tissue, with an admixture of elastic fibres. It is firm around the upper part of the tube, and lax iu- ferioriy, and contains in its tissue, especially below, an abundant venous plexus. By its inner surface it is blended with the muscular coat without any distinct separation. The middle or muscular coat is composed of smooth muscular fibre, arranged in longitudinal andVAGINA AND UTERUS. 787 circular bundles, and intermingled with areolar tissue and a con- siderable plexus of veins. Tlie internal or mucous coat is of a pale red colour, and disposed in nu- merous pleats or folds, columnse rugarum; which diA'erge trans- versely from a middle line, orraj)be, situated on the anterior and posterior wall of the vagina ; the rugae are most strongly developed on tlie an- terior wall, and near the entrance of the vagina, and are termed columns of the vagina. In inti- mate structure the mucous membrane consists of areolar and elastic tissue, to whicli its tirmness and elasticity are due, and presents numerous conical papillte embedded in a squamous epi- thelium. The epi- thelium is thick and laminated, resem- bling that of the oesophagus, its upper scales measuring about 1 oVo of ^^'^ inc\i in diameter; it is con- tinuous externally with the epithelium of the vulva, and terminates internally at about the middle of the cervix iiteri. Ojiening on to the surface of the mucous membrane are numerous mucous follicles and glands ; they are especially plentiful in the upper smooth portion of the vagina and around the cervix uteri. " . ' UTERUS. The uterus or womb is a flattened organ of a pyriforni shape, having the base directed upwards and forwards, and the apex down- wards and backwards, in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis, and forming a considerable angle with the course of the Â¥10. 485.â€”Vertical mesiiil section of a iiuUiparous female, showing the .normal position and relations of the j)elvic organs, i.

Its position, liowevei-, varies very greatly with the varyini,' conditions of the bhidder and rectiun ; when tlie bladder is empty the body of the litems may be horizontal. It is convex on it- posterior surface, and somewhat flattened in front; in the uii- impregnated state it is about three inches in length, two in breadtli across its broadest part, and one in thickness; and is divisible into fundus, body, cervix, and os uteri. At the period of puberty the uterus weighs about one ounce and a half ; after parturition from two to three ounces ; and at the ninth month of utero-gestatioii from two to four pounds. The fundus and body are enclosed in a duplicature of perito- neum, which is connected with the sides of the pelvis, and forms a transverse septum between the bladder and rectum. The folds formed by this dupli- cature of peritoneum at each side of the organ are the broad ligaments. Tlie cervix is the lowest portion of the uterus ; it is distinguished from the body by a well-marked constriction ; around its cii - cumference is attached the upper end of the A'agina, and at its extremity is an opening which is nearly round in the virgin, and transverse after parturition, the OS uteri (os tincse), bounded before and behind by two labia ; the posterior labium being somewhat longer than the anterior, and somewhat less thick. Tlie opening of the os uteri is of consideral)]e size, and is named the os uteri externum : the canal then becomes narrowed, and at the upper end of the cervix is constricted into a smaller opening, the os internum. Beyond this point the canal of the cervix expands into the shallow triangular cavil>" of the uterus, the inferior angle corre- si^nding with the os internum, and the two superioi' angles, which are funnel- shaped and represent the original bicornule condition of the organ, with the com- mencement of the Fallopian tubes. Structure.â€”The uterus is composed of three tunics : of an external or serous coat. derived from the peritoneum, which constitutes the duplicatures at each side of the organ called the broad ligaments ; of a viiddlc or muscular coat, and of an internal^ or mucous membrane, Avhich lines its interior, and is continuous on the one hand with the nuicous lining of the Fallopian tubes, and on the other with that of the vagina. . ^ c 4. 11^ The peritoneum forms only a partial covering to the rront 01 the Fig. 486.â€”Median vertical sec- tion through uterus and upper part of vagina. a.

On the posterior aspect it not only covers the whole surface of the uterus, but passes on to the posterior vaginal wall for rather more than an inch, and from thence is continued to the rectum, forming the recto-vaginal pouch or space of Douglas. In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly dense in texture, ofl'ers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uterus the fibres are of large size, distinct, and separable into three layers -. external, which are longitudinal and transverse, the former constituting a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surface and fundus of the organ, the latter being prolonged outwards on the Fallopian tubes, and into the round and ovarian ligaments ; middle, a tliick layer Fig. 487.â€”Uterus with its appendages viewed from the front, i.

This membrane is removed at the left side, but on the right is continuous with tlie anterior layer of the broad ligament. consisting of flat bundles of transverse, longitixdinal, and oblique fibres, complexly interlaced, and traversed by a jjlexus of large veins, which give this portion of the substance of the uterus a spongy appearance : and an internal layer of longitudinal fibres, which is thin and slender, and is disposed chiefly on the back of the fundus. The muscular tissue of the uterus is of the unstriped variety, and consists of long, nucleated, fibre cells, mixed with a con- siderable f[uantity of areolar tissue in which are many nucleated cells. The mucous membrane, of a whitish or pale red colour, is closely connected, or more correctly, is blended with the muscular coat; it is characterised by possessing a very thick layer of muscularis mucosae, a ciliated epithelium, and a number of tubular glands.UTERUS. 790 The muscularis vrucoste forms the greater iparl of the tliickiie.ss of the uterine wall; the hhrem form concentric rings in the fundus, round the opeinngs of the Fallopian tubes, and in the cervix foriu the sphincters of the external and internal os uteri. In the cervix uteri the mucous membrane is somewhat thicker than in the fundus, and on the anterior and posterio]- surface of its canal is disposefl iii folds, plicae palmatae, which have received the name of arbor vitae uterina. In the lower part of the cervix, moreover, are found tili- form pa])illa3, invested by a ciliated epithelium. The mucous glands of the uterus, or uterine glanda, are minute follicles corresponding in length with the thickness of the mucous membrane, very numerous, sometimes simple, sometimes bifid, and sometimes spirally twisted. Their structure reseni1)les other mucous glands, namely, a Ijasement membrane, an epithelium of prismatic cells, with their broad bases and nuclei towards the basement mem- brane, and their narrow ends towards the lumen of the gland. The cells near the mouth of the follicle are surmounted by cilia, the deeper ones being devoid of them. The glands become much en- larged during pregnancy. In the cervix uteri, between the plicae palmatte, are found other mucous follicles which secrete the peculiar transparent mucus of that region. It is these follicles in an imper- forate state which constitute the small transparent vesicles termed ovula Nabothi, seen in the canal of the cervix around the os uteri, and sometimes in its cavity. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the uterus areâ€”the uterine from the internal iliac, and the ovarian from the aorta ; they ramify through the muscidar and mucous coat, forming a plexus of larger vessels in the deep portion of the latter, and of smaller vessels in its su])erficial poi'tion ; from the smaller vessels are given off the capil- laries, which constitute a fine plexus around the glands and a coarse plexus at the surface, the l:)lood from the latter passing into the veins. The veins take the course of the arteries, and terminate in the venous plexus situated on each side of the body of the uterus. In the im- pregnated womb, the veins are so much dilated as to deserve the name of sinuses; they .are thin in structure, and devoid of valves, and their great number in the muscular coat gives a spongy appear- ance to the walls of the jji'egnant uterus. The lymphatics are ]iumerous, the deep commencing in the mucous membrane, the su])erficial taking their course in the subserous tissue ; they follow the direction of the blood-vessels, and terminate in the pelvic and lumbar glands. The nerves of the uterus are derived from the hypogastric and spermatic plexuses, and from the sacral plexus. They fornr a very elaborate plexus, in the midst of which numerous ganglia are found. Of these latter the chief areâ€”one, called the hypogastric or cervical ganglion, which is situated at the side of the cervix just behind the uretei-; another, sjyermatic ganglion, which supplies the fundus uteri ; and a number of smaller ones, called posterior and anterior subperi- tonectl, vesical, and vaginal ganglia.791 FALLOPIAN TUBES. The nerves of the uterus all increase in size during pregnancy, and again decrease after parturition. Appendages of the Uterus. The appendages of the uterus are enclosed by the lateral dui^lica- tures of peritoneum called the broad ligaments. They are the Fallopian tuhes and ovaries. The FALLOPIAN TUBES, or oviducts, are 'situated in tlie upper border of the broad ligaments, and are connected with the superior angles of the uterus. They are somewhat trumpet-shaped, being smaller at the uterine than at the free extremity. The narrow inner extremity has been named by Henle the isthvms, and the wider outer half the ampulla. Each tube is about four inches in length. and more or less flexuous in its course. The canal of the Fallopian tube is exceedingly minute ; its inner extremity opens by means of the ostium uterinum into the upper angle of the cavity of the uterus, and the opposite end into the cavity of the ]3eritoneum. The free or expanded extremity of the Fallopian tube presents a double and sometimes a triple series of small processes or fringes wliich surround the margin of the trum- pet or funnel-shaped opening, the ostium abdominale. This fringe- like appendage to the end of the tube has gained for it the appella- tion of the fimbriated extremity (morsus diaboli). A short liga- mentous cord proceeds from the fimbriated extremity to Ije attached to the distal end of the ovary. Structure.â€”The Fallopian tube is composed of three tunicsâ€”an external and serous investment derived from the peritoneum ; a Fig. 488.â€”Transverse section of Fallopian tube of a nulliparous female, sliowingf three tubes separated by intertubular tissue.

The fibres of smooth muscle are mingled, as in the uterus, with imma- ture nucleated areolar tissue. The mucous membrane is thin, pale, and soft, Avithout villi or glands, and disposed in longitudinal pleats. It is invested by an epithelium consisting of a single layer of conical or filiform ciliated cells, the direction of the vibiations of the cilia being towards the cavity of the uterus. The inner surface of the fimbria is covered with ciliated epithelium, and this is continued for a short distance on to the outer surface, but soon passes into the s(|uamous form, similar in character to the cells covering the peri- toneum. In some instances there are two or more canals, as shown in Fig. 488 : as they are surrounded by a common investment, it is not probable that this appearance is prodticed by great convolution of the tube, and the consequent appearance of several parts of the tube in the same section. If the broad ligament of the uterus be held up to the light, a few scattered tubules will be seen between the ovary and Fallojiian tube. These constitute the par ovarium or organ of Rosenmiiller. They are lined with epithelium, and are closed at their ovarian extremity, but communicate at the other end with an imperfect duct, which in the sow and some other animals forms the duct of Gaertner. . The par ovarium is developed along with the Wolffian body, and seems to be the representative in the female of the coni vasculosi of the testicle of the male. The OVARIES (testis muliehres) are two oblong, flattened, and oval bodies, of a whitish colour and uneven surface, dependent from the posterior layer of peritoneum of the liroad ligaments. They are connected to the upper angles of the uterus at each side by means of a rounded cord, con- sisting of fibrous tissue, and a few muscular fibres derived from the uterus, the ligament of the ovary. By the opposite extremity they are connected by an- other and a shorter ligament to the fim- briated aperture of the Fallopian tube, tuho- ovarian ligament.

The793 STRUCTUEE OF THE OVARIES. cells of this outer membrane differ from those of the peritoneum in being columnar or prigmatic, and in their giving to the surface a dull appearance instead of the smooth glistening character usually distin- guishing serous mem- branes ; the cells have received the name of germ epithelium because they originate the ova. Be- neath this membrane is a layer of condensed stroma, having a white appearance, and called from its supposed resem- blance to one of the coats of the testicle the tunica cUbnginea. The deep part of the stroma is formed of fibrous tissue containing a large number of nuclei and some elastic tissue ; the fibres radiate from the attached border or hilus towards the circumference in small bundles. Under- neath the capsule, the tissue of the oi^gan is crowded Avith closely set vesicles, forming an early condition of the char- acteristic structures of the ovary, the Graafian vesi- cles ; deeper in, the vesicles are less numerous but much larger. The ovisac or Graafian vesicle is a vesicle consist- ing of an external mem- brane and fluid contents. The membrane is com- posed of an outer coat formed by the condensa- tion of the stroma, and sometimes named the tunica fibrosa, a liase- Pin. 490.â€”Section of ovary, a. Germ epithelium. b.

The membrana granuh^a torms a uniform lining to the OA-isac, excepting on the side nearc4 the surface of the ovary, where the cells are accumulated into a small eminence, termed discus proligerus or germinal eminence ihis germinal eminence contains a minute globular nucleated" vesicle, the ovum. The fluid contents of the ovisac, liquor follicvI; are a clear yellowish fluid, and a few free albuminous cells detached' from the membrana granulosa. 'I'he Graafian vesicles are vei \- small in the outer part of the ovary, but are tliere so numerous as to give a granular character distinct from that of the rest of tlie organ ; hence it is defined as the cortical portion. In the deeiiei' portions they are less numerous but larger and more mature, and as they increase in size they displace the cells of the cortical portion in order to reach the surface of the organ. Ovum.â€”The ovum, measuring in its mature state about ^-i^ of an inch in diameter, is a globular vesicle consisting of a cell mem- brane, the vitelline membrane, a yelk or vitellus, and a vesicular nucleated nucleus, the vesicular nucleus being the germinal vesicle, and the nucleolus the germinal spot. The cell membrane is clear and transimrent, and has received the name of zona pellucida; with high magnifying powers, it is, however, possible to make out fine striae passing radially through the membrane, and it is for this reason named the zona striata or striate membrane. The yelk, yellowish and viscid, consists of protoplasm filled with granules and nuclei, and traversed by an extremely fine reticulum. The germinal vesicle measures about inch, and consists of a nuclear network supporting nucleoplasm. As the ovisac attains maturity, it approaches nearer and nearer the capsule of the ovary, and pressing against the capsule renders it so thin that moderate pressure, such as that made by the fibriated extremity of the Fallopian tube, causes the protrusion and rupture both of the ovisac and the capsule of the ovary. By this rupture the ovum is expelled, carrying with it the germinal eminence and part of the membrana granulosa, which in its new relation is termed the germinal disc, discus proligerus. The ovisac, now emptied of its contents, is quickly filled with a sanguineous fluid, i-esulting from the tearing of its vessels, the internal iDortion of the tuniea fibrosa becomes thickened and plicated, and converted into a yelloM' vascular tissue, while the external layer of the tunic retains it> character of a white fibrous membrane. This is the corpus luteuni, a yellowish mass with fast-diminishing cavity, jDlicated structuie, vascular, and enclosed in a thin fibrous layer. It retains these characters up to the second or third month of pregnane}', and then slowly diminishes in size, being gradually lost some months aftei- parturition is complete, or reduced to a small whitish oi" dark coloured mass. The corpora lutea, which are independent of preg-795 ROUND LIGAMENTS. nancy, false corpora lutea, disappear in tlie course of one or two luontlis, and leave behind them a scarcely perceptible trace of their existence. Formation of Ova.â€”The ova are formed from the germ epithe- lium on the surface of the ovary, the cells becoming enlarged and penetrating into the substance of the ovum as shown at ^/, Fig. 490. After passing downwards for a short distance they lose their surface connection, and become enveloped by layers of condensed stroma constituting the walls of the Graafian vesicles ; the germ cell thus comes to form the ovum, its nucleus the germinal vesicle, and a nucleolus which soon appears in the centre of the nucleus the germinal spot. The cells of the membrana granulosa are the pro- duct of the nuclei of the fibro-nuclear tissue forming the stroma. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the ovaries are branches of the uterine and ovarian. The arteries enter the ovary along its inferior border by numerous minute trunks, which pass in a serpen- tine course through its stroma, to be distributed chiefly to the walls of the ovisacs, forming an exterior coarse and interior fine capillary plexus. The veins constitute an ovarian plexus, which terminates in the uterine plexus. The lymphatics, few in number, terminate in the pelvic and lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the spermatic plexus, and take the course of the arteries. The ROUND LIGAMENTS are two niusculo-fibrous cords between four and five inches long, situated within the layers of the broad ligaments, and extending from the upper angles of the uterus and along the inguinal canals to the mons Veneris, in which they are lost. They are composed of smooth muscular fibre and areolar tissue, but towards the internal abdominal rings, have also numei'ous fasciculi of striated muscular fibres. The round ligaments are accompanied by a small artery, by several filaments of the spermatic plexus of nerves, by a plexus of veins, and by a process of the peritoneum which represents the serous membrane investing the spermatic coi'd in the male. In the young subject, this process extends for a short distance along the spermatic canal, and is deno- minated the canal of Nuck : it is sometimes pervious in the adult. The round ligaments serve to retain the uterus in position in the pelvis, and, during utero-gestatioii, to draw the anterior surface of the organ against the abdominal parietes. EXTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION. The female organs of generation are divisible into internal and external; the internal are contained within the pelvis, and have been already descriljed ; they areâ€”the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. The external organs are the mons Veneris, lal)ia majora, labia minora, clitoris, meatus urinarius, and opening of the vagina. â€¢ The mons Veneris is the eminence of integument, situated on796 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. the front of the pubes. Its areolar tissue is loaded with adipose] substance, and the surface covered with hairs. ] The labia majora are two large longitudinal folds of integumentj containing areolar tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling tlie darto.?.] They enclose an elliptical hssure, the common urino-sexual openins or vulva. The vulva receives the inferior opening of the urethral and vagina, and is bounded anteriorly by the anterior commusureA and postei'iorly by the posterior commissure. Stretching across the] posterior commissure is a small transverse fold, the frcenuluml lahiormi or fourchette, which is ruptured during parturition ; and I immediately within this fold a small cavity, the fossa navicularis. The external surface of the labia is covered with hairs; the inner surface is smooth, and lined by mucous meml^rane, which contains a number of large sebaceous glands, and is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. The mass of tissue intervening between the posterioi- commissure and anus is known as the perineal body ; superficiallj^ it is covered by skin, and is generally spoken of by the accoucheur as " the 'perineum." In median sections of the pelvic viscera it is seen to be of triangular form (Fig. 485) with its base directed outwards and its apex inwards and backwards ; it is formed of the interwoven fibres of the sphincter ani and sphincter vaginae, with a large quantity of fat, and fibrous tissue and elastic tissue. The labia minora, or nym- phse, are two smaller folds, situated within the labia majora. Superiorly they are divided into two processes, which surround the glans clitoridis, the superior fold forming the praeputium clitoridis, the inferior its fraenu- lum. Inferiorly, they diminish gradually in size, and are lost 011 the sides of the opening of tlu^ vagina. The nymphai consist of mucous membrane, co\-ered 1 ly a thin cuticular epithelium. They are pro\dded with a number of sebaceous glands, and contain, in their interior, a plexus of blood-vessels. The clitoris is a small elon- gated organ situated in front of 1 the pubes, and supported by a suspensory ligament. It is formed by a small body, analogous to tlie corpus cavernosum penis, and, like it, arises from the ramus of the os pul)is and ischium at each side by two crura. At the extremity of the clitoris is a small accumulation of erectile tissue which is highly sensitive^ and is termed the glans. Fig. 491.â€”External organs of generation of the female, i.

The corpus cavernosum clitoridis, like that of the penis, is composed of erectile tissue enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, and is susceptible of erection. Like the penis, also, it is provided with two small muscles, the erectores clitoridis. At about an inch behind the clitoris, is the entrance of the vagina, an elliptical opening, marked by a prominent margin. Tlie entrance to the vagina is closed in the virgin by a duplicature of mucous membrane of a semilunar form, which is stretched across the opening ; this is the hymen. Sometimes the membrane forms a comj)lete septum, and gives rise to inconvenience by preventing the escape of the menstrual effusion. It is then called an imper- forate hymen. The hymen must not be considered a necessary accompaniment of virginity, for its existence is uncertain. Wlien present, it assumes a variety of appearances ; it may be a mem- branous fringe, with round opening in the centre ; or a semilunar fold, leaving an opening in front ; or a transverse septum, having an opening both in front and behind ; or a vertical band with an opening at each side. The rupture of the hymen, or its rudimentary existence, gives rise to the appearance of a fringe of papillae around the opening of the vagina ; these are called carunculse msrrtiformes. The triangular smooth surface between the clitoris and the en- trance of the vagina, which is bounded at each side by the upj)er portions of the nymphte, is the vestibule. At the posterior jjart of the vestibule and near the margin of the vagina is the opening of the urethra, the meatus urinarius ; and around tlie meatus an elevation of the mucous membi'ane formed by the aggregation of numerous mucous glands. This prominence serves as a guide to finding the meatus in the operation of in- troducing the female catheter. Beneath the vestibule at each side, and extending from the clitoris to the side of the \-agina, are two oblong or pyriform bodies, consisting of erectile tissue enclosed in a tliiu layer of fibrous membrane. These bodies are narrow above, broad and rounded below, and are teraied by Kobelt, who considers them analogous to the bulb of the male urethra, the bulbi vestibuli. Beliind these bodies and lying against the outer wall of the vagina are two small glands, analogous to Cowjier's glands in the male subject; they are the glands of Bar- tholin or Duvernay. Each gland opens by means of a long excre- tory duct on the inner side of the corresponding nympha. In front of the masses of erectile tissue forming the bulb of the vestibule is a smaller plexus of vessels continuous with those of that body behind and with the erectile tissue of the glans clitoridis in front ; it has been named by Kobelt the pars intermedia, and is supjDosed to cor- res]5ond with that part of the corpus spongiosum penis lying in front of the bulb of the urethra in the male. The mucous membrane of the external organs, about a quarter of a line in thickness, is composed of areolar and elastic tissue, without fat, and rich in capillary vessels. It is furnished with798 MAMMARY GLANDS. muuerous papilloa, which are large on tlie laljia minora, smaller on the clitoris, and is invested by a squamous epithelium. On the internal surface of the labia majora, on the lalna minora, an-l occasionally around the meatus urinarius and entrance of the vagina, there exist sebaceous glands ; wliile on the vestilnde, around tin- meatus urinarius and around the enti'ance of the vagina, there is an abundance of racemose mucous glands, opening on the surface of the membrane by shorter and longer ducts. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The external organs of generation an; abundantly supplied with arteries, chiefly by the internal pudic ; they terminate in a deep and superficial capillary plexiis, as in othei- mucous membranes. Valentin has described helicine arteries in the clitoris. The veins returning the blood from the ca]Hllaries form a rich j)lexus, which is especially abundant in the bulbi vestibuli ol Kobelt. The lymphatics are numerous, and communicate parti}- with the inguinal and partly with the pelvic glands. The nerv<:s are derived partly from the hypogastric plexus and partly from the sacral plexus. MAMMARY GLANDS. The mammae are situated in the pectoral region, and are sepa- rated from the pectoralis major muscle by a thin laj^er of superficial fascia. Their base is somewhat elli^jtical, the long diameter corre- sponding with the direction of the fibres of the pectoralis major muscle ; and the left mamma is generally a little larger than tlii' right. Near the centre of the convexity of each mamma is a small pro- minence of the integument, called the nipple (mammilla), which is surrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In females of fair complexion before impregnation, the colour of the areola is a delicate pink ; after impregnation, it enlarges and assumes a brownisli hue, which deepens in colour as pregnancy advances ; and after the birth of a child, the brownish tint continues through life. The areola is furnished with a number of sebaceous glands, which secrete a peculiar fatty substance for the protection of the delicate integument around the nipple. During suckling these glands increase in size, and have the appearance of suiall pimple.s, IDrojecting from the skin. At this period the}^ serve by their secre- tion to defend the nipple and areola from the excoriating action of the mouth of the infant. In strudiire, the mamma is a compound racemose or conglomerate gland, consisting of lobes, lobules, and gland-vesicles. The lobes, from 15 to 25 in number, have each a separate system of lobules and gland-vesicles, and a distinct excretory duct; hence, the mamma may be regarded as being composed of a number of separate glands, their excretory ducts converging to the nipple, and terminating at its extremity by distinct apertures. The lobes are irregular in size and form, flattened, and bounded by rounded angles ; they are madeI STEUCTUEE OF THE MAMMAEY GLAND. 799 up of smaller lobes or lobiiles, and tlie lobules of other lobules still more diminutive, the smallest lobules consisting of round or pyri- forni gland-vesicles or alveoli. The gland-vesicles or alveoli, about of an inch in diameter, are composed of a basement membrane, lined with an eintheliuw., which changes in character with the varying conditions of the organ, r When the gland is inactive, the alve- oli are very small, and the lining cells are small and granular. Wlien active secretion is going on, the alve- oli are large and distended with fluid, the epithelial cells are flattened out against the mucous membrane and contain fat globules. The alveoli ' communicate witli an excretorj'- duct, and the excretory ducts of all the lobules unite to form a common excretory duct or canal for each lobe, galactophorus duct. The duct, taking its course beneath the areola, dilates into an elongated sac or ampulla, and reaching the base of the mammilla, contracts in size and bends oiitwards into pio. 492.-Gland-ye8icles of the mam- that process to terminate at its mary gland during lactation, show- extremity by a small aperture. ^^f^th^ ^^^^"8^ ''^^'^ capillary There are from 15 to 25 ducts in t he nipple, a number corresponding with the number of lobes com- posing the gland. I The gland-vesicles are held together by a dense white areolar ! tissue, which unites the lobules into lobes, and connects the dif- 1 ferent lobes with eacli oilier, forming a covering for the whole, ; and being itself surrounded with adipose tissue. The galacto- I phorus ducts are composed of areolar tissue, with longitudinal and cii'cular elastic fibres, and, according to Henle, tliere is an indication I of longitudinal smooth muscular fibre ; they are lined by columnar â€¢ epithelium, passing into the squamous form near the ojDenings on the nipple. The mammilla or nipple is covered by a thin epidermis, present- ing more or less pigment in its rete inucosum ; it jjossesses at the extremity a number of papillse, between which are the lactiferous Openings, and it is composed internally of the ducts, united together and surrounded by areolar and smooth muscular tissue, the latter giving the nipple the faculty of erection and retraction. Tlie inte- gument of the areola, besides possessing a coloured epidermis with numerous large sudoriparous and sebaceous glands, the latter associated with fine hairs, is also provided with a layer of smooth muscular fibre, which gives it a power of contraction.8oo MAMMARY GLANDS. The secretion of milk is elfected by tlie foi'mation of oil- giolmlert in the epithelial cells of tlie gland-vesicles ; the epithelial cells being perfected, are pushed outwards and displaced hy a new layer of similar cells which form beneath them ; they are thus cm - ried forward into tlie lacteal ducts, where the cell bursts and gi\ ( > exit to its oil-globules, now become milk-glohuks; and tlie cel]- membrane and nucleus are lost. These milk-globules suspended in a fluid, the milk-ijlasma, constitute the milk. Previously to concep- tion, the mammae only secrete a yellowish viscid mucus, and at llic commencement of lactation the milk is imperfect and termed coi't- strum, having entering into its composition a number of cells fille'l with yellow fat globiiles, named colostrum corpuscles. The mammary gland of the male is rudimentary ; it varies in size fi'om a quarter of an inch to two inches in breadth, by one three lines in thickness. It is firm in texture, presents no division into lobes, and its ducts are small without dilatations, and terminate in gland-vesicles larger than those of the female. At birth the mammary' gland measures between two and four lines in breadth, and presents from twelve to fifteen lolnilar divi- sions, and then goes on gradually, but very slowly, increasing in bulk. True gland-vesicles do not make their appearance until the period of menstruation, and are not fully developed throughout the entire gland until the first pregnancy. After the period of child- bearing, the gland generally degenerates, the gland-vesicles di.-^- apjsear, and in old age the organ passes into a state of atrophy, the ducts, with their epithelium in a state of fatty degeneration, alone remaining, surrounded by a cushion of fat which takes the place of the glandular tissue. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The mammse are supplied with a.rterii.< from the thoracic branches of the axillary, the intercostals, and internal mammary ; having entered the substance of the gland they divide into capillaries, which constitute a close network around the gland-vesicles. The veins form an incomplete circle around the base of the nipple, circulus verifsus Halleri, from which larger veins conduct the blood to the circumference of the gland, and by these communications form a plexus on its surface. They terminate in the axillary vein, internal mammary, intercostals, and jugular vein?. The lymphatics are abundant in the integument covering the mamniEe. In the gland itself the lymphatic capillaries commence in the fibrous connective tissue between the gland vesicles, and thr vessels formed therefrom accompany the veins and milk-ducts. The main lymphatic trunks run for the most part along the edge of the pectoralis major muscle to end in the axillary glands, but_ othei.- pass through the intercostal spaces to reach the anterior mediastinal glands. The nerves of the mammary gland are derived from the ante- rior cutaneous branches of the second, third, and fourth intei- costal nerves, and from the lateral cutaneous branches of the same nerves.GLOSSAKY OF ANATOMICAL TERMS.

UNUSUAL MUSCULAR ABNORMALTIES. 359 1 Macalister, op. cit. p. 91. the origin of the flexor suhlimis digitorum, the muscular fibres which are attached to the posterior surface of the tendon, form a roundish belly three quarters of an inch in diameter, which terminates in a tendon that extends up on the anterior surface of the muscle. The tendon of insertion becomes flat as it descends, and is inserted in the following manner :—internally the fibres are attached to the pisiform and unciform, externally the tendonous fibres are inserted into the trapezium and scaphoid, and the middle fibres into the annular ligament. A flat muscular band, one inch and a half in width, takes origin from the deep fascia of the forearm three inches above the wrist, and from the tendon of insertion of the previous muscle, descends to the hand and becomes continuous with the fibres of the abductor minimi digiti. This muscle is a somewhat unusual variety of the radio- carpus. Mr Wood and Dr Macalister found this muscle attached to the annular ligament and co-existing with the ordinary palmaris.1 N.B.—The example of the radio carpus given above may be regarded as a variety of palmaris.

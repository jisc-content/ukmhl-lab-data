Observations on the Thickness of the Human Skull. 4 Where two measurements are given, connected by a hyphen, the first indicates the size of the right, the second that of the left. The numbers indicate sixty-fourths of an inch. Thus, in No. 1, the thickness of the frontal near the superior angle is -Jf \ inch. The column immediately succeeding M contains the nature of the convolution markings. These are usually best marked at the base. For the greater number they were slight or absent at the roof. a. Convolution markings slight. (3. No convolution markings. y. Convolution markings distinct over lower parietal part. In a few cases casts of the interior of the skull were made to determine how far the convolution markings would indicate the position of the fissures. From a study of these it was seen that the convolutions of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe and the lower surface of the frontal were repeated in their cast, but the upper surface of the cast was nearly smooth in many cases. The mean of the observations in each case is given. It will be seen that although in many cases the thickness on one side exceeds slightly that of the other, yet the mean of one side does not differ materially from that of the other. The thickest skull was that of a female, aged 78, No. 144; but the three succeeding were males. The thinnest skulls in the above list were those of three females. These remarks, however, do not apply to all the measurements. And it must be remembered that the number of female subjects was in excess of the number of the males. A single measurement is not an indication of the general thickness, for in No. 84 the inferior occipital fossje have a very thin bony wall. The weight of the brain does not seem to bear any relation to the thickness of the skull. This, however, does not affect the statement that the skull thickens when the brain diminishes.

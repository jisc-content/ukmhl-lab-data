DIVISION OF THE SCAPHOID BONE OF THE CARPUS. 255 Coalescence of tlie Semilunar and Cuneiform. The specimen which I have represents a case of perfect union of the semilunar and cuneiform. The upper surface of the former passes into that of the latter without any interruption, and the large convex quadrilateral facet would seem to limit the extent of the former bone. The anterior faces of the bones are continuous, as also the posterior. The bones can be. best limited on the inferior surface. From without inwards first comes an antero-posterior concave facet, then a linear facet for the unciform separated from the former by a ridge, then a groove succeeded by a double curved surface. This condition ap- proaches that of the carpus of Pteropus, when the bones of the first row are united. Wagner met with a case similar to that described.1

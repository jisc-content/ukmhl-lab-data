NOTES ON A CASE OF ABNORMAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE PERITONEUM. A male subject, brought to the Rooms during last session:— Peritoneum healthy; stomach, duodenum, liver, spleen, pancreas and large intestine normal in position and peritoneal covering. Jejunum and ileum, with the exception of the lower four inches of the latter contained in a sac, having the following relations :— Above, it was bounded by the spleen and pancreas, but separated from them by the transverse mesocolon; below, it extended downwards to the iliac fossa, its long axis, however, being directed downwards, forwards, and to the right, and attached by slight adhesions to the right groin. Internally, it became narrower, and terminated at the anterior surface of the aorta, over the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery ; in this position it was constricted. Externally, it was bounded by the descend- ing colon. The anterior surface was free. Posteriorly were the kidney, quadratus lumborum, and psoas muscles. Arrangement of Vessels.—The superior mesenteric artery sup- plied the ascending colon from its right side as usual, the ilio- colic, right colic, and middle colic arteries being normal in position and relations. The arteries to the small intestines disap- peared through an aperture in front of the aorta, passing thus to supply the jejunum and ileum. The veins collecting the blood from the parts supplied by these arteries united in the superior

V2 MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE AND PHARYNX. the latter, and in the same bird I have found the geniohyoid proper consisting of two bands on each side. The ceratoglossus of birds, by a similar extension, would produce that portion of the superior constrictor known as glossopharyngeus. Examples of muscular extensions to fit certain structures for definite actions are not wanting in the animal series. In that of python, given above, a retractor of the os hyoides extends back to the vertebral spines; and a muscle, having a similar action in the os quadratum, reaches the nuchal fascia. The examination of the omohyoid in man and animals show that this muscle may be reduced to a muscular slip, or have an extensive attachment to the scapula and clavicle. It is of interest to note in this connection that the depressors of the hyoid bone are known to extend (in part) into the tongue as a permanent (sloth) condition, and examples are known where the sternothyroid was continued into the tongue and middle constrictor muscles.

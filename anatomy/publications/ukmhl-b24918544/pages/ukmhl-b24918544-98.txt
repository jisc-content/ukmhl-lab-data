Respiratory Excitation and Depression. 6 of oxygen in the blood is greatly diminished, the quantity of carbonic acid being little affected ; in the latter the carbonic acid is greatly in- creased, whilst the oxygen Pfluger found in some experiments increased.8 Dyspnoea can be produced by opening the thoracic cavity and punc- turing the lung over the surface ; if oxygen or air be forced into the lung through the trachea the dyspnoea disappears, and will reappear if car- bonic acid or nitrogen be substituted for the former gases (Traube). It can also be induced by fitting a stop-cork to a trachea canula and dimi- nishing the aperture.13 The following method, adopted by Dr. von Kries and myself in our experiments in Professor Ludwig’s laboratory, has this advantage, that the resistances in different experiments can be easily ascertained and compared. A trachea canula was fitted to Muller’s bottles ;c the dyspnoea was produced by lowering the tube in the mercury of the inspiration bottle. Some of the results are shown in the following table:— Table I. Time Number of respirations in five seconds Temperature Resistance in millimetres Duration of resistance H.

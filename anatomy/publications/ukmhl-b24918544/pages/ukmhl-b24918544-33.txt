OBSERVATIONS M. Weight of brain. ON THE THICKNESS OF THE HUMAN SKULL, The variation in the thickness of the human skull in different individuals, and in different parts of the same skull, is well known. The causes of these varieties have been assigned to the character of the soft parts, the changing character of the brain, and are, in a great measure, due to the same causes that regulate the growth and development of the individual. The following observations were in 154 skulls of subjects brought to the anatomical rooms. The measurements were made with callipers carefully adjusted, and in the following regions:â€” A. The superior angle of the frontal in the superior longitu- dinal sinus. B. Above the external angular process. C. Parietal eminence. D. The anterior superior angle of the parietal outside the longi- tudinal sinus and the Pacchionian depressions. E. The posterior superior angle of the parietal. F. Posterior inferior angle of the parietal in the lateral sinus. G. In the middle fossa, near the centre of the squamous part of the temporal bone. H. Occipital (superior angle) in the longitudinal sinus. I. Occipital at the middle of the inferior fossae. *1. Occipital protuberance. K. Occipital superior fossa?. \j. Frontal eminence.

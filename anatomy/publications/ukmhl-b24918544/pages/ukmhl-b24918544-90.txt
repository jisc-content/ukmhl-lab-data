A PALATINE BRANCH FROM THE MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY. By R. J. Anderson, M.D., Demonstrator of Anatomy, Queen’s College, Belfast. In a Male Subject.—The following arrangement obtains on the right side of the head and neck. The superior thyroid arises one quarter of an inch from the origin of the carotid. The lingual and facial arise by a common trunk three-quarters of an inch in length; the latter gives off the inferior palatine. The ascending pharyngeal comes from the posterior surface of the carotid close to its origin. An accessory pharyngeal is derived from the external carotid (posterior surface) close to the origin of the facial-lingual trunk. The internal maxillary gives off the tympanic and middle meningeal, the latter the small meningeal; the other arteries are normal in distribution and relations. On the left side, the common carotid divides in the usual place. The following is the arrangement of the branches of the external carotid :—The lingual arises one inch from the bifurcation. The facial comes from the external carotid one-eighth of an inch higher than the lingual, and gives off the inferior palatine, which passes in between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus; before the passage of the artery through the space indicated, it gives off a tonsilar.

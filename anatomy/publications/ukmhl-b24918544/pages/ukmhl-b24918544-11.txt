THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE OMOHYOID MUSCLE.* â€¢ \ The omohyoid muscle occupies a somewhat isolated position, and, as usually seen in man and many vertebrates, attached by one extremity to the bone of the upper extremity and by the other end to the hyoid bone mediately or immediately, it has given rise to much discussion. Professor Henie, in his handbook, states that the anterior belly of the omohyoid is a muscle analogous to the sternohyoid, the posterior to a v digitation of the serratus magnus, and the tendon uniting the anterior and posterior belly has the significance of a cervical rib. As the lowest cervical rib is not developed the two muscle bellies pass into one another by means of a tendinous inscription. b Professor Gegenbaur from an examination of the different varieties ^ of the muscle was led to a different result. The varieties which seem to point to the conclusion at which Henie arrived are described by Theile, Gruber, Lusclika, and other anatomists. The muscle described by the first anatomist as attached to the upper border of the scapula at the place of origin of the normal omohyoid (which was absent in this case) and by its opposite extremity to the first rib has been regarded by succeeding observers as a variety of the subclavius. The instance given fyy Professor Gruber0 is named subclavius by him, and the cases men- tioned by Lusclika, Gegenbaur explains in a similar manner, and shows that these cannot be regarded as transitional forms of the omohyoid.d The same anatomist points out that tendinous inscriptions have not usually the significance of ribs, and adduces the examples of the biventer a Read before the Ulster Medical Society, Session 1880-81. b Handbuch d.

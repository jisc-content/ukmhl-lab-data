By Dr. B. J. Anderson. 5 introduced into the wound increases the number of the respirations when the carotid is tied, and that hot water brought into contact with wounds in the thighs increases the frequency of the respira- tions. The same observer has found that section of the spinal cord at the lower part of the neck diminishes the power of heat in pro- ducing an increase in the number of the respirations, and enables artificial respiration to produce apnoea when the blood is heated. He concludes that warmed blood and skin stimulation are factors, the latter the more important, in the production of heat dyspnoea. The same observer regards the venosity of the blood as the sole or principal cause of the action of the nerve centres.

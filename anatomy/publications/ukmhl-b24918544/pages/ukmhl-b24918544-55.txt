I enlarge the fossa. The pressure will be still more effective if it be assisted by violent motion of the body, such as takes place in riding on horseback. Lying on the left side, coeteris paribus, as in one case noted by Treitz, would also favour the ingress of the intestine. The rapidity of the passage of the intestine into the fossa would thus increase with the quantity that has passed in, whilst its return is prevented by the same means.1 In conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to Prof. Kedfem for much assistance in the preparation of this description. 1 For additional cases consult J.

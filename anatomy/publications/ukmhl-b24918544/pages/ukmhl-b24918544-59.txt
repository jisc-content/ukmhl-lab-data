NOTES Otf A DISSECTION OF A CASE OF EPISPADIAS. The pelvis had been divided on each side of the middle line in front of the acetabula. The anterior wall of the abdominal wall is complete. The depth of the symphysis or its representative is half an inch, the distance between the pubic bones half an inch, the space between being filled with fibrous tissue. The bones are very movable at the joint. Below the pubes the skin passes into mucous membrane at the front and sides, and a funnel-shaped opening leads into the bladder. This opening is situated below the pubes at a distance of three quarters of an inch from the upper border of the fibrous band. Below the orifice is situated the penis, three inches in length, flat and grooved on the upper surface. The groove extends the whole length of the organ, and becomes somewhat wider near the anterior extremity. Near the anterior extremity two lateral grooves or fissures are situated, each three quarters an inch in length. Foramina are to be seen on the floors, and by drawing the penis forwards the openings of the ducts of Morgagni and the verumontanum come into view. The penis is terminated by a glans, bordered by a prepuce with a frsenum; the former is confined to the lower surface, and is at the frsenum one inch in length ; but it diminishes towards the sides. On running the finger and thumb along the penis, the corpora cavernosa can be felt as two separate bodies, but more distinctly behind than in front. At a distance of three quarters of an inch behind the anterior extremity of the penis, they become more closely united, and immediately in front of this a slight change in the resisting power of the tissue is felt. The scrotum is large, and the testes

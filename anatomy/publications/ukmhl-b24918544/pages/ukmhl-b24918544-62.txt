DISSECTION OF A CASE OE EHSPADIAS. 6 have not yet united, the septum between the intestine and the urino-genital tube be completed, and the orifice of the latter be placed farther forwards than usual, unless indeed a corres- ponding change take place in the position of the crura, the latter will come to occupy the posterior part of the orifice, the corpus spongiosum may have its free development interfered with, and the urethra will be incompletely covered. The urethral open- ing, taking the average of 22 cases, male and female, was situated 2\ inches below the upper border of the symphysis; in the case of epispadias, the distance was three quarters of an inch. The condition of the ectopia vesicse may be referred to the same cause. If the opening of the primitive urinary tube be placed very much farther forwards than usual, namely, in a part where active increase in the tissues takes place, a foramen which would remain relatively small if maintained in the ordinary position, may become large by participating in the growth of the tissues, or by representing an amount of tissue absent. And the increase of the bladder which gives this viscus its character would be very different when compared with an opening placed higher up than the usual position. Baillie’s and Luschka’s cases may be explained by the fact, that the corpus spongiosum is more free behind.

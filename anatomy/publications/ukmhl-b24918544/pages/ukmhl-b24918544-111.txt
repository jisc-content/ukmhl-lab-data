NOTE ON APNCEA AND HEAT DYSPNOEA. During the Winter Session, 1879-80, a paper was read by me at the Ulster Medical Society, entitled “ Respiratory Excitation and Depression.” Some points of importance bearing on the history, nature, and cause of apncea and heat dyspnoea have since come to my knowledge, and I shall here briefly state them. APNCEA. As far back as 1858 Professor Brown-Sequard showed that pressure on the head of an animal affected the character of the respirations. The respirations are slowed by pressure upon the head. Subsequently the same physiologist found that injection of carbonic acid, nitrogen, and other gases with force into the laryngeal side of a tracheal opening produced apnoea; the same phenomenon appeared, but in a less degree, when the injection was made into the pulmonary side. The result of the experiments was doubted by Filehne, but his mistake arose from the fact that he did not carry out the details of the experiments. Some experiments that have a very important bearing upon the cause of apncea were made by Professor Brown-Sequard a con- siderable time ago; and during last winter and the present summer not only have the results been confirmed, but many important facts have been added thereto. The experiments were made principally ^ on dogs and rabbits. If a dog be fixed in the usual position on Bernard’s dog-board, the trachea opened, and a canula introduced for the purposes of artificial respiration if necessary, but more especially with the

Respiratory Excitation and Depression. 8 If an animal is introduced into a hot-air bath, and the temperature so regulated as to produce an increase in the temperature of the animal (the temperature is determined by means of a thermometer placed in the vagina or rectum), when such an increase is sufficiently great, the respirations increase in number, and diminish in depth. The respirations can be registered in various ways. The apparatus of Mareya and Bertb are described in their works; many other methods are given by Cyon. 0 A very convenient method is the following:—A small bag connected with a glass tube is introduced into the oesophagus, and passed down to the thorax to within a short distance of the oesopha- geal opening of the stomach; the other end of the tube is connected with a Marey’s tambour; the bag is dilated with water, introduced by means of a syringe after the bag has been passed down to the thorax. An alteration in the capacity of the thorax causes a movement of the lever of the tambour, so that the respirations can be easily registered. Table II. gives the results of an increased temperature upon the respirations of a dog (Figs. 3 and 4). Table II. (The temperature and the number of respirations in five seconds are given.)

THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE AND PHARYNX. Accounts have been given of the muscles of the tongue with a view to determine their position and relations (morphologically) to the surrounding parts. These have generally been regarded by anatomists as useful in acquiring a knowledge of the muscles rather than exhaustive inquiries into their exact relations. The tongue seems to be a special appendage of the pharynx, for although it is first to be recognised in the chick as an eleva- tion in the floor of the mouth, it receives only its mucous covering from the epiderm. The tongue is placed in relation with the first, second, and third arches at its earliest appearance, and in front (or below) the primitive digestive tube, a position which it maintains in the adult. The development of the air tube also limits the area of formation, and its connection with the wisceral arches formed in connection with the pharynx, as well as the relations of the parts in the adult, point to a simi- larity existing between the muscles of the pharynx and those of the tongue. The muscles uniting the derivatives of the visceral arches with the base of the skull may be stated as follows:—Muscles uniting the base of the skull with the first arch,—the internal and external pterygoids (in part), the tensor palati, and laxator tympani; the base of the skull with the second—the stapedius (formed in connection with second); first with second—an occasional bundle of stylohyoid ; first with third—the anterior belly of the digastric geniohyoid and geniogloss ; the second and third—stylohyoid, and occasional slip of stylopharyngeus ; third with the base of the skull—posterior belly of the digastric.

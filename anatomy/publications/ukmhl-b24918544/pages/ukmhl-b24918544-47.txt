DIAMETERS OF HUMAN VERTEBRAE IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. 343 D. The means of the antero-posterior diameter of the bodies of twenty-eight vertebral columns. E. The mean of antero-posterior diameters of twenty-live vertebral columns. F. Anterior, and G. Posterior vertical diameters in different regions. A table is added with the mean of collective heights. The measurements given above point to the following con- clusions :â€” (1.) The anterior vertical diameters of the vertebrae, from the 1st dorsal to the 3rd lumbar inclusive, are less than the posterior. (2.) The anterior vertical diameter of the 4th lumbar is equal to its posterior, and in the 5th it is greater. (3.) The transverse diameters of the bodies increase from 2nd cervical to 2nd dorsal, then diminish to 5th dor- sal, then increase to last lumbar. (4.) The antero-posterior diameters increase gradually from 3rd cervical to 3rd lumbar, and then diminish. (5.) The non-equivalence of the lateral parts of the bodies is generally observable from the 7th to the 10th dorsal, but may extend to the 3rd and 11th vertebrae. [Table.

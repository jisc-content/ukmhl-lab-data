4 modern races. The series illustrating fracture and union of bones is very extensive, and the surgical results are apparently as good as are obtained by modern means. The ulna was the bone most frequently broken, owing, says Professor Elliot Smith, to the forearm being held up to ward off blows in a peculiar style of fencing still practised in modern Egypt. The clavicle and femur were also frequently the site of fracture. The form of splints—the earliest known—used for fracture of the fore- arm in predynastic times is shown by two specimens.

Spondylitis deformans was very common, especially among the predynastic inhabitants. Besides the pathological series, the Collection also includes two small but interesting sets of specimens illustrating (1) the methods and technique of embalming; (2) the racial characters of the various peoples found during the survey. The oldest — predynastic inhabitants — were

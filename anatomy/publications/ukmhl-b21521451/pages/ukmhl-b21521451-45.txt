29 FRONTAL BONE. | vein which communicates with the nasal veins. On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the glandulse Pacchioni, and on the orbital plates a number of irregular pits called digital fossce, which correspond with the convolutions of the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. The superior border is thick and strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the internal table in the middle, where it rests on the junction of the two parietal, and at the expense of the external Fig. IS* table on each side where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones. The inferior border is thin, irregular, and squamous, and articulates with the sphenoid bone. * Internal surface of the frontal bone; the bone is raised to show the orbito- nasal portion. 1. Grooved ridge for the lodgment of the superior longitudinal sinus and attachment of the falx. 2. Foramen caecum. 3. Superior or coronal border of the bone; the figure is situated near that part which is bevelled at the expense of the internal table. 4. Inferior border of the bone. 5. Orbital plate of the left side. 6. Cellular border of the ethmoidal fissure. The foramen caecum (2) is seen through the ethmoidal fissure. 7. Anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramen; the anterior is seen leading into its canal. 8. Nasal spine. 9. The depression within the external angular process (12) for the lachrymal gland. 10. Depression for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye; immediately to the left of this number is the supraorbital notch, and to its right the internal angular process. , 11. Opening leading into the frontal sinuses; the leading line crosses the internal angular process. 12. External angular process. The corresponding parts are seen on the other side of the figure.

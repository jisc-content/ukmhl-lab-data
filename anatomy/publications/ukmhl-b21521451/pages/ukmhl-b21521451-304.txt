MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OP THE FOOT. 292 Fourth Layer. Interossei plantares. The Interossei plantares muscles are three in number, and are placed upon rather than between the metatarsal bones. They arise from the base of the metatarsal bone of the three outer toes, and are inserted into the inner side of the extensor tendon and base of the first phalanx of the same toes. In their action they are adductors. Relations.—By their superficial surface with the dorsal inter- ossei and metatarsal bones. By their deep surface with the ex- ternal plantar artery and veins, adductor pollicis, transversus pedis, and flexor minimi digiti. Actions.—All the preceding muscles act upon the toes ; and the movements which they are capable of executing may be referred to four heads, viz., flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction. In these actions they are grouped in the following manner:— Flexion. Flexor longus digitorum, Flexor brevis digitorum, Flexor accessorius, Flexor minimi digiti. Extension. Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor brevis digitorunu Adduction. x , . ( one dorsal, Interossei, j three Adduction. Interossei, three dorsal, Abductor minimi digiti. The great toe, like the thumb in the hand, enjoys an independent action, and is provided with distinct muscles to perform its move- ments. These movements are precisely the same as those of the other toes, viz. :— Flexion. Flexor longus pollicis, Flexor brevis pollicis. Extension. Extensor proprius pollicis, Extensor brevis digitorum. Adduction. Adductor pollicis, Transversus pedis. A oduction. Abductor pollicis. The only muscles excluded from this table are the lumbricales, four small muscles, which, from their attachments to the tendons of the long flexor, appear to be assistants in its action.

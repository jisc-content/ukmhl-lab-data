120 STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE. shape, and more or less flattened ; their membranous envelope is thick and sometimes laminated, and they contain in their interior a clear fluid, together with nuclei, oil globules, and more or less granular matter. Cartilage cells have an average measurement of Y^^th of an inch in long diameter ; they are sometimes isolated, Fig. 69 * Fig. 70.f sometimes grouped in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. Near the bone they are larger than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender (fusi- form), and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish Fig. 71 % an(^ opaline in colour, its intercellular substance being semitransparent, and homogeneous or finely granular. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify ; in which case the intercellular substance becomes fibrous and more or less opaque, its co- lour yellowish, and the cells filled with a greater number of oil-globules than in its natural state. The special chemical proximate principle of the matrix of car- tilage is chondrine, its cells yielding gelatine. * Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage. The drawing is made from the same section as fig. 68, the part selected being midway between the free surface of the cartilage and the bone. f Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage near to, and at its free surface. The figure is drawn from the same section as the two preceding. The edge to the right, where the cells are most condensed, represents the free surface? The cells exhibit the fusiform shape. % A portion of reticular cartilage. The section is made from the pinna, and magnified 155 times.

THIRD VENTRICLE. 458 riorly by the anterior commissure and crura of the fornix; and posteriorly by the posterior commissure and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. The third ventricle is crossed by three * Third and fourth ventricle. 1. Fifth ventricle, between the layers of the septum lucidum. 2, 2. Corpora striata. 3,3. Thalami optici; the figures are placed on the part termed " collieulus." 4,4. The pulvinar. 5,5. Tenia semicircularis. 6,6. Crura of the fornix, cut across. 7. Middle commissure of the third ventricle. 8. Posterior commissure of the third ventricle; the space between the thalami optici (3,3), in which the commissures (7, 8) are placed, is the third ventricle. 9. Pineal gland. 10,10. Peduncles of the pineal gland, prolonged forward as streaks (stria? medullares colliculi nervorum opticorum) to the crura of the fornix, 6, 6. 11,11. Kates. 12,12. Testes. 11,11, and 12,12, are the corpora quadrigemina. 13. Brachium anterius. 14. Brachium posterius. 15. Corpus geniculatum internum. 16. Corpus geniculatum ex- ternum. 17, 17. The laqueus. 18,18. Processus e cerebello ad testes. 19, 19. Crura cerebri. 20. Valve ofVieussens. 21. Section of the processus e cerebello ad testem, or superior peduncle of the cerebellum. 22. Section of the corpus restiforme, or middle peduncle. 23. Section of the crus cerebelli or inferior peduncle. 24. Fourth ventricle; the two bodies on which the figure is placed are the eminentise teretes. 25. Ala? cinerese of the floor of the fourth ventricle; this part of the ventricle is termed the calamus scriptorius. 26. Fasciculi graciles at their upper part, where they constitute the enlarge- ments known as the processus clavati. They are separated by the posterior median fissure, and the dark aperture at the top of this fissure is the ventricle of Arantius. 27, 27. Striae medullares, the origin of the portio mollis nerve. 28, 28. Fasciculi laterales of the spinal cord. 29, 29. Fasciculi cuneati. Fig. 185* commissures, anterior, mid- dle, and posterior ; and be- tween these are two spaces, called foramen commune an- terius and foramen commune posterius. The Anterior commissure is a small rounded white cord, which enters the corpus striatum at either side, and reaches the substance of the hemispheres ; the middle, or soft commissure consists of grey substance, which is con- tinuous with the grey lining of the ventricle, it connects the adjacent sides of the tha- lami optici; the posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white cord, connecting the two tha- lami optici posteriorly. The space between the an- terior and middle commis- sure is called the foramen commune anterius, and is that to which Monro has

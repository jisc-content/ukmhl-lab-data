The anterior roots, at their entrance into the cord, divide into two fasciculi, inner and outer; the inner fasciculus, enter- ing the inner side of the apex of the anterior cornu, passes through the inner group of large multi- polar pigmentary cells, and, fol- lowing the inner half of the cornu, reaches the anterior com- missure, through which it at- tains the opposite side of the cord, and, turning upwards, be- comes continuous with the longi- tudinal fibres of the anterior columns. The outer fasciculus, the larger of the two, passes through the outer part of the anterior cornu and outer group of large multipolar pigmentary cells, and then curves outwards to become continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the ante- rior part of the lateral column. The posterior roots, after pene- trating the white fibres of the exterior of the cord, collect into small fasciculi, which enter the substantia gelatinosa, and then, divided into fibres, pass into the posterior cornu ; in the poste- rior cornu they separate into two portions, posterior and anterior; the posterior portion bends directly backwards, and becomes con- tinuous with the longitudinal fibres of the posterior columns and posterior part of the lateral columns ; while the anterior portion passes in part outwards to become continuous with the posterior part of the lateral columns, and in part inwards to become continuous with the fibres of the posterior column, and cross into the other half of the cord, constituting the posterior commissure, and thence become continuous with the posterior and lateral columns of the opposite side. In pursuing this course the nerve-fibres become diminished in size, their sheath is more delicate, they are more fragile, and they acquire the property of becoming varicose, and in their finest state they appear to lose their sheath entirely and become reduced to their central axis-cylinder; besides which they * Large nerve cells, with branching processes, from the anterior cornu of the spinal cord; after Kolliker. The pigment granules are collected into a mass in one of the cells; but are more generally distributed in the other.

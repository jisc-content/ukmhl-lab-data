OCCIPITAL BONE. 24 magnum is a groove, for the termination of the lateral sinus; a smooth surface, which forms part of the jugular fossa; and a pro- jecting process, which divides the two, and is called the jugular eminence. Into the jugular fossa will be seen opening the posterior condyloid foramen. The superior borders are strongly serrated, and assist in forming the lambdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bones by means of the additamentum suture lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of Fig. 14* the temporal bone, and the intervening space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The angles of the occipital bone are, the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is * Internal surface of the occipital bone. 1.

698 MAMMAEY GLANDS. lobular divisions, and then goes on gradually, but very slowly, in- creasing in bulk. True gland-vesicles do not make their appear- ance until the period of menstruation, and are not fully developed throughout the entire gland until the first pregnancy. After the period of child-bearing, the gland generally degenerates, the gland - vesicles disappear, and in old age the organ passes into a state of atrophy, the ducts, with their epithelium in a state of fatty dege- neration alone remaining, surrounded by a cushion of fat which takes the place of the glandular tissue. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The inammse are supplied with arteries from the thoracic branches of the axillary, the intercostals, and internal mammary ; having entered the substance of the gland they divide into capillaries, which constitute a close network around the gland-vesicles. The veins form an incomplete circle around the base of the nipple, circuius venosus Halleri, from which larger veins conduct the blood to the circumference of the gland, and by these communications form a plexus on its surface. They ter- minate in the axillary vein, internal mammary, intercostals, and jugular veins. The Lymphatics are abundant in the integument covering the mammae, but have not yet been observed in the structure of the gland; they take the course of the veins, inwards, to the anterior mediastinal glands ; and outwards along the border of the pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The Nerves of the mammary gland are derived from the anterior cutaneous branches of the second, third, and fourth intercostal nerve; and from the lateral cutaneous branches of the same nerves.

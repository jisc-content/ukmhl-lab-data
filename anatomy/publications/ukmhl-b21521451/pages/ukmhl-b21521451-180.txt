164 AKTIC UL ATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. must be recollected in amputation at the tarso-metatarsal articula- tion. The synovial membranes of the tarso-metatarsal articulation are three in number : one for the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; one for the second and third metatarsal bone, which is continuous with the great tarsal synovial membrane; and one for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Actions.—The movements of the metatarsal on the tarsal bones and on each other are very slight; they are such only as contribute to the strength of the foot, by permitting a certain degree of yield- ing to opposing forces. 7. Metatarsophalangeal Articulation.—The ligaments of this articulation, like those between the first phalanges and metacarpal bones of the hand, are, Inferior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The inferior or plantar ligaments, thick and fibrocartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joint. The lateral ligaments, short and very strong, are situated one on each side of the joint. The transverse ligament is a strong band, which passes trans- versely between the plantar ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions.—The movements of the first phalanges on the rounded heads of the metatarsal bones, are flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction. 8. Articulation of the Phalanges.—The ligaments of the pha- langes are the same as those of the fingers, and have the same dis- position ; their actions are also similar. They are, Inferior or plantar, and, Two lateral.

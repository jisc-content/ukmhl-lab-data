339 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Relations.â€”The first portion, on the right side, is in relation, in front, with the internal jugular and vertebral vein, and is crossed by the pneumogastric nerve, phrenic nerve, and one or two branches of the sympathetic. Behind and beneath it is invested by the pleura, is crossed by the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, and is in relation farther back with the sympathetic nerve, longus colli muscle, and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The first por- tion on the left side is in relation in front with the pleura, internal jugular vein, vena innominata, and pneumogastric and phrenic nerve (which lie parallel to it). To its inner side is the left carotid artery, trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct ; to its outer side the pleura ; and behind, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, longus colli, and vertebral column. Plan of the Relations of the first portion of the Right Subclavian Artery. In Front. Internal jugular vein, Vertebral vein, Pneumogastric nerve, Phrenic nerve, Sympathetic filaments. Eight Subclavian Artery. Behind and Beneath. Pleura, Recurrent nerve, Sympathetic nerve, Longus colli muscle, Transverse process of 7th cervical vertebra. Plan of the Relations of the first portion of the Left Subclavian Artery. In Front. Pleura, Internal jugular vein, Vena innominata, Pneumogastric nerve, Phrenic nerve. Inner Side. Left carotid artery, Trachea, (Esophagus, Thoracic duct. Left Subclavian Artery. Outer Side. Pleura. Behind. (Esophagus, Thoracic duet, Longus colli, Vertebral column. The second portion of the artery has the scalenus anticus in front; the scalenus medius and two lower nerves of the brachial plexus behind; the upper nerves of the plexus above, and the pleura below. The scalenus anticus separates it from the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein, which latter is rather below the level of the artery. The third portion of the artery is situated in the subclavian z 2

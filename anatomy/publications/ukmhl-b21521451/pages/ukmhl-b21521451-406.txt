CAVEKNOUS SINUSES. 398 The Lateral sinuses (sinus transversi, vel laterales), commencing at the torcular Herophili, pass horizontally outwards, in the at- tached margin of the tentorium, and then curve downwards and inwards along the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at each side, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they termi- nate in the internal jugular veins. Each sinus rests in its course on the transverse groove of the occipital bone, posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid portion of the temporal, and again on the occipital bone. They receive the cerebral veins from the in- ferior surface of the posterior lobes, the inferior cerebellar veins, superior petrosal sinuses, mastoid and posterior condyloid vein. These sinuses are often unequal in size, the right being larger than the left. The sinuses of the base of the skull are, the Cavernous, Superior petrosal, Inferior petrosal, Transverse. Circular, The Cavernous sinuses are named from pre- senting a structure si- milar to that of the corpus cavernosum pe- nis. They are situated at each side of the sella turcica, receiving, ante- riorly, the ophthalmic veins through the sphe- noidal fissures, and ter- minating posteriorly in the inferior petrosal sinuses. In the caver- nous sinus is the inter- nal carotid artery, seve- ral filaments of the ca- rotid plexus, the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. The ar- tery is separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the lining membrane of * Sinuses of the base of the skull. 1. Ophthalmic veins. 2. Cavernous sinus of one side. 3.

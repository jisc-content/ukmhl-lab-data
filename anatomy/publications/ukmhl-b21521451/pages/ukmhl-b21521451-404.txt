SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 396 of blood iii the sinus. In the infant the direction of these veins is nearly transverse. The Deep or Ventricular veins commence within the lateral ven- tricles by the veins of the corpora striata and those of the choroid plexus, which unite to form the two venae Galeni. The Vence Galeni pass backwards in the structure of the velum interpositum ; and escaping through the fissure of Bichat, terminate in the straight sinus. The Cerebellar veins are disposed, like those of the cerebrum, on the surface of the lobes of the cerebellum ; they are situated, some on the superior, some on the inferior surface, while others occupy the borders of the organ. They terminate in the lateral and petrosal sinuses. SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels formed by the splitting of the layers of that membrane, and lined on their Fig. 168.* inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They may be divided into two groupsâ€”those situated at the upper * Sinuses of the upper and back part of the skull. 1. Superior longitudinal sinus. 2, 2. Cerebral veins opening into the sinus from behind forwards. 3. Falx cerebri. 4. Inferior longitudinal sinus. 5. Straight or fourth sinus. 6. Venae Galeni. 7. Torcular Herophili. 8. The lateral sinuses, with the occipital sinuses between them. 9. The termination of the inferior petrosal sinus of one side. 10. Bulbs of the internal jugular veins, corresponding with the jugular fossa?. 11. Internal jugular veins.

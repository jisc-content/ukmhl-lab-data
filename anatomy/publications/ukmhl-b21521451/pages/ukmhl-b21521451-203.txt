MUSCLES OP THE NECK. 187 The Retrahens attrem (posterior auriculas) arises by two (some- times three) muscular slips from the root of the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Actions.—The actions of the auricular muscles are expressed in their names ; they have but little power in man, but are important muscles in brutes. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups, cor- responding with the natural divisions of the region ; they are, 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Palatine group. 7. Prevertebral group. 8. Laryngeal group. The muscles in each group are ais follow: — 1. Superficial group. PJatysma myoides, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. bncus, Stylo-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Grenio-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus. 4. Muscles of the tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Lingualis, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. 5. Muscles of the pharynx. Constrictor inferior, Constrictor medius, Constrictor superior, Stylo-pharyngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. 6. Muscles of the soft palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos uvulse, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. 7. Prevertebral group. Pectus anticus major, Pectus anticus minor, Scalenus anticus, Scalenus medius, Scalenus posticus, Longus colli. 8. Muscles of the larynx. Crico-thyroideus, Crico-arytsenoideus posticus, Crico-arytaenoideus lateralis, Thyro-arytsenoideus, Arytsenoideus.

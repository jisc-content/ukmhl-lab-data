125 ARTICULATIONS. The joints may be arranged, according to a natural division, into those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. Ligaments op the Trunk.—The articulations of the trunk are divisible into ten groups, namely, 1. Of the vertebral column. 2. Of the atlas, with the occipital bone. 3. Of the axis, with the occipital bone. 4. Of the atlas, with the axis. 5. Of the lower jaw. 6. Of the ribs, with the vertebrae. 7. Of the ribs, with the sternum, and with each other. 8. Of the sternum. 9. Of the vertebral column, with the pelvis. 10. Of the pelvis. 1. Articulation of the Vertebral column. The ligaments con- necting together the different pieces of the vertebral column, admit of the same arrangement as the vertebras themselves. Thus the ligaments Of the bodies, are the Anterior common ligament, Of the transverse processes, Inter-transverse. Bodies.—The Anterior common ligament (fascia longitudinalis anterior) is a broad and riband-like band of ligamentous fibres, ex- tending along the front surface of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the interver- tebral substance, and less closely with the bodies of the vertebrae. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lumbar, and consists of a median and two lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of vessels. The ligament is composed of fibres of various length closely inter- woven with each other ; the deeper and shorter crossing the inter- vertebral substance from one vertebra to the next; the superficial and longer fibres crossing three or four vertebrae. The anterior common ligament is in relation by its posterior or Posterior common ligament, Intervertebral substance. Of the arches, Of the articular processes, Ligamenta subflava. Capsular ligaments, Synovial membranes. Of the spinous processes, Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous.

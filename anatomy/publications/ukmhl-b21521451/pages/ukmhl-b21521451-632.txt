It then passes behind the arch of the aorta and left bronchus, and along the posterior mediastinum, lying in front of the thoracic aorta, to the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, where it enters the abdomen, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach opposite the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra. The oesophagus is flattened and narrow in the cervical region, and cylindrical in the rest of its course ; its largest diameter being met with near the lower part; it is connected by loose areolar tissue to surrounding structures. THE STOMACH. The stomach is an expansion of the alimentary canal, situated in the left hypochondriac and epigastric region, and, for a small extent, in the right hypochondriac region. It is directed somewhat obliquely from above downwards, from left to right, and from * Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum, made in a direction to include the two orifices of the stomach. 1. (Esophagus ; on its internal surface the plicated arrangement of the mucous membrane is shown. 2. Cardiac orifice of the stomach, around which the serrated border of the epithelium is seen. 3. Great end of the stomach. 4. Lesser or pyloric end. 5. Lesser curve. 6. Greater curve. 7. Dilatation at the lesser end of the stomach, the antrum of the pylorus. This may be regarded as the rudiment of a second stomach. 8. Rugse of the stomach formed by the mucous mem- brane : their longitudinal direction is shown. 9. Pylorus. 10. Oblique por- tion of the duodenum. 11. Descending portion. 12. Pancreatic duct and ductus communis choledochus close to their termination. 13. Papilla upon which the ducts open. 14. Transverse portion of duodenum. 15. Commence- ment of jejunum. In the interior of the duodenum and jejunum, the valvulae conniventes are seen.

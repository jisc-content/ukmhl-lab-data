NOTE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION. In presenting an Eighth Edition of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum to the members of the Medical Pro- fession—Students and Practitioners—the Author has not forgotten that we live in a competitive age; and that it becomes^is, not to be content with what we have already done, but to strive to attain, as nearly to perfection as the bonds of human fallibility permit. It has been, as it will always be, the earnest desire of the Author, that the Anatomist's Yade Mecum shall be esteemed worthy of being considered the ready remembrancer of the early studies of the Practitioner, and the patient and faithful guide of the Student. Some new Engravings have been added to this Edition; and the Author has to thank, as heretofore, several friends for their suggestions and contributions. 17, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, January, 1861.

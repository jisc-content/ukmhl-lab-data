515 GENITO-CRURAL NERVE. transversalis muscle, and between tl ternus communicates with the hypo- gastric nerve. It next pierces the obliquus internus, and following the course of the spermatic cord, escapes at the external abdominal ring to be distributed to the scrotum and to the integument of the upper part of the thigh, internally to the saphenous opening; and in the female to that of the pudendum. The GrENiTo-CRURAL nerve pro- ceeds from the second lumbar and by a few filaments from the loop between it and the first. It tra- verses the psoas magnus from be- hind forwards, and runs down the anterior surface of that muscle, lying beneath its fascia, to near Poupart's ligament, where it di- vides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch (n. spermati- ds seu pudendus externus) crosses * A diagram showing the lumbar and sacral plexuses, with the nerves of the lower extremity. 1.

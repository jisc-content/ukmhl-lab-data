TEMPORAL BONE. 30 Development.—By two centres, one for each lateral half. Ossi- fication begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life, frontal suture. The frontal sinuses make their appearance during the first year, and increase in size until old age. Articulations.—With twelve bones : two parietal, sphenoid, eth- moid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To two pairs; corrugator supercilii, and temporal. Temporal Bone.—The temporal bone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The Squamous portion, forming the anterior part of the bone, is thin, translucent, and contains no diploe. On its external surface it is smooth, gives attachment to the fleshy fibres of the temporal * External surface of the temporal bone of the left side. 1. Squamous por- tion. 2. Mastoid portion. 3. Extremity of the petrous portion. 4. The zygoma. 5. Indicates the tubercle of the zygoma, and at the same time its anterior root turning inwards to form the eminentia articularis. 6. Superior root of the zygoma, forming the posterior part of the temporal ridge. 7. Middle root of the zygoma, terminating abruptly at the glenoid fissure. 8. Mastoid foramen. 9. Meatus auditorius externus, surrounded by the processus audi- torius. 10. The digastric fossa, situated immediately to the inner side of (2) the mastoid process. 11. Styloid process. 12. Vaginal process or tympanic lamina. 13. Glenoid or Glaserian fissure; the leading line from this number crosses the rough posterior portion of the glenoid fossa. 14. The opening and part of the groove for the Eustachian tube. Fig. 19*

220 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The muscles of opposite sides acting together, draw the head directly backwards. They are direct antagonists of the sterno-mastoid. muscles. The sacro-lumbalis with its accessory muscle, the longissimus dorsi and spinalis dorsi, are known by the general term of erector spinas, which sufficiently expresses their action. They keep the spine supported in the vertical position by their broad origin from below, and by their insertion, by distinct tendons, into the ribs and spinous processes. Being made up of a number of distinct fasci- culi, which act alternately, the spine is kept erect without fatigue, even when the muscles have to counterbalance a corpulent abdo- men. The continuations upwards of these muscles into the neck preserve the steadiness and uprightness of that region. When the muscles of one side act alone, the neck is rotated on its axis. The complexus, being attached to the occipital bone, draws the head backwards, and counteracts the muscles of the anterior part of the neck. It assists also in the rotation of the head. The semi-spinalis and mullificlus spina muscles act directly on the vertebra?, and contribute to the general action of supporting the vertebral column erect. The four little muscles situated between the occiput and the first two vertebrae, effect the various movements between these bones ; the recti producing the antero-posterior actions ; the obliqui the rotatory motions of the atlas on the axis. The actions of the remaining muscles of the spine, the inter- spinales and inter-transversales, are expressed in their names. They approximate their attachments and assist the more powerful muscles in preserving the erect position of the body. The levatores costarum raise the posterior parts of the ribs, and are probably more serviceable in preserving the articulation of the ribs from displacement, than in raising them in inspiration.

LATERAL REGION OP THE SKULL. 58 and zygoma, and lodges the temporal muscle with the deep temporal arteries and nerves. The mastoid portion is rough, for the attachment of muscles. On its posterior part is the mastoid foramen ; and below, the mas- toid process. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory foramen, surrounded by the external auditory process ; and in front of this foramen the glenoid cavity, bounded above by the middle root of the zygoma, and in front by its tubercle. Fig. 37.* The zygomatic portion, or fossa, is the irregular cavity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior maxillary bone, internally by the external pterygoid plate, above by part of the great wing of the sphenoid, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and temporal fossa ; and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower * Front view of the skull. 1.

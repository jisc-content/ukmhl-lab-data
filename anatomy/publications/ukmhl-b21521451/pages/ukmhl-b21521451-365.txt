ULNAR ARTERY. 355 in by th-. oalmaris brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accom- panied in i's course by the venae comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two-thirds of its extent; the nerve lying to its ulnar side. Plan of the Relations of the Ulnar Artery. In Front. Deep fascia, Superficial layer of muscles, Median nerve. In the Sand. Tendinous arch from the pisiform bone, Palmaris brevis muscle, Palmar fascia. Inner Side. Flexor carpi ulnaris, Ulnar nerve (lower two-thirds). Ulnar Artery. Outer Side. Flexor sublimis digi- torum. Behind. Brachialis anticus, Flexor profundus digitorum, Pronator quadratus. In the Sand. Annular ligament. Tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum. The Branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged, like those of the radial, into three groups : / Anterior ulnar recurrent, Posterior ulnar recurrent, Forearm, \ T , \ Anterior interosseous, Interosseous, j interosseous; I Muscular. !Carpea anterior, Carpea posterior, tt j j Communicating, Metacarpea. nana> \ Digitales. The Anterior ulnar recurrent, arising immediately below the elbow, ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and brachialis anticus ; it distributes branches to the adjacent muscles, and inosculates with the anastomotica magna and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by a com- mon trunk. The Posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the preceding, arises immediately below the elbow-joint, and passes backwards, beneath the origin of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends A a 2

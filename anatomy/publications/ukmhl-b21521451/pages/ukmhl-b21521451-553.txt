CHOROID COAT. 545 line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, by a dense white struc- ture, the ciliary ligament, which surrounds the circumference of the iris like a ring. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers :â€”an external or venous layer, which consists principally of veins arranged in a peculiar manner : hence they have been named venos vorticosce. The marking on the surface of the membrane produced by these veins resembles so many centres to which a number of curved lines converge. It is this layer which is connected with the ciliary liga- ment. The middle or arterial layer (tunica Ruyschiana)* is formed principally by the ramifications of minute arteries. It is reflected inwards at its junction with the ciliary ligament, so as to form the ciliary processes. The internal layer is a delicate membrane (membrana pigmenti) composed of several laminae of nucleated 3 hexagonal cells, which contain the granules of pigmentum nigrum, and are arranged like the tiles of a tesselated pavement. * Kuysch was bom at the Hague in 1638, and was appointed Professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665. His whole life was employed in making in- jected preparations, for which he is justly celebrated, and he died at the advanced age of ninety-three years; having come to the conclusion that the body was entirely made up of vessels. t Dissection of the eyeball, showing its second tunic, and the mode of dis- tribution of the venae vorticosa? of the choroid; after Arnold.

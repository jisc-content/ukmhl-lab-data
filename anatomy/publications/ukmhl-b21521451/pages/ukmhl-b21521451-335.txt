ARTERIA INNOMINATA. 323 inosculates with the right coronary, forming an arterial circle around the base of the heart; the other (anterior) passes along the groove of union of the two ventricles, on the anterior aspect of the heart, to its apex, where it anastomoses with the right coronary. The left coronary artery supplies the left auricle and anterior surface of both ventricles. The right coronary (coronaria cordis dextra) passes forwards, between the root of the pulmonary artery and the right auricle, and winds along the auriculo-ventricular groove, to the posterior longi- tudinal furrow ; it then descends along the posterior aspect of the heart to its apex, and inosculates with the left coronary. It is dis- tributed to the right auricle and ventricle, and posterior surface of both ventricles, and sends a large branch along the sharp margin of the right ventricle to the apex of the heart. The Arteria innominata (Fig. 150, 4) is the first and largest artery given off by the arch of the aorta. It is an inch and a half in iength, and ascends obliquely towards the right sterno-clavicular articulation, where it divides into the right carotid and right sub- clavian artery. Relations.â€”It is in relation, in front, with the left vena inno- minata, sternum, and origin of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscle ; behind, with the trachea and right pneumogastric nerve ; to the right, with the right vena innominata and pleura ; to the left, with the left common carotid artery and remains of the thymus gland.

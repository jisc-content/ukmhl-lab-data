BASE OP THE SKULL. 62 Passing inwards from these foramina is the transverse ridge, to which are attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor palati muscles; and at the middle line of the posterior border, the palate spine, which gives origin to the azygos uvulas. The hard palate is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four processes of which it is composed. Behind, and above the hard palate, are the posterior nares, separated by the "vomer, and bounded at each side by Fig. 39 * * External or basilar surface of the base of the skull. 1,1. The hard palate. The figures are placed on the palate processes of the superior maxillary-bones. 2. Incisive, or anterior palatine foramen. 3. Palate process of the palate bone. The large opening near the figure is the posterior palatine foramen. .4. Palate spine; the curved line upon which the cipher rests is the transverse ridge. 5. Vomer, dividing the openings of the posterior nares. 6. Internal pterygoid plate. 7. Scaphoid fossa. 8. External pterygoid plate. The interval between 6 and 8 (right side of the figure) is the pterygoid fossa. 9. Zygomatic fossa. 10. Basilar process of the occipital bone. 11. Foramen magnum. 12. Foramen ovale. 13. Foramen spinosum. 14. Glenoid fossa. 15. Meatus auditorius externus. 16. Foramen lacerum anterius basis cranii. 17. The carotid foramen of the left side. 18. Foramen lacerum posterius, or jugular foramen. 19. Styloid process. 20. Stylo-mastoid foramen. The elevation just to the right of the cipher is the jugular tubercle; and the groove to its left the digastric fossa. 21. Mastoid process. 22. One of the condyles of the occipital bone. 23. Posterior condyloid fossa.

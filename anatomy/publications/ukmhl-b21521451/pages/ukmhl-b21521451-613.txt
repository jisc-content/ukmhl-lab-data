605 THE LUNGS. reversed ; but on the left side, the bronchus has to stoop beneath the arch of the aorta, which alters its position to the vessels. They are thus disposed on the two sides:â€” !Bronchus, ( Artery, Artery, Left, < Bronchus, Veins. ( Veins. The special relations of the roots of the lung are, for the right, the descending cava, which lies in front, and the vena azygos, which arches over it from behind to terminate in the superior vena cava. The root of the left lung has the descending aorta lying behind it. * Heart and lungs. 1.

FRONTAL BONE. 28 plete the ethmoidal cells ; and, crossing these edges transversely, are two small grooves, sometimes canals, which open into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramen. At the anterior termination of these edges are the irregular openings which lead into the frontal sinuses ; and between the two internal angular processes is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a project- ing process, the nasal spine. On each orbital plate, immediately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which Fig. 17.* 10 lodges the lachrymal gland ; and beneath the internal angular pro- cess a small pit, sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle is attached. Internal Surface.â€” Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri, the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid bone, the foramen ccecum. This opening lodges a process of the dura mater, and occasionally gives passage to a small * External surface of the frontal bone. 1. Situation of the frontal eminence of the right side. 2.

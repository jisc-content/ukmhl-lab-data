Action.—To raise the eyebrows, thereby throwing the integu- ment of the forehead into transverse wrinkles. Some persons have I the power of moving the entire scalp on the pericranium by means j of these muscles. Fig. 107.* V \ 2. Orbital Group. Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, Tensor tarsi.

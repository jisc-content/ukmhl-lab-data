558 TYMPANUM. forwards from the concha to the tympanum. It is narrower in the middle than at each extremity, forms an oval cylinder, the long diameter being vertical, and is slightly curved on itself, the con- cavity looking downwards. It is lined by an extremely thin pouch of epithe- lium, which, when withdrawn after maceration, pre- serves the form of the meatus. Some stiff short hairs are also found in its interior, which' stretch across the tube, and prevent the ingress of in- sects and dust. In the substance of its lining mem- brane are a num- ber of ceruminous glands, which se- crete the wax of the ear. Vessels & Nerves. The pinna is plen- tifully supplied with arteries ; by the anterior auri- cular from the temporal, by the posterior auricular from the ex- ternal carotid, and by a branch from the occipital artery. Its Nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal of the fifth, the posterior auricular of the facial, and the auricularis magnus of the cervical plexus. Middle ear or tympanum.â€”The tympanum is an irregular bony cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is bounded externally by the meatus and mem- brana tympani; internally, by the base of the petrous bone; behind, * The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind; after Arnold. 1,1.

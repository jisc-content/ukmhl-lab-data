STERNOCLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. 141 1. Sterno-clavicular Articulation.â€”The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial articulation ; its ligaments are, Anterior sterno-clavicular, Inter-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Costo-clavicular (rhomboid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad ligamentous layer, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, and covering the anterior aspect of the articulation. This ligament is in relation by its anterior surface with the integument and sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and behind with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and synovial membranes. The posterior-sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad band cover- ing the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and syno- vial membranes ; and behind, with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscle. i The anterior and posterior ligaments are continuous at the upper and lower part of the articulation, so as to form a capsule around the joint. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely adherent to the upper border of the sternum. It is separated by cellular tissue from the sterno-thyroid muscles. The costo-clavicular ligament (rhomboides) is a thick fasciculus of fibres, connecting the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the * Ligaments of the sterno-clavicular and costo-sternal articulations. 1. An- terior sterno-clavicular ligament. 2. Inter-clavicular ligament. 3. Costo- clavicular or rhomboid ligament; seen on both sides. 4. Interarticular fibro- cartilage, brought into view by the removal of the anterior and posterior liga- ments. 5. Anterior costo-sternal ligaments of the first and second rib.

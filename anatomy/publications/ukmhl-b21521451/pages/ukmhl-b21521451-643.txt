635 STRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. cliately beneath it, the areolar tissue is in its amorphous and undeveloped condition ; the limitary portion is transparent and structureless, while that immediately beneath it is a transparent matrix containing nuclei and undeveloped cells. The papillae and villi are formed of this material, but have also entering into their structure, smooth muscular fibre and blood-vessels. The smooth muscular fibre forms a thin layer in the deep portion of the mucous membrane in contact with the submucous coat, and is more developed in animals than in man. In the alimentary canal, the surface of the mucous layer presents some diversity of ap- pearance, having reference to the mode of arrangement of the limitary membrane. Thus in the stomach it is raised into a deli- cate network, the minute openings included within the frame of the network being termed alveoli, and this form of mucous mem- brane alveolar. The alveolar mucous membrane is also found in the large intestine, where the alveoli are smaller and the septa thicker than those of the stomach ; in the vesicuke seminales, * Portion of the raucous membrane of the small intestine, magnified 19 times, showing conical villi. In the hollows between the villi are seen the apertures of simple follicles (b) ■ and near the bottom of the figure is a zone of follicles (a), surrounding what has been described as a solitary gland. These villi measured J5 of an inch in length, by ^ in breadth at the base, and from T-|T to Tf „ of an inch near the summit. t Portion of the mucous membrane of the jejunum, lying between the valvula? conniventes, magnified 19 times, and showing the lamellated and convoluted form of villi; the breadth of the lamellse is ^ of an inch.

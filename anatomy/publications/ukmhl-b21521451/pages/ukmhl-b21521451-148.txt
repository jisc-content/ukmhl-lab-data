132 LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. scribed are three in number ; to which may be added, as appertain- ing to the mechanism of the joint, an interarticular fibrous-cartilage and two synovial membranes, thus : â€” External lateral, Capsular, Internal lateral, Interarticular fibrous cartilage, Two synovial membranes. Fig. 80.* The external lateral j / ligament is a short and thick band of fibres, passing obliquely back- wards from the tu- bercle of the zygoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. It is in relation, externally, with the integument of the face; internally, with the two synovial mem- branes of the articu- lation and the interarticular cartilage. The external lateral ligament acts conjointly with its fellow of the opposite condyle in the move- ments of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament (spheno-maxillary) has no connexion with, the articulation of the lower jaw, and is, therefore, incorrectly named; it is a thin aponeu- Fig. 81.t rotic expansion extending from the extremity of the spinous process of the sphe- noid bone to the margin of the dental foramen ; and is piei'ced at its insertion by the mylo-hyoidean nerve. Between the internal lateral ligament and neck of the jaw is a triangular space, in which are situated the internal max- illary artery, auriculotem- poral nerve, inferior dental artery and nerve, and part * External view of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1.

CORPUS CALLOSUM. 450 where it comes in contact with the corpus callosum, is bounded by a large convolution (gyrus fornicatus) which lies horizontally on that body, and may be traced forwards and backwards to the base of the brain, terminating by each extremity at the fissure of Sylvius. The sulcus between this convolution and the corpus callosum has been termed the " ventricle of the corpus callosum," and some longitu- dinal fibres (strise longitudinales laterales), which are brought into view when the convolution is raised, were called by Rett the " covered band." If the upper part of each hemisphere be re- moved to a level with the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medullary matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey-substance corresponding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemi- spheres, will be seen; this is the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens. The Corpus callosum (callosus, hard) is a thick layer of medullary fibres passing transversely between the two hemispheres, and con- stituting their great commissure (trabs cerebri, beam of the brain). * Section of the brain showing the centrum ovale majus and corpus callo- sum. 1,1.

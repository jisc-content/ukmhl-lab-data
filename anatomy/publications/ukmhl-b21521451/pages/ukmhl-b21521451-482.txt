OLFACTORY NERVE. 474 white streak along the fissure of Sylvius into the middle lobe, where it is continuous with the fibres of the anterior commissure and the exterior white substance of the thalamus opticus. The nervous cord formed by the union of the three roots is soft in tex- ture, prismoid in shape, and embedded in a sulcus between two convolutions on the under surface of each anterior lobe of the brain, lying between the pia mater aud arachnoid. As it passes forward Fig. 190.* it increases in breadth and swells at its extremity into an oblong mass of grey and white substance, the bulbus olfactorius, which * Olfactory nerve, with its distribution on the septum nasi. The nares have been divided by a longitudinal section made immediately to the left of the septum, the right naris being preserved entire. 1. Frontal sinus. 2. Nasal bone. 3. Crista galli process of ethmoid bone. 4. Sphenoidal sinus of left side. 5. Sella turcica. 6. Basilar process of sphenoid and occipital bone. 7. Posterior opening of the right naris. 8. Opening of the Eustachian tube in the upper part of the pharynx. 9. Soft palate divided through its middle. 10. Cut surface of the hard palate, a. Olfactory nerve, b. Its three roots of origin, c. Its bulb, from which the filaments are seen to proceed which spread out in the substance of the pituitary membrane, d. Nasal nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic, descending into the left naris from the anterior foramen of the cribriform plate, and dividing into its external and internal branch, e. Naso-palatine nerve, a branch from the spheno-palatine ganglion, distributing twigs to the mucous membrane of the septum nasi in its course to (f) the anterior palatine foramen, g. Branches of the naso-palatine nerve to the palate, h. Anterior and posterior palatine nerves, i. Septum nasi.

633 EPITHELIUM.—SPHEEOIDAL AND CILIATED. Each column contains near its middle a nucleus, which gives it a swollen appearance, and the nucleus possesses one or more nucleoli; from the transparency of the column the nucleus may ^ig. 240/ be seen through its base. The columnar epithelium occurs in the stomach and bowels, urethra, gall-blad- der, and ducts of glands. In the gall-bladder the nu- cleus is less apparent than in other parts. The Spheroidal epithelium is composed of cells, which^ are spheroidal in shape, and more or less polyhedral from compression ; in other respects they resemble in structure the cells of the preceding varieties. They are found in situations where the squamous and columnar epithelium are continuous, and on that account have been named by Henle transitional epithe- lium. ' The spheroidal epithelium also occurs in the excretory passages of the kidney, the bladder, and in the excretory ducts of the glands which open on the mucous membrane and skin. The Ciliated epithelium is characterized by the presence of minute conical vibratile filaments (cilia) mounted on the broad ends of the columnar cells, or upon the free surface of those of the spheroidal kind. The cilia are in constant action, and produce a wave-like motion, which Fig. Fig.243 Fig. 244. carries the secretions in contact with them towards the outlet of the organ in which they exist. They are found in the nose, and sinuses communicating with the nose ; in the nasal duct; upper or respira- * Columnar epithelium from the small intestine: after Henle.

304 PERINEAL FASCIA. scrotum, or cellular tissue of the labia majora, in front, with the superficial fascia of the thighs at each side, and with the superficial fascia covering the glutei maximi and with the coccyx behind. The deep layer ox proper perineal fascia (fascia perinei superfi- cialis) is divisible into two portions, anterior and posterior, the former investing the muscles of the perineum, the other the ischio- rectal fossa. The anterior portion (fascia ischio-pubica, Velpeau) is a thin aponeurotic layer which covers in the muscles of the geni- tal region of the perineum and the root of the penis. It is firmly t attached at each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; pos- teriorly it is reflected upwards behind the transversi perinei muscles to become continuous with the deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament; while, in front it is continuous with the dartos in the male, and is lost in the labia majora and nymphse in the female. The continuation of the perineal fascia into the triangular ligament along the posterior border of the transversi perinei muscles, is a barrier to the extension of extravasation of urine backwards, and Fig. 143* * The pubic arch and perineal fasciae. 1,1,1. The superficial perinea fascia divided by a a shaped incision into three flaps; the lateral flaps are turned over the ramus of the pubes and ischium at each side, to which they are firmly attached; the posterior flap is continuous with the deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament. 2. The triangular ligament of Camper. 3. Open- ing for the passage of the membranous portion of the urethra, previously to the entrance of the latter into the bulb. 4. Two projections of the triangular ligament corresponding with the position of Cowper's glands.

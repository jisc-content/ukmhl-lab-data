SACRUM. 19 sacral nerves. The projection of the superior piece is the sacro- vertebral angle or promontory. The posterior surface is narrower than the anterior, and convex. On the middle line is a rough crest formed by the rudiments of four spinous processes, the fifth remaining undeveloped and exposing the lower termination of the sacral canal. Immediately external to and parallel with the median crest, is a range of five small tubercles which represent the articular processes of the true vertebrae ; beyond these is a shallow groove in which the four posterior Fig. 11.* sacral foramina open, and farther outwards, a range of five tubercles corre- sponding with the poste- rior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The lowest pair of articular tubercles bound on each side the termination of the sacral canal, and send each a process downwards to articulate with the coc- cyx. The two descending processes are the sacral cornua. The posterior sa- cral foramina are smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior sa- cral nerves. Of the pos- terior transverse tubercles the first corresponds with the angle of the superior border of the bone ; the second is small, and enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac articulation ; the third is large, and gives attachment to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament; the fourth and fifth are smaller, and serve for the attachment of the saero-ischiatic ligaments. The lateral border of the sacrum presents superiorly a broad and are attached. 6. The vertebral articular surface. 7.

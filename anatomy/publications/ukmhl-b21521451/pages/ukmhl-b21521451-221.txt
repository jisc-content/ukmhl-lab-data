205 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. colli, flex and rotate the head and the cervical portion of the verte- bral column. The scaleni muscles are flexors of the vertebral column ; and, acting from above, fix the first and second ribs for the inspiratory muscles. Eighth Group.—Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Chapter X. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the trunk may be subdivided into four natural groups : viz., 1. Muscles of the back. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perinseuni. 1. Muscles of the Bach.—The region of the bach, inconsequence of its extent, is common to the neck, upper extremities, and abdo- men : and its muscles, which are numerous, may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulas, Rhomboideus minor, Rhomboideus major. Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior, Serratus posticus inferior, Splenius capitis, Splenius colli. Fourth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Sacro-lumbalis, Longissimus dorsi, Spinalis dorsi. (Cervical Group.) Cervicalis ascendens, Transversalis cervicis, Trachelo-mastoideus, Complexus. Fifth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Semi-spinalis dorsi, Semi-spinalis colli. (Cervical Group.) Rectus posticus major, Rectus posticus minor, Rectus lateralis, Obliquus inferior, Obliquus superior. Sixth Layer. Multifidus spinse, Inter-spinales, Inter-transversales, Levatores costarum. First Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of this layer are to be dissected by making an incision along the middle line of the back, from the

242 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. the cylinder of the intestine. The use of the levator ani is expressed in its name; it is the antagonist of the diaphragm and abdominal expulsory muscles, and serves to support the rectum and vagina during their expulsive efforts. The levator ani acts in unison with the diaphragm, and rises and falls like that muscle in forcible re- spiration. Yielding to the propulsive action of the abdominal muscles, it enables the outlet of the pelvis to bear a greater force than a resisting structure, and, on the remission of such action, restores the perineum to its original form. The coccygei and sacro-coccygei muscles restore the coccyx to its natural position, after it has been pressed backwards during defeecation or parturition. Dr. Barclay styles the levatores ani, transversi perinei, sphinc- teres ani, coccygei and curvatores coccygis, moderator muscles, " which, after moderating the motor muscles, become motor muscles themselves ; and, acting successively in compressing the rectum, expel any remains of the faeces that may be lodged, towards the ex- tremity of the canal."

309 FEMORAL HERNIA. subserous cellular tissue,* which retains the lymphatic gland in its position, and is named septum crurale, and by the peritoneum. It follows from this description that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the parietes of the abdomen, particularly in the female, in whom the femoral arch, or space included between Poupart's liga- ment and the border of the pelvis, is larger than in the male, while the structures which pass through it are smaller. It happens, consequently, that if violent or continued pressure be made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced through the femoral ring into the infundibuliform space in the sheath of the femoral vessels, carrying before it the peritoneum and septum crurale,â€”this constitutes femoral hernia. If the causes which * This cellular tissue is sometimes very considerably thickened by a deposit of fat within its areolse, and forms a thick stratum over the hernial sac. t Section of the structures which pass beneath the femoral arch. 1. Pou- part's ligament. 2, 2. Iliac portion of the fascia lata, attached along the margin of the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's ligament, as far as the spine of the pubes (3). 4. Pubic portion of the fascia lata, continuous at 3 with the iliac portion, and passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels to its outer border at 5, where it divides into two layers; one is con- tinuous with the sheath of the psoas (6), and iliacus (7); the other (8) is lost upon the capsule of the hip-joint (9). 10. The crural nerve enclosed in the sheath of the psoas and iliacus. 11. Gimbernat's ligament. 12. The femoral ring, within the femoral sheath. 13. Femoral vein. 14. Femoral artery; the two vessels and the ring are surrounded by the femoral sheath, and thin septa are sent between the anterior and posterior wall of the sheath, dividing the artery from the vein, and the vein from the femoral ring.

Ossification of the bodies, on the contrary, commences at the centre, and proceeds from that point towards the extremities of the column; hence imper- fection of the bodies occurs either in the upper or lower vertebrae. Attachment of Muscles.â€”To the atlas are attached nine pairs of muscles; the longus colli, rectus anticus minor, rectus lateralis, rectus posticus minor, obliquus superior and inferior, splenius colli, levator-anguli scapulas, and first intertransversales. To the axis are attached eleven pairs ; viz., longus colli, inter- transversales, obliquus inferior, rectus posticus major, interspinals, semi-spinalis colli, multifidus spinas, levator anguli scapulae, splenius colli, transversalis cervicis, and scalenus medius. To the remaining vertebras collectively, thirty-one pairs and one single muscle ; viz., posteriorly, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major, serratus posticus superior and inferior, splenius, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, transversalis cervicis, trachelo- mastoideus, complexus, semispinalis dorsi and colli, multifidus spinas, interspinales, intertransversales, levatores costarum : ante- riorly, rectus anticus major, longus colli, scalenus anticus, medius, and posticus, psoas magnus, psoas parvus, quadratus lumborum, diaphragm, obliquus internus and transversalis. The Sacrum is a triangular bone, situated at the lower extremity of the vertebral column, and formed by the consolidation of five false vertebras. It is divi- * The sacrum seen upon its anterior surface. 1, 1. Transverse lines mark- ing the original constitution of the bone of four pieces. 2, 2. Anterior sacral foramina. 3.

At the ex- tremities of these lines, on each side, are the four anterior sacral foramina, which diminish in size from above downwards, and transmit the anterior

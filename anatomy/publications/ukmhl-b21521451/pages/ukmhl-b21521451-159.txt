143 LIGAMENTS OP THE SCAPULA. synovial membranes are thin; and when the fibro-cartilage is in- complete, there is but one. Fig. 87.* A ctions. â€” The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two movements, gliding of the surfaces on each other, and rotation of the scapula on the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are, Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament (triangulare) is a broad and thick triangular band, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion proeess, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle ; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually interposed. The transverse or coracoid ligament (supra-scapulare) is a narrow * Ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1. Superior acromio-clavi- cular ligament. 2.

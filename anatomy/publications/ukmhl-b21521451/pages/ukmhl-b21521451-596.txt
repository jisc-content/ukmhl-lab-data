ANATOMY OP THE HEART. 588 The Pulmonary veins, two from the right and two from the left lung, open into the corresponding sides of the auricle. The two left pulmonary veins terminate frequently by a common opening. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture of communi- cation between the auricle and ventricle. The Musculi pectinati are fewer in number than in the right auricle, and are situated only in the appendix auriculae. Left Ventricle.â€”The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculorum, and con- tinuing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. The left ventricle is conical both in external figure and in the shape of its internal cavity. It forms the apex of the heart, by projecting beyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the advantage in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven * Anatomy of the heart; left side. 1. Cavity of left auricle.

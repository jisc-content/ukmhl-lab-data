557 MEATUS AUDITORIUS. The Transversus auriculce, partly tendinous 'and partly muscular, extends transversely from the convexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the pinna. The Obliquus auris (Tod) is a small band of fibres passing be- tween the upper part of the convexity of the concha and the con- vexity immediately above it. The Dilatator concha? is a thin band of muscular fibres which crosses the fissure between the cartilage of the meatus and tragus on its anterior aspect. Todf describes, besides, a contractor meatus, or trago-helicus muscle. The Meatus auditoeius is a canal, partly cartilaginous and partly osseous, about an inch in length, which extends inwards and a little * The pinna and its muscles; after Arnold.' 1,1. Helix. 2.

540 NASAL FOSSAE. is prolonged backwards and downwards in the direction of the terior border of the ala by three or four small fibro-cartilagh plates (sesamoid cartilages, cartilagines ininores), which are pendages of the alar fibro-cartilage. Its Nerves are, the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasal fossce are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded superiorly by the lateral cartilages of the nose, and by the nasal bones, ethmoid, and sphenoid ; inferiorly, by the hard palate; and, in the middle line, they are separated by a bony and fibro-cartila- ginous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossse will be found at page 65. On the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three projecting processes, termed spongy bones. The two superior belong to the ethmoid, the inferior is a separate bone. In the * The fibro-cartilages and bones of the nose viewed from the side; after Arnold. 1. Nasal bone. 2.

The whole of these fibro- cartilages are connected with each other, and to the bones, by perichondrium, which, from its membranous struc- ture, permits of the freedom of motion existing between them. 5. The Mucous membrane lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossaa within. Around the entrance of the nostrils it is provided with the vi- brissa. 6.

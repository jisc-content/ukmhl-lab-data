Dissection.â€”The subject being turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the pubes to support the pelvis, tbe student com- mences the dissection of this region, by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous process ; or vice versd, if he be on the left side. He then makes an incision from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, to the apex of the trochanter major, this marks the upper border of the gluteus maximus; and a third incision from the apex of the coccyx along the fleshy margin of the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to the outer side of the thigh, about four inches below the apex of the trochanter major. He then reflects the in- tegument, superficial fascia, and deep fascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus maximus, following rigidly the course of its fibres ; and having exposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and superficial fascia from off

704 THYMUS GLAND. The Lobules, somewhat more than a quarter of an inch in diameter, of a rounded and pyriform shape, are composed of smaller Fig. 277* lobules, and the smaller lobules, which are hollow in the interior, are made up of small round or polygonal solid masses, the gland granules or acini. The gland granules, separate externally, are adherent by their inner borders, and enclose the cavity of the smaller lobule, the 1' secretory cell;" the secretory cells open into the "pouch" or cavity of the lobules, and the pouches of the lobules open into the central canal or cavity, " the reservoir of the thymus." The substance of the thymus is contained in the gland granules, of which the walls of the organ are constructed ; this substance is of a greyish-white colour, soft, about a quarter of a line in thick- ness, and placed between two membranes, a thin fibrous, almost homogeneous membrana propria externally, which invests each separate lobule, and is continued over the entire gland ; and a thin vascular membrane internally, consisting of a plexus of blood- vessels held together by a small quantity of areolar tissue. The proper substance of the gland is composed of cells, free nuclei, * Section of the thymus gland at the eighth month. This figure, and the succeeding, were drawn with the kind permission of Sir Astley Cooper from two of his preparations. The references were made by Sir Astley himself. 1. Cervical portions of the gland; the independence of the two lateral glands is shown. 2. Secretory cells seen on the cut surface of the section; these are observed in all parts of the section. 3,3. Pores or openings of the secretory cells and pouches; they are seen dispersed on the whole internal surface of the great central cavity or reservoir. " The continuity of the reservoir in the lower or thoracic portion of the gland, with the cervical portion, is seen in the figure.

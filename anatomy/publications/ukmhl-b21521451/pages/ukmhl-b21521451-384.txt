FEMORAL ARTERY. 376 slieatli to make their way to a gland, crural ring. situated in the femoral or Relations. â€” The upper. third of the femoral artery- is superficial, being Covered only by the integument,-in- guinal glands, and superfi- cial and deep fascia. The lower two-thirds are covered by the sartorius muscle. To its outer side the artery is in relation with the psoas, and vastus internus. Be- hind, it rests on the inner border of the psoas ; it is next separated from the pectineus by the femoral vein, profunda vein and artery, and then lies on the adductor longus to its ter- mination ; near the lower border of the adductor longus it is placed in an aponeurotic sheath or canal, formed by an arch of ten- dinous fibres, thrown from the border of the adductor longus and the border of the opening in the adductor * Anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, with the femoral artery. 1. Lower part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle; its inferior margin is Poupart's ligament. 2. Exter- nal abdominal ring. 3, 3. Upper and lower part of the sartorius muscle; its middle portion being removed. 4. Rectus. 5. Vastus internus. 6. Patella. 7. Iliacus and psoas; the latter being nearest the artery. 8. Pec- tineus. 9. Adductor longus. 10. Tendinous canal for the femoral artery formed by the adductor magnus, and vastus internus. 11. Ad- ductor magnus. 12. Gracilis. 13. Tendon of the semi-tendinosus. 14. Fe- moral artery. 15. Superficial circumflexa ilii artery, taking its course along the line of Poupart's ligament, to the crest of the ilium. 2. Superficial epi- gastric artery. 16. The two external pudic arteries, superior and inferior. 17. Profunda artery, giving off, 18, its external circumflex branch; and lower down the three perforantes. A small bend of the internal circumflex artery (8) is seen behind the inner margin of the femoral, just below the inferior external pudic artery. 19.

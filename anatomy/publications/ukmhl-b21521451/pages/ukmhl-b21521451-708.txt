FCETAL CIRCULATION. 700 Fig. 276. nicates with the portal vein in the transverse fissure, and supplies the right lobe ; and a large branch, the ductus venosus, passes directly backwards, and joins the inferior vena cava. In the inferior cava the pure blood becomes mixed with that which is returning from the lower extremi- ties and abdominal vis- cera, and is carried through the right auricle (guided by the Eustachian |T I valve) and through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed by means of the carotid and sub- clavian arteries, princi- pally to the head and upper extremities. From the head and upper ex- tremities, the impure blood is returned by the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle, it is pro- pelled into the right ven- tricle ; and from the right ventricle into the pul- monary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be circulated through the lungs and oxyge- nated ; but in the foetus the lungs are solid, and u u * Foetal circulation. 1. Umbilical cord, consisting of umbilical vein and two umbilical arteries; proceeding from the placenta (2). 3. Umbilical vein, dividing into branches; two (4, 4), to be distributed to the liver; and one (5), the ductus venosus, which enters the inferior vena cava (6). 7. Portal vein, returning the blood from the intestines, and communicating with the right hepatic- branch. 8. Eight auricle; the course of the blood is denoted by the arrow, proceeding from 8, to 9, the left auricle. 10. Left ventricle; the blood following the arrow to the arch of the aorta (11), to be distributed through the branches given off by the arch to the head and upper extremities. The

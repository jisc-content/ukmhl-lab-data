13 VERTEBRA PROMINENS. to articulate with the anterior arch of the atlas; the other on its posterior face, for the transverse ligament; the latter surface eonstricts the base of the process, which has given rise to the term neck applied to this part. Upon each side of its apex is a rough depression, for the attach- ment of the alar ligaments; and running down from its base, on the anterior surface of the body of the vertebra, a vertical ridge, with a depression at each side for the at- tachment of the longus colli muscle. The laminae are large and strong, and unite posteriorly to form a long and bifid spinous process, which is concave beneath. The transverse processes are rudimentary, not bifid, and project only so far as to enclose the vertebral foramen, which is directed obliquely outwards instead of perpendicularly as in the other vertebras. The superior articu- lating processes are situated on the body of the vertebra, at each side of the odontoid process. They are circular and nearly horizontal, having a slight inclination outwards. The inferior articulating processes look downwards and forwards, as do the same processes in the other cervical vertebras. The superior intervertebral notch is remarkably shallow, and lies behind the articular process as in the atlas. The lower surface the body is convex, and is received into the concavity upon the upper surface of the third vertebra. The Vertebra prominens, or seventh cervical, approaches in cha- racter the upper dorsal vertebras. It has received its designation from having a very long spinous process, which is single and termi- nated by a tubercle, and forms a projection on the back part of the neck; to the extremity of this process the ligamentum nuchas is attached. The transverse processes are but slightly grooved along the upper surface, have each a small foramen for the transmission of the vertebral vein, and present only a rudimentary bifurcation at their extremity. Sometimes the anterior tubercle represents a small but distinct rib.

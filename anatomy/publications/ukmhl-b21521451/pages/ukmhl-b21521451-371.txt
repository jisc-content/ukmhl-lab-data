The Gastro-epiploica dextra runs along the great curve of the stomach lying between the two layers of the great omentum, and inosculates at about its middle with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. It supplies the greater curve of the stomach and great omentum ; hence its name. The Pancreatico-duodenalis curves along the fixed border of the Fig. 157* * Branches of the coeliae axis. L Liver. 2.

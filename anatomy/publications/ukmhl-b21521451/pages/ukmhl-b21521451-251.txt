ACCELERATORS URIN2E.—TRANSVERSUS PERINEI. 237 posterior and middle insertions of these muscles are best seen by carefully raising one muscle from the corpus spongiosum and tracing its fibres. Relations.—By tbeir superficial surface with, the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, superficial vessels and nerves of the perineum, and, on each side, the erector penis. By their deep surface with the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra. The Erector penis (ischio-cavernosus) arises from the tuberosity of the ischium and from the ramus of the pubes on each side of the crus, and curves around the root of the penis ; to be inserted into the upper surface of the corpus cavernosum, where it is continuous with a strong fascia which covers the dorsum of the organ, the fascia penis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, and superficial perineal vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the corpus cavernosum penis. Fig. 123.* The Transversus perinei arises from the ramus of the ischium at each side, and is . inserted into the central tendinous point of the * Muscles of the perineum. 1. Acceleratores urinae; the figure rests on the corpus spongiosum penis. 2. Corpus cavernosum of one side. 3. Erector penis of one side. 4. Transversus perinei of one side. 5. Triangular space, through which the triangular ligament is seen. 6. Sphincter ani; its ante- rior extremity cut off. 7. Levator ani of the left side; the deep space between the tuberosity of the ischium (8) and the anus, is the ischio-rectaL fossa; the same fossa is seen on the opposite side. 9. Spine of the ischium. 10. Left coccygeus muscle. The boundaries of the perineum are well exhibited in this engraving.

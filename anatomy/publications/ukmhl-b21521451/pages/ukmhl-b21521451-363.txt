353 RADIAL ARTERY. the pronator quadratus, and forms an arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal brairch of the ulnar artery. From this arch twigs are given off to supply Fig. 155." the wrist-joint. TheCarpeaposteriorcross.es the carpus transversely, and inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Superiorly it inoscu- lates with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery ; inferiorly it gives off dorsal interosseous branches, which anastomose with the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, and run forward upon the dorsal in- terossei muscles of the third and fourth metacarpal spaces. The Metacarpea or first dorsal interosseous branch runs forward to the metacar- pal space between the index and middle finger. At the cleft of the fingers it inoscu- lates with the palmar digital artery, and gives off dorsal collateral branches. It is joined opposite the heads of * Arteries of the forearm. 1.

ANCONEUS. EXTENSOR OSSIS METACARPI POLLIC1S. 259 Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor secundi internodii, extensor indicis, ulna, and wrist-joint. By its radial border it is in relation with the extensor communis digi- torum and extensor minimi digiti, and by the ulnar border with the anconeus. The Anconeus (anconeus parvus, vel quartus) is a small trian- gular muscle, having the appearance of being a continuation of the triceps ; it arises from the outer condyle, and is inserted into the olecranon and triangular surface of the upper extremity of the ulna. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a strong tendinous aponeurosis derived from the triceps. By its deep surface with the elbow-joint, orbicular ligament, and slightly with the supinator brevis. Deep layer.—Supinator brevis, Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, Extensor primi internodii pollicis, Extensor secundi internodii pollicis, Extensor indicis. Dissection.—The muscles of the superficial layer should be re- moved in order to bring the deep group completely into view. The Supinator brevis cannot be seen in its entire extent, until the l-adial extensors of the carpus are divided from their origin. It arises from the external condyle, from the external lateral and orbicular ligament, and from the ulna, and winds around the upper part of the radius, to be inserted into the upper third of its oblique line. The posterior interosseous artery and nerve perforate the lower border of this muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pronator radii teres, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, radial artery and veins, musculo-spiral nerve, radial and posterior intei-osseous nerve. By its deep surface with the elbow-joint and ligaments, interosseous membrane, and radius. The Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (abductor pollicis longus) is placed immediately below the supinator brevis. It arises from the ulna, interosseous membrane, and radius, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its tendon passes through the groove immediately in front of the styloid pro- cess of the radius. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor minimi digiti, extensor communis digitorum, fascia of the forearm and annular ligament. By its deep surface with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and supinator longus, and at the wrist with the radial artery. By its upper border with the edge of the s 2

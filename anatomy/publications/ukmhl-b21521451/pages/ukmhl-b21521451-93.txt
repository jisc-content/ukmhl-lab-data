77 STERNUM. between twenty-five and thirty. The ensiform appendix becomes joined to the body of the sternum at forty or fifty years ; and the manubrium to the body only in very old age. Two small pisiform pieces have been described by Beclard and Breschet, as being situated upon and somewhat behind each extremity of the incisura semilunaris of the upper border of the manubrium.

Beclard considers them as the analogue of the fourchette of birds, and Breschet as the sternal ends of a pair of cervical ribs.

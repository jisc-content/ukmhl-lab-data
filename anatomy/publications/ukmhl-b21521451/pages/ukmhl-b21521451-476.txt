MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 468 immediately external to the corpus pyramidale, from which, and from the corpus restiforme, it is separated by a groove. In this Fig. 188.* groove some longitudinal fibres are seen which enclose the base of the corpus olivare, and have been named funiculi siliquce, those which lie to its inner side being the funiculus internus, and those to its outer side the funiculus externus. Besides these there are Â« * Base of the brain upon which several sections have been made, showing the distribution of the longitudinal or diverging fibres. 1. Medulla oblongata. 2. One half of the pons Varolii. 3. Crus cerebri crossed by the optic nerve (4), and spreading out into the thalamus opticus and corpus striatum to form the corona radiata. 5. Optic nerve near its origin: the nerves about the crus cerebri and cerebelli are the same as in figure 186. 6. Olfactory nerve. 7. Cor- pora albicantia. On the left side of the figure a portion of the brain has been removed to show the distribution of the diverging fibres. 8. Fibres of the corpus pyramidale passing through the pons Varolii. 9. Fibres passing through the thalamus opticus. 10. Fibres passing into the corpus striatum. 11. Fibres of the hemisphere. 12. The fifth nerve: its two roots. 13. Fibres of the corpus pyramidale passing outwards with the corpus restiforme into the substance of the cerebellum ; arciform fibres of Solly. The fibres referred to are those below the figure, the figure itself rests on the corpus olivare. 14. Section through one hemisphere of the cerebellum, showing the corpus rhomboideum in the centre of its white substance; the arbor vitae is also seen. 15. Opposite hemisphere of the cerebellum.

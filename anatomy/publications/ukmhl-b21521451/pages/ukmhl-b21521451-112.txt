96 ILIUM. The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, below by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by the anterior and posterior border ; it is concave and smooth for the anterior two-thirds of its extent, and lodges the iliacus muscle. The posterior third is rough, for articulation with the sacrum, and divided by a deep groove into two parts ; an anterior or auricular portion, shaped like the pinna, and coated by cartilage in the fresh bone ; and a posterior portion, very rough and uneven, for the at- tachment of interosseous ligaments. .The external surface is uneven, partly convex, and partly con- cave : it is bounded above by the crest; below by a prominent arch, which forms the upper segment of the acetabulum ; and, be- fore and behind, by the anterior and posterior border.

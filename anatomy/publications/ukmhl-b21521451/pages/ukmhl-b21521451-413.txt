405 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. extends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta to the right side of the mediastinum, where it unites with the right vena innominata, to constitute the superior vena cava. It is in relation in front with the left sterno-clavicular articulation and first piece of the sternum. At its com- mencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left inferior thyroid, left mam- mary, and left superior in- tercostal vein. It also re- ceives some small veins from the mediastinum and thymus gland. There are no valves in the vena? innominate. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The superior cava (descen- dens) is a short trunk about three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two vense innominatse. It descends perpendicularly on the right side of the arch of the aorta * Veins of the trunk and neck. 1. Superior vena cava. 2. Left vena innominata. 3. Right vena innominata. 4.

The External carotid artery (carotis externa) ascends nearly perpendicularly from opposite the upper border of the thyroid car- tilage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and meatus auditorius, where it divides into two terminal branches, temporal and internal maxillary. Relations.â€”In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides ; by the hypo- glossal nerve near its origin; higher up it is situated in the sub- stance of the parotid gland, and has in front the facial nerve and temporo-maxillary vein. Behind, it is separated from the internal carotid by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscle, glosso- pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

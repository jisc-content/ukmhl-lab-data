377 FEMORAL ARTERY. magnus, to the side of the vastus interims. To its inner side it is in relation at its upper part with the femoral vein, and lower down • with the pectineus, adductor longus, and sartorius. The (. immediate relations of the artery are, the femoral vein, long saphenous nerve, and muscular nerve to the vastus internus. The vein at Poupart's ligament lies to the inner side of the artery ; but lower down gets behind it, and inclines to its outer side. The muscular nerve lies to the outer side, and somewhat upon the sheath for the lower two-thirds of its extent; and the long saphenous nerve is situated within the sheath, and in front of the artery for the same extent. Plan of the Relations of the Femoral Artery. Inner Side. Femoral vein, Pectineus, Adductor longus, Sartorius. Front. Fascia lata, Long saphenous nerve, Sartorius, Aponeurotic canal. Outer Side. Psoas, Vastus internus. Behind. Psoas muscle, Femoral vein, Adductor longus. . Branches.—The branches of Superficial circumflexa ilii, t r Superficial epigastric, Superior external pudic, Inferior external pudic, the Femoral Artery are, the ( External circumflex, Profunda, < Internal circumflex, ( Three perforating. Muscular, Anastomotica magna. The Superficial circumflexa ilii artery (circumflexa ilii.externa) arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, and passes obliquely outwards towards the crest of the ilium, where it pierces the fascia lata. It supplies the integument of the groin, superficial fascia, and inguinal glands. The Superficial epigastric (epigastrica superficial is) arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, pierces the fascia lata, and ascends obliquely towards the umbilicus between the two layers of the superficial fascia. It distributes branches to the inguinal glands and integument, and inosculates with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary artery. The Superior external pudic (pudenda externa, superior) arises

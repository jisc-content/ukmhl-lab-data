382 ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. Relations.—In its course it rests on the interosseous membrane (to which it is connected by a little tendinous arch which is thrown across it), the lower part of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the joint. In its upper third ft is situated between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digftorum, lower down between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis ; and just before it reaches the ankle it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and becomes placed between that tendon and the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. Its immediate relations are the venae comites and anterior tibial nerve ; the latter lies at first to its outer side, at about the middle of the leg it is placed superficially to the artery, and at the ankle is again at its outer side. Plan of the Relations of the Anterior Tibial Artery. Front. Deep fascia, Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor proprius pollicis, Anterior tibial nerve. Outer Side. Anterior tibial nerve, Anterior Tibial Extensor longus digitorum, Artery. | Extensor proprius pollicis, I Tendons of extensor longus digitorum. Behind. Interosseous membrane, Tibia (lower fourth), Ankle-joint. Branches.—The branches of the Anterior Tibial Artery are, the Recurrent, External malleolar, Muscular, Internal malleolar. The Recurrent branch (tibialis recurrens) passes upwards beneath the origin of the tibialis anticus muscle to the front of the knee- joint, upon which it is distributed, anastomosing with the articular arteries. The Muscular branches are numerous, they supply the muscles of the anterior tibial region. The Malleolar arteries (malleolares anteriores) are distributed to the ankle-joint; the external, passing beneath the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, inosculates with the anterior peroneal artery and dorsalis pedis; the internal, Inner Side. Tibialis anticus, Tendon of extensor proprius pollicis.

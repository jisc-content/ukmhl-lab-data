The coronary arteries (cardiacse) arise from the aortic sinuses at the commencement of the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately above the free margin of the semilunar valves. The left coronary (coronaria cordis sinistra) passes forwards, between the pulmonary artery and left appendix auriculae, and divides into two branches ; one of which (posterior) winds around the base of the left ventricle in the auriculo-ventricular groove, and

231 DIAPHRAGM A. of the muscle at each side, closed by a few irregular muscular fibres and by the serous membranes of the cavity of the chest and abdomen. A protrusion of any portion of the contents of the abdomen through this opening constitutes phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia. The lumbar portion consists of a right and left lateral half {'pil- lars, crura); each of which is composed of three smaller pillars or crura, internal, middle, and external. Fig. 122* * Under or abdominal side of the diaphragm. 1, 2, 3. The thoracic portion; figure 1 rests on the central leaflet of the tendinous centre; figure 2 on the left or smallest leaflet; figure 3 on the right leaflet. 4. Fasciculus from the ensiform cartilage; a small triangular space, closed only by the serous mem- branes of the abdomen and chest, is left on either side of this fasciculus. 5. Ligamentum arcuatum externum of the left side. 6. Ligamentum arcu- atum internum. 7. A small arched opening occasionally found, through which the lesser splanchnic nerve passes. 8. Tendon of the right or larger crus; a muscular fasciculus from this tendon curves to the left side of the greater muscle between the oesophageal and aortic opening. 9. Fourth lumbar ver- tebra. 10. Tendon of the left or shorter crus. 11. Aortic opening occupied by the cylinder of the aorta. 12. Portion of the oesophagus issuing through the oesophageal opening; in this figure the oesophageal opening is tendinous at its anterior part, a state that is not uncommon. 13. Opening for the infe- rior vena cava, in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm. 14. Psoas magnus passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum; it has been removed on the opposite side to show the arch more distinctly. 15. Quadratus lumborum passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum externum; this muscle has also been removed on the left side.

OPHTHALMIC GANGLION. 527 proceeds from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and joins its superior angle; a short and thick branch, the short root, from the inferior division of the third nerve to its inferior angle; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, from the carotid plexus. Occasionally the ophthalmic ganglion receives also a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and sometimes from the abducens nerve. Fig. 201.* * Cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerve. 1. Ganglion of Ribes. 2. Fila- ment by which it communicates with the carotid plexus (3). 4. Ophthalmic or lenticular ganglion, giving off ciliary branches. 5. Part of the inferior division of the third nerve communicating with the ganglion by means of a short thick branch (short root). 6. Part of the nasal nerve, connected with the ganglion by means of a longer branch (long root). 7. A slender filament (the sympathetic root) sent directly backwards from the ganglion to the ca- rotid plexus. 8. Part of the sixth nerve in the cavernous sinus, receiving two branches from the carotid plexus. 9. Meckel's ganglion (spheno-palatine). 10. Spheno-palatine nerves. 11. Descending or palatine branches. 12. Its internal or nasal branches. 13. Naso-palatine branch, one of the nasal branches. 14. Posterior branch of the ganglion, the Vidian nerve. 15. Its carotid branch (n. petrosus profundus), communicating with the carotid plexus. 16. Its petrosal branch (n. petrosus superficialis major), joining the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. 17. Facial nerve. 18. Chorda tympani nerve, descending to join the gustatory nerve. 19. Gustatory nerve. 20. Submaxillary ganglion, receiving the chorda tympani, and other filaments from the gustatory. 21. Superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic.

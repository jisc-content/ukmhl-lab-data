DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. 383 beneath the tendons of the extensor proprius pollicis and tibialis anticus, inosculates with branches of the posterior tibial and inter- nal plantar artery. They supply branches to the ankle-joint. Fig. 163. The Dorsalis pedis artery is continued forward along the tibial side of the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe, where it gives off a branch, dorsalis hal- lucis ; it then dips between the two heads of the first dorsal interos- seous muscle into the sole of the foot and becomes continuous with the deep plantar arch. Relations.â€”The dorsalis pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis ; at its fibular side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near its ter- mination it is crossed by the inner tendon-of the extensor brevis digi- torum. It is accompanied by vense comites, and has the continuation of the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. * Anterior aspect of the leg and foot, showing the anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery; the tibialis anticus has been removed. 1. Tendon of insertion of the quadriceps extensor muscle. 2. Insertion of the ligamentum patellae into the lower border of the patella. 3. Tibia. 4. Extensor proprius pollicis muscle. 5. Extensor longus digitorum. 6. The peronei. 7. Inner belly of the gastrocnemius and soleus. 8. Annular ligament. 9. Anterior tibial artery. 10. Its recurrent branch inosculating with (2) inferior articular, and (1) supe- rior articular arteries, branches of the popliteal. 11. Internal malleolar artery. 17. External malleolar inoscu- lating with the anterior peroneal artery 12. 13. Dorsalis pedis artery. 14. Tarsea and metatarsea; the tarsea is nearest the ankle, the meta- tarsea is seen giving off the interossese. 15. Dorsalis hallucis artery. 16.

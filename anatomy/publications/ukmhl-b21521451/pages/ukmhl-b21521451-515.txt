MEDIAN NERVE. °d 50? and fbi'earm, arises by two heads which proceed from the outer and inner cord of the plexus and embrace the axillary artery. The nerve lies at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, but crosses it in the middle, some- times in front and sometimes be- hind, and getting to its inner side descends to the bend of the elbow. It next passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres and beneath the flexor sublimis digitorum, and runs down the middle of the forearm, lying between the latter muscle and the flexor profundus to the wrist. It then dips beneath the annular ligament and enters the palm of the hand. Just above the wrist it is superficial, lying by the outer border of the ten- dons of ^he flexor sublimis digi- torum. The Branches of the median nerve are— Muscular, Anterior interosseous, Superficial palmar, Digital. The Muscular brandies are given off by the nerves at the bend of the elbow ; they ai-e distri- buted to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar half of the flexor profundus. The branch to_ the pronator radii teres sends off reflected filaments to the elbow-joint. Fig. 199.* * Brachial plexus of nerves with its branches and their distribution. 1. Bra- chial plexus. 2.

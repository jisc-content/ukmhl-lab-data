251 POSTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. Fig. 126. 'Posterior Humeral Region. Triceps brachii. Dissection. â€”Remove the integument and fascia from the rior aspect of the upper arm. The Triceps brachii (rpeis Ke<pa\al, three heads ; triceps ex- tensor cubiti) arises by three heads ; external, middle, and internal. The external head (anconeus externus) proceeds from the whole length of the external and posterior aspect of the humerus, from the insertion of the teres minor at the greater tuberosity to the external condyle, and also from the external intermuscular septum. The in- . ternal head (anconseus internus) arises from the inner and posterior aspect of the humerus, from the insertion of the teres major to the internal condyle, and from the in- ternal intermuscular septum. The middle or long head (anconeus longus) arises from the lower part of the h;ead and adjoining part of the border of the scapula, to the extent of about an inch. The three heads, passing downwards in dif- ferent directions, unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted into the olecranon process of the ulna, and sends an expansion to the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa is situated between the tendon of the muscle and the upper part of the olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and major, and divides the tri- angular interspace of those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The trian- gular space is bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps ; it gives passage to the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins. The quad- rangular space is bounded on three sides by the three preceding * Posterior view of the upper arm, and triceps muscle. 1. External head. 2. Long or scapular head. 3.

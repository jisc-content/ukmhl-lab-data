GENERAL ANATOMY OF ARTERIES. 316 The middle or contractile coat is thick and laminated, and com- posed of structures which take a transverse or circular direction ; hence it is brittle and easily cut through when a ligature is applied. In the small arteries it is wholly composed of smooth muscular fibres ; in arteries of medium size, as the external and internal carotid, brachial, crural, and popliteal, of a mixture of smooth muscular and elastic tissue ; and in the large arteries, as the aorta, common carotids and iliacs, chiefly of elastic tissue. The smooth muscular tissue is the only component structure of the middle coat of small arteries ; in which there are two or three laminae, the fibres about -g-tnnr Â°fan incn m diameter being arranged in rings ; in smaller arteries there is but one muscular lamina, the elements of the fibres being shorter and in proportion as the arteries are more and more minute, becoming reduced to the earliest developmental form, namely, short elliptic cells with oblong nuclei ; ultimately they are completely lost. In arteries of medium size, elastic fibres are super- added to the muscular fibres, the latter predominating for awhile, and in the large arteries the smooth muscular fibres are reduced to their cellular form and gradually diminished in number and im- portance, until they exist as mere rudimentary elements scattered among the layers of elastic tissue, of which the middle coat of large arteries is principally composed. The elastic tissue is absent altogether in the middle coat of small arteries, but makes its appearance in arteries of medium size as fine fibres disposed in a network of wide meshes. In the larger kind of medium-sized arteries, the elastic net- work is mingled with areolar tissue, and a tendency to the alternation of these tissues begins to be apparent; further- more, in some of the largest of the medium arteries the elastic tissue is found, in parts of the vessel, to occupy the whole thickness of the middle coat, thus leading upwards to the large ves- sels in which the elastic tissue is the chief constituent. While thus encroaching as it were on the structure of the middle coat of arteries, the elastic tissue presents a corresponding series of transitional forms; at first it exists as fine fibres disposed singly or in a fine net- work with open meshes ; then the fibres become larger and the meshes closer; and interlaced so as to form a fibrous mem- brane with narrow meshes; next by the increase of breadth * Network of coarse elastic tissue from the middle coat of the pulmonary artery of the horse; the fibres are pierced with circular openings.

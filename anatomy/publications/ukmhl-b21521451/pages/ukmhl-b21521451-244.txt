230 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The Psoas parvus is a small and infrequent muscle which arises from the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra and from the inter- vertebral substance between them, and terminates in a long slender tendon which expands inferiorly and is inserted into the iiio-pecti- neal line and eminence. The tendon is continuous by its outer border with the iliac fascia. Relations.—It rests on the psoas magnus, and is covered in by the peritoneum ; superiorly it passes beneath the ligamentum arcua- tum internum of the diaphragm. Diaphragm a.—To obtain a good view of this important inspi- ratory muscle, the peritoneum should be dissected from its under surface. It is a transverse muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, and is composed of two portions, thoracic and lumbar, the former being named the greater, the latter the lesser muscle. The thoracic portion arises from the ensiform cartilage by a dis- tinct slip and from the internal surface of the six inferior ribs indi- gitating with the transversalis. The fibres converge to be inserted into the central tendon. A triangular interval exists between the sternal and costal portion * The diaphragm viewed from the front, showing its upper or thoracic surface. 1,1.

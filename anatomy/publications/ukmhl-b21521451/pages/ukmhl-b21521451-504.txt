496 SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. Its Branches of distribution are muscular branches to the sterno- mastoid and trapezius. In the substance of the sterno-mastoid it communicates with branches of the cervical plexus, and in the pos- terior triangular space with the third and fourth cervical nerve. * Anatomy of the side of the neck, showing- the nerves of the tongue. 1. Fragment of the temporal bone containing the meatus auditorius externus, mastoid, and styloid process. 2. Stylo-hyoid muscle. 3. Stylo-glossus. 4. Stylo-pharyngeus. 5. Tongue. 6,18. Hyo-glossus muscle: its two por- tions. 7. Genio-hyo-glossus. 8. Genio-hyoideus; both arise from the inner surface of the symphysis of the lower jaw. 9. Sterno-hyoid muscle. 10. Sterno- thyroid. 11. Thyro-hyoid, upon which the thyro-hyoidean branch of the hypoglossal nerve is seen ramifying. 12. Omo-hyoid crossing the common carotid artery (13), and internal jugular vein (14). 15. External carotid giving off its branches. 16. Internal carotid. 17. Gustatory nerve giving a branch to the submaxillary ganglion (18), and communicating a little farther on with the hypoglossal nerve. 19. Submaxillary, or Wharton's duct, passing forwards to the sublingual gland. The submaxillary ganglion is the small round body between figures 18 and 19. 20. Glossopharyngeal nerve, passing in behind the hyo-glossus muscle. 21. Hypoglossal nerve curving around the occipital artery. 22. Descendens noni nerve, forming a loop with (23) the eommunicans noni, which is seen arising by filaments from the upper cer- vical nerves. 24. Pneumogastric nerve, emerging from between the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery, and entering the chest. 25. Facial nerve, emerging from the stylo-mastoi'd foramen and crossing the external carotid artery.

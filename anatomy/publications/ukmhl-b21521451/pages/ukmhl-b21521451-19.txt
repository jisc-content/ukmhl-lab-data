3 STRUCTURE OF BONE. diameter of -^^y of an inch, and, besides constituting the general structure of the basis substance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about Fig.I* â– sis of an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameter of the canals has a medium average of -g^-jr of an inch. The cancelli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are composed of lamellae : and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be compared to an Haversian canal of which the medullary cavity is the magnified channel : and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the surface of a bone, and largest near its centre, where they gradually merge into cancelli; by the frequent communications of their branches they form a coarse network in the basis substance. The corpuscles of Purhinje, are thickly disseminated through the basis substance ; they are irregular in size and form, give off numerous minute branching tubuli, which radiate from all parts of * Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg. Magnified 300 diameters. 1. One of the Haversian canals surrounded by its concentric lamellae. The corpuscles are seen between the lamellae; but the calcigerous tubuli are omitted. 2. An Haversian canal with its con- centric lamellae, Purkinjean corpuscles, and tubuli. 3. The area of one of the canals. 4, 4. Direction of the lamellae of the great medullary canal. Between the lamellae at the upper part of the figure, several very long corpuscles with their tubuli are seen. In the lower part of the figure, the outlines of two other canals are given, to show their form and mode of arrangement in the entire bone. b2

688 STRUCTURE OF THE UTERUS. it is distinguished from the body by a well-marked constriction ; around its circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, and at its extremity is an opening which is nearly round in the virgin-, and transverse after parturition, the os uteri (os tincse), bounded before and behind by two labia ; the posterior labium being some- what longer than the anterior, and somewhat less thick. The open- ing of the os uteri is of considerable size, and is named the orijjicium uteri externum; the canal then becomes narrowed, and at the upper end of the cervix is constricted into a smaller opening, the orificium internnm* Beyond this point the canal of the cervix expands into the shallow triangular cavity of the uterus, the inferior angle cor- responding with the orificium internum, and the two superior angles, which are funnel-shaped and represent the original bicornute con- dition of the organ, with the commencement of the Fallopian tubes. The uterus is composed of three tunics : of an external or serous coat, derived from the peritoneum, which constitutes the duplica- tures at each side of the organ called the broad ligaments ; of a middle or muscular coat, which gives thickness and bulk to the uterus; and of an internal or mucous membrane, which lines its interior, and is continuous on the one hand with the mucous lining of the Fallopian tubes, and on the other with that of the vagina. In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly dense in texture, offers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish, fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uterus the fibres are of large size, distinct, and separable into three layers : external, which are longitudinal and transverse, the former constituting a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surface and fundus of the organ, the latter being prolonged outwards on the Fallopian tubes, and into the round and ovarian ligaments; middle, a thick layer consisting of flat bundles of transverse, longitudinal, and oblique fibres, com- plexly interlaced, and traversed by a plexus of large veins, which give this portion of the substance of the uterus a spongy appearance ; and an internal layer of longitudinal, transverse, and oblique fibres. The longitudinal fibres of the internal or deep layer are thin and slender, the transverse stronger and continued as an annular stratum upon the Fallopian tubes, while around the os uteri they form a circular ring, the sphincter uteri. The formative elements of the muscular coat are short, fusiform fibre cells, about of an inch long, with long oval nuclei, intermingled with a considerable quantity of immature nucleated areolar tissue. The mucous membrane, of a whitish or pale red colour, is closely connected, or more correctly, is blended with the muscular coat; it is composed of immature nucleated areolar tissue without elastic fibres, is smooth on the surface, and coated by a ciliated epithelium, * The orificium internum is not unfrequently obliterated in old persons. Indeed, this obliteration is so common, as to have induced M ayer to regard it as normal.

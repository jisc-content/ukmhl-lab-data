Rectus anticus minor, Rectus anticus major, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and, the javj being fixed by the masseteres, temporales and pterygoidei, Platysma myoides, Genio-hyoideus, Digastricus, Genio-hyo-glossus. Mylo-hyoideus, Extensors. Trapezius, Rectus posticus major, Splenius capitis, Rectus posticus minor, Complexus, Obliquus superior. Trachelo - mastoideus, Abductors* Platysma myoides, Trachelo-mastoideus, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus, Complexus, Trapezius, Rectus posticus major, Splenius capitis, Rectus lateralis. Neck. Flexors. Platysma myoides, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus, Digastricus, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus, Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Omo-hyoideus, Rectus anticus major, Longus colli, Scalenus anticus, Scalenus medius. * Muscles having broad and numerous attachments or an oblique position must necessarily act in several directions, and consequently occupy a place in different groups of this table.

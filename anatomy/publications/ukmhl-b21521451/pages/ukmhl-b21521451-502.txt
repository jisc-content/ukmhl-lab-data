INFERIOR LARYNGEAL NERVE. 494 side of the arteria innominata to tl left it passes in front of the arch e deep cardiac plexus; on the of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. One or two cardiac branches also proceed from the thoracic portion of the right pneumogastric nerve. The Inferior laryngeal, or recurrent laryngeal nerve, curves around the subclavian artery on the right, and the arch of the aorta on the left side. It ascends in the groove between the trachea and oeso- phagus, and piercing the lower fibres of the inferior constrictor muscle enters the larynx close to the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid carti- lage. It is distributed to all the muscles of the larynx, with the exception of the crico- thyroid, and communicates on the arytenoideus muscle with the superior laryngeal * * Origin and distribution of the glosso - pharyngeal, pneumogas- tric, and spinal accessory nerve. 1, 3, 4.

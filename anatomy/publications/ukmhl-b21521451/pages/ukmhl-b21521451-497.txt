FACIAL NERVE. 489 and communicate with the supra-orbital nerve and temporal branch of the superior maxillary. The Malar branches cross the malar bone to the outer angle of the eye, and supply the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, and eyelids. They communicate with the subcutaneus malse branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and with branches of the ophthalmic nerve in the eyelids. * Distribution of the facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus. 1. Facial nerve, escaping from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and crossing the ramus of the lower jaw; the parotid gland has been removed in order to see the nerve distinctly. 2. Posterior auricular branch; the digastric and stylo- hyoid twigs are seen near the origin of this branch. 3. Temporal branches, communicating with (4) branches of the supra-orbital nerve. 5. Infra-orbital branches, communicating with (6) the infra-orbital nerve. 7. Supra-maxil- lary branches, communicating with (8) the mental nerve. 9. Infra-maxillary branches communicating with (10) the superficialis colli nerve, and forming a plexus (11) over the submaxillary gland. The distribution of the branches of the facial in a radiated direction over the side of the face and their looped communications constitute the pes anserinus. 12. Auricularis magnus nerve, one of the ascending branches of the cervical plexus. 13. Occipitalis minor ascending along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. 14. Superficial and deep descending branches of the cervical plexus. 15. Spinal accessory nerve, giving off a branch to the external surface of the trapezius muscle. 16. Occipitalis major nerve, the posterior branch of the second cervical.

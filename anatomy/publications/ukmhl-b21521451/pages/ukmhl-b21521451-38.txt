22 OCCIPITAL BONE. OP THE SKULL. The skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column^ is divisible into two parts, the cranium and the face ; the former being adapted, by its form, structure, and strength, to contain and protect the brain; the latter, the chief organs of sense. The Cranium is composed of eight separate bones; viz., the Occipital, Two temporal, Two parietal, Sphenoid, Frontal, Ethmoid. Occipital Bone.—This bone is situated at the posterior part and Fig.13.* base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisible into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. External Surface.—Crossing the middle of the bone transversely, from one lateral angle to the other, is a prominent ridge, the superior * External surface of the occipital bone. 1. Superior curved line. 2. Exter- nal occipital protuberance. 3. Spine. 4. Inferior curved line. The convexity of the bone in this situation, on either side of the spine, is the receptaculum cerebelU. 5. Foramen magnum. 6. Condyle of the right side. 7. Posterior condyloid fossa, in which the posterior condyloid foramen is found. 8. An- terior condyloid foramen, concealed by the margin of the condyle. 9. Trans- verse process; this process on the internal surface of the bone forms the jugular eminence. 10. The notch in front of the jugular eminence, forming part of the jugular foramen. 11. Basilar process. 12. Rough projections into which the odontoid ligaments are inserted.

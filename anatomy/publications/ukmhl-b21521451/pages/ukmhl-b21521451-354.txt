This artery gives off a small branch, auditiva interna, which accompanies the facial and auditory nerves into the meatus auditorius internus; the auditory branch may be derived directly from the basilar. The Superior cerebellar arteries (cerebelli superior), two of the terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are dis- Fig. 152 * * Circle of Willis.

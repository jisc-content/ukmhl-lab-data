7 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. clusters lie in immediate relation with the punctum ossificationis ; they are oval in figure (about of an inch in length by -^-^ in breadth), and elongated in the direction of the long axis of the bone. The cells composing the cluster lie transversely with regard to its axis. In the first instance they are closely compressed, but by degrees are parted by a thin layer of intercellular substance, and each cluster is separated from neighbouring clusters by a broader Fig. 4.* layer (3 2*5 6 of an inch) of intercellular substance. Such are the changes which occur in cartilage preparatory to the formation of bone. Ossification is accomplished by the formation of very fine and de- licate fibres within the intercellular substance : this process com- mences at the punctum ossificationis, and extends from that point through every part of the bone, in a longitudinal direction in long, and in a radiated direction in flat bones. Starting from the punc- tum ossificationis, the fibres embrace each cluster of cells, and then send branches between the individual cells of each group. In this manner the network, characteristic of bone, is formed, while the cells by their conjunction constitute the permanent areolae and Ha- versian canals. With a high magnifying power, the delicate ossific * The same cartilage at the seat of ossification; the clusters of cells are arranged in columns; the intercellular spaces, between the columns, being â€¢32V0 of an inch in breadth. To the right of the figure osseous fibres are seen occupying the intercellular spaces, at first bounding the clusters laterally, then splitting them longitudinally, and encircling each separate cell. The greater opacity of the right-hand border is due to a threefold cause, namely, increase of osseous fibres, opacity of the contents of the cells, and multiplication of oil globules. In the lower part of the figure some attempt has been made to show the texture of the cells.

POPLITEAL ARTEEY. 380 divides into branches, which are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thigh. This may be named the superior muscular artery. The Anastomotic^ magna (articularis genu superficialis) arises from the femoral near its termination at the opening in the adductor magnus, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch accompanies the internal saphenous nerve to the knee, and piercing the fascia lata is distributed to the integument. The deep branch passes onwards through the substance of the vastus internus muscle, resting on the tendon of the adductor magnus, to the knee ; where it inosculates with the internal arti- cular branches of the popliteal, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. It also sends a branch through the vastus internus, which supplies the synovial membrane of the joint, and inosculates with the superior external articular artery and external circumflex. The popliteal artery (poplitea. Fig. 164) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial artery. In structure the popliteal artery is remarkable for the thickness of its walls. POPLITEAL ARTERY. Plan of the Relations of the Popliteal Artery. Superficially.

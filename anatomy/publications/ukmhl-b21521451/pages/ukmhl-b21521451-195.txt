Both muscles acting together, draw the eyeball forward, and give the pupil that slight degree of eversion which enables it to admit the largest field of vision. 4. Nasal Group.— Pyramidalis nasi, naris, Dilatator naris, se nasi. The Pyramidalis nasi (procerus) is a small pyramidal slip of muscular fibres sent downwards on the bridge of the nose by the Fig. 109.: occipito-frontalis. It is serted into the tendinous expansion of the compressor naris. Relations.—By its upper surface with the integument; by its under surface with the periosteum of the frontal and nasal bone. Its outer border corresponds with the edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum ; its innir border with its fel- low, from which it is separated by a narrow cellular space. The Compressor naris (transversus nasi) is a thin and triangular muscle; it arises by its apex from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and spreads out upon the side of the nose into a thin tendinous expan- sion, which is continuous across the ridge with the muscle of the opposite side. It is connected at its origin with a muscular fasciculus which is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxil- * Muscles of the nose; after Arnold. 1. Pyramidalis nasi. 2.

FASCLZE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 312 the outer portion is attached to the os calcis and base of the meta- tarsal bone of the little toe, forming between these points a thick band, which gives origin to part of the abductor minimi digiti muscle. Besides constituting a strong layer of investment and defence to the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the dif- ferent muscles. A strong septum is given off from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fascia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groups, middle and two lateral; and transverse septa are stretched between these to sepa- rate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive part of their origin from the plantar fascia.

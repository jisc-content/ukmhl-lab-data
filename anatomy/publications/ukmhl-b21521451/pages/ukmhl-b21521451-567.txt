MEMBRANA TYMPANI. 559 by the mastoid cells ; and, throughout the rest of its circumference, by the thin osseous layer which connects the petrous with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. The Membrana tympani is a thin and semi-transparent mem- brane of an oval shape, its long diameter being vertical. It is in- serted into a groove situated around the circumference of the meatus, near its termination, and is placed obliquely across the area of that tube, the direction of the obliquity being downwards and inwards. It is concave towards the meatus, convex towards the tympanum, and composed of three layers, external, or epithelial; * Diagram of the ear. p. Pinna, t. Tympanum. I. Labyrinth. 1.

INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY. 371 The branches given off externally to the pelvis are, the Inferior hemorrhoidal, Arteria corporis hulbosi, Superficialis perinei, Arteria corporis cavernosi, Transversa perinei, Arteria dorsalis penis. The Inferior hcemorrhoidal arteries (externse) are three or four small branches, given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They cross the ischio-rectal fossa, and are distributed to the anus and to the muscles and integument of the anal region of the perineum. The Superficial perineal artery (perinea) is given off near the attachment of the crus penis ; it pierces the connecting layer of the perineal fascia and triangular ligament, and runs forward across Fig. 161 .* * Arteries of the perineum ; on the right side the superficial arteries are seen, on the left the deep. 1. The penis; the crus penis of the left side is cut through. 2. Acceleratores urinse muscles, enclosing the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum. 3. Erector penis, spread out upon the crus penis of the right side. 4. Anus, surrounded by the sphincter ani. 5. Ramus of ischium and pubes. 6. Tuberosity of ischium. 7. Lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, at- tached by its small extremity to the spine of the ischium. 8. Coccyx. 9. In- ternal pudic artery, crossing the spine of the ischium, and entering the peri- neum. 30. Inferior hemorrhoidal branches. 11. Superficialis perinei artery, giving off a small branch, transversa perinei, upon the transversus perinei muscle. 12. The same artery on the left side cut off. 13. Artery of the bulb. 14. The two terminal branches of the internal pudic artery; one is seen enter- ing the divided extremity of the crus penis, the artery of the corpus caverno- sum; the other, the dorsalis penis, ascends to the dorsum of the organ.

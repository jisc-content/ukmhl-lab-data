169 STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. Fig. 105.t According to my investigations,* the ultimate fibril of animal life is cylindrical when isolated, and probably polyhedral from pressure when forming part of an ultimate fibre or fasciculus. It measures in diameter 20q06 of an inch, and is composed of a succession of cells con- nected by their fiat surfaces. The cells are filled with a transparent substance, which may be termed myoline. The myoline differs in density in different cells, and from this circumstance be- stows a peculiarity of character on cer- tain of the cells. For example, when a fibril in its passive state is examined, there will be seen a series of dark ob- long bodies separated by light spaces of equal length; now, the dark bodies are each composed of a pair of cells containing the densest form of myoline, and are hence highly refractive, while the transparent spaces are constituted by a pair of cells containing a more fluid myoline. When the fibrils are collected together so as to form an ultimate fibre or fasciculus, the appearance of the cell is altered: those which look dark in the single fibril, that is, the most refractive, being ranged side by side, con- stitute the bright band ; while the transparent cells of the single fibril are the shaded strise of the fibre. When the ultimate fibril is very much stretched, the two highly refractive cells appear .each to be double; while the transparent space is evidently composed of four cells. The ultimate fibre of organic life, or smooth muscular fibre, is a simple homogeneous filament much smaller than the fibre of animal life, flat, smooth, and without transverse markings.

The pair of highly refractive cells; they form the dark parts of the single fibrils, but the bright parts of the fibre d. In the stretched fibril c, each cell has the appearance of being double. 2, 2. The pair of less re- fractive cells, light in the single fibrils, but forming the shaded stria in d. The transverse septum between these cells is very conspicuous; and in c two other septa are seen to exist, making the number of transparent cells four. In d, the tier of cells immediately above the dark tier is partially illumined from the obliquity of the light. By an error on the part of the engraver the boundary lines of the fibril are omitted in a b and c.

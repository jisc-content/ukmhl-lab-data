465 BASE OF THE BRAIN. mediately behind the optic commissure, and in front of the corpora albicantia. From its centre there projects a small conical body of grey substance, apparently a prolongation of the tuber cinereum, the * Under surface or base of the brain. 1. Anterior lobe of one hemisphere of the cerebrum. 2. Middle lobe. 3. Posterior lobe almost concealed by (4) the hemisphere of the cerebellum. 5. Pyramidal lobe of the inferior ver- miform process of the cerebellum. 6. Pneumogastric lobule. 7. Longitudinal fissure. 8. Olfactory nerves, with their bulbous expansion. 9. Substantia perforata at the inner termination of the fissure of Sylvius; the three roots of the olfactory nerve are seen on the substantia perforata. The commence- ment of the transverse fissure at each side is concealed by the inner border of the middle lobe. 10. Commissure of the optic nerves; the figure is placed between the optic nerves as tbey diverge from the commissure, and rests on the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum. 11. Tuber cinereum, from which the infundibulum is seen projecting. 12. Corpora albicantia. 13. Locus perforatus, bounded at each side by the crura cerebri, and third nerve. 14. Pons Varolii. 15. Crus cerebelli of one side. 16. Fifth nerve emerging from the side of the pons Varolii; the small nerve close to it is the fourth. 17. Sixth pair of nerves. 18. Facial and auditory nerve. 19. Corpora pyra- midalia of the medulla oblongata; the corpus olivare and part of the corpus restiforme are seen at each side. Just below the figure is the decussation of the fibres of the corpora pyramidalia. 20. Glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerve. 21. Hypoglossal nerve. 22. Anterior root of the first cervical spinal nerve. H H

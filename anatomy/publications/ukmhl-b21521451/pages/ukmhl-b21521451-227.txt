211 SACRO-LUMBALIS. sacroiliac ligament, articular and spinous tubercles of the sacrum, spinous processes of the lum- bar vertebrae, and, deeply, from the posterior transverse tubercles of the lumbar ver- tebrae ; the external portion being fleshy, the internal ten- dinous. The tendinous portion is broad and flat, and gives origin by its deep surface to a considerable part of the mus- cular fibres. In the lumbar region, the muscle proceeding from this extensive origin is a broad and thick musculo- tendinous mass, on the surface of which, opposite the last rib, a line of separation is appa- rent, the outer portion, about one-third, being the sacro- lumbalis, the inner two-thirds the longissimus dorsi. The sacro-lumbalis (ilio- costalis, Theile) ascends upon the chest internally to the angles of the ribs, and is inserted by separate slips, the four upper tendinous, the two lower fleshy, into the angles of the six lower ribs. If this muscle be turned a little outwards, a number of tendinous slips will be seen which take their origin from the upper border of the ribs near their angles, and termi- nate in muscular fasciculi, which prolong the sacro-lumba- lis to the upper part of the chest. This is the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem; it arises from the six lower ribs; and is * Fourth and fifth, and part of the sixth layer of the muscles of the back. 1.

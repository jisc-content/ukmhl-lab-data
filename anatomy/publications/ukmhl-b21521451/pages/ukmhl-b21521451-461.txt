LATERAL VENTRICLES. 453 ^ The Corpus fimbriatum is a narrow white band, situated imme- diately behind the choroid plexus, and extending with it into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thin edge of the fornix, and being attached to the hippocampus * Lateral ventricles of the cerebrum. 1,1. The two hemispheres cut down to a level with the corpus callosum so as to constitute the centrum ovale majus. The surface is seen to be studded with the small vascular points, puncta vas- culosa; and surrounded by a narrow margin which represents the grey sub- stance. 2. A small portion of the anterior extremity (genu) of the corpus callosum. 3. Its posterior boundary (splenium); the intermediate portion forming the roof of the lateral ventricles has been removed so as to expose completely those cavities. 4. Part of the septum lucidum, showing an inter- space between its layers, the fifth ventricle. 5. Anterior cornu of one side. 6. Commencement of the middle cornu. 7. Posterior cornu. 8. Corpus stria- tum of one ventricle. 9. Tenia semicircularis partly covered by the vena cor- poris striati. 10. A small part of the thalamus opticus. 11. The dark fringe- like body to the left of the cipher is the choroid plexus. This plexus commu- nicates with that of the opposite ventricle through the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius : a bristle is passed through this opening (under figure 4), and its extremities are seen resting on the corpus striatum at each side. The figure 11 rests on the edge of the fornix, on that part of it which is called, corpus fimbriatum. 12. Fornix. 13. Commencement of the hippo- campus major descending into the middle cornu. The rounded oblong body, directly behind figure 13, is the pes accessorius, and farther back, immediately under figure 7, the hippocampus minor.

Anterior layer of peritoneum, lining the under surface of the diaphragm. 2. Posterior layer. 3. Coronary ligament, formed by the passage of these two layers to the posterior border of the liver. 4. Lesser omentum; the two layers passing from the under surface of the liver to the lesser curve of the stomach. 5. The two layers meeting at the greater curve, then passing downwards and returning upon themselves, forming (6) the greater omentum. 7. Transverse meso-colon. 8. Posterior layer traced upwards in front of D, transverse duodenum, and P, pancreas, to become continuous with the posterior layer (2). 9. Foramen of Winslow: the dotted line bounding this foramen inferiorly marks the course of the hepatic artery forwards, to enter between the layers of the lesser omentum. 10.

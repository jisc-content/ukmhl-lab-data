OPHTHALMIC NERVE. 480 communicates with the facial nerve, and piercing the occipito-frontalis supplies the integument as far back as the occiput. The supra-trochlear branch passes inwards to the angle of the orbit, above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and is distri- buted, to the inner angle of the eye, root of the nose, and integument * Diagram showing the fifth pair of nerves with its branches. 1. Origin of the nerve by two roots. 2. The nerve escaping from the pons Varolii. 3. Casserian ganglion. 4. Ophthalmic nerve. 5. Frontal nerve giving off the supra-trochlear branch, and escaping on the forehead through the supra- orbital foramen. 6. Lachrymal nerve. 7. Nasal nerve, passing at 8 through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, and giving off the infra-trochlear branch. 9. Communication (superior root) of the nasal nerve with the ophthalmic ganglion. 10. A small portion of the third nerve with which the ganglion is seen communicating (inferior root); the ganglion gives off the ciliary nerves from its anterior aspect. 11. Superior maxillary nerve. 12. Orbital branch. 13. Spheno-palatine nerves communicating with Meckel's ganglion; the three branches from the lower part of the ganglion are the palatine nerves. 14, 14. Superior dental nerves, posterior, middle, and anterior, forming by their communications the superior maxillary plexus. 15. Infra-orbital branches distributed to the cheek. 16. Inferior maxillary nerve. 17. Its anterior or muscular trunk. 18. The posterior trunk; the two divisions are separated by an arrow. 19. Gustatory nerve. 20. Chorda tympani joining it at an acute angle. 21. Submaxillary ganglion. 22. Inferior dental nerve. 23. Mylo-hyoidean branch. 24. Auriculo-temporal nerve, dividing behind the articulation of the lower jaw, to reunite and form a single trunk. 25. Its branch of communication with the facial nerve. 26. Continuation of its trunk to the temple.

PARIETAL BONE. 25 called the posterior fontanelle. The inferior angle is the articular extremity of the basilar process. The lata yl angles, at each side, project into the interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.—By seven centres ; four for the four parts of the expanded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the ex- panded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae ; at birth the bone consists of four distinct pieces ; which are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs : to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis ; to the superior curved line, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid ; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis ; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the transverse process, the rectus lateralis ; and to the basilar process, the rectus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle con- strictor muscles. Parietal Bone.—The parietal bone is situated at the side and Fig. 15.* * External surface of the left parietal bone. 1. Superior or sagittal border. 2. Inferior or squamous border. 3.

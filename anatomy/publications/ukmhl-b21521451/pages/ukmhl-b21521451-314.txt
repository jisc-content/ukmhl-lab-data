302 OBTURATOR FASCIA. it is closely attached; and is reflected for a short distance upwards and downwards on those viscera. This layer is in contact, by its p Fig. 141.* external surface, with the levator ani muscle and coccygeus ; and is prolonged backwards over the sacral nerves to the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx, to which it is attached, meeting at the middle line the layer of the opposite side. The external layer is the obturator fascia, it covers in the ob- turator muscle, and is attached to the ramus of the pubes and ischium in front, and to the tuberosity of the ischium and falciform border of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament below. The levator ani arises from the line of division of the two layers of the pelvic fascia. The anterior border of the pelvic fascia is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a narrow interval, and the fascia passing from the side of the symphysis to the upper part of the prostate gland and front of the neck of the bladder, constitutes the anterior true ligament of the bladder (pubio-vesicale); a little * Transverse section of the pelvis, showing the distribution of the pelvic fascia. 1.

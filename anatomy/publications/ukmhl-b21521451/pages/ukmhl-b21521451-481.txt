Functionally or physiologically the cranial nerves admit of divi- sion into three groups, namely, nerves of special sense, nerves of motion, and compound nerves, that is, nerves which contain fibres both of sensation and motion. The nerves belonging to these groups are the following :—■ ( 1st. Olfactory. Special sense . . < 2nd. Optic. ( 7th. Auditory. 3rd. Motores oculorum. 4th. Pathetici. Motion . . . . -j 6th. Abducentes.

The fourth, facial, and three nerves of the eighth pair were con- sidered by Sir Charles Bell to form a system apart from the rest, and to be allied in the functions of expression and respiration. In consonance with this view he termed them respiratory nerves, and he gave to that part of the medulla oblongata from which they arise the name of respiratory tract. First pair. Olfactory.—The olfactory nerve arises by three roots; an inner or short root from the inner and posterior part of the anterior lobe close to the substantia perforata; a middle root from a papilla of grey matter (caruncula mamillaris), embedded in the anterior lobe, its white fibres being derived from the corpus striatum ; and an external or long root, which may be traced as a I

.MIST > VADEMECUM: fSTEM OF UMAN ANATOMY. BY EEASMUS WILSON, F.E.S. EIGHTS EDITION. LONDON: ;rchill, new burlington STRfeefc mdccclxi.LONDON: SAVILL AND EDWARDS, PRINTERS, CHANDOS STREET, COVENT GARDEN. M.NOTE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION. In presenting an Eighth Edition of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum to the members of the Medical Pro- fession—Students and Practitioners—the Author has not forgotten that we live in a competitive age; and that it becomes^is, not to be content with what we have already done, but to strive to attain, as nearly to perfection as the bonds of human fallibility permit. It has been, as it will always be, the earnest desire of the Author, that the Anatomist's Yade Mecum shall be esteemed worthy of being considered the ready remembrancer of the early studies of the Practitioner, and the patient and faithful guide of the Student. Some new Engravings have been added to this Edition; and the Author has to thank, as heretofore, several friends for their suggestions and contributions. 17, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, January, 1861.PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. In presenting for the Sixth time a new Edition of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum to my brethren of the pro- fession of medicine, it gives me great and heartfelt satisfaction to have the opportunity of announcing, that, in the preparation of the present Edition, I have received the valuable aid of a distinguished Professor of Medicine of Northern Europe, Andreas Retzius, M.D., F.R. Acad. S., Master of Surgery, Dean, and Professor of Anatomy in the Royal Caroline Institute of Stock- holm—a man justly renowned in the science of our art. The assistance of Professor Retzius is the more gra- tifying to me, as being the spontaneous offering of a great and distinguished man of science to a humble but zealous fellow-labourer; and his approbation has served as a stimulus to me to make the present Edition not unworthy of the praise which he has kindly be- stowed upon it. " I use your Anatomist's Vade Mecum," he observes, " for my students in the dissecting room. It has become my favourite manual for young students; for I find that, by it, they get a clearer and quicker insight into the study of Anatomy, than by any otherPREFACE. book. These are my reasons for interesting myself in its success, and for contributing my remarks for its emendation." In pursuance of these observations, Dr. Retzius had conveyed to me an interleaved copy of the work con- taining many notes for its improvement; and, further- more, took the trouble of sending to me, from across the seas, a preparation of the ligaments of the foot, showing the ligament to which he has given the name of ligamentum fundiforme (page 311). More deeply cherished is the promise conveyed in the following passage: " If the Almighty God will continue to bless me with health and life for some years longer, I will assist you in revising every new Edition, and intro- ducing all those new discoveries in anatomy which may be of use to the Student of Medicine." While thus acknowledging the assistance given to me by the great Scandinavian Professor, it may not be out of place to put on record an act of liberality, in connexion with this book, from another foreign source, namely, from the well known medical publishers of Philadelphia, Messrs. Blanchard and Lea. The fol- lowing extract from a letter addressed to me by them, and bearing date April 4, 1854, will explain the incident to which I refer. " You may perhaps be acquainted with the name of our house as having published in this country your works on Anatomy and Diseases of the Skin. When English works which we issue are successful, it always affords us pleasure to make the Author an acknow- ledgment more substantial, if not more gratifying, than the transatlantic reputation thus obtained; andPREFACE. vii we accordingly take pleasure in handing you the an- nexed draft, which we trust you will do us the favour to accept." With the above encouraging passages in the annals of the Anatomist's Vade Mecum, I now conclude, trust- ing that my reader, and those for whom the book was specially written, may find no reason to utter a judg- ment less favourable than the foreign reputation and wide circulation of the volume would seem to justify. 17, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, 1854. 4[CONTENTS.

The bones are the organs of support of the animal frame ; they give firmness and strength to the fabric, afford points of con- nexion to the numerous muscles, and bestow individual character on the body. In the limbs they are hollow cylinders, admirably calculated by their conformation and structure to resist violence and support weight. In the trunk and head, they are flattened and arched, to protect cavities and provide an extensive surface for attachment. In some situations they present projections of variable length, which serve as levers ; and in others are grooved into smooth surfaces, which act as pulleys for the passage of tendons. Moreover, besides supplying strength and solidity, they are equally adapted, by their numerous divisions and mutual apposition, to fulfil every movement which may tend to the preservation of the creature, or be conducive to his welfare. According to the latest analysis by Berzelius, bone is composed of about one-third of animal substance, which is almost completely reducible to gelatine by boiling, and two-thirds of earthy and alkaline salts. The special constituents of bone are present in the following proportions :— Cartilage 32"17 parts.— Blood-vessels . . . . 1'13 Phosphate of lime . . . . 51 "04 Carbonate of lime . . . . 11 "30 — Fluate of lime .... 2'00 — Phosphate of magnesia . . . 1*16 — Soda, chloride of sodium . . . 1*20 10G-00 B2 GENERAL ANATOMY OF BONES. Bones are divisible into three classes :—Long, flat, and irregular. The Long bones are found principally in the limbs, and consist of a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is cylindrical or prismoid in form, dense and hard in texture, and hollowed in the interior into a medullary canal. The extremities are broad and expanded, to articulate with adjoining bones ; and, in internal structure,' are cellular or cancellous. Upon the exterior of the bones are processes and rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and, foramina for the transmission of vessels and nerves. The character of long bones is, therefore, their general type of structure and their divisibility into a central portion and extremities, and not so much their length ; for there are certain long bones, as the second phalanges of the toes, which are less than a quarter of an inch in length, and which, in some instances, exceed in breadth their longitudinal axis. The long bones are, the clavicle, humerus, radius and ulna, femur, tibia and fibula, metacarpal bones, metatarsal, phalanges, and ribs. Flat bones are composed of two layers of dense bone with an inter- mediate cellular structure, and are divisible into, surfaces, borders, angles, and processes. They are adapted to inclose cavities : have processes upon their surface for the attachment of muscles ; and are perforated by foramina, for the passage of nutrient vessels to their cells, and for the transmission of vessels and nerves. They articulate with long bones by means of smooth surfaces plated with cartilage, and with each other, either by fibro-cartilaginous tissue, as at the symphysis pubis ; or by suture, as in the bones of the skull. The two condensed layers of the bones of the skull are named, tables ; and the intermediate cellular structure, diploe. The flat bones are, the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, sternum, scapulae, and ossa innominata. The Irregular bones include all that remain after the long and the flat bones have been selected. They are essentially irregular in their form, in some parts flat, in others short and thick ; and are constructed on the same general principle as other bones ; they have an exterior dense, and an interior more or less cellular. The bones of this class are, the temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxil- lary, inferior maxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, hyoid, vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, carpal, tarsal, and sesamoid bones, the latter in- cluding the patellae. Structure of Bone.—Bone is a dense, compact, and homogeneous substance (basis substance) filled with minute cells (corpuscles of Purkinje), which'are scattered numerously through its structure. The basis substance of bone is subfibrous and obscurely lamellated, the lanjellae being concentric in long and parallel in fiat bones ; it is traversbd in all directions, but especially in the longitudinal axis, by branching and inosculating canals (Haversian canals), which give passage to vessels and nerves, and in certain situations the lamellae separate from each- other, and leave between them areolar spaces (cancelli) of various magnitude. The lamellae have an average3 STRUCTURE OF BONE. diameter of -^^y of an inch, and, besides constituting the general structure of the basis substance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about Fig.I* ■sis of an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameter of the canals has a medium average of -g^-jr of an inch. The cancelli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are composed of lamellae : and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be compared to an Haversian canal of which the medullary cavity is the magnified channel : and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the surface of a bone, and largest near its centre, where they gradually merge into cancelli; by the frequent communications of their branches they form a coarse network in the basis substance. The corpuscles of Purhinje, are thickly disseminated through the basis substance ; they are irregular in size and form, give off numerous minute branching tubuli, which radiate from all parts of * Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg.

The form of the cells is oval or round, and more or less flattened ; their long diameter corresponds with the long axis of the bone, and their tubuli cross the direction of the lamellae, and constitute a delicate network in the basis substance by communicating with each other and with the tubuli of neighbouring cells. The tubuli of the cells nearest the Haversian canals terminate on the internal surface of those passages. The size of the cells varies in extreme measurement from ^ttutt *° •srnr °f an inca in l°ng diameter, an ordinary average being TCVo" ? the breadth of the oval cells is about one-half or one- third their length, and their thickness one-half their breadth. They are situated between the lamellse, to which circumstance they owe their compressed form. In the fresh state, bones are invested by a dense fibrous membrane, the periosteum, which covers every part of their surface with the exception of the articular extremities, the latter being coated by a thin layer of cartilage. The periosteum of the bones of the skull is termed pericranium ; and the analogous membrane of external cartilages, perichondrium. Lining the interior of the medullary canal of long bones, the Haversian canals, the cancelli, and the cancelli of the flat and irregular bones, is the medullai*y membrane, which acts as an internal periosteum. It is through the medium of the vessels ramifying in these membranes that the changes required by nutrition occur in bones, and the secretion of medulla into their interior is effected. The medullary canal, Haversian canals and cancelli of long bones, and the cancelli of other bones, are filled with a yellowish oily substance, the medulla, which is contained in a loose cellular tissue formed by the medullary membrane. Development of Bone.—To explain the development of bone it is necessary to inform the student that all organized bodies, whether belonging to the vegetable or animal kingdom, are developed pri- mordially from minute vesicles. These vesicles, or, as they are properly termed, cells, are composed of a thin membrane, containing a fluid or granular matter, and a small rounded mass, the nucleus, around which the cell was originally formed. Moreover, the nucleus generally contains one or more small round granules, the nucleolus, or nucleoli. From cells having this structure all the tissues of the body are elaborated ; the ovum itself originally presented this simple form, and the embryo at an early period is wholly composed of such nucleated cells. In their relation to each other, cells may be isolated and independent, as is exemplified in the corpuscles of the blood, * Miiller and Henle conceived that the bone cells and tubuli were the prin- cipal seat of the calcareous matter. Hence they were named calcigerous cells and tubuli.DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 5 chyle, and lymph ; secondly, they may cohere by their surfaces and borders, as in the epidermis and epithelium ; thirdly, they may be connected by an intermediate substance, which is then termed inter- cellular, as in cartilage and bone ; and, fourthly, they may unite with each other in rows, and upon the removal, by liquefaction, of their adherent surfaces, be converted into hollow tubuli. In the latter mode capillary vessels are formed, as also are the tubuli of nerves. One of the properties of cells may also be adverted to in this place ; it is that of reproducing similar cells in their interior. In this case, the nucleoli become the nuclei of the secondary cells, and as the latter increase in size, the membrane of the primary or parent cell is lost. Bone, in its earliest stage, is composed of an assemblage of these minute cells, which are soft and transparent, and are disposed within the embryo in the site of the future skeleton. From the resemblance which the soft bone-tissue bears to jelly, this has been termed the gelatinous stage of osteo-genesis. As development advances, the cells, heretofore loosely connected together, become separated by the interposition of a transparent intercellular substance, which, at first fluid, gradually becomes hard and condensed. The cartilaginous stage of osteo-genesis is now established, and cartilage is shown to consist of a transparent basis-substance, having minute cells dis- seminated through it at pretty equal distances. Coincident with the' formation of cartilage is the development of vascular canals in its substance, the canals being formed by the union of the cells in rows, and the subsequent liquefaction of their adhering surfaces. The change which next ensues is the concentration of the vascular canals towards some one point; for example, the centre of the shaft in a long, or the mid-point of a flat bone, and here the punctum ossificationis, or centre of ossification is established. What deter- mines the vascular concentration now alluded to, is a question not easily solved, but that it takes place is certain, and the vascular punctum is the most easily demonstrable of all the phenomena of ossification. During the formation of the punctum ossificationis, changes begin to be apparent in the cartilage cells. Originally they are simple nu- cleated cells (-grnnr to -ginnr °f an incn in diameter), having a rounded form. As growth proceeds, they become elongated, and it is then perceived that each cell contains two and often three nucleoli, around which smaller cells are in progress of formation. If we ex- amine them nearer the punctum ossificationis, we find that the young or secondary cells have each attained the size of the parent cell (-awe- °^ an incn)> the membrane of the parent cell has disap- peared, and thi young cells are separated to a short distance by freshly effused intercellular substance. Nearer still to the punctum ossificationis a more remarkable change has ensued, the energy of cellule reproduction has augmented with proximity to the ossifying point, and each cell, in place of producing two, gives birth to four,6 DEVELOPMENT OP BONE. five, or six young cells, which rapidly destroy the parent membrane and attain a greater size (T-^r<rof an incn) *kan tlie Parent cell> eacn JVflF. 2.* cell being, as in the previous case, separated to a slight extent from its neighbour by intercellular substance. By one other repetition of Fig. 3.t the same process, each cell producing four, five, or six young cells, a cluster is formed, containing from thirty to fifty cells. These * Figures illustrative of the development of bone; magnified 155 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. a.

The clusters become larger towards the right of the figure, and their cells more numerous and larger, of311 mcll> long diameter.7 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. clusters lie in immediate relation with the punctum ossificationis ; they are oval in figure (about of an inch in length by -^-^ in breadth), and elongated in the direction of the long axis of the bone. The cells composing the cluster lie transversely with regard to its axis. In the first instance they are closely compressed, but by degrees are parted by a thin layer of intercellular substance, and each cluster is separated from neighbouring clusters by a broader Fig. 4.* layer (3 2*5 6 of an inch) of intercellular substance. Such are the changes which occur in cartilage preparatory to the formation of bone. Ossification is accomplished by the formation of very fine and de- licate fibres within the intercellular substance : this process com- mences at the punctum ossificationis, and extends from that point through every part of the bone, in a longitudinal direction in long, and in a radiated direction in flat bones. Starting from the punc- tum ossificationis, the fibres embrace each cluster of cells, and then send branches between the individual cells of each group. In this manner the network, characteristic of bone, is formed, while the cells by their conjunction constitute the permanent areolae and Ha- versian canals. With a high magnifying power, the delicate ossific * The same cartilage at the seat of ossification; the clusters of cells are arranged in columns; the intercellular spaces, between the columns, being •32V0 of an inch in breadth. To the right of the figure osseous fibres are seen occupying the intercellular spaces, at first bounding the clusters laterally, then splitting them longitudinally, and encircling each separate cell. The greater opacity of the right-hand border is due to a threefold cause, namely, increase of osseous fibres, opacity of the contents of the cells, and multiplication of oil globules. In the lower part of the figure some attempt has been made to show the texture of the cells.8 PERIODS OF OSSIFICATION. fibres here alluded to are seen themselves to be composed of minute cells having an elliptical form and central nuclei. These cells at- tract into their interior the calcareous salts of the blood, and their nuclei become developed into the future corpuscles of Purkinje. It is possible also that some of the cartilage cells become corpuscles of Purkinje in the fully developed bone. During the progress of the phenomena above described, the con- tents of the cells undergo certain changes. At first, they are trans- parent, then they become granular, and still later opaque, from the presence of amorphous matter mingled with nuclei, nucleoli, and the remains of secondary cells. In the latter state the cells contain an abundance of minute oil globules, which increase in size as the ossific changes advance, and in the newly-formed osseous areolae, have attained the ordinary size of adipose cells. Cartilaginification is complete in the human embryo at about the sixth week; and the first point of ossification is observed in the clavicle at about the fifth week. Ossification commences at the centre, and thence proceeds towards the surface ; in flat bones the osseous tissue radiates between two membranes from a central point towards the periphery, in short bones from a centre towards the circumference, and in long bones from a central portion, diaphysis, towards a secondary centre, epiphysis, situated at each extremity. Large processes, as the trochanters, are provided with a distinct centre of development, which is named apophysis. The growth of bone in length takes place at the extremity of the diaphysis, and in bulk by fresh deposition on the surface ; while the medullary canal is formed and increased by absorption from within. The period of ossification is different in different bones ; the order of succession may be thus arranged :— During the fifth week, ossification commences in the clavicle, lower jaw, and upper jaw. During the sixth week, in the femur, humerus, tibia, radius, and ulna. During the seventh and eighth weeks, in the fibula, frontal, occi- pital, sphenoid, ribs, parietal, temporal, nasal, vomer, palate, ver- tebrae, first three pieces of sacrum, malar, metacarpus, metatarsus, third phalanges of the hands and feet, and ilium. During the third month, in the first and second phalanges of the hands and feet, lachrymal bone, and ischium. During the fifth month, in the mastoid portion of the temporal, ethmoid, inferior turbinated, sternum, os pubis, and last two pieces of sacrum. During the sixth month, in the body and odontoid process of the axis, and in the os calcis. During the seventh month, in the astragalus. During the tenth month, in the cuboid bone and os hyoides.

The ossicula auditus are the only bones completely ossified at birth; the vertebrae are not completed until the five-and-twentieth year. The entire osseous framework of the body constitutes the skeleton, which in the adult man is composed of two hundred and forty-six distinct bones. They may be thus arranged :— - Head .' . *. .... 8 *~ Ossicula auditus ..... 6 Face 14 ' <■ Teeth 32 i —< Vertebral column, including sacrum and coccyx 26 *- Os hyoides, sternum, and ribs . .26 - Upper extremities .... 64 - Lower extremities ..... 62 Sesamoid bones ..... 8 246 The skeleton is divisible into : 1. The vertebral column, or central axis. 2. The head and face, or superior development of the central axis. 3. The hyoid arch. 4. The thoracic arch and upper extre- mities. 5. The pelvic arch and lower extremities.10 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The vertebral column is the first and only rudiment of internal skeleton in the lower Vertebrata, and constitutes the type of that great division of the animal kingdom. It is also the first developed portion of the skeleton in man, and the centre around which all the other parts are produced. In its earliest formation it is a simple cartilaginous cylinder, surrounding and protecting the primitive trace of the nervous system ; but, as it advances in growth and or- ganization, it becomes divided into distinct pieces, which constitute vertebrce. The vertebrae admit of a division into true and false. The true vertebrae are twenty-four in number, and are classed, according to the three regions of the trunk which they occupy, into cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. The false vertebrae consist of nine pieces united into two bones, the sacrum and coccyx. The arrangement of the vertebrae may be better comprehended by means of the accompanying table :— Cliaracters of a Vertebra.—A vertebra consists of a body, two laminae, a spinous process, two transverse processes, and four arti- cular processes. The body is the solid part of the vertebra ; and, by its articulation with adjoining vertebrae, gives strength and support to the trunk. It is flattened above and below, convex in front, and slightly concave behind. Its anterior surface is constricted around the middle, and pierced by numerous small openings, which give pas- sage to nutritious vessels. On its posterior surface is a single irre- gular opening, or several, for the exit of the venae basis vertebrae. The lamince commence upon the sides of the posterior part of the body of the vertebra by two pedicles ; they then expand ; and, arch- ing backwards, enclose a foramen, which serves for the protection of the spinal cord. The upper and lower border of the laminae are rough for the attachment of the ligamenta subflava. The concavities above and below the pedicles are the intervertebral notches. The spinous process stands backwards from the angle of union of the laminae. It is the succession of these projecting processes along the middle line of the back, that has given rise to the common designa- tion of the vertebral column, the spine. The use of the spinous pro- cess is for the attachment of muscles. The transverse processes pro- ject one at each side from the laminae of the vertebra ; they also are intended for the attachment of muscles. The articular processes, True vertebrae 24 7 Cervical, 12 Dorsal, 5 Lumbar. False vertebrae \ 5 Sacrum, 9 | 4 Coccyx.11 CERVICAL VERTEBRAE. four in number, stand upwards and downwards from the laminae, to articulate with the vertebra above and below. Cervical Vertebrae.—In a cer- vical vertebra th e body is smaller Fig. 5. * than in the other regions ; it is thicker before than behind, broad from side to side, concave on the upper surface, and convex below; so that, when articu- lated, the vertebrae lock the one into the other. The lamina are narrow and long, and the included spinal foramen large and triangular. The superior' in- tervertebral notches are slightly deeper than the inferior;, the inferior being the broadest". The spinous process is short and bifid at the extremity, increasing in length from the fourth to the seventh. The transverse processes are also short and bifid, and deeply grooved along the upper surface for the cervical nerves. Piercing the base of the transverse process is the vertebral foramen, + which gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, and Vertebral plexus of nerves. The transverse processes in this region are formed by two small developments, which proceed, the one from the side of the body, the other from the pedicle of the lamina, and unite near their extremities to enclose the circular area of the vertebral foramen. The anterior of these deve- lopments is the rudiment of a cervical rib ; the posterior, the analogue of the transverse processes in the dorsal region. The ex- tremities of these developments are the anterior and posterior tubercle of the transverse process. The articular processes are oblique ; the superior looking upwards and backwards ; the inferior, downwards and forwards. There are three peculiar vertebrae in the cervical region.—The first, or atlas; the second, or axis; and the seventh, or vertebra prominens. The Atlas (named from supporting the head) is a simple ring of * A central cervical vertebra, seen upon its upper surface. 1.

The inter- vertebral notches are peculiar, from being situated behind the articular processes, instead of before them as in the other vertebree. The transverse processes are remarkably large and long, and pierced by the foramen for the vertebral artery. The articular processes are situated on the most bulky and strongest part of the atlas. The superior are oval and concave, and look inwards, so as to form a kind of cup for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are adapted to the nodding movements of the head; the inferior are circular, and nearly horizontal, to permit of the rotatory movements. Upon the inner face of the lateral mass which supports the articular processes, is a small tubercle at each side, to which the extremities of the trans- verse ligament are attached, a ligament which divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal segments; the smaller and anterior, for receiving the odontoid process of the axis; the larger and posterior, to give passage to the spinal cord and its membranes. The Axis (vertebra dentata) is so named from having a process, shaped like a tooth, upon which the head turns as on a pivot. The body is of large size, and supports a strong process, the odontoid, which rises perpendicularly from its upper surface. The odontoid process presents two articulating surfaces; one on its anterior face, * The upper surface of the atlas. 1. The anterior tubercle projecting from the anterior arch. 2.

Upon each side of its apex is a rough depression, for the attach- ment of the alar ligaments; and running down from its base, on the anterior surface of the body of the vertebra, a vertical ridge, with a depression at each side for the at- tachment of the longus colli muscle. The laminae are large and strong, and unite posteriorly to form a long and bifid spinous process, which is concave beneath. The transverse processes are rudimentary, not bifid, and project only so far as to enclose the vertebral foramen, which is directed obliquely outwards instead of perpendicularly as in the other vertebras. The superior articu- lating processes are situated on the body of the vertebra, at each side of the odontoid process. They are circular and nearly horizontal, having a slight inclination outwards. The inferior articulating processes look downwards and forwards, as do the same processes in the other cervical vertebras. The superior intervertebral notch is remarkably shallow, and lies behind the articular process as in the atlas. The lower surface the body is convex, and is received into the concavity upon the upper surface of the third vertebra. The Vertebra prominens, or seventh cervical, approaches in cha- racter the upper dorsal vertebras. It has received its designation from having a very long spinous process, which is single and termi- nated by a tubercle, and forms a projection on the back part of the neck; to the extremity of this process the ligamentum nuchas is attached. The transverse processes are but slightly grooved along the upper surface, have each a small foramen for the transmission of the vertebral vein, and present only a rudimentary bifurcation at their extremity. Sometimes the anterior tubercle represents a small but distinct rib.

The articular processes are vertical, the superior facing directly back- wards, the inferior directly forwards. The peculiar vertebrae in the dorsal region are, the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first dorsal vertebra approaches very closely in character, the last cervical. The body is broad from side to side, and concave above. The superior articular processes are oblique, and the spinous process horizontal. It has an entire articular surface for the first rib, and a half surface for the second. The ninth dorsal vertebra has only ono half articular surface at each side. The tenth has a single entire articular surface at each side. The eleventh and twelfth have each a single entire articular surface at each side; they approach in character, the lumbar vertebras: their transverse processes are very short, trifid at their summit, and have no articulation with the corresponding ribs.

The last lum- bar vertebra differs from the rest in hav- ing the body very much bevelled posteriorly, so as to be thick in front and thin behind, and the transverse process thkk and large. General Considerations.—Viewed as a whole, the vertebral column represents two pyramids applied base to base, the superior being formed by all the vertebra from the second cervical to the last lumbar, the inferior by the sacrum and coccyx. Examined more attentively, it will be seen to be composed of four irregular pyra- mids, applied to each other by their smaller extremities and by their bases. The smaller extremity of the uppermost pyramid is formed by the axis, or second cervical vertebra; and its base, by the first dorsal. The second pyramid is inverted ; having its base at the first dorsal, and the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually enlarges to the fifth lumbar. The fourth pyramid is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. The bodies of the vertebrae are broad in the cervical region; nar- rowed almost to an angle in the middle of the dorsal, and again broad in the lumbar region. The arches are broad and imbricated in the cervical and dorsal regions, the inferior border of each over- lapping the superior of the next; in the lumbar region an interval is left between them. A considerable interval exists between the cranium and atlas, and another between the last lumbar vertebra and sacrum. The spinous processes are horizontal in the cervical, and become gradually oblique in the upper part of the dorsal region. In the middle of the dorsal region they are nearly vertical, and imbricated, * Lateral view of a lumbar vertebra. 1. Tbe body. 2. The pedicle. 3. The superior intervertebral notch. 4.

The transverse processes developed in their most rudimentary form in the axis, gradually increase in length to the first dorsal vertebra. In the dorsal region they pro- ject obliquely backwards, and diminish suddenly in length in the eleventh and twelfth vertebras, where they are very small. In the lumbar region they increase in length to the middle vertebra, and again subside to the last. The transverse processes consist essentially of two parts, the anterior of which in the dorsal region is the rib, while the posterior retains the name of transverse process. In the cervical region these two elements are quite apparent, both by their different points of attachment to the vertebra, and by the vertebral foramen which divides them at their base. In the lumbar region the so-called transverse processes are in reality lumbar ribs, while the transverse processes will be found behind them in a rudimentary state, deve- loped like the true transverse processes in the cervical region, from the superior articular processes. When the anterior and posterior transverse processes are examined in relation with each other, they will be observed to converge ; if they were prolonged they would unite as in the cervical region and enclose a foramen, or they would rest in contact as in the dorsal region, or become consolidated as in the formation of the sacrum. Moreover, the posterior transverse processes are directed upwards, and if they were prolonged, they would come into contact with a small tubercle which is found at the base of the posterior transverse process (in strongly marked vertebras) in the vertebra above. This junction would form a posterior inter- vertebral foramen, as actually occurs in the sacrum. In brief, the lumbar vertebras exhibit those transitional changes which are calcu- lated, by an easy gradation, to convert separate vertebras into a solid bone. The transverse processes of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebras are interesting in a transcendental point of view, as exhibiting a tendency, which exists obscurely in all the rest, to trifurcate. Now, supposing these three branches to be lengthened in order to fulfil their purposes, the anterior would constitute the articulation or union with a rib, while the superior and inferior would join similar branches in the vertebra above and below, and form a posterior intervertebral foramen. The intervertebral foramina formed by the juxtaposition of the intervertebral notches are smallest in the cervical region, and gradu- ally increase to the last lumbar. On either side of the spinous pro- cesses, and extending the whole length of the column, is the verte- bral groove, which is shallow and broad in the cervical, and deeper and narrower in the dorsal and lumbar regions. It lodges the prin- cipal muscles of the back. Viewed from the side, the vertebral column presents several curves, the principal of which is situated in the dorsal region, the concavity looking forwards. In the cervical and lumbar regions the columnDEVELOPMENT OF VERTEBRAE. 17 is convex in front; and in the pelvis an anterior concave curve is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Besides the antero-posterior curves, a slight lateral curve exists in the dorsal m^ffa^arving its convexity towards the right side. j^"^ Development.—The vertebrae are developadbythree primary and, five secondary centres or epiphyses. The^rimary^enireV are, one for each lamella, and one for the body ; the epiphyses, one for the apex of the spinous process, one for that of eadti transverse process, one for the upper and one for the under Surface of the body. Ex- ceptions to this mode of development are met with in the atlas, axis, vertebra prominens, and lumbar vertebrae. The atlas has four centres : one for each lateral mass, one (sometimes two) for the an.- terior arch, and one for the centre of the posterior arch. The tt'xis has five: one (sometimes two) for the body, two for the odontoid process, appearing side by side in its base, and one for each lamella. The vertebra prominens has two additional centres for the anterior or costal segments of the transverse processes, and the lumbar ver- tebral two for the posterior segments of the transverse processes. The primary centres of the vertebrae make their appearance during the seventh or eighth week of embryonic existence, the lamella being somewhat in advance of the body. From the lamella are produced the spinous, transverse, and articular processes, and the sides of the body ; they unite, to complete the arch, one year after birth, and with the body during the fifth year. The epiphyses for the extre- mities of the spinous and transverse processes make their appear- ance at fifteen or sixteen, and become united between twenty and twenty-five. The epiphyses of the body are somewhat later in ap- pearance, and are consolidated between the periods of twenty-five and thirty years of age. The ossific centres, for the lateral masses, of the atlas, appear a the same time as those of the other vertebrae; they unite posteriorly at the end of the second year, by the intervention of the centre for the posterior arch. The one or two centres of the anterior arch ap- pear during the first year, and become consolidated with the lateral pieces during the fifth or sixth year. The axis developes its lateral pieces at the same time as the other vertebrae : they join posteriorly soon after birth, and with the body during the fourth or fifth year. The centres for the body and odontoid process appear during the sixth month, and are consolidated during the third year. The body of the axis is more largely developed at birth than that of the other vertebrae. The costal segments of the vertebra prominens appear during the second month, and become united to the body at the fifth or sixth year ; they sometimes remain permanently separate, and constitute cervical ribs. The transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra has sometimes a distinct centre, which may remain permanently separate, in that case forming a lumbar rib. The ossification of the arches of the vertebrae commences from18 SACRUM. above, and proceeds gradually downwards; hence arrest of develop- ment gives rise to spina bifida, generally in the loins. Ossification of the bodies, on the contrary, commences at the centre, and proceeds from that point towards the extremities of the column; hence imper- fection of the bodies occurs either in the upper or lower vertebrae. Attachment of Muscles.—To the atlas are attached nine pairs of muscles; the longus colli, rectus anticus minor, rectus lateralis, rectus posticus minor, obliquus superior and inferior, splenius colli, levator-anguli scapulas, and first intertransversales. To the axis are attached eleven pairs ; viz., longus colli, inter- transversales, obliquus inferior, rectus posticus major, interspinals, semi-spinalis colli, multifidus spinas, levator anguli scapulae, splenius colli, transversalis cervicis, and scalenus medius. To the remaining vertebras collectively, thirty-one pairs and one single muscle ; viz., posteriorly, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major, serratus posticus superior and inferior, splenius, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, transversalis cervicis, trachelo- mastoideus, complexus, semispinalis dorsi and colli, multifidus spinas, interspinales, intertransversales, levatores costarum : ante- riorly, rectus anticus major, longus colli, scalenus anticus, medius, and posticus, psoas magnus, psoas parvus, quadratus lumborum, diaphragm, obliquus internus and transversalis. The Sacrum is a triangular bone, situated at the lower extremity of the vertebral column, and formed by the consolidation of five false vertebras. It is divi- * The sacrum seen upon its anterior surface. 1, 1. Transverse lines mark- ing the original constitution of the bone of four pieces. 2, 2. Anterior sacral foramina. 3.

At the ex- tremities of these lines, on each side, are the four anterior sacral foramina, which diminish in size from above downwards, and transmit the anteriorSACRUM. 19 sacral nerves. The projection of the superior piece is the sacro- vertebral angle or promontory. The posterior surface is narrower than the anterior, and convex. On the middle line is a rough crest formed by the rudiments of four spinous processes, the fifth remaining undeveloped and exposing the lower termination of the sacral canal. Immediately external to and parallel with the median crest, is a range of five small tubercles which represent the articular processes of the true vertebrae ; beyond these is a shallow groove in which the four posterior Fig. 11.* sacral foramina open, and farther outwards, a range of five tubercles corre- sponding with the poste- rior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The lowest pair of articular tubercles bound on each side the termination of the sacral canal, and send each a process downwards to articulate with the coc- cyx. The two descending processes are the sacral cornua. The posterior sa- cral foramina are smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior sa- cral nerves. Of the pos- terior transverse tubercles the first corresponds with the angle of the superior border of the bone ; the second is small, and enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac articulation ; the third is large, and gives attachment to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament; the fourth and fifth are smaller, and serve for the attachment of the saero-ischiatic ligaments.

C 2SACRUM. 20 ear-shaped (auricular) surface to articulate with the ilium; and in- feriorly a sharp edge, to which the greater and lesser sacro-ischiatic ligaments are attached. On the superior border, in the middle line, is an oval articular surface, corresponding with the under part of the body of the last lumbar vertebra ; and on each side a broad triangular surface, which supports the lumbo-sacral nerve and psoas magnus muscle. Imme- diately behind the vercebral articular surface is the triangular en- trance of the sacral canal; and, on each side of this opening, an articular process, which looks backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrse. In front of each articular process is an intervertebral notch. The inferior extremity of the bone presents a small oval surface which articulates with the coccyx; and on each side, a notch, which, with a corresponding notch in the upper border of the coccyx, forms the foramen for the transmission of the fifth sacral nerve. The sacrum presents some variety in respect of curvature, and of the number of pieces which enter into its structure. The curve is often very slight, and situated only near the lower part of the bone; while in other subjects it is considerable, and occurs at the middle of the sacrum. The sexual differences in the sacrum relate to its greater breadth, and the greater angle which it forms with the rest of the vertebral column in the. female, rather than to any peculiarity in shape. It is sometimes composed of six pieces, more rarely of four, and, occasionally, the first and second pieces remain perma- nently separate. Development.—By twenty-one points of ossification ; five for each of the first three pieces, viz., one for the body, one for each lateral portion, and one for each lamina ; and three for each of the last two, namely, one for the body and one for each lateral portion. In the progress of growth, and after puberty, fourteen epiphysal centres are added, namely, two for the surfaces of each body, one for each auricular surface, and one for the thin edge of each lateral border. Ossification begins in the bodies of the sacral pieces somewhat later than in those of the true vertebrse ; the first three appearing during the eighth and ninth week, and the last two at about the middle of intra-uterine existence. Ossification of the lamellae takes place during the interval between the sixth and ninth month. The epiphyses for the upper and under surface of the bodies are developed during the interval between the fifteenth and eighteenth year;. and for the auricular and marginal piece, after twenty. The two lower verte- bral pieces, although the last to appear, are the first to be com- pleted (between the fourth and fifth year), and unite by their bodies. The union of the bodies takes place from below upwards, and finishes, between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth year, with the first two pieces. Articulation.—With four bones ; the last lumbar vertebra, ossa innominata, and coccyx.21 COCCYX. Attachment of Muscles.—To seven pairs ; in front, piriformis ; on the side, coccygeus ; and behind, gluteus maximus, latissimus dorsi, longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, and multifidus spina3. The Coccyx (kokkv%, cuckoo, resembling a cuckoo's beak) is composed of four small pieces, which form* the caudal termination of the vertebral column. The superior piece is broad, and expands laterally into two transverse processes; it is sur- mounted by an oval articular surface and two cornua, the former to articu- late with the apex of the sacrum, the latter with the sacral cornua. The lateral wings sometimes become con- nected with the sacrum, and convert the -notches for the fifth pair of sacral nerves into foramina. The remaining three pieces diminish in size from above downwards. Development.—By four centres, one for each piece. Ossification com- mences in the first piece soon after birth ; in the second, between five and ten years ; in tne tnira, Be- tween ten and fifteen; and in the fourth, between fifteen and twenty. The pieces unite at an earlier period than the bodies of the sacrum, the first two pieces first, then the third and fourth, and lastly the second and third. Between forty and sixty years, the coccyx be- comes consolidated with the sacrum ; this event taking place later in the female than in the male. Articulations.-—With the sacrum. Attachment of Muscles.—To three pairs, and one single muscle ; gluteus maximus, coccygeus, posterior fibres of the levator ani, and sphincter ani. * Front view of the coccyx. 1,2,3,4.

The skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column^ is divisible into two parts, the cranium and the face ; the former being adapted, by its form, structure, and strength, to contain and protect the brain; the latter, the chief organs of sense. The Cranium is composed of eight separate bones; viz., the Occipital, Two temporal, Two parietal, Sphenoid, Frontal, Ethmoid. Occipital Bone.—This bone is situated at the posterior part and Fig.13.* base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisible into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. External Surface.—Crossing the middle of the bone transversely, from one lateral angle to the other, is a prominent ridge, the superior * External surface of the occipital bone. 1.

In the middle of the ridge is a projection, called the external occipital protuberance; and defending from it a small vertical ridge, the spine. Above and below the superior curved line the surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles; and on either side of the spine is a convexity, the receptaculum cerebelli. About three-quarters of an inch below the superior curved line is another transverse ridge, the inferior curved line, and beneath the latter the foramen magnum. On each side of the foramen magnum, nearer its anterior than its posterior segment, and encroaching somewhat upon the opening, is an oblong articular surface, the condyle, for articulation with the atlas. The condyles approach towards each other anteriorly, their articular surfaces looking downwards and outwards. Directly behind each condyle is an irregular fossa, and a small opening, the posterior condyloid fora- men, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the condyle is the anterior condyloid foramen, for the hypo- glossal nerve; on the outer side of each condyle, a projecting ridge, the transverse process, excavated in front by a notch which forms part of the jugular foramen ; and directly behind the ridge, and forming its posterior boundary, a prominent process, the jugular tubercle* In front of the foramen magnum is a thick square mass, the basilar process, and in the centre of the basilar process a small tubercle for the Attachment of the superior and middle constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Internal Surface.—On the internal surface is a crucial ridge, which divides the bone into four fossae; the two superior or cerebral fossae lodging the posterior lobes of the cerebrum ; the two inferior or, cerebellar, the lateral lobes of the cerebellum. The superior arm of the crucial ridge is grooved for the superior longitudinal sinusy and gives attachment to the falx cerebri; the inferior arm is sharp and prominent for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and slightly grooved for the two occipital sinuses. The transverse ridge gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and is deeply grooved for the lateral sinuses. At the point of meeting of the four arms is a projection, the internal occipital protuberance, which corresponds with the similar process situated on the external surface of the bone. The convergence of the four grooves forms a slightly depressed fossa, upon which rests the torcular Herophili. In the centre of the basilar portion of the bone is the foramen mag- num, oblong in form, and larger behind than before, transmitting the spinal cord, spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral arteries. Upon the lateral margins of the foramen magnum are two rough emi- nences, which give attachment to the odontoid ligaments, and imme- diately above these, the openings of the anterior condyloid foramina. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, grooved on its surface for supporting the medulla oblongata, and along each lateral border for the inferior petrosal sinus. On each side of the foramen * Eetzius remarks that the jugular tubercle is very long in certain mammalia.OCCIPITAL BONE. 24 magnum is a groove, for the termination of the lateral sinus; a smooth surface, which forms part of the jugular fossa; and a pro- jecting process, which divides the two, and is called the jugular eminence. Into the jugular fossa will be seen opening the posterior condyloid foramen. The superior borders are strongly serrated, and assist in forming the lambdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bones by means of the additamentum suture lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of Fig. 14* the temporal bone, and the intervening space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The angles of the occipital bone are, the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is * Internal surface of the occipital bone. 1.

The lata yl angles, at each side, project into the interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.—By seven centres ; four for the four parts of the expanded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the ex- panded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae ; at birth the bone consists of four distinct pieces ; which are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs : to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis ; to the superior curved line, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid ; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis ; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the transverse process, the rectus lateralis ; and to the basilar process, the rectus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle con- strictor muscles.

The superior border is straight, to articulate with its fellow of the opposite side. The inferior border is arched and thin, to articulate with the temporal bone. The anterior border is concave, and the posterior somewhat convex. External Surface.-^-Crossing the bone in a longitudinal direction from the anterior to the posterior border, is an arched line, the temporal ridge, to which the temporal fascia is attached. In the middle of this line, and nearly in the centre of the bone, is the pro- jection called the parietal eminence, which marks the centre of ossification. Above the temporal ridge the surface is rough, and covered by the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis ; below the ridge the bone is smooth {planum semicirculare), for the attachment of the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle. Near the superior border of the bone, and at about one-third from its posterior extremity, is the parietal foramen, which transmits a vein to the superior longi- tudinal sinus. This foramen is often absent. Internal Surface.—The internal table is smooth ; it is marked by numerous furrows, which lodge the ramifications of the arteria meningea media, and by digital fossse which correspond with the * Internal surface of the left parietal bone. 1.

Along the upper border is part of a shallow groove, completed by the opposite parietal bone, which serves to contain the superior longitudinal sinus. Near this groove, some slight pits, which lodge the glandulse Pacchioni, are also observable. The anterior inferior angle is thin and lengthened, and articu- lates with the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. Its inner surface is deeply grooved for the trunk of the arteria meningea media ; the groove being frequently converted into a closed canal. The poste- rior imferior angle is thick, and presents a broad and shallow groove for the lateral sinus. Development.—By a single centre. Ossification commences in the parietal eminence at the same time as in the bodies of the ver- tebrae. Articulations.—With Jive bones; with the opposite parietal, occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles.—To one only, the temporal. The apo- neurosis of the occipito-frontalis glides over its upper surface. Frontal Bone.—The frontal bone bears some resemblance in form to the under valve of a scallop-shell. It is situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead, and assisting in the; construction of the roof of the orbits and nose. Hence it is divisible into a superior or frontal portion, and an inferior or orbito- nasal portion. Each of these portions presents for examination an external and internal surface, borders, and processes. External Surface.—At about the middle of each lateral half of the frontal portion is a projection, the frontal eminence. Below these points are the superciliary ridges, large towards their inner termination, and becoming gradually smaller as they arch outwards : they support the eyebrows. Beneath the superciliary ridges are the sharp and prominent arches which form the upper margin of the orbits, the supraorbital ridges. Externally the supraorbital ridge terminates in the external angular process, internally in the internal angular process; at the inner third of this ridge is a notch, sometimes converted into a foramen, the supraorbital notch, which gives passage to the supraorbital artery, veins, and nerve. Between the two superciliary ridges is a rough projection, the nasal tuberosity; this portion of the bone denotes by its prominence the situation of the frontal sinuses. Extending upwards and back- wards from the external angular process is a sharp ridge, the com- mencement of the temporal ridge, and beneath the ridge, a de- pressed surface, forming part of the temporal fossa. The orbito-nasal portion of the bone consists of two thin pro- cesses, the orbital plates, which form the roof of the orbits, and an intervening notch which lodges the ethmoid bone, and is called the ethmoidal fissure. The edges of the ethmoidal fissure are hollowed into cavities, which, by their union with the ethmoid bone, com-FRONTAL BONE. 28 plete the ethmoidal cells ; and, crossing these edges transversely, are two small grooves, sometimes canals, which open into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramen. At the anterior termination of these edges are the irregular openings which lead into the frontal sinuses ; and between the two internal angular processes is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a project- ing process, the nasal spine. On each orbital plate, immediately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which Fig. 17.* 10 lodges the lachrymal gland ; and beneath the internal angular pro- cess a small pit, sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle is attached. Internal Surface.— Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri, the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid bone, the foramen ccecum. This opening lodges a process of the dura mater, and occasionally gives passage to a small * External surface of the frontal bone. 1. Situation of the frontal eminence of the right side. 2.

On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the glandulse Pacchioni, and on the orbital plates a number of irregular pits called digital fossce, which correspond with the convolutions of the anterior lobes of the cerebrum.

Ossi- fication begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life, frontal suture. The frontal sinuses make their appearance during the first year, and increase in size until old age. Articulations.—With twelve bones : two parietal, sphenoid, eth- moid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To two pairs; corrugator supercilii, and temporal. Temporal Bone.—The temporal bone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The Squamous portion, forming the anterior part of the bone, is thin, translucent, and contains no diploe. On its external surface it is smooth, gives attachment to the fleshy fibres of the temporal * External surface of the temporal bone of the left side. 1. Squamous por- tion. 2. Mastoid portion. 3.

Near the commencement of the zygoma, upon its lower border, is a projection called the tubercle, to which is attached the external lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and continued hori- zontally inwards from the tubercle, a rounded eminence, the eminen- tia articularis. The process of bone which is continued from the tubercle of the zygoma into the eminentia articularis is the inferior root of the zygoma. The superior root is continued upwards from the upper border of the zygoma, and forms the posterior part of the temporal ridge, serving by its projection to mark the division of the squamous from the mastoid portion of the bone; and the middle root is continued directly backwards, and terminates abruptly at a narrow fissure, the fissura Grlaseri. The internal surface of the squamous portion is marked by several shallow fossae, which cor- respond with the convolutions of the cerebrum, and by a furrow for the posterior branch of the arteria meningea media. The superior or squamous border, is very thin, and bevelled at the expense of the inner surface, so as to overlap the lower and arched border of the parietal bone. The inferior border is thick, and dentated to articulate with the spinous process of the sphenoid bone. The Mastoid portion forms the posterior part of the bone ; it is thick and hollowed between its tables into a loose and cellular diploe. On its external surface it is rough for the attachment of muscles, and contrasts strongly with the smooth and polished sur- face of the squamous portion : every part of the surface is pierced by small foramina, which give passage to minute arteries and veins; one of these openings, oblique in direction, of large size, and situ- ated near the posterior border of the bone, the mastoid foramen, transmits a vein to the lateral sinus. Not unfrequently this fora- men is situated in the occipital bone. The inferior part of the mas- toid portion is round and expanded, the mastoid process, and exca- vated in its interior into numerous cells, which form part of the organ of hearing. In front of the mastoid process, and between the superior and middle root of the zygoma, is the large oval opening of the meatus auditorius externus, surrounded by a rough lip, the processus auditorius. Directly to the inner side of, and partly con- cealed by, the mastoid process, is a deep groove, the digastric fossa; and a little more internally the occipital groove, which lodges the occipital artery. On its internal surface the mastoid portion presents a broad and shallow groove (fossa sigmoidea) for the lateral sinus, and terminating in this groove the internal opening of the mastoid foramen. The superior border of the mastoid portion is dentated ; and its posterior border, thick and less serrated, articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone. The meatus auditorius externus is a slightly curved canal, some- what more than half an inch in length, longer along its lower32 TEMPORAL BONE. than its tipper wall, and directed obliquely inwards and forwards. The canal is narrower at tympani. The Petrous portion of the temporal bone is named from its ex- treme hardness and density. It is a three-sided pyramid, project- ing horizontally forwards into the base of the skull, the base being applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, and the apex being received into the triangular interval between the spinous process of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital bone. For convenience of description it is divisible into three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and basilar ; and three bor- ders, superior, anterior, and posterior. The anterior surface, forming the posterior boundary of the middle fossa of the interior of Fig 21 f the base of the skull, 6 presents for examina: * Section of the temporal bone, right side, showing the curved direction of the meatus auditorius externus. 1.

Within the margin of this border is a groove for the insertion of the membrana tion from base to apex, firstly an eminence caused by the projec- tion of the perpendicu- lar semicircular canal; next, a groove leading to an irregular oblique opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the trans- mission of the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve; thirdly, another and smaller oblique foramen, immediately beneath the preceding, for the passage of the33 TEMPORAL BONE. nervus petrosus superficialis minor, a branch of Jacobson's nerve ; and, lastly, a large foramen near the apex of the bone, the termi- nation of the carotid canal. The posterior surface forms the front boundary of the posterior fossa of the base of the skull; near its middle is the oblique entrance of the meatus auclitorius interims. Above the meatus auditorius internus is a small oblique fissure, and a minute foramen ; the former lodges a process of the dura mater, and the foramen gives passage to a small vein. Further outwards, towards the mastoid portion of the bone, is a small slit, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone, this is the aquceductus vestibuli, and transmits a small artery and vein of the vestibule and a process of dura mater. Below the meatus, and partly concealed by the margin of the posterior border of the bone is the aquozductus cochlea, through which passes a vein from the cochlea to the internal jugular vein, and a process of dura mater. The meatus auditorius internus is about one-third of an inch in depth, and pursues a slightly oblique course in relation to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, but a course directly outwards in relation to the cranium. At the bottom of the meatus, and upon its anterior aspect, is a reniform fossa, the con- cave border of which is directed towards the Fi9- 22 •* entrance of the meatus. The reniform fossa is divided into an upper and lower compartment by a sharp ridge, which is prolonged for some dis- tance upon the anterior wall of the meatus, and sometimes as far as its aperture ; this ridge marks the situation of the two nerves of the portion.

Along the convexity of the reniform fossa, and arranged in a curved line from above downwards, are four or five openings, the two upper ones being the largest, and occupying the superior compart- ment, the two or three inferior ones, smaller, the inferior com- partment. Behind the latter, at the distance of a line and a half, and on the posterior wall of the meatus, is a cluster of three or four oblique openings, two of which are minute. The inferior and larger compartment of the reniform fossa presents a well- marked spiral groove, which commences on the convex border of the fossa, immediately below the line of openings above described, and, sweeping round the convexity of the inferior compartment, and becoming deeper as it proceeds, terminates by a small round aperture in the centre of the spire. The uppermost of the openings of the reniform fossa is the aperture of the aquseductus Fallopii, and gives passage to the facial nerve. The rest are cul de sacs, pierced at the bottom by numerous minute foramina for the passage of filaments of the vestibular nerve, while the cluster of three openings on the posterior wall of the meatus is intended for single filaments of the same nerve. The spiral groove corresponds with the base of the cochlea, and being pierced by a number of minute foramina for filaments of the cochlear nerve, is named tractus spi- ralis foraminulentus. The opening in the centre of the spiral impression leads into a canal which occupies the central axis of the modiolus, and is thus called tubulus centralis modioli. The basilar surface of the petrous portion is rough, irregular, and enters into the formation of the under surface of the base of the skull. Projecting downwards, near its middle, is a long sharp spine, the styloid process, occasionally connected with the bone only by cartilage, and lost during maceration, particularly in the young subject.* At the base of this process is a rough sheath-like ridge, into which the styloid process appears implanted, the vaginal pro- cess or tympanic lamina. In front of the vaginal process is a broad triangular depression, the glenoid fossa, bounded in front by the eminentia articularis, behind by the vaginal process, and externally by the rough lip of the processus auditorius. The glenoid fossa is divided transversely by the glenoid fissure (fissura Glaseri), which receives the extremity of the processus gracilis of the malleus, and transmits the laxator tympani muscle, chorda tympani nerve, and anterior tympanic artery. The surface of the fossa in front of the fissure is smooth, to articulate with the condyle of the lower jaw ; and that behind the fissure rough, for the reception of part of the parotid gland. At the extremity of the * Eetzius remarks that the styloid process, which is connected with the lesser cornu of the os hyoides by means of the stylo-hyoidean ligament, belongs in reality to the os hyoides, and completes the hyoid arch; he also notes that the vaginal process or tympanic lamina is a distinct bune in many vertebrata.TEMPORAL BONE. 35 inner angle of the glenoid fossa is the foramen of the Eustachian tube; and separated from it by a thin lamella of bone, called pro- cessus cochleariformis, a small canal for the transmission of the tensor tympani muscle. Directly behind, and at the root of the styloid process, is the •stylo-mastoid foramen, the opening of exit of the facial nerve, and entrance of the stylo'mastoid artery. Nearer the apex of the bone is a large oval opening, the carotid foramen, the commence- ment of the carotid canal, which lodges the internal carotid artery and carotid plexus. And between the stylo-mastoid and carotid foramen, in the posterior border, is an irregular excavation forming part of the jugular fossa for the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The share of the jugular fossa formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone is different in different bones; but in all, the fossa presents a vertical ridge on its inner side, which cuts off a small portion from the rest. The upper part of this ridge forms a spinous projection, the jugular process, the groove to the inner side of the ridge lodges the eighth pair of nerves, and the lower part of the ridge is the septum of division between the jugular fossa and carotid foramen. Upon the latter portion of the ridge near the posterior margin of the carotid foramen is a small opening leading into a canal which transmits the tympanic branch (Jacobson's* nerve) of the glossopharyngeal nerve. And between the jugular fossa and the stylo-mastoid foramen is another small opening leading into the canal for the passage of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve. The superior border of the petrous portion is sharp, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. It is grooved for the supe- rior petrosal sinus, and near its extremity is marked by a smooth notch upon which reclines the fifth nerve. The anterior border is grooved for the Eustachian tube, and forms the posterior boundary of the. foramen lacerum basis cranii; by its sharp extremity it gives attachment to the tensor tympani and levator palati muscle. The posterior border is grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus, and excavated for the jugular fossa : it forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum posterius. Development.—By five centres : one for the squamous portion, one for the mastoid process, one for the pe- trous portion, one for the auditory process, j^g 23 * which in the foetus is a mere bony ring in- complete superiorly, and serving for the attach- ment of the membrana tympani, annulus mem- brance tympani; and one for the styloid process. Ossification occurs in these pieces in the follow- ing order : in the squamous portion immediately after ihe vertebrae, then in the petrous, tympanic, * The annulus membranse tympani or tympanic bone of the foetal skull, right side. $ 236 SPHENOID BONE. mastoid, and styloid. The tympanic ring is united by its extre- mities to the squamous portion during the last month of intra-uterine life ; the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portions are consolidated during the first year ; and the styloid some years after birth. It not unfrequently happens that the latter remains permanently separate, or is prolonged by a series of pieces to the os hyoides, and so com- pletes the hyoid arch. The subsequent changes in the bone are, the increase of size of the glenoid fossa, the growth of the meatus audi- torius externus, the levelling of the surfaces of the petrous portion, and the development of mastoid cells. Traces of the union of the petrous with the squamous portion of the bone are usually percep- tible in the adult. Articulations.—With five bones : occipital, parietal, sphenoid, inferior maxillary, and malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To fourteen: by the squamous portion, to the temporal; by the zygoma, to the masseter ; by the mastoid portion, to the occipito-frontalis, splenius capitis, sterno-mastoid, trachelo-mastoid, digastricus, and retrahens aurem ; by the styloid process, to the stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, and two ligaments, stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary; and, by the petrous portion, to the levator palati, tensor tympani, and stapedius. Sphenoid Bone.—The sphenoid (crffiv, a wedge) is an irregular bone, situated at the base of the skull, wedged between the other bones of the cranium, and entering into the formation both of the cranium and face. It bears some resemblance, in form, to a bat with its wings extended, and is divisible into body, wings, and processes. The body forms the central mass of the bone, from which the wings and processes are projected. From the upper and anterior part of the body extend, one to each side, two small triangular plates, the lesser wings ; from either side and expanding laterally are the greater wings ; proceeding backwards from the base of the greater wings, the spinous processes, and downwards, the pterygoid processes. The body presents for examination a superior or cerebral surface, an anteroinferior surface, and a posterior surface. Superior surface.—At the anterior extremity of this surface is a small projecting plate, the ethmoidal spine, and spreading out on either side the lesser wings. Behind the ethmoidal spine in the » middle line is a rounded elevation, the olivary process, which sup- ports the commissure of the optic nerves ; and on either side of the posterior margin of that process a tubercle, the middle clinoid process. Passing outwards and forwards from the olivary process, are the ojitic foramina, which transmit the optic nerves and ophthalmic arteries. Behind the optic foramina are two sharp tubercles, the anterior clinoid processes, which are the inner termi- nations of the lesser wings. Beneath these processes, on the sides of the olivary process, are two depressions* for the last turn of the * These depressions are occasionally, as in a skull before me, converted intoSPHENOID BONE. 37 internal carotid arteries. Behind the olivary process is the sella turcica (ephippium) the deep fossa which lodges the pituitary gland and circular sinus ; behind and somewhat overhanging the sella turcica, is a broad rough plate (dorsum ephippii) bounded at each angle by a tubercle, the posterior clinoid processes; and behind this plate an inclined surface (clivus Blumenbachii), which is con- tinuous with the basilar process of the occipital bone. On either side of the sella turcica is a broad groove (carotid) which lodges the internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves. IS Immediately external to this groove, at the junction of the greater wings with the body are four foramina : the first is a broad interval, the sphenoidal fissure, which separates the greater and lesser wing, and transmits the third, fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and sixth nerve, and the ophthalmic vein. Behind and beneath this fissure is the foramen rotundum foramina by the extension of a short bony pillar from the middle to the anterior clinoid process. * Superior or cerebral surface of the sphenoid bone. 1.

Behind the foramen ovale, near the apex of the spinous process, is the foramen spinosum for the arteria me- ningea media. Upon the anteroinferior surface of the body of the sphenoid is a long flattened spine or crest, the superior part of which, crista sphenoidalis, articulates with the central lamella of the ethmoid, while the inferior part, longer and sharper, the rostrum sphenoidale, is intended to be inserted into the sheath formed by the upper border of the vomer. On either side of the crista sphenoidalis is an irregular opening leading into the sphenoidal cells. The sphe- noidal cells, absent in the young subject, are divided by a median septum which is continuous with the crista, and are partially closed by two thin plates of bone (frequently broken away) the sphenoidal spongy bones. On each side of the sphenoidal cells are the outlets of the optic foramina, sphenoidal fissures, and foramina rotunda ; the lesser and greater wings ; and, below, the pterygoid processes. At the under surface of the body are two thin plates of bone (pro- cessus vaginales) proceeding from the base of the pterygoid process at each side, and intended for articulation with the border of the vomer. On each of these plates, close to the root of the pterygoid process, is a groove (sometimes a canal) converted into a canal by * Anteroinferior view of the sphenoid bone. 1.

V Fig. 25.*SPHENOID BONE. 39 the palate bone, the pterygo-palatine canal for the pterygopalatine artery ; and traversing the root of the pterygoid process at its union with the body of the bone, is the pterygoid or Vidian canal, which gives passage to the Vidian nerve and artery. The posterior surface of the body is flat and rough, and articu- lates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. In the adult this union is usually completed by bone ; from which circumstance the sphenoid, in conjunction with the occipital, is described by Soemmering and Meckel as a single bone, under the name of spheno- occipital. The posterior surface is continuous at each side with the spinous process, and in the angle of union is the termination of the Vidian canal. The lesser wings (processes of Ingrassias) are thin and triangular, the base being attached to the upper and anterior part of the body of the sphenoid; and the apex, prolonged outwards, terminating in an acute point. The anterior border is irregularly serrated, the posterior being free and rounded, and received into the fissure of Sylvius of the cerebrum. The inner extremity of this border is the anterior clinoid process, which is supported by a short pillar of bone, giving attachment to part of the common tendon of the muscles of the orbit. The lesser wing forms the posterior part of the roof of the orbit, and its base is traversed by the optic foramen. The greater wings present three surfaces ; a superior or cerebral, which forms part of the middle fossa of the base of the skull; an anterior surface, which assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit; and an external surface, divided into two parts by the pterygoid ridge. The superior part of the external surface enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, the inferior portion forms part of the zygomatic fossa. The pterygoid ridge, dividing the two, gives attachment to the upper origin of the pterygoideus externus muscle. The spinous processes project backwards, one at each side, from the base of the greater wings of the sphenoid, and are received into the angular interval between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bones. Piercing the base of each process is a large oval opening, the foramen ovale ; nearer its apex a smaller opening, the foramen spinosum; and extending downwards from the apex, a short spine, which gives attachment to the internal lateral liga- ment of the lower jaw and to the laxator tympani muscle. The external border of the spinous process is rough, to articulate with the lower border of the squamous portion of the temporal bone ; the internal border forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and is somewhat grooved for the reception of the Eustachian tube. The pterygoid processes descend perpendicularly from the base of the greater wings, and form in the articulated skull the lateral boundary of the posterior nares. Each process consists of an ex- ternal and internal plate, and an anterior surface. The external40 ETHMOID BONE. plate is broad and thin, giving attachment, by its external surface, to the external pterygoid nmscle, and by its internal surface to the internal pterygoid. This plate is sometimes pierced by a foramen, which is not unfrequently formed by a process of communication passing between it and the spinous process. The internal 'ptery- goid plate is long and narrow, and terminated at its extremity by a curved hook, the hamular process, around which plays the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. At the base of the internal pterygoid plate is a small oblong depression, the scaphoid fossa, from which arises the circumflexus or tensor palati muscle. The interval be- tween the two pterygoid plates is the pterygoid fossa ; and the two plates are separated inferiorly by an angular notch (palatine) which receives the tuberosity, or pterygoid process, of the palate bone. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is broad near its base, and supports Meckel's ganglion. The base of the process is pierced by the Vidian canal. '^Development.—By twelve centres ; four for the body, viz., two ^ for its anterior (spheno-orbital), and two for its posterior part (spheiip-jtemporal); four for the four vfings ; two for the internal pterygoid plates,- and two for the sphenoidal spongy bones. Ossifi- ■ cation commences in the various pieces of the sphenoid in the fol- . lowing order :—greater alae, at about the same time with the other vbories of the cranium ; lesser alse and posterior body, at the end of the second month ; anterior body at the end of the third ; internal pterygoid plate and spongy bones, between the period of birth and the second year. Osseous union occurs first between the centres for the posterior body, and at about the same time between each centre of the anterior body and its corresponding (lesser) ala ; the third union takes place between the internal pterygoid plate and the greater ala ; the fourth, between the two centres of the anterior body, and at the same time between the anterior and posterior body. This is the state of union at birth, the bone consisting of five centres, one being the body and lesser alse ; one, on each side, the great ala and internal pterygoid plate ; and the remaining two, the sphenoidal spopgy bones. The greater alse unite with the body during the first year ; the spongy bones after puberty ; and the body of the sphenoid with the basilar process of the occipital bone between eighteen and twenty-five. Articidations.—With twelve bones : that is, with all the bones of the head, and five of the face, viz., two malar, two palate, and vomer. Attachment of Muscles.—To ttvelve pairs : temporal, external pterygoid, internal pterygoid, superior constrictor, tensor palati, laxator tympani, levator palpebrse, obliquus superior, superior rectus, internal rectus, inferior rectus, and external rectus. Ethmoid Bone.—The ethmoid (rjdfxbs, a sieve) is a square-shaped cellular bone, situated between the two orbits, at the root of theETHMOID BONE. 41 nose, and perforated on its upper surface by a number of small openings, from which peculiarity it has received its name. It con- sists of a perpendicular lamella and two lateral masses. The perpendicular lamella is a thin central plate, which articu- lates with the vomer and cartilage of the septum, and assists in forming the septum of the nose. It is surmounted superiorly by a thick and strong process, the crista galli, which projects into the cavity of the skull, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri. From the base of the anterior border of this process there project forward two small plates, alar processes, which are received into corre- sponding depressions in the frontal bone, and often complete pos- teriorly the foramen caecum. At each side of the crista galli, on the upper surface of the bone, is a thin and grooved plate perforated with a number of small openings, the cribriform lam^^3j^eUQh. supports the bulb of the olfactory nerve, and gives.; passage to itfN filaments, and to the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nen|jj. j|s' t^e middle of the groove of this lamella w ^ the foramina pierce the bone com- pletely, but at either side they are the apertures of canals, which run for some distance in the substance of the central lamella, inner wall of the lateral mass, and spongy bonesi The opening for the nasal nerve is a narrow slit in the ante- rior part of the cribriform lamella, close to the crista galli. The cribri- form lamella serves to connect the lateral masses with the perpendi- cular plate. The lateral masses (labyrinthi) are divisible into an internal and external surface, and four borders, superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior. The internal surface is rough, slightly convex, and forms the external boundary of the upper part of the nasal fossaa. Towards the posterior border of this surface is a narrow horizontal fissure, the superior meatus of the nose ; the upper margin of this fissure is * Ethmoid bone, seen from above and behind. 1.

Below the meatus is the convex surface of another thin plate, which is curled outwards, and forms the lower border of the mass, the middle turbinated bone (concha media). The external surface is quadrilateral and smooth; hence it is named os planum, and, from its thinness, lamina papyracea ; it enters into the formation of the inner wall of the orbit. The superior border is uneven and cellular, the cells being com- pleted by the edges of the ethmoidal fissure of the frontal bone. This border is crossed by two grooves, sometimes complete canals, opening into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramen. The inferior border is formed internally by the lower border of the middle turbinated bone, and externally by a concave irregular fossa, the upper boundary of the middle meatus. The anterior border presents a number of incomplete cells, which are closed by the superior maxillary and lachrymal bone ; the posterior border is irregularly cellular, to articulate with the sphenoid and palate bone. The lateral masses are composed of cells, divided by a thin par- tition into anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The anterior, the most numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses, and open by means of an irregular and incomplete tubular canal, the infundi- bulum, into the middle meatus. The posterior cells, fewer in number, open into the superior meatus. Development.—By three centres : one for each lateral mass, and one for the perpendicular lamella. Ossification commences in the lateral masses at about the beginning of the fifth month, appearing first in the os planum, and then in the spongy bones. During the latter half of the first year after birth, the central lamella and lamina cribrosa begin to ossify, and are united to the lateral masses by the beginning of the second year. The cells of the ethmoid are developed in the course of the fourth and fifth year. Articulations.—With thirteen bones : two of the cranium, froutal and sphenoid; and eleven of the face, viz., nasal, superior maxil- lary, lachrymal, palate, inferior turbinated, and vomer. No muscles are attached to this bone. BONES OF THE PACE. The face is composed of fourteen bones ; namely, Two nasal, Two palate, Two superior maxillary, Two inferior turbinated, Two lachrymal, Vomer, Two malar, Inferior maxillary. Nasal Bones.—The nasal are two small quadrangular bones, forming by their union the bridge and base of the nose. On the upper surface they are convex, and pierced by a foramen for a smallSUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. 43 Fig. 27* artery ; on the under surface they are somewhat concave, and marked by a groove, which lodges the nasal branch of the ophthal- mic nerve. The superior border is narrow and thick, the inferior broad, thin, and irre- gular. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, the first ossific deposition making its appearance at the same time as in the ver- tebrae. Articulations.—With four bones : fron- tal, ethmoid, nasal, and superior maxil- lary. Attachment of Muscles. — It has in relation with it the pyramidalis nasi and compressor naris; but neither is inserted into it. Superior Maxillary Bones.—The superior maxillary are the largest bones of the face, with the exception of the lower jaw ; they form, by their union, the whole of the upper jaw, and assist in the construction of the nose, orbit, cheek, and palate. Each bone is divisible into a body and four processes. The body is triangular in form, and hollowed in its interior into a large cavity, the antrum maxillare (antrum of Highmore). It presents for examination four sur- faces, external or facial, internal g' 28 ^ or nasal, posterior or zygomatic, and superior or orbital. The external, or facial surface, forms the anterior part of the bone ; it is irregularly concave, and presents a deep depression towards its centre, the canine fossa, which gives attachment to two muscles, compressor nasi and levator anguli oris. Immediately above this fossa is the infra- orbital foramen, the termination of the infraorbital canal, trans- mitting the superior maxillary nerve and infraorbital artery ; and above the infraorbital foramen is the lower margin of the orbit, * Nasal bone of the left side; its external or convex surface. 1.

Towards the middle line of the face the external surface is bounded by the concave border of the opening of the nose, this border is projected forwards at its inferior termination into a sharp process, forming, with a similar process of the opposite bone, the nasal spine. Beneath the jpig^ 29.* nasal spine, and above the two superior incisor teeth, is a slight depression, the in- cisive, or myrtiform fossa, which gives origin to the depressor labii superioris alseque nasi muscle. The myrtiform fossa is divided from the canine fossa by a perpendicular ridge, corre- sponding with the root of the canine tooth. The in- ferior boundary of the facial surface is the alveolar pro- cess which contains the teeth of the upper jaw ; and the facial is separated from the zygomatic surface by a strong projecting eminence, the ma- lar process. The internal, or nasal sur- face, presents a large irregu- lar opening, leading into the antrum maxillare ; this opening is nearly closed in the articulated skull by the ethmoid, palate, lachrymal, and inferior turbinated bone.

On its inner wall are numerous grooves, lodging branches of the superior maxillary nerve, and projecting into its floor several conical processes, corresponding with the roots of the first and second molar tooth. In front of the opening of the antrum is the strong ascending plate of the nasal process, marked inferiorly by a rough horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis inferior), which gives attachment to the inferior turbinated bone. The concave depression immediately above this ridge corresponds with the middle meatus of the nose, that below the ridge with the inferior meatus. Between the nasal process and the opening of the antrum is a deep vertical groove (sulcus lachrymalis), converted into a canal by the lachrymal and inferior turbinated bone, and constituting the nasal duct. The superior border of the nasal surface is irregularly cellular, and ar- ticulates with the lachrymal and ethmoid bone ; theposterior border is rough, and articulates with the palate bone; the anterior border is sharp, and forms the free margin of the opening of the nose; and, from the inferior border, projects inwards a strong horizontal plate, the palate process. The posterior surface may be called zygomatic, as forming part of the zygomatic fossa ; it is bounded externally by the malar pro- cess, and internally by a rough and rounded border, the tuberosity, which is pierced by a number of small foramina (foramina alveolaria posteriora), giving passage to the posterior dental nerves and branches of the superior dental artery. The lower part of this tuberosity presents a rough oval surface, to articulate with the palate bone, and immediately above and to the inner side of this articular surface a smooth groove, which forms part of the posterior palatine canal. The superior border is smooth and rounded, form- ing the lower boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure, and marked by a notch, the commencement of the infraorbital canal. The in- ferior boundary is the alveolar process, containing the last two molar teeth. The orbital surface is triangular and thin, and constitutes the floor of the orbit. It is bounded internally by an irregular edge, which articulates with the palate, ethmoid, and lachrymal bone ; posteriorly, by the smooth border which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure ; and, anteriorly, by a convex mar- gin, partly smooth and partly rough, the smooth portion forming part of the lower border of the orbit, the rough portion articulating with the malar bone. The middle of this surface is channelled by a deep groove and canal, the infraorbital, which terminates at the infraorbital foramen ; and near the root of the nasal process is a slight depression, marking the origin of the inferior oblique muscle of the eyeball. The four processes of the superior maxillary bone are, the nasal, malar, alveolar, and palate. The nasal process ascends by the side of the nose, to which itSUPERIOK MAXILLARY BONES. 40 forms the lateral boundary, and articulates with the frontal and nasal bone. By its external surface it gives attachment to the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and to the orbicularis palpe- brarum muscle. Its internal surface contributes to form the outer wall of the nares, and is marked transversely by a horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis superior), which divides it into two portions, one above the ridge irregular and uneven, for giving attachment to and completing the cells of the lateral mass of the ethmoid ; the other below, smooth and concave, corresponding with the middle meatus. The posterior border is thick and grooved for the nasal duct; while the prominent margin in front of that groove is continuous with the lower border of the orbit; this margin is marked by a small tubercle, which serves as a guide to the introduction of the knife in the ope- ration for fistula lachrymalis. The malar process, large and irregular, is situated at the angle of separation between the facial and zygomatic surface, and presents a triangular surface for articulation with the malar bone. The alveolar process forms the lower margin of the bone ; it is spongy and cellular in texture, and excavated into deep holes for the reception of eight teeth. The palate process is thick and strong, and projects horizontally inwards from the inner surface of the body of the bone. Superiorly, it is concave and smooth, and forms the floor of the nares; in- feriorly, it is also concave, but uneven, and assists in the formation of the roof of the palate. The latter surface is marked by a deep groove, which lodges the anterior palatine nerve and superior pala- tine artery. Its internal edge is raised into a ridge (crista nasalis), which, with a corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove for the reception of the vomer. The prolongation of this ridge forwards beyond the level of the facial surface of the bone is the nasal spine. At the anterior extremity of its nasal surface is a foramen^ which leads into a canal formed conjointly by the two superior maxillary bones, the anterior palatine canal. The termi- nation of this canal is situated immediately behind the incisor teeth, hence it is also named the incisive foramen. Associated with the incisive canal are two smaller canals, the naso-palatine, which transmit the naso-palatine nerves. The naso-palatine canals are situated in the walls of the incisive canal, and terminate inferiorly in that canal, either by separate openings or conjoined. Development.—By four centres: one for the anterior part of the palate and incisive portion of the alveolar process (the permanence of this piece constitutes the intermaxillary bone of animals) ; one for that portion of the bone lying internally to the infraorbital canal and foramen ; one for that portion lying externally to the infra- orbital groove and canal; and one for the palate process. The superior maxillary bone is one of the earliest to show signs of ossifi- cation, this action beginning in the alveolar process, and being associated with the early development of teeth. The early develop-47 MALAR BONES. inent of the alveolar process, and the consequent fusion at this point of the original pieces, 'explains the difficulties which have been felt by anatomists in determining the precise number of ossifying centres of the bone. Articulations.—With nine bones ; viz., two of the cranium, and all the bones of the face, excepting the inferior maxillary. These are, frontal and ethmoid ; nasal, lachrymal, malar, inferior turbi- nated/ palate, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To ten; orbicularis palpebrarum, obli- quus inferior oculi, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, levator labii snperioris proprius, levator anguli oris, compressor naris, dilatator naris, depressor alse nasi, buccinator, masseter. Lachrymal Bones (os unguis, from an imagined resemblance to a finger nail).—The lachrymal is a thin oval-shaped plate of bone, situated in front and at the inner angle of the orbit. It may be divided into an external and internal surface and four borders. The external surface is Fig. 30.* smooth and marked by a vertical ridge, the lachrymal crest, into two portions, one of which is flat and enters into the formation of the orbit, hence may be called the orbital portion ; the other is concave, and lodges the lachrymal sac, hence, the lachrymal portion. The crest is expanded inferiorly into a hook- shaped process (hamulus lachrymalis), which forms part of the outer boundary of the fossa lachrymalis. The internal surface is uneven, and completes the anterior ethmoid cells; it assists also in forming the wall of the nasal fossae and nasal duct. The four borders articulate with adjoining bones. Development.—By a single centre, appearing in the early part of the third month. Articulations.—With four bones; two of the cranium, frontal and ethmoid ; and two of the face, superior maxillary and. inferior turbinated bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To owe muscle, the tensor tarsi, and to an expansion of the tendo oculi, the former arising from the orbital surface, the other being attached to the lachrymal crest. Malar Bones (mala, the cheek).—The malar (os jugale) is the strong quadrangular bone which forms the prominence of the cheek. * Lachrymal bone of the right side viewed on its external or orbital surface. 1.

The external surface is smooth and convex, and pierced by several small openings, which give passage to filaments of the temporo-malar nerve and minute arteries. The internal surface is concave, partly smooth and partly rough; smooth where Fig. 3i .* it forms part of the temporal fossa, and rough where it ar- ticulates with the superior maxillary bone. Thefrontalprocess ascends perpendicularly to form the outer border of the orbit, and articulate with the external angular process of the frontal bone. The orbital process is a thick plate, which projects inwards from the frontal process, and unites with the great ala of the sphenoid to constitute the outer wall of the orbit. It is pierced by several small foramina for the passage of temporo- malar filaments of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary process is broad, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. The zygomatic process, narrower than the rest, projects backwards to unite with the zygoma of the temporal bone. Development.—By a single centre ; in rare instances by two or three. In many animals the malar bone is permanently divided into two portions, orbital and malar. Ossification commences in the malar bone soon after the vertebrae. Articulations.—With four bones; three of the cranium, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid; and one of the face, superior maxillary. Attachment of Muscles.—To five: levator labii superioris pro- prius, zygomaticus minor and major, masseter, and temporal. Palate Bone.—The palate bones are situated at the posterior part of the nares, where they enter into the formation of the palate, side of the nose, and posterior part of the floor of the orbit; hence they might be named the palato-naso-orbital bones. Each bone re- sembles in general form the letter L, and is divisible into a hori- zontal plate, a perpendicular plate, and a pterygoid process or tuberosity. * Malar bone of the right side. 1.

The horizontal plate is quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, one superior, which enters into the formation of the floor of the nares, the other inferior, forming the posterior part of the hard palate. The superior surface is con- cave, and rises towards the middle line, where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side and forms part of a crest (crista nasalis), which articulates with the vomer. The inferior surface is uneven, and marked by a slight trans- verse ridge, to which is attached the tendinous expansion of the tensor palati muscle. Near its external border are two openings, one large and one small, the posterior palatine foramina ; the former transmits the anterior palatine nerve and superior palatine artery, the 4 latter the middle palatine nerve. The posterior border is concave, and pre- sents at its inner extremity a sharp point, which, with a corresponding point in the opposite bone, con- stitutes the palate spine for the attachment of the azygos uvulae muscle. The perpendicular plate is also quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, one internal or nasal, forming part of the wall of the nares ; the other external, bounding the spheno-maxillary fossa and antrum. The internal surface is marked near its middle by a hori- zontal ridge (crista turbinalis inferior), to which is united the in- ferior turbinated bone; and, about half an inch above this, by another ridge (crista turbinalis superior), for the attachment of the middle turbinated bone. The concave surface below the inferior ridge is the lateral boundary of the inferior meatus of the nose ; that between the two ridges corresponds with the middle meatus, and the surface above the superior ridge with the superior meatus. The external surface, extremely irregular, is rough on each side for articulation with neighbouring bones, and smooth in the middle to * Posterior view of the right palate bone in its natural position; it is slightly turned on one side, to obtain a sight of the internal surface of the perpendicular plate (2). 1.

EPALATE BONES. 50 Fig. 33* constitute the inner boundary of the spheno-maxiliary fossa. This smooth surface terminates inferiorly in a deep groove, which, being completed by the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid, forms the posterior palatine canal. Near the upper part of the perpendicular plate is a large oval notch completed by the sphenoid, the spheno-palatine foramen, which transmits the superior nasal and naso-palatine nerves and spheno-palatine artery, and serves to divide the upper extremity of the bone into two portions, an anterior or orbital, and a posterior or sphenoidal portion. The orbital portion is hollow within, and presents five surfaces externally, three articular, and two free ; the three articular are, anterior, which looks forward and articulates with the superior maxillary bone, internal with the ethmoid, and posterior with the sphenoid. The free surfaces are, superior or orbital, which forms the posterior part of the floor of the orbit, and external, which looks into the spheno-maxillary fossa. The sphenoidal portion, much smaller than the orbital, has three surfaces, two lateral and one superior. The external lateral surface enters into the formation of the spheno- maxillary fossa ; the internal lateral forms part of the lateral boundary of the nares ; the superior surface arti- culates with the under part of the body of the sphenoid bone, and assists the sphenoidal spongy bones in closing the sphenoidal sinuses. This portion takes part in the formation of the pterygo-palatine canal. The pterygoid p>rocess or tuberosity of the palate bone is the thick and rough process which stands backwards from the angle of union of the hori- zontal with the perpendicular portion of the bone. It is received into the angular fissure, which exists between the two plates of the pterygoid process at their inferior extremity, and presents three surfaces : one concave and smooth, which forms part of the ptery- * Perpendicular plate of the right palate bone, seen on its external or spheno-maxillary surface. 1.

The anterior face of this process is rough, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. Development.—By a single centre, which appears in the angle of union between the horizontal and perpendicular portion, at the same time as ossification in the vertebras. Articulations.—With six bones : two of the cranium, sphenoid and ethmoid ; and four of the face, superior maxillary, inferior turbinated, vomer, and the palate bone of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To four: tensor palati, azygos uvulae, internal and external pterygoid. Inferior Turbinated Bones.—The inferior turbinated or spongy bone, is a thin layer of light and porous bone, attached to the crista turbinalis inferior of the inner wall of the nares, and pro- jecting inwards towards the septum narium. It is some- what triangular in form, one angle being directed upwards and the curved base down- wards ; and slightly curled upon itself, so as to bear some resemblance to one valve of a bivalve shell, hence its desig- nation, concha inferior. The bone presents for examination, two surfaces, internal and external ; three borders, anterior, supe- rior, and inferior; and three angles, anterior, posterior, and supe- rior. The internal or convex surface looks inwards and upwards, and forms the inferior boundary of the middle meatus naris ; it is marked by one or two longitudinal grooves or canals for branches of the nasal nerves and spheno-palatine artery. The external or concave surface looks downwards and outwards, and constitutes the roof of the inferior meatus. The anterior border looks up- wards and forwards, is thin and somewhat concave, and articulates with the crista turbinalis of the superior maxillary and with the lachrymal bone. The superior border, long and uneven, articu- lates with the crista turbinalis of the palate bone, and with the superior maxillary. The inferior border is convex, rounded, and free, and thicker than the rest of the bone. The anterior angle, * Inferior turbinated bone of the right side. 1, 1.

The posterior angle, sharp and pointed, is prolonged backwards on the internal pterygoid plate. The superior angle, more or less rounded, gives origin to three thin and laminated processes. The most anterior of these processes, processus lachrymalis, derived from the upper extremity of the anterior border, articulates with the lachrymal bone, and. assists in completing the nasal duct; the posterior process, pro- cessus ethmoidalis, derived directly from the superior angle or border, often from both, articulates with the ethmoid bone ; the middle process, processus maxillaris, proceeding also from the superior border, is reflected downwards, and assists in completing the inner wall of the antrum, articulating with the superior maxil- lary and palate bone. Development.—By a single centre, which appears at about the middle of the first year. It affords no attachment to muscles. Articulations.—With four bones : ethmoid, superior maxillary, lachrymal, and palate. Vomer.—The vomer is a thin, quadrilateral plate of bone, form- ing the posterior and inferior part of the septum of the nares. The superior border is broad and expanded, to articulate, in the middle, with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and on each side (ala) with the processus vaginalis of the pterygoid pro- cess. The anterior part of this border is hol- lowed into a sheath for the reception of the rostrum of the sphenoid. The inferior border is thin and uneven, and is received into the grooved summit of the crista nasalis. The posterior border is sharp and free, and forms the posterior division of the two nares. The anterior border is more or less deeply grooved for the reception of the central lamella of the ethmoid and the cartilage of the septum. This groove is an indication of the early constitution of the bone of two lamellse, united at the inferior * The vomer viewed on its left aspect. 1,1. Its superior border, with the two alas. 2, 2.

The vomer not unfrequently presents a convexity to one or the other side, generally, it is said, to the left. Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance at the same time with those of the vertebra?. Ossification begins from below and proceeds upwards. At birth, the vomer presents the form of a trough, in the concavity of which the cartilage of the septum nasi is placed; it is this disposition which subsequently enables the bone to embrace the rostrum of the sphenoid. The vomer has no muscles attached to it. Articulations.—With six bones : sphenoid, ethmoid, two supe- rior maxillary, two palate ; and the cartilage of the septum. Inferior Maxillary Bone.—The lower jaw is the arch of bone which contains the inferior teeth ; it is divisible into a horizontal portion or body, and a perpendicular portion, the ramus, at each side. Upon the external surface of the body of the bone, at the middle line, and extending from between the two first incisor teeth to the chin, is a slight ridge, crista mentalis, which indicates the point of conjunction of the lateral halves of the bone in the young subject, the symphisis. Immediately external to this ridge is a depression which gives origin to the depressor labii inferioris muscle ; and, corresponding with the root of the lateral incisor tooth, another de- pression, the incisive fossa, for the levator labii inferioris. Farther outwards is an oblique opening, the mental foramen, for the exit of the mental nerve and inferior dental artery ; and below this foramen, the commencement of an oblique ridge, which runs up- wards and outwards to the base of the coronoid process, and gives attachment to the depressor anguli oris, platysma myoides, and buccinator muscle. Near the posterior part of this surface is a rough impression made by the masseter muscle ; and, immediately in front of this impression, a groove for the facial artery. The pro- jecting tuberosity at the posterior extremity of the lower jaw, at the point where the body and ramus meet, is the angle. Upon the internal surface of the body of the bone, at the sym- phisis, are two small pointed tubercles; immediately beneath these, two other tubercles, less marked ; beneath them, a ridge, and be- neath the ridge two rough depressions of some size. These four points give attachment, from above downwards, to the genio-hyo- glossi, genio-hyoidei, part of the mylo-hyoidei, and digastric muscles. Running outwards into the body of the bone from the above ridge is a prominent line, the mylo-hyoidean ridge, which gives attachment to the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and by its extremity to the pterygo-maxillary ligament and superior constrictor muscle. Immediately above the ridge, and by the side of the symphisis, is a smooth concave surface, which corresponds with the sublingual gland ; and below the ridge, and more externally, a deeper fossa for the submaxillary gland.INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 54 The superior border of the body of the bone is the alveolar pro- cess, furnished in the adult with alveoli for sixteen teeth. The inferior border or base is rounded and smooth ; thick and everted in front to form the chin, and thin behind where it merges into the angle of the bone. The ramus is a strong square-shaped process, differing in direc- tion at various periods of life ; thus, in the foetus and infant, it is almost parallel with the body ; in youth it is oblique, and gradually approaches the vertical direction until manhood ; in old age, after the loss of the teeth, it again declines, and assumes the oblique direction. On its external surface it is rough, for the attachment ' of the masseter muscle ; and at the junction of its posterior border with the body of the bone, it has a rough tuberosity, the angle of the lower jaw, which gives attachment by its inner margin to the stylo-maxillary ligament. The upper extremity of the ramus presents two processes, sepa- rated by a concave sweep, the sigmoid notch. The anterior is the bone. The constriction around the base of the condyle is its neck, into which is inserted the external pterygoid muscle. The sigmoid notch is crossed by the masseteric artery and nerve. The internal surface of the ramus is marked near its centre by a large oblique foramen, the inferior dental, for the entrance of the inferior dental artery and nerve into the dental canal. Bounding this opening is a sharp margin, to which is attached the internal * The lower jaw. 1. Body. 2. Eamus. 3. Symphisis. 4. Fossa for the depressor labii inferioris muscle. 5. Mental foramen. 6.

To the uneven surface above and in front of the inferior dental foramen, is attached the temporal muscle, and to that below it, the internal pterygoid. The internal surface of the neck of the condyle gives attachment to the external pterygoid muscle ; and the angle to the stylo-maxillary ligament. Development.—By two centres; one for each lateral half, the. two sides meeting at the symphisis, where they become united. The lower jaw is the earliest of the bones of the skeleton to exhibit ossification, with the exception of the clavicle ; ossific union of the symphisis takes place during the first year. Articulations.—With the glenoid fossae of the two temporal bones, through the medium of a fibro-cartilage. A ttachment of Muscles.—To fourteen pairs ; by the external surface, commencing at the symphisis and proceeding outwards, levator labii inferioris, depressor labii inferioris, depressor anguli oris, platysma myoides, buccinator, and masseter ; by the internal surface also commencing at the symphisis, the genio-hyo-glossus, genio-hyoideus, mylo-hyoideus, digastricus, superior constrictor, temporal, external pterygoid, and internal pterygoid.

The bones of the cranium and face are connected with each other by means of sutures (sutura, a seam), of which there are four prin- cipal varieties : serrated, squamous, harrnonia, and schindylesis. The serrated suture is formed by the union of two borders possess- ing serrated edges, as in the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoidal sutures.SUTURES—OSSA TEIQUETRA. 56 In these sutures the serrations are formed almost wholly by the ex- ternal table, the edges of the internal table lying merely in apposition. The squamous suture (squama, a scale) is formed by the over- lapping of the bevelled edges of two contiguous bones, as in the articulation between the temporal and lower border of the parietal. In this suture the approximated surfaces are roughened, so as to adhere mechanically with each other. The harmonia suture (apeiv, to adapt) is the simple apposition of contiguous surfaces, the surfaces being more or less rough and retentive. This suture is seen in the connexion between the supe- rior maxillary bones, or of the palate processes of the palate bones with each other. The schindylesis suture ((xx^vKyjcns, a fissure) is the reception of one bone into a sheath or fissure of another, as occurs in the arti- culation of the rostrum of the sphenoid with the vomer, or of the latter with the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid, and with the crista nasalis of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The serrated suture is formed by the interlocking of the radiating fibres along the edges of the flat bones of the cranium during growth. When this process is retarded by overdistention of the head, as in hydrocephalus, and sometimes without any such apparent cause, distinct ossific centres are developed in the interval between the edges ; and, being surrounded by the suture, form independent pieces which are called ossa triquetra, or ossa Wormiana. In the lambdoidal suture there is generally one or more of these bones ; and, in an adult hydrocephalic skeleton* in the College of Surgeons, there are upwards of one hundred. The coronal suture (fig. 37) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, from the upper part of the greater wing of the sphe- noid of one side to the same point on the opposite side ; it connects the frontal with the parietal bones. In the formation of this suture the edges of the articulating bones are bevelled, so that the parietal rest on the frontal at each side, and in the middle the frontal rests on the parietal bones ; they thus afford to each other mutual support and increased consolidation to the skull. The sagittal suture extends longitudinally backwards along the vertex of the skull, from the middle of the coronal to the apex of the lambdoidal suture. It is much serrated, and serves to unite the two parietal bones. In the young subject, and sometimes in the adult, this suture is continued, through the middle of the frontal bone to the root of the nose, under the name of frontal suture. Ossa triquetra are sometimes found in the sagittal suture. The lambdoidal suture is named from some resemblance to the Greek letter A, consisting of two branches, which diverge at an acute angle from the extremity of the sagittal suture. This suture connects the occipital with the parietal bones. At the posterior and inferior * This skeleton belonged to Mr. Liston.SUPERIOR REGION OF THE SKULL. 57 angle of the parietal bones, the lambdoidal suture is continued on- wards in a curved direction to the base of the skull, and serves to unite the occipital bone with the mastoid portion of the temporal, under the name of adclitamentum suturce lambdoidalis. It is in the lambdoidal suture that ossa triquetra occur most frequently. The squamous suture (fig. 37) unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone with the greater ala of the sphenoid, and with the parietal, overlapping the lower border of the latter. The portion of the suture which is continued backwards from the squamous portion of the bone to the lambdoidal suture, and connects the mastoid portion with the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, is the additamentum suturce squamosce. The additamentum suturse lambdoidalis, and additamentum suturse squamosse, constitute together the mastoid suture. Across the upper part of the face is an irregular suture, the transverse, which connects the frontal bone with the nasal, superior maxillary, lachrymal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and malar bones. The remaining sutures are not sufficiently important to deserve parti- cular names or description. REGIONS OP THE SKULL. The1 skull, considered as a whole, is divisible into four regions : a superior region or vertex ; a lateral region; an inferior region or base ; and an anterior region, the face. The superior region, or vertex of the skull, is bounded ante- riorly by the frontal eminences ; on each side by the temporal ridge and parietal eminence : and behind by the superior curved line of the occipital bone and occipital protuberance. It is crossed trans- versely by the coronal suture, and marked from before backwards by the sagittal, which terminates posteriorly in the lambdoidal suture. Near the posterior extremity of the region, and on each side of the sagittal suture, is the parietal foramen. On the inner or cerebral surface of this region is a shallow groove extending along the middle line from before backwards, for the superior longitudinal sinus : at either side of this groove are several small fossae for the Pacchionian bodies, and further outwards, digital fossae corresponding with the convexities of the convolutions, and numerous ramified grooves for lodging the branches of the arteria meningea media. The lateral region of the skull is divisible into three portions ; temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. The temporal portion, or temporal fossa, is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, in front by the external angular process of the frontal and by the malar bone, and below by the zygoma. It is formed by part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal, squamous portion of the temporal, malar bone,LATERAL REGION OP THE SKULL. 58 and zygoma, and lodges the temporal muscle with the deep temporal arteries and nerves. The mastoid portion is rough, for the attachment of muscles. On its posterior part is the mastoid foramen ; and below, the mas- toid process. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory foramen, surrounded by the external auditory process ; and in front of this foramen the glenoid cavity, bounded above by the middle root of the zygoma, and in front by its tubercle. Fig. 37.* The zygomatic portion, or fossa, is the irregular cavity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior maxillary bone, internally by the external pterygoid plate, above by part of the great wing of the sphenoid, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and temporal fossa ; and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower * Front view of the skull. 1.

It contains the external pterygoid, part of the temporal, and internal pterygoid muscle; and the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve, with their branches. At the inner side and upper part of the zygomatic fossa are two fissures, spheno- maxillary and pterygo-maxillary. The spJieno-maxillary fissure, horizontal in direction, opens into the orbit, and is situated between the great ala of the sphenoid and the superior maxillary bone. It is completed externally by the malar bone. The pterygo-maxillary fissure is vertical, and descends at a right angle from the extremity of the preceding. It is situated between the pterygoid process and the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and transmits the in- ternal maxillary artery. At the angle of junction of these two fissures is a small space, the spheno-maxillary fossa, bounded by the sphenoid, palate, and superior maxillary bone. In this space are seen the openings of five foramina : foramen rotundum, spheno- palatine, pterygo-palatine, posterior palatine, and Vidian. The spheno-maxillary fossa lodges Meckel's ganglion and the termination of the internal maxillary artery. The base op the skull presents an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar surface. The cerebral surface is divisible into three parts, which are named, anterior, middle, and posterior fossa of the base of the cranium. The anterior fossa is somewhat convex at each side, where it corre- sponds with the roof of the orbits ; and concave in the middle, in the situation of the ethmoid bone and anterior part of the body of the sphenoid. The latter and the lesser wings constitute its pos- terior boundary. It supports the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. In the middle line of this fossa, at its anterior part, is the crista galli; immediately in front of that process, the foramen cozcum ; and on each side, the cribriform plate with its foramina, for the transmission of the filaments of the olfactory and nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Farther back in the middle line is the pro- cessus olivaris, and, at the sides of this process, the optic foramina, anterior and middle clinoid processes, and vertical grooves for the internal carotid arteries. The middle fossa of the base, deeper than the preceding, is boun led in front by the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; behind, by the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and is divided into two lateral parts by the sella turcica. It is formed by the posterior part of the body, great ala, and spinous process of the sphenoid, and by the petrous and squamous portion of the temporal bones. In the centre of this fossa is the sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary gland, bounded in front by the anterior and middle, and behind by the dorsum ephippii and posterior clinoid processes. On each side of the sella turcica is the carotid groove for the internal carotid artery, cavernous plexus of nerves, cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves ; and farther outwards the following foramina, from before backwards: sphenoidal fissure (foramen lacerum anterius) for the60 BASE OF THE SKULL. transmission of the third, fourth, three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the sixth nerve, and ophthalmic vein; foramen rotundum, for the superior maxillary nerve ; foramen ovale, for the inferior maxillary nerve, arteria meningea parva, and nervus petrosus superficialis minor ; foramen spinosum, for the arteria meningea media ; foramen lacerum basis cranii, which gives passage to the internal carotid artery, carotid plexus, and petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. On the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone is a groove, leading to a fissured open- ing, the hiatus Fallopii, for the petrosal branch of the Vidian f Cerebral surface of the base of the skull. 1.

Towards the apex of the petrous portion is the notch for the fifth nerve, and below it a slight depression for the Casserian ganglion. Farther outwards is the eminence which marks the position of the perpendicular semicircu- lar canal. Proceeding from the foramen spinosum are two grooves, which indicate the course of the trunks of the arteria meningea media. The whole fossa lodges the middle lobes of the cerebrum. The 'posterior fossa, larger than the other two, is formed by the occipital bone, petrous and mastoid portion of the temporals, and by a small part of the sphenoid and parietals. It is bounded in front by the upper border of the petrous portion and dorsum ephippii, and along its posterior circumference by the groove for the lateral sinuses; it gives support to the pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum. In the centre of this fossa is the foramen magnum, bounded at each side by a rough tubercle, which gives attachment to the odontoid ligament, and by the anterior condyloid foramen. In front of the foramen magnum is the concave surface (clivus Blumenbachii) which supports the medulla oblongata and pons Yarolii, and, on each side, the following foramina, from before backwards. The internal auditory foramen, for the auditory and facial nerve and auditory artery ; behind, and externally to this, is a smq.ll foramen leading into the aquceductus vestibuli ; and below it, partly concealed by the edge of the petrous bone, the aqw&ductus cochlece; next, a long fissure, the foramen lacerum posterius, or jugular foramen, giving passage externally to the commencement of the internal jugular vein, and internally to the eighth pair of nerves. Converging towards this foramen from behind is the deep groove of the lateral sinus, and from the front the groove for the inferior petrosal sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is a longitudinal ridge, which gives attachment to the falx cerebelli, and divides the two inferior fossse of the occipital bone ; and above the ridge is the internal occipital protuberance and the transverse groove lodging the lateral sinus. The external surface of the base of the skull is extremely uneven. From before backwards it is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones; the vomer; pterygoid, spinous processes, and part of the body of the sphenoid ; under surface of the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portion of the temporals ; and by the occipital bone. The palate processes of the superior maxil- lary and palate bones constitute the hard palate, which is raised above the level of the rest of the base, and is surrounded by the alveolar processes containing the teeth of the upper jaw. At the anterior extremity of the hard palate, and directly behind the front incisor teeth, is the anterior palatine or incisive foramen, the ter- mination of the anterior palatine canal, which transmits the naso- palatine nerves. At the posterior angles of the palate are the posterior palatine foramina, for the palatine nerves and arteries.BASE OP THE SKULL. 62 Passing inwards from these foramina is the transverse ridge, to which are attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor palati muscles; and at the middle line of the posterior border, the palate spine, which gives origin to the azygos uvulas. The hard palate is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four processes of which it is composed. Behind, and above the hard palate, are the posterior nares, separated by the "vomer, and bounded at each side by Fig. 39 * * External or basilar surface of the base of the skull. 1,1.

The internal pterygoid plate is long and narrow, terminated at its apex by the hamular process, and at its base by the scaphoid fossa. The external plate is broad; the space between the two is the pterygoid fossa ; it contains part of the internal pterygoid muscle, and the tensor palati. Externally to the external pterygoid plate is the zygomatic fossa. Behind the nasal fossae, in the middle line, is the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and the basilar process of the occipital bone, and still farther back, the foramen magnum. At the base of the external pterygoid plate, on each side, is the foramen ovale, and behind this the foramen spinosum with the prominent spine which gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and laxator tympani muscle. Running outwards from the apex of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, is the fissura Grlaseri, which crosses the glenoid fossa transversely, and divides it into an anterior smooth surface, bounded by the eminentia articularis, for the condyle of the lower jaw, and a posterior rough surface for a part of the parotid gland. Behind the foramen ovale and spinosum, is the irregular fissure between the spinous process of the sphenoid bone and the petrous portion of the temporal, the foramen lacerum anterius basis cranii, which lodges the internal carotid artery and Eustachian tube, and in which the carotid branch of the Vidian nerve joins the carotid plexus. Following the direction of this fissure outwards, we see the foramen for the Eustachian tube, and that for the tensor tympani muscle, separated from each other by the processus cochleariformis. Behind the fissure is the pointed process of the petrous bone which gives origin to the levator palati muscle, and, externally to this process, the carotid foramen for the transmission of the internal carotid artery and ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and behind the carotid foramen, the foramen lacerum posterius basis cranii and jugular fossa. Externally, and somewhat in front of the latter, is the styloid process, and at its base the vaginal process. Behind and at the foot of the styloid process is the stylo-mastoid foramen, for the facial nerve and stylo- mastoid artery, and farther outwards the mastoid process. At the inner side of the root of the mastoid process is the digastric fossa; and a little farther inwards, the occipital groove. On the sides of the foramen magnum, and near its anterior circumference, are the condyles of the occipital bone. In front of each condyle, and piercing its base, is the anterior condyloid foramen for the hypoglossal nerve, and directly behind the condyle the irregular fossa in which the posterior condyloid foramen is situated. Behind the foramen magnum are the two curved lines of the occipital bone, the spine, and the protuberance, with the rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles. The Face is somewhat oval in contour, uneven in surface, and excavated for the reception of two principal organs of sense, the eye64 ORBITS. and the nose. It is formed by part of the frontal bone and by the bones of the face. Superiorly it is bounded by the frontal eminences ; beneath these are the superciliary ridges, converging towards the nasal tuberosity ; beneath the superciliary ridges are the supra- orbital ridges, terminating externally in the external border of the orbit, and internally in the internal border, and presenting towards their inner third the supraorbital notch, for the supraorbital nerve and artery. Beneath the supraorbital ridges are the cavities of the orbits. Between the orbits is the bridge of the nose, over- arching the anterior nares ; and on each side of the nares the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, the infraorbital foramen, and still farther outwards the prominence of the malar bone; at the lower margin of the nares is the nasal spine, and beneath it the superior alveolar arch, containing the teeth of the upper jaw. Forming the lower boundary of the face is the lower jaw, contain- ing in its alveolar process the lower teeth, and projecting inferiorly to constitute the chin ; on either side of the chin is the mental foramen. If a perpendicular line be drawn from the inner third of the supraorbital ridge to the inner third of the body of the lower jaw, it will be found to intersect three openings ; the supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental, each giving passage to a facial branch of the fifth nerve. The orbits are two quadrilateral hollow cones, situated in the upper part of the face, and intended for the reception of the eye- balls, with their muscles, vessels, and nerves, and the lachrymal glands. The central axis of each orbit is directed outwards, so that the axes of the two, continued into the skull through the optic foramina, would intersect over the middle of the sella turcica. The superior boundary of the orbit is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and part of the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; the inferior, by part of the malar bone, superior maxillary, and palate bone ; the internal, by the lachrymal bone, os planum of the ethmoid, and part of the body of the sphenoid ; the external, by the orbital process of the malar bone and great ala of the sphenoid. These may be expressed more clearly in a tabular form :— . ORBITS. Frontal. Sphenoid (lesser wing). Outer wall. Malar. Sphenoid (greater wing). Inner wall. Orbit. Lachrymal. Ethmoid (os planum).

NASAL FOSS.<E. The nasal fossse are two irregular cavities, situated in the middle of the face, and extending from before backwards. They are bounded above by the nasal bones, ethmoid, and sphenoid ; below by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones ; externally by the superior maxillary, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, superior and middle turbinated bones of the ethmoid, palate, and internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid; and the two fossse are separated by the vomer and perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid.

The middle meatus is the space between the middle and inferior turbinated bone ; it also presents three foramina, the open- ing of the frontal sinus, of the anterior ethmoid cells, and of the antrum. The largest of the three passages is the inferior meatus, which is the space between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa ; in it there are two foramina, the termina- tion of the nasal duct, and one opening of the anterior palatine canal.

Man is provided with two successions of teeth : the first are the teeth of childhood ; they are called temporary, deciduous, or milk teeth ; the second continue until old age, and are named, per- manent. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number, sixteen in each jaw ; they are divisible into four classes: incisors, of which there are four in each jaw, two central, and two lateral; canine, two above and two below ; bicuspid, four above and four below ; and molars, six above and six below. The temporary teeth are twenty in number : eight incisors, four canine, and eight molars. The temporary molars have four tubercles, and are succeeded by the permanent bicuspides, which have only two tubercles. Each tooth is divisible into a crown, which is the part apparent above the gum ; a constricted portion around the base of the crown, the neck; and;a root or fang, which is contained within the alve- olus. The root is invested by periosteum, which is a bond of con- nexion between it and the alveolus. The incisor teeth (cutting teeth) are named from presenting a sharp and cutting edge, formed at the expense of the posterior sur- face. The crown is flattened from before backwards, being some- what convex in front and concave behind ; the neck is much con- stricted, and the root compressed from side to side ; at its apex is a small opening for the passage of the nerve and artery of the tooth. The canine teeth (cuspidati) follow the incisors in order from be- fore backwards ; two are , situated in the upper jaw, one at each side, and two in the lower. The crown is larger than that of the incisors, convex before, concave behind, and tapering to a blunted point. The root is longer than that of all the other teeth, com- pressed at each side, and marked by a slight groove. The bicuspid teeth (bicuspidati, small molars), two at each side . in each jaw, follow the canine, and are intermediate in size between them .and the molars.

The teeth of the upper jaw have a greater tendency to the division of their roots than those of the lower, and the posterior than the anterior pair. The molar teeth (multicuspidati, grinders), three at each side in each jaw, are the largest of the permanent set. The crown is quadrilateral, and surmounted by four tubercles; the neck large and round, and the root divided into several fangs. In the npper jaw the first and second molar teeth have three roots, sometimes four, more or less widely separated from each other, two of the roots being external, the other internal. In the lower, there are but two roots, anterior and posterior, flattened from behind for- wards, and grooved so as to mark a tendency to division. The third molars, or dentes sapientise, are smaller than the other two ; they present three tubercles on the surface of the crown ; and the root is single and grooved, appearing to be made up of four or five fangs compressed together, or partially divided. In the lower jaw the fangs are frequently separated to some distance from each other, and curved backwards, so as to offer considerable resistance in the operation of extraction. Structure. —The base of the crown of each tooth is hollowed in its interior into a small cavity which is continuous with a canal passing through the middle of each fang. The cavity and canal, or canals, constitute the cavitas pulpse, and contain a soft cellulo- vascular organ, the pulp, which receives its supply of vessels and nerves through the small opening at the apex of each root. Nasmyth observed, with regard to the pulp, that it is composed of two different tissues, vascular and reticular, the former being an intri- cate web of minute vessels terminating in simple capillary loops ; the latter, a network of nucleated cells in which calcareous salts are gradually deposited, and which by a systematic continuance of that process are gradually converted into ivory. This process takes place at the surface of the pulp, and as the pulp is thus robbed of its cells, new cells are produced by the capillary plexus to supply their place, and be in their turn similarly transformed. A tooth is composed of three distinct structures, ivory or tooth- bone, enamel, and a cortical substance or cementum. When viewed with the microscope, the ivory appears to consist of very minute, tapering, and branching fibres, imbedded in a dense, homogeneous interfibrous substance. The fibres commence by their larger ends in the wall of the cavitas pulpse, and pursue a radiating and ser- pentine course towards the periphery of the tooth, where they ter- minate in ramifications of extreme minuteness. These fibres, for- merly considered as hollow tubuli, are shown by Nasmyth to be rows of minute opake bodies, arranged in a linear series (baccated fibres), to be, in fact, the nuclei of the ivory cells, the interfibrous substance being the rest of the cell filled with calcareous matter. In the natural state of the tooth all trace of the parietes or modeDEVELOPMENT OF TEETH. ally thinner as it approaches the neck. It is 69 Fig. 41 * of connexion of the cells is lost, but after steeping in weak acid, the cellular network is made evident. The enamel forms a crust over the whole exposed surface of the crown of the tooth to the commencement of its root; it is thickest on the summit of the tooth, and becomes gradu- composed of minute hexagonal crystalline fibres, resting by one extremity against the surface of the ivory, and constituting by the other the free surface of the crown. The fibres, examined on the face of a longitudinal section, have a waving arrangement, and consist, like those of ivory, of cells connected by their surfaces and ends, and filled with calcareous substance. When the latter is removed by weak acid, the enamel presents a delicate cellular network of animal tissue. The cortical substance, or cementum (substantia ostoidea) forms a thin coating over the root of the tooth, from the termination of the enamel to the opening in the apex of the fang. In structure it is analogous to bone, and is characterized by the presence of Purkinjean cells and tubuli. The cementum increases in thickness with the advance of age, and gives rise to those exostosed appear- ances occasionally seen on the teeth of very old persons, or in those who have taken much mer- cury. In old age the cavitas pulpse is often filled up and obliterated by osseous substance analo- gous to the cementum. Nasmyth has shown that this, like the other structures composing a tooth, is formed of cells having a reticular arrangement. Development.—The development of the teeth in the human subject has been successfully in- vestigated by Groodsir,f whose inquiries com- menced as early as the sixth week after concep- tion, in an embryo, which measured seven lines and a half in length, and weighed fifteen grains. At this early period each upper jaw presents two semicircular folds around its circumference ; the most external is the true lip ; the internal, the rudiment of the palate ; and between these is a deep groove, lined by the common mucous membrane of the mouth. A little later a ridge is developed from the floor of this groove in a direction from * Magnified section of a canine tooth, showing intimate structure. 1. Crown. 2, 2. Neck. 3. Fang. 4.

At the seventh week the germ of the first deciduous molar of the upper jaw has made its appearance, in the form of a '' simple, free, granular papilla" of the mucous membrane, FigAI* projecting from the floor of the pri- mitive dental groove ; at the eighth week, the papilla of the canine tooth is developed ; at the ninth, week, the papillae of the four incisors (the middle preceding the lateral) appear ; and at the tenth week, the papilla of the second molar is seen behind the anterior molar in the primitive dental groove. So that at this early period, the tenth week, the papillae or germs of the whole ten deciduous teeth of the upper jaw are quite distinct. Those of the lower jaw are a little more tardy ; the papilla of the first molar is merely a slight bulging at the seventh week, and the tenth papilla is not apparent until the eleventh week. From about the eighth week the primitive dental groove becomes contracted before and behind the first deciduous molar, and laminae of the mucous membrane are developed around W' ' the other papillae; the laminae increase in growth, and enclose the papillae in follicles with' open mouths. At the tenth week the follicle of the first molar is completed, then that of the canine ; during the eleventh and twelfth weeks the follicles of the incisors succeed, and at the thirteenth week the follicle of the posterior deciduous molar. During the thirteenth week the papillae undergo an alteration of form, and assume the shape of the teeth they are intended to repre- sent. And at the same time small membranous processes are de- veloped from the mouths of the follicles ; these processes are intended to serve the purpose of opercula to the follicles, and they correspond in shape with the form of the crowns of the appertaining * Figs. 42 to 45, after Goodsir, illustrate the development of the teeth. a, a.

To the follicles of the incisor teeth there are two opercula ; to the canine, three ; and to the molars, a number relative to the number of their tubercles, either four or five. During the fourteenth and fifteenth weeks the opercula have completely closed the follicles, so as to convert them into dental sacs, aud at the same time the papillae have become pulps. The deep portion of the primitive dental groove, viz. that which contains the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being thus closed in, the remaining portion, that which is nearer the surface of the gum, is still left open, and to this Goodsir has given the title of secondary dental groove, as it serves for the development of all the permanent teeth, with the exception of the anterior molars. During the fourteenth and fifteenth weeks small lunated inflections of the mucous membrane are formed, immediately to the inner side of the closing opercula of the deciduous dental follicles, commencing be- hind the incisors and proceeding onwards through the rest; these are the rudiments of the follicles or cavities of reserve of the four permanent incisors, two permanent canines, and four bicuspides. As the secondary dental groove gradually closes, these follicular inflections of the mucous membrane are converted into closed cavities of reserve, which recede from the sur- face of the gum, and lie immediately to the inner side, and in close contact with the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being inclosed in their submucous cellular tissue. At about the fifth month the anterior of these cavities of reserve dilate at their distal extremities, and a fold or papilla projects into their fundus, constituting the rudiment of the germ of the permanent tooth ; at the same time two small opercular folds are produced at their proxi- mal or small extremities, and convert them into true dental sacs. During the fifth month the posterior part of the primitive dental groove behind the sac of the last deciduous tooth has remained open, and in it has developed the papilla and follicle of the first permanent molar. Upon the closure of this follicle by its opercula, the secondary dental groove upon the summit of its crown forms a large cavity of reserve, lying in contact with the dental sac on the one side and with the gum on the superficial side. At this period the deciduous teeth, and the sacs of the ten anterior permanent teeth, increase so much in size, without a corresponding lengthening of the jaws, that the first permanent molars are gradually pressed backwards and upwards into the maxillary tuberosity in the upper jaw, and into the base of the coronoid process of the lower jaw ; a * Saccular stage of dentition, a.

In the infant of seven or eight months, the jaws have grown in length, and the first permanent molar returns to its proper posi- tion in the dental range. The cavity of reserve, which has been previously elongated by the upward movement of the first permanent molar, now dilates into the cavity which that tooth has just quitted; a papilla is developed from its fundus, the cavity becomes con- stricted, and the dental sac of the second molar tooth is formed, still leaving a portion of the great cavity of reserve in connexion with the superficial side of the sac. As the jaws continue to grow in length, the second permanent dental sac descends from its elevated position and advances forwards into the dental range, following the same curve as the first permanent molar. The remainder of the cavity of reserve, already lengthened backwards by the previous position of the second molar, again dilates for the las* time, de- velopes a papilla and sac in the same manner as the preceding, and forms the third permanent molar or wisdom tooth, which, at the age of nineteen or twenty, on the increased growth of the jaw, follows the course of the first and second molars into the dental range. From a consideration of the foregoing phenomena, Goodsir divides the process of dentition into three natural stages : follicular, saccu- lar, and eruptive. The first, or follicular stage, he makes to in- clude all the changes which take place from the first appearance of the dental groove and papillse to the closure of their follicles ; occu- pying a period which extends from the sixth week to the fourth or fifth month of intra-uterine existence. The second, or saccular stage, comprises the period when the follicles are shut sacs, and the included papillse, pulps; it commences at the fourth and fifth months of intra-uterine existence, and terminates, for the median incisors, at the seventh or eighth month of infantine life, and for the wisdom teeth, at about the twenty-first year. The third, or eruptive stage, includes the completion of the teeth, the eruption and shedding of the temporary set, the eruption of the permanent, and the neces- sary changes in the alveolar process. It extends from the seventh month to the twenty-first year. " The anterior permanent molar," says Gfoodsir, " is the most remarkable tooth in man, as it forms a transition between the milk and the permanent set." If considered anatomically, that is, in its development from the primitive dental groove, by a papilla and follicle, "it is decidedly a milk tooth ;" if physiologically, " as the most efficient grinder in the adult mouth, we must consider it a permanent tooth." " It is a curious circumstance, and one which will readily suggest itself to the surgeon, that laying out of view the wisdom teeth, which sometimes decay at an early period from other causes, the anterior molars are the permanent teeth which most frequently give way first, and in the most symmetrical manner, and at the same time, and frequently before the milk set." Growth of Teeth.—Immediately the dental follicles have beenERUPTION OF TEETH. 73 closed by their opercula, the pulps become moulded into the form of the future teeth; and the bases of the molars are divided into two or three portions representing the future fangs. The dental sac is composed of two layers, an internal or vascular layer, originally a part of the mucous surface of the mouth; and a cellulo-fibrous' layer, analogous to the corium of the mucous membrane. Oh^the formation of this sac by the closure of the follicle, the mucou&mem-A: brane resembles a serous membrane in being a shut sac, and May be considered as consisting of a tunica propria, which invests the pulp ; and a tunica reflexa, which is adherent by its outer surface to the structures composing the jaw, and by the inner surface- is free, being separated from the pulp by an intervening space. As soon as the moulding of the pulp has commenced, this space in- creases and becomes filled with a gelatinous granular substance, th enamel organ, which is adherent to the whole internal surface o the tunica reflexa, but not to the tunica propria and pulp. At the same period, viz., during the fourth or fifth month, a thin lamina of ivory is formed in the pulp, and occupies its most prominent point; if the tooth be incisor or canine, the newly-formed layer has the figure of a small hollow cone ; if molar, there will be four or five small cones corresponding with the number of tubercles on its crown. These cones are united by the formation of additional layers, the pulp becomes gradually surrounded and diminishes in size, evolving fresh layers during its retreat into the jaw, until the en- tire tooth with its fangs is completed, and the small cavitas pulpse of the perfect tooth alone remains, communicating through the opening in the apex of each fang with the dental vessels and nerves. The number of roots of a tooth appears to depend on the number of nervous filaments sent to each pulp. "When the formation of the ivory has commenced, the enamel organ becomes transformed into a laminated tissue, corresponding with the direction of the fibres of the enamel, and the crystalline substance of the enamel is secreted into its meshes by the vascular lining of the sac. The cementum appears to be formed at a later period of life, either by the production of osseous substance by that portion of the dental sac which continues to enclose the fang, and acts as its peri- osteum, or by the conversion of that membrane itself into bone ; the former supposition is the more probable. The formation of ivory commences in the first permanent molar previously to birth. Eruption.—When the crown of the tooth has been formed and coated with enamel, and the fang has grown to the bottom of its socket by the progressive lengthening of the pulp, the formation of ivory, and the adhesion of the ivory to the contiguous portion of the sac, the pressure of the socket causes the reflected portion of the sac and the edge of the tooth to approach, and the latter to pass through the gum. The sac has thereby resumed* its original * Nasmyth is of opinion that it is " by a process of absorption, and not of disruption, that the tooth is emancipated."—Medico-Chir. Trans., 1839.74 ERUPTION OF TEETH. Fig. 45.* follicular condition, and has become con- tinuous with the mucous membrane of the mouth. The opened sac now begins to shorten more rapidly than the fang lengthens, and the tooth is quickly drawn upwards by the contraction, leaving a space between the ex- tremity of the unfinished root and the bottom of the socket, in which the growth and com- pletion of the fang are effected. During the changes above described as taking place among the dental sacs contained within the jaws, the septa between the sacs, at first consisting of spongy tissue, gradually became fibrous, and subsequently osseous, the bone being developed from the surface and proceeding by degrees more deeply into the jaws, to constitute the alveoli. The sacs of the ten anterior permanent teeth, at first enclosed in the submucous cellular tissue of the deciduous dental sacs, and received during growth into crypts situated behind the deciduous teeth, advanced by degrees beneath the fangs of those teeth, and became separated from them by distinct osseous alveoli. The necks of the sacs of the permanent teeth, by which they originally communicated with the mucous lining of the secondary groove, still exist, in the form of cords, separated from the deciduous teeth by their alveolus, but communicating through minute osseous canals with the mucous membrane of the mouth, immediately behind the corresponding deciduous teeth. "These cords and foramina are not obliterated in the child," says Gooclsir, "either because the cords are to become useful as 1 gubernacula' and the canals as ' itinera dentiumi or, much more probably, in virtue of a law, which appears to be a general one in the development of animal bodies, viz., that parts, or organs, which have once acted an im- portant part, however atrophied they may afterwards become, yet never altogether disappear, so long as they do not interfere with other parts or functions." Succession.—The periods of appearance of the teeth are extremely irregular ; it is necessary, therefore, to have recourse to an average, which, for the temporary teeth, may be stated as follows, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding those of the upper by a short interval:— 7th month, two middle incisors. 18th month, canine. 9th month, two lateral incisors. 24th month, two last molares. 12th month, first molares. * Eruptive stage of dentition, a.

OS HTOIDES. The os hyoides forms the second arch developed from the cranium, gives support to the tongue, and attachment to numerous muscles in the neck. It is named from its resemblance to the Greek letter v, and consists of a central portion or body, of two larger cornua, which project backwards from the body ; and two lesser cornua, which ascend from the angle of union between the body and the greater cornua. The body is somewhat quadrilateral, rough and convex on its an- tero-superior surface, by which it gives attachment to muscles; con- cave and smooth on the postero-in- ferior surface, by which it lies in contact with the thyro-hyoidean membrane. The greater cornua are flattened from above downwards, and terminated posteriorly by a ■tubercle; and the lesser cornua, conical in form, give attachment to the stylo-hyoid ligaments. In early age and in the adult, the cornua are connected with the body by cartilaginous surfaces and ligamen- tous fibres ; in old age they become united by bone. Development.—By five centres, one for the body, and one for each cornu. Ossification commences in the greater cornua during the last month of foetal life, and in the lesser cornua and body soon after birth. Attachment of Muscles.—To eleven pairs: sterno-hyoid, thyro- hyoid, omo-hyoid, pulley of the digastricus, stylo-hyoid, mylo- hyoid, genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, lingualis, and middle constrictor of the pharynx. It also gives attachment to the stylo-hyoid, thyro-hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments, and to the thyro-hyoidean membrane. THORAX AND UPPER EXTREMITY. The bones of the thorax are the sternum and ribs ; and those of the upper extremity, the clavicle, scapula, humerus, ulna and radius, bones of the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. * The os hyoides seen from before. 1.

The cornua were ossified to the body of the bone in the specimen from which this figure was drawn.STERNUM. 76 Sternum.—The sternum (fig. 47) is situated in the middle line of the front of the chest, and is oblique in direction, the superior end lying within a few inches of the vertebral column, the inferior being projected forwards so as to be placed at a considerable dis- tance from the spine. The bone is flat or slightly concave in front, and marked by five transverse lines which indicate its original subdivision into six pieces. It is convex behind, broad and thick above, flattened and pointed below, and divisible in the adult into three pieces, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior piece or manubrium is nearly quadrilateral ; it is broad and thick above, where it presents a concave border, incisura semilunaris ; and narrow at its junction with the middle piece.- At each superior angle is a deep articular depression, incisura clavicu- laris, for the clavicle; and on either side two notches, for articula- tion with the cartilage of the first rib, and one half that of the second. The articulation of the manubrium with the body is often moveable, often anchylosed ; when the latter state exists, the line of union is marked by a transverse ridge. The middle piece or body, considerably longer than the superior, is broad in the middle, and somewhat narrower at each extremity; It presents at either side six articular notches, for the lower half of the second rib, the four next ribs, and the upper half of the seventh. This piece is sometimes perforated by an opening of various magni- tude, resulting from arrest of development. The inferior piece (ensiform or xiphoid cartilage) is the smallest of the three, often merely cartilaginous, and very various in appear- ance, being sometimes pointed, at other times broad and thin, and at other times, again, perforated by a round hole, or bifid. It pre- sents a notch at each side for articulation with the lower half of the cartilage of the seventh rib. Development. —By a variable number of centres, generally ten, namely, two for the manubrium ; one (sometimes two) for the first piece of the body, two for each of the remaining pieces, and one for the ensiform cartilage. Ossification commences towards the end of the fifth month in the manubrium, the two pieces for this part being placed one above the other. At about the same time the centres for the first and second pieces of the body are apparent; the centres for the third piece of the body appear a few months later, and those for the fourth piece soon after birth. The osseous centre for the ensiform cartilage is so variable in its advent, that it may exist at any period between the third and eighteenth year. The double centres for the body of the sternum are disposed side by side in pairs, and it is the irregular union of these pairs in the last three pieces of the body that gives rise to the large aperture occa- sionally seen in the sternum towards its lower part. Union of the pieces of the sternum commences from below and proceeds upwards; the fourth and the third unite at about puberty, the third and the second between twenty and twenty-five, the second and the first77 STERNUM. between twenty-five and thirty. The ensiform appendix becomes joined to the body of the sternum at forty or fifty years ; and the manubrium to the body only in very old age. Two small pisiform pieces have been described by Beclard and Breschet, as being situated upon and somewhat behind each extremity of the incisura semilunaris of the upper border of the manubrium. These pre-sternal or supra-sternal pieces, by no means constant, appear at about the thirty-fifth year. Beclard considers them as the analogue of the fourchette of birds, and Breschet as the sternal ends of a pair of cervical ribs. Articulations.—With sixteen bones : viz., the clavicles and seven true ribs at each side; the latter by means of the costal cartilages. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine pairs and one single muscle : viz., pectoralis major, sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, * Anterior view of the thorax. 1. Superior piece of the sternum. 2.

Eibs.—The libs are twelve in number at each side : the first seven are connected with the sternum, and are thence named sternal or true ribs; the remaining five are the asternal or false ribs ; and the last two, shorter than the rest, and free at their extremities, are ike floating ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the eighth, whence they diminish to the twelfth ; in breadth they diminish gradually from the first to the last, and, with the excep- tion of the last two, are broader at the anterior than at the pos- terior end. The first rib is horizontal in direction ; all the rest are oblique, the anterior extremity falling considerably below the pos- terior. Each rib presents an external and internal surface, a supe- rior and inferior border, and two extremities ; it is curved to correspond with the arch of the thorax, and twisted, so that, when laid on a horizontal surface, one end is tilted up. The external surface is convex, and marked by the attachment of muscles; the internal is flat, and corresponds with the pleura ; the superior border is rounded ; the inferior sharp and grooved on its inner edge, for the attachment of the intercostal muscles.* Near its vertebral extremity, the rib is somewhat bent; and oppo- site the bend, on the external surface, is a rough oblique ridge, which gives attachment to a tendon of the sacrodumbalis muscle, and is called the angle. The distance between the vertebral extre- Fig. 48 .f niity and the angle increases gradually from the second to the eleventh rib. Beyond the angle is a rough elevation, the tubercle ; and immediately at the base and under side of the tubercle a smooth surface for articulation with the extremity of the transverse process * This groove is commonly described as supporting the intercostal artery, vein, and nerve; which is not the case. t Vertebral extremity of the seventh rib of the right side. 1.

The vertebral end of the rib is some- what expanded, and termed the head, and that portion between the head and the tubercle, the neck. On the extremity of the head is an oval smooth surface divided by a transverse ridge into two facets for articulation with two contiguous vertebra?. The posterior sur- face of the neck is rough, for the attachment of the middle costo- transverse ligament; and upon its upper border is a crest, which gives attachment to the anterior costo-transverse ligament. The sternal extremity is flattened, and presents an oval depression, for the reception of the costal cartilage. The ribs that demand especial consideration are the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first is the shortest rib ; it is broad and flat, and placed horizontally at the upper part of the' thorax, the surfaces looking upwards and downwards, in place of forwards and backwards as in the other ribs. At about the anterior third of the upper surface of the bone, and near its internal border, is a tubercle which gives attachment to the scalenus anticus muscle, and immediately before and behind that tubercle, a shallow oblique groove, the former for the subclavian vein, the latter for the subclavian artery. Near the posterior extremity of the bone is a thick and prominent tubercle, with a smooth articular surface for the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra. There is no angle. Beyond the tubercle is a narrow constricted neck ; and at the extremity, a head, presenting a single articular surface. The second rib, in some of its characters, resembles the first. The tenth rib has a single articular surface on its head. The eleventh and twelfth have each a single articular surface on the head, no neck or tubercle, and are pointed at the free extremity. The eleventh has a slight ridge, representing the angle, and a shallow groove on the lower border; the twelfth has neither. Costal Cartilages.—The costal cartilages serve to prolong the ribs forward to the anterior part of the chest, and contribute mainly to the elasticity of the thorax. They are broad at their attachment with the ribs, and taper slightly towards the sternal end ; they diminish gradually in breadth from the first to the last ; in length they increase from the first to the seventh, and then decrease to the last. The cartilages of the first two ribs are horizontal in direction, the rest incline more and more upwards. In advanced age the costal cartilages are converted more or less completely into bone, the change taking place earlier in the male than in the female. The first seven cartilages articulate with the sternum ; the three next, with the lower border of the cartilage immediately preceding ; the last two lie free between the abdominal muscles. All the car- tilages of the false ribs terminate by pointed extremities. Development.—The ribs are developed by three centres ; one for80 CLAVICLE. / the central part, one for the head, and one for the tubercle. The last two have no centre for the tubercle. Ossification commences in the body somewhat before its appearance in the vertebrae ; the epiphysal centres for the head and tubercle appear between sixteen and twenty, and are consolidated with the rest of the bone at twenty-five. Articulations.—Each rib articulates with two vertebras and one costal cartilage, with the exception of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, which articulate each with a single vertebra only. Attachment of Muscles.—To. the ribs and their cartilages are attached twenty-three pairs, and one single muscle. To the carti- lages, the subclavius, sterno-thyroid, pectoralis major, internal oblique, rectus, transversalis, diaphragm, triangularis sterni, inter- nal and external intercostals. To the ribs, intercostal muscles, scalenus anticus, medius, and posticus, pectoralis minor, serratus magnus, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, latissimus dorsi, qua- dratus lumborum, serratus posticus superior, serratus posticus in- ferior, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, cervicalis ascend ens, leva- tores costarum, transversalis, and diaphragm. Clavicle.—The clavicle is a long bone, shaped like the italic letter/, and extended across the upper part of the side of the chest from the upper piece of the sternum to the point of the shoulder, where it articulates with the scapula. In position it is slightly oblique, the sternal end being somewhat lower and more anterior than the scapular, and the curves are so disposed that at the sternal end the convexity, and at the scapular the concavity, is directed forwards. The sternal half of the bone is rounded or irregularly quadrilateral, and terminates in a broad articular surface. The scapular half is flattened from above downwards, and broad at its extremity, the articular surface occupying only part of its extent, The upper surface is smooth, convex, and partly subcutaneous ; the under surface rough and depressed, for the insertion of the subclavius muscle. At the sternal extremity of the under surface Fig. 49.* * Clavicle of the right ride; its upper and anterior face. 1. The sternal end. 2. The portion which articulates with the first rib. 3, 3.

Development.—By, tv)0 centres ; one for the shaft and one for the sternal extremity; the former appearing before any other bone of the skeleton, the latter between fifteen and eighteen. Articulations.—With the sternum and scapula. Attachment of Muscles.—To six: sterno-cleido-mastoid, trape- zius, pectoralis major, deltoid, subclavius, and sterno-hyoid. Scapula.—The scapula is a flat triangular bone, situated on the posterior aspect and side of the thorax, and occupying the space from the second to the seventh rib. It is divisible into an anterior and posterior surface ; superior, inferior, and posterior border; an- terior, superior, and inferior angle ; and processes. The anterior surface, or subscapular fossa, is concave and uneven, and marked by several oblique ridges which have a direction up- wards and outwards. The whole concavity is occupied by the sub- scapularis muscle, with the exception of a small triangular portion near the superior angle. The posterior surface, or dorsum, is convex, and unequally divided into two portions by the spine ; that portipn above the spine is the supra-spinous fossa ; and that below, the infra-spinous fossa. f The superior border is the shortest of the three ; it is thin and concave, terminated at one extremity by the superior angle, and at the other by the coracoid process. At its humeral end, and formed partly by the base of the coracoid process, is the supra-scapular notch, for the transmission of the supra-scapular nerve. The inferior or axillary border is thick, and marked by several grooves and depressions ; it terminates superiorly at the glenoid cavity, and inferiorly at the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough ridge, which gives origin to the long head of the triceps muscle. On the posterior surface of this border is a depression for the teres minor ; and on its anterior surface a deeper groove for the teres major; near the inferior angle is a pro- jecting lip, which increases the surface of origin of the latter muscle. The posterior border or basegihe longest of the three, is turned towards the vertebral cokynn. It is intermediate in thickness between the superior and inferior, and convex. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms the head of the scapula ; it is immediately surrounded by a constricted portion, the neck. The head presents a shallow pyriform articular surface, the glenoid cavity, having the pointed extremity upwards ; and at its apex is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the long tendon of the biceps. The superior angle is thin and pointed. The inferior angle is thick, and smooth upon the i GtSCAPULA. 82 external surface for the origin of the teres major and for a large bursa over which the mination of the line of attachment of the tendon of the trapezius. The upper border of the spine is rough and subcutaneous, and gives attachment, by two projecting lips, to the trapezius above and deltoid below ; the surfaces of the spine enter into the formation of the supra- and infra-spinous fossa. The nutritious foramina of the scapula are situated in the base of the spine. The acromion, somewhat triangular in form, is flattened, from above downwards; it overhangs the glenoid cavity, the upper surface being rough and subcutaneous, the lower smooth and corresponding with the shoulder-joint. Near its extremity, on the anterior border, is an oval articular surface, for the end of the clavicle. The coracoid process is a thick, round, and curved process of bone, arising from the upper part of the neck of the scapula, and over-arching the glenoid cavity. It is about two inches in * Anterior surface or venter of the scapula. 1,1. Oblique ridges crossing the subscapular fossa. 2, 2. Surface unoccupied by tbe subscapulars muscle. 3. Superior border. 4.

The superior extremity presents a rounded head ; a constriction immediately around the base of the head, the neck; a greater and a lesser tuberosity. The greater tuberosity is situated most externally, and is separated from the lesser by a vertical furrow, the bicipital groove, which lodges the long tendon of the biceps. The edges of this groove below the head of the bone are prominent and rough, and called the anterior and posterior bicipital ridge; the former serves for the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle, the latter for the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The constriction of the bone below the tube- rosities is the surgical neck, and is so named, in contradistinction to the true neck, from being the seat of the accident called by surgi- cal writers fracture of the neck of the humerus. The shaft of the bone is prismoid at its upper part, and flattened from before backwards be- low. On the outer side, at about its middle, is a rough triangular eminence, which gives inser- tion to the deltoid ; and immediately on each side of this eminence is a smooth depression, J* corresponding with the two heads of the brachialis anticus. On the inner side of the middle of the shaft is a ridge, for the attach- ment of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; and behind, an oblique and shallow groove, which lodges the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The foramen for the medullary vessels is situated on the inner surface of the shaft of the bone a little below the coraco-brachial ridge; it is directed downwards. The lower extremity is flattened from before backwards, and terminated inferiorly by a long articular surface, divided into two parts by an elevated ridge. The external portion of the articular surface is a rounded protuberance, eminentia capitata, which articulates with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius; the internal portion is a concave and pulley-like surface, trochlea, for articulation with the ulna.

Im- | mediately in front of the trochlea is a small de- pression for receiving the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the fore-arm ; and imme- diately behind it a large and deep fossa, for con- taining the olecranon process during extension. Development.—By seven centres : one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the tuberosities, one .for the eminentia capitata, one for the trochlea, and one for each condyle, the internal preceding the external. Ossification commences in the diaphysis of the humerus soon after the clavicle ; in the head and tuberosities, during the second and third year of infantile life; in the eminentia capitata and trochlea during the third and sixth year; and in the condyles during the twelfth and fifteenth. The entire bone is con- solidated at twenty. , Articulations.—With the glenoid cavity of ' the scapula, the ulna, and radius. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-four: by the greater tuberosity, supra-spinatus, infra- spinatus, and teres minor; lesser tuberosity, subscapularis ; anterior bicipital ridge, pectoralis major; posterior bicipital ridge and groove, teres major and latissimus dorsi; shaft, external and internal head of the triceps, deltoid, coraco- brachialis, and brachialis anticus ; external con- dyloid ridge and condyle (condylus extensorius), extensors and supinators of the fore-arm, viz., supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and supinator brevis; internal condyle (condylus flexorius), flexors and one pronator, viz., pi'onator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulna. ■—The ulna is a long bone, divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity is large, and forms principally the articulation of the elbow ; the lower extremity is small, and is excluded from the wrist-joint by an interarticular fibrocartilage. * Humerus of the right arm, its posterior aspect. 1.

Fossa for the reception of the olecranon.ULNA. 86 _ The superior extremity presents a semilunar concavity of large size, the greater sigmoid notch, for articulation with the humerus ; and on the outer side a lesser sigmoid notch, for the head of the radius. Bounding the greater sigmoid notch posteriorly is the olecranon process; and, overhanging it in front, a pointed eminence with a rough triangular base, the coronoid process. Behind the lesser sigmoid notch, and extending downwards on the side of the olecranon, is a triangular uneven surface, for the anconeus muscle; and on the posterior surface of the olecranon a smooth triangular surface, which is subcutaneous. The shaft is prismoid in form, and presents three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and in- ternal ; and three borders. The anterior surface is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum for the upper three-fourths of its extent; and below, by a depression for the pronator quadratus muscle. A little above its middle is the nutritious foramen, directed upwards. On the posterior surface, at the upper part of the bone, is the triangular un- even depression for the anconeus muscle, bounded inferiorly by an oblique ridge which runs downwards from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid notch. Below the ridge, the surface is marked into several grooves, for the attachment of the extensor ossis meta- carpi, extensor secundi internodii, and ex- tensor indicis muscle. The internal surface is covered in for the greater part of its extent by the flexor profundus digitorum. The anterior border is rounded, and gives origin by its lower fourth to the pronator quadratus. The posterior is prominent, and affords attach- ment to the flexor carpi ulnaris and extensor carpi ulnaris; expanding at its upper ex- tremity into the triangular subcutaneous surface of the olecranon. The external or radial border is sharp and prominent, for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The lower extremity terminates in a small rounded head, capi- * The two bones of the fore-arm seen from the front. 1. Shaft of the ulna. 2. Greater sigmoid notch. 3.

The latter presents a deep notch at its base for the attachment of the apex of the triangular interarticular cartilage, and by its point gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament. On the posterior surface of the head is a groove, for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris; and on the side opposite the styloid process a smooth surface, for articulation with the side of the radius. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, one for the inferior extremity, and one for the olecranon. Ossification com- mences in the ulna shortly after the humerus and radius ; the ends Fig. 55. of the bone are cartilaginous at birth. The centre for the lower end appears at about the fifth ; that for the olecranon about the seventh year. The bone is completed at about the twentieth year. Articulations.—With two bones ; humerus and radius; it is separated from the cunei- form bone of the carpus by the triangular in- terarticular cartilage. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve: by the olecranon to the triceps extensor cubiti, one head of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and an- coneus ; by the coronoid process, brachialis anticus, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor profundus digitorum ; by the shaft, flexor profundus digitorum, flexor \ mm mi carpi ulnaris, pronator quadratus, anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor ossis meta- carpi pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pol- licis, and extensor indicis. Eadius.—The radius is the rotatory bone of the fore-arm ; it is divisible into a shaft and two extremities; unlike the ulna, its upper extremity is small, and merely acces- sory to the formation of the elbow-joint; while the lower extremity is large, and forms almost solely the joint of the wrist. The superior extremity presents a rounded head, depressed on its upper surface into a shallow cup. Around the margin of the head is a smooth articular surface which is broad on the inner side, where it articulates with * Bones of the fore-arm, seen on their posterior aspect. 1.

Beneath the head is a constricted circular neck ; and beneath the neck, on its internal aspect, a prominent process, the tuberosity. The"surface of the tube- rosity is partly smooth and partly rough ; rough below, where it receives the attachment of the tendon of the biceps; and smooth above, where a bursa is interposed between the tendon and the bone. The shaft of the bone is prismoid, and presents three surfaces. The anterior surface is somewhat concave superiorly, where it lodges the flexor longus pollicis ; and flat below, where it supports the pronator quadratus. At about the upper third of this surface is the nutritious foramen, which is directed upwards. The posterior surface is round above, where it supports the supinator brevis muscle, and marked below by several shallow oblique grooves, which afford attachment to the extensor muscles of the thumb. The external surface is round and convex, and marked by an oblique ridge, which extends from the tuberosity to the styloid process at the lower extremity of the bone. On the inner margin is a sharp and prominent crest, which gives attachment to the inter- osseous membrane. The loiver extremity of the radius is broad and triangular, and provided with two articular surfaces ; one at the side of the bone, which is concave to receive the rounded head of the ulna; the other at the extremity, and marked by a slight ridge into two facets, one external and triangular, corresponding with the scaphoid ; the other square, with the semilunar bone. At the outer side of the extre- mity is a strong conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of the supinator longus, and by its apex to the external lateral ligament of the wrist joint. The inner edge of the articular surface affords attachment to the base of the triangular interarticular fibrocartilage of the ulna. Immediately in front of the styloid process is a groove, which lodges the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii; and, behind the process, a broader groove, for the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and extensor secundi internodii; behind this is a prominent ridge, and a deep and narrow groove, for the tendon of the extensor indicis ; and farther back, part of a broad groove, completed by the ulna, for the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum. Development.—By three centres ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after the humerus, and before the ulna. The inferior centre appears during the second year, the superior about the seventh. The bone is per- fected at twenty. Articulations.—With four bones ; humerus, ulna, scaphoid, and semilunar. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine: by the tuberosity to theCARPUS. 89 biceps ; by the oblique ridge, supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor subliniis digitorum, and pronator quadratus ; by the anterior surface, flexor longus pollicis and pronator quadratus; by the pos- terior surface, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii; and by the styloid process, supinator longus. Carpus.—The bones of the carpus are eight in number; and arranged in two rows. In the first row, commencing from the radial side, are the os scaphoides, semilunare, cuneiforme, pisi- forme ; in the second row, in the same order, os trapezium, trape- zoides, os magnum, and unciforme. The scaphoid bone is named from bearing some resemblance to the shape of a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite, concave on one side, and convex on the other. It is, however, more similar in form to a cashew nut flattened and concave on one side. If carefully examined, it will be found to pre- sent a convex and a concave surface, a convex and a concave border, a broad end, and a narrow and pointed extremity, the tuberosity. To ascertain to which hand the bone belongs, let the student hold it horizontally, the convex surface looking backwards (i.e., towards himself), and the convex border upwards : the broad extremity will indicate its appropriate hand ; if it be directed to the right, the bone belongs to the right; if to the left, to the left carpus. Articulations.—With five bones ; by its convex surface with the radius; by its concave surface, with the os magnum and semilu- nare ; by the extremity of its upper or dorsal border, with the trapezium and trapezoides. Attachments.—By its tuberosity to the anterior annular ligament. The semilunar bone may be known by having a crescentic con- cavity, and a somewhat crescentic figure. It presents for examina- tion four articular surfaces and two extremities ; the articular surfaces are, one concave, one convex, and two lateral, one late- ral surface being crescentic, the other nearly circular and divided generally into two facets. The extremities are, one dorsal, which is quadrilateral, flat, and indented for the attachment of ligaments ; the other palmar, which is convex, rounded, and of larger size. To determine to which hand it belongs, let the bone be held per- pendicularly, the dorsal or flat extremity looking upwards, and the convex side backwards (towards the holder). The circular lateral surface will point to the side corresponding with the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With five bones, but occasionally with only four; by its convex surface, with the radius ; by its concave surface, with the os magnum ; by its crescentic lateral facet, with the scaphoid ; by the circular surface, with the cuneiform bone and the point of the unciform. This surface is divided into two parts by a ridge, when it articulates with the unciform as well as with the cuneiform bone.CUNEIFORME.—PISIFORME. 90 The cuneiform bone, although somewhat wedge-shaped in" form, may be best distinguished Fig, 56.* by a circular and isolated facet, which articulates with the pisi- form bone. It presents for exa- mination three surfaces, a base and an apex. One surface is very rough and uneven; the opposite forms a concave articular surface ; the third is partly rough and partly smooth, and presents that circular facet which is characteris- tic of the bone. The base is an articular surface, and the apex rough and pointed. To distinguish its appropriate hand, let the base be directed backwards, and the pisiform facet upwards ; the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations. — With three bones, and the triangular fibrocartilage. By the base, with the semilunare ; by the concave surface, with the unciforme; by the circular facet, with the pisiforme; and by the superior angle of the rough surface, with the fibrocartilage. The pisiform bone may be recognised by its small size, and by the possession of only one articular facet. Examined carefully, it will be observed to present four sides and two extremities ; one side is articular, the smooth facet approaching nearer the superior than the inferior extremity. The side opposite to this is rounded ; the remaining sides are, one slightly concave, the other slightly convex. If the bone be held so that the articular facet shall look down- wards, and the extremity which overhangs the articular facet for- wards, the concave side will point to the hand to which it belongs. Articulations.-—With the cuneiform bone only. Attachments.—To two muscles, flexor carpi ulnaris, and abductor minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament. * Diagram showing the dorsal surface of the bones of the carpus, with their articulations.—The right hand.

It is somewhat compressed, and may be divided into two surfaces which are smooth and articular, and three rough borders. One of the articular surfaces is oval, concave in one direction, and convex in the other (saddle-seat shaped) ; the other is marked into three facets. One of the borders presents the groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which is surmounted by a prominent tubercle for the attachment of the anterior annular ligament; the other two borders are rough, and form the outer side of the carpus. The grooved border is narrow at one extremity and broad at the other, where it presents the groove and tubercle. If the bone be held so that the grooved border look upwards while the apex of this border is directed forwards, and the base with the tubercle backwards, the concavo-convex surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.-—With, four bones : by the concavo-convex surface, with the metacarpal bone of the thumb ; and by the three facets of the other articular surface, with the scaphoid, trapezoid, and second metacarpal bone. * Bones of the carpus of the left hand, separated so as to show the form of the particular bones.

UNCIFORME. 92 Attachments.-—To three muscles, abductor pollicis, flexor ossis metacarpi, and flexor brevis pollicis ; and by the tubercle to the anterior annular ligament. The T.RA.PEZOIDES (os multangulum minus) is a small, oblong, and quadrilateral bone, bent near its middle (bean-shaped). It pre- sents four articular surfaces and two extremities. One of the sur- faces is concavo-convex, i. e., concave in one direction, and convex in the other ; another, contiguous to the preceding, is concave, so as to be almost angular in the middle, and often marked by a small rough depression, for an interosseous ligament ; the two remaining sides are flat. One of the two extremities is broad and of large size, dorsal; the other, palmar, is small and rough. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the broad extremity be upwards, and the concavo-convex surface forwards, the angular concave surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—"With four bones : by the concavo-convex surface, with the second metacarpal bone ; by the angular concave surface, with the os magnum ; and by the other two surfaces, with the tra- pezium and scaphoid. Attachments.—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. The os magnum (capitatum) is the largest bone of the carpus, and divisible into a body and head. The head is round for the greater part of its extent, but flattened at one side. The hody is irregularly quadrilateral, and presents four sides and a smooth extremity. Two of the sides are rough, the one being square and flat, dorsal; the other rounded and prominent, palmar ; the two remaining sides are articular, one being concave, the other convex. The extremity is a triangular articular surface, divided into three facets. If the bone be held perpendicularly, the articular extremity look- ing upwards, and the broad dorsal surface backwards (towards the holder), the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—"With seven bones : by the rounded head, with the cup formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bone ; by the side of the convex surface, with the trapezoides ; by the concave surface, with the unciforme ; and by the exti'emity, with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bone. Attachments.—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. The unciforme is a triangular-shaped bone, remarkable for a long and curved process, which projects from its palmar aspect. It presents five surfaces ; three articular, and two free. One of the articular surfaces is divided by a slight ridge into two facets ; the other two converge, and meet at.a flattened angle.* One of the free surfaces, the dorsal, is rough and triangular; the other, palmar, also triangular, but somewhat smaller, gives origin to the unciform process. * When the unciforme does not articulate with the semilunare, this angle is sharp.METACARPUS. 93 Fig. If the bone be held perpendicularly, the articular surface with two facets looking upwards, and the unciform process backwards (towards the holder), the concavity of the unciform process will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With Jive bones; by the two facets on its base, with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bone; by the two lateral articu- lating surfaces, with the magnum and cuneiforme ; and by the flat- tened angle of its apex, with the semilunare. Attachments.—To two muscles, adductor minimi digiti, and flexor brevis minimi digiti; and by the hook-shaped process to the anterior annular ligament. Development.—The bones of the carpus are each developed by a single centre ; they are cartilagi- nous at birth. Ossification com- mences towards the end of the first year in the os magnum and unciforme ; at the end of the third year, in the cuneiforme; during the fifth year, in the trapezium and semilunare; during the eighth, in the scaphoides ; ninth, in the trapezoides ; and twelfth, in the pisiforme. The latter bone is the last in the skeleton it is, in reality, a sesamoid bone of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The number of articulations which each bone of the carpus main- tains with surrounding bones may be expressed in figures, which will facilitate the student's recollection; the cipher for the first row is 5531, and for the second 4475. Metacarpus.—The bones of the metacarpus are five in number. They are long bones, divisible into a head, shaft, and base. The head is rounded at the extremity, and flattened at each side for the insertion of strong ligaments ; the shaft is prismoid, and marked deeply on each side, for the attachment of the interossei * Left hand viewed on its anterior or palmar aspect. 1.

The base presents three articular surfaces : one at each side, for adjoining metacarpal bones ; and one at the extremity, for the carpus. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is one-third shorter than the rest, flattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and convex on its palmar side; the articular surface of the head is not so round as that of the other metacarpal bones ; and the base has a single con- cavo-convex surface, to articulate with the corresponding surface of the trapezium. The metacarpal bones of the different fingers may be distinguished by certain special characters. The base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger is the largest of the four, and presents four arti- cular surfaces. That of the middle finger may be distinguished by a rounded projecting process at the radial side of its base, and two small circular facets on its ulnar lateral surface. The base of the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger is small and square, and has two small circular facets to correspond with those of the middle meta- carpal. The metacarpal bone of the little finger has only one lateral articular surface. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the epiphysis of which, like that of the phalanges, occupies the carpal end of the bone. Ossification of the metacarpal bones commences in the embryo between the tenth and twelfth week, that is, soon after the bones of the fore-arm. The epiphyses make their appearance at the end of the second, or early in the third year, and the bones are completed at twenty. Articulations.—The first with the trapezium; second, trape- zium, trapezoides, os magnum, and middle metacarpal; third or middle, os magnum, and adjoining metacarpal bones ; fourth, os magnum, unciforme, and adjoining metacarpal bones ; fifth, unci- forme, and metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. The figures representing the number of articulations which each metacarpal bone possesses, taken from the radial to the ulnar side, are 13121. Attachment of Muscles.—To the metacarpal bone of the thumb, three, flexor ossis metacarpi, extensor ossis metacarpi, and first dorsal interosseous ; index finger, five, extensor carpi radialis longior, flexor carpi radialis, first and second dorsal and first palmar inter- osseous ; middle finger, four, extensor carpi radialis brevior, ad- ductor pollicis, second and third dorsal interosseous ; ring-finger, three, third and fourth dorsal interosseous, and second palmar ; little finger, four, extensor carpi ulnaris, adductor minimi digiti, fourth dorsal and third palmar interosseous. Phalanges.—The phalanges (internodia) are the bones of the fingers; they are named from their arrangement in rows, and are95 PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY. fourteen in number, three to each finger, and two to the thumb. In conformation they are long bones, divisible into a shaft, and two extremities. The shaft is compressed from before backwards, convex on its posterior surface, and flat with raised edges in front. The meta- carpal extremity or base in the first row, is a simple concave arti- cular surface ; that in the other two rows a double concavity, sepa- rated by a slight ridge. The digital extremities of the first and second row present a pulley-like surface, concave in the middle, and convex at each side. The ungual extremity of the last phalanx is broad, rough, and expanded into a semilunar crest. Development.—By two centres ; one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences in the third or ungual phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the second. The period of com- mencement corresponds with that of the metacarpal bones. The epiphyses of the first row appear during the third or fourth year, those of the second row during the fourth or fifth, and of the last during the sixth or seventh. The phalanges are perfected by the twentieth year. Articulations.—The first row, with the metacarpal bones and second row of phalanges ; the second row, with the first and third ; the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles,—To the base of the first phalanx of the thumb four muscles, abductor pollicis, flexor brevis pollicis, adduc- tor pollicis, and extensor primi internodii; to the second phalanx, two, flexor longus pollicis, and extensor secundi internodii. To the first phalanx of the second, third, and fourth fingers, one dorsal and one palmar interosseous ; to that of the little finger, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and one palmar interos- seous. To the second phalanges, flexor sublimis and extensor com- munis digitorum ; to the last phalanges, flexor profundus and ex- tensor communis digitorum. PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY. The bones of the pelvis are the two ossa innominata, the sacrum, and the coccyx ; and-those of the lower extremity, the femur, pa- tella, tibia and fibula, tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges. Os innominatum.—The os innominatum (os coxse) is an irregular, flat bone, consisting in the young subject of three parts, which meet at the acetabulum. Hence it is described in the adult as divisible into three portions, ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the superior, broad, and expanded portion which forms the prominence of the hip, and articulates with the sacrum. The ischium is the inferior and strong part of the bone on which the body rests in sitting. The os pubis is that portion which forms the front of the pelvis, and gives support to the external organs of generation.96 ILIUM. The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, below by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by the anterior and posterior border ; it is concave and smooth for the anterior two-thirds of its extent, and lodges the iliacus muscle. The posterior third is rough, for articulation with the sacrum, and divided by a deep groove into two parts ; an anterior or auricular portion, shaped like the pinna, and coated by cartilage in the fresh bone ; and a posterior portion, very rough and uneven, for the at- tachment of interosseous ligaments. .The external surface is uneven, partly convex, and partly con- cave : it is bounded above by the crest; below by a prominent arch, which forms the upper segment of the acetabulum ; and, be- fore and behind, by the anterior and posterior border.

The surface included between the superior curved line and the crest gives origin to the gluteus medius muscle; that between the curved lines, to the gluteus minimus; and the rough interval between the inferior curved line and the arch of the acetabulum, to one head of the rectus. The posterior sixth of the external surface is rough and raised, and gives origin to part of the gluteus maximus. The crest of the ilium is arched, and curved in direction like the italic letter f, being bent inwards at its anterior termination, and outwards at the posterior. It is broad for the attachment of three planes of muscle, which are connected with its external and internal border or lip, and with the intermediate space. On its outer lip, at about midway between the anterior superior spinous process and the summit of the crest, is a prominent tubercle, tuberculum crista ilii (Retzius), from which a strong ridge runs down to the aceta- bulum. This is the broadest part of the crest, and the descending ridge serves as a buttress in giving strength to the bone. The anterior border is marked by two prominences, the anterior superior spinous process, which is the anterior termination of the crest, ;and the anterior inferior spinous process ; the two processes being separated by a notch for the attachment of the sartorius muscle. This border terminates inferiorly in the lip of the aceta- bulum. The posterior border also presents two prominences, the posterior superior and posterior inferior spinous process, separated by a notch. Inferiorly this border is broad, and arched, and forms the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch. The ischium is divisible into a thick and solid portion, the body, and a thin and ascending part, the ramus ; it may be considered also, for convenience of description, as presenting an external and internal surface, and three borders, posterior, inferior, and superior. The external surface is rough and uneven, for the attachment of muscles ; and broad and smooth above, where it enters into the formation of the acetabulum. Below the inferior lip of the aceta- bulum is a notch, which lodges the obturator externus muscle in its passage outwards to the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The internal surface is smooth, and somewhat encroached upon at its posterior border by the spine. The posterior border of the ischium presents towards its middle a remarkable projection, the spine. Immediately above the spine is a notch of large size, the great sacro-ischiatic, and below the spine, the lesser sacro-ischiatic notch ; the former, being converted into a foramen by the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, gives passage to the pyriformis muscle, the gluteal vessels and nerve, pudic vessels and nerve, and ischiadic vessels and nerves; the lesser, completed by H98 OS PUBIS.—ACETABULUM. the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, to the obturator internus muscle, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. The inferior border is thick and broad, and called the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is divided into three facets; one anterior, which is rough for the origin of the semi-membranosus ; and two posterior, which are smooth and separated by a slight ridge, for the semi-tendinosus and biceps muscle. The inner margin of the tuberosity is bounded by a sharp ridge, which gives attachment to a prolongation of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament; and the outer margin by a prominent ridge, from which the quadratus femoris muscle arises. The supe- rior border of the ischium is thin, and forms the lower circum- ference of the obturator foramen. The ramus of the ischium is continuous with the ramus of the pubes, and is slightly everted. The os pubis is divided into a horizontal portion or body (hori- zontal ramus of Albinus), and a descending portion or ramus; it presents for examination an external and internal surface, superior and inferior border, and symphysis. The external surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles ; and prominent at its outer extremity, where it forms part of the acetabulum. The internal surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the cavity of the pelvis. The superior border is marked by a rough ridge, the crest; the inner termination of the crest is the angle ; the outer end, the spine or tubercle. Running outwards from the spine is a sharp ridge, the pectineal line, or linea ilio-pectinea, which marks the brim of the true pelvis. In front of the pectineal line is a smooth depression, which supports the femoral artery and vein, and a little mere externally an elevated prominence, the ilio-pectineal eminence, which divides the surface for the femoral vessels from another depression which overhangs the acetabulum, and lodges the psoas and iliacus muscle. The ilio- pectineal eminence, moreover, marks the junction of the pubes with the ilium. The inferior border is broad, deeply grooved for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve, and sharp on the side of the ramus, to form part of the boundary of the obturator fora- men. The symphysis is the inner extremity of the body of the bone; it is oval and rough, for the attachment of a ligamentous structure analogous to the intervertebral substance. The ramus of the pubes descends obliquely outwards, and is continuous with the ramus of the ischium. The inner border of the ramus forms with the corresponding bone the arch of the pubes, and at its inferior part is everted, to give attachment to the crus penis. The acetabulum (cavitas cotyloidea) is a deep cup-shaped cavity, situated at the point of union between the ilium, ischium, and pubes; a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a liUle more than two-fifths by the ischium, the remaining fifth by the pubes. It is bounded by a deep rim or lip, broad and strong above, where most resistance is required, and marked in front by a deep notch, which is arched over in the fresh subject by a strong99 OBTURATOR FORAMEN. ligament, and transmits the nutrient vessels of the joint. At the bottom of the cup, and communicating with the notch, is a deep circular pit (fundus acetabuli), which lodges a mass of fat, and gives attachment to the broad extremity of the ligamentum teres. The obturator or thyroid foramen is a large oval interval be- tween the ischium and pubes, bounded by a narrow rough margin, to which a ligamentous membrane is attached. The upper part of the foramen is increased in depth by the groove in the under surface of the os pubis, which lodges the obturator vessels and nerve. Development.—By eight centres: three principal, one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the pubes; and five secondary, one, the Y shaped piece for the interval between the primitive pieces in the bottom of the acetabulum, one for the crest of the ilium, one (not constant) for the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ilium, one for the tuberosity of the ischium, and one (not constant) for the angle of the os pubis. Ossification commences in the primitive pieces, immediately after that in the vertebrae, firstly in the ilium, then in the ischium, and lastly in the pubes; the first ossific deposits being situated near the future acetabulum. At birth, the acetabulum, crest of the ilium, and ramus of the pubes and ischium, are cartilaginous. The secondary centres ap- pear at puberty, the entire bone not being completed until the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With three bones ; sacrum, opposite innomi- natum, and femur. Attachment of Muscles and Ligaments.—-To thirty-three muscles : to the ilium thirteen ; by the outer lip of the crest, obliquus ex- ternus for two-thirds its length, latissimus dorsi one-third, and tensor vaginae femoris its anterior fourth ; by the middle of the crest, internal oblique three-fourths its length, erector spinge the remaining fourth; by the internal lip, transversal is three-fourths, and quadratus lumborum the posterior part of its middle third. By the external surface, gluteus medius, minimus, -maximus, and one head of the rectus ; by the internal surface, iliacus ; by the anterior border, sartorius,. and the other head of the rectus. To the ischium fourteen; by its external surface, adductor magnus and obturator externus; by the internal surface, obturator internus and levator ani; by the spine, gemellus superior, levator ani, coc- cygeus, and lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament; by the tuberosity, biceps, semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, erector penis, and great sacro-ischiatic ligament; by the ramus, gracilis, and transversus perinei. To the os pubis sixteen : by its upper border, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, transversalis, rectus, pyramidalis, pectineus, and psoas parvus ; by its external surface, adductor longus, adductor brevis, gracilis, and obturator externus ; by its internal surface, levator ani and obtu- rator internus ; and by the ramus, adductor magnus, erector penis, and accelerator urinae. h 2100 PELVIS. The pelvis, considered as a whole, is divisible into a false and true pelvis ; the former is the expanded portion, bounded on each side by the ilium, and separated from the true pelvis by the linea Fig. 60.* ilio-pectinea. The true pelvis is all that portion which is situated below the linea ilio-pectinea. This line forms the margin or brim of the true pelvis, while the included area is called the inlet. The form of the inlet is heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front at the * Female pelvis. 1. Last lumbar vertebra. 2, 2.

The cavity is somewhat encroached upon at each side by a smooth quadrangular plane of bone, corresponding with the internal surface of the acetabulum, and prolonged poste- riorly into the spine of the ischium. In front are two fossas around the obturator foramina, for lodging the obturator internus muscle at each side. The inferior termination of the pelvis is very irre- gular, and is termed the outlet. It is bounded, in front, by the convergence of the rami of the ischium and pubes, which constitute the arch of the pubes; on each side by the tuberosity of the ischium, and two irregular fissures formed by the greater and lesser sacro- ischiatic notches : and behind by the lateral borders of the sacrum, and the coccyx. The pelvis is placed obliquely with regard to the trunk of the body, the inner surface of the ossa pubis being directed upwards, and serving to support the weight of the abdominal viscera. The base of the sacrum rises nearly four inches above the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx somewhat more than half an inch above its lower border. If a line were carried through the central axis of the inlet, it would impinge by one extremity against the umbilicus, and' by the other against the middle of the coccyx. The axis of the inlet is, therefore, directed downwards and backwards, while that of the outlet points downwards and forwards, and corresponds with a line drawn from the upper part of the sacrum, through the centre of the outlet. The axis of the cavity represents a curve, corresponding very nearly with the curve of the sacrum, the extremities being indicated by the central points of the inlet and outlet. A knowledge of the direction of these axes is important to the surgeon, as indicating the line in which instruments should be used in operations upon the viscera of the pelvis, and the direction of force in the removal of calculi from the bladder; and to the accoucheur, as explaining the course taken by the foetus during parturition. There are certain characteristic differences between the male and female pelvis. In the male the bones are thicker, stronger, and more solid, the cavity being deeper and narrower. In the female the bones are lighter and more delicate, the iliac fossse large, and the ilia expanded ; the inlet, outlet, and cavity are large, and the acetabula farther removed from each other ; the cavity is shallow, the tuberosities widely separated, the obturator foramina triangular, and the span of the pubic arch greater. The precise diameter of the inlet and outlet, and the depth of the cavity of the female pelvis, are important considerations to the accoucheur. The diameters of the inlet or brim are three : 1. Antero-posterior, sacro-pubic or conjugate ; 2. transverse ; and 3. oblique. The antero-posterior extends from the symphysis pubis to the middle of the promontory of the sacrum, and measures four inches. TheFEMUR. 102 transverse extends from the middle of the brim on one side to the same point on the opposite, and measures five inches. The oblique extends from the sacro-iliac symphysis on one side to the margin of the brim corresponding with the acetabulum on the opposite, and also measures five inches. The diameters of the outlet are two, antero-posterior and trans- verse. The antero-posterior diameter extends from the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the apex of the coccyx ; the transverse, from the posterior part of one tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side ; they both measure four inches. The cavity of the pelvis measures in depth four inches and a half, posteriorly ; three inches and a half in the middle ; and one and a half at the sym- physis pubis. Femur.—The femur, the longest bone of the skeleton, is situated obliquely in the upper part of the lower limb, articulating by means of its head with the acetabulum, and inclining inwards as it descends, until it almost meets its fellow of the opposite side at the knee. In the female this obliquity is greater than in the male, in consequence of the greater breadth of the pelvis. The femur is divisible into a shaft, a superior, and an inferior extremity. At the superior extremity is a rounded head directed upwards and inwards, and marked just below its centre by an oval depres- sion for the ligamentum teres. The head is supported by a neck, which varies in length and obliquity with sex and period of life, being long and oblique in the adult male, shorter and more hori- zontal in the female and in old age. Externally to the neck is a large process, the trochanter major, which presents on its anterior surface an oval facet, for the attachment of the tendon of the gluteus minimus muscle; and above, a double facet for the inser- tion of the gluteus medius. On its posterior side is a vertical ridge, linea quadrati, for the attachment of the quadratus femoris muscle. At the inner side of the trochanter major is a deep pit, trochanteric or digital fossa, in which are inserted the tendons of the pyriformis, gemellus superior and inferior, and obturator ex- ternus and internus muscles. Passing downwards from the tro- chanter major in front of the bone is an oblique ridge, which forms the inferior boundary of the neck, the anterior intertrochanteric line ; and behind, another oblique ridge, the posterior intertrochan- teric line, which terminates in a rounded tubercle on the posterior and inner side of the bone, the trochanter minor. The shaft of the femur is convex and round in front, and covered with muscles ; and somewhat concave and raised into a rough and prominent ridge behind, the linea aspera. The linea aspera near the upper extremity of the bone divides into three branches. The anterior branch is continued forwards in front of the lesser tro- chanter, and is continuous with the anterior intertrochanteric line ; the middle is continued directly upwards into the linea quadrati;103 FEMUR. Fig. 61. and the posterior, broad and strongly marked, ascends to the base of the tro- chanter major. Towards the lower ex- tremity of the bone the linea aspera divides into two ridges, which descend to the two condyles, and enclose a triangular space upon which rests the popliteal artery. The internal condyloid ridge is less marked than the external, and presents a broad and shallow groove, for the passage of the femoral artery. The nutritious foramen is situated in or near the linea aspera, at about one-third from its upper extremity, and is directed obliquely from below up- wards. The lower extremity of the femur is broad and porous, and divided by a smooth depression in front, and by a large fossa (fossa intercondyloidea) behind, into two condyles. The external condyle is the broadest and most prominent, the internal the nar- rowest and longest; the difference in length depending on the obliquity of the femur, in consequence of the separation of the two bones at their upper extremity by the breadth of the pelvis. The external con- dyle is marked on its outer side by a pro- minent tuberosity, which gives attachment to the external lateral ligament; and im- mediately beneath this is the fossa which lodges the tendon of origin of the popliteus. By the internal surface it gives attachment to the anterior crucial ligament of the knee-joint; and by its upper and posterior part, to the external head of the gastro- cnemius and plantaris. The internal con- dyle projects on its inner side into a tuberosity, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament; above this tuberosity, at the ex- tremity of the internal condyloid ridge, is a tubercle, for the insertion of the tendon of the adductor magnus ; and below the tubercle, on the upper surface of the condyle, a depression from * The right femur, seen on its anterior aspect. 1.

The outer side of the internal condyle is rough and concave, for the attachment of the posterior crucial ligament. Development.—By Jive centres ; one for the shaft, one for each extremity, and one for each trochanter. The femur is the first of the long bones to show signs of ossifica- tion, ossific matter is found immediately after the maxillse and before the termi- nation of the second month of embryonic life. The secondary deposits take place in the following order : in the condyloid ex- tremityf during the last month of foetal life ; in the head towards the end of the first year; in the greater trochanter be- tween the third and fourth year ; in the lesser trochanter between the thirteenth and fourteenth. The epiphyses and apo- physes are joined to the diaphysis in the reverse order of their appearance, the junc- tion commencing after puberty, and not being completed for the condyloid epiphysis until after the twentieth year. Articulations.—With three bones; os innoininatum, tibia, and patella. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty* three; by the greater trochanter, to the gluteus medius and minimus, pyriformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, obturator externus, and quadratus femoris; by the lesser tro- chanter, to the common tendon of the psoas and iliacus. By the linea aspera, its outer lip, to the vastus externus, gluteus maximus, and short head of the biceps; by its inner lip, vastus internus, pectineus, adductor brevis, and adductor longus ; by its middle, adductor magnus ; by the anterior part of the bone, crurseus and subcrurseus; by its condyles, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteus. * Diagram of the posterior aspect of the right femur, showing the lines of attachment of the" muscles.

It is heart- shaped in figure, the broad end being Fig. 63.* directed upwards, the apex downwards ; the external surface is convex, and the internal divided by a ridge into two smooth surfaces, to articulate with the condyles of the femur. The external articular surface, corresponding with the external condyle, is the larger of the two, and serves to indicate the leg to which the bone belongs. Development.—By a single centre, at about the middle of the third year. Articulations.-—"With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles.—To four; rectus, crurseus, vastus in- ternus, vastus externus ; and to the ligamentum patellae. Tibia.—The tibia is the inner and larger bone of the leg ; it is prismoid in form, and divisible into a shaft, an upper and lower extremity. The upper extremity, or head, is large, and expanded laterally into two tuberosities. On the upper surface the tuberosities are smooth, to articulate with the condyles of the femur ; the internal articular surface being oval and oblong, to correspond with the in- ternal condyle ; the external, broad and nearly circular. Between the two articular surfaces is a spinous process ; and in front of and behind the spinous process a rough depression, giving attachment to the anterior and posterior crucial ligament. Between the two tuberosities on the front aspect of the bone is a prominent elevation, the tubercle for the insertion of the ligamentum patellae, and imme- diately above the tubercle a smooth facet, corresponding with a bursa. Upon the outer side of the external tuberosity is an arti- cular surface, for the head of the fibula ; and upon the posterior part of the internal tuberosity a depression, for the insertion of the tendon of the senii-membranosus muscle. The shaft of the tibia presents three surfaces ; internal, which is subcutaneous and superficial; external, concave and marked by a sharp ridge, for the insertion of the interosseous membrane ; and posterior, grooved, for the attachment of muscles. Near the upper extremity of the posterior surface is an oblique ridge, the popliteal line, for the attachment of the fascia of the popliteus muscle; and immediately below the oblique line, the nutritious canal, which is directed downwards. * Patella of the right side. 1.

The inferior extremity of the bone is Fig. 64.* somewhat quadrilateral, and prolonged on its inner side into a large process, the in- ternal malleolus. Behind the internal mal- leolus is a broad and shallow groove, for 2 lodging the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum ; and farther outwards another groove, for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. At the outer side the surface is concave and triangular, rough above for the attachment of the in- terosseous ligament; and smooth below, to articulate with the fibula. On the ex- tremity of the bone is a triangular smooth surface, for articulation with the astragalus. Development.— By three centres ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the tibia, imme- diately after the femur ; the centre for the head of the bone appears soon after birth, and that for the lower extremity during the second year ; the latter is the first to join the diaphysis. The bone is not complete until nearly the twenty-fifth year. Two occasional centres are sometimes found in the tibia, one for the tubercle, the other for the internal malleolus. Articulations.—With three bones; femur, fibula, and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.—To ten; by the internal tuberosity, to the sartorius, gra- cilis, semi-tendinosus, and semi-membra- nosus ; by the external tuberosity, tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum ; by the tubercle, ligamen- tum patellae ; by the external surface of the shaft, tibialis anticus ; and by the posterior surface, popliteus, soleus, flexor longus digi- torum, and tibialis posticus. Fibula.—The fibula (irepdvr], a brooch, from its resemblance, in conjunction with the tibia, to the pin of an ancient brooch) is the outer and smaller bone of the leg ; it is long and slender in figure, prismoid in shape, and, like other long bones, divisible into a shaft and two extremities. * Tibia and fibula of the right leg1, articulated and seen from the front. 1.

The superior extremity or head is thick ^9- 6o- and large, and depressed at the upper part by a concave surface, which articulates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Externally to this surface is a thick and rough prominence, for the attachment of . the external lateral ligament of the knee- joint, terminated behind by a styloid pro- cess, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps. The lower extremity is flattened from ■without inwards, and prolonged downwards beyond the articular surface of the tibia, forming the external malleolus. Its ex- ternal side presents a rough and triangular surface, which is subcutaneous. On the in- ternal surface is a smooth triangular facet, to articulate with the astragalus; and a rough depression, for the insertion of the interosseous ligament. The anterior border is thin and sharp ; the posterior, broad and grooved, for the tendons of the peronei muscles. To place the bone in its proper position, and ascertain to which leg it belongs, let the inferior or flattened extremity be directed downwards, and the narrow border of the malleolus forwards ; the triangular subcu- taneous surface will then point to the side corresponding with the limb of which the bone is part. The shaft of the fibula is prismoid, and presents three surfaces ; external, internal, and posterior ; and three borders. The external surface is the broadest of the three; it commences on the anterior part of the bone above, and curves around it so as to terminate on its posterior side below. This surface is completely occupied by the * Tibia and fibula of the right leg- articulated and seen from behind. 1. Articular depression for the external condyle of the femur. 2.

The internal surface commences on the side of the superior articular surface, and terminates below, by narrow- ing to a ridge which is continuous with the anterior border of the malleolus. It is marked along its middle by the interosseous ridge, which is lost above and below in the inner border of the bone. The posterior surface is twisted like the external, it commences above on the posterior side of the bone, and terminates below on its in- ternal side; at about the middle of this surface is the nutritious foramen, which is directed downwards. The internal border commences superiorly in common with the interosseous ridge, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lines, which bound the triangular subcutaneous surface of the external malleolus. The external border begins at the base of the styloid process of the head, and winds around the bone, following the direction of the corresponding surface. The posterior border, sharp and prominent, is lost inferiorly in the interosseous ridge. Development.—By three centres ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after its appearance in the tibia ; at birth the extremities are cartilaginous, an osseous deposit taking place in the inferior epiphysis during the second year, and in the superior during the fouith or fifth. The inferior epiphysis is the first to become united with the diaphysis, but the bone is not completed until nearly the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With the tibia and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.—To ten; by the head, to the tendon of the biceps and soleus ; by the shaft, its external surface, peroneus longus and brevis ; internal surface, extensor longus digitorum, ex- tensor proprius pollicis, peroneus tertius, and tibialis posticus ; by the posterior surface, popliteus and flexor longus pollicis. Tarsus.—The bones of the tarsus are seven in number-: viz., astragalus, os calcis, scaphoid, internal, middle, and external cunei- form, and cuboid. The Astragalus (os tali) may be recognised by its rounded head, a broad articular facet on its convex surface, and two articular facets, separated by a deep groove, on its concave surface. The bone is divisible into a superior and inferior surface, an ex- ternal and internal border, and an anterior and posterior extremity. The superior surface is convex, and presents a large quadrilateral and smooth facet, somewhat broader in front than behind, to articulate with the tibia. The inferior surface is concave, and divided by a deep and rough groove (sulcus tali), which lodges a strong interos- seous ligament, into two facets, the posterior large and quadran- gular, the anterior smaller and elliptic, which articulate with the os calcis. The internal border, flat and uneven, is marked by a pyriform articular surface for the inner malleolus. The external presents a large triangular articular facet, for the external malleolus,OS CALCIS. 109 and is rough and concave in front. Fig. 66 * The anterior extremity presents a rounded head, encircled by a con- striction somewhat resembling a neck; the posterior extremity is narrow, and marked by a deep groove, for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. Hold the astragalus with the broad articular surface upwards, and round- ed head forwards ; the triangular lateral articular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones: tibia, fibula, os calcis, and scaphoid. The Os calcis may be known by its large size and oblong figure, by the massive portion which forms the heel, and by two articular sur- faces, separated by a broad groove, upon its upper side. The os calcis is divisible into four surfaces, superior, inferior, external and internal; and two extremities, anterior and posterior. The su- perior surface is convex behind and irregularly concave in front, where it presents two and sometimes three articular facets, divided by a broad and shallow groove (sulcus calcanei), for the interosseous ligament. The inferior surf ace is convex and rough, and bounded posteriorly by the two inferior tuberosities, of which the internal is broad and large, the external smaller and prominent. The ex- ternal surface is convex and subcutaneous, and marked towards its anterior third by two grooves, often separated by a tubercle, for the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. The internal surface is concave and grooved, for the tendons and vessels which pass into the sole of the foot. At the anterior extremity of this surface is a projecting process (sustentaculum tali), which supports the anterior articulating surface of the astragalus, and serves as a pulley for the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum. At the anterior extremity of the bone is a flat articular surface, * Dorsal surface of the left foot. 1. Astragalus; its superior quadrilateral articular surface. 2.

The posterior extremity is prominent and convex, and constitutes the posterior tuberosity ; it is smooth for the upper half of its extent, where it corresponds with a bursa; and rough below, for the inser- tion of the tendo Achillis ; the lower part of this surface is bounded by the two inferior tuberosities. Articulations.—With two bones : astragalus and cuboid. In their articulated state a large oblique canal is situated between the astragalus and calcaneum, being formed by the apposition of the two grooves, sulcus tali and sulcus calcanei. This canal is called the sinus tarsi, and serves to lodge a strong interosseous ligament which ties the two bones together. Attachment of Muscles.—To eight: by the posterior tuberosity, to the tendo Achillis and plantaris ; by the inferior tuberosities and under surface, abductor pollicis, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor accessorius, and plantar fascia ; by the ex- ternal surface, extensor brevis digitorum. The Scaphoid bone may be distinguished by its boat-like figure, concave on one side, and convex with three facets on the other. It presents for examination an anterior and posterior surface, superior and inferior border, and two extremities, one broad, the other pointed and thick. The anterior surface is convex, and divided into three facets, to articulate with the three cuneiform bones ; the posterior is concave, to articulate with the rounded head of the as- tragalus. The superior border is convex and rough, and the in- ferior somewhat concave and uneven. The external extremity is broad and rough ; the internal pointed and prominent, forming a tuberosity. The external extremity sometimes presents a facet of articulation with the cuboid. If the bone be held so that the convex surface with three facets look forwards, and the convex border upwards, the broad extremity will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : astragalus and three cuneiform, sometimes also with the cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.—To the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The Internal cuneiform may be known by its irregular wedge- shape, and by being larger than the two other bones which bear the same name. It presents for examination a convex and a concave surface, a long and a short articular border, and a small and a large extremity. Place the bone so that the small extremity may look upwards and the long articular border forwards, the concave surface will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which it belongs. The convex surface is internal and free, and assists in forming the inner border of the foot; the concave is external, and in appo-CUNEIFORM BONES.

The small extremity (edge) is sharp ; the larger extremity (base) rounded into a broad tuberosity. Articulations.—With four bones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, and first two metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To the tibialis anticus and posticus. The Middle cuneiform is the smallest of the three ; it is wedge- shaped, the broad extremity being jty. 67.t placed upwards, the sharp end downwards in the foot. It presents «. for examination four articular sur- faces and two extremities. The anterior and posterior surjace have nothing worthy of remark. One of the lateral surfaces has a long ar- ticular facet, extending its whole length, for the internal cuneiform ; the other has only a partial articular facet for the external cuneiform bone. If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, the broadest edge of the square being towards the holder, the small and partial articular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. A rticulations.—With/owr bones: scaphoid, internal and external cu- neiform, and second metatarsal bone. The External cuneiform is in- termediate in size between the two preceding, and placed, like the middle, with the broad end up- f Sole of the left foot. 1. Inner tuberosity of the os calois. 2.

It presents for examina- tion five surfaces, and a superior and inferior extremity. The upper extremity is flat, of an oblong square form, and bevelled posteriorly, at the expense of the outer surface, into a sharp edge. If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, and the sharp border backwards, the bevelled surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With six bones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, cuboid, and second, third, and fourth metatarsal bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To the flexor brevis pollicis. The Cuboid bone is irregularly cuboid in shape, and marked on its under surface by a deep groove, for the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. It presents for examination, six surfaces, three ar- ticular, and three non-articular. The non-articular surfaces are, superior, which is slightly convex, and assists in forming the dorsum of the foot; inferior, marked by a prominent ridge, the tuberosity, and a deep groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus ; and ex- ternal, the smallest of the whole, and deeply notched by the com- mencement of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are, posterior, of large size, and concavo-convex, to articulate with the os calcis ; anterior, of smaller size, divided by a slight ridge into two facets, for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones ; and internal, a small oval articular facet, upon a large and quadrangular surface, for the external cuneiform bone. If the bone be held so that the plantar surface, with the peroneal groove, look downwards, and the largest articular surface back- wards, the small non-articular surface, marked by the deep notch, will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : os calcis, external cuneiform, fourth and fifth metatarsal bone, and sometimes the scaphoid. Attachment of Muscles.—To two: flexor brevis pollicis, and adductor pollicis. Upon a consideration of the articulations of the tarsus it will be observed, that each bone articulates with four adjoining bones, with the exception of the calcaneum which articulates with two, and the external cuneiform with six. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, with the exception of the os calcis, which has an epiphysis for its posterior tuberosity. The centres appear in the following order ; calcanean, sixth month; astragalan, seventh month; cuboid, tenth month ; external cunei- form, end of the first year ; internal cuneiform, during the third year; middle cuneiform and scaphoid, during the fourth year. The epiphysis of the calcaneum appears at the ninth year, and is united with the diaphysis at about the fifteenth. The Metatarsal bones, five in number, are long bones, and di- visible therefore into a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is113 METATARSAL BONES.—PHALANGES. prismoid, and compressed from side to side; the posterior extremity, or base, is square-shaped, to articulate with the tarsal bones, and with each other ; the anterior extremity presents a rounded head, circumscribed by a neck, to articulate with the first row of the phalanges. Peculiar Metatarsal Bones.—The first is shorter and larger than the rest, and forms part of the inner border of the foot; its posterior extremity presents only one lateral articular surface, and an oval rough prominence beneath, for the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. The anterior extremity has, on its plantar surface, two grooved facets, for sesamoid bones. The second is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones ; it presents at its base three articular facets, for the three cuneiform bones ; a large oval facet, but often no articular surface on its inner side, to articulate with the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and two externally, for the third metatarsal bone. The third may be known by two facets on the inner side of its base, corresponding with the second, and may be distinguished by its smaller size. The fourth may be distinguished by its smaller size, and by having a single articular surface on each side of the base. The fifth is recognised by its broad base, and by the large tube- rosity at its outer side. Development.—Each bone by two centres ; one for the body and one for the digital extremity in the four outer metatarsal bones ; and one for the body, the other for the base, in the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Ossification appears in these bones at the same time as in the vertebrae ; the epiphyses commencing with the great toe and proceeding to the fifth, appear towards the close of the second year, consolidation being effected at eighteen. Articulations.—With the tarsal bones by one extremity, and first row of phalanges by the other. The number of tarsal bones with which each metatarsal articulates from within outwards, is the same as between the bones of the metacarpus and carpus, one for the first, three for the second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth, forming the cipher 13121. Attachment of Muscles.—To fourteen: to the first, peroneus longus and first dorsal interosseous ; to the second, two dorsal interossei and transversus pedis ; to the third, two dorsal and one plantar in- terosseous, adductor pollicis and transversus pedis ; to the fourth, two dorsal and one plantar interosseous, adductor pollicis and trans- versus pedis ; to the fifth, one dorsal and one plantar interosseous, peroneus brevis, peroneus tertius, adductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversus pedis. Phalanges.—There are two phalanges in the great toe and three in the other toes, as in the hand. They are long bones, divisible into a central portion and extremities. i114 SESAMOID BONES. The phalanges of the first row are convex above, concave on the under surface, and compressed from side to side. The posterior extremity has a single concave articular surface, for the head of the metatarsal bone ; the anterior extremity, a pulley-like surface, for the second phalanx. The second phalanges are short and diminutive, but somewhat broader than those of the first row. The third or ungual phalanges, including the second phalanx of the great toe, are flattened from above downwards, spread out late- rally at the base to articulate with the second row, and at the oppo- site extremity to support the nail and the rounded extremity of the toe. Development.—By two centres ; one for the body and one for the metatarsal extremity. Ossification commences in these bones after the metatarsus, appearing firstly in the last phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the middle row. The bones are completed at eighteen. Articulations.—The first row with the metatarsal bones and second phalanges ; the second, of the great toe, with the first pha- lanx ; of the other toes, with the first and third phalanges ; the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-three: to the first phalanges ; great toe, innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, abductor pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis pollicis, and transversus pedis ; second toe, first dorsal and first plantar interosseous and lum- bricalis ; third toe, second dorsal and second plantar interosseous and lumbricalis ; fourth toe, third dorsal and third plantar interosseous and lumbricalis ; fifth toe, fourth dorsal interosseous, abductor mi- nimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti and lumbricalis. Second phalanges: great toe, extensor longus pollicis, and flexor longus pollicis ; other toes, one slip of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and flexor brevis digitorum. Third phalanges: two slips of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and the flexor longus digi- torum. Sesamoid bones.—These are small osseous masses, developed in those tendons which exert a certain degree of force upon the surface over which they glide, or where, by continued pressure and friction, the tendon would become a source of irritation to neighbouring parts, as to joints. The best example of a sesamoid bone is the patella, developed in the common tendon of the quadriceps extensor, and resting against the front of the knee-joint. Besides the patella, there are four pairs of sesamoid bones included in the number of pieces which compose the skeleton, two on the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of each thumb, and existing in the tendons of insertion of the flexor brevis pollicis, and two on the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons of the muscles inserted into the base ofSESAMOID BONES. 115 first phalanx. In addition to these there is often a sesamoid bone on the metacarpophalangeal joint of the little finger ; and on the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons inserted into the base of the first phalanx ; there is one also in the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone ; sometimes in the tendons, as they wind around the inner and outer malleolus ; in the psoas and iliacus, where they glide over the body of the os pubis : and in the external head of the gastrocnemius. The hones of the tympanum, as they belong to the apparatus of hearing, will be described with the anatomy of the ear.116 CHAPTER II. OF THE LIGAMENTS. The bones are variously connected with each other in the con- struction of the skeleton, and the connexion between any two bones constitutes a joint or articulation. If the joint be immovable, the surfaces of the bones are applied in direct contact ; but if motion be intended, the opposing surfaces are expanded and coated by an elastic substance named cartilage ; a fluid secreted by a membrane closed on all sides lubricates their surface, and they are firmly held together by means of short bands of glistening fibres, which are called ligaments (ligare, to bind). The study of the ligaments is termed syndesmology {<ri>v, together, decr/j,bs, bond), which, with the anatomy of the articulations, forms the subject of the present chapter. The forms of articulation met with in the human frame may be considered under three classes : Synarthrosis, Amphi-arthrosis, and Diarthrosis. Synarthrosis (criV, apdpooais, articulation) is expressive of the fixed form of joint in which the bones are immovably connected with each other. The kinds of synarthrosis are four in number. Sutura, Harmonia, Schindylesis, Gomphosis. The characters of the three first have been sufficiently explained in the preceding chapter, p. 56. It is here only necessary to state that in the construction of sutures, the substance of the bones is not in immediate contact, but separated by a layer of membrane, which is continuous externally with the pericranium and internally with the dura mater. It is the latter connexion which gives rise to the resistance experienced in tearing the calvarium from the dura mater. Cruveilhier describes this in- terposed membrane as the sutural cartilage, but its cartilaginous nature is doubtful. The fourth, Gomphosis (yop.(pos, a nail), is expressive of the insertion of one bone into another, as a nail is fixed into a board ; this is illustrated in the articulation of the teeth with the alveoli of the maxillary bones. Amphi-arthrosis (ajxtpi, both, apdpwo-ts) is a joint intermediate in aptitude for motion between the immovable synarthrosis and the movable diarthrosis. It is constituted by the approximation of sur-ARTICULATIONS. 117 faces partly coated with cartilage lined by synovial membrane, and partly connected by interosseous ligaments, or by the intervention of an elastic fibro-cartilage which adheres to the ends of both bones. Examples of this mode of articulation are seen in the union between the bodies of the vertebra, the sacrum with the coccyx, the pieces of the sternum, the sacro-iliac and pubic symphysis (aiiv <pveiv, to grow together), and according to some, the necks of the ribs, with the transverse processes. Diarthrosis (5c&, through, apOpwcns) is the movable articula- tion, which constitutes by far the greater number of the joints of the body. The degree of motion in this class has given rise to a subdivision into three genera, Arthrodia, Gfinglymus, and Enar- throsis. Arthrodia is the movable joint in which the extent of motion is slight and limited, as in the articulations of the clavicle, ribs, arti- cular processes of the vertebra?, axis with the atlas, radius with the ulna, fibula with the tibia, carpal and metacarpal, tarsal and meta- tarsal bones. Ginglymus (yiyyXvfibs, a hinge), or hinge-joint, is the movement of bones upon each other in two directions only, viz., forwards and backwards ; but the degree of motion may be very considerable. Instances of this form of joint are numerous ; they comprehend the elbow;, wrist, metacarpo-phalangeal, and phalangeal joints in the uppei" extremity ; the knee, ankle, metatarso-phalangeal, and pha- langeal joints in the lower extremity. The lower jaw may also be admitted into this category, as partaking more of the character of the hinge-joint than of the less movable arthrodia. The form of the ginglymoid joint is somewhat quadrilateral, each of its four sides being provided with a ligament, which is named from its position, anterior, posterior, internal lateral, or external lateral. The lateral ligaments are thick and strong, and the chief bond of union between the bones. The anterior and posterior are thin and loose in order to permit the required extent of movement. Enarthrosis (iv, in, apdpwais) is the most extensive in its range of motion of all the movable joints. From the manner of connexion and form of the bones in this articulation, it is called the ball-and- socket joint. There are two instances in the body, namely, the hip and the shoulder. We may add to the preceding the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb, although not strictly a ball-and-socket joint, from the great extent of motion which it enjoys, and from the nature of the ligament connecting the bones. As far as the articular surfaces are concerned, it is rather a double than a single ball-and-socket; and the whole of these considerations remove it from the simple arthro- dial and ginglymoid groups. The ball-and-socket joint has a circular form ; and, in place of the four distinct ligaments of the ginglymus, is enclosed in a bag of ligamentous membrane, called, capsular ligament.MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS. 118 The kinds of articulation may be shown in a tabular form, as follows : Sutura bones of the skull. Harmonia .... superior maxillary bones. Schindylesis . . . vomer with rostrum. Gromphosis .... teeth with alveoli. Amphi-arthrosis . Bodies of the vertebrae. Symphyses. I Arthrodia .... carpal and tarsal bones. Diarthrosis. < Gringlymus . .-. . . elbow, wrist, knee, ankle. ( Enarthrosis .... hip, shoulder. The motions of joints may be referred to four heads, viz., Glid- ing, Angular movement, Circumduction, and Rotation. 1. Gliding is the simple movement of one articular surface on another, and exists to a greater or less extent in all the joints. In the least movable joints, as in the carpus and tarsus, this is the only motion which is permitted. 2. Angular movement may be performed in four different direc- tions, either forwards and backwards, as in flexion and extension ; or, inwards and outwards, constituting adduction and abduction. Flexion and extension are illustrated in the ginglymoid joint, and exist in a large proportion of the joints of the body. Adduction and abduction conjoined with flexion and extension, are met with complete only in the most movable joints, as the shoulder, hip, and thumb. In the wrist and ankle, adduction and abduction are only partial. 3. Circumduction is most strikingly exhibited in the shoulder and hip joints ; it consists in the slight degree of motion which takes place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, while the extremity of the limb is made to describe a large circle on a plane surface. It is also seen, but in a less degree, in the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb, metacarpophalangeal articulation of the fingers and toes, and in the elbow when that joint is flexed and the end of the humerus fixed. 4. Rotation is the movement of a bone on its own axis, and is illustrated in the hip and shoulder, or better, in the rotation of the cup of the radius against the eminentia capitata of the humerus. Rotation is also observed in the movements of the atlas upon the axis, where the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns. The structures entering into the composition of a joint are, bone, cartilage, areolar tissue, fibrous tissue, yellow or elastic tissue, adipose tissue, and synovial membrane. Cartilage forms a thin coating to the articular extremities of bones, sometimes presenting a smooth surface which moves on a corresponding smooth surface of the articulating bone ; sometimes forming a plate smooth on both surfaces and interposed between the car- tilaginous ends of two bones, interarticular; and sometimes Synarthrosis.STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE. 119 acting as the connecting medium between bones without any free surface, interosseous. White fibrous tissue enters into the con- struction of joints under the form of ligament, in one situation con- stituting bands of various breadth and thickness ; in another, a layer which extends completely round the joint, and is then called a capsular ligament. All the ligaments of joints are composed of that variety of fibrous tissue termed white fibrous tissue ; but in some situations ligaments are found which consist of yellow fibrous tissue, for example, the ligamenta subflava of the arches of the vertebral column. Adipose tissue exists in variable quantity in relation with joints, where it performs, among other offices, that of a valve or spring, which occupies any vacant space that may be formed during the movements of the joint, and prevents the occur- rence of a vacuum in those cavities. This purpose of adipose tissue is exemplified in the cushion of fat at the bottom of the acetabulum and in the similar cushion behind the ligamentum patellae. Syno- vial membrane constitutes the smooth and polished lining of a joint, and contains the fluid termed synovia, by means of which the adapted surfaces are enabled to move upon each other with ease and freedom. Cartilage.—In the structure of joints, cartilage serves the double purpose of a connecting and separating medium. In the former ca- pacity possessing great strength; in the latter, smoothness and elasticity. In reference to structure it admits of classification into three kinds ; true cartilage, reticular cartilage, and fibrous cartilage. True cartilage is composed of a semitransparent homogeneous substance (hyaline or vitreous substance, matrix) containing a Fig. 68* number of minute cells (cartilage cells) dispersed at short intervals through its structure. The cells are oval, oblong, or polyhedral in * A portion of articular (true) cartilage from the head of the fibula. The section is made vertically to the surface, and magnified 155 times.

Cartilage cells have an average measurement of Y^^th of an inch in long diameter ; they are sometimes isolated, Fig. 69 * Fig. 70.f sometimes grouped in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. Near the bone they are larger than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender (fusi- form), and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish Fig. 71 % an(^ opaline in colour, its intercellular substance being semitransparent, and homogeneous or finely granular. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify ; in which case the intercellular substance becomes fibrous and more or less opaque, its co- lour yellowish, and the cells filled with a greater number of oil-globules than in its natural state. The special chemical proximate principle of the matrix of car- tilage is chondrine, its cells yielding gelatine. * Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage.

The true cartilages are, the articular, costal, ensiforin, thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid, tracheal, bronchial, nasal, meatus auris, pulley of the trochlearis muscle, and temporary cartilage or the cartilage of bone previously to ossification. * Reticular cartilage is composed of cells (T gVij-th of an inch in diameter), separated from each other by an opaque, fibrous, inter- cellular network, the breadth of the cells being considerably greater than that of the intercellular structure. The cells contain nuclei, granular matter, and oil-globules, the latter in greater number than in true cartilage; the fibres are short, imperfect, loose in texture, and yellowish ; and chemically there is an absence of chondrine. Instances of reticular cartilage are, the pinna, epiglottis, and Eus- tachian tube. Fibrous cartilage is composed of an interlacement of fasciculi of white fibrous tissue, containing in its meshes scattered groups of cartilage cells ; and the difference of density of different fibrous car- Fig. 72. t tilages is referrible to the greater or less abundance and more or less condensed state of the fibrous tissue. In some, as in interarticular cartilages, the fibrous element exists in a concentrated form, while in the intervertebral substance it is loose, and contains an abun- dance of areolar spaces. Fibrous cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups : inter- articular, stratiform, interosseous, and free. Instances of inter- articular fibrous cartilages (menisci) are those of the lower jaw, sternal and acromial end of the clavicle, wrist, carpus, knee, to which may be added the fibrous cartilages of circumference, glenoid, and cotyloid. The stratiform fibrous cartilages are such as form a thin coating to the grooves on bone through which tendons play. The interosseous fibrous cartilages are the intervertebral substance and symphysis pubis. The free fibrous cartilages are the tarsal cartilages of the eyelids. * Page 5. f A portion of fibrous cartilage. The section is made from the symphysis pubis, and magnified 155 times.WHITE FIBROUS TISSUE. 122 The development of cartilage is the same as that of cartilage of bone, the different forms of cartilage resulting from subsequent changes in the intercellular substance and cells. Thus in articular cartilage the cells undergo the lowest degree of development, are very disproportionate to the intercellular substance, and the latter remains for the most part homogeneous. In reticular cartilage the cells possess a more active growth, and surpass in bulk the inter- cellular substance, while the latter assumes a fibrous character. In fibrous cartilage, development is most energetic in the inter- cellular substance ; this is converted into fasciculi of fibrous tissue, while the interspaces are filled with cells and imperfect fibrous tissue in every stage of development. Fibrous tissue is one of the most generally distributed of all the animal tissues ; it is composed of fibres of extreme minuteness, and presents itself under two elementary forms ; namely, white fibrous tissue, and yellow fibrous or elastic tissue. In white fibrous tissue (connective tissue), the fibres are cylin- drical, exceedingly minute (about l5Q00th of an inch in diameter), transparent and undulating ; they are collected into small fasciculi (from-ginnyth *° loooo^h °f an i-ncn)> an(i these latter form larger fasciculi, which, according to their arrangement, give rise to the production of thin laminse, membranes, ligamentous bands, and tendinous cords. The connecting medium of the fibres in the for- mation of the primitive fasciculi is a transparent, structureless, interfibrous substance or blastema, to which in most situations are added numerous minute dark filaments of elastic tissue. The elastic filaments are sometimes wound spirally round the fasciculi, or inter- lace with their separate fibres ; at other times they are variously twisted, and run parallel with the fasciculi. The fasciculi are con- nected and held together in the formation of membranes and cords by loose fibres interwoven between them, or by mutual interlace- ment. White fibrous tissue is converted by boiling into gelatine. Examples of white fibrous tissue are met with in three principal forms ; namely, membrane, ligament, and tendon. The membranous form of white fibrous tissue is seen in the com- mon connecting medium of the body, namely, cellular membrane, fibro-cellular, cellular, areolar, or filamentous tissue, in which the membrane is extremely thin, and disposed in laininse, bands, or threads, leaving interstices of various size between them. It exhibits two principal forms, in one of which it is lax and serves to connect organs or parts of organs, or establish a medium of sepa- ration between them ; in the other it constitutes the condensed covering of various organs, as the periosteum, perichondrium, capsulse proprise of glands, membranes of the brain, sclerotic coat of the eyeball, pericardium, fascia ; sheaths of muscles, tendons, vessels, nerves, and ducts ; sheaths of the erectile organs, serous membrane, and the corium of the dermal and mucous membrane.123 YELLOW FIBROUS TISSUE. Ligament is the name given to those bands of various breadth and thickness which retain the articular ends of bones in contact in the construction of joints. They are glistening, but slightly- elastic, and composed of fasciculi of fibrous tissue ranged in a parallel direction side by side, or in some situations interwoven with each other. The fasciculi are held together by separate fibres, by fine elastic fibres, and by areolar tissue. Tendon is the collection of parallel fasciculi of fibrous tissue, by means of which muscles are attached to bones. They are constructed on the same principle as ligaments, are usually rounded in their figure, but in some instances are spread out so as to assume a mem- branous form. In the latter state they are called aponeuroses. Yellow fibrous tissue, or elastic tissue, enters very generally into the structure of tissues and organs in which the property of elas- ticity is an important quality, and serves the additional purpose of binding structures together. As an elastic and binding element it is present in the common cellular tissue and superficial fascia, in the fascial sheaths of muscles, in the fibrous capsules of different organs, as of the spleen, in the corium of. the skin, in serous and mucous membranes, in the coats of blood-vessels and ducts; and, in certain situations is the sole tissue present, as in the ligamenta subfiava, chordae vocales, thyro-epiglottic ligament, crico-thyroidean mem- brane,; the membranous layers connecting the cartilaginous rings of the trachea and bronchial tubes, the ligamentum nucha?, and liga- mentum suspensorium penis. It is also met with around some parts of the alimentary canal, as the oesophagus, cardia, and anus, and around the male and female urethra. The fibres of elastic tissue are cylindrical or flattened, brittle, colourless when single but yellowish in an aggregated form, elastic, admitting of being stretched to double their length and returning to their original size, and variable in dimensions, ranging from extreme fineness to a considerable breadth. They present them- selves, therefore, in the two forms of fine and coarse, and are distributed among the textures of the body either as single and isolated filaments or as a network. Isolated elastic fibres of extreme fineness are met with coiled around or entwined among the fasciculi of areolar tissue, hold- ing them together, and have received the name of nuclear fibres, from their supposed origin in the nuclei of the formative cells, There seems, however, to be no reason for the belief of their origin being different from that of other primitive tissues, namely, from cells. The elastic network formed by these fibres may be extremely fine and delicate as in thin membranes; or it may be coarser, as in the various ligamentous bands composed of this tissue ; or it may be spread out like a membrane, the interstices forming but a small part of its extent, as in the fenestrated membrane of the arteries. In the construction of yellow elastic ligaments, the fibres communicate124 ADIPOSE TISSUE.—SYNOVIAL. MEMBRANE. with each other by means of short oblique bands which unite with adjoining fibres at acute or obtuse angles without any enlargement of the fibre with which they are joined. This circumstance has given rise to the idea of the fibres giving off branches, an expression derived from the division of blood-vessels, and another term bor- rowed from the same source has been applied to their communication with each other, namely, inosculation ; but both these expressions in their literal meaning are incorrect. When yellow fibrous tissue is cut or torn, the fibres, in consequence of their elasticity, become clubbed and curved at the extremity, a special character of this tissue. Adipose tissue is composed of minute cells, aggregated together in clusters of various size within the areolae of common cellular tissue. The cells of adipose tissue are identical in manner of formation with other cells, being developed around nuclei, and increasing in size by the formation of fluid in their interior. In adipose cells, this fluid, instead of being albuminous as in other cells, is oleaginous, the oil at first appearing in separate globules, which subsequently coalesce into a single drop. The size of adipose cells at their full development is about -5^5-th of an inch in diameter; when isolated they are globular in form, but are hexagonal or poly- hedral when compressed. They are perfectly transparent, the cell- membrane being structureless and their nucleus disappearing as they attain their full size. Synovial membrane is a thin membranous layer, investing the articular extremities of bones, and the surface of the liga- ments which surround and enter into the composition of a joint. It resembles the serous membranes in being a shut sac (capsula synovialis), and secretes a transparent and viscous fluid, which is named synovia. Synovia is an alkaline secretion, contain- ing albumen and mucus, the albumen being coagulable at a boiling temperature. In some joints the synovial membrane is pressed into the articular cavity by a cushion of fat: this mass was called by Havers the synovial gland, from an idea of its being the source of the synovia ; it is found in the hip and knee joint. In the knee, moreover, the synovial membrane forms folds, which are improperly named ligaments, as the mucous and alar ligaments, the two latter being an appendage to the cushion of fat. Besides the synovial membranes entering into the composition of joints, there are numerous smaller sacs of a similar kind interposed between surfaces which move upon each other so as to cause friction ; they are often associated with the articulations. These are the bursas mucosa; they are shut sacs, analogous in structure to synovial membranes, and secreting a similar synovial fluid. The epithelium of synovial membranes is of the kind termed tesselated or pavement epithelium; it is developed in the same manner as the epithelium of other free surfaces, but presents only a single stratum of cells.125 ARTICULATIONS. The joints may be arranged, according to a natural division, into those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. Ligaments op the Trunk.—The articulations of the trunk are divisible into ten groups, namely, 1. Of the vertebral column. 2. Of the atlas, with the occipital bone. 3. Of the axis, with the occipital bone. 4. Of the atlas, with the axis. 5. Of the lower jaw. 6. Of the ribs, with the vertebrae. 7. Of the ribs, with the sternum, and with each other. 8. Of the sternum. 9. Of the vertebral column, with the pelvis. 10. Of the pelvis. 1. Articulation of the Vertebral column. The ligaments con- necting together the different pieces of the vertebral column, admit of the same arrangement as the vertebras themselves. Thus the ligaments Of the bodies, are the Anterior common ligament, Of the transverse processes, Inter-transverse. Bodies.—The Anterior common ligament (fascia longitudinalis anterior) is a broad and riband-like band of ligamentous fibres, ex- tending along the front surface of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the interver- tebral substance, and less closely with the bodies of the vertebrae. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lumbar, and consists of a median and two lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of vessels. The ligament is composed of fibres of various length closely inter- woven with each other ; the deeper and shorter crossing the inter- vertebral substance from one vertebra to the next; the superficial and longer fibres crossing three or four vertebrae. The anterior common ligament is in relation by its posterior or Posterior common ligament, Intervertebral substance. Of the arches, Of the articular processes, Ligamenta subflava. Capsular ligaments, Synovial membranes. Of the spinous processes, Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous.126 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. Fig. 74.f vertebral surface, with the intervertebral substance, bodies of the ver- tebrae, and vessels, principally veins, which separate its central from its lateral portions. By its anterior or visceral surface it is'in relation, in the neck, with the longus colli mus- cles, pharynx and oesophagus ; in the thoracic region, with the aorta, venae azygos, and thoracic duct; in the lumbar region, with the aorta, right renal artery, right lumbar arteries, arteria sacra media, vena cava infe- rior, left lumbar veins, receptaculum chyli, commencement of the thoracic duct, and tendons of the diaphragm with the fibres of which the liga- mentous fibres interlace. The Posterior common ligament (fascia longitudinalis posterior) lies on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, and extends from the axis to the sacrum. It is broad opposite the intervertebral sub- stance, to which it is closely adherent ; narrow and thick over the bodies of the vertebrae, from which it is separated by the veins of the base of each vertebra; and composed, like the anterior ligament, of shorter and longer fibres, arranged in a similar manner. It is broader above than below, the reverse of the anterior common ligament. The posterior common ligament is in relation by its anterior surface, with the intervertebral substance, bodies of the vertebrae, and venae basium vertebrarum ; by its posterior surface, with the dura mater of the spinal cord, some loose cel- lular tissue and numerous small veins being interposed. * Anterior ligament of the vertebrae, and ligaments of the ribs. 1.

Fig. 75.* the imbricated position of the The Intervertebral substance (ligamentum intervertebrals) is a lenticular disk of fibrous cartilage, interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum, and retaining them firmly in connexion with each other. It varies in thickness in different parts of the column, and at different points of the same disk, being thickest in the lumbar region, deepest in front in the cervical and lumbar region, and behind in the dorsal region ; and contributes to the formation of the natural curves of the vertebral column. The aggregate thickness of the intervertebral substance has been esti- mated at one-fourth that of the entire vertebral column, exclusive of the sacrum and coccyx. When the intervertebi al substance is bisected either horizontally or vertically, it is seen to be composed of a series of layers of dense fibrous tissue, separated by interstices filled with the softer kind. The central part of each intervertebral disk is wholly made up of this softer fibrous cartilage, which has the appearance of pulp, and is so elastic as to rise above the level of the section as soon as its division is completed. Examined from the exterior, the layers •are found to consist of fibres passing obliquely between the two ver- tebrae, in one layer passing from left to right, in the next from right to left, alternating in each successive layer. Arches.—The ligamenta subflava are two thin planes of yellow fibrous tissue, situated between the arches of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum. From laminae, they are attached to the posterior surface of the vertebra below, and the ante- rior surface of the arch of the vertebra above, being sepa- rated from each other at the middle line by a slight inter- space. They counteract, by their elasticity, the efforts of the flexor muscles of the trunk; and, preserving the upright position of the spine, limit the expenditure of muscular force. They are longest in the cervical and thickest in the lumbar region. The ligamenta subflava are in relation by both surfaces with the meningo-rachidian veins, and, internally, are separated from the dura mater of the spinal cord by those veins and some loose cellular and adipose tissue. * Internal view of the arches of three vertebrae. To obtain this view the laminae have been divided through their pedicles. 1. One of the ligamenta subflava. 2. The capsular ligament of one side.128 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. Articular processes.—The ligaments of the articular processes of the vertebrae (ligamenta processuum obliquorum) are thin capsules of ligamentous fibres which surround and enclose the synovial mem- brane; the latter being looser in the cervical than in the other regions of the spine. Spinous processes. — The interspinous ligaments (membrana interspinalis), thin and membranous, are extended between the spinous processes in the dorsal and lumbar region; being thickest in the latter. They are in relation with the multifidus spinse muscle at each side. The Supraspinous ligament (ligamenta apicum, fig. 83) is a strong, fibrous cord, extending from the apex of the spinous process ment upwards to the tuberosity of the occipital bone, constitutes the rudimentary ligamentum nuchse of man. The latter is strengthened, as in animals, by a thin slip from the spinous process of each cervical vertebra. Transverse processes.—The intertransverse ligaments, thin and membranous, are found, only, between the transverse processes of the lower dorsal vertebrae. 2. Articulation of the Atlas with the Occipital hone.—The liga- ments of this articulation are seven in number : Two anterior occipito-atloid, Lateral oceipito-atloid, Posterior occipito-atloid, Two capsular. * Anterior view of the ligaments connecting the atlas, axis and occipital bone.

Like the anterior and posterior common ligaments, it is composed of fibres of un- equal length, the deeper fibres passing from one vertebra to the next, the superficial fibres extending over several spinous pro- cesses. It is thickest in the lumbar region. The continuation of this liga-129 LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. Of the two anterior ligaments, one is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line, and superficially to the other; it is attached above to the basilar process of the occipital bone ; below, to the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The deeper ligament is a broad membranous layer, attached above to the margin of the occipital foramen, be- tween the two condyles ; and below, to the whole length of the anterior arch of the atlas. It is in relation in front with the recti antici minores, behind with the odontoid ligaments. The posterior ligament is thin and membranous ; attached above to the margin of the occipital foramen, between the two condyles; and below, to the posterior arch of the atlas. It is Fig. 77.* closely adherent to the dura mater, by its inner surface ; and forms a ligamentous arch at each side, for the passage of the vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. It is in relation posteriorly with the recti postici minores and ob- liqui superiores. The lateral ligaments are strong fasciculi of ligamen- tous fibres, attached below to the base of the transverse process of the atlas at each side ; and above, to the transverse process cf the occipital bone. With the assistance of a ligamentous expansion derived from the vaginal process of the temporal bone, these ligaments form a strong sheath around the vessels and nerves which pass through the carotid and jugular foramen. The capsular ligaments (condylo-atloidea) are the thin and loose ligamentous capsules which surround the synovial membranes of the articulations between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articular processes of the atlas. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous on th e anterior and external part of the articulation. The movements taking place between the cranium and atlas are those of flexion and erection, giving rise to the forward nodding of the head. When this motion is increased to any extent, the whole of the cervical region concurs in its production. 3.

The occipito-axoid ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a the dura mater ; and is sometimes described as consisting of a cen- tral and two lateral portions. The odontoid ligaments (alaria) are two short and thick fasciculi, which pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process, to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. A third and smaller fasciculus (ligamentum dentis suspensorium) proceeds from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. These ligaments serve to limit the extent of rotation of the head, hence they are termed check ligaments. 4. Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis.—The ligaments of this articulation arejive in number,— The anterior ligament consists of ligamentous fibres, which pass from the anterior tubercle and arch of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis, where they are continuous with the commencement of the anterior common ligament. The posterior ligament is a thin, membranous layer, passing be- tween the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminse of the axis. The capsular ligaments surround the articular processes of the atlas and axis; they are loose, to permit of the free movement which subsists between these vertebrae. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous on the outer and anterior part of the articulation; and * Upper part of the vertebral canal, opened from behind in order to show the occipito-axoid ligament. 1.

It is firmly connected opposite the body of the axis, with Anterior atlo-axoid, Posterior atlo-axoid, Two capsular, Transverse.131 LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. the synovial membrane usually communicates with the synovial cavity between the transverse ligament and odontoid process. The transverse liga- ment is a strong liga- 79 * mentous band, which arches across the area of the ring of the atlas from a rough tubercle on the inner surface of one articular process to a corresponding tubercle on the other; and serves to retain the odontoid process of the axis, in connexion with the an- terior arch of the atlas. As it crosses the neck of the odontoid process, some fibres are sent downwards to be attached to the body of the axis, and others pass upwards to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone ; hence the ligament has a cross-like appearance, and is termed cruci- form. A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligament and odontoid process ; and another between that process and the anterior arch of the atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiar disposition of the transverse ligament in relation to the odontoid process, that enables the atlas, and with it the entire cranium, to rotate upon the axis ; the perfect freedom of movement between these bones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower part of the ring, formed by the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, while the sum- mit of the odontoid process is larger than its base; hence the process is retained in its place by the transverse ligament, when the other ligaments are cut through. The extent to which rotation of the head upon the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid or check ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axoid ligament. 5.

Fig. 80.* The external lateral j / ligament is a short and thick band of fibres, passing obliquely back- wards from the tu- bercle of the zygoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. It is in relation, externally, with the integument of the face; internally, with the two synovial mem- branes of the articu- lation and the interarticular cartilage. The external lateral ligament acts conjointly with its fellow of the opposite condyle in the move- ments of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament (spheno-maxillary) has no connexion with, the articulation of the lower jaw, and is, therefore, incorrectly named; it is a thin aponeu- Fig. 81.t rotic expansion extending from the extremity of the spinous process of the sphe- noid bone to the margin of the dental foramen ; and is piei'ced at its insertion by the mylo-hyoidean nerve.

The capsular ligament (membrana maxillse articularis) consists of numerous irregular ligamentous fibres, which pass from the edge of the glenoid cavity to the neck of the lower jaw, and surround the articulation; on the inner side of the joint they form a pretty strong fasciculus. The interarticular fibrous cartilage (cartilago intermedia) is a thin oval plate, thicker at the edges than in the centre, placed horizontally between the head of the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity. It is connected by its outer border with the external lateral ligament, and receives in front some fibres, of in- sertion of the external pterygoid muscle. It divides the joint into two cavities, one being above, the other below the cartilage; but it is occasionally incomplete in the centre. The synovial membranes are situated, one above, the other below the fibrous cartilage, the former being the larger of the two. When the fibrous cartilage is perforate, the synovial membranes com- municate. Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete interarticular cartilage, and, consequently, with two synovial membranes ; they are, the sterno-clavicular, acromio- clavicular, and the articulation of the ulna with the cuneiform bone. 'The interarticular fibrous cartilages of the Jcnee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membrane. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two syno- vial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament without fibrous cartilage. Connected with the lower . jaw, though not with the joint, is the stylo-maxillary liga- ment, a process of the deep cervical fascia extended be- tween the point of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw. It is attached to the jaw between the insertions of the masseter and internal ptery- goid muscle, and separates the parotid from the sub- maxillary gland. * In this sketch, a section has been made through the joint, to show the position of the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the manner of its adaptation to the articulating surfaces. 1.

Actions.—The movements of the lower jaw are depression, by which the mouth is opened, elevation, by which it is closed ; a for- ward and backward movement, and a movement from side to side. In the movement of depression the interarticular cartilage glides forward on the eminentia articularis, carrying with it the condyle. If this movement be carried too far, the superior synovial membrane is ruptured, and dislocation of the fibro-cartilage with its condyle into the zygomatic fossa occurs. In elevation the fibrous cartilage and condyle are returned to their original position. The forward and backward movement is a gliding of the fibro-cartilage on the glenoid articular surface, in the anteroposterior direction ; and the movement from side to side, in the lateral direction. 6. Articulation of the Ribs with the Vertebra?.—The ligaments of these articulations are remarkable for their strength, being in fact so strong as to render dislocation impossible ; the neck of the rib must break before displacement could occur : they are divisible into two groups :—1. Those connecting the head of the rib with the bodies of the vertebral; and, 2. Those connecting the neck and tubercle of the rib with the transverse processes. 1st Group. 2nd Group. Anterior costo-vertebral or stellate, Anterior costo-transverse, Capsular, Middle costo-transverse, Interarticular ligament, Posterior costo-transverse. Two synovial membranes. The anterior costo-vertebral or stellate ligament (lig. capituli costarum, fig. 73) consists of three short bands of ligamentous fibres which radiate from the anterior part of the head of the rib. The superior band passes upwards to be attached to the vertebra above ; the middle fasciculus is attached to the intervertebral substance ; the inferior to the vertebra below. In the first, eleventh, and tv;elfth rib, the three fasciculi are attached to the body of the corresponding vertebra. The capsular ligament is a thin layer of ligamentous fibres sur- rounding the joint in the interval left by the anterior ligament; it is thickest above and below the articulation, and protects the synovial membranes. The interarticular ligament is a thin band which passes between the sharp crest on the head of the rib and the intervertebral sub- stance. It divides the joint into two cavities, each being furnished with a separate synovial membrane. The first, eleventh, and twelfth rib have no interarticular ligament, and consequently but one synovial membrane. The anterior costo-transverse ligament (lig. transversarium in- ternum) is a broad band composed of two fasciculi, which ascend from the crest-like ridge on the neck of the rib, to the transverseLIGAMENTS OF THE RIBS. 135 process immediately above. This ligament separates the anterior from the dorsal branch of the intercostal nerve. The middle costo-transverse ligament (lig. cervicis externum) is a strong interosseous ligament passing directly between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib, and the transverse process against which it rests. It is absent in the first and two inferior ribs. The posterior costo-transverse ligament (lig. transversarium ex- ternum) is a small but strong fasciculus, passing obliquely from the tubercle of the rib to the apex of the transverse process. The articulation between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process is provided with a small synovial membrane. There is no anterior costo- ^ transverse ligament to the first *9j or last rib ; and only rudi- mentary posterior costo-trans- verse ligaments to the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Several ac- cessory bands (ligamenta ac- cessoria) are found passing between the transverse pro- cesses and the ribs ; a broad band of this kind connects the last rib with the transverse process:of the first or second lumbar vertebra. A ctions.—The movements permitted by the articulations of the ribs are upwards, down- wards, and slightly forwards and backwards; the move- ment increasing in extent from the head to the extremity of the rib. The forward and backward movement is trifling in the seven superior, but greater in the inferior ribs ; the eleventh and twelfth are very movable. 7. Articulation of the Ribs with the Sternum, and with each other.—The ligaments of the costo-sternal articulations are— Anterior costo-sternal, Superior costo-sternal, Posterior costo-sternal, Inferior costo-sternal, Synovial membranes. The anterior costo-sternal ligament (lig. costo-sternale radiatum) is a thin band of ligamentous fibres, passing in a radiated direction from the extremity of the costal cartilage to the anterior surface of * Posterior view of part of the thoracic portion of the vertebral column, showing the ligaments connecting the vertebrae with each other and the ribs with the vertebrae. 1,1.

Posterior costo-transverse ligaments.LIGAMENTS OF THE STERNUM. 136 the sternum, and intermingling its fibres with those of the ligament of the opposite side, and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoralis major muscle. The posterior costo-sternal ligament, much smaller than the anterior, consists of a thin fasciculus of fibres, situated on the posterior surface of the articulation. The superior and inferior costo-sternal ligaments are narrow fasciculi corresponding with the breadth of the cartilage, and con- necting its superior and inferior border with the side of the sternum. The synovial membrane is absent in the articulation of the first rib, its cartilage being usually adherent to the sternum ; that of the second rib has an int,erarticular ligament, with two synovial mem- branes ; the synovial membranes of the other costal cartilages are single. The sixth and seventh ribs have several fasciculi of strong liga- mentous fibres, passing from the extremity of their cartilages to the anterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, which latter they are in- tended to support. They are named the costo-xyphoid ligaments. The sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the fifth and the ninth costal cartilages, have articulations with each other, and a synovial membrane for each articulation. They are connected by ligamentous fibres (ligamenta corruscantia), which pass from one cartilage to the other, external and internal ligaments. The ninth and tenth are connected at their extremity by liga- mentous fibres, but have no synovial membrane. Actions.—The movements of the costo-sternal articulations are very trifling, being limited to a slight degree of sliding motion. The first rib is the least, the second the most movable. 8. Articulation of the Sternum.—The pieces of the sternum are connected by means of a thin plate of interosseous cartilage placed between each, and by an anterior and posterior ligament (membrana ossium sterni). The fibres of the anterior sternal ligament are longitudinal in direction, but so blended with the anterior costo- sternal ligaments and tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoral muscles, as scarcely to be distinguished as a distinct ligament. The posterior sternal ligament is a broad smooth plain of longitudinal fibres, placed on the posterior surface of the bone, and extending from the manubrium to the ensiform cartilage. These ligaments contribute very materially to the strength of the sternum and elasticity of the front of the chest; their continuation down- wards on the ensiform cartilage constitutes the sterno-xyphoid ligaments. 9. Articulation of the Vertebral Column with the Pelvis.—The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the sacrum by the same ligaments as those with which the various vertebrae are connected to each other ; viz., anterior and posterior common ligament, inter-LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 137 vertebral substance, ligamenta subflava, capsular ligaments, inter- spinous and supra-spinous ligament. There are, however, two proper ligaments connecting the vertebral column with* the pelvis ; these are, the Lumbo-sacral, Lumbo-iliac. The lumbo-sacral or sacro-vertebral ligament is a thick triangular fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, connected above with the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and below with the posterior part of the upper border of the sacrum. The lumbo-iliac or ilio-lumbar ligament passes from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to that part of the crest of the ilium which surmounts the sacro-iliac articulation. It is triangular in form. 10. Articulations of the Pelvis.—The ligaments of the articula- tions of the pelvis are divisible into four groups :—1, those con- necting the sacrum and ilium; 2, those passing between the sacrum and ischium; 3, between the sacrum and coccyx; and, 4, between the two pubic bones. r 1st, Between the sacrum and ilium. Sacro-iliac anterior, Sacro-iliac posterior. i 2nd, Between the sacrum and ischium^ Sacro-ischiatic anterior (short), Sacro-ischiatic posterior (long)\ 3rd, Between the sacrum and coccyx: Sacro-coccygean anterior, Sacro-coccygean posterior. 4th, Between the ossa pubis. Anterior pubic, Superior pubic, Posterior pubic, Sub-pubic, Interosseous fibro-cartilage. 1. Between the Sacrum and Ilium.—The anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of numerous short ligamentous bands and fibres, which pass from bone to bone on the anterior surface of the joint. The posterior sacro-iliac or interosseous ligament (ileo-sacrale breve) is composed of numerous strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which pass horizontally between the rough surfaces of the posterior half of the sacro-iliac articulation, and constitute the principal bond of connexion between the sacrum and ilium. One fasciculus of this ligament, longer and larger than the rest, is dis- tinguished, from its direction, by the name of oblique sacro-iliac ligament (ileo-sacrale longum). It is attached, by one extremity, to the posterier superior spine of the ilium ; and, by the other, to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum.Fig. 84.* gament. The anterior LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 138 which is thicker on the The surfaces of the two bones forming the sacro-iliac articulation are partly covered with cartilage, and partly rough and connected by the interosseous li- or auricular half is coated with cartilage, sacrum than on the ilium. The surface of the cartilage is un™ even, and provided with a delicate syno- vial membrane, not demonstrable in the adult, but apparent in the young subject and in the female during pregnancy. 2. Between the Sa- crum and Ischium.— The anterior or lesser sacro-ischiatic liga- ment (sacro-ischiadi- cum minus) is thin, and triangular in form ; it is attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium ; and by its broad extremity to the side of the sacrum and coccyx, interlacing its fibres with the greater sacro- ischiatic ligament. The anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the coccygeus muscle ; behind, with the posterior ligament, with which its fibres are intermingled. By its upper border it forms part of the lower boundary of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and by the lower, part of the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. The posterior or greater sacro-ischiatic ligament (sacro-ischia- dicum majus), larger, thicker, and posterior to the preceding, is narrower in the middle than at each extremity. It is attached, by its smaller end, to the inner margin of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium ; where it forms a falciform process, which protects the internal pudic artery, and is continuous with the obturator fascia. By its larger extremity it is inserted into the side of the coccyx, sacrum, and posterior inferior spine of the ilium. The posterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, * Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint. 1.

By its superior border it forms part of the boundary of the lesser ischiatic foramen, and by its lower border, part of the boundary of the perinasum. It is pierced by the coccygeal branch of the ischiatic artery. The two ligaments convert the sacro-ischiatic notches into foramina. 3. Between the Sacrum and Coccyx.—The anterior sacro-coccy- gean ligajnent is a thin fasciculus passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The posterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and con- nects the sacrum with the coccyx posteriorly, extending as far as the apex of the latter bone. Fig. 85 * Between the two bones is a thin disk of soft fibrous cartilage ; and in females not unfrequently a synovial membrane.

Betioeen the Ossa Pubis.—The anterior pubic ligament is composed of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely across the union of the two bones from side to side, and form an interlacement in front of the symphysis. The posterior pubic ligament consists of a few irregular bands of fibres uniting the pubic bones posteriorly. The superior pubic ligament is a thick band of fibres connecting the angles of the ossa pubis superiorly, and filling the inequalities of the surface of the bones. The sub-pubic ligament is a thick arch of fibres connecting the two bones inferiorly, and forming the tipper boundary of the pubic arch. The interosseous fibro-cartilage unites the two surfaces of the pubic bones, in the same manner as the intervertebral substance connects the bodies of the vertebras. It resembles the inter- vertebral substance also in being composed of oblique fibres dis- posed in concentric layers, which are more dense towards the surface than near the centre. It is thick in front, and thin behind ; and a synovial membrane is sometimes found in the posterior half of the articulation. This articulation becomes movable towards the latter term of pre- gnancy, and admits of a slight degree of separation of its surfaces. The obturator ligament (membrana obturatoria) is not a ligament of articulation, but simply a ligamentous membrane stretched across the obturator foramen. It gives attachment by its surfaces to' the two obturator muscles, and leaves a space in the upper part of the foramen for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The numerous vacuities in the walls of the pelvis, and their . closure by ligamentous structures, as in the case of the sacro- ischiatic fissures and obturator foramina, serve to diminish the pressure on the soft parts during the passage of the head of the foetus through the pelvis in parturition. LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The Ligaments of the upper extremity may be arranged in the order of the articulations of the different bones : they are, 1. Sterno-clavicular articulation. 4. Shoulder joint. 2. Scapuloclavicular articulation. 5. Elbow joint. 3. Ligaments of the scapula. 6. Radio-ulnar articulation. 7. Wrist joint. 8, Articulation between the carpal bones. 9. Carpo-metacarpal articulation. 10. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. 11. Articulation of the phalanges.STERNOCLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. 141 1. Sterno-clavicular Articulation.—The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial articulation ; its ligaments are, Anterior sterno-clavicular, Inter-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Costo-clavicular (rhomboid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad ligamentous layer, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, and covering the anterior aspect of the articulation. This ligament is in relation by its anterior surface with the integument and sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and behind with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and synovial membranes. The posterior-sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad band cover- ing the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and syno- vial membranes ; and behind, with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscle. i The anterior and posterior ligaments are continuous at the upper and lower part of the articulation, so as to form a capsule around the joint. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely adherent to the upper border of the sternum. It is separated by cellular tissue from the sterno-thyroid muscles. The costo-clavicular ligament (rhomboides) is a thick fasciculus of fibres, connecting the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the * Ligaments of the sterno-clavicular and costo-sternal articulations. 1.

It is placed obliquely between the rib and under surface of the clavicle ; and is in relation, in front, with the tendon of origin of the subclavius muscle, and behind with the subclavian vein. The rupture of the rhomboid ligament in dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle gives rise to the peculiar deformity of that ac- cident. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the edges than in the centre. It is attached above, to the clavicle ; below, to the cartilage of the first rib ; and throughout the rest of its circumference to the anterior and posterior sterno- clavicular ligament. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are lined by separate synovial membranes; is sometimes pierced through its centre, and not unfrequently deficient, to a greater or less extent, at its lower part. Actions.—The movements of the sterno-clavicular articulation are, a gliding movement of the fibro-cartilage with the clavicle, on the articular surface of the sternum, in the directions, forward, backward, upward, and downward; and circumduction. This articulation is the centre of the movements of the shoulder. 2. Scapuloclavicular Articulation. — The ligaments of the scapular end of the clavicle are, Superior acromio-clavicular, Inferior acromio-clavicular, Coraco-clavicular (trapezoid and conoid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The superior acromio-clavicular ligament is a moderately thick plane of fibres passing between the extremity of the clavicle and the acromion, on the upper surface of the joint. The inferior acromio-clavicular ligament is a thin plane situated on the under surface. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a capsule around the arti- culation. The coraco-clavicular ligament (trapezoides, conoides) is a thick fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, passing obliquely between the base of the coracoid process and under surface of the clavicle, and hold- ing the end of the clavicle in firm connexion with the scapula. Seen from before, it has a quadrilateral form ; hence its name trapezoid; examined from behind, it is triangular, the base being upwards; hence its other name, conoid. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is often indistinct, from having partial connexions with the fibro-cartilaginous surfaces of the two bones between which it is placed ; and is not unfrequently absent. When partial, it occupies the upper part of the articulation. The143 LIGAMENTS OP THE SCAPULA. synovial membranes are thin; and when the fibro-cartilage is in- complete, there is but one. Fig. 87.* A ctions. — The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two movements, gliding of the surfaces on each other, and rotation of the scapula on the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are, Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament (triangulare) is a broad and thick triangular band, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion proeess, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle ; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually interposed. The transverse or coracoid ligament (supra-scapulare) is a narrow * Ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1. Superior acromio-clavi- cular ligament. 2.

The supra-scapular nerve passes through this foramen, the artery over it. 4. Shoulder Joint. — The scapulo-humeral articulation is an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint; its ligaments are, Capsular, Coraco-humeral, Glenoid. The capsular ligament encloses the articulating head of the scapula and head of the humerus, and is attached to the neck of each bone. It is thick above, where resistance is most required, and strengthened by the tendons of the supra-spinatus, infraspina- tus, teres minor, and subscapularis, muscles : below it is thin and loose. The capsule is incomplete at the point of contact of the tendons, which consequently obtain on their inner surface a lining of synovial membrane. The coraco-humeral ligament is a broad band which descends obliquely outwards from the border of the coracoid process to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and serves to strengthen the superior and anterior part of the capsular ligament. The glenoid; ligament is the prismoid band of fibro-cartilage, which is attached around the margin of the glenoid surface for the purpose of protecting its edge and deepening its cavity. It divides superiorly into two slips which are continuous with the long tendon of the biceps; hence the ligament is sometimes described as being formed by the splitting of that tendon. The cavity of the articulation is traversed by the long tendon of the biceps which is enclosed in a sheath of synovial membrane in its passage through the joint. The synovial membrane of the shoulder joint is extensive; it communicates anteriorly through an opening (foramen ovale) in the capsular ligament with a large bursal sac, which lines the under surface of the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Superiorly it frequently communicates through another opening in the capsular ligament with a bursal sac belonging to the infra-spinatus muscle ; and it moreover forms a sheath around that portion of the tendon of the biceps which is included within the joint. The muscles immediately surrounding the shoulder joint are, the subscapularis, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, long head of the triceps, and deltoid ; the long tendon of the biceps is within the capsular ligament. Actions.—The shoulder joint is capable of every variety of mo- tion, viz., of movement forwards and backwards, of abduction and adduction, of circumduction and rotation. 5. Elbow Joint.—The elbow is a ginglymoid articulation; and its ligaments four in number, namely,ELBOW JOINT. 145 Anterior, Internal lateral, Posterior, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer, descending from the anterior surface of the humerus immediately above the joint, to the coronoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament. It is connected on each side with the lateral ligaments; and is composed of Fig. 88.* fibres which pass in three different directions, vertical, transverse, and oblique, the latter being extended downwards and outwards to the orbicular ligament, into which they are inserted inferiorly. This ligament is covered in by the brachial]'s anticus muscle. The posterior ligament is a broad and loose layer passing between the posterior surface of the humerus and the anterior sur- face of the base of the olecranon, and con- nected at each side with the lateral liga- ments. It is covered in by the tendon of the triceps. The internal lateral ligament (brachio- cubitale)is a thick triangular layer, attached above, by its apex, to the internal condyle of the humerus; and below, by its expanded border, to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, extending from the coro- noid process to the olecranon. At its in- sertion it is intermingled with some trans- verse fibres ; and posteriorly is in relation with the ulnar nerve. . The external lateral ligament (brachio- radiale) is a strong and narrow band, which descends from the external condyle of the humerus, to be inserted into the orbicular ligament and the ridge on the ulna with which the posterior part of the latter ligament is connected. This ligament is closely united with the tendon of origin of the supinator brevis muscle. The synovial membrane is extensive, and is reflected from the cartilaginous surfaces of the bones upon the inner surface of the ligaments. It surrounds inferiorly the head of the radius, and forms an articulating sac between it and the lesser sigmoid notch.

Actions.—The movements of the elbow joint are flexion and extension; the extent of these movements being limited, in front by the coronoid process, and behind by the olecranon. 6. Radio-ulnar Articulation.—The ra- I dius and ulna are firmly held together by ligaments, connected with both extremities of the bones, and with the shaft; they are, Orbicular, Oblique, Interosseous, Anterior inferior, Posterior inferior, Interarticular fibro-cartilage. jiL'i^ j The orbicular ligament (annulare, coro- H jj'l nale) is a firm band several lines in breadth, ffi' l'ji J which surrounds the head of the radius, and {m ij is attached by each end to an extremity of M \ the lesser sigmoid cavity. It is strongest ! behind where it receives the external lateral If j jV/V i I ligament, and is lined on its inner surface 1 i ' by a reflection of the synovial membrane of 1 ^ the elbow joint. The rupture of this ligament permits the dislocation of the head of the radius. The oblique ligament (called also ligamentum teres, in contra- distinction to the interosseous ligament) is a narrow slip of liga- mentous fibres, descending obliquely from the base of the coronoid process of the ulna to the inner side of the radius, a little below its tuberosity. The interosseous ligament (membrana interossea) is a broad and thin plane of aponeurotic fibres passing obliquely downwards from the sharp ridge on the radius to that on the ulna. It is deficient superiorly, broader in the middle than at each extremity, and * External view of the elbow joint. 1. Humerus. 2. Ulna. 3. Radius. 4.

The posterior interosseous artery passes backwards between the oblique ligament and upper border of the interosseous ligament. The interosseous ligament affords an extensive surface for the attachment of muscles ; and is in relation, in front, with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, pronator quadratus, and anterior interosseous artery and nerve ; behind, with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, extensor indicis, and near the wrist with the anterior interosseous artery and posterior interosseous nerve. The anterior inferior ligament is a thin band of fibres, passing transversely between the radius and ulna. The posterior inferior ligament, also thin and loose, has the same disposition on the posterior surface of the articulation. The inter articular, or triangular fibrocartilage, acts the part of a ligament between the lower extremity of the radius and ulna. It is inserted by its apex into a depression on the inner surface of the styloid process of the ulna, and attached by its base to the edge of the radius. This fibrocartilage is lined on the upper surface by a synovial membrane, which forms a remarkably loose capsule be- tween the radius and ulna, and is called the membrana sacciformis. By its lower surface it enters into the articulation of the wrist joint. Actions.—The movements taking place between the radius and ulna are, rotation of the former upon the latter ; rotation forwards being termed pronation, and rotation backwards supination. In these movements the head of the radius turns upon its axis, within the orbicular ligament and lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna ; while inferiorly, the radius presents a concavity which moves on the rounded head of the ulna. The movements of the radius are chiefly limited by the anterior and posterior inferior ligaments ; hence these are not unfrequently ruptured in great muscular . efforts. 7. Wrist Joint.—The wrist is a ginglymoid articulation ; the articular surfaces entering into its formation being the radius and triangular fibrocartilage above, and the rounded surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone, below ; its ligaments are four in number,— The anterior ligament is a broad and membranous layer consist- ing of three fasciculi, which pass between the lower part of the radius and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone. The posterior ligament, also thin and loose, passes between the l 2 Anterior, Posterior, Internal lateral, External lateral.CARPAL ARTICULATIONS. 148 posterior surface of the radius, and the posterior surface of the semilunar and cuneiform bone. The internal lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform and pisiform bone. The external lateral ligament is attached by one extremity to the styloid process of the radius, and by the other to the side of the scaphoid bone, some of its fibres being prolonged to the trapezium. The radial artery rests on this ligament as it passes backwards to the first metacarpal space. The synovial membrane of the wrist joint lines the under surface of the T*adius and interarticular cartilage above, and the first row of bones of the carpus below. The relations of the wrist joint are, the flexor and exten- of the lateral ligaments of that articulation. 12.

The ligaments are, The dorsal ligaments are ligamentous bands that pass trans- versely and longitudinally from bone to bone oh the dorsal surface of the carpus. The palmar ligaments are fasciculi of the same kind, but stronger than the dorsal, having the like disposition on the palmar surface. The interosseous ligaments are fibrocartilaginous lamellae situated between the adjoining bones in each range : in the upper range they close the upper part of the space between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones ; in the lower range they are stronger than in the Upper, and connect the os magnum on the one side to the unciforme, on the other to the trapezoides, leaving intervals through which the synovial membrane is continued to the bases of the meta- carpal bones. The proper annular ligament (lig. carpi volare proprium) is a firm ligamentous band, which connects the bones of the two sides of the carpus. It is attached by one extremity to the tra- pezium and scaphoid, by the other to the unciform process of the unciforme and base of the pisiform bone, and forms an arch over the anterior surface of the carpus, beneath which the tendons of the long flexors and the median nerve pass into the palm of the hand. The articulation of the pisiform bone with the cuneiform is pro • vided with a separate synovial membrane, protected by fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which form a kind of capsule around the joint; they are inserted into the cuneiforme, unciforme, and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Synovial Membranes.— There are five synovial membranes enter- ing into the composition of the articulations of the carpus :— The first is situated between the lower end of the ulna and the interarticular fibrocartilage ; it is called sacciform, on account of forming a sacculus between the ulna and radius. The second is situated between the lower surface of the radius and interarticular fibrocartilage above, and the first range of bones of the carpus below. The third, the most extensive of the synovial membranes of the wrist, is situated between the two rows of carpal bones, and passes between the bones of the second range, to invest the carpal extre- mities of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers. The fourth is the synovial membrane of the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. The fifth is situated between the pisiform and cuneiform bone. Dorsal, Palmar, Interosseous fibro-cartilages, Annular.150 CARPOMETACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. Actions.—Very little movement exists between the bones in each range, but more is permitted between the two ranges. The motions of the latter, are those of flexion and extension. 9. Carpo-metacarpal Articulations.—The second row of bones of the carpus articulates with the metacarpal bones of the four fingers the index finger, one each from the trapezium and trapezoides ; to the middle finger, one each from the trapezoides and os magnum ; to the ring finger, one each from the os magnum and unciforme ; and to the little finger, one from the unciforme. The palmar ligaments are thin fasciculi arranged according to the same plan on the palmar surface. The synovial membrane is a continuation of the great synovial membrane of the two rows of carpal bones. The capsular ligament of the thumb is one of the three true * Diagram showing the disposition of the five synovial membranes of the wrist joint. 1. Sacciform membrane. 2.

There is also in the carpo-metacarpal articulation a thin in-, terosseous band, which passes from the ulnar edge of the os magnum to the base of the third and fourth metacarpal bones at their point of connexion. The dorsal ligaments are strong fasciculi which pass from the second range of carpal to the metacarpal bones; with the exception of the little finger there are two fasciculi to each bone, namely, to151 METACARPOPHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS. capsular ligaments of the skeleton; the other two being the shoulder and hip. The articulation has a proper synovial membrane. The metacarpal bones of the four fingers are firmly connected at their bases by means of dorsal and palmar ligaments, which extend transversely from one bone to the other, and by interosseous liga- ments which pass between their contiguous surfaces. Their lateral articular facets are lined by a reflection of the great synovial mem- brane of the two rows of carpal bones. Actions.—The movements of the metacarpal on the carpal bones are restricted to a slight degree of sliding motion, with the exception of the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. In the latter, the movements are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. 10. Metacarpophalangeal Articulation.—The metacarpopha- langeal articulation is a ginglymoid joint : and its ligaments four in number,— Anterior, Two lateral, Transverse. The anterior ligaments, thick and fibrocartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joints. They are gx*ooved externally for the lodgment of the flexor tendons, and by their internal aspect form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone. At each side they are continuous with the lateral ligaments. The lateral ligaments are strong narrow fasciculi, holding the bones together at each side. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band passing across the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers, and connected with the anterior ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon over the back of the fingers takes the place, and performs the office of a posterior ligament. Actions.—This articulation admits of movement in four different directions, viz., flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction; it is also capable of circumduction. 11. —Articulation of the Phalanges.—These articulations are ginglymoid joints ; and furnished with three ligaments, Anterior, Two lateral. The anterior ligament, firm and fibro-cartilaginous, forms part of the articular surface for the head of the phalanges ; while exter- nally it is grooved for the reception of the flexor tendons. The lateral ligaments are very strong ; and the principal bond of connexion between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the office of a posterior ligament. Actions.—The movements of the phalangeal joints axe flexion and extension, these movements being more free between the first and second, than between the second and third.152 HIP JOINT. In connexion with the phalanges it will be proper to examine certain fibrous bands termed thecce or vaginal ligaments, which serve to retain the tendons of the flexor muscles against the flat surface of the bones. These fibrous bands are attached at each side to the lateral margins of the phalanges ; they are thick in the interspaces of the joints, thin where the tendons lie upon the joints, and are lined on their inner surface by synovial membrane. LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWEE EXTREMITY. The ligaments of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be arranged in the order of the joints to which they belong; these are, 1. Hip joint. 2. Knee joint. 3. Articulation between the tibia and fibula. 4. Ankle joint. 5. Articulation of the tarsal bones. 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulation. 7. Metatarsophalangeal articulation. 8. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. Hip Joint.—The articulation of the head of the femur with the acetabulum constitutes an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint. The articular surfaces are, the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum and the rounded head of the femur ; the ligaments are jive in num- ber, viz., Capsular, Teres, Ilio-femoral, Cotyloid, Transverse. The capsular ligament (membrana capsularis, fig. 84,'s)is a strong ligamentous capsule, embracing the acetabulum superiorly, the neck of the femur below, and connecting the two bones firmly together. It is much thicker on the upper part of the joint, where more resistance is required, than on the under part, and extends farther along the neck of the femur on the anterior and superior than on the posterior and inferior side, being attached to the inter- trochanteric line in front, to the base of the great trochanter above, and to the middle of the neck of the femur behind. The ilio-femoral ligament (fig. 84, 9) is an accessory and radi- ating band, which descends obliquely from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium to the anterior intertrochanteric line, and strengthens the anterior portion of the capsular ligament. The ligamentum teres (fig. 85, r), triangular in shape, is attached by a round apex to the depression just below the middle of the head of the femur, and by its base, which separates into two fasci- culi, into the borders of the notch of the acetabulum. It is formed153 KNEE JOINT. by a fasciculus of fibres of variable size, surrounded by synovial membrane ; sometimes the synovial membrane is present without tbe fibres, or the ligament is wholly absent. The cotyloid ligament (fig. 85, e) is a prismoid cord of fibrocar- tilage, attached around the margin of the acetabulum, and serving to deepen that cavity and protect its edges. It is thicker at the upper and posterior border of the acetabulum than in front, is in- clined inwards towards the acetabulum, and consists of fibres which arise from the whole circumference of the brim, and interlace with eacE other at acute angles. The transverse ligament is a strong fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the cotyloid ligament, and stretching across the notch of the acetabulum. It converts the notch into a foramen, through which the articular branches of the internal circumflex and obturator artery enter the joint. The fossa at the bottom of the acetabulum is filled with a mass of fat, covered by synovial membrane, which serves as an elastic cushion for the head of the bone during its movements. This was described by Havers as the synovial gland. The synovial membrane is extensive ; it invests the head of the femur, and is continued around the ligamentum teres into the aceta- bulum, whence it is reflected on the inner surface of the capsular ligament back to the head of the bone. The muscles immediately surrounding and in contact with the hip joint'are, in front, psoas and iliacus, separated from the cap- sular ligament by a large synovial bursa ; above, short head of the rectus and gluteus minimus; behind, pyriformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, and quadratus femoris ; and at the inner side, obturator externus and pectineus. Actions.—The movements of the hip joint are very extensive ; they are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. 2. Knee Joint.—The knee is a ginglymoid articulation of large size, and provided with numerous ligaments; the latter are thirteen in number, namely: / Anterior or ligamentum patellae, / Posterior or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, / Internal lateral, I Two external lateral, I Anterior or external crucial, / Posterior or internal crucial, / Transverse, Two coronary, false ligaments. Ligamentum mucosum, Ligamenta alaria, Two semilunar fibro-cartilages, Synovial membrane.KNEE JOINT. 154 Fig. The first five are external to the articulation ; the next five are internal; the remaining three are mere folds of synovial membrane, and have no title to the name of ligaments. In addition to the ligaments, there are two fibrocartilages, and a synovial membrane. The anterior ligament, or Ugamentum patella?, is the prolonga- tion of the tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh downwards to the tubercle of the tibia. It is, therefore, no ligament: and, as the patella is simply a sesamoid bone developed in the tendon of the extensor muscles for the defence of the front of the knee joint, the ligamen- tum patellae has no title to consideration, either as a ligament of the knee joint or as a ligament of the patella. A small bursa mucosa is situated be- tween the ligamentum patella? near its insertion and the front of the tibia ; and another of larger size between the ante- rior surface of the patella and fascia lata. It is the latter which is enlarged in housemaid's knee. The posterior ligament, ligamentum posticum Winslowii, is a broad expansion of ligamentous fibres, which covers the whole of the posterior aspect of the joint. It is divisible into two lateral portions, which invest the condyles of the femur, and a central portion which is depressed, and formed by the interlacement of fas- ciculi passing in different directions. The strongest of these fasciculi is derived from the tendon of the semi- membranosus, and passes obliquely upwards and outwards from the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur. Other accessory fasciculi are given off by the tendon of the popliteus and heads of the gastrocnemius. The middle portion of the ligament supports the popliteal artery and vein, and is perforated by several openings for the passage of branches of the azygos articular artery and the nerves of the joint. The internal lateral ligament is a broad and trapezoid layer of ligamentous fibres, attached above to the tubercle on the internal condyle of the femur, and below to the inner tuberosity of the tibia. It is crossed at its lower part by the tendons of the inner hamstring, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, and it covers in the * Anterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. I.

External lateral ligaments.—The long external lateral ligament is a strong and round cord, which descends from the posterior part of the tubercle on the external condyle of the femur to the outer part of the head of the fibula. The short external lateral ligament is an irregular fasciculus situated be- hind the preceding, arising from the external condyle near the origin of the head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and inserted into the posterior part of the head of the fibula. It is firmly connected with the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and appears princi- pally intended to connect that carti- lage with the fibula ; sometimes it is lost superiorly in the capsular liga- ment without reaching the femur.f The long external lateral ligament is covered in by the tendon of the biceps, and has passing beneath it the tendon of origin of the popliteus muscle, and the inferior external arti- cular artery. The true ligaments within the joint are the crucial, transverse, and coronary. The anterior, or external crucial ligament, arises from the de- pression on the head of the tibia in front of the spinous process, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the inner surface of the outer condyle of the femur, as far back as its posterior border. It is smaller than the posterior. The posterior, or internal crucial ligament, arises from the de- pression on the head of the tibia behind the spinous process, and passes upwards and forwards to be inserted into the inner condyle of the femur. This ligament is less oblique and larger than the anterior. * Posterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. 1.

'156 The transverse ligament is a small slip of fibies which extends transversely from the external semilunar fibrocartilage, near its anterior extremity, to the anterior convexity of the internal car- tilage. The coronary ligaments are the short fibres by which the convex borders of the semilunar cartilages are connected to the head of the tibia and ligaments surrounding the joint. The semilunar fibrocartilages are two falciform plates of fibro- cartilage, situated on the head of the tibia around its margin, and serving to deepen the surface of articulation for the condyles of the femur. They are thick along their convex border; thin and sharp along their concave edge. The internal semilunar fibrocartilage forms an oval cup for the reception of the internal condyle of the femur ; it is connected by its convex border with the head of the Fig.94>* tibia and internal and posterior liga- ments, by means of its coronary liga- ment ; and by its two extremities is firmly implanted into the depression before and behind the spinous process. The external semilunar fibrocartilage bounds a circular fossa for the external condyle ; it is connected by its convex border with the head of the tibia, and to the external and posterior ligaments by its coronary ligament; by its two extremities it is inserted into the de- pression between the two projections which constitute the spinous process of the tibia. The two extremities of the external cartilage being inserted into the same fossa, form an almost complete circle, and the cartilage being somewhat broader than the internal, nearly covers the articular surface of the tibia. The external semilunar fibrocartilage, besides giving off a fasci- culus from its anterior border to constitute the transverse ligament, is continuous by some of its fibres with the extremity of the anterior * The right knee joint laid open from the front, in order to show the in- ternal ligaments. 1.

The ligamentum mucosum is a slender conical process of synovial membrane enclosing a few ligamentous fibres which proceed from the transverse ligament. It is connected, by its apex, with the an- terior part of the condyloid notch, and, by its base, is lost in the mass of fat which projects into the joint beneath the patella. The alar ligaments are two fringed folds of synovial membrane, extending from the ligamentum mucosum, along the edges of the mass of fat to the sides of the patella. The synovial membrane of the knee joint is by far the most ex- tensive in the body. It invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the condyles of the femur, head of tibia, and inner surface of the patella;, it covers both suifaces of the semilunar fibrocartilages ; and is reflected upon the crucial ligaments, and inner surface of the ligaments which form the circum- * Longitudinal section of the left knee joint, showing the reflections of its synovial membrane. 1.

It may be traced from the sacculus (at 8), along the inner surface of the patella; then over the adipose mass (7) from which it throws off the mucous ligament (10); then over the head of the tibia, forming a sheath to the crucial ligaments; then upwards along the posterior ligament and condyles of the femur, to the sacculus whence its examination com- menced.158 TIBIOFIBULAR ARTICULATION. ference of the joint. On each side of the patella it lines the ten- dinous aponeuroses of the vastus internus and vastus externus muscle, and forms a pouch of considerable size between the extensor tendon and front of the femur. It also forms the folds in the in- terior of the joint, called "ligamentum mucosum," and "ligamenta alaria." The superior pouch of the synovial membrane is sup- ported and. raised during the movements of the limb by a small muscle, the subcrureus, which is inserted into it. Between the ligamentum patellae and synovial membrane is a considerable mass of fat, which presses the membrane towards the interior of the joint, and occupies the fossa between the condyles. Besides the proper ligaments of the articulation, the joint is strengthened in front by the fascia lata, which is thicker at the outer than the inner side, by a tendinous expansion from the vastus internus, and some scattered ligamentous fibres inserted into the sides of the patella. This expansion has been termed the capsular Actions.—The knee joint is one of the strongest of the articula- tions of the body, while, at the same time, it admits of the most perfect degree of movement in the direction of flexion and extension. During flexion the articular surface of the tibia glides forward on • the condyles of the femur ; the lateral ligaments, the posterior, and the crucial ligaments are relaxed ; while the ligamentum patellae, being on the stretch, serves to press the adipose mass behind it into the vacuity formed in the front of the joint. In extension all the ligaments are put on the stretch, with the exception of the liga- mentum patellae. When the knee is semi-flexed, a partial degree of rotation is permitted. 3. Articulation between the Tibia and Fibula.—The tibia and fibula are held firmly connected by means of seven ligaments, namely, Anterior, ) , Anterior, ) , , Posterior, j above' Posterior, j helow' Interosseous membrane, m t , . p . ' Transverse. Interosseous interior, The anterior superior tibio fibular ligament is a strong fasciculus of parallel fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to the anterior surface of the head of the fibula. The posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, thicker and stronger than the anterior, is disposed in a similar manner on the posterior surface of the joint. Within the articulation there is a synovial membrane which is sometimes continuous with that of the knee joint. The interosseous membrane, or superior interosseous ligament, is a broad, layer of aponeurotic fibres which pass obliquely downwards and outwards, from the sharp ridge on the tibia to the inner edge159 ANKLE JOINT. of the fibula, and are crossed at an acute angle by a few fibres taking the opposite direction. The ligament is deficient above, leaving a considerable interval between the bones, through which the anterior tibial artery takes its course forward to the anterior aspect of the leg; and perforated belovj, near its lower third, for the anterior peroneal artery and vein. The interosseous membrane is in relation, in front, with the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, anterior tibial vessels and nerve, and anterior peroneal artery; behind, with the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and posterior peroneal artery. The inferior interosseous ligament consists of short and strong fibres, which hold the bones firmly together inferiorly, where they are nearly in contact. This articulation is so firm, that the fibula is broken when an attempt is made to rupture the ligament. The anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament is a broad band, con- sisting of two fasciculi of parallel fibres which pass obliquely across the anterior aspect of the articulation of the two bones at their in- ferior extremity, from tibia to fibula. The posterior inferior tibio-fibidar liga- Fig. 96.* ment is a similar band on the posterior sur- face of the articulation. Both ligaments project somewhat below the margin of the bones, and serve to deepen the cavity of arti- culation with the astragalus. The transverse ligament is a narrow band of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the preceding, and passing transversely across the back of the ankle joint between the two malleoli. The synovial membrane of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation, is a duplicature of the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, reflected upwards for a short distance be- tween the two bones. Actions.—Between the tibia and fibula there exists a slight degree of movement, which is calculated to enable the latter to resist injury by yielding for a trifling extent to forcible pressure. 4. Ankle Joint.—The ankle is a ginglymoid articulation ; the surfaces entering into its formation are the under surface of the tibia with its malleolus and the malleolus of the fibula, above ; and * Posterior view of the ankle joint. 1.

The ligaments are three in number : Anterior, Internal lateral, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a thin, membranous layer, passing from the margin of the tibia, to the astragalus, in front of its articular surface. It is in relation, in front, with the tendons of the ex- tensors of the great and lesser toes, tibialis anticus, peroneus tertius, and anterior tibial vessels and Fig. 97.* nerves. Posteriorly it lies in con- tact with a stratum of extra- synovial adipose tissue and the synovial membrane. The internal lateral or del- toid ligament is a triangular layer of fibres, attached supe- riorly, by its apex, to the internal malleolus ; inferiorly, by an ex- ^-^f * WtJPfP^s^^! Panded t>ase» to tne astragalus, -C *TV£ 1 Sal^^rli os calcis, and scaphoid bone. Be- neath the superficial layer of this ligament is a stronger and thicker fasciculus, which connects the apex of the internal malleolus with the side of the astragalus. The internal lateral ligament is covered in and partly concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, and, at its posterior part, is in relation with the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus pollicis. The external lateral ligament consists of three strong fasciculi, which proceed from the inner side of the external malleolus, and radiate in three different directions. The anterior fasciculus passes forward, to be attached to the astragalus ; \he posterior, backward, to be connected with the astragalus posteriorly ; and the middle, longer than the other two, descends to be inserted into the outer side of the os calcis. "It is the strong union of this bone," says Sir Astley Cooper, with the tarsal bones, by means of the external lateral ligaments, "which leads to its being more frequently fractured than dislo- cated." The transverse ligament of the tibia and fibula occupies the place of a posterior ligament of the ankle joint. It is in relation, behind, with the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and tendon of the tibialis * Internal view of the ankle joint. 1. Internal malleolus of the tibia. 2 2. Astragalus. 3.

The synovial membrane invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the tibia and fibula (sending a duplicature upwards between their lower ends), and the upper surface and two sides of the astragajus. It is then reflected upon the anterior and lateral ligaments, and on the transverse ligament posteriorly. Actions. —The movements of the ankle joint are flexion and ex- tension only, without lateral motion. 5. Articulation of the Tarsal Bones.—The ligaments which con- nect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds,— Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are small fasciculi of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it articulates. The only dorsal liga- ments deserving of particular men- Fl9' 98-* tion, are the external and poste- rior calcaneo-astragaloid, which, with the interosseous ligament, complete the articulation of the astragalus with the os calcis ; the superior and internal calcaneo- cuboid ligaments; and the supe- rior astragalo-scaphoid ligament. The internal calcaneo-cuboid, and superior calcaneo-scaphoid liga- ment, which are closely united posteriorly in the deep groove which intervenes between the as- tragalus and os calcis, separate anteriorly to reach their respective bones ; they form the principal bond of connexion between the first and second range of bones of the foot. It is the division of this portion of these ligaments that demands the careful attention of the surgeon in performing Chopart's operation. The plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar surface of the foot; three of them, however, are of large size, and have especial names, viz., the Calcaneo-scaphoid, Long calcaneo-cuboid, Short calcaneo-cuboid. * External view of the ankle joint. 1.

MTARSAL ARTICULATIONS. 162 The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament is a broad and fibrocar- tilaginous band of ligament, which passes forward from the anterior and inner border of the os calcis to the edge of the scaphoid bone. Besides connecting the os calcis and sca- Fy. 99.* phoid, it supports the astragalus, and forms part of the cavity in which the rounded head of the latter bone is re- ceived. It is lined on its upper surface by the synovial membrane of the astra- galo-scaphoid articulation. The firm connexion of the os calcis with the scaphoid bone, and the feebleness of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, are conditions favourable to the occasional dislocation of the head of the astragalus. The long calcaneo-cuboid, or liga- mentum longum plantce, is a long band of ligamentous fibres, which proceeds from the under surface of the os calcis to the rough surface on the under part of the cuboid bone, its fibres being continued onwards to the base of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. _u This ligament forms the inferior boun- dary of a canal in the cuboid bone, through which the tendon of the peroneus longus passes to its insertion into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The short calcaneo-cuboid, or liga- mentum breve plantos, is situated closer to the bones than the long plantar ligament, from which it is separated by adipose tissue ; it is broad and exten- sive, and ties the under part of the os calcis and cuboid bone firmly together. The interosseous ligaments are five in number ; they are short and strong ligamentous fibres situated between adjoining bones, and firmly attached to their rough surfaces. One of these, calca- neo-astragaloid, is lodged in the groove between the upper surface of the os calcis and the lower of the astragalus. It is large and very strong, consists of vertical and oblique fibres, and serves to * Ligaments of the sole of the foot. 1. Os calcis. 2. Astragalus. 3. Tube- rosity of the scaphoid bone. 4.

The second interosseous ligament, also very strong, is situated between the sides of the scaphoid and cuboid bone ; the three remaining interosseous ligaments connect strongly together the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid. The synovial membranes of the tarsus are four in number; one, for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; a second, for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulation ; occasionally an additional small synovial membrane is found in the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint; a third, for the calcaneo-cuboid articulation ; and a fourth, the large tarsal synovial membrane for the articulations between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones, the cuneiform bones with each other, the external cuneiform bone with the cuboid, and the two external cuneiform bones with the • bases of the second and third metatarsal bones. The prolongation which reaches the metatarsal bones passes forward between the in- ternal and middle cuneiform bone. A small synovial membrane is sometimes met with between the contiguous surfaces of the sca- phoid and cuboid bone. Actions.—The movements permitted by the articulation between the astragalus and os calcis, are a slight degree of gliding, in the direction forwards and backwards, and laterally from side to side. The movements of the second range of tarsal bones are very trifling, being greater between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones than in the other articulations. The movements occurring between the first and second range are the most considerable ; they are adduc- tion and abduction; and, in a minor degree, flexion, which in- creases the arch of the foot, and extension, which flattens the arch. 6. Tarso-metatarsal Articulation. —The ligaments of this arti- culation are, Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments connect the metatarsal to the tarsal bones, and the metatarsal bones with each other. The base of the second metatarsal bone, articulating with the three cuneiform bones, re- ceives a ligamentous slip from each, while the rest articulating with a single tarsal bone receive only a single tarsal slip. The -plantar ligaments have a similar disposition on the plantar surface. The interosseous ligaments are situated between the bases of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes; also between the base of the second and third metatarsal bone and the internal and external cuneiform bone. The metatarsal bone of the second toe being implanted by its base between the internal and external cuneiform bone, is the most strongly articulated of all the metatarsal bones. This disposition m 2164 AKTIC UL ATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. must be recollected in amputation at the tarso-metatarsal articula- tion. The synovial membranes of the tarso-metatarsal articulation are three in number : one for the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; one for the second and third metatarsal bone, which is continuous with the great tarsal synovial membrane; and one for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Actions.—The movements of the metatarsal on the tarsal bones and on each other are very slight; they are such only as contribute to the strength of the foot, by permitting a certain degree of yield- ing to opposing forces. 7. Metatarsophalangeal Articulation.—The ligaments of this articulation, like those between the first phalanges and metacarpal bones of the hand, are, Inferior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The inferior or plantar ligaments, thick and fibrocartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joint. The lateral ligaments, short and very strong, are situated one on each side of the joint. The transverse ligament is a strong band, which passes trans- versely between the plantar ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions.—The movements of the first phalanges on the rounded heads of the metatarsal bones, are flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction. 8. Articulation of the Phalanges.—The ligaments of the pha- langes are the same as those of the fingers, and have the same dis- position ; their actions are also similar. They are, Inferior or plantar, and, Two lateral.165 CHAPTER III. OF THE MUSCLES. Muscles are the moving organs of the animal frame ; they con- stitute by their size and number the great bulk of the body, upon which they bestow form and symmetry. In the limbs they are situated around the bones, which they invest and defend, while they form "to some of the joints a principal protection. In the trunk they are spread out to enclose cavities and constitute a defensive wall, capable of yielding to internal pressure, and again returning to its original position. Their colour presents the deep red which is characteristic of flesh, and their form is variously modified, to execute the varied range of movements which they are required to effect. Muscle is composed of a number of parallel fibres placed side by side, and supported and held together by a delicate web of areolar tissue; so that, if it were possible to remove the muscular substance, we should have remaining a beautiful reticular framework, possess- ing the exact form and size of the muscle without its colour and solidity. Towards the extremity of the organ the muscular fibre ceases, and the fibrous structure becomes aggregated and modified, so as to constitute those glistening fibres and cords by which the muscle is tied to the surface of bone, and which are called tendons. Almost every muscle of the body is connected with bone, either by tendinous fibres, or by an aggregation of those fibres constituting a tendon ; and the union is so firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone itself breaks rather than permit the separation of the tendon from its attachment. In the broad muscle the tendon is spread out so as to form an expansion, called aponeurosis (awb, longe ; vevpov* nervus, a nerve widely spread out). Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement of their fibres in relation to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are longitudinal, and terminate at each extremity in tendon, the entire muscle being fusiform in shape ; in other situations they are dis- posed like the rays of a fan, converging to a tendinous point, as the temporal, pectoral, glutei, &c, and constitute a radiate muscle. Again, they are penniform, converging like the barbs of a feather to one side of a tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle, as in the peronei; or bipenniform, converging to both sides of the tendon. In other muscles the fibres pass obliquely from the sur- * The ancients named all the white fibres of the body vevpd: the term has since been limited to the nerves.STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. 166 face of a tendinous expansion spread out on one side, to that of an- other extended on the opposite side, as in the semi-membranosus; or, they are composed of penniform or bipenniform fasciculi, as in the deltoid, and constitute a compound muscle. The nomenclature of muscles is defective and confused, and is generally derived from some prominent character which the muscle presents; thus, some are named from their situation, as the tibialis, peroneus, brachialis, temporalis; others from their use, as the flexors, extensors, adductors, abductors, levators, tensors, sphinc- ters, &c. Some again from their form, as the trapezius, triangu- laris, deltoid, rhomboideus, scalenus, orbicularis, &c.; and others from their direction, as the rectus, obliquus, transversalis, &c. Certain muscles have received names expressive of their attachments, as the sterno-mastoideus, sterno-hyoideus, &c. ; and others, of their divisions, as the biceps, triceps, digastricus, complexus, &c. In the description of a muscle we express its attachment by the words " origin" and "insertion" : the term origin is generally ap- plied to the more fixed or central attachment, or to the point towards which the motion is directed, while insertion is assigned to the more moveable point, or to that most distant from the centre ; but there are exceptions to this principle, and as many muscles pull equally towards both extremities, the use of such terms must be regarded as arbitrary. In structure, muscle is composed of bundles of fibres of variable size called fasciculi, which are enclosed in an areolar membranous investment or sheath, and the latter is continuous with Fig. 100* the areolar framework of the fibres. Each fasciculus is composed of a number of smaller bundles, and these of single fibres, which, from their minute size and inde- pendent appearance, have been distinguished by the name of ultimate fibres. The ultimate fibre is found by microscopic investigation to be itself a fasciculus (ulti- mate fasciculus), made up of a number of ultimate fibrils enclosed in a delicate sheath, the myolemma or sarco- lemma.f Two kinds of ultimate muscular fibre exist in the animal economy; viz., that of voluntary or animal life, striated muscle; and that of involuntary or organic life, smooth muscle. * A muscular fibre of animal life enclosed in its myolemma; the transverse and longitudinal striae are seen. t In the summer of 1836, while engaged with Dr. Jones Quain in the ex- amination of animal tissues with a simple dissecting microscope, constructed by Powell, I first saw that the ultimate fibre of muscle was invested by a proper sheath, for which I proposed the term " Myolemmaa term which was adopted by Dr. Quain in the fourth edition of his " Elements of Anatomy." We at that time believed that the transverse folding of that sheath gave rise to the appearance of transverse striae, an opinion which subsequent examina- tions proved to be incorrect. Mr. Bowman has since employed the term " Sarcolemma," as synonymous with Myolemma.167 STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. The ultimate fibre of animal life is known by its size, by its uniformity of calibre, and especially by the transverse markings which occur at minute and regular distances. It also presents other markings or striae, having a longitudinal direction, which in- dicate the existence of fibrillar within the myolemma. The myo- lemma, or sarcolemma, the investing sheath of the ultimate fibre, is thin, homogeneous, transparent, and elastic. According to Bowman, * the ultimate fibres or fasciculi are polyhedral in shape and various in size; the polyhedral form be- ing due to mutual pressure, and the variety of size, besides being met with in a single muscle, being also characteristic of dif- ferent classes, genera, and even sexes of animals : thus the ave- rage diameter of the ultimate fibre in the human female is in the male -gi^-, the average of both being in round numbers The largest fibres are met with in fishes, in which they average ; the next largest are found in man ; while in other classes they range in the follow- ing order :—insects T±rw; reptiles -^r J mammalia -g^T ; birds ^y. The Ultimate fibrils of animal life, according to Bowman, are beaded filaments presenting a Fig. 1024 regular succession of segments and constrictions, the latter being narrower than the former, and the component substance probably less dense. An ultimate fibre consists of a bundle of these fibrils, which are so disposed that all the seg- ments and all the constrictions correspond, and in this manner give rise to the alternate light and dark lines of the transverse striae. The fibrils are connected together with very different degrees of closeness in different animals; in man they are but slightly adherent, and dis- tinct longitudinal lines of junction may be ob- served between them ; they also separate easily when macerated for some time.

Generally, in a recent fasciculus, there are transverse striae, showing divisions into disks, and longitudinal striae, marking its composition by fibrillae." Bowman has observed that in the substance of the ultimate fibre there exist minute '1 oval or circular disks, frequently concave on one or both surfaces, and containing, somewhere near the centre, one, two, or three minute dots or their number, relatively to the bulk of the fasciculi, at these two epochs, remains nearly the same," Bowman believes that, " during development, and subsequently, a further and successive deposit of corpuscles " takes place. The corpuscles are bi'ought into view only when the muscular fibre is acted upon by a solution of "one of the milder acids, as the citric." * Ultimate fibre, in which the transverse splitting into disks, in the direction of the constrictions of the ultimate fibrils, is seen.

"In fact," says Bowman, "the primitive fas- ciculus seems to consist of primi- tive component segments or par- ticles, arranged so as to form, in one sense, fibrillae, and in another sense, disks: and which of these two may happen to present itself to the observer, will depend on the Fig. 104.t granules." Occasionally they pre- sent irregularities of form, which he regards as accidental. They are situated between and connected with the fibrils, and distributed in pretty equal numbers through the fibre. These corpuscles are the nuclei of the nucleated cells out of which the muscular fibre was originally developed. Observ- ing, however, that their "abso- lute number is far greater in the adult than in the foetus, while169 STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. Fig. 105.t According to my investigations,* the ultimate fibril of animal life is cylindrical when isolated, and probably polyhedral from pressure when forming part of an ultimate fibre or fasciculus. It measures in diameter 20q06 of an inch, and is composed of a succession of cells con- nected by their fiat surfaces. The cells are filled with a transparent substance, which may be termed myoline. The myoline differs in density in different cells, and from this circumstance be- stows a peculiarity of character on cer- tain of the cells. For example, when a fibril in its passive state is examined, there will be seen a series of dark ob- long bodies separated by light spaces of equal length; now, the dark bodies are each composed of a pair of cells containing the densest form of myoline, and are hence highly refractive, while the transparent spaces are constituted by a pair of cells containing a more fluid myoline. When the fibrils are collected together so as to form an ultimate fibre or fasciculus, the appearance of the cell is altered: those which look dark in the single fibril, that is, the most refractive, being ranged side by side, con- stitute the bright band ; while the transparent cells of the single fibril are the shaded strise of the fibre. When the ultimate fibril is very much stretched, the two highly refractive cells appear .each to be double; while the transparent space is evidently composed of four cells. The ultimate fibre of organic life, or smooth muscular fibre, is a simple homogeneous filament much smaller than the fibre of animal life, flat, smooth, and without transverse markings.

These fibres were originally round nucleated cells, which have become elongated into a fusiform shape, and sub- sequently grown into the dimensions of fibres. When of small size they have a single nucleus ; but in the longer fibre a succession of nuclei with corresponding swollen parts may be observed from point to point, and the nucleus is sometimes so much elongated as to de- serve the title of columnar. The fusiform cells are united into little bundles or fasciculi by an adhesive interstitial substance, and the fasciculi, which are sometimes round and sometimes flat, are bound together into larger bundles by areolar tissue and fine elastic fibres; the interspaces of the bundles being occupied by vessels and nerves, the former in great abundance. Organic or smooth muscle is distributed abundantly in the animal frame, and is met with in all situations where a distinct contractile power, independent of mere elasticity, is required ; for example, in the alimentary canal, from the middle of the oesophagus to the in- ternal sphincter ani; in the posterior segment of the trachea, and in the bronchial tubes to their finest ramifications ; in the excretory ducts of various glands, as Wharton's duct, the ductus communis choledochus, the calices and pelvis of the kidneys; the ureters, bladder, and urethra ; on the testes, around the vasa deferentia and vesicula3 seminales, the prostate, Cowper's glands, and in the sub- stance of the corpora cavernosa ; in the Fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina ; in the middle coat of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels; in the iris ; and in the corium of the skin, particularly in the areola and nipples of the mammary glands, in the dartos of the scrotum, and around the hair follicles, and many of the sudoriferous and sebiferous ducts. The development of muscular fibre is effected by means of the formation of nucleated cells out of an original blastema, and -the con- version of those cells into the tubuli of ulti- mate fibres, while their contents, by a subse- quent developmental action, are transformed into ultimate fibrils. In the muscular fibre of organic life the process seems to stop short of the formation of fibrillas ; the cell-contents re- taining their original homogeneous or granular character. Muscles are divided into two great classes, voluntary and involuntary, to which may be added, as an intermediate and connecting link, the muscle of the vascular system, the heart. * d.

The voluntary, or system of animal life, is developed from the external or serous layer of the germinal membrane, and comprehends the whole of the muscles of the limbs and trunk. The involuntary, or organic system, is developed from the internal or mucous layer, and constitutes the thin muscular structure of the intestinal canal, urinary passages, and internal organs of generation. Near the com- mencement of the alimentary canal at the middle of the oesophagus, and near its termination at the anus, the muscular coat is formed by a blending of the fibres of both classes. The heart is developed from the middle, or vascular layer of the germinal membrane ; and although involuntary in its action is composed of ultimate fibres, having the transverse striae of the muscle of animal life. Striated muscle is also found around the venae cavse near the heart, in the upper half of the oesophagus, and in the round ligaments of the uterus. The muscles may be arranged in conformity with the general division of the body into—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. The muscles of the head and neck admit of subdivision into those of the head and face and those of the neck. Muscles of the Head and Face.—These muscles may be divided into groups corresponding with the natural regions of the head and face ; the groups are eight in number, namely, 1. Cranial group. 5. Superior labial group. 2. Orbital group. 6. Inferior labial group. The muscles of each of these groups may be thus arranged— MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 3. Ocular group. 4. Nasal group. 7.

Dissection.—The occipito-frontalis is to be dissected by making a longitudinal incision along the vertex of the head, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the root of the nose ; and a second incision along the forehead and around the side of the head, to join the two extremities of the preceding. Dissect the integument and superficial fascia carefully outwards, beginning at the anterior angle of the flap, where the muscular fibres are thickest, and remove it altogether. This dissection requires care ; for the muscle is very thin, and without attention would be raised with the integument. There is no deep fascia on the face or head, nor is it required ; for here the muscles are closely applied against the bones, upon which they depend for support, whilst in the extremities the sup- port is derived from the dense layer of fascia by which they are invested, and which forms for each muscle a distinct sheath. The Occipito-frontalis (epicranius) is a broad musculo-apbneu- rotic layer, which covers the whole side of the vertex of the skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It arises by tendinous fibres from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Its insertion takes place by means of the blending of the fibres of its anterior portion with those of the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and pyramidalis nasi. The muscle is fleshy in front over the frontal bone (frontalis) and behind over the occipital (occipitalis), the two portions being connected by a broad aponeurosis. The two muscles, together with their apo- neurosis, cover the whole vertex of the skull, hence their designation galea capitis ; they are loosely adherent to the pericranium, but closely to the integument, particularly on the forehead. At the sides of the head the aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) is attached to the root of the mastoid process and processus auditorius, and, becoming thin over the temporal fascia, is connected with the zygoma, malar bone, and external boundary of the orbit.

Lastly, divide the integument in front of the external ear upwards to the transverse incision which was made for exposing the occipito-frontalis. Dissect the integu- ment and superficial fascia carefully from the whole of the region included by these incisions, and the present and two following' groups of muscles will be brought into view. The Orbicularis palpebrarum is a sphincter muscle, surround- ing the orbit and eyelids, and consists of two portions, external and internal. The external or orbital portion arises from a short tendon, tendo palpebrarum (tendo oculi), situated at the inner angle of the eye, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary and angular process of the frontal bone ; it encircles the orbit, and is inserted into the inner border of the orbit and lower border of the tendo palpebrarum, some of its fibres being continuous with the upper segment. The. internal portion (palpebralis) forms a curved plane of fibres on the eyelids, thinner and paler than the orbital portion ; externally these fibres are attached to the external palpebral ligament and border of the orbit, some being continuous with the orbital portion ; internally they are attached to the borders of the lacus lachrymalis and tendo palpebrarum. The borders of the palpebralis nearest the edges of the lids are thicker than the rest, and termed ciliaris. . Mr. Haynes Walton* remarks that the ciliaris is redder than the rest of the palpebralis, and continuous with the tensor tarsi; he conceives it to be the active cause in the production of entropium. The tendo palpebrarum (tendo oculi), about two lines in length and one in breadth, is attached by one end to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, close to the edge of the orbit; the other end bifurcates to be inserted into the inner extremities of the tarsal cartilages ; from its inner side is given off a process which spreads over the lachrymal sac, and is attached to the crest of the lachrymal bone ; this is the reflected aponeurosis of the tendo palpebrarum, and serves to protect the lachrymal sac. Relations.—By its superficial surf ace it is closely adherent to the integument, from which it is separated on the eyelids by a loose cellular tissue. By its deep surface it lies in contact, above, with the upper border of the orbit, corrugator supercilii muscle, frontal and supraorbital vessels, and supraorbital nerve ; below, with the lachrymal sac, levator labii superioris alaaque nasi, levator labii superioris proprius, zygomaticus major and minor muscles, and malar bone ; externally, with the temporal fascia. On the eyelids tendon is seen passing through its aponeurotic pulley. 23. Stylo-hyoid muscle • pierced by the posterior belly of the digastricus. 24. Mylo-hyoideus. 25.

The Corrugator SUPBRCILII is a small, narrow, and pointed muscle, situated immediately above the orbit and beneath the upper segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum. It arises from the inner extremity of the superciliary ridge, and is inserted into the under surface of the orbicularis palpebrarum. Its connexion with the orbicularis commences near the supraorbital foramen and is con- tinued outwards to the external angular process. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the pyramidalis nasi, occipito-frontalis and orbicularis palpebrarum ; by its deep surface, with the supraorbital vessels and nerve. The Tensor tarsi (Horner's* muscle) is a thin plane of muscular fibres, about three lines in breadth and six in length. It is best dissected by separating the eyelids from the eye, and turning them over the nose without disturbing the tendo palpebrarum oculi; then dissect away the small fold of mucous membrane called plica semi- lunaris, and some loose cellular tissue under which the muscle is concealed. It arises from the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac, divides into two slips, which are continuous with the margin of the ciliaris along the edges of the lids ;+ some few of its fibres being attached to the lachrymal canals as far ap the puncta. According to some anatomists the tensor tarsi is a process of the orbicularis consisting of two small fasciculi which enclose the lachrymal canals, and then spread out on the aponeurosis of the lachrymal sac to be inserted into the crest and orbital surface of the lachrymal bone. Actions.—The palpebral portion of the orbicularis acts involun- tarily in closing the lids, and from the greater curve of the upper lid, upon that principally. The entire muscle constitutes a sphincter, drawing at the same time, by means of its osseous attachment, the integument and lids inwards towards the nose. The corrugatores superciliorum draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards, and produce the vei'tical wrinkles of the forehead. The tensor tarsi, or lachrymal muscle, is an auxiliary to the orbicularis, and draws the extremities of the lachrymal canals inwards, so as to place the puncta in the best position for receiving the tears. It serves also to keep the lids in relation with the surface of the eye. Dr. Horner is acquainted with two persons who have the voluntary power of drawing the lids inwards by these muscles so as to bury the puncta in the angle of the eye. 3.

Dissection.—To open the orbit (the calvarium and brain having been removed) the frontal bone must be sawn through at the inner extremity of the orbital ridge; and, externally, at its outer ex- tremity. The roof of the orbit may then be comminuted with the hammer ; a process easily accomplished, on account of the thinness of the orbital plate of the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid. The superciliary portion of the orbit may next be driven forwards by a smart blow, and the external angular process and external wall of the orbit outwards in the same manner ; the broken fragments of the roof of the orbit should then be removed. By this means the periosteum will be exposed unbroken and undisturbed. Remove the periosteum from the whole of the upper surface of the exposed orbit, and examine the parts beneath. The Levator palpebr^e is a long, thin, and triangular muscle, situated in the upper part of the orbit on the middle line ; it arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve ; and is inserted into the upper border of the superior tarsal cartilage. Relations.—By its upper surface with the fourth nerve, supra- orbital nerve and artery, periosteum of the orbit, and, in front, inner face of the broad tarsal ligament. By its under surface it rests on the superior rectus, globe of the eye, and conjunctiva ; it receives its nerve and artery by this aspect. The Rectus superior (attollens) arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; and is inserted into the upper surface of the globe of the eye at a point somewhat more than three lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its upper surface with the levator palpebrse muscle ; by the under surface with the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery and nasal nerve, from which it is separated by the adipose tissue of the orbit, and, in front, with the globe of the eye, the tendon of the superior oblique muscle being interposed. The Rectus inferior (depressor) arises from the inferior margin of the optic foramen by a tendon (ligament of Zinn) which is com- mon to it and the internal and external rectus, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve ; it is inserted into the inferior surface of the globe of the eye, a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its upper surface with the optic nerve, inferior oblique branch of the third nerve, adipose tissue of the orbit, and under surface of the globe of the eye. By its under surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orbit, and inferior oblique muscle. The Rectus internus (adductor); the thickest and shortest of the straight muscles, arises from the common tendon, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve ; and is inserted into the inner surface of the globe of the eye at two lines from the margin of the cornea.OCULAR GROUP. 177 Relations.—By its internal surface with the optic nerve, adipose tissue of the orbit, and eyeball. By its outer surface with the Fig. 108.* periosteum of the orbit; by its upper border with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal vessels, nasal and infra-trochlear nerve. The Rectus externus (abductor), the longest of the straight muscles, arises by two heads, one from the common tendon, the other with the origin of the superior rectus from the margin of the optic foramen ; the nasal, third, and sixth nerve, passing between them. It is inserted into the outer surface of the globe of the eye, a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its internal surface with the third, nasal, sixth, and optic nerve, ciliary ganglion and nerves, ophthalmic artery and vein, adipose tissue of the orbit, inferior oblique muscle, and eye- ball. By its external surface with the periosteum of the orbit and lachrymal gland ; by the upper border with the lachrymal vessels and nerve. The recti muscles present several characters in common; thus, they are thin, have each the form of an isosceles triangle, bear the same relation to the globe of the eye, and are inserted in a similar manner into the sclerotica, at about two lines from the circum- ference of the cornea. The points of difference relate to thickness and length ; the internal rectus is the thickest and shortest, the external the longest, and the superior the most thin. The insertion of the four recti into the globe of the eye forms a tendinous expan- sion, which is continued as far as the margin of the cornea, and is termed tunica albuginea. * Muscles of the eyeball; the view is taken from the outer side of the right orbit. 1.

NMUSCLES OF THE FACE. 178 The Obliqttus superior (trochlearis) is a fusiform muscle arising from the margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve ; it passes forward to the pulley at the internal angular process of the frontal bone ; its tendon is then reflected outwards beneath the superior rectus to the outer part of the globe of the eye, where it is inserted into the sclerotic coat, at about midway between the margin of the cornea and the optic nerve. The trochlea or pulley of the superior oblique muscle is a fibro- cartilaginous ring attached to the depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone. The ring is flat, about a line in width, and provided with a synovial membrane, which is con- tinued, together with a fibrous sheath, for a short distance, upon the tendon. Sometimes the ring is supported, or in part formed, by a process of bone. Relations.—By its superior surface with the fourth nerve, supra-trochlear nerve, and periosteum of the orbit. By the infe- rior surface with the adipose tissue of the orbit, upper border of the internal rectus, and the vessels and nerves crossing that border. The Obliquus inferior, a thin and narrow muscle, arises from the inner margin of the superior maxillary bone, immediately external to the lachrymal groove, and passes beneath the inferior rectus, to be inserted into the outer and posterior part of the eye- ball, at about two lines from the entrance of the optic nerve. Relations.—By its superior surface with the inferior rectus muscle and eyeball; by the inferior surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orbit, and external rectus. According to Ferrall*" the muscles of the orbit are separated from the globe of the eyeball and structures immediately surround- ing- the optic nerve, by a fascia, which is continuous with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal cartilages. This fascia the author terms tunica vaginalis oculi ;f it is pierced anteriorly, for the passage of the six orbital muscles, by six openings, through which the tendons of the muscles play as through pulleys. The use assigned to it by Ferrall is to protect the eyeball from the pressure of its muscles during their action ; by its means, also, the recti muscles are enabled to give a rotatory movement to the eyeball; and in brutes antagonize the retractor muscle. Actions.—The levator palpebral raises the upper eyelid. The four recti, acting singly, pull the eyeball in the four directions ; upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards. Acting by pairs, they carry the eyeball in the diagonal of these directions, viz., upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and inwards, downwards and outwards. Acting all together, they directly retract the globe within the orbit. The superior oblique muscle, acting alone, rolls the globe inwards and forwards, and carries the pupil outwards and downwards to the lower and outer * In a paper read before the Koyal Society, on the 10th of June, 1841. t First described by Dalrymple, " Anatomy of the Human Eye." 1834.179 NASAL GROUP. angle of the orbit. The inferior oblique acting alone, rolls the globe outwards and backwards, and carries the pupil outwards and upwards to the upper and outer angle of the eye. Both muscles acting together, draw the eyeball forward, and give the pupil that slight degree of eversion which enables it to admit the largest field of vision. 4. Nasal Group.— Pyramidalis nasi, naris, Dilatator naris, se nasi. The Pyramidalis nasi (procerus) is a small pyramidal slip of muscular fibres sent downwards on the bridge of the nose by the Fig. 109.: occipito-frontalis. It is serted into the tendinous expansion of the compressor naris. Relations.—By its upper surface with the integument; by its under surface with the periosteum of the frontal and nasal bone. Its outer border corresponds with the edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum ; its innir border with its fel- low, from which it is separated by a narrow cellular space. The Compressor naris (transversus nasi) is a thin and triangular muscle; it arises by its apex from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and spreads out upon the side of the nose into a thin tendinous expan- sion, which is continuous across the ridge with the muscle of the opposite side. It is connected at its origin with a muscular fasciculus which is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxil- * Muscles of the nose; after Arnold. 1. Pyramidalis nasi. 2.

This muscular slip was termed by Albinus, musculus anomalus, from its attachment to bone by both ends; and by Santorinus, musculus rhomboideus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator labii superioris proprius, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and integu- ment ; by its deep surface with the superior maxillary and nasal bone, and with the alar and lateral cartilage of the nose. The Dilatator naris is a thin and indistinct muscular apparatus expanded on the ala of the nostril, and consisting of an anterior and posterior slip. The anterior slip (levator proprius alas nasi anterior) arises from the upper border and surface of the alar carti- lage, and is inserted into the integument of the border of the nos- tril. The posterior slip (levator proprius alee nasi posterior) arises from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and sesamoid cartilages, and is inserted into the integument of the border of the nostril, its posterior half. These muscles are difficult of dissection, from the close adhesion of the integument with the nasal cartilages. The Depressor aj^m nasi (myrtiformis) is brought into view by drawing upwards the upper lip and raising the mucous membrane. It arises from the superior maxillary bone in front of the roots of the second incisor and canine tooth (myrtiform fossa), and passes upwards and inwards to be inserted into the posterior part of the columna and ala nasi. It is closely connected with the deep sur- face of the orbicularis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, orbicularis oris and levator labii superioris alseque nasi; by its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone. Actions.—The pyramidalis nasi, as a point of attachment of the occipito-frontalis, assists that muscle in its action : it also draws down the inner angle of the eyebrow, and by its insertion fixes the aponeurosis of the compressores narium, and tends to elevate the nose. The compressores narium appear to act in expanding rather than compressing the nares ; hence probably the collapsed state of the nares from paralysis of these muscles in the last moments of life, or in compression of the brain. The dilatator naris is a dilator of the nostril, and the depressor alse nasi draws downwards both the ala and columna of the nose, the depression of the latter being assisted by the naso-labialis. 5. Superior Labial Group.— Orbicularis oris, Levator anguli oris, Levator labii superioris alseque nasi, Zygomaticus maj or, Levator labii superioris proprius, Zygomaticus minor. The Orbicularis oris is a sphincter muscle, completely sur- rounding the mouth, and possessing consequently neither origin nor insertion. It is composed of two thick semicircular planes of fibres,SUPERIOR LABIAL GROUP. 181 which embrace the rima of the mouth, and interlace at their extre- mities, where they are continuous with the fibres of the buccinator and the other muscles connected with the angle of the mouth. The upper segment is attached by means of a small muscular fasciculus (naso-labialis) to the columna of the nose ; and other fasciculi con- nected with both segments, and attached to the maxillary bones, are termed " accessorii." Several anatomists consider the orbicularis as composed of two portions, internal or marginal, in immediate contact with the lips, and thick; and external, broad and thin ; the separation between the two being indicated by the coronary arteries. Relations.—By its superficial surj?ace with the integument of the lips, with which it is closely connected. By its deep surface with the mucous membrane of the mouth, the labial glands and coronary arteries being interposed. By its circumference with the numerous muscles which move the lips, and by the inner border with the mucous membrane of the rima of the mouth. The Levator labii superioris aljbque nasi (pyramidalis) is a thin triangular muscle ; it arises from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone ; and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted by two portions, one into the ala of the nose, the other into the orbicularis oris and upper lip. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the orbicularis palpe- brarum, facial artery, and integument. By its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone, musculus anomalus, compressor naris, dilatator naris, and alar cartilage. The Levator labii superioris proprius (incisorius) is a thin quadrilateral muscle; it arises from the lower border of the orbit, and passing obliquely downwards and inwards, is inserted into the integument of the upper lip, its deep fibres being blended with those of the orbicularis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum, facial artery, and integument. By its deep surface with the compressor naris, levator anguli oris, orbicu- laris oris, and infraorbital artery and nerve. The Levator anguli oris (caninus) arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and passes obliquely outwards to be inserted into the angle of the mouth ; its fibres being continued into the inferior segment of the orbicularis, and depressor anguli oris. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator labii supe- rioris proprius, branches of the infraorbital artery and nerve, and inferiorly with the integument. By its deep surface with the supe- rior maxillary bone and buccinator muscle. The Zygomatic muscles are two slender fasciculi of fibres which arise from the malar bone, and are inserted into the upper lip. The zygomaticus major descends to the angle of the mouth, and is continuous with the inferior segment of the orbicularis, depressor anguli oris, and risorius Santorini. The zygomaticus minor, lying in front of the major, becomes connected with the outer border ofMUSCLES OP THE FACE. 182 the levator labii superioris proprius, and is attached to the integu- ment of the upper lip. This muscle is often wanting. Relations.—The zygomaticus major is in relation by its superfi- cial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum above, and with the fat of the cheek and integument for the rest of its extent. By its deep surface with the malar bone, masseter, buccinator, and facial vessels. The zygomaticus minor being in front of the major, has no relation with the masseter ; inferiorly it rests on the levator anguli oris. Actions.—The orbicularis oris produces the direct closure of the lips by means of its continuity, at the angles of the mouth, with the fibres of the buccinator. When acting singly in the forcible closure of the mouth, the integument is thrown into wrinkles, in consequence of its firm connexion with the surface of the muscle ; its naso-labial fasciculus draws downwards the columna nasi. The levator labii superioris alseque nasi lifts the upper lip with the ala of the nose, and expands the opening of the nares. The levator labii superioris proprius is the proper elevator of the upper lip : acting singly, it draws the lip a little to one side. The levator anguli oris lifts the angle of the mouth and draws it inwards, while the zygomatici pull it upwards and outwards, as in laughing, and produce the dimple in the cheek. In the movement of laughter the zygomatici are assisted by the risorius Santorini. 6. Inferior Labial Group.— Depressor labii inferioris, Risorius Santorini, Depressor anguli oris, Levator labii inferioris. Dissection.— To dissect the inferior labial region, continue the vertical section from the middle of the lower lip to the point of the chin. Then carry an incision along the margin of the lower jaw to its angle. Dissect off the integument and superficial fascia from this surface, and the muscles of the inferior labial region will be exposed. The Depressor labii inferioris (quadratus menti) arises from the oblique line by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and passing upwards and inwards, is inserted into the orbicularis muscle and integument of the lower lip. Its inner fibres interlace with those of the opposite muscle, the outer fibres reach nearly to the angle of the mouth. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the platysma myoides, part of the depressor anguli oris, and the integument of the chin with which it is closely connected. By the deep surface with the levator labii inferioris, labial glands, mucous membrane of the lower lip, and mental nerve and artery. The Depressor anguli oris (triangularis) is a triangular plane of muscle arising by a broad base from the external oblique ridge of the lower jaw, and inserted by its apex into the angle of the mouth,INFERIOR LABIAL AND MAXILLARY GROUPS. 183 where it is continuous with the levator anguli oris, zygomaticus major, and upper segment of the orbicularis. Near its insertion it is joined by the following muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument; by its deep surface with the depressor labii inferioris, buccinator and branches of the mental nerve and artery. The Bisorius Santorini is a thin and triangular muscle, con- sisting of a few scattered fasciculi of fibres which arise from the fascia covering the masseter muscle, and converge to the angle of the mouth, where they become connected with the outer border of the depressor anguli oris, and continuous with the zygomaticus major. This muscle is generally regarded as a part of the platysma myoides. The Levator labii inferioris (levator menti) is a short but strong muscle arising from the incisive fossa of the lower jaw, and inserted into the integument of the chin. It is in relation with the mucous membrane of the mouth, with its fellow, and with the de- pressor labii inferioris. Actions.—The depressor labii inferioris draws the lower lip directly downwards, and at the same time a little outwards. The depressor anguli oris, from the radiated direction of its fibres, will pull the angle of the mouth either downwards and forwards, or downwards and backwards, and be expressive of grief; or acting with the levator anguli oris, zygomaticus major, and risorius San- torini, will draw the angle of the mouth upwards and backwards or directly backwards. The levator labii inferioris raises and pro- trudes the integument of the chin. 7. Maxillary Group.— Masseter, Buccinator, Temporalis, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. Dissection.—The masseter has been already exposed by the pre- ceding dissection. The Masseter (/nao-ado/mac, to chew,) is a short, thick, and some- what quadrilateral muscle, composed of two planes of fibres, super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer arises by a strong aponeurosis from the malar process of the superior maxillary bone, lower border of the malar bone and zygoma ; and passes downwards and back- wards to heinserted into the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. The deep layer arises also from the zygomatic arch but extends farther back upon the zygoma, and passes downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus. This muscle is tendinous and muscular in structure ; and covered in by a fascia (fascia parotideo-masseterica) which is connected with the zygomatic arch above, and encloses the parotid gland behind. Relations.—By its external surface with the zygomaticus major,MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 184 risorius Santorini and platysma myoides, parotid gland and Stenon's duct, transverse facial artery, pes anserinus, and integument. By its internal surface with the temporal muscle, buccinator, from which it is separated by a mass of fat, and ramus of the lower jaw. By its posterior border with the parotid gland; by the anterior border with the facial artery and vein. Dissection.—Make an incision along the upper border of the zygoma, for the purpose of separating the temporal fascia from its attachment. Then saw through the zygomatic process of the malar bone, and through the root of the zygoma near the meatus audito- rius. Draw down the zygoma, and with it the origin of the mas- seter, and dissect the latter muscle away from the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. Now remove the temporal fascia from the rest of its attachment, and the whole of the temporal muscle will be brought into view. The Temporalis (crotaphytes) is a broad and radiating muscle, occupying a considerable extent of the side of the head, and filling the temporal fossa. It is covered in by a dense fascia (temporal fascia), which is attached along the temporal ridge on the side of the skull, extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the mastoid portion of the temporal; and inferiorly to the upper border of the zygoma. The muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the whole length of the temporal ridge, and by muscular fibres from the temporal fascia and entire surface of the temporal fossa. Its fibres converge to a strong and narrow tendon, which is inserted into the apex and internal surface of the coronoid process of the lower jaw. Relations.—By its external surface with the temporal fascia (which separates it from the attollens and attrahens aurem muscle, and temporal vessels and nerves) and with the zygoma and mas- seter. By its internal surface with the bones forming the tem- poral fossa, the external pterygoid muscle, part of the buccinator, and the internal maxillary artery with its deep temporal branches. By sawing through the coronoid process near its base, and pull- ing it upwards, together with the temporal muscle, which may be dissected from the fossa, we obtain a view of the entire extent of the buccinator and external pterygoid muscle. The Buccinator (buccina, a trumpet; alveolo-labialis), the trumpeter's muscle, arises from the alveolar process of the superior maxillary bone, the external oblique line of the inferior maxillary as far forward as the second bicuspid tooth, and the pterygo-maxil- lary ligament. This ligament is the raphe of union between the buccinator and superior constrictor muscle, and is attached by one extremity to the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the extremity of the molar ridge. The fibres of the muscle converge towards the angle of the mouth, where some are continuous with the levator and depressor anguli oris, and the rest cross each other, the superior being continuous with the inferiortemporal muscle, and in- 185 MAXILLARY GROUP. segment of the orbicularis oris, the inferior with the superior seg- ment. The muscle is invested externally by a thin fascia (buccal) which extends backwards to the pharynx. Relations.—By its external surface, posteriorly, with a large and rounded jnass of fat, which separates the muscle from the ramus of the lower jaw, temporalis, and masseter : anteriorly with the risorius Santorini, zygomatici, levator anguli oris, and depressor anguli oris. It is also in relation with a part of Stenon's duct, (which pierces it opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw,) with the transverse facial artery, branches of the facial and buccal nerve, and facial artery and vein. By its internal surf dee tttithV the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth. v> The Pterygoideus exterkus is a short and thick muscle, broader at its origin than at its insertion. It arises byi two^helKdl^ 1 one from the under surface of the great ala of the spher#$. and pterygoid ridge ; the other from the external pterygoid plate/tj^e^ rosity of the palate bone and tuberosity of the superior mteilliir^^'% The fibres pass backwards to be inserted into the neck of the^Ker> jaw and into the interarticular fibrocartilage. The internal maxilP*"***rt lary artery passes between the two heads of this muscle. Relations.—By its ex- ternal surface with the ramus of the lower jaw, ternal maxillary artery; by its internal surface with, the internal pterygoid muscle, internal lateral ligament of the jaw, arteria meningea media, and in- ferior maxillary nerve ; by its upper border with the muscular branches of the inferior maxillary nerve ; the internal maxillary ar- tery passes between its two heads, and its lower head is pierced by the buccal nerve. The external pterygoid muscle must now be removed, the ramus of the lower jaw sawn through its lower third, and the head of the bone dislocated from its socket and withdrawn, for the purpose of seeing the pterygoideus internus. The Pterygoideus internus is a thick quadrangular muscle. It arises from the pterygoid fossa and descends obliquely backwards, * The two pterygoid muscles. The zygomatic arch and the greater part of the ramus of the lower jaw have been removed, in order to bring these muscles into view. 1. The sphenoid origin of the external pterygoid. 2. Its pterygoid origin. 3. The internal pterygoid.

Relations.—By its external surface with the external pterygoid, inferior maxillary nerve and branches, internal maxillary artery and branches, internal lateral ligament, and ramus of the lower jaw. By its internal surface with the tensor palati, superior constrictor and fascia of the pharynx ; by its posterior border with the parotid gland. A ctions. —The maxillary muscles are the active agents in masti- cation, and form an apparatus admirably fitted for that office. The buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of the tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connexion with the superior constrictor, it shortens the cavity of the pharynx from before backwards, and be- comes an auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal pterygoid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterygoid in grinding the food, by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the upper ; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temporal. The whole of these muscles, acting in succession, produce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the upper, effects the mastication of the food. 8. Auricular Group.— Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Eetrahens aurem. Dissection.—The three small muscles of the ear may be exposed by removing a square of integument from around the auricula. This operation must be performed with care, otherwise the muscles, which are extremely thin, will be raised with the superficial fascia. They are best dissected by commencing with their tendons, and thence proceeding in the course of their radiating fibres. The Attollens aurem (superior auriculae), the largest of the three, is a thin triangular plane of muscular fibres, arising from the lateral portion of the galea aponeurotica and aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, at about the middle of the temporal ridge, and inserted into the convexity of the fossa triangularis of the pinna. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica and temporal fascia. The Attrahens aurem (anterior auriculae), also triangular, arises from the lateral portion of the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis above the zygoma, and is inserted into the spine of the helix. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument; and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica, temporal fascia, and temporal artery and veins.MUSCLES OP THE NECK. 187 The Retrahens attrem (posterior auriculas) arises by two (some- times three) muscular slips from the root of the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Actions.—The actions of the auricular muscles are expressed in their names ; they have but little power in man, but are important muscles in brutes. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups, cor- responding with the natural divisions of the region ; they are, 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Palatine group. 7. Prevertebral group. 8. Laryngeal group. The muscles in each group are ais follow: — 1. Superficial group. PJatysma myoides, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus. 3.

The square flap of integument thus included should be turned back from the entire side of the neck, which brings into view the superficial fascia, and on the removal of a thin layer of superficial fascia the platysma myoides will be exposed. The Platysma myoides (7rXari>s fids eTdos, broad muscle-like lamella ; latissimus colli; subcutaneus colli; thoraco-facialis) is a thin plane, of muscular fibres, situated beneath the integument on the side of the neck ; it arises from the fascia of the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, and passes obliquely upwards and inwards to be inserted into the side of the chin, oblique line of the lower jaw, angle of the mouth, and cellular tissue of the face. The ante- rior fibres are continuous beneath the chin, with the muscle of the opposite side; the next interlace with the depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris; the posterior fibres are disposed in a transverse direction across the lower part of the face, arising from the fascia of the parotid gland and masseter muscle, and inserted into the angle of the mouth (risorius Santorini). The entire muscle is analogous to the cutaneous muscle of brutes, the panniculus carnosus. Relations.'—By its external surface with the integument, with which it is closely adherent below, but loosely above. By its internal surface, below the clavicle, with the pectoralis major and deltoid; in the neck with the trapezius, sterno-mastoid, external jugular vein and deep cervical fascia; on the face, with the parotid gland, masseter, facial artery and vein, buccinator, depressor anguli oris, and depressor labii inferioris. On raising the platysma throughout its whole extent, the sterno- mastoid is brought into view. The Sterno-cleido-mastoideus is the large oblique muscle of the neck, and is situated between two layers of the deep cervical fascia. It arises, as implied by its name, from the sternum and clavicle (Kkeibiov), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards, to be inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal, and superior curved line of the occipital bone. The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a considerable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, separate from the sternal portion below, but blended with the posterior surface of the latter as it ascends. The two portions of this muscle are sometimes described as sepa- rate muscles under the names of sterno-mastoideus (nutator capitis internus, vel anticus) and cleido-mastoideus (nutator capitis ex-189 STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOIDEUS. ternus, vel posticus). A sesamoid bone is sometimes found in the sternal tendon ; this is regarded as the sternal rudiment of a cervical rib; and these osseous formations have been described. by Breschet under the name of ossa suprasternalia, vel episternalia.

It is pierced on this aspect by the spinal accessory nerve. The anterior border of the muscle is the posterior boundary of the great anterior triangle, the other two boundaries being the middle line of the neck in front, and the lower border of the jaw above. It is the guide to the operations for the ligature of the common carotid artery and arteria innominata, and, on the left side, for cesophagotomy. The posterior border is the anterior boundary of the great posterior triangle ; the other two boundaries being the anterior border of the trapezius behind, and the clavicle below. Actions.—The platysma produces a muscular traction on the integument of the neck, which prevents it from falling so flaccid in old persons as it would if the extension of the skin were the mere result of elasticity. It draws also on the angle of the mouth, and is one of the depressors of the lower jaw. The transverse fibres draw the angle of the mouth outwards.- The sterno-mastoid muscles (nutatores capitis) are the great anterior muscles of connexion between the thorax and the head. Both muscles acting together bow the head directly forwards. The clavicular portions, acting more forcibly than the sternal, give stability and steadiness to the head in supporting weights. Either muscle acting singly would draw the head towards the shoulder of the same side, and carry the face towards the opposite side. Second Group.—Depressors of the Os Hyoides and Larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Omo-hyoideus. Dissection.—These muscles are brought into view by removing the deep fascia from off the front of the neck between the two sterno-mastoid muscles. The omo-hyoid to be seen in its whole extent requires that the sterno-mastoid muscle be divided from its origin and turned aside. The Stebno-hyoideus is a narrow, riband-like muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum and from the posterior stefno-clavicular ligament (sometimes from the inner extremity of the clavicle, and sometimes from the cartilage of the first rib). It is inserted into the lower border of the os hyoides. The sterno-hyoidei are separated by a considerable interval at the root of the neck, approach each other as they ascend, and are againDEPRESSORS OF THE OS HYOIDES AND LARYNX. 191 separated on the thyroid cartilage; they are frequently traversed below t>y a tendinous intersection. Relations.—By its external surface with the deep cervical fascia, platysma myoides and sterno-mastoid muscle; by its internal surface with the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscle, and superior thyroid artery. The Sterno-thyroideus, broader than the preceding beneath which it lies, arises from the posterior surface of the upper bone of the sternum, and from the cartilage of the fist rib ; it is inserted into the oblique line on the great ala of the thyroid cartilage. The inner borders lie in contact along the middle line, and the muscles are marked by a tendinous intersection at their lower part. Some of the fibres of this muscle are continued directly into the thyro- hyoideus without intervening attachment; others are continuous with the inferior constrictor. Relations.—By its external surface with the sterno-hyoid, omo- hyoid, and sterno-mastoid muscle; by its internal surface, with the trachea, inferior-thyroid veins, thyroid gland, lower part of the ■larynx, sheath of the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, vena innominata, and, on the right side, arteria innominata. The middle thyroid vein lies along its inner border. The Thyro-hyoideus is the continuation upwards of the sterno- thyroid muscle. It arises from the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage, and is inserted into the lower border of the body, and great cornu of the os hyoides for one half its length. Relations.—By its external surface with the sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid muscle ; by its internal surface with the great ala of the thyroid cartilage, thyro-hyoidean membrane, and superior laryngeal artery and nerve. The Omo-hyoideus (&,uos, shoulder) is a double-bellied muscle passing obliquely across the neck from the scapula to the os hyoides ; it forms an obtuse angle behind the sterno-mastoid, and is retained in that position by a process of the deep cervical fascia which forms a sheath for its tendon and holds it in connexion with the sternum and first rib. It arises from the upper border of the scapula and transverse ligament of the suprascapular notch, and is inserted into the os hyoides at the junction of the body and great cornu. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sub- clavius, clavicle, deep cervical fascia, platysma myoides, sterno- mastoid eus, and integument. By its deep&urface with the brachial plexus, scaleni muscles, phrenic nerve, sheath of the common carotid artery and jugular vein, descendens noni nerve, sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscle, and. the sterno-hyoid at its insertion. The scapular portion of the muscle divides the great posterior triangle into a superior or occipital triangle, and an inferior or subclavian triangle; the latter contains the subclavian artery andMUSCLES OF THE NECK. 192 brachial plexus of nerves; the other two boundaries of the sub- clavian triangle being the sterno-mastoid in front and the clavicle below. The hyoid portion of the muscle divides the great anterior triangle into an. inferior carotid triangle situated below the muscle, and a superior triangle which lies above the muscle, and is again subdivided by the digastricus into the submaxillary triangle and superior carotid triangle. The other two boundaries of the inferior carotid triangle are the middle line of the neck in front and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid behind. The other boundaries of the superior carotid triangle are the posterior belly of the digastricus above and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid behind. Actions.—The four muscles of this group are depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. The three former drawing these parts downwards in the middle line, and the two omo-hyoidei regulating their traction to the one or other side of the neck, according to the position of the head. The omo-hyoid muscles, by means of their connexion with the cervical fascia, are rendered tensors of that portion of the deep fascia which covers the lower part of the neck, between the two sterno-mastoid muscles. Third Group.—Elevators of the Os Hyoides. Digastricus, Grenio-hyoideus, Stylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus. Mylo-hyoideus, Dissection.—These are best dissected by placing a high block beneath the neck, and throwing the head backwards. The integu- ment has been already dissected away, and the removal of some cellular tissue and fat brings them clearly into view. The Digastricus {pis, twice, yaarrip, belly, biventer) is a small muscle situated immediately beneath the side of the body of the lower jaw ; fleshy at each extremity, and tendinous in the middle. It arises from the digastric fossa and anterior border of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; pierces by its posterior belly the stylo-hyoideus muscle, and is inserted into a depression on the inner side of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis. The middle tendon is held in connexion with the body of the os hyoides by an aponeurotic loop, through which it plays as through a pulley ; the loop being lubricated by a synovial membrane. A thin layer of aponeurosis is given off fitom the tendon of the digastricus at each side, which is connected with the body of the os hyoides, and forms a strong plane of fascia between the anterior portions of the two muscles. This fascia, the supra-hyoidean, is continuous with the deep cervical fascia. Relations.—By its superficial surface with theplatysma myoides, sterno-mastoid, anterior fasciculus of the stylo-hyoid muscle, parotidELEVATORS OP THE OS HYOIDES. 193 gland, and submaxillary gland. By its deep surface with the styloid muscles, hyo-glossus, mylo-hyoideus, external carotid artery, lingual and facial artery, internal carotid artery, jugular vein, and hypoglossal nerve. The digastric muscle forms the two inferior boundaries of the submaxillary triangle, the superior boundary being the side of the body of the lower jaw. In the posterior half of the submaxillary triangle are situated the submaxillary gland and facial artery. The Stylo-hyoidetjs is a small and slender muscle situated in immediate relation with the posterior belly of the digastricus, by which it is pierced. It arises from the middle of the styloid process, its outer side, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides near the middle line. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the posterior belly of the digastricus, parotid gland and submaxillary gland ; its deep relations are similar to those of the posterior belly of the digastricus. The digastricus and stylo-hyoideus must be removed from their connexion with the lower jaw and os hyoides, and turned aside in order to see the next muscle. The Mylo-hyoideus (/AtiXv, mola, i.e., attached to the molar ridge of the lower jaw) is a broad and triangular plane of muscular fibres, forming, with its fellow of the opposite side, the inferior wall or floor of the mouth. It arises fleshy from the molar ridge of the Jower jaw as far back as the last molar tooth, and proceeds inwards and backwards to the middle line, where its fibres are con- tinuous with those of the opposite side, the posterior fibres being inserted into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides. At the middle line the union is tendinous on the upper surface in front, on the lower behind, the rest being fleshy. Relations. —By its superficial or inferior surface, with the pla- tysma myoides, digastricus, supra-hyoidean fascia, submaxillary gland, and submental artery. By its deep or superior surface with the genio-hyoideus, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, gustatory nerve, hypoglossal nerve, Wharton's duct, sublingual gland, and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. After the mylo-hyoideus has been examined, it should be cut away from its origin and insertion, and completely removed. The view of the next muscles would also be improved by dividing the lower jaw a little to the side of the symphysis, and drawing it outwards ; or removing it altogether if the ramus have been already cut across in dissecting the internal pterygoid muscle. The tongue may then be drawn out of the mouth by means of a hook. The Gtenio-hyoideus (yeveiov, the chin) arises from a small tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. It is a short and slender muscle, closely connected with its fellow and with the border of the following. oMUSCLES OP THE NECK. 194 Relations.—By its superficial or inferior surface with the mylo- hyoideus ; by the deep or superior surface with the lower border of the genio-hyo-glossus. 2%. 112.* The GrENIO-HTO-GLOS- sus(7A<3 <r era, thetongue) is a triangular muscle, narrow and pointed at z its origin from the lower f^, jaw, broad and fan- shaped at its attach- ment to the tongue.

Actions.—The whole of this group of muscles acts on the os hyoides when the lower jaw is closed, and on the lower jaw when the os hyoides is drawn downwards and fixed by the depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. The genio-hyo-glossus, is moreover, a muscle of the tongue ; its action upon that organ will be considered with the next group. * Styloid muscles and muscles of the tongue. 1.

Fourth Group.—Muscles of the Tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Styloglossus, Hyo-glossus, - Palato-glossus. Linguali s, These are already exposed by the preparation we have just made ; there remains, therefore, only to dissect and examine them. The Genio-hyo-glossus, the first of these muscles, has been de- scribed with the last group. The Hyo-glossus is a square-shaped plane of muscle, arising from the whole length of the great cornu and from the body of the os hyoides ; and inserted between the stylo-glossus and lingualis into the side of the tongue. The direction of the fibres of that portion of the muscle which arises from the body is obliquely backwards ; that from the great cornu obliquely forwards ; hence they are described by Albinus as two muscles, under the names of basio-glossus and cerato-glossus, to which he added a third fasciculus, arising from the lesser cornu, and spreading along the side of the tongue, the chondro-glossus. The basio-glossus slightly overlaps the upper part of the cerato-glossus, and is separated from it by the trans- verse portion of the stylo-glossus. Relations.—By its external surface with the digastricus, stylo- hyoideus, stylo-glossus, mylo-hyoideus, gustatory nerve, hypo- glossal nerve, Wharton's duct, and sublingual gland. By its in- ternal surface with the middle constrictor of the pharynx, lingualis, genio-hyo-glossus, lingual artery, and giosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Lingualis.—The fibres of this, muscle (lingualis longitudi- nals inferior) may be seen towards the apex of the tongue, issuing from the interval between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus ; and is best examined by removing the preceding muscle. It consists of a small fasciculus of fibres, running longitudinally from the base, where it is attached to the os hyoides, to the apex of the tongue. By the outer border its fibres reach the plane of longitu- dinal fasciculi of the stylo-glossus and lingualis superficialis ; and by its under surface it is in relation with the ranine artery. The other muscles entering into the structure of the tongue, are, the.lingualis longitudinalis superior vel superficialis; and the lin- gualis transversus. The lingualis superior forms a thin plane on the upper surface of the organ, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane. This layer is thicker in front than behind, and is covered posteriorly by a thin stratum of transverse fibres derived from the hyo-glossus. The lingualis transversus constitutes the chief bulk of the tongue ; it lies between the lingualis superior and inferior, its fibres being attached at the middle line to the fibro- cartilaginous septum. of the tongue, and laterally to the mucous membrane ; some of its fibres are continuous with those of the stylo-glossus and hyo-glossus, and others are connected with the lesser cornua of the os hyoides. o 2196 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The Styloglossus arises from the apex of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament; it divides on the side of the tongue into two parts, one transverse, which passes transversely inwards between the two portions of the hyo-glossns, and is lost among the transverse fibres of the substance of the tongue—the other longitudinal, which spreads out upon the side of the tongue, and is prolonged forwards with the lingualis as far as its tip. Professor Hyrtl of Prague has described a fasciculus of this muscle, which arises from the outer side of the styloid process, and is inserted into the cartilage of the meatus amis, under the name of stylo-auricularis. He states that it occurs once in every six bodies. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, gustatory nerve, parotid gland, sublingual gland, and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. By its internal sur- face with the tonsil, superior constrictor of the pharynx, and hyo- glossus. The Palato-glossus passes between the soft palate and the side of the base of the tongue, forming a prominence of the mucous membrane, which is called the anterior pillar of the soft palate. Its fibres are spread out superiorly among the muscular fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, and inferiorly among the fibres of the stylo- glossus upon the side of the tongue. This muscle with its fellow constitutes the constrictor isthmi faucium. Actions.—The genio-hyo-glossus muscle effects several movements of the tongue. When the tongue is steadied and pointed by the other muscles, the posterior fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus would dart it from the mouth, while its anterior fibres would restore it to its former position. The whole length of the muscle acting on the tongue, would render it concave along the middle line, and form a channel for the current of fluid towards the pharynx, as in.sucking. The apex of the tongue is directed to the roof of the mouth, and rendered convex from before backwards by the linguales. The hyo- glossi, by drawing down the sides of the tongue, render it convex along the middle line. It is drawn upwards at its base by the palato-glossi, and backwards or to either side by the stylo-glossi. Thus the whole of the complicated movements of the tongue may be explained, by reasoning on the direction of the fibres of the muscles, and their probable actions. The palato-glossi muscles, assisted by the uvula, have the power of closing the fauces completely, an action which takes place in deglutition. Fifth Group.—Muscles of the Pharynx. Constrictor inferior, Stylo-pharyngeus, Constrictor medius, Palato-pharyngeus. Constrictor superior, Dissection.—To dissect the pharynx, the trachea and oesophagus197 MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. are to be cut through at the lower part of the neck, and drawn upwards by dividing the loose cellular tissue which connects the back of the pharynx with the vertebral column. The saw is then to be applied behind the styloid processes, and the base of the skull sawn through. The vessels and loose structures should be removed from the preparation, and the pharynx stuffed with tow or wool for the purpose of distending it, and rendering the muscles more easy of dissection. The pharynx is invested by a proper pharyngeal fascia. The Constrictor inferior, the thickest of the three constrictor muscles, arises from the cricoid cartilage, and the oblique line of the thyroid. Its fibres spread out, and are inserted into the middle line of the pharynx, the inferior fibres being almost hori- zontal, the superior oblique and overlapping the middle constrictor. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column, longus colli, sheath of the common carotid artery, sterno-thyroid muscle, thyroid gland, and some lymphatic glands. By its internal surface with the middle constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pha- ryngeus, and mucous mem- brane of the pharynx. By its lower border, near the cricoid cartilage, it is in re- lation with the recurrent nerve ; ^nd by the upper border With the superior la- ryngeal nerve. The fibres of origin of this muscle are blended with those of the sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and crico-thyroid, and it frequently forms a tendi- nous arch across the latter; inferiorly it is blended with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. The muscle must be re- moved before the next can be examined. The Constrictor medius arises from the great cornu of the os hyoides, and from the lesser cornu. It radi- Fig. 113. * Side view of the muscles of the pharynx. 1. Trachea. 2. Cricoid carti- lage. 3. Crico-thyroid membrane. 4. Thyroid cartilage. 5. Thyro-hyoidean membrane. 6. Os hyoides. 7.

It is inserted into the raphe of the pharynx, and by a fibrous aponeurosis into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column, longus colli, rectus anticus major, carotid vessels, inferior con- strictor, hyo-glossus, lingual artery, pharyngeal plexus of nerves, and some lymphatic glands. By its internal surface, with the superior constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The upper portion of this muscle must be turned down, to bring the whole of the superior constrictor into view; in so doing, the stylo-pharyngeus muscle will be seen passing behind its upper border. The Constrictor superior is a thin and quadrilateral plane of muscular fibres arising from the side of the tongue, the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower jaw, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and lower third of the internal pterygoid plate ; and inserted into the raphe of the pharynx and basilar process of the occipital bone. Its superior fibres are arched, leaving a concave interspace between its upper border and the basilar process ; some of its lower fibres are continuous with those of the genio-byo-glossus on the side of the tongue, and it is overlapped inferiorly by the middle constrictor. Between the side of the pharynx and the ramus of the lower jaw is a triangular interval, the maxillo-pharyngeal space, which is bounded at the inner side by the superior constrictor muscle ; at the outer side by the internal pterygoid muscle ; and behind by the rectus anticus major and vertebral column. In this space are situ- ated the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, glosso-pharyn- geal, pneumogastric, spinal accessory, and hypoglossal nerve. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column and muscles of the latter, behind ; with the vessels and nerves con- tained in the maxillo-pharyngeal space laterally, and with the middle constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, and tensor palati. By its internal surface with the levator palati, palato-pharyngeus, tonsil, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The Sttlo-pharyngeus (levator seu dilatator pharyngis) is a long and slender muscle arising from the inner side of the base of the styloid process ; it descends between the superior and middle con- strictor muscle, and spreads out beneath the mucous membrane of the pharynx ; it is inserted partly into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and partly into the internal face of the inferior constrictor. Relations.—By its external surface with the stylo-glossus muscle, external carotid artery, parotid gland, and middle constrictor. By its internal surface with the internal carotid artery, internal jugular199 MUSCLES OP THE SOFT PALATE. vein, superior constrictor, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous mem- brane. Along its lower border is seen the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which crosses it opposite the root of the tongue, to pass between the superior and middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus. Associated in function with the preceding is a small muscle, not always present, the salpingo*-pharyngeus (levator pharyngeus in- ternus), which arises from the lower border of the Eustachian tube near its aperture, and passes down upon the inner surface of the side of the pharynx, where it becomes united with the palato-pharyngeus. The palato-pharyngeus is described with the muscles of the soft palate. It arises from the soft palate, and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharynx, and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. Actions.—The three constrictor muscles are important agents in deglutition ; they contract upon the morsel of food as soon as it is received by the pharynx, and convey it downwards into the oeso- phagus. The stylo-pharyngei draw the pharynx upwards, and widen it laterally. The palato-pharyngei also draw it upwards, and with the aid of the uvula close the opening of the fauces. The salpingo-pharyngei are elevators of the upper part of the pharynx. Sixth Group.—Muscles of the soft Palate. \ Levator palati, Palato-glossus, Tensor palati, Palato-pharyngeus. Azygos uvulae, Dissection.—To examine these muscles, the pharynx must be opened from behind, and the mucous membrane carefully removed from off the posterior surface of the soft palate. The Levator palati, a moderately thick muscle, arises from the extremity of the petrous bone and from the posterior and inferior aspect of the Eustachian tube, and passing down by the side of the posterior nares spreads out between the fasciculi of origin of the palato-pharyngeus ; it is inserted into the middle line, where it is continuous with the muscle of the opposite side, and is overlaid by the azygos uvulae. Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and superior con- strictor muscle ; internally and posteriorly with the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx and soft palate ; interiorly it passes between the two fasciculi of origin of the palato-pharyngeus to reach its insertion. This muscle must be turned down from its origin on one side, and removed, and the superior constrictor dissected away from its ptery- goid origin, to bring the next muscle into view. The Tensor palati (circumnexus) is a slender and flattened muscle ; it arises from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the internal * o-aKinyil, a tube.MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 200 pterygoid plate, from the spinous process of the sphenoid hone, and from the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube. It lies between the internal pterygoid muscle and internal pterygoid plate, and winding around the hamular process of the latter, expands into a tendinous aponeurosis, which is inserted into the transverse ridge on the horizontal portion of the palate bone, and at the middle line is continuous with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle. Relations. —By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle ; by its internal surface with the levator palati, internal pterygoid plate, and superior constrictor. In the soft palate, its tendinous expansion is placed in front of the other muscles, and in contact with the mucous membrane. The Azygos uvuLiB is a pair of small muscles situated along the mid line of the soft palate. They arise from the spine of the palate bone, and are inserted into the uvula. By their anterior surface they are in relation with the levatores palati, palato-glossi and ante- rior fasciculus of the palato- Fi9-114* pharyngei; posteriorly they , have the thin posterior fasci- / cuius of the palato-pharyngei and the mucous membrane. The two next muscles are brought into view by raising the mucous membrane from off the pillars of the soft pa- late at each side. The Palato-glosstjs (con- strictor isthmi faucium) is a small fasciculus of fibres, which arises in the soft palate as a radiated expansion con- tinuous with its fellow of the opposite side ; and descends to be inserted into the side of * Muscles of the soft palate. 1.

It is the prominence of this small muscle, covered by mucous membrane, that constitutes the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium, from a function it performs in common with the palato-pharyngeus, viz., constricting the opening of the fauces. The Palato-pharyngeus (constrictor isthmi faucium posterior) forms the posterior pillar of the fauces ; it arises by two fasciculi from the raphe of the soft palate, where its fibres are continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side ; and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharynx and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is broad above where it forms the whole thickness of the lower half of the soft palate, narrow in the posterior pillar, and again broad and thin in the pharynx where it spreads out previously to its insertion. The levator palati passes to its insertion between the two fasciculi of origin of this muscle. Relations.—In the soft palate it is in relation with the mucous membrane both by its anterior and posterior surface ; above, with the levator palati, and below with the mucous glands situated along the margin of the arch of the palate. In the posterior pillar, it is surrounded for two-thirds of its extent by mucous membrane. In the pharynx, it is in relation by its outer surface with the superior and middle constrictor muscle, by its inner surface with the mucous membrane. Actions.—The azygos uvulae shortens the uvula. The levator palati raises the soft palate, while the tensor spreads it out laterally so as to form a septum between the pharynx and posterior nares. Taking its fixed point from below, the tensor palati will dilate the Eustachian tube. The palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus con- strict the opening of the fauces, and drawing down the soft palate, serve to press the mass of food from the dorsum of the tongue into the pharynx. Seventh Group.—Prevertebral Muscles. Rectus anticus majoi*, Scalenus medius, Rectus anticus minor, Scalenus posticus, Scalenus anticus, Longus colli. Dissection.—These muscles have already been exposed by the removal of the pharynx from the anterior aspect of the vertebral column ; all that is further needed is the removal of the fascia by which they are invested. The Rectus anticus major (trachelo-suboccipitalis), broad and thick above, narrow and pointed below, arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebras ; and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone.

The Scalenus posticus, of small size, arises by a thin tendon from the second rib between its tubercle and angle, and divides superiorly into two or three tendons which are inserted into the posterior tubercles of the two or three lower cervical vertebras. The scalenus posticus was formerly described with the scalenus medius as one muscle ; while Albinus and Soemmering'make five scaleni. Relations.—hi front with the scalenus medius ; behind with the two upper levatores costaruin, and cervicalis ascendens. The Long-us colli (praedorso-atloideus) is a long and flat muscle, consisting of two portions. The upper arises from the anterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae. The lower portion arises from the bodies of the second, third, and fourth, and trans- verse processes of the fifth and sixth, and passes down the neck to be inserted into the bodies of the three lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebra?.

The scaleni muscles are flexors of the vertebral column ; and, acting from above, fix the first and second ribs for the inspiratory muscles. Eighth Group.—Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Chapter X. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the trunk may be subdivided into four natural groups : viz., 1. Muscles of the back. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perinseuni. 1. Muscles of the Bach.—The region of the bach, inconsequence of its extent, is common to the neck, upper extremities, and abdo- men : and its muscles, which are numerous, may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulas, Rhomboideus minor, Rhomboideus major. Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior, Serratus posticus inferior, Splenius capitis, Splenius colli. Fourth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Sacro-lumbalis, Longissimus dorsi, Spinalis dorsi. (Cervical Group.)

From the upper point of this incision carry a second transversely outwards to the back of the ear ; inferiorly an incision must be made from the extremity of the sacrum, along the crest of the ilium, to about its middle. For convenience of dissection, a fourth may be carried from the middle of the spine to the acromion process. The integument and super- ficial fascia, together, are to be dissected off the muscles in the course of their fibres, over the whole of this region. The Trapezius muscle (trapezium, a quadrangle with unequal sides) arises from the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchse, and from the supra- spinous ligament and spinous processes of the last cervical and all the dorsal vertebrae. The fibres converge from these various points, and are inserted into the scapular third of the clavicle, acromion process, and upper border of the spine of the scapula, as far back as its tubercle. The inferior fibres become tendinous, near the. scapula, and glide over the triangular surface at the origin of the spine, upon some loose cellular tissue. When the trapezius is dis- sected on both sides, the two muscles resemble a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle, on the posterior part of the shoulders ; hence the muscle was formerly named cucullaris (cucullus, a monk's cowl). The occipital portion of the muscle is extremely thin ; and the .origin of the cervical and upper part of the dorsal portion tendinous, forming, with the muscle of the opposite side, a tendinous trapezium. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, to which it is closely adherent by its cervical portion, loosely by its dorsal portion. By its deep surface, from above downwards, with the complexus, splenius, levator anguli scapulse, supra-spinatus, a small portion of the serratus posticus superior, rhomboideus minor, rhomboideus major, intervertebral aponeurosis which separates it from the erector spinse, and with the latissimus dorsi. The anterior border of the cervical portion forms the posterior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck. Its clavicular insertion sometimes advances to the middle of the clavicle, or as far as the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, and occasionally it has been seen to overlap the latter. This is a point to be borne in mind in the operation for ligature of the subclavian artery. The spinal accessory nerve passes beneath the anterior border, near the clavicle, previously to its distribution to the under surface of the muscle. The ligamentum nucha? is a thin fibrous band extended from the tubercle and spine of the occipital bone, to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supra- spinous ligament. It is connected with the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrse, excepting the atlas, by means of a series of small fibrous slips ; and is the analogue of an important elastic ligament in animals. . The Latissimus dorsi muscle covers the whole of the lower partMUSCLES OF THE BACK. 208 of the back and loins. It arises from the spinous processes of the four or six inferior dorsal, and all the lumbar vertebrae, from the supra-spinous ligament, spinous tubercles of the sacrum, posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and four lower ribs; the latter origin taking place by muscular slips, which indigitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive origin converge as they ascend, and cross the inferior angle of the scapula ; they then curve around the lower border of the teres major muscle, and terminate in a short quadrilateral tendon, which gets in front of the tendon of the teres, and is inserted into the bicipital groove. The tendinous origin of the muscle is united by its under surface with the posterior lamella of the fascia lumborum, and forms the posterior part of the sheath of the erector spinas ; it is also connected with the posterior aponeurosis of the obliquus internus. A synovial bursa is interposed between its upper border and the lower angle of the scapula, and another between the upper half of its tendon and that of the teres major ; the two tendons being united inferiorly. The muscle frequently receives a small fasciculus from the scapula as it crosses its inferior angle ; and sometimes by means of its tendon, a small muscular fasciculus from the pectoralis major ; its tendon also gives off fibres to the deep fascia of the upper arm. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, the latter being dense and fibrous in the lumbar region, and with the trapezius. By its deep surface, from below upwards, with the erector spinas, serratus posticus inferior, posterior aponeurosis of the obliquus internus, obliquus externus, serratus magnus, intercostal muscles and ribs, rhomboideus major, inferior angle of the scapula, and teres major. The latissimus dorsi, with the teres major, forms the posterior border of the axilla. Second Layer. Dissection.—This layer is brought into view by dividing the two preceding muscles near their insertion, and turning them aside. The Levator anguli scapulae (trachelo-scapularis) arises by tendinous slips, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of the four upper cervical vertebrae ; and is inserted into the upper angle and posterior border of the scapula, as far as the triangular smooth surface at the root of its spine. Being the prin- cipal elevator of the shoulder, the levator anguli scapulae has been termed muscidus patientioz. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sterno- mastoideus, and integument. By its deep surface with the splenius colli, transversalis cervicis, cervicalis ascendens, scalenus posticus, and serratus posticus superior. The tendons of origin are interposed between the attachments of the scalenus medius in front and the splenius colli and transversalis cervicis behind.EHOMBOIDEI. SERRATI. 209 The Rhomboideus minor (dorso-scapularis ; rhombus, a paralle- logram with four equal sides) is a narrow slip of muscle, detached from the rhomboideus major by a slight cellular interspace. It arises from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra and ligamentum nuchse ; and is inserted into the edge of the triangular surface, on the posterior border of the scapula. The Rhomboideus major arises from the spinous processes and inter-spinous ligaments of the four upper dorsal vertebrae ; and is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula as far as its inferior angle. The upper and middle portion of the insertion is effected by means of a tendinous band, which is attached in a longitudinal direction to the posterior border of the scapula. Relations.—By their superficial surface the rhomboid muscles are in relation with the trapezius, and the rhomboideus major with the latissimus dorsi and integument; by their deep surface with the serratus posticus superior, erector spinae, intercostal muscles • and ribs. Third Layer. Dissection.—The third layer consists of muscles which arise from the spinous processss of the vertebral column, and pass out- wards. It is brought into view by dividing the levator anguli scapulae near its insertion, and reflecting the two rhomboid muscles upwards from their insertion into the scapula. The latter muscles should now be removed. The Serratus posticus superior (dorso-costalis) is situated at the upper part of the thorax ; it arises from the ligamentum nuchae, and spinous processes of the last cervical and two upper dorsal vertebras. The muscle passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted by four serrations into the upper border of the second, third, fourth, and fifth rib, a little beyond their angle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, rhom- boideus major and minor, and serratus magnus. By its deep surface with the splenius, erector spinae, intercostal muscles and ribs. The Serratus posticus inferior (lumbo-costalis) arises from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the two lower dorsal and two or three upper lumbar vertebrae, and passing obliquely upwards, \s inserted by four serrations into the lower border of the four inferior ribs. Both muscles consist of a thin aponeurosis for about half their extent. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the latissimus dorsi, its tendinous origin being inseparably connected with the aponeurosis of that muscle. By its deep surface with the erector spinae, inter- costal muscles and lower ribs. The upper border is continuous with a thin tendinous layer, the vertebral aponeurosis. The Vertebral aponeurosis (fascia lumbo-dorsalis) is a thin membranous expansion, composed of transverse and longitudinal fibres, extending from the upper border of the serratus posticus pMUSCLES OF THE BACK. 210 inferior upwards beneath the serratus posticus superior to the neck, where it is lost in the cervical fascia. It is attached along the middle line to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae, externally to the angles of the ribs, and forms the posterior boundary of a triangular sheath, which contains the erector spinse and deep muscles of the back. The other two boundaries of the triangular sheath, are the ribs and vertebrae in front and the spinous processes of the vertebra? at the middle line. The serratus posticus superior must be removed from its origin and turned outwards, to bring into view the whole extent of the splenius muscle. The Splenius muscle is single at its origin, but divides soon after into two portions, which are destined to distinct insertions. It arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchae, the spinous process of the last cervical, and spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the six upper dorsal vertebrae ; it divides as it ascends the neck into the splenius capitis and splenius colli. The splenius capitis (cervico-mastoideus) is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone between the two curved lines, into the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and posterior border of the mastoid process. The splenius colli (dorso-trachelius) is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sterno- masboideus, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major, and serratus posticus superior. By its deep surface with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis colli, complexus, trachelo-mastoideus, and transversalis cervicis. The tendons of insertion of the splenius colli are interposed between and united with the tendons of the levator anguli scapulae in front, and the transversalis cervicis behind. The splenii of opposite sides of the neck leave between them a triangular interval, in which the complexus is seen. Fourth Layer. Dissection.—The two serrati and two splenii muscles must be removed by cutting them away from their origin and insertion, and the vertebral aponeurosis laid open, to bring the fourth layer into view. Three of these muscles: viz., sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and spinalis dorsi, are associated under the name of erector spinae. They occupy the lumbar and dorsal portion of the back. The remaining four are situated in the cervical region. The Sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi arise by a common origin from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, the oblique211 SACRO-LUMBALIS. sacroiliac ligament, articular and spinous tubercles of the sacrum, spinous processes of the lum- bar vertebrae, and, deeply, from the posterior transverse tubercles of the lumbar ver- tebrae ; the external portion being fleshy, the internal ten- dinous. The tendinous portion is broad and flat, and gives origin by its deep surface to a considerable part of the mus- cular fibres. In the lumbar region, the muscle proceeding from this extensive origin is a broad and thick musculo- tendinous mass, on the surface of which, opposite the last rib, a line of separation is appa- rent, the outer portion, about one-third, being the sacro- lumbalis, the inner two-thirds the longissimus dorsi. The sacro-lumbalis (ilio- costalis, Theile) ascends upon the chest internally to the angles of the ribs, and is inserted by separate slips, the four upper tendinous, the two lower fleshy, into the angles of the six lower ribs. If this muscle be turned a little outwards, a number of tendinous slips will be seen which take their origin from the upper border of the ribs near their angles, and termi- nate in muscular fasciculi, which prolong the sacro-lumba- lis to the upper part of the chest. This is the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem; it arises from the six lower ribs; and is * Fourth and fifth, and part of the sixth layer of the muscles of the back. 1.

Retzius, considering the separation of the accessorius as a diffi- culty to the student, treats it as the costal portion of the sacro- lumbalis, which latter he then describes as dividing into two sets of tendons, external or ascending, and internal or descending. These tendons cross each other in their course, and are inserted into the angles of all the ribs. The longissimus dorsi is inserted by two series of tendons, in- ternal and external ; the internal being implanted into the poste- rior transverse processes (processus accessorii) of the lumbar, and transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae ; the external, into the transverse processes (lumbar ribs) of the lumbar vertebrae, and all the ribs, excepting the first, between their tubercles and angles. The Spinalis dorsi arises from the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar and two lower dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the upper dorsal vertebrae from the second to the sixth or eighth. It also receives several fasciculi from the longissimus dorsi and semi-spinalis dorsi. The two muscles form an ellipse, which embraces the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae. Relations.—The erector spinae muscle is in relation by its super- ficial surface (in the lumbar region) with the serratus posticus in- ferior and latissimus dorsi; (in the dorsal region) with the verte- bral aponeurosis, which separates it from the latissimus dorsi, tra- pezius, and serratus posticus superior, and with the splenius. By its deep surface (lumbar region) with the multifidus spinae, trans- verse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and middle layer of the lumbar fascia, which separates it from the quadratus lumborum ; (dorsal region) with the multifidus spinae, semi-spinalis dorsi, levatores costarum, intercostal muscles, and ribs as far as their angles. Internally or mesially, with the multifidus spinae, and semi-spinalis dorsi, which separate it from the spinous processes and arches of the vertebrae. The fascia lumborum, with the spinal column, aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi, and ribs, forms a complete osseo-aponeurotic sheath for the erector spinae. The Cervicalis ascendens vel descendens is the continuation of the sacro-lumbalis upwards into the neck. It arises from the angle of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rib, and is inserted by slender tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. The term descendens, applied to this muscle, can only be correct when it is described as arising in the neck and passing downwards to the ribs. Relations. —By its superficial surface with the levator anguli scapulae ; by its deep surface with the upper intercostal muscles, ribs, and intertransverse muscles; externally with the scalenus posticus and medius; internally with the transversalis cervicis.TRANSVERSALIS CERVICIS.—COMPLEXUS. 213 The tendons of insertion are interposed between the attachments of the scalenus medius and posticus and transversalis cervicis, with which they are united. The Transversalis cervicis appears to be the continuation upwards into the neck of the longissimus dorsi; it arises from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, from the second to the sixth. It receives a fasciculus from the longissimus dorsi and several small slips from the trachelo-mastoideus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator anguli scapulas, splenius, and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with the complexus, trachelo-mastoideus, and vertebras; externally with the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem and cervicalis ascen- dens ; internally with the trachelo-mastoideus and complexus. The tendons of insertion of this muscle are interposed between the tendons of insertion of the cervicalis ascendens on the outer side, and those of origin of the trachelo-mastoid on the inner side. The Trachblo'MAStoideus (complexus parvus) is likewise a con- tinuation upwards from the longissimus dorsi. It is a slender and delicate muscle, arising from the transverse processes of the three upper dorsal and last cervical, and from the articular processes of the three next cervical vertebrae, its origin being similar to that of the complexus, with which and the origin of the transversalis cer- vicis it is closely connected. It receives a fasciculus from the lon- gissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the posterior border and summit of the mastoid process. Relations.—The same as the preceding muscle, excepting that it is interposed between the transversalis cervicis and complexus. The Complexus (trachelo-occipitalis) is a large muscle, forming with the splenius the great bulk of the back of the neck. It crosses the direction of the splenius, arising from the transverse processes of the three upper dorsal and last cervical, and from the articular processes of the three next lower cervical vertebrae ; and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone between the two curved lines, as far as the occipital spine. The complexus is marked in the upper part of the neck by a transverse tendinous intersection. A large fasciculus of the complexus lying superficially to that muscle, and remarkable for consisting of two fleshy bellies with an intermediate tendon, is usually described under the name of biventer cervicis. Considered as a separate muscle, it arises by three or four slips from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, from the fourth to the seventh ; and is inserted into the inner portion of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Its tendons of origin lie internally to the insertions of the longissimus dorsi, and are connected with those of the semi-spinalis colli; and its lower belly receives a fasciculus from the longissimus. The outer border of the214 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. upper belly is united with the complexus ; in the rest of its course it is free. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, splenius, trachelo-mastoideus, transversalis cervicis, and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with the semi-spinalis dorsi and colli, recti and obliqui. It is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the ligamentum nuchas, and from the semi-spinalis colli by the pro- funda cervicis artery, princeps cervicis branch of the occipital, and posterior cervical plexus of nerves. Fifth Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of the preceding layer are to be removed by dividing them transvex-sely through the middle, and turning one extremity upwards, the other downwards. In this way the whole of the muscles of the fourth layer may be dissected off, and the re- maining muscles of the spine brought into a state to be examined. The Semi-spinales muscles are connected with the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebrae, spanning one-half the verte- bral column ; hence their name semi-spiuales. The Semi-spinalis doksi arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras from the sixth to the tenth; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the four upper dorsal and two lower cervical vertebras. It is united below with the spinalis dorsi, and above with the semi-spinalis colli; it also sends several small slips to the longissimus dorsi. The Semi-spinalis colli, larger than the preceding, arises from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal vertebras; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the cervical vertebras from the second to the fifth. Relations.—By their superficial surface the semi-spinales are in relation from below upwards with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, complexus, splenius, profunda cervicis and princeps cervicis artery, and posterior cervical plexus of nerves. By their deep surface with the multifidus spinas muscle. On the middle line in the cervical region is a small muscle, the analogue of the spinalis dorsi, termed the spinalis cervicis. It is extremely irregular; arising from the spinous processes of the two upper dorsal or two lower cervical vertebras ; and inserted into the spinous process of the axis, and sometimes into the next one or two vertebras. Occipital Group.—This group of small muscles is intended for the movements of the cranium on the atlas, and atlas on the axis. The Rectus posticus major (superficialis) arises from the spinous process of the axis ; and is inserted into the inferior curved line of the occipital bone. The Rectus posticus minor (profundus) arises from the spinous tubercle of the atlas ; and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, beneath the inferior curved line.215 RECTUS LATERALIS.—MDLTIFIDUS SPE03. The Rectus lateralis arises from the trans-verse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, externally to the condyle. The Obliquus inferior (major) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and passes obliquely outwards to be inserted into the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. The Obliquus superior (minor) arises from the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas, and passes obliquely inwards to be inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, between the curved lines, and directly behind the mastoid process. Relations.—By their superficial surface the l'ecti and obliqui are in relation with a strong aponeurosis which separates them from the complexus. By their deep surface, with the atlas and axis. The rectus posticus major partly covers in the rectus minor. The rectus lateralis is in relation by its anterior surface with the internal jugular vein, and by its posterior surface with the vertebral artery. Sixth Layer. Dissection.—The semi-spinales muscles must be removed to ob- tain a good view of the multifidus spinas, which lies beneath them, and fills up the concavity between the spinous and transverse pro- cesses, the whole length of the vertebral column. The Multifidus spiNiE, consisting of about twenty-two small muscular fasciculi, extends along the vertebral groove from the sacrum to the axis. The muscle commences by tendinous fibres on the dorsum of the sacrum, proceeding from the lateral tubercles of the Sacrum and even from the lateral cornu of the coccyx, and passing obliquely upwards and inwards to the spinous tubercles. The fasciculi arise inferiorly from the sacrum, ilium, and tendon of the erector spinas; in the lumbar region from the articular and posterior transverse processes of the vertebras ; in the dorsal region from the transverse processes ; and in the cervical region from the articular processes of the four inferior vertebrae. They are inserted into the spinous processes and laruinas of all the vertebras from the sacrum to the axis. Of the twenty-two fasciculi, six are lumbar, twelve dorsal, and four cervical. Each fasciculus, separate below, spreads out as it ascends, and passing over the next vertebra, is inserted into the four or five immediately above it. The muscle is thick inferiorly ; and the uppermost fasciculus larger than those immediately below it. Under the name of rotatores dorsi, expressive of their action, Theile has described eleven pairs of small muscles, which appear to belong to the multifidus spinse, though separated from it by cellular tissue. The rotatores arise from the apex and upper border of a transverse process ; to be inserted into the lower border of the lamina of the vertebra above, as far as the base of the spinous pro- cess. The inferior rotatores are somewhat larger than the superior.TABLE OP ORIGIN AND INSERTION 216 OEIGIN. Layers. 1st Layer. Trapezius Latissimus dorsi 2nd Layer.

Relations.—-By its superficial surface with the longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis dorsi, and semi-spinalis colli. By its deep surface with the laminae and spinous processes of the vertebral column, and in the cervical region with the ligamentum nuchse. The Interspinales are small muscular slips arranged in pairs and situated between the spinous processes of the vertebrae. In the cervical region there are six pairs of these muscles, the first being placed between the axis and third vertebra, the sixth between the last cervical and first dorsal ; they are attached to the apices of the spinous processes, and are separated by the interspinous ligaments. In the dorsal region, rudiments of these muscles are occasionally met with between the upper and lower vertebrae, but are absent in the rest. In the lumbar region there are six pairs of interspinales, the first pair occupying the interspinous space between the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, the last, the space between the fifth lumbar and sacrum. They are thin, broad,, and imperfectly developed. Rudimentary interspinales are occasionally met with between the sacrum and coccyx; these are the analogues of the caudal muscles of brutes ; in man they are named collectively the extensor coccygis (sacro-coccygeus posticus). The Intertransversales (intertransversarii) are small quadri- lateral muscles situated between the transverse processes of the vertebrae. In the cervical region they are arranged in pairs cor- responding with the double conformation of the transverse processes, the vertebral artery and anterior division of a cervical nerve lying between them. The rectus anticus minor and rectus lateralis represent the intertransversales between the atlas and cranium. In the dorsal region the anterior intertransversales are represented by the intercostal muscles, while the posterior are mere tendinous bands, muscular only between the first and last vertebrae. In the lumbar region, the anterior intertransversales are thin, and occupy only part of the space between the transverse processes. Analogues of posterior intertransversales exist, in the form of small muscular fasciculi (interobliqui, interaccessorii) extended between the rudimentary posterior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The Levatores costarum (supra-costales) are divided into long and short. The short (breves) twelve in number at each side, arise from the apex and lower border of the transverse process of the last cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae ; and pass down- wards and outwards, radiating in their descent, to be inserted into the upper border of all the ribs, between the tuberosity and angle. The uppermost muscle is the smallest, and their breadth increases from above downwards. The levatores costarum longi, four in number at each side, arise from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, the seventh to the tenth, and are inserted into the four lower ribs; each muscle passing over a rib in its descent, and being attached to the rib below as far as its angle. The levatores longi lie superficially to the leva- tores breves and increase in size from above downwards.219 LEVATORES COSTARUM. Relations.—By their superficial surface with the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi and transversalis cervicis. By their deep surface with the ribs and intercostal spaces ; the levatores breves close the intercostal spaces, and are united by their external border with the intercostales externi. With regard to the origin and insertion of the muscles of the back, the student should be informed that no exact regularity attends their attachments. At the best, a knowledge of their pre- cise connexions, even were it possible to retain it, would be but a barren information, if not absolutely injurious, as tending to exclude more valuable learning. I have therefore arranged a plan, by which they may be more easily recollected, placing them in. a tabular form (pp. 216, 217), that the student may see at a glance, the origin and insertion of each, and compare the natural grouping and similarity of attachment of the various 'layers. In this manner their actions also will be better comprehended, and learnt with greater facility. In examining the table, the student will observe the constant recurrence of the number four in the origin and insertion of the muscles. Sometimes the four occurs at the top or bottom of a region of the spine, and frequently includes part of two regions, taking two from each, as in the case of the serrati. Again, he will perceive that the muscles of the upper half of the table take their origin from spinous processes, and pass outwards to transverse, whereas the lower half arise mostly from transverse processes. To the student I commit these reflections, and leave it to the peculiar tenor of his own mind to make such arrangements as will be best retained in his memory. Actions.—The upper fibres of the trapezius draw the shoulder upwards and backwards ; the middle fibres, directly backwards ; the lower, downwards and backwards. The lower fibres also act in producing rotation of the scapula on the chest. If the shoulder be fixed, the upper fibres will flex the spine towards the correspond- ing side. The latissimus dorsi is a muscle of the arm, drawing it backwards and downwards, and at the same time rotating it in- wards ; if the arm be fixed, the latissimus dorsi will draw the spine to that side, and, raising the lower ribs, be an inspiratory muscle; and if both arms be fixed, the two muscles will draw the whole trunk forwards, as in climbing or walking on crutches. The leva- tor anguli scapula? lifts the upper angle of the scapula, and with it the entire shoulder ; the rhomboidei carry the scapula and shoulder upwards and backwards. The serrati are respiratory muscles acting in opposition to each other, the serratus posticus superior drawing the ribs upwards, and thereby expanding the chest ; the inferior drawing the lower ribs downwards, and diminishing the cavity of the chest. The former is an inspiratory, the latter an expiratory muscle. The splenii muscles of one side draw the vertebral column backwards and to one side, and rotate the head towards the corresponding shoulder.220 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The muscles of opposite sides acting together, draw the head directly backwards. They are direct antagonists of the sterno-mastoid. muscles. The sacro-lumbalis with its accessory muscle, the longissimus dorsi and spinalis dorsi, are known by the general term of erector spinas, which sufficiently expresses their action. They keep the spine supported in the vertical position by their broad origin from below, and by their insertion, by distinct tendons, into the ribs and spinous processes. Being made up of a number of distinct fasci- culi, which act alternately, the spine is kept erect without fatigue, even when the muscles have to counterbalance a corpulent abdo- men. The continuations upwards of these muscles into the neck preserve the steadiness and uprightness of that region. When the muscles of one side act alone, the neck is rotated on its axis. The complexus, being attached to the occipital bone, draws the head backwards, and counteracts the muscles of the anterior part of the neck. It assists also in the rotation of the head. The semi-spinalis and mullificlus spina muscles act directly on the vertebra?, and contribute to the general action of supporting the vertebral column erect. The four little muscles situated between the occiput and the first two vertebrae, effect the various movements between these bones ; the recti producing the antero-posterior actions ; the obliqui the rotatory motions of the atlas on the axis. The actions of the remaining muscles of the spine, the inter- spinales and inter-transversales, are expressed in their names. They approximate their attachments and assist the more powerful muscles in preserving the erect position of the body. The levatores costarum raise the posterior parts of the ribs, and are probably more serviceable in preserving the articulation of the ribs from displacement, than in raising them in inspiration.221 MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. The principal muscles situated on the front and sides of the thorax belong in their actions to the upper extremity, with which they will be described. They are the pectoralis major and minor, subclavius and serratus magnus. The true thoracic muscles, which appertain exclusively to the actions of the ribs, are, the Intercostales externi, Subcostales, Intercostales interni, Triangularis sterni. The intercostal muscles are two planes of muscular and tendinous fibres directed obliquely between adjacent ribs and closing the inter- costal spaces. They are seen partially on the reflection of the pec- toral muscles, or on the inner surface of the chest. The triangularis sterni is within the chest, and requires the removal of the anterior part of the thorax to bring it into view. The Intercostales externi, eleven on each side, commence pos- teriorly at the tubercles of the ribs, and advance forwards to the costal cartilages, where they terminate in a thin aponeurosis which is continued onwards to the sternum. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and inwards, pursuing the same line with those of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. They are thicker than the internal intercostals, and more tendinous in structure. The Intercostales interni, also eleven on each side, commence anteriorly at the sternum, and extend backwards as far as the angle of the ribs, whence they are prolonged to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, corresponding with those of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen, and crossing those of the external intercostals. In structure the intercostal muscles consist of an admixture of muscular and tendinous fibres. They arise from the two lips of the lower border of the rib, the external from the outer lip, the internal from the inner; and are inserted into the upper border of the rib below, encroaching somewhat on its surfaces. The Subcostales (infracostales ; intracostales) are nine or ten small muscles situated within the thorax at its posterior part, and lying upon the ribs. They increase in size from above downwards, and the direction of their fibres corresponds with that of the inter- costales interni. Each muscle arises from the front of a rib, and is inserted into the front of the rib but one below; the first sub- costalis is often absent. Relations.—The external intercostals, by their external surface, with the muscles which immediately invest the chest, viz., pecto- ralis major and minor, serratus magnus, serratus posticus superior and inferior, scalenus posticus, sacro-iumbalis and longissimus dorsi222 MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. with their continuations, cervicalis ascendens and transversalis cer- vicis, levatores costarum, and obliquus exlernus abdominis. By their internal surface with the internal intercostals, intercostal vessels and nerves, and posteriorly with the pleura, a thin aponeu- rosis being interposed. The internal intercostals, by their external surface with the external intercostals, and intercostal vessels and nerves ; by their internal surface with the pleura costalis, trian- gularis sterni, subcostales, and diaphragm. The Triangularis sterni (sterno-costalis), situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the side of the sternum, ensiform cartilage, and sternal ex- tremities of the costal cartilages from the third to the sixth or seventh ; it is inserted by fleshy digitations into the second, third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages and corresponding ribs. Relations.—By its external surface with the sternum, ensiform cartilage, costal cartilages, internal intercostal muscles, and internal' mammary vessels. By its internal surface with the pleura cos- talis, cellular tissue of the anterior mediastinum, and diaphragm. The lower fibres of the triangularis sterni are continuous with those of the transversalis abdominis. Actions.—The intercostal muscles raise the ribs when they act from above, and depress them when they take their fixed point from below. They are, therefore, both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The triangularis sterni draws down the costal cartilages, and is therefore an expiratory muscle. The muscles of respiration, according to Dr. Barclay, are as follow :— Dilating, or inspiratory muscles. Intercostales, Subcostales, Levatores costarum, Diaphragma, assisted occasionally by the Sterno-cleido-mastoidei, Subclavii, Scaleni, Pectoraies majores, Serrati postici superiores, Latissimi dorsi, Pectoraies minores, Cervicales ascendentes, Serrati magni, Accessorii ad sacro-lumbales. Contracting, or expiratory muscles. Triangulares sterni, Transversales abdominis, Obliqui externi, Recti abdominis, Obliqui interni, Pyramidales, assisted occasionally by the Serrati postici inferiores, Quadrati lumborum, Longissimi dorsi, Serrati magni. Sacro-lumbales, To which may be added, as expiratory powers, the costal car- tilages ; acting by virtue of their elasticity.223 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The muscles of the abdominal region are, the— Obliquus externus (descendens), Rectus, Obliquus internus (ascendens), Pyramidalis, Cremaster, Quaclratus lumborum, Transversalis, Psoas parvus, Diaphragma. Dissection.—The dissection of the abdominal muscles is to be commenced by making three incisions :—The first, vertical, in the middle line, from over the lower part of the sternum to the pubes ; the second, oblique, from the umbilicus, upwards and outwards, to the outer side of the chest, as high as the fifth or sixth rib; the third, oblique, from the umbilicus, downwards and outwards, to the crest of the ilium and along the crest to its middle. The three flaps included by these incisions should then be dissected back in the direction of the fibres of the external oblique muscle, beginning at the angle of each. The integument and superficial fascia should be dissected off together, so as to expose the fibres of the muscle at once. When the external oblique muscle is dissected on both sides, a white tendinous line will be seen along the middle of the abdomen, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes ; this is the linea alba. A little external to it, on each side, two curved lines will be observed extending from the eighth rib to the spine of the pubes, and bounding the recti muscles ; these are the lineos semilunarxs. Some transverse lines, linece transversa^, three in number, connect the linese semilunares with the linea alba at and above the um- bilicus . The External obltque muscle {obliquus externus abdominis, descendens: costo-abdominalis) is the external flat muscle of the abdomen. Its name is derived from the obliquity of its direction, and the descending course of its fibres. It arises by fleshy digita- tions from the external surface of the eight inferior ribs ; the five upper digitations being received between corresponding processes of the serratus magnus, the three lower, of the latissimus dorsi. The fleshy fasciculi proceeding from this extensive origin terminate on the front of the abdomen in a broad aponeurosis, and posteriorly are inserted into the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, for two-thirds its length, and into the anterior superior spinous process. The aponeurosis is united, in front, by its under surface, with that of the obliquus internus, forming the anterior wall of the sheath of the rectus, and is inserted into the linea alba, front of the pubes, spine of the pubes and pectineal line.

Poupart's ligament below. It should be divided behind by a vertical incision extending from the last rib to the crest of the ilium, as its lumbar attachment cannot at present be examined. The muscle is then to be turned forwards. Some degree of care will be required in performing this dissection, from the difficulty of distinguishing between this muscle and the one beneath. A thin layer of cellular tissue is all that separates them for the greater part of their extent. Near the crest of the ilium the circumflexa ilii artery ascends be- tween the two muscles, and forms a guide to their separation ; but just above Poupart's ligament they are so closely united, that sepa- ration is impossible. The Transversalis (lumbo-abdominalis) is the internal flat muscle of the abdomen ; and is transverse in the direction of its fibres, as implied in its name. It arises from Poupart's ligament, somewhat less than the outer half, from the anterior two-thirds of the internal lip of the crest of the ilium ; from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae through the medium of the posterior aponeurosis, and from the inner surface of the six inferior costal cartilages. The superior fibres, proceeding from the cartilage of the seventh rib, are inserted into the ensiform cartilage ; the inferior fibres, proceeding from Poupart's ligament, curve down- wards to be inserted by means of a tendinous expansion common to it and ihe internal oblique, the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis, into the pectineal line of the pubes; while the fibres intermediate between these points terminate near the outer border of the rectus in an aponeurosis, which is continued onwards to the linea alba. The upper portion of the aponeurosis, closely united with the posterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, assists in forming the posterior wall of the sheath of the rectus, while the inferior portion, commencing at a point midway between the umbilicus and pubes, is continued with the undivided aponeurosis of the internal oblique in front of the rectus. The posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis divides into three lamellae, anterior, middle, and posterior, which constitute the fas cia lumborum. The anterior lamella, thin and membranous, is attached to the base of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra?; the middle lamella, of considerable thickness, to their apices ; the posterior layer receives the attachment of the posterior aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and farther back, near the border of the erector spina?, becomes united with the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. Between the anterior and middle lamella is lodged the quadratus lumborum ; and between the middle and pos- terior layer, the erector spina? and multifidus spina?, which are thus furnished with aponeurotic sheaths. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal oblique, the internal surface of the six lower ribs, and internal intercostal muscles.

The spermatic cord and oblique inguinal hernia pass beneath the lower border, but have no direct relation with it. The upper border is continuous with the diaphragm and triangularis sterni. To dissect the rectus muscle, its sheath should be opened by a vertical incision extending from over the cartilages of the lower ribs to the front of the os pubis. Fig. 120. The sheath may then be dis- sected off and turned aside:; this is easily done excepting at the linese transverste, where a close adhesion sub- sists between the muscle and the external wall of the sheath. The sheath con- tains the rectus and pyra- midalis muscle. .The Rectus (sterno-pu- bius) arises by a double tendon from the front and crest of the os pubis, and is inserted by three broad digi- tations into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. It is traversed by several tendinous intersec- tions, called licese trans- versa (inscriptiones tendi- ness). One of these is situ- ated at the umbilicus, one over the ensiform cartilage, and one midway between these points; when a fourth exists, it occurs below the umbilicus.

Relations.—By its external surface with the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, below with the aponeurosis of the transversalis, and with the pyramidalis. By its internal surface with the ensiform cartilage, cartilages of the ribs from the fifth to the ninth, posterior lamella of the internal oblique, perito- neum, and epigastric artery and veins. The Pyramidalis (pubio-subumbilicalis) arises from the crest of the os pubis in front of the rectus, and is inserted into the linea alba at about midway between the umbilicus and pubes. It is enclosed in the sheath with the rectus, and rests against the lower part of that muscle; it is sometimes absent. The rectus may now be divided across the middle, and the two ends drawn aside for the purpose of examining the mode of con- struction of its sheath. The sheath of the rectus is formed, in front, for the upper three- fourths of its extent, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique and anterior lamella of the internal oblique; behind by the posterior lamella of the internal oblique and aponeurosis of the transversalis. Midway between the umbilicus and the pubes, the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin (plica semilunaris, Douglassii) the aponeurosis of the three muscles passing, below this point, altogether in front of the rectus. The next two muscles can be examined only when the viscera of the abdomen are removed. To see the quadratus lumborum, it is also necessary to divide and draw aside the psoas muscle and the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis. The Quadratus lumborum (ilio-costalis) is concealed from view by the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the trans- versalis muscle, which is inserted into the bases of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. When this lamella is divided, the muscle will be seen to consist of two portions :—one, the external, arising from the ilio-lumbar ligament and ©ater lip of the crest of the ilium for two inches in extent, and inserted into the apices of the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebras (sometimes also last dorsal) and last rib; the other, the internal and anterior portion, arises by tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the three or four lower lumbar vertebrae, and passes upwards to be inserted into the lower border of the last rib. , If the muscle be cut across or removed, the middle lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis will be seen, attached to the apices of the transverse processes; the quadratus being enclosed between the two lamellae as in a sheath. Relations.—Enclosed in the sheath formed by the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, it is in relation, in front, with the kidney, colon, psoas magnus, and diaphragm. Behind, but also separated by its sheath, with the erector spinas.230 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The Psoas parvus is a small and infrequent muscle which arises from the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra and from the inter- vertebral substance between them, and terminates in a long slender tendon which expands inferiorly and is inserted into the iiio-pecti- neal line and eminence. The tendon is continuous by its outer border with the iliac fascia. Relations.—It rests on the psoas magnus, and is covered in by the peritoneum ; superiorly it passes beneath the ligamentum arcua- tum internum of the diaphragm. Diaphragm a.—To obtain a good view of this important inspi- ratory muscle, the peritoneum should be dissected from its under surface. It is a transverse muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, and is composed of two portions, thoracic and lumbar, the former being named the greater, the latter the lesser muscle. The thoracic portion arises from the ensiform cartilage by a dis- tinct slip and from the internal surface of the six inferior ribs indi- gitating with the transversalis. The fibres converge to be inserted into the central tendon.

A protrusion of any portion of the contents of the abdomen through this opening constitutes phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia. The lumbar portion consists of a right and left lateral half {'pil- lars, crura); each of which is composed of three smaller pillars or crura, internal, middle, and external.

The crura arise from the front and lateral aspect of the bodies of the first, second, and third lumbar vertebrae, from the interverte- bral substance between the first, second, third, and fourth, from the transverse process of the first, ligamentum arcuatum internum and externum, and last rib. The left cms is shorter than the right by the breadth of a vertebra, and does not advance so far for- ward on the front of the vertebral column. The crura are inserted into the whole length of the posterior border of the central tendon. The origin of the crura takes place by a strong tendon, from which and from the other points of attachment muscular fibres pro- ceed. The internal pillar of the crus is its anterior fasciculus, which proceeds from the third lumbar vertebra; the middle pillar, smaller than the others, proceeds from the second vertebra ; the external pillar, the largest of the three, from the first lumbar ver- tebra, ligamenta arcuata and last rib. The internal pillars ap- proach each other as they ascend, the arched interval between them being the aortic opening; their internal fibres, consisting of several fasciculi, cross each other in front of the aortic opening and form the lateral boundaries of another opening of elliptical shape (oesopha- geal), and are then lost in the central tendon. In the decussation between the aortic and oesophageal opening the fibres of the right internal pillar are generally the most superficial. Between the lumbar and costal portion of the diaphragm at each side is a trian- gular interval like that between the costal and sternal portion, closed only by cellular tissue and the serous membranes of the two cavities. The ligamentum arcuatum internum is a tendinous arch thrown across the upper part of the psoas muscle from the side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra to the apex of its transverse process, extending sometimes also to that of the second. Beneath this arch the psoas magnus emerges from the chest. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is a tendinous band ex- tended from the apex of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the lower border of the last rib. It forms an arch, across the quadratus lumborum and is continuous with the anterior wall of the sheath of that muscle derived from the posterior apo- neurosis of the transversalis abdominis. The tendinous centre of the diaphragm is shaped like a trefoil leaf, of which the central leaflet points to the ensiform cartilage, and is the largest ; the lateral leaflets, right and left, occupy the corresponding portions of the muscle ; the right being the larger and rounded, the left smaller and lengthened in its form. The openings in the diaphragm are three : one, quadrilateral, in the tendinous centre, at the union of the right and middle leaflets, for the passage of the inferior vena cava ; a muscular opening of an elliptical shape formed by the internal pillars of the crura, the oesophageal, for the transmission of the oesophagus and pneumo- gastric nerves; a third, the aortic, formed by a tendinous arch233 DIAPHRAGMA. thrown from the tendon of one crus to that of the other, beneath which pass the aorta and thoracic duct. The great splanchnic nerve passes through the diaphragm between the internal and middle pillar of the crus ; the trunk of the sympathetic and vena azygos between the middle and external pillar. The lesser splanchnic nerve escapes between those fibres of the external pillar which pro- ceed from the ligamentum arcuatum internum. Relations.—By its superior surface with the pleurae, pericar- dium, heart, and lungs. By its inferior surface with the perito- neum ; on the left with the stomach and spleen ; on the right with the convexity of the liver ; behind, with the kidneys, supra-renal capsules, duodenum, and solar plexus. By its circumference with the ensiform cartilage, ribs, intercostal muscles, and vertebral column. Actions.—The external oblique muscle, acting singly, would draw the thorax towards the pelvis, and twist the body to the op- posite side. Both muscles, acting together, flex the thorax directly on the pelvis. The internal oblique of one side draws the chest downwards and outwards : both together bend it directly forwards. Either transversalis muscle, acting singly, will diminish the size of the abdomen on its own side, and both together will constrict the entire cylinder of the cavity. The recti muscles, assisted by the pyramidales, flex the thorax towards the pelvis, and, through the medium' of the lineae transversa, are enabled to act when their sheath is curved inwards by the action of the transversales. The pyramidales are tensors of the linea alba. The abdominal are ex- piratory muscles, and chief agents in expulsion ; by their action, the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the urine from the bladder, faeces from the rectum, bile from the gall-bladder, ingesta from the sto- mach and bowels in vomiting, and mucus and irritating substances from the bronchial tubes, trachea, and nasal passages during cough- ing and sneezing. To produce these effects, they all act together. Their violent and continued action produces hernia, and, acting spasmodically, they may occasion rupture of the viscera. The qua- dratus lumborum draws the last rib downwards, and is an expira- tory muscle ; it also serves to bend the vertebral column to one or the other side. The psoas parvus is a tensor of the iliac fascia, and, taking its fixed origin from below, may assist in flexing the verte- bral column forwards. The diaphragm is an inspiratory muscle, and the sole agent in tranquil inspiration. When in action, the muscle is drawn downwards, its plane being rendered oblique from the level of the ensiform cartilage, to that of the upper lumbar ver- tebra. During relaxation it is convex, and encroaches considerably on the cavity of the chest, particularly at the sides, where it cor- responds with the lungs. It assists the abdominal muscles power- fully in expulsion, every act of that kind being preceded or accom- panied by inspiration. Spasmodic action of the diaphragm produces hiccough and sobbing, and its rapid alternation of contraction and234 ACTIONS OP MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. relaxation, combined with laryngeal and facial movements, laughing and crying. The actions of the muscles of the trunk, the neck, and the head, may be conveniently studied by means of a table arranged according to the plan of Dr. Barclay. Thus, the head, the neck and the trunk are moved forwards or flexed, backwards or extended, or laterally, that is abducted from the middle line, by the several muscles, as follows :— Head. Flexors.

The flexors and extensors of one side acting alone, are abductors ; acting in groups, they combine more or less flexion or extension with abduction, and are consequently rotators.

The muscles of the perineum are situated in the outlet of the pelvis, and consist of two groups, one of which belongs especially to the organs of generation and urethra, the other to the termination of the alimentary canal. To these may be added the anterior muscles of the coccyx. The muscles of the perineal region in the male, are the Accelerator urinse, Sphincter ani, Erector penis, Levator ani, Transversus perinei, Coccygeus, Compressor urethra, Sacro-coccygeus anticus. Dissection.—To dissect the perineum, the subject should be fixed in the position for lithotomy, that is, the hands should be bound to the soles of the feet, and the knees kept apart. An easier plan is the drawing of the feet upwards by means of a cord passed through a hook in the ceiling. Both of these means of preparation have for their object the full exposure of the perineum. And as this is a dissection which demands some degree of delicacy and nice manipu- lation, a strong light should be thrown upon the part. Having fixed the subject, and drawn the scrotum upwards by means of a string or hook, carry an incision from the base of the scrotum along the ramus of the pubes and ischium and tuberosity of the ischium to a point parallel with the apex of the coccyx ; then describe a curve over the coccyx to the same point on the opposite side, and continue the incision onwards along the opposite tuberosity and ramus of the ischium and pubes, to the opposite side of the scrotum, where the two extremities may be connected by a transverse incision. . This incision will completely surround the perineum, following very nearly the outline of its boundaries. Now let the student dissect off the integument carefully from the whole of the included space, and he will expose the fatty cellular structure of the common super- ficial fascia, which resembles the superficial fascia in other situa- tions. The common superficial fascia is then to be removed to the same extent, exposing the superficial perineal fascia. This layer is also to be turned aside, when the muscles of the genital region of the perineum will be brought into view. The Acceleratores URiNiE (bulbo-cavernosi) arise from a ten- dinous point in the centre of the perineum and from the fibrous raphe of the two muscles. From this origin the fibres diverge like the barbs of a pen ; the posterior to be inserted into the triangular ligament and ramus of the pubes ; the middle, to encircle the cor- pus spongiosum and meet on its upper side ; the anterior, to spread out on the corpus cavernosum at each side, and be inserted, partly into its fibrous structure, and partly into the fascia penis. TheACCELERATORS URIN2E.—TRANSVERSUS PERINEI. 237 posterior and middle insertions of these muscles are best seen by carefully raising one muscle from the corpus spongiosum and tracing its fibres. Relations.—By tbeir superficial surface with, the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, superficial vessels and nerves of the perineum, and, on each side, the erector penis. By their deep surface with the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra. The Erector penis (ischio-cavernosus) arises from the tuberosity of the ischium and from the ramus of the pubes on each side of the crus, and curves around the root of the penis ; to be inserted into the upper surface of the corpus cavernosum, where it is continuous with a strong fascia which covers the dorsum of the organ, the fascia penis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, and superficial perineal vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the corpus cavernosum penis.

A small slip of muscle is sometimes found in front of the trans- versa perinei : this is the transversus perinei alter. By its inner end it is continuous with the accelerator. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, and superficial perineal vessels and nerves. By its deep sur- face with the triangular ligament and internal pudic artery and veins. By its posterior border it is in relation with that portion of the superficial perineal fascia which passes upwards to become con- tinuous with the triangular ligament. To dissect the compressor urethra, the three preceding muscles should be removed, so as to render the glistening surface of the triangular ligament apparent. This ligament should then be care- fully dissected away, and the corpus spongiosum penis divided through its middle, separated from the corpus cavernosum, and drawn forwards in order to put on the stretch the membranous por- tion of the urethra, with which the compressor muscles are con- nected. The compressor urethrse is, however, better seen in a dissection made from within the pelvis, after having turned down the bladder from its attachment to the os pubis, and removed a plexus of veins together with the pelvic fascia. The Compressor urethra (constrictor urethrse membranacese, constrictor isthmi urethrae) directed transversely across the peri- neum above the triangular ligament arises from the ramus of the pubes and ischium, their point of union, and from the anterior ligament of the bladder and prostate gland. Proceeding inwards it divides into two fan-shaped fasciculi, superior and inferior, which embrace the membranous portion of the urethra, and are continuous with the muscle of the opposite side. The superior fasciculus is continued forward to the junction of the crura penis, and backwards to the prostate gland ; on the upper surface of which it is spread out. The inferior fasciculus is attached to the bulb of the urethra in front, and extends to the prostate gland behind. A third fasci- culus, closely united with the two preceding, consists of circular fibres, which enclose and form a muscular sheath for the mem- branous part of the urethra. Under the name of Wilson's muscles, a fourth fasciculus has been described as descending vertically from the body of the pubes, near the symphysis, to unite with the superior fasciculus of the com- pressor urethraa. This fasciculus is inconstant and its existence doubtful. * I have twice dissected a perineum in which the transversus perinei was of large size, and spread out as it approached the middle line so as to become fan-shaped. The posterior fibres were continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side; but the anterior were prolonged forwards upon the bulb and corpus spongiosum of the urethra as far as the middle of the penis, form- ing a broad layer which usurped the place and office of the accelerator urinae.241 FEMALE PERINEUM. The Constrictor vaginae is analogous to the accelerator urinse of the male; it arises from the tendinous centre of the perineum, where it is continuous with the sphincter ani and transversus perinei; and passes forwards on each side of the entrance of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpus cavernosum clitoridis. The Erector clitoridis wises from the ramus of the ischium, and is inserted on each side into the crus clitoridis. It is in rela- tion by its inner border with the constrictor vaginae. The Transversus perinei is a small muscle arising on each side from the ramus of the. ischium, and inserted into the side of the constrictor vaginae. The Compressor urethra has the same origin and insertion, and exercises the same functions in the female as in the male. The Sphincter ani and Sphincter ani internus surround the lower extremity of the rectum, as in the male. The Levator ani is inserted into the side of the vagina and rectum. The Cocctgeus and Sacro-coccygeus anticus are identical with the same muscles in the male. A ctions.—The acceleratores urinse being continuous at the middle line, and attached at each side to the triangular ligament, by means of their posterior fibres, support the bulbous portion of the urethra, and acting forcibly, propel the semen, or the last drops of urine from the canal. The posterior and middle fibres, according to Krause,* contribute to the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compressing the venous structure of the bulb; and the anterior fibres, according to Tyrrell, + assist in the erection of the entire organ by compressing the vena dorsalis, by means of their insertion into the fascia penis. The erector penis becomes entitled to its name from spreading out on the dorsum of the organ into a mem- branous expansion (fascia penis), which, according to Krause, com- presses the dorsal vein during the action of the muscle, and espe- cially after the erection of the organ has commenced. The trans- verse muscles serve to steady the tendinous centre, that the muscles attached to it may obtain a firm point of support. According to Cruveilhier, they draw the anus backwards during the expulsion of the fasces, and antagonise the levatores ani, which carry the anus forwards. The compressor urethras, taking its fixed point from the ramus of the ischium at each side, can, says Guthrie, '' cOmpress the urethra so as to close it; I conceive completely, after the manner of a sphincter." The external sphincter, being a cutaneous muscle, contracts the integument around the anus, and by its attachment to the tendinous centre of the perineum and point of the coccyx, assists the levator ani in giving support to the opening during ex- pulsive efforts. The internal sphincter contracts the extremity of * Miiller Archiv fiir Anatomie, Physiologie, &c. 1837. t Lectures in the College of Surgeons. 1839. R242 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. the cylinder of the intestine. The use of the levator ani is expressed in its name; it is the antagonist of the diaphragm and abdominal expulsory muscles, and serves to support the rectum and vagina during their expulsive efforts. The levator ani acts in unison with the diaphragm, and rises and falls like that muscle in forcible re- spiration. Yielding to the propulsive action of the abdominal muscles, it enables the outlet of the pelvis to bear a greater force than a resisting structure, and, on the remission of such action, restores the perineum to its original form. The coccygei and sacro-coccygei muscles restore the coccyx to its natural position, after it has been pressed backwards during defeecation or parturition. Dr. Barclay styles the levatores ani, transversi perinei, sphinc- teres ani, coccygei and curvatores coccygis, moderator muscles, " which, after moderating the motor muscles, become motor muscles themselves ; and, acting successively in compressing the rectum, expel any remains of the faeces that may be lodged, towards the ex- tremity of the canal."243 MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The muscles of the upper extremity may be arranged into groups corresponding with the respective regions of the limb, as follows :— Anterior Thoracic Region.

Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of the clavicle, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process ; a second along the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, from the lower end of the sternum to the insertion of its tendon into the humerus; and connect the two by a third, carried longitudinally along the middle of the sternum. The integument and superficial fascia are to be dissected together from off the fibres of the muscle, and always in the direction of their course. For this purpose the dissector, if he have the right arm, will commence with the lower angle of the flap ; if the left, with the upper angle. He will thus expose the pectoralis major muscle in its whole extent. Pectoralis major, Pectoralis minor, Subclavius. The Pectoralis major (sterno-humeralis) arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from half the sternum its whole length, from the cartilages of all the true ribs, excepting the first and last, and from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. From this extensive origin the fibres converge to be inserted by a broad and folded tendon into the anterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. The pectoralis major admits of a division into three portions, clavicular, sternal, and costal; the two former are separated from each other by a well-marked cellular interspace; the latter is dis- tinguished not only by its origin, but also by forming a fold beneath the sternal portion, and lying behind it at its insertion. At the latter point the three portions are superimposed, the clavicular being in front, the sternal next, the costal behind; the clavicular portion being prolonged at its insertion to the lower extremity of the bicipital ridge, the costal portion to its upper end. Relations.—By its external surface with the fibres of origin of the platysma myoides, mammary gland, superficial fascia and in- tegument. By its internal surface, on the thorax, with the clavicle, sternum, costal cartilages, intercostal muscles, subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus magnus; in the axilla, with the axillary vessels and glands. By its external border with the deltoid, from which it is separated above by a cellular interspace lodging the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its lower border forms the anterior boundary of the axil- lary space. The pectoralis major is to be removed by dividing its fibres along the lower border of the clavicle, and then carrying the in- cision perpendicularly downwards, parallel to the sternum, and at about three inches from its border. Divide some loose cellular tissue, and several small branches of the thoracic arteries, and re- flect the muscle outwards. We thus bring into view a region of245 PECTORALIS MINOR. SEEEATUS MAGNUS. considerable interest, in the middle of which is situated the pec- toralis minor. The Pectoealis minoe (costo-coracoideus) arises by three digita- tions from the front and upper border of the third, fourth, and fifth rib near their cartilages ; and is inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior border and apex of the coracoid process of the scapula. It is closely united at its insertion with the coraco-brachialis. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pectoralis major and superior thoracic vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the ribs, intercostal muscles, serratus magnus, axillary space, and axillary vessels and nerves. Its upper oorder forms the lower boundary of a triangular space, bounded above by the costo-coracoid membrane, and internally by the ribs ; in this space are found the axillary vessels and nerves. The Subclavius (costo-clavicularis) arisesloj a round-tendon from the cartilage and adjacent osseous part of the first rib; it is inserted into the under surface of the clavicle as far as the coraco-clavicular ligament. This muscle is enclosed in a partial sheath by the costo- coracoid membrane, an extension of the deep cervical fascia. Relations.—By its upper surface with the clavicle. By the lower with the subclavian artery and vein and brachial plexus, which separate it from the first rib. In front with the pectoralis major, ijhe costo-coracoid membrane being interposed. Actions.—The pectoralis major draws the arm against the thorax, while its upper fibres assist the upper part of the trapezius in rais- ing the shoulder, as in supporting weights. The lower fibres depress the shoulder with the aid of the latissimus dorsi. Taking its fixed point from the shoulder, the pectoralis major assists the pectoralis minor, subclavius, and serratus magnus, in drawing up and expanding the chest. The pectoralis minor, in addition to this action, draws upon the coracoid process, and assists in rotating the scapula upon the chest. The subclavius draws the clavicle down- wards and forwards, and thereby assists in steadying the shoulder. All the muscles of this group are agents in forced respiration, but are incapable of acting in that capacity until the shoulders are fixed. Lateral Thoracic Region. Serratus magnus. The Seeeatus magnus (serratus, indented like the edge of a saw ; costo-scapularis), broad, thin, and trapezoid in shape, amesbynine fleshy serrations from the eight upper ribs, two of the serrations being attached to the second rib, and extends backwards upon the side of the chest, to be inserted into the whole length of the base of the scapula, its anterior aspect. In structure, the muscle is com- posed of three portions, superior, formed by the serrations of the first two ribs, and inserted into the inner surface of the superiorMUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 246 angle of the scapula ; middle, composed of the serrations connected with the third and fourth ribs, and inserted into the greater part of the posterior border ; inferior, consisting of the last five serra- tions, these latter indigitate with the obliquus externus and form a thick muscular fasciculus, which is inserted into the scapula near its inferior angle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pectoralis major and minor, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the ribs and intercostal muscles, to which it is connected by loose cellular tissue. Actions.—The serratus magnus is the great external inspiratory muscle, raising the ribs when the shoulders are fixed, and thereby increasing the. cavity of the chest. Acting upon the scapula it draws the shoulder forwards, as in the case of diseased lungs, where the chest has become almost fixed from apprehension of the expanding action of the respiratory muscles. Anterior Scapular Region. Subscapularis. The Subscapularis arises from the whole of the under surface of the scapula excepting the superior and inferior angle, and terminates by a broad and thick tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and by muscular fibres into the surface of bone immediately below that process. In structure the subsca- pularis is composed of eight or ten fasciculi, four or five of which arise from one side of as many aponeurotic processes attached to the ridges of the venter of the scapula ; and four or five proceed from the other side of the aponeurotic processes and from the surface of bone intervening between them. Its tendon forms part of the capsule of the joint, glides over a large bursa which separates it from the base of the coracoid process, and is lined by a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the articulation. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the serratus magnus, coraco-brachialis, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the scapula, and shoulder-joint. Action.—It rotates the head of the humerus inwards, and is a powerful defence to the joint. When the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. Posterior Scapular Region. Supra-spinatus, Teres minor, Infra-spinatus, Teres major. The Supra-spinatus muscle {supra, above; spina, the spine) arises from the supra-spinous fossa, spine of the scapula, and proper investing fascia ; and is inserted into the uppermost depression on the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; the tendon being united near its attachment with that of the infra-spinatus. The tendon cannot be seen until the acromion process is removed.INFRASPINATUS. TERES MAJOR. 247 Relations.—By its topper surface with the trapezius, clavicle, acromion, and coraco-acromial ligament. From the trapezius it is separated by a strong fascia. By its lower surface with the supra- spinous fossa, suprascapular vessels and nerve, origin of the omo- hyoid muscle, and upper part of the shoulder-joint, forming part of the capsular ligament. The Infra-spinatps (infra, beneath; spina, the spine) is covered in by a layer of tendinous fascia, which must be removed before the fibres of the muscle can be seen, the deltoid muscle having been previously turned down from its scapular origin. It arises from the whole of the infra-spinous fossa, excepting a small portion near the neck of the bone, from the spine of the scapula, and from the investing fascia; it is inserted into the middle depression of the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; its tendon being blended with that of the supra-spinatus above and the teres minor below. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, trapezius and integument. By its anterior surface with the infra-spinous fossa, supra-scapular and dorsal scapular vessels, and shoulder-joint; its tendon being lined by a prolongation from the synovial membrane. By its upper border it is in relation with the spine of the scapula ; and by the lower with the teres major and minor, being closely united with the latter. The Teres minor (teres, round) arises from the posterior surface of the lower border of the scapula for about the middle third of its extent; it is connected with the lower border of the preceding muscle, and is inserted into the inferior depression of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The tendons of the three preceding muscles, with that of the subscapularis, are in immediate contact with the shoulder-joint, and form part of its ligamentous capsule, thereby preserving the solidity of the articulation. They are therefore the structures most frequently ruptured in dislocation of the head of the humerus. Relations.—By its posterior surf ace with the deltoid, and integu- ment. By its anterior surface with the inferior border and part of the dorsum of the scapula, dorsalis scapulae vessels, scapular head of the triceps, and shoulder-joint. By its upper border with the infra-spinatus; by the lower with the teres major, and long head of the triceps. The Teres maj^r muscle arises from the dorsal surface of the inferior angle of the scapula, and from its inferior border ; it is inserted into the posterior bicipital ridge of the humerus, imme- diately behind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. At its origin this muscle is covered by the latissimus dorsi, but the latter shortly afterwards curves around its lower border and becomes placed in front: the two tendons at their insertion, one lying behind the other, are separated by a bursa. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the latissimus dorsi, scapular head of the triceps and integument. By its anterior surface248 ACROMIAL REG-ION. with the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, coraco-brachialis, short head of the biceps, axillary vessels, and nerves of the brachial plexus. By its upper border it is in relation with the teres minor, from which it is separated by the scapular head of the triceps; and, by the lovjer, forms, with the latissimus dorsi, the lower and posterior border of the axilla. A large triangular space exists between the two teres muscles, which is divided into two minor spaces by the long head of the triceps. Actions.—The supra-spinatus raises the arm from the side ; but feebly, from the disadvantageous direction of its force. The infra- spinatus and teres minor are rotators of the head of the humerus outwards. The most important use of these three muscles is the protection of the joint, and defence against displacement of the head of the humerus, in which action they co-operate with the subscapularis. The teres major combines, with the latissimus dorsi, in rotating the arm inwards, and at the same time carrying it towards the side, and somewhat backwards. . * A cromial Region. Deltoideus. The Deltoideus (A, delta ; eldos, resemblance ; attollens humeri; sub-acromio-humeralis) is the large triangular muscle which forms the convexity of the shoulder ; it arises from the outer third of the clavicle, from the acromion process, and from the whole length of the spine of the scapula. The fibres from this broad origin converge to the middle of the outer side of the humerus, where they are inserted into a rough triangular elevation. In structure the deltoideus is composed of seven fasciculi, four of which are fleshy above and tendinous below ; and three tendinous above and fleshy below. To bring the muscles beneath it into view, the deltoid must be cut away from its origin, and turned down ; in so doing, a large bursa will be seen between its under surface and the head of the humerus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the brachial fascia, a few fibres of the platysma myoides, the superficial fascia, and integument. By its deep surface with the shoulder-joint (from which it is separated by a thin tendinous fascia and a synovial bursa), the coraco-acromial ligament, coracoid process, pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, both heads of the biceps, tendon of the pectoralis major, tendon of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, teres major, scapular and external head of the triceps, circumflex vessels anterior and posterior, and humerus. By its anterior border with the external border of the pectoralis major, from which it is separated by a cellular interspace, lodging the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its posterior249 CORACO-BRACHIALIS.—BICEPS BRACHII. border is thin and tendinous above, where it is connected with the aponeurotic covering of the infra-spinatus muscle, and thick below. Actions.—The deltoid is the elevator muscle of the arm in a direct line, and, by means of its extensive origin, it can carry the arm forwards or backwards so as to range with the hand a con- siderable segment of a large circle. The arm, raised by the deltoid, is an illustration of a lever of the third power, so common in the animal machine, by which velocity is gained at the expense of power. In this lever, the weight (hand) is at one extremity, the fulcrum (glenoid cavity) at the opposite end, the power (insertion of the muscle) between the two, but nearer to the fulcrum than to the weight. Anterior Humeral Region. Coraco-brachialis, Biceps brachii, Brachialis anticus. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed, on the removal of the integument and fascia from the anterior half of the upper arm, and the clearing away of the cellular tissue. The Coraco-brachialis, a name suggestive of its points of origin and insertion, arises from the apex of the coracoid process in com- mon with the short head of the biceps ; and is inserted into a rough line on the inner side of the middle of the humerus. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deltoid and pec- toralis major. By its posterior surface with the shoulder-joint, hu- merus, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, short head of the triceps, and anterior circumflex vessels. By its internal border with the axillary and brachial vessels and nerves, particularly with the median and musculo-cutaneous nerve, by the latter of which it is pierced. By the external border with the short head of the biceps and brachialis anticus. The Biceps brachii (bis—KecpaXal, two heads ; flexor radii) arises by two tendons, one, the short head, from the coracoid process in common with the coraco-brachialis ; the other, the long head, from the upper part of the glenoid cavity, where it is continuous with the glenoid ligament. The muscle is inserted by a rounded tendon into the back part of the tubercle of the radius. The long head, a long slender tendon, passes through the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint enclosed in a sheath of the synovial membrane ; after leaving the cavity of the joint, it is lodged in the deep groove that separates the two tuberosities of the humerus, the bicipital groove. A small synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion, and the tubercle of the radius. At the bend of the elbow, the tendon of the biceps gives off from its inner side a ten- dinous band, which protects the brachial artery, and is continuous with the fascia of the forearm. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deltoid, pectoralis major, superficial and deep fascia, and integument. By its poste-ANTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. 250 Fig. 125. rior surface the short head rests on the subscapularis, from which it is separated by a bursa. In the rest of its extent the muscle is in relation with the humerus, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and brachialis anticus; from the latter it is separated by the musculocuta- neous nerve. By its inner border with the coraco-brachialis, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve; the brachial vessels crossing its tendon at the bend of the elbow. By its outer border, with the deltoid and supinator longus. The Brachialis anticus (humero- cubitalis) is a broad muscle covering the whole of the anterior surface of the lower part of the humerus ; it arises by two fleshy serrations, which embrace the insertion of the deltoid, from the anterior surface of the hu- merus, and from the inner intermus- cular septum. Its fibres converge to be inserted into the coronoid process of the ulna, between two processes of the flexor digitorum profundus. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the biceps, musculocuta- neous nerve, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve. By its posterior surface with the humerus, anterior ligament of the elbow-joint, and in- termuscular aponeurosis. The latter separates it from the triceps. By its external border with the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, musculo-spiral nerve, and recurrent radial artery. By its internal border with the intermuscular aponeurosis (which separates it from the triceps and ulnar nerve), and with the pronator radii teres. Actions.—The coraco-brachialis draws the humerus inwards, and assists in flexing it upon the scapula. The biceps and brachi- alis anticus are flexors of the forearm, and the former a supinator. The brachialis anticus is a powerful protector of the elbow-joint. * Muscles of the anterior aspect of the upper arm. 1. Coracoid process of the scapula. 2.

'Posterior Humeral Region. Triceps brachii. Dissection. —Remove the integument and fascia from the rior aspect of the upper arm. The Triceps brachii (rpeis Ke<pa\al, three heads ; triceps ex- tensor cubiti) arises by three heads ; external, middle, and internal. The external head (anconeus externus) proceeds from the whole length of the external and posterior aspect of the humerus, from the insertion of the teres minor at the greater tuberosity to the external condyle, and also from the external intermuscular septum. The in- . ternal head (anconseus internus) arises from the inner and posterior aspect of the humerus, from the insertion of the teres major to the internal condyle, and from the in- ternal intermuscular septum. The middle or long head (anconeus longus) arises from the lower part of the h;ead and adjoining part of the border of the scapula, to the extent of about an inch. The three heads, passing downwards in dif- ferent directions, unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted into the olecranon process of the ulna, and sends an expansion to the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa is situated between the tendon of the muscle and the upper part of the olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and major, and divides the tri- angular interspace of those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The trian- gular space is bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps ; it gives passage to the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins. The quad- rangular space is bounded on three sides by the three preceding * Posterior view of the upper arm, and triceps muscle. 1. External head. 2. Long or scapular head. 3.

Through the latter space pass the posterior circumflex artery and veins, and circumflex nerve. Beneath the lower part of the triceps are two small fasciculi arising from the humerus, and descending one on either side of the fossa of the olecranon to be inserted into the capsule of the elbow- joint. These have been named sub-anconeus, they are analogous to the sub-crureus. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the deep and super- ficial fascia and integument. By its anterior surface with the superior profunda artery, inusculo-spiral nerve, humerus, inter- muscular aponeurosis which separates it from the brachialis anticus, and elbow-joint. The scapular head is in relation posteriorly with the deltoid and teres minor; anteriorly with the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi ; and externally with the posterior circumflex vessels and nerve. Actions.—The triceps brachii is an extensor of the forearm. Anterior Brachial Region. Superficial layer. Pronator radii teres, Flexor sublimis digitorum, Flexor carpi radialis, Flexor carpi ulnaris. Palmaris longus, Dissection.—These muscles are brought into view by making an incision through the integument along the middle line of the fore- arm, crossing each extremity by a transverse incision, and turning aside the flaps. The superficial and deep fascia are then to be removed. . , The Pronator radii teres arises by two heads : one from the inner condyle of the humerus, fascia of the forearm, and intermus- cular septum ; the other from the coronoid process of the ulna ; the median nerve passing between them. Its tendon is flat, and is inserted into the middle third of the oblique ridge of the radius. The two heads of this muscle are best examined by cutting through that which arises from the inner condyle, and turning it aside. The second head will then be seen with the median nerve lying across it. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and bre- vior, radial artery and veins, and radial nerve. By its posterior surf ace with the brachialis anticus, flexor sublimis digitorum, ulnar artery and veins, and the median nerve after it has passed between the two heads of the muscle. By its upper border it forms the inner boundary of the triangular space, in which the termination of the brachial artery is situated. By its lower border it is in relation with the flexor carpi radialis.253 FLEXOR SUBLIMIS DIGITORUM. Fig. 127.* The Flexor carpi radialis arises froaa tlie inner condyle, deep fascia and intermuscular septa. Its tendon passes through a groove in the trapezium bone, to he inserted into the base of the metacarpal hone of the index finger. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, and at the wrist with the tendinous canal through whichits tendon passes.

By its outer border with the pronator radii teres, radial artery and veins. By its inner border with the palmaris longus. The tendon is surrounded by synovial membrane, where it plays through the tendinous canal of the wrist. The Palmaris longus is a small muscle which arises from the inner condyle, deep fascia, and intermus- cular septa. Its tendon pierces the deep fascia and crosses the annular ligament to be inserted into the palmar fascia. Relations. —By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the forearm.

The median nerve and ulnar artery pass between its heads. It divides into four tendons, which pass beneath the annular ligament, and are inserted into the base of the second phalanges of the fingers, splitting at their termination to give passage to the tendons of the deep flexor; hence its designation, perforatus. In the thecse of the fingers several small tendinous fasciculi are found, which pass from the phalanges to the edges of the tendons; these .have been termed the vinculo, accessoria. Relations.—In the forearm; by its anterior surface with the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the deep fascia. By its posterior surface with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, ulnar artery, ■veins, and nerve, and median nerve. This muscle frequently sends a fasciculus to the flexor longus pollicis or flexor profundus. In the hand : its tendons, after passing beneath the annular ligament, are in relation superficially with the superficial palmar arch, and palmar fascia; and deeply with the tendons of the deep flexor and lumbricales. The Flexor carpi ulnaris arises by two heads, one from the inner condyle and intermuscular septa, the other from the olecranon and by means of a strong aponeurosis from two-thirds of the inner border of the ulna. Its tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, with which it is closely united superiorly. By its pos- terior surface with the flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor profundus, pronator quadratus, ulnar artery, veins, and nerve. By its radial border with the palmaris longus, and in the lower third of the forearm, the ulnar vessels and nerve. The ulnar nerve, and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery, pass between its two heads of origin. Deep layer. Flexor profundus digitorum, Flexor longus pollicis, Pronator quadratus. Dissection.—This group is brought into view by removing the flexor sublimis, and drawing aside the pronator radii teres. The Flexor profundus digitorum (perforans) arises from the upper two-thirds of the ulna, its anterior and inner surface and posterior border, from the inner side of the olecranon, where it is connected with the aponeurotic expansion of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and from the ulnar half of the interosseous membrane. At the middle of the forearm it divides into four tendons which pass beneath the annular ligament, and along the fingers, between the two slips of the tendons of the flexor sublimis, to be inserted into the base of the last phalanges. In the groove of the carpus the255 FLEXOR LONGUS POLLICIS. tendons are enclosed in a synovial membrane and the three outer tendons communicate with each other by means of small slips, the tendon of the index finger remaining distinct. In the hand, the tendons give origin to the lnmbricales muscles, and on the second phalanges, are retained in position by two little tendinous slips, the vincula Fig. 128.* accessoria. | Relations.—In the forearm : by its \ anterior surface with the flexor sub- \ limis digitorum, flexor carpi ulnaris, median nerve, and ulnar artery, veins, and nerve.

By its radial border with the flexor longus pollicis, the anterior interosseous artery and nerve being interposed. By its ulnar border with the flexor carpi ulnaris. In the hand : its tendons are in rela- tion superficially with the tendons of the superficial flexor; and deeply with the interpssei, adductor pollicis, and deep palmar arch. The Flexor longus pollicis arises from the anterior surface of the ra- dius for two-thirds of its extent, and from one-half the interosseous mem- brane. Its tendon passes beneath the annular ligament to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the flexor sublimis digito- rum, flexor carpi radialis, supinator longus, and radial artery and veins.

If the tendons of the last two muscles be drawn aside or divided, the third muscle of this group will be brought into "view, lying across the lower part of the two bones. The Pronator quadratus (cubito-radialis) arises from the ante- rior and inner side of the ulna; and is inserted into the front of the radius. This muscle occupies about the lower fourth of the two bones, is broad at its origin, and narrower at its insertion. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the tendons of the supinator longus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor longus pollicis, flexor profundus digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris, radial artery and veins, and ulnar artery, veins, and nerve. By its posterior sur- face with the radius, ulna, and interosseous membrane. Actions.—The pronator radii teres and pronator quadratus rotate the radius upon the ulna, and render the hand prone. The re- maining muscles are flexors: two flexors of the wrist, flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris; two of the fingers, flexor sublimis and pro- fundus, the former flexing the second phalanges, the latter the last, one flexor of the last phalanx of the thumb, flexor longus pollicis. The palmaris longus is primarily a tensor of the palmar fascia, and secondly a flexor of the wrist and forearm. Extensor communis digitorum, Dissection.—The integument is to be divided and turned aside, and the fascia removed in the same manner as for the anterior brachial region. The Supinator longus (brachio-radialis) is placed along the radial border of the forearm. It arises from the external condy-* loid ridge of the humerus, nearly as high as the insertion of the deltoid, and from the intermuscular septum; passes forward to the anterior aspect of the elbow joint, and descends the forearm to be inserted into the base of the styloid process of the radius.

This muscle must be divided through the middle, and the two ends turned aside to expose the next muscle. The Extensor carpi radialis longior arises from the external condyloid ridge, below the preceding, and from the intermuscular septum. Its tendon passes through a groove in the radius immediately behind the styloid process, to be in- serted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger.

By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, tendon of the pronator radii teres, radius, and wrist-joint. By its ulnar border with the extensor communis digitorum. The Extensor communis digitorum arises from the external condyle by a common tendon with the preceding and two following muscles, from the intermuscular septa, and deep fascia ; and di- vides into four tendons, which are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers. At the metacarpo-phalangeal arti- culation each tendon becomes narrow and thick, and sends a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint. It then spreads out, and receiving the tendon of the lumbricalis and some tendinous fasciculi from the interossei, forms a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole posterior aspect of the finger. At the first phalangeal joint the aponeurosis divides into three slips. The middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral portions are continued onwards at each side of the joint, to be inserted into the last. Little oblique tendinous slips connect the tendon of the ring with those of the middle and little finger as they cross the back of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the forearm and hand, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii, extensor secundi internodii, extensor indicis, posterior interosseous artery and nerve, wrist-joint, meta- carpal bones, interossei muscles, and phalanges. By its radial border with the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. By the ulnar border with the extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The Extensor minimi digiti (auricularis) is an off-set from the extensor communis, with which it is connected by means of a ten- dinous slip. Passing down to the inferior extremity of the ulna, it traverses a distinct fibrous sheath, and at the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation unites with the tendon derived from the common ex- tensor. The common tendon then spreads out into a broad expan- sion which divides into three slips to be inserted as in the other fingers into the last two phalanges. It is to this muscle that the little finger owes its power of separate extension ; and, being called into action when the point of the finger is introduced into the meatus of the ear, for the purpose of removing unpleasant sensa- tions or producing titillation, the muscle was called by the old writers "auricularis." The Extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the external condyle by the common tendon, from the border of the ulna, and from the deep fascia. Its tendon passes through the posterior groove in the lower extremity of the ulna, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger.ANCONEUS. EXTENSOR OSSIS METACARPI POLLIC1S. 259 Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor secundi internodii, extensor indicis, ulna, and wrist-joint. By its radial border it is in relation with the extensor communis digi- torum and extensor minimi digiti, and by the ulnar border with the anconeus. The Anconeus (anconeus parvus, vel quartus) is a small trian- gular muscle, having the appearance of being a continuation of the triceps ; it arises from the outer condyle, and is inserted into the olecranon and triangular surface of the upper extremity of the ulna. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a strong tendinous aponeurosis derived from the triceps. By its deep surface with the elbow-joint, orbicular ligament, and slightly with the supinator brevis. Deep layer.—Supinator brevis, Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, Extensor primi internodii pollicis, Extensor secundi internodii pollicis, Extensor indicis. Dissection.—The muscles of the superficial layer should be re- moved in order to bring the deep group completely into view. The Supinator brevis cannot be seen in its entire extent, until the l-adial extensors of the carpus are divided from their origin. It arises from the external condyle, from the external lateral and orbicular ligament, and from the ulna, and winds around the upper part of the radius, to be inserted into the upper third of its oblique line. The posterior interosseous artery and nerve perforate the lower border of this muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pronator radii teres, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, radial artery and veins, musculo-spiral nerve, radial and posterior intei-osseous nerve. By its deep surface with the elbow-joint and ligaments, interosseous membrane, and radius. The Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (abductor pollicis longus) is placed immediately below the supinator brevis. It arises from the ulna, interosseous membrane, and radius, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its tendon passes through the groove immediately in front of the styloid pro- cess of the radius. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor minimi digiti, extensor communis digitorum, fascia of the forearm and annular ligament.

It is crossed by branches of the posterior interosseous artery and nerve. The Extensor primi internodii pollicis (extensor pollicis brevis vel minor), the smallest of the muscles in this layer, arises from the interos- seous membrane and radius, and passes through the groove with the extensor ossis metacarpi, to be in- serted into the base of the first pha- lanx of the thumb. Relations.—The same as the pre- ceding muscle, with the exception of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The muscle accompanies the extensor ossis metacarpi. The Extensor secundi internodii pollicis (extensor pollicis longus vel major) arises from the ulna, and inter- osseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a separate groove in the ra- dius, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its external surface, the same as the extensor ossis meta- carpi. By its deep surface with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, wrist-joint, radial artery, and meta- carpal bone of the thumb. The muscle is placed between the extensor primi internodii and extensor indicis. The Extensor indicis (indicator) arises from the ulna, as high up as the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and inferiorly from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes beneath the posterior annular ligament to be inserted into the aponeurosis of the common extensor tendon of the index finger. Relations.—The same as the preceding muscle, with the excep- tion of the hand, where the tendon rests on the metacarpal bone * Deep layer of muscles of the posterior aspect of the forearm. 1.

The tendons of the extensors, as of the flexor muscles of the fore- arm, are provided with synovial bursse as they pass beneath the annular ligament: those of the back of the wrist have separate sheaths, formed by the posterior annular ligament. Actions.— The anconeus is associated in its action with the triceps extensor cubiti: it assists in extending the forearm on the arm. The supinator longus and brevis effect the supination of the forearm, and antagonize the two pronators. The extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and extensor carpi ulnaris, extend the wrist in opposition to the two flexors of the carpus. The extensor communis digitorum restores the fingers to the straight position after they have been flexed by the two flexors, sublimis and profundus. The extensor ossis metacarpi, primi internodii, and secundi internodii pollicis, are the special extensors of the thumb, and serve to balance the actions of the flexor ossis metacarpi, flexor brevis, and flexor longus pollicis. The extensor indicis produces extension of the index finger, and is therefore named "indicator," and the extensor minimi digiti supplies that finger with the power of exerting a distinct extension. MUSCLES -OF THE HAND. Radial or Thenar Region. Abductor pollicis, Flexor brevis pollicis, Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens), Adductor pollicis. Dissection.—The hand is best dissected by making an incision along the middle of the palm, from the wrist to the base of the middle finger, and crossing it at each extremity by a transverse incision, then turning aside the flaps of integument. For exposing the muscles of the radial region, the removal of the integument and fascia on the radial side will be sufficient. The Abductor pollicis (brevis) is a small thin muscle, which arises from the trapezium bone and annular ligament. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external portion of the palmar fascia; by its deep surface with the flexor ossis metacarpi. At its inner side it is separated by a narrow cellular interspace from the flexor brevis pollicis. This muscle must be divided from its origin, and turned aside, in order to see the next. The Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens pollicis) arises from the trapezium and annular ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the abductor pollicis. By its deep surface with the trapezo-metacarpal articulation and metacarpal bone. Internally with the flexor brevis pollicis.

The Flexor bee vis pollicis consists of two portions, between which lies the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The external portion arises from the trapezium and annular ligament; the internal portion from Fig. 131.* the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, having a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to pro- tect the joint.

By its external swr/acewith the flexor ossis metacarpi and metacarpal bone. By its inner surface with the tendons of the long flexor muscles and first lumbricalis. The Adductor pol- licis is a triangular muscle ; it arises by a broad origin from the metacarpal bone of the middle finger; the fibres converge to its insertion into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, where it is united with the inner head of the flexor brevis. * Muscles of the hand. 1.

Ulnar or Hypothenar Region. Palmaris brevis, Flexor brevis minimi digiti, Abductor minimi digiti, Adductor ossis metacarpi. Dissection.—Turn aside the ulnar flap of integument from the palm of the hand; in doing this, a small subcutaneous muscle, the palmaris brevis, will be exposed. After examining this muscle, remove it with the deep fascia, in order to bring into view the muscles of the little finger. The Palmaris brevis is a thin plane of muscular fibres about an inch in width, which arises from the annular ligament and palmar fascia, and passes transversely inwards to be inserted into the in- tegument of the inner border of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fat and integu- ment of the inner portion of the palm. By its deep surface with the ulnar portion of the palmar fascia, which separates it from the ulnar artery, veins, and nerve, and from the muscles of the inner border of the hand. The Abductok minimi digiti is a small tapering muscle which arises from the pisiform bone, where it is continuous with the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger, and into the expansion of the extensor tendon. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the internal portion of the deep fascia and palmaris brevis; by its deep surface with the adductor ossis metacarpi and metacarpal bone. By its inner border with the flexor brevis minimi digiti. The Flexor brevis minimi digiti is a small muscle arising ■ from the unciform bone and annular ligament, and inserted into the base of the first phalanx. It is sometimes wanting. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the internal portion of the palmar fascia, and palmaris brevis. By its deep surface with the adductor ossis metacarpi and metacarpal bone.

Lumbricales, Interossei palmares, Interossei dorsales. The Lumbricales, four in number, are accessories to the deep flexor muscle. They arise from the tendons of the deep flexor ; the first and second from the palmar side, the third from the ulnar, the fourth from the radial side; and are inserted into the aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendons on the radial side of the fingers. The third, or that of the tendon of the ring finger, sometimes bifur- cates, at other times it is inserted wholly into the extensor tendon of the middle finger. Relations.—In the palm of the hand with the flexor tendons; at their insertion, with the tendons of the interossei and the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. The Palmar interossei, three in number, are placed upon the metacarpal bones, rather than between them. They arise from the base of the metacarpal bone of one finger, and are inserted into the base of the first phalanx and aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendon of the same finger. The first belongs to the index finger; the second, to the ring finger; the third, to the little finger; the middle finger being omitted. Relations.—By their palmar surface with the flexor tendons and deep muscles in the palm of the hand. By their dorsal surface with the dorsal interossei. On one side with the metacarpal bone, on the other with the corresponding dorsal interosseous muscle. Dorsal interossei.—Turning to the dorsum of the hand, the four dorsal interossei (bicipites) are seen in the four spaces between the metacarpal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, and arise by two heads, from adjoining sides of the bases of the metacarpal bones. They are inserted into the base of the first phalanges, and into the aponeurosis of the extensor tendons. The first is inserted into the index finger, and from its use is called abductor indicis; the second and third are inserted into the middle finger, compensating its exclusion from the palmar group; the fourth is attached to the ring finger ; so that each finger is pro- vided with two interossei, with the exception of the little finger, as may be shown by means of a table, thus :— Index finger \ me dofal (aMuctor indicis)> v a { one palmar. Middle finger, two dorsal. Ring finger j one dofsa1' ° u J ( one palmar. Little finger, remaining palmar.265 ACTIONS OF MUSCLES. Relations.—By their dorsal surface with a thin aponeurosis, the fascia dorsalis profunda, which separates them from the tendons on the dorsum of the hand. By their palmar surface with the muscles and tendons in the palm of the hand. By one side with the meta- carpal bone; by the other with the corresponding palmar inter- osseous. The abductor indicis is in relation by its palmar surface, with the adductor pollicis and flexor brevis pollicis. The radial artery passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (abductor indicis) ; and the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Actions.—The actions of the muscles of the hand are expressed in their names. Those of the radial region belong to the thumb, and provide for three of its movements, abduction, adduction, and. flexion. The ulnar group, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger, and the interossei are abductors and adductors of the several fingers. The lumbricales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexors ; they were called by the earlier anatomists Jidicinii, i.e. fiddlers' muscles, from an idea that they might effect the rapid movements by which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. In relation to the axis of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are abductors, the three palmar adductors. It will therefore be seen that each finger is provided with its proper adductor and abductor, two flexors, and (with the exception of the middle and ring finger) two extensors. The thumb has moi-eover a flexor and extensor of the metacarpal bone; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone (opponens) without an extensor.

Dissection.—The subject being turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the pubes to support the pelvis, tbe student com- mences the dissection of this region, by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous process ; or vice versd, if he be on the left side. He then makes an incision from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, to the apex of the trochanter major, this marks the upper border of the gluteus maximus; and a third incision from the apex of the coccyx along the fleshy margin of the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to the outer side of the thigh, about four inches below the apex of the trochanter major. He then reflects the in- tegument, superficial fascia, and deep fascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus maximus, following rigidly the course of its fibres ; and having exposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and superficial fascia from off269 GLUTEUS MAXIMUS.—GLUTEUS MEDIUS. the deep fascia which binds down the gluteus medius, the other portion of the region. The Gluteus maximus (yXovrbs, nates; sacro-fenioralis) is the thick, fleshy mass of muscle, of a trapezoid shape, which forms the convexity of the nates. In structure, it is coarse, being made up of large fibres, which are collected into fasciculi, and these again into distinct muscular masses, separated by deep cellular furrows. It arises from the posterior fifth of the crest and external surface of the ilium, from the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and from the great sacro-ischiatic ligament. It passes obliquely out- wards and downwards, to be inserted into the rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea aspera, and is continuous by means of its tendon with the fascia lata covering the outer side of the thigh, and with the external intermuscular ligament. Several bursse are situated between this muscle and subjacent parts : one upon the tuberosity of the ischium, one between its tendon and the trochanter major, and one between it and the tendon of the vastus externus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a thin aponeurotic fascia, which separates it from the superficial fascia and integument, and near its insertion, with the vastus externus. By its deep sur- face with the gluteus medius, pyriformis, gemelli, obturator in- ternus, quadratus femoris, sacro-ischiatic foramina, great sacro- ischiatic ligament, tuberosity of the ischium, semi-membranosus, semi-tendinosus, biceps, and adductor magnus ; gluteal vessels and nerves, ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. By its upper border it overlaps the gluteus medius ; and by the lower border forms the lower margin of the nates. The gluteus maximus must be turned down from its origin, in order to bring the next muscles into view. The Gxuteus medius is placed in front of, rather than beneath the gluteus maximus ; and is covered in by a process of the deep fascia, which is very thick and dense. It arises from the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for four-fifths its length, from the surface of bone between that border and the superior curved line of the dor- sum ilii, and from the thick fascia above mentioned. Its fibres converge to the outer part of the trochanter major, into which its tendon is inserted. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the tensor vaginae femoris, gluteus maximus, and its own proper fascia. By its deep surface with the gluteus minimus and gluteal vessels and nerves.

This muscle should now be removed from its origin and turned down, to expose the next, which is situated beneath it. The Gluteus minimus Fig. 132.* is a radiated muscle aris- ing from the surface of the dorsum ilii, between the superior and inferior curved line; its fibres converge to the anterior border of- the trochanter major, into which it is inserted by- means of arounded tendon. There is no distinct sepa- ration between the gluteus medius and minimus an- teriorly. Relations.—By its su- perficial surface with the gluteus medius, and glu- teal vessels. By its deep surface with the ilium, long tendon of the rectus femoris, and capsule of the hip-joint. A bursa is in- terposed between its tendon and the trochanter. The Pyriformis (pyrum, a pear, i. e. pear-shaped; iliacus externus) arises from the anterior surface of the sacrum, by three little slips interposed between the anterior sacral foramina from the first to the fourth, and from the adjoining surface of the ilium. It passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the posterior border of the trochanter major. Relations.—By its superficial or external surface with the sacrum and gluteus maximus. By its deep or pelvic surface with the rectum, sacral plexus of nerves, branches of the internal iliac artery, great sacro-ischiatic notch, and capsule of the hip-joint.

The Gemellus superior (gemellus, double, twin) is a small slip of muscle situated immediately below the pyriformis ; it arises from the spine of the ischium, and is inserted into the upper border of the tendon of the obturator internus, and into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. The gemellus superior is not unfrequently wanting. , Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. By its deep surface With the pelvis and capsule of the hip-joint. The Obturator internus arises from the inner surface of the anterior wall of the pelvis, being attached to the margin of bone around the obturator foramen-and to the obturator membrane. It passes out of the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a flattened tendon into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. The lesser sacro-ischiatic notch, over which this muscle plays as through a pulley, is faced with cartilage, and provided with a synovial bursa to facilitate its movements. The tendon of the obturator is bordered above and below, by the gemelli muscles (hence their names), which are inserted into the sides of its tendon, and appear to be auxiliaries or superadded portions, external origins in fact of the obturator internus. Relations.—By its superficial or posterior surface with the in- ternal pudic vessels and nerve, the obturator fascia, which sepa- rates it from the levator ani and viscera of the pelvis, the sacro- ischiatic ligaments, gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves.

To expose the muscle fully, it is necessary to dissect it on the anterior part of the thigh, after the removal of the pectineus, adductor longus and adductor brevis. The Obturator externus muscle (obturare, to stop up) arises from the obturator membrane and from the surface of the bone immediately surrounding it anteriorly, viz., from the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; its tendon passes outwards behind the neck of the femur, to be inserted with the external rotator muscles, into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. Relations.—By its superficial or anterior surface with the tendon of the psoas and iliacus, pectineus, adductor, brevis and magnus, obturator vessels and nerve. By its deep ox posterior surface with the obturator membrane and margin of bone which surrounds it, the lower part of the capsule of the hip-joint and quadratus femoris. The Quai>ratus eemoris (square-shaped) arises from the external border of the tuberosity of the ischium; and is inserted into a rough line on the posterior border of the trochanter major, which is thence named linea quadrati. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves. By its anterior surface with the tendon of the obturator externus and trochanter minor, a synovial bursa often separating it from the latter. By its upper border with the gemellus inferior ; and by the lower border with the adductor magnus. Actions.—The glutei muscles are abductors of the thigh, when they take their fixed point from the pelvis. Taking their fixed point from the thigh, they steady the pelvis on the head of the femur ; this action is peculiarly obvious in standing on one leg : they assist also in carrying the leg forward, in progression. The gluteus minimus being attached to the anterior border of the tro- chanter major, rotates the limb slightly inwards. The gluteus medius and maximus, from their insertion into the posterior aspect of the bone, rotate the limb outwards ; the latter is, moreover, a tensor of the fascia of the thigh. The other muscles rotate the limb outwards, everting the knee and foot ; hence they are named external rotators. Anterior Femoral Region.

Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of Poupart's liga- ment, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the spine of the pubes; and a second, from the middle of the preceding, down the inner side of the thigh, and across the inner condyle of the femur to the head of the tibia, where it may be bounded by a transverse incision.

After the deep fascia has been well considered, it is likewise to be removed, by dissecting it off in the course of the fibres of the muscles. As it might not be con- venient to the junior student to ex- pose so large a surface at once as ordered in this dissection, the ver- tical incision may be crossed by one or two transverse incisions, as may be deemed most proper.' The Tensor vagina eemoris (stretcher of the5 sheath of the thigh) is a short flat muscle, situated on the outer side of the hip. It arises from the crest of the ilium, near its anterior superior spinous process, and is inserted between two layers of the fascia lata at about one-fourth down the thigh.

This expansion covers in the insertion of the tendons of the gra- cilis and semitendinosus muscle.

By its expanded insertion with the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, a synovial bursa being interposed. At the knee-joint its posterior border is in re- lation with the internal saphenous vein. At the upper third of the thigh the sartorius forms, with the lower border of the adductor longus, an isosceles triangle (Scarpa's triangular space), whereof the base corresponds with Poupart's ligament. A perpendicular line, drawn from the middle of the base to the apex of this triangle, immediately overlies the femoral artery with its sheath. The Rectus femoris (straight) is fusiform in shape and bipenni- form in the disposition of its fibres. It arises by two round tendons, one from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, the other from the upper lip of the acetabulum ; and is inserted by a broad and strong tendon into the upper border of the patella. It is more correct to consider the patella as a sesamoid bone, developed within the tendon of the rectus ; and the ligamentum patellae as the con- tinuation of the tendon to its insertion into the tubercle of the tibia. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus medius, psoas and iliacus, sartorius ; and for the lower three-fourths of its extent with the fascia lata. By its deep surface with the capsule of the hip-joint, external circumflex vessels, crureus, vastus internus and externus. The rectus must now be divided through its middle, and the two ends turned aside, to bring clearly into view the next muscles. The three next muscles are generally considered collectively under the name of triceps extensor cruris. Adopting this view, the muscle surrounds the whole of the femur, excepting the rough line (linea aspera), at its posterior aspect. Its division into three parts is not well defined; the fleshy mass upon each side being distinguished by the names of vastus internus and externus, the middle portion by that of crureus. The Vastus externus (extensor cruris externus) narrow below and broad above, arises from the base of the trochanter major, the outer surface of the femur, outer lip of the linea aspera, and inter- muscular fascia ; it passes down to be inserted, into the outer border of the patella, or rather, by means of the ligamentum patellae, into the tubercle of the tibia conjointly with the rectus and two follow- ing muscles. Relations.—By its superficial surf 'ace with the fascia lata, rectus, biceps, semi-membranosus, and gluteus'maximus, a synovial bursa being interposed between it and the latter. By its deep surface with the crureus and femur.275 INTERNAL FEMORAL REGION. The Vastus internus (extensor cruris internus), broad below and narrow, above, arises from the anterior intertrochanteric line, inner surface of the femur, inner lip of the linea aspera and intermuscular fascia, and is inserted into the inner border of the patella. By its mesial border it is blended with the crureus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the psoas and iliacus, rectus, sartorius, femoral artery and vein and saphenous nerve, pectineus, adductor longus, brevis, and magnus, and fascia lata. By its deep surface with the crureus and femur. The Crureus (crus, the leg), arises from the anterior intertro- chanteric line and anterior surface of the femur to within two inches of the patella. It is continuous by its inner border with the vastus internus, and is inserted into the upper border of the patella ; its tendon occupying its cutaneous aspect. When the crureus is divided from its insertion, a small muscle is seen upon the lower part of the femur ; it generally consists of two fasciculi, external and internal, which are inserted into the pouch of synovial membrane that extends upwards from the knee-joint, behind the patella ; and is named, from its situation, sub-crureus. It would seem to be intended to support the synovial membrane. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external circum- flex vessels, rectus, vastus internus and externus. By its deep surface with the femur, sub-crureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Actions.—The tensor vaginse femoris renders the fascia lata tense, and slightly inverts the limb. The sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, and, continuing to act, the thigh upon the pelvis, at the same time carrying the leg across that of the opposite side, into the position in which tailors sit ; hence its name. Taking its fixed point from below, it assists the extensor muscles in steadying the leg, for the support of the trunk. The other four muscles have been collectively named quadriceps extensor, from their similarity of action. They extend the leg upon the thigh, and obtain a great increase of power by their attachment to the patella, which acts as a fulcrum. Taking their fixed point from the tibia, they steady the femur upon the leg, and the rectus, being attached to the pelvis, serves to balance the trunk upon the lower extremity. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by the removal of the inner flap of integument recommended in the dissection of the an- terior femoral region.

The Iliacus internus is a flat radiated muscle. It arises from the fossa of the ilium, the internal lip of the crest, and anterior border of the bone ; and after escaping beneath the crural arch and joining the tendon of the psoas, is inserted into the trochanter minor of the femur. A few fibres of this muscle are derived from the base of the sacrum, and others from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. Theile, with several other anatomists, regards the iliacus internus and psoas magnus as a single muscle arising by two heads ; it has no proper tendon, its muscular fibres being inserted into that of the psoas. He describes the combined muscle under the name of flexor femoris. Relations.—By its anterior surface, within the pelvis, with the external cutaneous nerve and iliac fascia, which latter separates it from the peritoneum, on the right from the caecum, and on the left from the sigmoid flexure of the colon ; externally to the pelvis, with the fascia lata, rectus, and sartorius. By its 'posterior sur- face with the iliac fossa, margin of the pelvis, and capsule of the hip-joint, a synovial bursa of large size being interposed. This bursa sometimes communicates with the synovial membrane of the ilio-femoral articulation. By its inner border, with the psoas magnus and crural nerve. The Psoas magnus (\pba, lumbus, a loin), situated by the side of the vertebral column in the loins, is a long fusiform muscle. It arises from the bodies and bases of transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae. It also-takes its origin from the intervertebral substance, and from a series of tendinous arches attached to the vertebrae, and intended for the protection of the lumbar vessels and branches of the sympathetic nerve in their pas- sage between the muscle and the bone. From this extensive origin the muscle passes along the margin of the brim of the pelvis, and beneath Poupart's ligament, to its insertion. The tendon of the psoas magnus is joined by the iliacus, and inserted into the poste- rior part of the trochanter minor, a bursa being interposed. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the ligamentum ar- cuatum internum of the diaphragm, kidney, psoas parvus, genito- crural nerve, sympathetic nerve, psoas fascia, peritoneum, colon, and along its pelvic border, the common and external iliac artery and vein. By its posterior surface with the lumbar vertebrae, lumbar arteries, quadratus lumborum (from which latter it is sepa- rated by the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis), and crural nerve, which, near Poupart's ligament, reaches its outer side. The lumbar plexus of nerves is situated in the substance of the posterior part of the muscle. In the thigh the muscle is in re- lation with the fascia lata in front; the border of the pelvis and hip-joint, from which it is separated by the synovial membrane,277 PECTINEUS.—ADDUCTOR MAGNUS. common to it and the preceding muscle, behind; the crural nerve and iliacus muscle to the outer side ; and the femoral artery, by which it is slightly overlaid, to the inner side. The Pectineus is a flat and quadrangular muscle ; it arises from the pectineal line (pecten, a crest) of the os pubis, and from the surface of bone in front of that line. It is inserted into the ridge leading from the anterior intertrochanteric line to the linea aspera of the femur. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which separates it from the femoral artery and vein and internal saphenous vein, and lower down with the profunda artery. By its posterior surface with the capsule of the hip-joint, obturator externus and adductor brevis, the obturator vessels being interposed. By its external border with the psoas, the femoral artery resting on the line of interval. By its internal border with the outer edge of the adductor longus. Obturator hernia is situated directly behind this muscle, which forms one of its coverings. The Adductor longus (adducere, to draw to ; caput longum tricipitis), the most superficial of the three adductors, arises by a round and thick tendon from the front surface of the os pubis, im- mediately below the angle of that bone ; and, assuming a flattened and expanded form as it descends, is inserted into the middle third of the linea aspera. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and near its insertion, with the femoral artery and vein. By its posterior surface with the adductor brevis and magnus, anterior branches of the obturator vessels and nerve, and, near its insertion, profunda artery and vein. By its outer border with the pectineus, by the inner border with the gracilis. The pectineus must be divided near its origin and turned outwards, and the ad- ductor longus through its middle, turning its ends to either side, to bring into view the adductor brevis. The Adductor brevis (caput breve tricipitis), placed behind the pectineus and adductor longus, is fleshy, and thicker than the ad- ductor longus ; it arises from the body of the os pubis, and is in- serted into the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pectineus, adductor longus, and anterior branch of the obturator nerve and artery. By its posterior surface with the adductor magnus. By its outer border with the obturator externus, and tendon of the psoas and iliacus. By its inner border with the gracilis and adductor magnus. The adductor brevis is pierced near its insertion by the middle perforat- ing artery. The adductor brevis may now be divided from its origin and turned outwards, or its inner two-thirds may be cut away entirely, when the adductor magnus muscle will be exposed in its entire extent. The Adductor magnus (caput magnum tricipitis) is a broad tri-POSTERIOR FEMORAL REGION. 278 angular muscle, forming a septum of division between the muscles situated on the anterior and those on the posterior aspect of the thigh. It arises by fleshy fibres from the ramus of the pubes and ischium and from the side of the tuber ischii; and radiating in its passage outwards, is inserted into the whole length of the linea aspera, and inner condyle of the femur. The adductor magnus is pierced by five openings; the three superior, for the three per- forating arteries ; the fourth, for the termination of the profunda. The fifth is the large oval opening, in the tendinous portion of the muscle, that gives passage to the femoral vessels. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pectineus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, femoral artery and vein and profunda artery and vein, with their branches. By its posterior surface with the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, biceps, and gluteus maxi- mus. By its inner border with the gracilis and sartorius. By its upper border with the obturator externus, and quadratus femoris. The Gracilis (slender; rectus internus) is situated along the inner border of the thigh. It arises by a broad but very thin tendon, from the body of the os pubis along the edge of the sym- physis, and from the margin of the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; it is inserted by a rounded tendon into the inner tuberosity of the tibia, beneath the expansion of the sartorius. Relations.—By its inner or superficial surface with the fascia lata, and below with the sartorius and internal saphenous nerve ; the internal saphenous vein crosses it lying superficially to the fascia lata. By its outer or deep surface with the adductor longus, brevis, and magnus, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee- joint, from which latter it is separated by a synovial bursa common to it and the tendons of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus. . Actions.—The iliacus, psoas, pectineus, and adductor longus muscles bend the thigh upon the pelvis, and at the same time, from the obliquity of their insertion into the lesser trochanter and linea aspera, rotate the limb outwards ; the pectineus and adductors adduct the thigh powerfully, and from the manner of their inser- tion into the linea aspera, assist in rotating the limb outwards. The gracilis is an adductor of the thigh; but contributes to the flexion of the leg, by its attachment to the inner tuberosity of the tibia. Posterior Femoral Region. Biceps femoris, Semi-tendinosus, Semi-membranosus. ♦ Dissection. —Eemove the integument and fascia from the posterior part of the thigh by two flaps, as on the anterior region, and turn aside the gluteus maximus from the upper part; the muscles may then be examined. The Biceps femoris (bis, double, K€<pa\r), head; flexor cruris externus vel fibularis) arises by two heads, one (caput longum) bySEMI-TENDINOSUS. 279 Fig. 134. a common tendon with the semi-tendinosus from the upper and back part of the tuber ischii; the other (caput breve) muscular and much shorter, from the lower two- thirds of the external border of the linea aspera. The biceps forms the outer hamstring, and is inserted by a strong tendon into the head of the fibula; one portion of the tendon being continued downwards into the fascia of the leg, and another being attached to the outer tuberosity of the tibia. Relations.—By its superficial or posterior surface with the gluteus maximus and fascia lata. By its deep or anterior surface with the semi-membranosus, adductor mag- nus, vastus externus, from which it is separated by the external inter- muscular fascia, great ischiatic nerve, popliteal artery and vein, and near its insertion the external head of the gastrocnemius, and plantaris. By its inner border with the semi- tendinosus, and in the popliteal space with the popliteal artery and vein. The Semi-tendinosus, remarkable for its long tendon, arises in common with the long head of the biceps, from the upper and back part of the tuberosity of the ischium : the two muscles being closely united for se- veral inches below their origin. It is inserted into the inner tuberosity of the tibia, immediately below the insertion of the tendon of the graci- lis, and sends an expansion to the fascia of the leg.

By its deep surface with the semi-mem- branosus, adductor magnus, internal head of the gastrocnemius, and internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, the synovial bursa common to it and the tendon of the gracilis being interposed. By its inner border with the gracilis; by its outer border with the biceps. These two muscles must be dissected from the tuberosity of the ischium, to bring into view the origin of the next. The Semi-membranosus, remarkable for the tendinous expansion upon its anterior and posterior surface, arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the common origin of the two preceding muscles. It is inserted into the posterior part of the inner tube- rosity of the tibia; at its insertion the tendon splits into three portions, one of which is inserted in a groove on the inner side of the head of the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The second is continuous with an aponeurotic expansion that binds down the popliteus muscle, the popliteal fascia; and the third turns upwards and outwards' to the external condyle of the femur, forming the middle portion of the posterior ligament of the knee- joint (ligamentum posticum Winslowii). The tendons of the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, gracilis and sartorius, form the inner hamstring. Relations.—By its superficial surface with, the gluteus maximus, biceps, semi-tendinosus, fascia lata, and, at its insertion, the ten- dinous expansion of the sartorius. By its deep surface with, the quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, internal head of gastrocne- mius, knee-joint from which it is separated by a synovial mem- brane, and popliteal artery and vein. By its inner border with the gracilis. By its outer border with, the great ischiatic nerve, and in the popliteal space, the popliteal artery and vein. If the semi-membranosus muscle be turned down from its origin, the student will bring into view the broad and radiated expanse of the adductor magnus, against which the three flexor muscles above described rest. Actions.—The three hamstring muscles are flexors of the leg upon the thigh; and taking their fixed point from below, they balance the pelvis on,the lower extremities. The biceps, from the obliquity of its direction, everts the leg when partly flexed, and the semi-tendinosus turns the leg inwards when in the same state of flexion. Anterior Tibial Region. Tibialis anticus, Peroneus tertius, Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor proprius pollicis. Dissection.—The dissection of the anterior tibial region is to be commenced by carrying an incision along the middle of the leg,TIBIALIS ANTICUS. EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM. 281 midway between the tibia and fibula, from tbe knee to the ankle, and bounding ibinferiorly by a trans- verse incision extending from one malleolus to the other. And to expose the tendons' on the dorsum of the foot, the longitudinal incision may be carried onwards to the outer side of the base of the great toe, and terminated by another incision di- rected across the heads of the meta- tarsal bones. The Tibialis anticus (flexor tarsi tibialis) arises from the outer tube- rosity and upper two-thirds of the tibia, the interosseous membrane, intermuscular fascia, and deep fascia; its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular liga- ment, and is inserted into the inner and under side of the internal cunei- form bone, and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the deep fascia, from which many of its superior fibres arise, and the anterior annular liga- ment. By its posterior surface with the interosseous membrane, tibia, ankle-joint, and bones of the tarsus. By its internal surface with the tibia; by its external surface with the extensor longus digitorum, ex- tensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. The Extensor longus digitorum (extensor communis longus) arises from the outer tuberosity of the tibia, the head and upper three- fourths of the fibula, the interos- seous membrane, intermuscular fascia and deep fascia.

The mode of insertion of the extensor tendons, both in the hand and in the foot, is remarkable; each tendon spreads into a broad aponeurosis over the first phalanx ; this aponeurosis is strengthened on its borders by the tendons of the lumbricales and interossei, and divides into three slips ; the middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, the two lateral slips are con- tinued onwards, to be inserted into the base of the third. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and anterior annular ligament. By its posterior sur- face with the interosseous membrane, fibula, ankle-joint, extensor brevis digitorum (which separates its tendons from the tarsus), meta- tarsus and phalanges. By its inner surface, with the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels. By its outer border with the peroneus longus and brevis. The Peroneus tertius (flexor tarsi fibularis) arises from the lower fourth of the fibula and intermuscular fascia, and is inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Although apparently but a mere division or continuation of the extensor longus digitorum, this muscle may be looked upon as analogous to the flexor carpi ulnaris of the forearm. Sometimes it is wanting. The Extensor proprius pollicis (extensor hallucis longus) lies between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula and interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and anterior annular ligament. By its posterior sur- face with the interosseous membrane, fibula, tibia, ankle-joint, extensor brevis digitorum, and bones and articulations of the great toe. It is crossed on this aspect by the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its outer side with the extensor longus digitorum, and in the foot with the dorsalis pedis artery and veins ; the outer side of its tendon on the dorsum of the foot being the guide to these vessels. By its inner side with the tibialis anticus, and anterior tibial vessels. A ctions.— The tibialis antiGus and peroneus tertius are direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg ; acting in conjunction with the tibialis posticus they direct the foot inwards, and with the peroneus longus and brevis outwards. They assist also in preserving the flatness of the foot during progression. The extensor longus digi- torum and extensor proprius pollicis are extensors of the phalanges ; and continuing their action, they assist the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, in flexing the foot upon the leg. Taking their origin from below, they increase the stability of the ankle-joint.283 POSTERIOR TIBIAL REGION. Posterior Tibial Region. Superficial Group. Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, Soleus. Dissection.—Make an incision from the middle of the popliteal space down the 136.* middle of the posterior part of the leg to the heel, bounding it inferiorly by a trans- verse incision passing between the two malleoli. Turn aside the flaps of integu- ment and remove the fasciae from the whole of this region : the gastrocnemius muscle will then be exposed. The Gastrocnemius (yavTpoKvriiAiov, the bellied part of the leg ; gemellus surse) arises by two heads (gemellus externus et internus) from the upper part of the two condyles of the femur, the inner head being the longest. They unite to form the beau- tiful muscle so characteristic of this region of the :limb. It is inserted, by means of the tehdo-Achillis, into the lower part of the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis, a synovial bursa being placed between the tendon and the upper part of the tuberosity. The gastrocnemius must be removed from its origin, and turned down in order to expose the next muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the leg, which separates it from the external saphenous vein, and with the external saphenous nerve. By its deep surface with the lateral portions of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, the popliteus, plantaris, and soleus. The internal head of the muscle rests against the posterior surface of the internal condyle of the femur ; the external head against the outer side of the exter- nal condyle. In the latter a sesamoid bone is sometimes found. The Plantaris (planta, the sole of the * Superficial muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg. 1. Biceps, forming the outer hamstring. 2.

The Soleus (solea,^ sole,) is the broad muscle upon which the plantaris rests. It arises from the head and upper half of the fibula, from the oblique line and middle third of the tibia and from a tendinous arch thrown across between these two portions. Its fibres converge to the tendo-Achillis, by which it is inserted into the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. The tendinous arch gives passage to the popliteal vessels and nerve in their course to the leg. Relations.—Bj its superficial surface with the gastrocnemius and plantaris. By its deep surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and peroneal vessels. Actions.—The three muscles (triceps surse, extensor pedis) of the calf draw powerfully on the os calcis, and lift the heel; continuing their action they raise the entire body. This movement is attained by means of a lever of the second power, the fulcrum (the toes) being at one end, the weight (the body supported on the tibia) in the middle, and the power (these muscles) at the other extremity. They are, therefore, the walking muscles, and perform all move- ments that require the support of the whole body from the ground, as dancing, leaping, &c. Taking their fixed point from below, they steady the leg upon the foot. Dissection.—After the removal of the soleus, the deep layer will be found bound down by an intermuscular fascia which is to be dissected away; the muscles may then be examined. The Popliteus muscle (poples, the ham of the leg) forms the floor of the popliteal region at its lower part, and is bound tightly down by a strong fascia derived from the middle slip of the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle. It arises by a rounded tendon from a deep groove at the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, beneath the external lateral ligament and within the cap- sular ligament of the joint; and spreading obliquely over the head of the tibia, is inserted into the surface of bone above its oblique line. This line is called, from being the limit of insertion of the popliteus muscle, the popliteal line. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a thick fascia which separates it from the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteal vessels Deep Layer.

By its deep surface with the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, and upper part of the tibia. The Flexor longus pollicis (flexor hallucis longus) is the most superficial of the next three muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula, and passes through a groove in the astragalus * and os calcis, converted by tendinous fibres 1 into a distinct sheath lined by synovial membrane, into the sole of the foot, to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe.

By its inner border with the flexor longus digitorum. In the foot, tbie tendon of the flexor longus pollicis is connected with that of the flexor longus digitorum by a short tendinous slip. The Flexor longus digitorum (per- forans'; flexor communis longus) arises from the surface of the tibia, immediately below the popliteal line. Its tendon passes through a sheath, common to it and the tibialis posticus, behind the inner mal- leolus ; it then passes through a second sheath which is connected with a groove in the astragalus and os calcis into the sole of the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes, perforating the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum.

By its deep surface with the tibia and tibialis posticus. In the sole of the foot its tendon is in relation with the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum, which lie superficially to it, and it crosses the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. At the point of crossing it receives a tendinous slip of communication. The flexor longus pollicis must now be removed from its origin, and the flexor longus digitorum drawn aside, to bring into view the entire extent of the tibialis posticus. The Tibialis posticus (nauticus; extensor tarsi tibialis) lies upon the interosseous membrane, between the two bones of the leg. It arises by two heads from the adjacent sides of the tibia and fibula their whole length, from the interosseous membrane, and from an aponeurosis which binds it in its place. Its tendon passes inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and runs in the same sheath ; it then passes through a proper sheath over the deltoid ligament, and beneath the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid and internal cuneiform bone, a process of its tendon being prolonged outwards to the external cuneiform. While in the common sheath behind the internal malleolus, the tendon of the tibialis posticus lies internally to that of the flexor longus digitorum, from which it is separated by a thin fibrous partition. A sesamoid bone is usually met with in the tendon close to its insertion. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the intermuscular aponeurosis, flexor longus pollicis, flexor longus digitorum, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, peroneal vessels, and, in the sole of the foot, the abductor pollicis. By its deep surface with the in- terosseous membrane, fibula and tibia, ankle-joint and astragalus. The anterior tibial artery passes between the two heads of the muscle. The student will observe that the two latter muscles change their relative position to each other in their course. Thus, in the leg, the position of the three muscles from within outwards, is, flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis. At the inner malleolus, the relation of the tendons is, tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, both in the same sheath; then a broad groove, which lodges the posterior tibial artery, vense comites, and nerve ; and lastly, the flexor longus pollicis. Actions.—The popliteus is a flexor of the tibia upon the thigh, carrying it at the same time inwards so as to invert the leg. The flexor longus pollicis, and flexor longus digitorum, are the long flexors of the toes ; their tendons are connected in the foot by a short tendinous band, hence they necessarily act together. The tibialis posticus is an extensor of the tarsus upon the leg, and an antagonist to the tibialis anticus'. It combines with the tibialis anticus in adduction of the foot.287 FIBULAR REGION. Fibular Region. Peroneus longus, Peroneus brevis. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by continuing the dissec- tion of the anterior tibial region outwards beyond the fibula, to the border of the posterior tibial region. The Peroneus longus (irepovrj, fibula ; extensor tarsi fibularis longior) arises from the head and upper half of the outer side of the fibula, from the deep fascia, and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a long tendon which passes behind the external malleolus, and obliquely across the sole of the foot, through the groove in the cuboid bone, to be inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Its tendon is thickened where it glides behind the external malleolus, and a sesamoid bone is developed in that part which plays against the cuboid bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with, the fibula, peroneus brevis, os calcis, cuboid bone, and, near the head of the fibula, the external popliteal nerve. By its anterior border it is separated from the extensor longus digitorum by the attachment of the fascia of the leg to the fibula ; and, by the posterior border, by the same medium from the soleus and flexor longus pollicis. The tendon of the peroneus longus is furnished with three fibrous sheaths and as many synovial mem- branes ; the first is situated behind the external malleolus, and is common to this muscle and the peroneus brevis, the second at the outer side of the os calcis, the third on the cuboid bone. The Peroneus brevis (extensor tarsi fibularis brevior) lies beneath the peroneus longus ; it arises from the lower half of the fibula and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a tendon which passes behind the external malleolus and through a groove in the os calcis, to be inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the peroneus longus and fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, os calcis, and cuboid bone. The lateral relations of the muscle are the same as those of the peroneus longus. The tendon of the peroneus brevis has but two tendinous sheaths and two synovial membranes, one being behind the external malleolus and common to both peronei, the other at the side of the os calcis. Actions.—The peronei muscles are extensors of the foot, conjointly with the tibialis posticus. They antagonise the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, which are flexors of the foot. The whole of these muscles acting together, tend to maintain the flatness of the foot, so necessary to security in walking. Foot. Dorsal Region. Extensor brevis digitorum, Interossei dorsales. The Extensor brevis digitorum muscle arises from the outerMUSCLES OF THE FOOT. 288 side of the os calcis, crosses the foot obliquely, and terminates in four tendons, the innermost of which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three into the side of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toe. Relations.—By its upper surface with, the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, peroneus brevis, and the deep fascia of the dorsum of the foot. By its under surface with the tarsal and metatarsal bones. Its inner border is in relation with the dorsalis pedis artery, the innermost tendon crossing that artery just before its division, The Interossei dorsales (bicipites) are placed between the meta- tarsal bones ; they resemble the analogous muscles in the hand in arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones ; their tendons are inserted into the base of the first phalanx, and the digital expansion of the tendons of the long extensor. The first dorsal interosseous is inserted into the inner side of the second toe, and is therefore an adductor: the other three are inserted into the outer side of the second, third, and fourth toe, and are consequently abductors. Relations.—By their upper surface with a strong fascia which separates them from the extensor tendons. By their under surface with the plantar interossei. Each of the muscles gives passage to a small artery (posterior perforating) which communicates with the external plantar artery. And between the heads of the first inter- osseous muscle the dorsalis pedis artery takes its course. Plantar Region. First Layer. Abductor pollicis, Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis digitorum. Dissection.—The sole of the foot is best dissected by carrying an incision around the heel, and along the inner and outer border of the foot, to the great and little toe. This incision should divide the integument and superficial fascia, and both together should be dis- sected from the deep fascia, as far forward as the base of the phalanges, where they may be removed from the foot altogether. The deep fascia should then be raised, and the first layer of muscles will be brought into view. The Abductor pollicis (vel hallucis) lies along the inner border of the foot; it arises by two heads, between which the tendons of the long flexors, arteries, veins, and nerves, enter the sole of the foot. One head proceeds from the inner tuberosity of the os calcis, the other from the internal annular ligament and plantar fascia ; it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and into the internal sesamoid bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the internal portion of the plantar fascia.

By its inner side with the flexor brevis digitorum, from which it is separated by the vertical septum of the plantar fascia, j The Flexor brevis digitorum (perforatus) is placed between the two preceding muscles. It arises from the under surface of the os calcis, from, the plantar fascia, and inter- muscular septa ; and is inserted by four tendons into the base of the second phalanx of the four lesser toes. Each tendon divides, previously to its insertion, to give passage to the tendon of the long flexor ; hence its cognomen perforatus. Relations;—By its superficial surface with the plantar fascia. By its deep surface with a thin layer of fascia which separates it from the musculus accessorius, tendons of the flexor longus digi- torum and flexor longus pollicis, and plantar vessels and nerves.

U290 MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OP THE FOOT. Second Layer. Musculus accessorius, Lumbricales. Dissection.—The three preceding muscles must be divided from their origin, and anteriorly through their tendons, and removed, in order to bring into view the second layer. The Musculus accessorius arises Fig. 139.* by two slips from either side of the under surface of the os calcis; the inner slip being fleshy, the outer ten- dinous and blended with the liga- mentum longum plantse. It is inserted into the outer side and upper surface of the tendon of the flexor longus digi- torum; of which muscle it may be regarded as a second and short head. It has been named "jnassa carnea Jacobi Sylvii" and " caro quadrata Sylvii." Relations.—By its superficial sur~ face with the three muscles of the superficial layer, from which it is separated by their fascial sheaths, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the under part of the os calcis and long calcaneo-cuboid ligament. The Lumbricales (lumbricus, an earthworm) are four little muscles arising from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum at their point of bi- furcation, and inserted into the expan- sion of the extensor tendons, and the base of the first phalanx of the four lesser toes on their tibial side. They pass between the digital slips of the plantar fascia to their inser- tion. The innermost lumbricalis is connected with only one tendon. Third Layer.

The F lexor brevis pollicts arises by a pointed tendinous pro- cess from the side of the cuboid, external cuneiform bone, and expanded tendon of the tibialis posticus ; it is inserted by two heads into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Two sesamoid bones are developed in the tendons of insertion of these two heads, and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis lies in the groove between them. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the abductor pollicis, tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the tarsal bones, metatarsal bone of the great toe, and insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. By its inner border with the abductor pollicis ; and by its outer border with the adductor pollicis; with both of which muscles it is blended near its insertion. The Adductor pollicis arises from the cuboid bone, the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and the base of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, in conjunction with the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with, the tendons of the flexor longus ajnd flexor brevis digitorum, musculus accessorius, and lum- bricales. By its deep surface with the tarsal bones and ligaments, external plantar artery and veins, interossei muscles, tendon of the peroneus longus, and metatarsal bone of the great toe. By its inner border with the flexor brevis pollicis; with which its fibres are blended. The Transversus pedis arises by fleshy slips, from the heads of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes. It passes transversely inwards to be inserted, into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, its tendon being blended with that of the adductor pollicis. The transversus pedis is regarded by some anatomists as a short head of the adductor pollicis; in its action it is obviously an ad- ductor ; while the adductor pollicis is as much a flexor as an adductor. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the tendons of the flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, and lumbricales. By its deep surface with the interossei and ligaments of the metatarso- phalangeal articulations. The Flexor brevis minimi digiti arises from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little toe at its outer side. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the tendons of the flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, the fourth lumbricalis, abductor minimi digiti, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the plantar interosseous muscle of the fourth metatarsal space, and the fifth metatarsal bone. u 2MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OP THE FOOT. 292 Fourth Layer. Interossei plantares. The Interossei plantares muscles are three in number, and are placed upon rather than between the metatarsal bones. They arise from the base of the metatarsal bone of the three outer toes, and are inserted into the inner side of the extensor tendon and base of the first phalanx of the same toes. In their action they are adductors. Relations.—By their superficial surface with the dorsal inter- ossei and metatarsal bones. By their deep surface with the ex- ternal plantar artery and veins, adductor pollicis, transversus pedis, and flexor minimi digiti. Actions.—All the preceding muscles act upon the toes ; and the movements which they are capable of executing may be referred to four heads, viz., flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction. In these actions they are grouped in the following manner:— Flexion. Flexor longus digitorum, Flexor brevis digitorum, Flexor accessorius, Flexor minimi digiti. Extension. Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor brevis digitorunu Adduction. x , . ( one dorsal, Interossei, j three Adduction. Interossei, three dorsal, Abductor minimi digiti. The great toe, like the thumb in the hand, enjoys an independent action, and is provided with distinct muscles to perform its move- ments. These movements are precisely the same as those of the other toes, viz. :— Flexion. Flexor longus pollicis, Flexor brevis pollicis. Extension. Extensor proprius pollicis, Extensor brevis digitorum. Adduction. Adductor pollicis, Transversus pedis. A oduction. Abductor pollicis. The only muscles excluded from this table are the lumbricales, four small muscles, which, from their attachments to the tendons of the long flexor, appear to be assistants in its action.293 ACTIONS OF MUSCLES.

Fascia (fascia, a bandage) is the name assigned to laminae of various extent and thickness, which are distributed through the different regions of the body, for the purpose of investing or pro- tecting the softer and more delicate organs. From a consideration of their structure, these fasciae may be arranged into two groups : areolo-fibrous fasciae, and aponeurotic fasciae. The areolo-fibrous fascia is best illustrated by the common sub- cutaneous investment of the entire body, the superficial fascia. This structure is situated immediately beneath the integument over every part of the frame, and is the medium of connexion between that layer and the deeper parts. It is composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and contains in its areolae an abundance of adipose cells. The fat being a bad conductor of caloric serves to retain the warmth of the body ; while it forms at the same time a yielding tissue, through which minute vessels and nerves pass to the skin, without incurring the risk of obstruction from injury or pressure. By dissection, the superficial fascia may be separated into two layers, between which are found the superficial or cutaneous vessels and nerves ; as the superficial epigastric artery, saphenous veins, radial and ulnar veins, superficial lymphatic vessels, and the cutaneous muscles, as the platysma myoides, orbicularis palpebrarum, sphincter ani, &c. In other situations, the areolo-fibrous fascia is found con- densed into a firm and dense membrane, as is exemplified in the deep fascia of the neck, the thoracic, transversalis, perineal fascia, and the sheaths of vessels. The aponeurotic fascia is the strongest kind of investing mem- brane ; it is composed of tendinous fibres, running parallel with each other, and connected by other fibres of the same kind passing in different directions, together with areolar tissue and fine elastic fibres. When freshly exposed, it is white, glistening, and irides- cent, and is firm, unyielding, and but little elastic. In the limbs it constitutes the deep fascia, enclosing and forming distinct sheaths to all the muscles and tendons. It is thick on the outer and least protected side of the limb, and thinner at its inner side. It is firmly connected to the bones, and to the prominent points of each region, as to the pelvis, knee, and ankle, in the lower ; and to the clavicle, scapula, elbow, and wrist, in the upper extremity. ItFASCLZE OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 296 assists the muscles in their action, by keeping np a tonic pressure on their surface ; aids materially in the circulation of the fluids in opposition to the laws of gravity : and in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is a powerful protection to the structures which enter into the composition of those regions. In some situations its tension is regulated by muscular action, as by the tensor vaginse femoris and gluteus maximus in the thigh, by the biceps in the leg, and by the biceps and palmaris longus in the arm ; in other situa- tions it affords an extensive surface for the origin of the fibres of muscles. The fasciae may be arranged, like the other components of the body, into—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. FASCIA OF THE HEAD AN I) NECK. The Temporal fascia is a strong aponeurotic membrane, which covers in the temporal muscle at each side of the head, and gives origin by its internal surface to some of its fibres. It is attached to the whole extent of the temporal ridge above, and to the zygo- matic arch below ; in the latter situation it is thick and divided into two layers, the external being connected to the upper border of the arch ; the internal to its inner surface. Some fat is found between these two layers, and the orbital branch of the temporal artery. The temporal fascia is covered in by the aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) of the occipito-frontalis muscle, which descends to be attached to the zygomatic arch. Cervical fascia.—The fasciae of the neck are the superficial and deep. The superficial cervical fascia is a part of the common superficial fascia of the entire body, and is only interesting from containing between its layers the platysma myoides muscle. The deep cervical fascia is a strong areolo-fibrous membrane, which invests the muscles of the neck, and retains and supports the vessels and nerves. It commences posteriorly at the ligamentum nucha3, and passes forwards at each side beneath the trapezius muscle to the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid ; here it divides into two layers, which embrace that muscle and unite upon its an- terior border to be prolonged onwards to the middle line of the neck, where it is continuous with the fascia of the opposite side. Besides constituting a sheath for the sterno-mastoid, it also forms sheaths for the other muscles of the neck over which it passes. If the superficial layer (anterior layer) of the sheath of the sterno-mastoid be traced upwards, it will be found to pass over the parotid gland and masseter muscle (fascia parotideo-masseterica), to be inserted into the zygomatic arch; if it be traced downwards, it will be seen to pass in front of the clavicle, and become lost upon the pectoralis major muscle. If the deep layer (posterior layer) of the sheath be examined superiorly, it will be found attached to the styloid pro- cess, from which it is reflected to the angle of the lower jaw, form-297 DEEP CERVICAL FASCIA. ing the stylo-maxillary ligament; and if it be followed downwards, it will be found connected with the tendon of the omo-hyoid muscle, and may thence be traced behind the clavicle, where it encloses the subclavius muscle, and being extended from the cartilage of the first rib to the coracoid process, constitutes the costo-coracoid mem- brane or ligament (fascia costo-clavicularis). In front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the deep fascia is attached to the border of the lower jaw, os hyoides, and anterior bellies of the digastrici (fascia supra-hyoidea), and forms a sheath for the sub-maxillary gland. Inferiorly it divides into two layers, one of which is at- tached to the interclavicular ligament and upper border of the sternum ; the other to its inner border. * Transverse section of the neck, showing the deep cervical fascia and its numerous prolongations, forming sheaths for the different muscles.

The thoracic fascia* is a dense layer of areolo-fibrous membrane stretched horizontally across the superior opening of the thorax. It is firmly attached to the concave margin of the first rib, and to the inner surface of the sternum. In front it leaves an opening for the union of the cervical with the thoracic portion of the thymus gland, and behind, forms an arch across the vertebral column, to give passage to the oesophagus. At the point where the great vessels and trachea pass through the thoracic fascia, it divides into an ascending and descending layer. The ascending layer is attached to the trachea, and be- comes continuous with the sheath of the carotid vessels, and with the deep cervical fascia ; the descending layer descends upon the trachea to its bifurcation, surrounds the large vessels arising from the arch of the aorta, and the upper part of the arch itself, and is continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. It is con- nected also with the vense innominata? and superior cava, and is attached to the areolo-fibrous capsule of the thymus gland. " The thoracic fascia," according to Sir Astley Cooper, "per- forms three important offices :—1st. It forms the upper boundary of the chest, as the diaphragm does the lower. 2nd. It steadily preserves the relative situation of the parts which enter and quit the thoracic opening. 3rd. It attaches and supports the heart in its situation, through the medium of its connexion with the aorta and large vessels which are placed at its curvature." Abdominal fascia.—The lower part of the parietes of the abdo- men and the cavity of the pelvis, are strengthened by a layer of fascia which lines their internal surface, and at the bottom of the latter cavity is reflected inwards upon the sides of the bladder. This fascia is continuous throughout the whole of the above-men- tioned surface ; but for convenience of description is considered under the several names of transversalis fascia, iliac fascia, and pelvic fascia ; the two former meet at the crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament, the latter is confined to the cavity of the true pelvis. The fascia transversalis (Fascia Cooperi)f is a thin fibrous membrane, which lines the inner surface of the transversalis muscle, and is interposed between that muscle and the peritoneum. It is thick and dense below, near the lower part of the abdomen ; but * See Sir Astley Cooper's work on the "Anatomy of the Thymus Gland." t Sir Astley Cooper first described this fascia in its important relation to inguinal hernia.FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS.—OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. 299 becomes thinner as it ascends, and is gradually lost in the sub- serous areolar tissue. It is attached inferiorly to the reflected margin of Poupart's ligament and to the crest of the ilium ; inter- nally, to the pectineal line and border of the rectus muscle ; and, at the inner part of the femoral arch, is continued beneath Poupart's ligament, and forms the anterior segment of the crural canal, or sheath of the femoral vessels. The internal abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis internus, vel posterior) is situated in this fascia, at about midway between the symphysis pubis and anterior superior spine of the ilium, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament; it is oval in form, and bounded on its inDer side by a well-marked falciform border, but is ill- defined around its outer margin. From the circumference of this ring is given off an infundibuliform process which surrounds the testicle and spermatic cord, constituting the fascia propria of the spermatic cord, and forms the first investment to the sac of oblique inguinal hernia. It is the strength of the transversalis fascia, in the interval between the tendon of the rectus and the internal abdominal ring, that defends the parietes against the frequent occurrence of direct inguinal hernia. Inguinal hernia.—Inguinal hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. In oblique inguinal hernia the intestine escapes from the cavity of the abdomen into the spermatic canal (canalis inguinalis) through the internal abdominal ring, pressing before it a pouch of peritoneum which constitutes the hernial sac, and distending the infundibuliform process of the transversalis fascia. After emerging through the internal abdominal ring it passes firstly beneath the lower and arched border of the transversalis muscle ; then beneath the lower border of the internal oblique muscle ; and finally through the external abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis externus, vel anterior) in the aponeurosis of the external oblique. From the transversalis muscle it receives no investment; while passing be- neath the lower border of the internal oblique it obtains the cremas- ter muscle ; and on escaping at the external abdominal ring, receives the intercolumnar fascia. So that the coverings of an oblique in- guinal hernia, after it has emerged through the external abdominal ring, are, from the surface to the intestine, the Integument, Cremaster muscle, Superficial fascia, Transversalis, or infundibuliform Intercolumnar fascia, Peritoneal sac. fascia, The spermatic canal, which in the normal condition of the abdo- minal parietes serves for the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament with its vessels in the female, is300 DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA. about one inch and a half in length. It is bounded in front by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle ; behind by the trans- versalis fascia, and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis; above by the arched border of the internal oblique and transversalis ; below by the grooved border of Poupart's liga- ment : and at each extremity by one of the abdominal rings, the internal ring at the inner, the external ring at the outer extremity. These relations may be more distinctly illustrated by the following plan: Above. Lower border of internal oblique and transversalis. Behind. Transversalis fascia. Conjoined tendon' of internal oblique and transversalis. Below. Grooved border of Poupart's ligament. There are three * varieties of oblique inguinal hernia : common, congenital, and encysted. Common oblique hernia is that which has been described above. Congenital hernia results from the non-closure of the pouch of peritoneum carried downwards into the scrotum by the testicle, during its descent in the foetus. In consequence of this defect, the intestine at some period of life is forced into the peritoneal canal, and descends through it into the tunica vaginalis, where it lies in contact with the testicle ; so that congenital hernia has no proper sac, but is contained within the tunica vaginalis. The other cover- ings are the same as those of common inguinal hernia. Encysted hernia (hernia infantilis, of Hey) is that form of pro- trusion in which the pouch of peritoneum forming the tunica vagi- nalis, being only partially closed, and remaining open externally to the abdomen, admits of the hernia passing into the scrotum, behind the tunica vaginalis. So that the surgeon, in operating upon this variety, requires to divide three layers of serous membrane ; the first and second layer being those of the tunica vaginalis; the third the true sac of the hernia. Direct inguinal hernia has received its name from passing directly through the external abdominal ring, and forcing before it the opposing parietes. This portion of the wall of the abdomen is strengthened by the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and * Velpeau describes a fourth, in which the protrusion takes place between the edge of the rectus and the umbilical ligament, and then takes the course of the spermatic canal.

Its coverings therefore are, the Direct inguinal hernia differs from oblique, firstly, in never at- taining the same bulk, in consequence of the resisting nature of the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis and trans- versalis fascia ; secondly, in its direction, having a tendency to protrude from the middle line rather than towards it. Thirdly, in making for itself a new passage through the abdominal parietes, jnstead of following a natural channel; and fourthly, in the rela- tion of the neck of its sac to the epigastric artery ; that vessel lying to the outer side of the opening of the sac of direct hernia, and to the inner side of that of oblique hernia. All the forms of inguinal hernia are designated scrotal, when they have descended into the cavity of the scrotum. The fascia iliac a (lumbo-iliaca) is the aponeurotic investment of the psoas and iliacus muscle; and like the fascia transversalis, is thick below, and becomes gradually thinner as it ascends. It is attached superiorly, along the edge of the psoas, to the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, to the liga- ment am arcuatum internum, and to the bodies of the lumbar ver- tebrae, leaving arches corresponding with the constricted part of the vertebrae for the transit of the lumbar vessels. Lower down it passes beneath the external iliac vessels, and is attached along the margin of the true pelvis ; externally it is connected to the crest of the ilium ; and, inferiorly, to the outer two-thirds of Poupart's ligament, where it is continuous with the fascia transversalis. Passing beneath Poupart's ligament, it surrounds the psoas and iliacus muscle to its termination, and beneath the inner part of the femoral arch forms the posterior segment of the crural canal or sheath of the femoral vessels. The fascia pblvica is an aponeurotic layer situated beneath the peritoneum, forming a covering to the walls of the pelvis, and re- flected from its walls upon the viscera. The pelvic fascia is attached to the internal surface of the ossa pubis near the symphysis, to the body of the pubes above the origin of the obturator internus muscle, to the ilio-pectineal line of the brim of the pelvis as far back as the sacro-iliac articulation, and to the margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen. Having descended upon the wall of the pelvis as low as the pubic arch in front, and the spine of the ischium behind, it divides in the direction of a line drawn between those points, into two layers, internal and external. The internal layer (recto-vesical) is continued downwards to the prostate gland, neck of the bladder, (vagina), and rectum, to which Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia, Conjoined tendon, Transversalis fascia, Peritoneal sac.302 OBTURATOR FASCIA. it is closely attached; and is reflected for a short distance upwards and downwards on those viscera. This layer is in contact, by its p Fig. 141.* external surface, with the levator ani muscle and coccygeus ; and is prolonged backwards over the sacral nerves to the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx, to which it is attached, meeting at the middle line the layer of the opposite side. The external layer is the obturator fascia, it covers in the ob- turator muscle, and is attached to the ramus of the pubes and ischium in front, and to the tuberosity of the ischium and falciform border of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament below. The levator ani arises from the line of division of the two layers of the pelvic fascia. The anterior border of the pelvic fascia is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a narrow interval, and the fascia passing from the side of the symphysis to the upper part of the prostate gland and front of the neck of the bladder, constitutes the anterior true ligament of the bladder (pubio-vesicale); a little * Transverse section of the pelvis, showing the distribution of the pelvic fascia. 1.

Upon the rectum and vagina it also forms a sheath. The posterior boundary of the pelvic fascia forms a free semilunar border in front of the pyriformis muscle. Perineal fascia.—The fasciae of the perineum are the superfi- cial and the deep. The superficial fascia consists as in other situations of two layers, one lying next the skin and containing an abundance of fat, the other more condensed lying in contact with the muscles.

The deep layer ox proper perineal fascia (fascia perinei superfi- cialis) is divisible into two portions, anterior and posterior, the former investing the muscles of the perineum, the other the ischio- rectal fossa. The anterior portion (fascia ischio-pubica, Velpeau) is a thin aponeurotic layer which covers in the muscles of the geni- tal region of the perineum and the root of the penis. It is firmly t attached at each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; pos- teriorly it is reflected upwards behind the transversi perinei muscles to become continuous with the deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament; while, in front it is continuous with the dartos in the male, and is lost in the labia majora and nymphse in the female.

The posterior portion of the perineal fascia (fascia analis ; ischio- rectal, Velpeau) lines the deep fossa (excavatio perinei) which surrounds the anus and levator ani muscles, and is bounded exter- nally by the ischia and internal obturator muscles, and behind by the glutei maximi, the ischio-rectal fossa. The ischio-rectal fascia is continuous with the anterior portion of the fascia perinei in front; invests the levatores ani as high as their origin, and the ob- turator fascia at each side, and is attached to the tuberosities of the ischia and great sacro-ischiatic ligaments. In the ischio-rectal fossa the two layers of the superficial fascia are separated by the masses of fat which fill that cavity. The deep perineal fascia (ligamentum triangulare ; perineale ; Camper's ligament) is a thin layer of aponeurosis stretched across the anterior portion of the outlet of the pelvis; it is attached at each side to the pelvic border of the ramus of the pubes and ischium as far back as the origin of the erector penis muscle. Anteriorly, it is convex and closely connected with the subpubic ligament; while, posteriorly, it is concave, and turns forward around the pos- terior border of the transversi perinei muscles, to become conti- nuous with the superficial perineal fascia. At its middle, it is about an inch and a half in depth ; at one inch below the pubic arch, it is pierced by the membranous portion of the urethra, and nearer the pubic arch, by the dorsal vein of the penis and internal pudic arteries. Directly behind the triangular ligament are situated the compres- sor urethrse muscle, the arteries of tbe bulb, and Cowper's glands, and more deeply the pelvic fascia, which has been described as a posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. FASCIJ3 OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia of the upper extremity contains between its layers the superficial veins and lymphatics, and superficial nerves. The deep fascia is thin over the deltoid and pectoralis major muscle, and in the axillary space, but thick on the dorsum of the scapula, where it binds down the infraspinatus muscle. It is at- tached to the clavicle, coracoid process, acromion process, and spine of the scapula, and forms separate sheaths for all the muscles of the scapula and shoulder. In the upper arm (fascia brachialis) it is somewhat stronger, receives fibres from the lower border of the tendon of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, as also from the costo-coracoid membrane and deltoid, and forms an anterior and posterior sheath for the muscles lying in front of and behind the humerus. It is attached to the condyloid ridges, by means of the internal and external intermuscular septum (ligamenta intermus- xFASCIA OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 306 cularia) and is inserted inferiorly into the two condyles, the ole- cranon, and posterior border of the nlna, being continuous between these points with the fascia of the forearm. Besides forming sepa- rate sheaths for the muscles, the anterior portion of the brachial fascia gives a sheath likewise to the brachial vessels and median nerve. The deep fascia of the forearm, fascia antibrachialis, is strong, and at the bend of the elbow is augmented in thickness by a broad band, which is given off from the inner side of the tendon of the biceps. It is firmly attached to the olecranon process, to the ulna, and to the prominent points about the wrist, forms sheaths for the muscles and vessels, gives origin to some of the fibres of the muscles, and is pierced a little above the wrist by the tendon of the palmaris longus. At the wrist the transverse fibres form the anterior and posterior annular ligament. The anterior annular ligament is a narrow band of fibres at- tached externally to the scaphoid, and internally to the pisiform bone and tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris; it is continuous above with the faseia antibrachialis, and below with the proper annular ligament of the wrist; being separated from the latter by the ulnar vessels and tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. The posterior annular ligament, thicker than the anterior, is an oblique band about half an inch in breadth, extending from the lower end and styloid process of the radius, to the cuneiform and pisiform bone at the border of the carpus. It is continuous above with the fascia of the forearm, below with the thin fascia of the dorsum of the hand, and sends processes inwards to be attached to the bones and form sheaths for the extensor tendons. There are six of these sheaths, the first on the radial side giving passage to the extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis ; the second, to the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior ; the third, to the extensor secundi internodii ; the fourth, to the extensor indicis and extensor communis digitorum; the fifth, which is placed between the two bones, to the extensor digiti minimi; and the sixth, situated on the ulna, to the extensor carpi ulnaris. The tendons in passing through these sheaths are each provided with a synovial bursa. On the back of the hand there are two fascia?, superficial and deep. The fascia dorsalis superficialis is thin and covers in the extensor tendons; it is attached laterally to the metacarpal bones of the index and little finger, and is continuous above with the posterior annular ligament. The fascia dorsalis profunda is stretched across the metacarpal spaces and covers in the interossei muscles. The palmar fascia is divided into three portions. A central portion, which occupies the middle of the palm, and two lateral portions, which are thin and enclose the muscles of the borders of the hand, being continuous with the dorsal fascia. The central portion is strong and tendinous : it is narrow at the wrist, where itFASCLffi OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 307 is attached to the annular ligament and receives the insertion of the tendon of the palmaris longus, and broad over the heads of the metacarpal bones, where it divides into four processes, each of which subdivides to embrace the root of the corresponding finger. These processes are attached at the middle line to the sheath of the tendons, and at the side of each finger to the lateral and transverse ligament. The fascia is strengthened at tbis point of division by- strong fasciculi of transverse fibres; the arched interval caused by the bifurcation of each slip gives passage to the tendons of the flexor muscles, while the greater arches between the fingers transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and lumbricales muscles. FASCTiE OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia contains between its two layers the super- ficial vessels and nerves of the lower extremity. At the groin these two layers are separated from each other by the superficial lymphatic glands, and the deep layer is attached to Poupart's ligament, while the superficial layer is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen^ The deep fascia of the thigh is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata; it is thick and strong upon the outer side of the limb, and thinner at its inner and posterior side. That portion of the deep fascia which invests the gluteus maximus is very thin, but that which covers in the gluteus medius is excessively thick, and gives origin, by its inner surface, to the superficial fibres of that muscle. The fascia lata is attached superiorly to Poupart's ligament, the crest of the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, tuberosity of the ischium, ramus of the ischium and pubes, body of the pubes, and pectineal line; it has also a deep attachment (ligamentum iliacum) to the anterior border of the ilium, tendon of origin of the rectus muscle and border of the acetabulum. It forms sheaths for the muscles of the thigh and femoral vessels, and is connected with the linea aspera by means of two intermuscular ligaments, external and internal; the former extending from the insertion of the gluteus maximus to the external condyle, and separating the vastus externus from the biceps muscle; the internal being attached to the inner branch of the linea aspera for a short distance above the internal condyle, and separating the vastus internus from the adductor magnus. The fascia lata receives the attachment of two muscles, tensor vaginse femoris and gluteus maximus, and glides over the trochanter major on a bursa. Inferiorly it is inserted into the head of the tibia, and forms a bridge across the popliteal space (fovea poplitea), being con- tinuous between its points of attachment with the fascia of the leg. In addition to the smaller openings in the fascia lata which trans- mit the small cutaneous vessels and nerves, there exists at the x 2FASCI2E OF THE LOWEK EXTREMITY. 308 upper and inner extremity of the thigh an oval opening (fovea ovalis), which gives passage to the superficial lymphatic vessels, and the large subcutaneous vein of the lower extremity, the in- ternal saphenous vein, aud is thence named the saphenous opening. The existence of this opening has given rise to the division of the upper part of the fascia lata into two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is situated upon the iliac side of the opening. It is attached to the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's liga- ment to the spine of the pubes, whence it is reflected downwards and outwards in an arched direction, and forms a falciform border, which constitutes the outer boundary of the saphenous opening. The edge of this border immediately overlies, and is adherent to, the sheath of the femoral vessels, and the lower extremity of the curve is continuous with the pubic portion. The pubic portion, occupying the pubic side of the saphenous opening is attached to the spine of the pubes and pectineal line ; and passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, divides into two layers ; the anterior layer is continuous with that portion of the iliac fascia which forms the sheath of the iliacus and psoas muscle, the posterior layer is lost upon the capsule of the hip-joint. The interval between the falciform border of the iliac portion and the opposite surface of the pubic portion is closed by an areolo- fibrous layer, derived from the superficial fascia, and pierced by numerous openings for the passage of lymphatic vessels, the cribri- form fascia (lamina cribrosa). The cribriform fascia is connected with the sheath of the femoral vessels, and forms one of the cover- ings of femoral hernia. When the iliac portion of the fascia lata is removed from its attachment to Poupart's ligament and turned aside, the sheath of the femoral vessels (the femoral or crural canal) is brought into view ; and if Poupart's ligament be carefully divided, the sheath may be isolated, and its continuation with the transversalis and iliac fascia demonstrated. In this view, the sheath of the femoral vessels is an infundibuliform continuation of the ab- dominal fascia, closely adherent to the vessels a little way down the thigh, but much larger than the vessels it contains at Poupart's liga- ment. If the sheath be opened, the artery and vein will be found lying side by side, and occupying the outer two-thirds of the sheath, leaving an infundibuliform interval between the vein and inner wall of the sheath. The superior opening of this space is named the femoral or crural ring ; it is bounded in front by Poupart's liga- ment, behind by the os pubis, internally by Gimbernat's ligament, and externally by the femoral vein. The interval itself serves for the passage of the superficial lymphatic vessels from the saphenous opening to a lymphatic gland, which generally occupies the femoral ring, and from thence they proceed into the current of the deep lymphatics. The femoral ring is closed merely by a thin layer of309 FEMORAL HERNIA. subserous cellular tissue,* which retains the lymphatic gland in its position, and is named septum crurale, and by the peritoneum. It follows from this description that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the parietes of the abdomen, particularly in the female, in whom the femoral arch, or space included between Poupart's liga- ment and the border of the pelvis, is larger than in the male, while the structures which pass through it are smaller. It happens, consequently, that if violent or continued pressure be made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced through the femoral ring into the infundibuliform space in the sheath of the femoral vessels, carrying before it the peritoneum and septum crurale,—this constitutes femoral hernia.

The direction which femoral hernia takes in its descent is at first downwards, then forwards, and then upwards ; and in endeavour- ing to reduce it, the application of the taxis must have reference to this course, and be directed in precisely the reverse order. The coverings of femoral hernia are, the The deep fascia of the leg {fascia cruralis) is attached to the inner and outer tuberosity of the tibia and head of the fibula, and receives an accession of fibres from the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis and biceps. Between its points of attachment, and espe- cially behind, it is continuous with the fascia of the thigh. In the front of the leg it encloses the tibialis anticus and extensor muscles, and affords origin to some of their fibres. On the outer side it forms a sheath for the peronei muscles ; and behind, two sheaths superficial and deep ; the former for the gastrocnemius and soleus with the tendo-Achillis ; the latter for the deep flexor muscles. At the ankle these four sheaths are differently arranged ; the posterior superficial sheath terminates on the os calcis with the tendo-Achillis ; the posterior deep sheath is attached at one side to the border of the internal malleolus, at the other to the os calcis and inner side of the foot, being blended with the origin of the abductor pollicis. This portion of the deep fascia is the internal annular ligament (laciniatum internum); it sends processes inwards to divide the tendons of the flexors and form sheaths for their passage into the foot. The sheath of the peronei muscles at the outer ankle is at- tached to the external malleolus on one side, and the border of the os calcis on the other, and forms the external annular ligament (laciniatum externum). The anterior portion of the fascia forms at the ankle the anterior annular and the cruciform ligament. The anterior annular ligament (transversum) is a band of transverse fibres about an inch and a half in breadth, situated immediately above the joint, and attached to the tibia and fibula at either side. The cruciform ligament (cruciatum) is composed of two bands about half an inch in width, blended with each other at their point of union on the front of the joint. The internal band is attached above to the internal malleolus and below to the os calcis at the outer side of the foot; the external band to the external malleolus Integument, Superficial fascia, Cribriform fascia, Fascia propria, Septum crurale, Peritoneal sac.311 PLANTAR FASCIA. above, and the scaphoid and internal cuneiform bone at the inner border of the foot. The internal band at its origin consists of two layers, between which passes the tendon of the tibialis anticus. The tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius have also a separate loop connected with the cruciform ligament, the sling ligament (fundiforme) of Retzius ; this is a narrow band which embraces the tendons in a sling-shaped loop, and passes outwards and backwards to be attached to the sulcus tali and neighbouring part of the calcaneum. The tendons passing through the loops and sheaths around the ankle are each furnished with a synovial bursa. That portion of the fascia cruralis which forms a septum between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg is sometimes called the intermuscular fascia; and in operations on the arteries of that region the deep layer of the deep fascia. There is besides another deep portion of fascia, above the preceding, the popliteal fascia, derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle and binding down the popliteus muscle. By its inferior border this fascia is inserted into the popliteal line of the tibia. The fascice dorsales pedis are three in number, superficial, middle, and deep. The fascia dorsalis pedis is thin and covers the dorsum of the foot, being continuous at the ankle with the cruciform ligament, and attached at either side to the borders of the foot, where it becomes united with the plantar fascia. A second or middle layer of fascia covers in the anterior part of the extensor brevis digitorum with its tendons ; and a third or deep layer is found beneath the latter, and covering in the interossei muscles. On the interossei muscles the three layers are united, and the extensor tendons are consequently separated from each other in their course to the toes. The Plantar fascia consists of three portions, middle and two lateral. The middle portion (fascia plantaris media) is thick and dense, and composed of strong aponeurotic fibres, closely interwoven with each other. It is attached posterioidy to the inferior surface of the tuberosities of the os calcis, and terminates under the heads of the metatarsal bones in five fasciculi. Each of these fasciculi bifurcates to embrace the base of the corresponding toe, and is attached in the middle to the sheath of the flexor tendons, and at either side to the head of the metatarsal bone. The point of division of the fascia into fasciculi is strengthened by transverse bands, which preserve the solidity of the fascia at its broadest part. The intervals be- tween the toes give passage to the digital arteries and nerves and lumbricales muscles. The lateral portions (fascia interna et externa) are thin, and cover the sides of the sole of the foot; they are continuous behind with the internal and external annular ligament; and on the mesial side with the central portion. The inner portion is con- tinuous along the border of the foot with the fascia of the dorsum ;FASCLZE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 312 the outer portion is attached to the os calcis and base of the meta- tarsal bone of the little toe, forming between these points a thick band, which gives origin to part of the abductor minimi digiti muscle. Besides constituting a strong layer of investment and defence to the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the dif- ferent muscles. A strong septum is given off from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fascia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groups, middle and two lateral; and transverse septa are stretched between these to sepa- rate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive part of their origin from the plantar fascia.CHAPTER V. OF THE ARTERIES. The arteries are the cylindrical tubes which convey the blood from the ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. They are dense in structure, and preserve for the most part the cylindrical form when emptied of their blood, which is their condition after death : hence they were considered by the ancients as the vessels for the transmission of the vital spirits,* and were therefore named arteries (drjp Twpeiv, to contain air). The artery proceeding from the left ventricle of the heart con- tains the pure or arterial blood, which is distributed throughout the entire system, and constitutes with its returning veins the greater or systemic circulation. That which emanates from the right ven- tricle conveys the impure blood to the lungs; and with its corre- sponding veins establishes the lesser or pulmonary circulation. The whole of the arteries of the systemic circulation proceed from a single trunk, named the aorta, from which they are given off as branches, and divide and subdivide to their ultimate ramifications, constituting the great arterial tree which pervades by its minute subdivisions every part of the animal frame. The mode in which the division into branches takes place is deserving of remark. From the aorta the branches, for the most part, pass off at right angles, as if for the purpose of checking the impetus with which the blood would otherwise rush along their cylinders from the main trunk ; but in the limbs a very diiferent arrangement exists ; the branches are given off from the principal artery at an acute angle, so that no impediment may be offered to the free circulation of the vital fluid. The division of arteries is usually dichotomous, as of the aorta into the two common iliacs, common carotid into the external and in- ternal, &c. ; but in some few instances a short trunk divides sud- denly into several branches which proceed in different directions: this mode of division is termed axis, as the thyroid and coeliac axis. Mr. Thomas William Nunn, in his "Observations and Notes on the Arteries of the Limbs," has very ably generalized the manner of distribution of these vessels. According to him, the main trunk of the artery of each segment of a limb divides into two branches, one which is intended for the supply of the component parts of the * To Galen is due the honour of the discovery that arteries contained blood, and not air.314 GENERAL ANATOMY OP ARTERIES. segment, the segmental branch ; and one which is the proper con- tinuation of the trunk of the vessel to the segment heyond, the trans-segmental branch. The segmental artery lies near the bone, diminishes rapidly in size, and gives off numerous branches which supply the bone and muscles and anastomose with other arteries. The trans-segmental artery retains its size throughout, and gives off no important branches, excepting at its commencement or near its termination, and is chiefly concerned in transmitting the current of blood to the segment beyond. Besides these, Mr. Nunn gives the name of anastomotic or communicating vessels to another group of arteries, whose office is to connect other vessels together. These anastomotic branches may run towards or from the centre of circu- lation, they may be single or double, or they may divide and re- unite, and so constitute an arterial plexus. They serve to connect together the branches of the segmental artery, the segmental with the trans-segmental, or they may unite distant portions of the same trunk. In the division of an artery into two branches, it is observed that the combined area of the two branches is somewhat greater than that of the single trunk ; and if the combined area of all the branches at the periphery of the body were compared with that of the aorta, it would be seen that the blood, in passing from the aorta into the numerous distributing branches, was flowing through a conical space, of which the apex might be represented by the aorta, and the base by the surface of the body. The advantage of this provision in facilitating the circulation is sufficiently obvious ; for the increased channel which is thus provided for the current of the blood, serves to compensate for the retarding influence of friction, resulting from the distance of the heart and the division of the vessels. Communications between arteries are free and numerous, and increase in frequency with the diminution in size of the branches ; so that, through the medium of the minute ramifications, the entire body may be considered as one uninterrupted circle of inosculations, or anastomoses (avh, between, arofxa, mouth). This increase in the frequency of anastomosis in the smaller branches is a provision for counteracting the greater liability to impediment existing in them than in the larger branches. Where freedom of circulation is of vital importance, this communication of the arteries is very re- markable, as in the circle of Willis in the cranium, or in the distribution of the arteries of the heart. It is also strikingly seen in situations where obstruction is most likely to occur, as in the distribution to the alimentary canal, around joints, or in the hand and foot. Upon this free communication existing everywhere between arterial branches is founded the principle of cure by the ligature of large arteries ; the ramifications of the branches given off from the artery above the ligature inosculate with those which proceed from the trunk of the vessel below the ligature ; these anastomosing branches enlarge and constitute a collateral circula- tion, in which, as is shown in the preparations made by Sir x\stley315 STRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. is thin in the large Fig. 145. % Cooper, several large branches perform the office of the single obliterated trunk. * The arteries do not terminate directly in veins ; but in an inter- mediate system of vessels, which, from their minute size (about -5-^5- of an inch in diameter), are termed capillaries (capillus, a hair). The capillaries constitute a microscopic network, which is distributed through every part of the body,+ so as to render it im- possible to introduce the smallest needle-point beneath the skin without wounding several of these fine vessels. It is through the medium of the capillaries, that all the phenomena of nutrition and secretion are performed. They are remarkable for their uniformity of diameter, and for the constant divisions and communications which take place between them, without any alteration of size. They inosculate on the one hand with the terminal ramusculi of the arteries ; and on the other with the minute radicles of the veins. Arteries are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external coat is firm and strong, and formed of tissues which take a longitudinal or oblique direction ; it arteries, but thicker than the middle coat in arteries; of small and medium size, and com- posed of areolar and elastic tissue. The areolar tissue consists of fine and coarse fasciculi and separate fibrils, among which are scattered numerous elongated nuclei; in arteries of the smallest size the areolar tissue is more nucleated and loses its fibrous charac- ter, and ultimately in the minutest vessel is changed into a delicate homogeneous mem- brane, in which the nuclei are gradually lost. The elastic tissue exists in small quan- tity in the large arteries, occupies the deep layer of the external coat, and is not dis- tinctly separable from the middle coat. In arteries of medium size it is more abundant, consists of larger fibres, and is laminated, the laminae approaching in character to elastic membrane. In small arteries the elastic tissue exists as a fine network in the deep layer of the external coat; in vessels still smaller it presents itself in a developmental form as fusiform cells, and in the smallest disappears altogether. * I have a preparation, showing the collateral circulation in a dog, in which I tied the abdominal aorta; the animal died from over-feeding nearly two years after the operation. f The only organs in which capillaries are wanting, are the corpora caver- nosa penis, and uterine placenta. % Smooth muscular fibre cells from the middle coat of the artery; 1. from the popliteal; 2. from a twig of the anterior tibial, half a line in diameter, a, a, elongated or rod-like nucleus.

In the small arteries it is wholly composed of smooth muscular fibres ; in arteries of medium size, as the external and internal carotid, brachial, crural, and popliteal, of a mixture of smooth muscular and elastic tissue ; and in the large arteries, as the aorta, common carotids and iliacs, chiefly of elastic tissue. The smooth muscular tissue is the only component structure of the middle coat of small arteries ; in which there are two or three laminae, the fibres about -g-tnnr °fan incn m diameter being arranged in rings ; in smaller arteries there is but one muscular lamina, the elements of the fibres being shorter and in proportion as the arteries are more and more minute, becoming reduced to the earliest developmental form, namely, short elliptic cells with oblong nuclei ; ultimately they are completely lost. In arteries of medium size, elastic fibres are super- added to the muscular fibres, the latter predominating for awhile, and in the large arteries the smooth muscular fibres are reduced to their cellular form and gradually diminished in number and im- portance, until they exist as mere rudimentary elements scattered among the layers of elastic tissue, of which the middle coat of large arteries is principally composed. The elastic tissue is absent altogether in the middle coat of small arteries, but makes its appearance in arteries of medium size as fine fibres disposed in a network of wide meshes. In the larger kind of medium-sized arteries, the elastic net- work is mingled with areolar tissue, and a tendency to the alternation of these tissues begins to be apparent; further- more, in some of the largest of the medium arteries the elastic tissue is found, in parts of the vessel, to occupy the whole thickness of the middle coat, thus leading upwards to the large ves- sels in which the elastic tissue is the chief constituent. While thus encroaching as it were on the structure of the middle coat of arteries, the elastic tissue presents a corresponding series of transitional forms; at first it exists as fine fibres disposed singly or in a fine net- work with open meshes ; then the fibres become larger and the meshes closer; and interlaced so as to form a fibrous mem- brane with narrow meshes; next by the increase of breadth * Network of coarse elastic tissue from the middle coat of the pulmonary artery of the horse; the fibres are pierced with circular openings.

In medium-sized ar- teries the elastic tissue forms a single layer lying exteriorly to the muscular fibres in the largest arteries of this class ; it is mingled with areolar tissue, and exhibits a tendency to become laminated, the lamina? alternating with similar layers of areolar tissue. In the large arte- ries this is the common character of the middle coat ; the elastic tissue is laminated, and between the laminae are strata of areolar and muscular tissue. The presence of elastic tissue as a chief con- stituent of the middle coat of arteries, gives them a yellow colour, while those arteries in which the muscular tissue is abundant have a reddish tint. In the aorta, the lamina? of the middle coat are forty or fifty in number. The internal coat is the thinnest of the three, and easily broken in the transverse direction ; it is composed of two layers, an internal layer or epithelium and an external elastic membrane, which is either homo- geneous or made up of elastic elements, dis- posed in a longitudinal direction. In the middle-sized and large arteries there is a third and intermediate layer, consisting of an imperfect areolar tissue provided with a network of elastic tissue, and presenting in certain situations a peculiar structure which has received the name of striped lamellce. The epithelium is composed of slender fusiform cells with elon- gated nuclei, lying parallel with the axis of the vessel; they are more lengthened in the small than in the large arteries, and in those of the smallest calibre are only distinguishable by their nuclei. The elastic layer is a thin, homogeneous membrane of the fenestrated kind, perforated with minute oblong openings having a direction parallel with the axis of the vessel. It is folded into longitudinal ruga? when the vessel is empty, and becomes extremely delicate and is finally lost in the minute vessels. Exteriorly this layer assumes a reticulated character, and is made up of a longitudinal network of elastic fibres.

The striped lamellce are situated in this layer, and consist of clear lamellae, sometimes striped, sometimes nucleated, and sometimes homogeneous.. They lie immediately beneath the epithelium, and when nucleated bear so close a resemblance to that layer, as to have been regarded as a metamorphosed epithelium ; when homogeneous their nearest analogue is elastic membrane, to which tissue they appear to belong. In the internal coat of certain arteries, as of the axillary and popliteal, Kolliker has found smooth muscular fibres. In taking a summary survey of the constituent tissues of the three coats of arteries in their order of succession from without in- wards, it will be seen that the external coat consists of areolar and elastic tissue ; the middle coat of smooth muscular fibre, areolar and elastic tissue ; and the internal coat of elastic tissue and epithelium. Capillaries or capillary vessels have only one coat, which is thin, transparent, and structureless; resembling, in this respect, cell-membrane and the sarcolenmia of muscular fibre ; in approach- ing the arteries and veins this coat becomes somewhat thicker, and is finally lost in the elastic membrane of the in- ternal coat of the arteries, and in that of the middle coat of the veins. The increasing thickness of the coat of capil- laries causes a distinction of these vessels intone and coarse, and the latter gradu- ally augmenting in size and complexity of structure, become the transitional vessels. On the inner surface of ca- pillaries, and dispersed at short dis- tances, are oblong nuclei, the nuclei become placed nearer together in the coarse capillaries and transitional ves- sels, and in the arteries and veins consti- tute the epithelial layer of the internal coat. In distribution, capillary vessels form plexuses by their frequent com- munication with each other; and these plexuses present considerable variety in the closeness of their meshes and the number and size of the vessels. They are most abundant and largest in the * Transition of a minute artery into capillary vessels; from the brain; after Kolliker. 1. Minute artery. 2. Transitional capillary. 3.

In the bones the capillaries are large, but the plexuses scanty. The arteries in their distribution through the body are in- cluded in a loose areolo-fibrous investment, which separates them from surrounding tissues, and is called a sheath. Around the principal vessels the sheath is an important structure; it is composed of areolar tissue, intermingled' with aponeurotic fibres, and is continuous with the fascise of the region in which the arteries are situated, as with the thoracic and cervical fascia in the neck, transversalis and iliac fascia, fascia lata in the thigh, &c. The sheath of the arteries contains also their accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. The coats of arteries are. supplied with blood like other organs of the body, their vessels proceed from the neighbouring small branches, and are named vasa vasorum. The vasa vasorum or vasa nutritia are distributed in the external coat, some few making their way among the external layers of the middle coat. They are met with even on the smallest arteries, and form a rich capillary network with rounded meshes. The small veins which return the blood from the capillaries, open into the companion veins of the artery. The nerves, like the vasa vasorum, are found only in the external coat, and are wanting altogether in many arteries, as in those of the cerebral and spinal substance, the choroid membrane of the ovum, the placenta, and also in the arteries of some muscles, glands, and membranes. In the consideration of the arteries, we shall first describe the aorta, and the branches of that trunk with their subdivisions, which together constitute the efferent portion of the systemic circulation ; and then the pulmonary artery as the efferent trunk of the pul- monary circulation. AORTA. The Aorta arises from the base of the left ventricle, at the middle of the root of the heart, and presents at its commencement an enlargement (bulbus aortse) caused by three dilatations of the walls of the vessel, the sinus aortici (sinus Valsalvae) and corre- sponding with the three semilunar valves. It ascends at first forwards and to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into, the arch, and descend- ing aorta. The Arch op the aorta (arcus aortse), commencing at a point corresponding with the articulation of the cartilage of the fourth rib with the sternum on the left side, crosses behind and near the320 AOKTA. sternum to a point corresponding with the tipper border of the arti- culation of the second rib with the sternum on the right side. It then curves backwards and to the left, and descends to the left side Fig. 150.* * The large vessels of the root of the heart and lungs. 1.

The first or ascending portion of the arch (aorta ascendens), a little more than two inches in length, is almost wholly contained within the pericardium. It is crossed in front by the pulmonary artery ; on its left side it has the left auricle and pulmonary artery; on its right the right auricle and superior vena cava ; and behind the right pulmonary artery and veins. The second or transverse portion of the arch is crossed in front by the left phrenic nerve, left nervus superficialis cordis, left in- ferior cardiac of the pneumogastric, and left pneumogastric nerve. Behind it is in relation with the trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, nerves to the deep cardiac plexus, and left recurrent nerve. Above it gives off the arteria innomihata, left carotid and left subclavian artery, and supports the left vena innominata ; and below is in re- lation with the superficial cardiac plexus, bifurcation of the pulmo- nary artery, cord of the ductus arteriosus, left bronchus, and left recurrent nerve. The third or descending portion of the arch lies against the third dorsal vertebra, and is partially covered by the left pleura. Aorta descendens.—The descending aorta is subdivided in cor- respondence with the two great cavities of the trunk, into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Aorta thoracica.—The thoracic aorta commencing at the lower border and left side of the third dorsal vertebra curves gently towards the right as it descends, and as it passes through the aortic opening of the diaphragm lies on the middle line of the vertebral column. It is in relation behind, with the vertebral column and lesser vena azygos ; in front, with the oesophagus and right pneumogastric nerve ; to the left side, with the pleura; and to the right, with the thoracic duct. Aorta abdominalis.—The abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and between the two pillars of that muscle. In its course downwards, it lies on the vertebral column to the left of the middle line, and terminates on the fourth lumbar vertebra, by dividing into the two common iliac arteries. It is crossed in front by the left renal vein, pancreas, transverse duodenum, and mesentery, and is in relation behind with the thoracic duct, receptaculum chyli, and left lumbar veins. On its left side is situated the left semilunar ganglion, supra-renal cap- of the ductus arteriosus. 14. Left pulmonary artery. 15. Eight pulmonary arta-y. 16. Trachea. 17. Eight bronchus. 18.

The coronary arteries (cardiacse) arise from the aortic sinuses at the commencement of the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately above the free margin of the semilunar valves. The left coronary (coronaria cordis sinistra) passes forwards, between the pulmonary artery and left appendix auriculae, and divides into two branches ; one of which (posterior) winds around the base of the left ventricle in the auriculo-ventricular groove, andARTERIA INNOMINATA. 323 inosculates with the right coronary, forming an arterial circle around the base of the heart; the other (anterior) passes along the groove of union of the two ventricles, on the anterior aspect of the heart, to its apex, where it anastomoses with the right coronary. The left coronary artery supplies the left auricle and anterior surface of both ventricles. The right coronary (coronaria cordis dextra) passes forwards, between the root of the pulmonary artery and the right auricle, and winds along the auriculo-ventricular groove, to the posterior longi- tudinal furrow ; it then descends along the posterior aspect of the heart to its apex, and inosculates with the left coronary. It is dis- tributed to the right auricle and ventricle, and posterior surface of both ventricles, and sends a large branch along the sharp margin of the right ventricle to the apex of the heart. The Arteria innominata (Fig. 150, 4) is the first and largest artery given off by the arch of the aorta. It is an inch and a half in iength, and ascends obliquely towards the right sterno-clavicular articulation, where it divides into the right carotid and right sub- clavian artery. Relations.—It is in relation, in front, with the left vena inno- minata, sternum, and origin of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscle ; behind, with the trachea and right pneumogastric nerve ; to the right, with the right vena innominata and pleura ; to the left, with the left common carotid artery and remains of the thymus gland.

The arteria innominata occasionally gives off a small branch y 2324 COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. which ascends along the middle of the trachea to the thyroid gland. This branch was described by Neubauer, as the thyroidea ima (lowest thyroid artery), and Dr. Harrison names it the middle thyroid artery. A knowledge of its existence is important in per- forming the operation of tracheotomy. COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. The common carotid arteries (carotis communis vel primitiva ; Kapa, the head) arise, the right from the bifurcation of the arteria innominata opposite the right sterno-clavicular articulation, the left from the arch of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that the right carotid is shorter than the left ; it is also more anterior; and, in consequence of proceeding from a branch instead of from the main trunk, is larger than its fellow. The Eight common carotid artery (Fig. 150, 5) ascends the neck perpendicularly by the side of the trachea and larynx, from behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the external carotid and internal carotid. TheLeft common carotid (Fig. 150,11)passes somewhat obliquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the side of the neck, and thence upwards by the side of the trachea and oesophagus to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides like the right common carotid into the external carotid and internal carotid. Relations.—The common carotid artery, in the neck, is enclosed in a fibrous sheath, which also contains the internal jugular vein, lying to the outer side of the artery, and the pneumogastric nerve, which lies between and behind both. The sheath rests on the vertebral column, having interposed the sympathetic nerve and anterior muscles of the vertebral column, namely, longus colli and rectus anticus major ; and being crossed behind by the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve. To the inner side of the carotid is the trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and larynx ; to its outer side, and enclosed in its sheath, the jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve ; and in front, the sterno-thyroid, sterno- hyoid, sterno-mastoid, omo-hyoid, and platysma muscles, and the descendens noni nerve. The left common carotid, in addition to the relations just enumerated, which are common to both, is crossed near its commencement by the left vena innominata, and supports the remains of the thymus gland : it lies on the trachea ; then gets to its side, and is in relation with the oesophagus and thoracic duct : to facilitate the study of these relations, I have arranged them in a tabular form.325 EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY.

The External carotid artery (carotis externa) ascends nearly perpendicularly from opposite the upper border of the thyroid car- tilage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and meatus auditorius, where it divides into two terminal branches, temporal and internal maxillary. Relations.—In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides ; by the hypo- glossal nerve near its origin; higher up it is situated in the sub- stance of the parotid gland, and has in front the facial nerve and temporo-maxillary vein. Behind, it is separated from the internal carotid by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscle, glosso- pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

Branches.—The branches of the external carotid, ten in number, may be arranged into three groups, anterior, posterior, and ascend- ing. They are as follow : A nterior. Posterior. Superior thyroid, Sterno-mastoid, Lingual, Occipital, Facial. Posterior auricular. Ascending. Ascending pharyngeal, Temporal, Parotidean, Internal maxillary. The anterior branches arise from the commencement of the ex- ternal carotid, within a short distance of each other. The lingual and facial bifurcate, not unfrequently, from a common trunk. The Superior thyroid artery (thyroidea superior), the first of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk just below the great cornu of the os hyoides, and curves downwards to the thyroid gland. It is distributed by several large branches (rami thyroidei) to the anterior part of the gland, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. In its course it passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-byoid muscle. Branches.—Hyoid, Inferior laryngeal, Superior laryngeal, Muscular. The Hyoid branch passes forward beneath the thyro-byoideus, and is distributed to the depressor muscles of the os hyoides near their insertion. The Superior laryngeal (laryngea superior) pierces the thyro- hyoidean membrane, in company with the superior laryngeal nerve, and supplies the mucous membrane and muscles of the larynx, sending a branch upwards to the epiglottis. The Inferior laryngeal (crico-tbyroidea) is a small branch which crosses the crico-thyroidean membrane along the lower border of the tbyroid cartilage. It sends branches through tbat membrane to supply the mucous lining of the larynx, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The Muscular branches (rami musculares) are distributed to the depressor muscles of the os hyoides and larynx. One of these branches crosses the sheath of the common carotid to the under surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The Lingual artery (lingualis) ascends obliquely from its origin; it then passes forwards parallel with the great cornu of the os hyoides ; thirdly, it ascends to the under surface of the tongue ; andLINGUAL ARTERY. 327 fourthly, runs forward in a serpentine direction to its tip, under the name of ranine artery (profunda linguae), where it terminates by inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. Relations.—The first part of its course rests on the middle con- strictor muscle of the pharynx, being covered in by the tendon of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoid muscle ; the second is situated between the middle constrictor and hyo-glossus muscle, the latter separating it from the hypoglossal nerve ; in the third, part of its course it lies between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus ; and in the fourth (ranine), rests on the lingualis to the tip of the tongue.

The Hyoid branch (hyoidea) runs along the upper border of the os hyoides, and is distributed to the elevator muscles of the os hyoides near their insertion, inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. The Dorsalis lingua ascends along the posterior border of the . hyo-glossus muscle to the dorsum of the tongue, and is distributed, to the tongue, fauces, and epiglottis ; anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The Sublingual branch (sublingualis) runs forward on the genio- hyo-glossus muscle, and is distributed to the sublingual gland and muscles of the tongue. It is situated between the mylo-hyoideus and genio-hyo-glossus, generally accompanies Wharton's duct for a part of its course, and sends a branch to the frsenum linguae. The latter branch affords the considerable haemorrhage which sometimes follows the old operation of snipping the fraenum in children. Facial artery.—The facial artery (maxillaris externa ; labialis) arises immediately above tbe lingual and a little above the great cornu of the os hyoides, and passes forwards to the submaxillary gland, in which it lies embedded. It then curves around the body of the lower jaw, close to the anterior inferior angle of the masseter muscle, ascends to the angle of the mouth, and thence to the angle of the eye, where it is named, angular artery. The facial artery is tortuous in its course over the buccinator muscle, to accommo- date itself to the movements of the jaw. Relations.—Below the jaw it passes beneath the cligastricus and stylo-hyoid muscle ; on the body of the lower jaw it is covered by the platysma myoides, and at the angle of the mouth by the de- pressor anguli oris and zygomatic muscles. It rests on the sub- maxillary gland, lower jaw, buccinator, orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris proprius, and levator labii supe- rioris alseque nasi. Its branches may be grouped into those which are given off below the jaw, and those on the face; they may be thus arranged :— The Inferior palatine branch (palatina ascendens; pharyngo-pala- tina) ascends between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, to be distributed to the tonsil and soft palate, and anastomoses with the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The Tonsillar branch (tonsillaris) ascends by the side of the pharynx, and pierces the superior constrictor muscle to be distri- buted to the tonsil. Below the Jaw.

The Submental branch (submentalis) runs forward on the mylo-. hyoid muscle, under cover of the body of the lower jaw, and anastomoses with branches of the sublingual and inferior dental artery. The Muscular branches (musculares) are distributed to the mas- seter, pterygoideus internus, digastricus, and stylo-hyoideus. The Buccal branches (buccales), eight or ten in number, are given off upon the face, and are distributed to the buccinator, mas- seter, muscles of the upper lip, orbicularis palpebrarum, and in- tegument of the cheek. They anastomose with the buccal branch of the internal maxillary, the transverse facial, and infraorbital. The Inferior labial branch (labialis inferior) passes forward be- neath the depressor anguli oris muscle, and is distributed to the muscles of the lower lip, inosculating with the labial branch of the inferior dental, and the inferior coronary. The Inferior coronary branch (coronaria labii inferioris) is given off at the angle of the mouth, and passes inwards near the edge of the lower lip, lying between the orbicularis and mucous membrane : it inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The Superior coronary branch (coronaria labii superioris), arising close to, or in common with the preceding, takes its course in the same manner along the upper lip, inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. At the middle of the lip it sends a small branch upwards to the septum of the nose (arteria septi). The Lateral nasal branch (nasalis lateralis vel externa) is given off near the ala nasi, and passes beneath the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, to be distributed to the nose. It inosculates with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The Inosculations of the facial artery are numerous, namely, with the sublingual branch of the lingual, ascending pharyngeal artery, descending palatine artery, inferior dental at its escape from the mental foramen, infraorbital at the infraorbital foramen, trans- verse facial on the side of the face, and nasal and frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery at the angle of the eye. The facial artery is subject to variety in length : it not unfre- quently terminates at the angle of the nose or mouth, and is rarely symmetrical on both sides of the face. The Sterno-MASTOid artery turns downwards from its origin, to be distributed to the sterno-mastoid muscle, and lymphatic glands of the neck ; sometimes there are two branches. The Occipital artery (occipitalis), smaller than the anterior branches, passes backwards behind the parotid gland and beneath the posterior belly of the digastricus, trachelo-mastoideus, and sterno-mastoideus to the occipital groove in the mastoid portion of330 POSTERIOR AURICULAR.—ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL. the temporal bone. It then ascends between tbe splenitis and com- plexus, pierces the trapezius, and is distributed to the back of the head (ramus occipitalis), anastomosing with the opposite occipital, posterior auricular, and temporal artery. The hypoglossal nerve curves around this artery opposite the angle of the jaw and near its origin from the external carotid. Branches.—It gives off several muscular branches (cervicales) to the sterno-inastoideus, digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and deep muscles in its course, a small branch to the external ear, and two larger branches, inferior meningeal and princeps cervicis. The Inferior meningeal ascends by the side of the internal jugular vein, and passes through the foramen lacerum posterius, to be distributed to the dura mater. The Arteria princeps cervicis (cervicalis profundus superior) is a large and irregular branch. It descends the neck between the com- plexus and semi-spinalis colli, and inosculates with the cervicalis profunda of the subclavian and with branches of the vertebral. This branch is the means of establishing an important collateral circulation between the branches of the carotid and subclavian, after ligature of the common carotid artery. The Posterior auricular artery (auricularis posterior) arises from the external carotid, above the level of the digastricus and stylo-hyoideus muscle, and ascends by the side of the styloid pro- cess and behind the parotid gland, to the back part of the concha. It is distributed by two branches, to the external ear ramus auricularis, and side of the head ramus occipitalis, anastomosing with the occipital and temporal artery; some of its branches pass through fissures in the fibro-cartilage, to reach the anterior surface of the pinna. The anterior auricular arteries are branches of the temporal. Branches.—The posterior auricular gives off a branch to the digastricus muscle, and several branches to the parotid gland; it then gives off the stylo-mastoidea, which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen to be distributed to the aquaeductus Fallopii, labyrinth, mastoid cells, and tympanum; a twig accompanies the chorda tympani under the name of tympanica superior. The Ascending pharyngeal artery (pharyngea ascendens), the smallest of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk near its origin, and ascends between the internal carotid and side of the pharynx to the base of the skull, where it divides into two branches; meningeal (meningea posterior), which enters the foramen lacerum posterius, to be distributed to the dura mater; and pharyngeal. It supplies the pharynx, tonsils, soft palate, and Eustachian tube. The Parotidean arteries (parotidese) are four or five large branches which are given off from the external carotid whilst inTEMPORAL.—INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. * 331 the parotid gland. They are distributed to the structure of the gland, their terminal branches reaching the integument of the side of the face, and masseter muscle (rami masseterici posteriores). The Temporal artery (temporalis) is one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid. It ascends over the root of the zygoma ; and, at about an inch and a half above the zygomatic arch, divides into an anterior and posterior temporal branch. The anterior temporal (temporalis superficialis anterior, vel frontalis) is distributed over the front of the temple and arch of the skull, and anastomoses with the opposite anterior temporal, and with the supraorbital and frontal artery. The posterior temporal (tempo- ralis superficialis posterior, vel occipitalis) curves upwards and backwards, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, with the posterior auricular and occipital artery. The trunk of the temporal artery is covered by the parotid gland and attrahens aurem muscle, and rests on the temporal fascia. The Branches of the temporal artery are, some small offsets to the parotid gland and articulation of the lower jaw, and the fol- lowing : Anterior auricular, Transversa faciei, j Orbital, Middle temporal. The Anterior auricular branches (auriculares anteriores), two in number, are distributed to the anterior portion of the pinna. The Orbital branch (zygomatico-orbitalis; supra-orbitalis ex- terna) passes forward immediately above the zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, and inosculates beneath the orbi- cularis palpebrarum with the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The Transversa faciei arises from the temporal immediately below the zygoma, and runs transversely across the face, resting on the masseter muscle, and lying parallel with and a little above Stenon's duct. It anastomoses with the facial and infraorbital artery. The Middle temporal branch (temporalis media) passes through an opening in the temporal fascia immediately above the zygoma, and supplies the temporal muscle inosculating with the deep tem- poral arteries. The Internal maxillary artery (maxillaris interna), the other terminal branch of the external carotid, has next to be examined. Dissection.—The internal maxillary artery passes inwards be- hind the neck of the lower jaw to the deep structures in the face; we require, therefore, to remove several parts for the purpose of seeing it completely. To obtain a good view of the vessel, the zygoma should be sawn across in front of the external ear, and the malar bone near the orbit. Turn down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle. In doing this, a small artery and nerve will be seen crossing the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, to enter theINTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 332 artery. masseter muscle (masseteric). Cut away the tendon of the tem- poral muscle from its insertion into the coronoid process, and turn it upwards towai-ds its origin; some vessels will be seen entering its under surface; these are the deep temporal. Then saw the ramus of the jaw across its middle, and dislocate it from its articulation with the temporal bone. Be careful in doing this to carry the blade of the knife close to the bone, lest any branches of nerves should be injured. Next raise this portion of bone, and with it the exter- nal pterygoid muscle. The artery, together with the deep branches of the inferior maxillary nerve, will be seen lying on the pterygoid muscles. These are to be carefully freed from fat and cellular tissue, and then examined. The internal maxillary artery commences in the substance of the parotid gland, opposite the meatus auditorius externus; it passes in the first instance horizontally forward behind the neck of the lower jaw ; next, curves around the lower border of the external pterygoid muscle near its insertion, and ascends obliquely forwards upon the outer side of that muscle; it then passes inwards between the two heads of the external pterygoid, and enters the spheno- maxillary fossa. Occasionally it takes its course between the two pterygoid muscles, without appearing on the outer surface of the external pterygoid. For the purposes of description it admits of division into three portions: maxillary, pterygoid, and spheno- maxillary. Relations.—The maxillary portion is situated between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament and inferior dental nerve, and lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve; the ptery- goid portion between the external pterygoid muscle, and the mas- seter and temporal muscle. The spheno-maxillary portion lies between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and, in the spheno-maxillary fossa, is in relation with Meckel's ganglion. Branches.—Maxillary Portion. Pterygoid Portion. Tympanic, Deep temporal, Inferior dental, Pterygoid, Arteria meningea media, Masseteric, Arteria meningea parva. Buccal. Spheno-maxillary Portion. Superior dental, Spheno-palatine, Infra-orbital, Superior palatine, Pterygopalatine, Vidian. The Tympanic branch (arteria cavi tympani) passes into the tympanum through the fissura Grlaseri, and is distributed to the laxator tympani, and membrana tympani; on the latter it inoscu- lates with the stylo-mastoid, a branch of the posterior auricularINTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 333 The Inferior dental (maxillaris vel alveolaris inferior) descends to the dental foramen, and enters the canal of the lower jaw in company with the inferior dental nerve. Opposite the bicuspid teeth it divides into two branches, one of which is continued onwards within the bone as far as the symphysis, to supply the incisor teeth ; while the other, mentalis, escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen, and anastomoses with the inferior labial and submental branch of the facial. It supplies the alveoli (rami alveolares) and teeth of the lower jaw, sending small branches along the canals in their roots. At the inferior dental foramen, it gives off a mylo-hyoid branch, which accompanies the mylo- hyoidean nerve. The Arteria meningea media ascends behind the temporo- maxillary articulation to the foramen spinosum in the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and entering the cranium, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch crosses the great ala of the sphenoid to the groove or canal in the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and divides into branches which ramify on the external surface of the dura mater, and anastomose with corresponding branches from the opposite side. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal bone, to the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of the arteria meningea media are distributed chiefly to the bones of the skull; in the middle fossa it sends a small petrosal branch through the hiatus Fallopii to the facial nerve, and branches to the Casserian ganglion. The Meningea parva is a small branch which ascends to the foramen ovale, and passes into the skull to be distributed to the Casserian ganglion and dura mater. It gives off a twig to the nasal fossae and soft palate. The Muscular branches (musculares) are distributed, as their names imply, to the five muscles of the maxillary region; the temporal branches (temporales profundse) are two in number; they inosculate with the middle temporal. The pterygoid branches are distributed to the two muscles of that name. The masseteric artery passes outwards, behind the tendon of the temporal muscle and over the sigmoid notch, to the masseter muscle. The buccal branch, arising opposite the anterior part of the pterygoid muscle, passes downwards with the buccal nerve to the buccinator muscle. It inosculates with the facial and transverse facial artery. The Superior dental artery (supramaxillaris vel alveolaris supe- rior) is given off from the internal maxillary, just as that vessel is about to make its turn inwards to reach the spheno-maxillary fossa. It descends on the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and sends its branches through several small foramina to supply the posterior teeth of the upper jaw, and the antrum. The terminal branches are continued forwards on the alveolar process, to be distributed to the gums and sockets of the teeth.334 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The Infraorbitalis appears, from its size, to be the proper con- tinuation of the artery. It runs along the infraorbital canal with the superior maxillary nerve, sending branches upwards into the orbit, and downwards, through canals in the bone, to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum and the teeth of the upper jaw, and emerges on the face at the infraorbital foramen. The branch which supplies the incisor teeth is the anterior dental artery; on the face the infraorbital inosculates with the facial and transverse facial artery. The Pterygo-palatine (pharyngea suprema vel descendens) is a small branch which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal, and supplies the mucous membrane of the posterior part of the nares, upper part of the pharynx, Eustachian tube, and sphenoidal cells. The Spkeno-palatine, or posterior nasal (nasalis posterior; spheno-palatina), enters the superior meatus of the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen, in company with the nasal filaments of Meckel's ganglion, and divides into two branches; one branch, arteria septi, is distributed to the mucous membrane of the septum, and inosculates in the anterior palatine canal with the terminal branch of the descending palatine ; the other, nasalis posterior externa, supplies the mucous membrane of the lateral wall of the nares, antrum, and sphenoid and ethmoid cells. The Superior or descending palatine artery (palatina superior vel descendens) descends along the posterior palatine canal, in company with the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion, to the posterior palatine foramen; it then bends forward, lying in a groove of the bone, and is distributed to the palate. While in the posterior palatine canal it sends several twigs backwards through the small posterior palatine foramina to supply the soft palate; anteriorly it distributes a branch, palatina anterior, to the anterior palatine canal, which reaches the nares and inosculates with the arteria septi. The Vidian or pterygoid branch passes backwards along the pterygoid canal, and is distributed to the sheath of the Vidian nerve, the Eustachian tube, and mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx. INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The internal carotid artery (carotis interna) curves slightly out- wards from the bifurcation of the common carotid, and ascends nearly perpendicularly by the side of the pharynx, to the carotid foramen in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It next passes inwards, along the carotid canal, forwards by the side of the sella turcica, and upwards by the anterior clinoid process, where it pierces the dura mater, and divides into three terminal branches. The course of this artery is remarkable for the number of angular curves which it forms ; one or two of these flexures are sometimes335 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. seen in the cervical portion, near the base of the skull; and, by the side of the sella turcica, it resembles the italic letter s, placed horizontally. Relations.—In consideration of its connexions, the artery is divisible into a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral portion. The Cervical portion is in relation posteriorly with the rectus anticus major, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and pharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerve which cross behind it. Internally it is in relation with the side of the pharynx, tonsil, and ascending pharyngeal artery. Externally with the internal jugular vein, glosso-pharyngeal, pneuraogastric, and hypoglossal nerve; and in front with the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, stylo-hyoid ligament, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and parotid gland.

The Petrous portion is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a periosteal lining derived from the dura mater; it is in relation with the carotid plexus, and is covered in by the Casserian ganglion. The Cavernous portion is situated in the cavernous sinus, and is in relation by its inner side with the lining membrane of the sinus, and by its outer side with the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. The Cerebral portion of the artery is enclosed in a sheath of the arachnoid, and is in relation with the optic nerve. At its point of division it is situated in the fissure of Sylvius. Branches.—The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches : from the other portions are derived the following:— Tympanic, Anterior cerebral, Arterise receptaculi, Middle cerebral, Ophthalmic, Posterior communicating, Choroidea anterior.OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. 336 The Tympanic is a small branch given off in the carotid canal; it enters the tympanum and inosculates with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. The Arterice receptaculi anterior and posterior are two small branches given off in the cavernous sinus and distributed to the parts contained in the sinus, to the Casserian ganglion, and dura mater; one of the twigs distributed to the latter is the anterior meningeal artery. The Ophthalmic artery (ophthalmica) arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel pierces the dura mater, and enters the orbit through the foramen opticum, lying externally to the optic nerve. It then crosses the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit; and runs along the lower border of the superior oblique muscle, to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal branches, frontal and nasal. Branches.—The branches of the ophthalmic artery, ten in num- ber, may be arranged into two groups : first, those distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts ; and, secondly, those which supply the muscles and globe of the eye. They are— First Group. Second Group. Lachrymal, Muscular,—anterior ciliary, Supra-orbital, Ciliary short and long, • Posterior ethmoidal, Centralis retinas. Anterior ethmoidal, Palpebral, Frontal, Nasal. The Lachrymal (lachrymalis) is the first branch of the ophthal- mic artery, and is usually given off immediately before that artery enters the optic foramen. It follows the course of the lachrymal nerve, above the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. The small branches which escape from the gland supply the conjunctiva and upper eyelid. The lachrymal artery gives off a malar branch which passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa, and inosculates with the deep temporal arteries, while some of its branches become subcu- taneous on the cheek, and anastomose with the tranversa faciei. The Supraorbital artery (supraorbitalis) follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpebrse muscle; it passes through the supraorbital foramen, and divides into a superficial and deep branch, which are distributed to the muscles and integu- ment of the forehead, and to the pericranium. At the supraorbital foramen it sends a branch inwards to the diploe. The Ethmoidal arteries (ethmoidales), posterior and anterior\ pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and are distributed to the falx cerebri and to the ethmoidal cells and nasal fossre. The latter337 OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. accompanies the nasal nerve, and sends a branch to the frontal sinus. The Palpebral arteries (palpebrales), superior and inferior, are given off from the ophthalmic, near the inner angle of the orbit; they encircle the eyelids, forming a superior and an inferior arch (arcus tarseus superior et inferior) near the borders of the lids, between the orbicularis palpebrarum and tarsal cartilage. At the outer angle of the eyelids, the superior palpebral inosculates with the orbital branch of the temporal artery. The inferior palpebral artery sends a branch to the nasal duct. The Frontal artery (frontalis), one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, emerges from the orbit at its inner angle, and ascends along the middle of the forehead. It is distributed to the integument, muscles, and pericranium. The Nasal artery (nasalis vel dorsalis nasi), the other terminal branch of the ophthalmic, passes out of the orbit above the tendo oculi, and divides into two branches; one of which (angularis) in- osculates with the angular artery, while the other, dorsalis nasi, runs along the ridge of the nose, and is distributed to the integu- ment of that organ. The nasal artery sends a small branch to the lachrymal sac. The Muscular branches (rami musculares), usually two in num- ber, superior and inferior, supply the muscles of the orbit; and at the anterior part of the globe of the eye give off the anterior ciliary arteries, which pierce the sclerotic near its margin of connexion with the cornea, and are distributed to the iris. It is the conges- tion of 'these vessels that gives rise to the vascular zone around the cornea in iritis. The Ciliary arteries (ciliares) are divisible into three groups, short, long, and anterior. The Short ciliary (ciliares posticse breves), from ten to fifteen in number, pierce the sclerotic around the entrance of the optic nerve, and supply the choroid coat and ciliary processes. The long ciliary (ciliares posticse longse), two in number, pierce the sclerotic at opposite sides of the globe of the eye, and pass forwards between it and the choroid, to the iris. They form an arterial circle around the circumference of the iris by inosculating with each other, and from this circle branches are given off which ramify in the substance of the iris, and form a second circle around the pupil. The ante- rior ciliary (ciliares anteriores), six to twelve in number, are branches of the muscular arteries ; they terminate in the great ar- terial circle of the iris. The Centralis retinae artery pierces the optic nerve obliquely, and passes forwards in the centre of its cylinder to the retina, where it divides into branches, which ramify in the inner layer of that mem- brane. It supplies the retina, hyaloid membrane, and zonula ciliaris; and, by means of a branch sent forwards through the zSUBCLAVIAN AKTEEY. 338 centre of the vitreous humour in a tubular sheath of the hyaloid membrane, the capsule of the lens. The Anterior cerebral artery (cerebri anterior vel corporis callosi) passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain ; then curves backwards along the corpus callosum to its posterior extremity. It gives branches to the olfac- tory and optic nerves, to the under surface of the anterior lobes, the third ventricle, corpus callosum, and inner surface of the hemi- spheres. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected soon after their origin by a short anastomosing trunk, the anterior com-' municating artery (communicans anterior). The Middle cerebral artery (cerebri media vel fossae Sylvii), larger than the preceding, passes outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into three principal branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes of the brain, and the island of Reil. Wear its origin it gives off the numerous small branches which enter the substantia perforata, to be distributed to the corpus striatum. The Posterior communicating artery (communicans posterior), variable in size, sometimes double, and sometimes altogether want- ing, passes backwards and inosculates with the posterior cerebral, a branch of the basilar artery. Occasionally it is so large as to take the place of the posterior cerebral artery. The Choroidea anterior is a small branch which is given off from the internal carotid, near the origin of the posterior communicating artery, and passes beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain to enter the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is distri- buted to the choroid plexus, and to the walls of the middle cornu. SUBCLAVIAN AETEEY. The Subclavian artery (subclavia) on the right side,' arises from .< the arteria innominata, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation ; on the left, from the arch of the aorta. The right is consequently shorter than the left, and situated nearer the anterior wall of the chest; it is also somewhat greater in diameter, from being a branch of a branch, in place of a division from the main trunk. The course of the subclavian artery is divisible, for the sake of precision and surgical observation, into three portions. The first portion of the right and left arteries differs in its course and rela- tions in correspondence with the dissimilarity of origin above referred to. The other two portions are alike on both sides. The first portion, on the right side, ascends obliquely outwards to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side it ascends perpendicularly to the inner border of that muscle. The second portion curves outwards behind the scalenus anticus ; the third portion passes downwards and outwards beneath the clavicle, to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery.339 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Relations.—The first portion, on the right side, is in relation, in front, with the internal jugular and vertebral vein, and is crossed by the pneumogastric nerve, phrenic nerve, and one or two branches of the sympathetic. Behind and beneath it is invested by the pleura, is crossed by the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, and is in relation farther back with the sympathetic nerve, longus colli muscle, and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The first por- tion on the left side is in relation in front with the pleura, internal jugular vein, vena innominata, and pneumogastric and phrenic nerve (which lie parallel to it). To its inner side is the left carotid artery, trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct ; to its outer side the pleura ; and behind, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, longus colli, and vertebral column.

The scalenus anticus separates it from the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein, which latter is rather below the level of the artery. The third portion of the artery is situated in the subclavian z 2VEKTEBRAL ARTERY. 340 triangle, and is more superficial than the rest. In front it is covered by the integument, platysma, and deep fascia, and crossed by the supraclavicular nerves. Lower down it is crossed by the suprascapular artery and vein, and gets behind the subclavius muscle and clavicle. Behind, it has the scalenus medius ; above, the brachial plexus ; and below, the first rib and subclavian vein. Plan of the Relations of the third portion of the Subclavian Artery. Above.

Three are given off by the first portion of the artery ; one, the superior intercostal, by the second portion; when a fifth artery exists, it arises from the third portion, and is the suprascapular. In a tabular form the branches are as follow : Vertebral, Internal mammary, ( Inferior thyroid, Thyroid axis < Suprascapular, ( Transversa colli. Superior intercostal,—Cervicalis profunda. The Vertebral artery (vertebralis), the first and largest of the branches of the subclavian artery, arises from the posterior aspect of that trunk ; it ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebras, excepting the last; then winds backwards around the articulating process of the atlas ; and, piercing the dura mater, enters the skull through the foramen magnum. The two arteries unite at the lower border of the pons Varolii, to form the basilar artery. In the foramina of the trans- verse processes of the vertebras the artery lies in front of the cervical nerves, and, on the left side, it is crossed by the thoracic duct. Dr. John Davy*" has observed, that when the vertebral arteries differ in size, the left is generally the larger; thus in ninety-eight cases he found the left vertebral the larger twenty-six times, and * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1839.BASILAR ARTERY. 341 the right only eight. In the same number of cases he found a small band stretching across the cylinder of the basilar artery, near the junction of the two vertebral arteries, seventeen times ; and, in a few instances, a small communicating trunk between the two vertebral arteries previously to their union. I have several times seen this communicating branch. The Basilar artery (basilaris, meso-cephalica), so named from its position at the base of the brain, runs forward in the groove on the midline of the pons Varolii, and at the anterior border of the pons divides into four ultimate branches, two to either side. Branches.—The branches of the vertebral and basilar artery are t he following :— Vertebral. Basilar. Lateral spinal, Transverse, Posterior meningeal, Superior cerebellar, Anterior spinal, Posterior cerebral. Posterior spinal, Inferior cerebellar. The Lateral spinal branches (spinales laterales) enter the inter- vertebral foramina, and taking the course of the roots of the spinal nerves, are distributed to the spinal cord and vertebra?. Where the vertebral artery curves around the articular process of the atlas, it gives off several muscular branches (rami musculares). The Posterior meningeal (meningea posterior) are one or two small branches which enter the cranium through the foramen mag- num, to be distributed to the dura mater of the cerebellar fossae, and to the falx cerebelli. One branch, described by Soemmering, passes into the cranium along the first cervical nerve. The Anterior spinal (spinalis anterior) is a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side, on the front of the medulla oblongata. The artery formed by the union of these two vessels descends along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, to which it distributes branches. The Posterior spinal (spinalis posterior) winds around the medulla oblongata to the posterior aspect of the cord, and descends on either side to the cauda equina. It communicates very freely with the spinal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and. near its origin sends a branch upwards to the fourth ventricle. The Inferior cerebellar arteries (cerebelli inferior posterior vel magna) wind around the upper part of the medulla oblongata to the under surface of the cerebellum, to which they are distributed. They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve in their course, and anastomose with the superior cerebellar arteries. The Transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Varolii, and adjacent parts of the brain. One of these branches, larger than the rest, passes along the crus cerebelli to be distributed to the anterior border of the cerebellum (a. cerebelli inferior,CIRCLE OF WILLIS. .342 anterior). This artery gives off a small branch, auditiva interna, which accompanies the facial and auditory nerves into the meatus auditorius internus; the auditory branch may be derived directly from the basilar. The Superior cerebellar arteries (cerebelli superior), two of the terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are dis- Fig. 152 * * Circle of Willis.

The Posterior cerebral arteries (cerebri posterior yel profunda), the other two terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri at each side, and are distributed to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. They are separated from the superior cerebellar arteries near their origin, by the third pair of nerves, and are in close relation with the fourth pair in their course around the crura cerebri. Anteriorly, near their origin, they give off a tuft of small vessels which enter the locus perforatus, and they receive the pos- terior communicating arteries from the internal carotid. They also send a branch to the velum interpositum and plexus choroides, choroidea posterior. The communications established between the anterior cerebral arteries in front, and the internal carotids and posterior cerebral arteries behind, by the communicating arteries, constitute the circle of Willis (circulus arteriosus Willisii). This remarkable vascular communication at the base of the brain is formed by the anterior communicating branch, anterior cerebrals, and internal carotid arteries in front, and by the posterior communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery behind. The Internal mammary artery (mammaria vel thoracica interna) arises from the under side of the subclavian, and passes down behind the subclavian vein to the cartilage of the first rib. It then descends by the side of the sternum, resting on the cartilages of the ribs, to the sheath of the rectus, where, under the name of superior epigastric, it terminates by inosculating with the epigastric branch of the external iliac. As the artery enters the chest it is crossed by the phrenic nerve; it then gets under cover of the pleura, and lower down lies between the triangularis sterni and internal intercostal muscles ; in the sheath of the rectus it sends branches to the walls of the abdomen. The Branches of the internal mammary are,—■ Comes nervi phrenici, Anterior intercostal, Mediastinal, Perforating, Pericardiac, Musculo-phrenic. The Comes nervi phrenici (phrenica superior), a long and slender branch given off by the artery as it enters the chest, descends with the phrenic nerve between the pleura and pericardium to the dia- phragm, to which it is distributed, inosculating with the musculo- phrenic and abdominal phrenic arteries. The mediastinal and pericardiac branches are small vessels dis- tributed to the anterior mediastinum, pericardium, and thymus gland (thymicos). Some sternal branches are sent to supply the sternum and triangularis sterni muscle. The Anterior intercostals (intercostales anteriores) supply the344 THYEOID AXIS.—INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY. intercostal muscles of the front of the chest, and inosculate with the aortic intercostals ; to each space there are two arteries which ran along the borders of the rib. Besides supplying the intercostal muscles, they send branches to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. The Perforating arteries (mammary) pass forward to the front of the chest through the first six intercostal spaces ; they then turn outwards, and after giving some branches to the front of the sternum, are distributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. Those intended for the mammary gland are of larger size than the rest. The Musculo-phrenic artery, proceeding from the internal mam- mary at the interspace between the sixth and seventh rib, passes downwards and outwards over the cartilages of the false ribs to the last intercostal space. It pierces the diaphragm at the attachment of that muscle to the eighth rib, and sends branches to its mus- cular structure, and others to the intercostal spaces of the false ribs. " The mammary arteries," says Dr. Harrison, " are remarkable for the number of their inosculations, and for the distant parts of the arterial system which they serve to connect. They anastomose with each other, and their inosculations, with the thoracic aorta, encircle the thorax. On the parietes of this cavity their branches connect the axillary and subclavian arteries ; on the diaphragm they form a link in the chain of inosculations between the subclavian artery and abdominal aorta ; and in the parietes of the abdomen they form an anastomosis most remarkable for the distance between those vessels which it serves to connect; namely, the arteries of the superior and inferior extremities." The Thyroid axis is a short trunk which arises from the front of the subclavian close to the inner border of the anterior scalenus, and divides almost immediately into three branches, inferior thyroid, supra-scapular, and transversa colli. The Inferior thyroid artery (thyroidea inferior) ascends ob- liquely in a serpentine course behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, and in front of the longus colli, to the inferior and posterior part of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed. It is in rela- tion with the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, which lies in front of it; and sends branches to the trachea, larynx, and oesophagus. Near its origin it gives off the following branch. The Cervicalis ascendens, a branch of the inferior thyroid, ascends upon the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, lying in the groove between the scalenus anticus and rectus anticus major. It is distributed to the deep muscles and glands of the neck, and sends branches through the intervertebral foramina to supply the spinal cord and its membranes.TRANSVERSA COLLI ARTERY. 345 The Supra-scapular artery (transversa scapulae ; scapularis superior) passes obliquely outwards behind the clavicle, and over the ligament of the supra-scapular notch, to the supra-spinatus fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus muscle, phrenie nerve, and subclavian artery ; is distributed to the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and inosculates with the posterior scapular, and beneath the acromion process with the dorsal branch of the sub- scapular artery. At the supra-scapular notch it sends a large branch outwards, which pierces the trapezius muscle, and becomes cutaneous at the tip of the shoulder (acromialis). The supra- scapular artery sometimes arises directly from the subclavian. Fig. 153. The Transversa colli artery (scapularis posterior) passes transversely across the subclavian triangle at the root of the neck, to the anterior border of the levator anguli sca- pula?, where it divides into two terminal branches, the cervicalis superficialis and posterior scapular. In its course it lies above the supra-scapular artery, and crosses the scaleni muscles and brachial plexus of nerves, often passing be- tween the latter. At its bifurcation it is covered in by the edge of the tra- pezius. The Cervicalis superfi- cialis artery (cervicalis posterior), its ascending branch, passes upwards under cover of the anterior border of the trapezius, and is distributed to the superficial muscles of the neck and deep cervical glands. The Posterior scapular artery (dorsalis scapulas, Tiedemann), the proper continuation of the transversa colli, passes backwards to the superior angle of the scapula, and then descends along the pos- terior border of that bone to its inferior angle, where it inosculates with the subscapular artery. In its course it lies under cover of the levator anguli scapulae and rhomboidei muscles, distributes branches * Branches of the right subclavian artery. 1. Arteria innominata. 2. Eight carotid. 3.

The cervicalis superficialis and posterior scapular artery some- times arise separately, the former from the thyroid axis, the latter from the third portion of the subclavian. By means of its nume- rous inosculations the transversa colli artery maintains an important anastomotic communication between the branches of the external carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The Superior intercostal artery (intercostalis suprema) arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anticus, and, descending in front of the necks of the first two ribs, sends intercostal branches to the first two intercostal spaces, and dorsal branches to the muscles and integument of the back. The artery lies behind the pleura, to the outer side of the sympathetic nerve, and in the second intercostal space inosculates with the first aortic intercostal. It gives off the cervicalis pro- funda. The Cervicalis profunda artery (profunda cervicis) arises by a common trunk with the preceding, or, more properly, is a branch of the superior intercostal, corresponding with the posterior branch of the other intercostal arteries. It passes backwards between the transverse processes of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebra, and ascends the back part of the neck, between the com- plexus and semispinalis colli muscle. It inosculates with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery, and with branches of the vertebral. Varieties of the subclavian arteries.—Varieties in these arteries are rare ; that which most frequently occurs is the origin of the right subclavian from the left extremity of the arch of the aorta, below the left subclavian artery. The vessel, in this case, curves behind the oesophagus and right carotid artery, and sometimes be- tween the oesophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib on the right side of the chest, where it assumes its ordinary course. In a case of subclavian aneurism on the right side above the clavicle, which happened during the summer of 1839, Mr. Liston proceeded to perform the operation of tying the carotid and subclavian arteries at their point of division from the innominata. Upon reaching the spot where the bifurcation should have existed, he found that there was no subclavian artery. With his usual self- possession he continued his dissection more deeply, towards the vertebral column, and succeeded in securing the arteiy. It was ascertained after death, that the arteria innominata was extremely short, and that the subclavian was given off within the chest from the posterior aspect of its trunk, and pursued a deep course to the upper margin of the first rib. In a preparation which was shown me at Heidelberg, some years since, by Professor Tiedemann, the right subclavian artery arose from the thoracic aorta, as low down347 AXILLARY ARTERY. as tlie fourth dorsal vertebra, and ascended from that point to the border of the first rib. Varieties in the branches of the subclavian are not unfrequent; the most interesting is the origin of the left vertebral from the arch of the aorta. AXILLARY ARTERY. The Axillary artery (axillaris) passes outwards and downwards with a gentle curve through the axillary space from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the tendons of the latis- simus dorsi and teres major, where it becomes the brachial. Relations.—After emerging from beneath the margin of the costo-coracoid membrane, it is in relation with the axillary vein, which lies at'first to the inner side, and then in front of the artery. Near the middle of the axilla it is embraced by the two heads of the median nerve, and covered in by the pectoral muscles. On the inner or thoracic side it is in relation, first, with the first inter- costal muscle ; it next rests on the first serration of the serratus magnus; and is then separated from the chest by the brachial plexus of nerves. By its outer or humeral side it is at first sepa- rated from the brachial plexus by a triangular interval of cellular tissue ;i it next rests against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle; and thirdly, upon the coraco-brachialis muscle. The relations of the axillary artery may be thus arranged :— In Front. Inner or Thoracic Side. Outer or Humeral Side. Pectoralis major, First intercostal muscle, Plexus of nerves, Pectoralis minor, First serration of ser- Tendon of sub- Pectoralis major. ratus magnus, scapularis, Plexus of nerves. Coraco-brachialis. Branches.—The branches of the Axillary artery are seven in number :— Superior thoracic, Subscapular, Thoracica acromialis, Circumflex anterior, Long thoracic, Circumflex posterior. Thoracica alaris, The superior thoracic and thoracica acromialis are found in the triangular space above the pectoralis minor. The inferior thoracic and thoracica alaris, below the pectoralis minor. And the three remaining branches below the lower border of the subscapularis. The Superior- thoracic (suprema ; short thoracic), the highest of the branches of the axillary, and sometimes derived from the next, passes inwards to the chest in front of the pectoralis minor muscle, and is distributed to the pectoral muscles and walls of the chest. It anastomoses with the intercostal and mammary arteries. The Thoracica acromialis (thoracica humeraria) is a short trunk which proceeds from the axillary in the space above the pectoralis minor muscle, and divides into three sets of branches, pectoral,348 AXILLARY ARTERY. which are distributed to the pectoral muscles, serratus magnus, and mammary gland ; acromial (r. transversus), which pass outwards to the acromion, and inoscu- ■%-X54* late with branches of the supra-scapular artery ; and descending (r. deltoideus), a single branch, which follows the interspace between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscle, and is in relation with the cephalic vein. The Long thoracic (tho- racica inferior; mammaria externa) descends along the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the chest. It is distributed to the pec- toralis major and minor, ser- ratus magnus, and mammary gland ; inosculating with the superior thoracic, intercostal and mammary arteries. The Thoracica alaris is a small branch distributed to the plexus of nerves and glands in the axilla. It is frequently wanting ; its place being supplied by. a branch derived from one of the other thoracic branches. The Subscapular artery (scapularis inferior), the largest of the branches of the axillary, runs along the lower border of the sub- * Axillary and brachial artery, with their branches. 1. Deltoid. 2.

It supplies the muscles of the under surface and inferior border of the scapula, and the side of the chest. At about an inch and a half from the axillary, it gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapulas (circumflexa scapulae), which passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps, and beneath the infra-spinatus muscle to the dorsum of the scapula, where it is distributed, inosculating with the suprascapular and posterior scapular artery. The Circumflex arteries (circumflexse humeri) wind around the neck of the humerus. The anterior, very small, passes beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and sends a branch upwards along the bicipital groove to supply the shoulder-joint. The Posterior circumflex, of larger size, passes backwards through the quadrangular space bounded by the teres minor and major, the scapular head of the triceps, and humerus, and is distributed to the deltoid muscle and shoulder-joint. Sometimes this artery is a branch of the superior profunda of the brachial. It then ascends behind the tendon of the teres major, and is distributed to the deltoid without passing through the quadrangular space. Varieties of the Axillary artery.—The most frequent peculiarity of this kind is the division of the vessel into two trunks of equal size : a muscular trunk, which gives off some of the ordinary axil- lary branches and supplies the upper arm, and a continued trunk, which represents the brachial artery. The next most frequent variety is the high division of the ulnar which passes down the arm by the side of the brachial artery, and superficially to the muscles proceeding from the inner condyle, to its ordinary distribution in the hand. In this course it lies immediately beneath the deep fascia of the forearm, and may be seen and felt pulsating beneath the integument. The high division of the radial from the axillary is rare. In one instance, I saw the axillary artery divide into three branches of nearly equal size, which passed together down the arm, and at the bend of the elbow resolved themselves into radial, ulnar, and interosseous. But the most interesting variety, both in a physiological and surgical sense, is that described by Dr. Jones Quain, in his "Elements of Anatomy." {;I found in the dis- secting-room, a few years ago, a variety not hitherto noticed; it was at first taken for the ordinary high division of the ulnar artery. The two vessels descended from the point of division at the border of the axilla, and lay parallel with one another in their course through the arm ; but instead of diverging, as is usual, at the bend of the elbow, they converged, and united so as to form a short trunk, which soon divided again into the radial and ulnar arteries in the regular way." In a subject, dissected by myself, this variety existed in both arms ; and I have seen several instances of a similar kind.350 BRACHIAL ARTERY. The Brachial artery (brachials ; humeraria) passes down the inner side of the arm, from the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, to a little below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar artery. Relations.—In its course downwards, it rests on the triceps, coraco-brachialis, brachialis anticus, and tendon of the biceps. To its inner side is the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerve ; to the outer side, the coraco-brachialis and biceps ; in front it has the basilic vein, and is crossed by the median nerve. Its relations, within its sheath, are the vense comites. Plan of the Relations of the Brachial Artery. In Front. Basilic vein, Deep fascia, Median nerve. Inner Side. Internal cutaneous nerve, Ulnar nerve. Brachial Artery. Outer Side. Coraco-brachialis, Biceps. Behind. Short head of triceps, Coraco-brachialis, Brachialis anticus, Tendon of biceps. The branches of the brachial artery are, the Superior profunda, Inferior profunda, Anastomotica magna, Muscular and Nutrient. The Superior profunda (brachialis profunda ; profunda humeri) arises opposite the lower border of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and winds around the humerus, between the triceps and the bone, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, where it inosculates with the radial recurrent artery. It accom- panies the musculo-spiral nerve. In its course it gives off the posterior articular artery, which descends to the elbow-joint, and a more superficial branch, which descends by the side of the external intermuscular septum and inosculates with the interosseous articular artery. The inferior muscular branches of the superior profunda inosculate with the inferior profunda, anastomotica magna, and ulnar recurrent. The Inferior profunda (collateralis ulnaris superior) arises from about the middle of the brachial artery, and descends with the ulnar nerve to the space between the inner condyle and olecranon, where it inosculates with the posterior ulnar recurrent. In its course it pierces the intermuscular septum.353 RADIAL ARTERY. the pronator quadratus, and forms an arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal brairch of the ulnar artery. From this arch twigs are given off to supply Fig. 155." the wrist-joint. TheCarpeaposteriorcross.es the carpus transversely, and inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Superiorly it inoscu- lates with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery ; inferiorly it gives off dorsal interosseous branches, which anastomose with the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, and run forward upon the dorsal in- terossei muscles of the third and fourth metacarpal spaces. The Metacarpea or first dorsal interosseous branch runs forward to the metacar- pal space between the index and middle finger. At the cleft of the fingers it inoscu- lates with the palmar digital artery, and gives off dorsal collateral branches. It is joined opposite the heads of * Arteries of the forearm. 1.

The Dorsalis indicis is a very small branch which runs along the radial border of the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the index finger. The Princeps pollicis, the great artery of the thumb, passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, between the first dorsal interosseous (abductor indicis) and flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the first phalanx ; and, between the two heads of the latter muscle, in the groove of the tendon of the flexor longus, it divides into two collateral branches for the palmar borders of the thumb. The Radialis indicis, the digital branch of the radial side of the index finger, is directed inwards, between the abductor indicis and flexor brevis and adductor pollicis, to the side of the finger, along which it runs, forming its radial collateral artery. Near its origin it gives off a small branch (more frequently a direct branch of the radial), which inosculates with the superficial palmar arch. The Inter ossece palmares, three or four in number, are branches of the deep palmar arch ; they pass forward upon the interossei muscles, and inosculate with the digital branches of the superficial arch, opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The P erf or antes, three in number, pass directly backwards between the heads of the dorsal interossei muscles, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The Recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch pass upwards in front of the wrist-joint, and inosculate with the arterial arch formed by the anterior carpal arteries. ULNAR ARTERY. The Ulnar artery (ulnaris; cubitalis), the other and larger division of the brachial, crosses the forearm obliquely to the com- mencement of its middle third ; it then runs down the ulnar side of the forearm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament into the hand, and forms the superficial palmar arch (arcus volaris superfi- cialis), which terminates by inosculating with the superficialis VOl 86. Relations.—In the upper or oblique portion of its course it lies upon the brachialis anticus and flexor profundus digitorum, and is covered in by the superficial layer of muscles of the forearm and median nerve. In the second part of its course, it is placed upon the flexor profundus and pronator quadratus, lying between the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor sublimis digitorum. While crossing the annular ligament it is protected from injury by a strong ten- dinous arch, thrown over it from the pisiform bone ; and in the palm it rests on the tendons of the flexor sublimis, being coveredULNAR ARTERY. 355 in by th-. oalmaris brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accom- panied in i's course by the venae comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two-thirds of its extent; the nerve lying to its ulnar side.

The Anterior ulnar recurrent, arising immediately below the elbow, ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and brachialis anticus ; it distributes branches to the adjacent muscles, and inosculates with the anastomotica magna and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by a com- mon trunk. The Posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the preceding, arises immediately below the elbow-joint, and passes backwards, beneath the origin of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends A a 2INTEROSSEOUS ARTERY. 356 between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, lying beneath the ulnar nerve, and inosculates with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and interosseous recurrent. The Interosseous artery is a short trunk which arises from the ulnar, opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, and passes backwards to the interosseous membrane, where it divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous artery. The Anterior interosseous (interossea interna) passes down the forearm upon the interosseous membrane, between the flexor pro- fundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, and behind the pro- nator quadratus; it then passes through an opening in the inter- osseous membrane to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. The anterior interosseous artery gives off several muscular branches ; nutrient branches to the radius and ulna ; a companion branch to the median nerve ; and at the upper border of the pronator quad- ratus, a small branch, which descends behind that muscle to inosculate with the anterior carpal arteries. The median artery is sometimes of large size, and occasionally takes the place of the superficial palmar arch. The Posterior interosseous artery (interossea externa ; perforans suprema) passes backwards through an opening between the upper part of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament, and descends between the superficial and deep layer of muscles of the forearm to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the an- terior interosseous and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. At its upper part it gives off a recurrent branch, posterior interosseous recurrent, which returns upon the elbow between the anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris and supinator brevis, and anasto- moses with the posterior terminal branches of the superior profunda. The Muscular brandies of the ulnar artery are distributed to the muscles of the ulnar border of the forearm. The Carpea anterior, a branch of small size, passes outwards upon the front of the wrist-joint, and contributes to form the ante- rior carpal arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal branch of the radial artery. The Carpea posterior, larger than the preceding, passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle to the back of the wrist-joint, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery, and forms & posterior carpal arch. The Metacarpea, often a branch of the preceding, passes along the inner border of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and forms the dorsal collateral branch of that finger. The Communicating or deep branch arises close to the annular ligament, and dips between the abductor minimi digiti and flexor brevis to inosculate with the termination of the deep palmar arch. It is accompanied by the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve.357 BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA. The Digital Branches, four in number, are given off from the convexity of the superficial palmar arch. The first and smallest is distributed to the ulnar side of the little finger. The other three are short trunks, which divide between the heads of the metacarpal bones, and form the collateral branch of the radial side of the little finger, the collateral branches of the ring and middle finger, and the collateral branch of the ulnar side of the index finger. On the last phalanx, the collateral arteries communicate and form an arch, from which numerous branches are given off to the tip of the finger. The arteries of the hand are subject to frequent variety of distri- bution. The Pericardiac arteries are a few small and irregular branches distributed to the pericardium. The Bronchial arteries, generally three in number, one for the right lung and two for the left, vary both in size and origin ; the right often proceeding from a short trunk common to it and one of the left bronchial branches, or from the first aortic intercostal. They take their course to the back of the root of the lung, and ac- company the ramifications of the bronchial tubes through its sub- stance ; giving twigs also to the bronchial glands, oesophagus, and pericardium. The (Esophageal arteries (cesophagese), five or six in number, arise from the anterior part of the aorta, and are distributed to the oesophagus, establishing a chain of anastomoses along that tube : the superior inosculate with the bronchial arteries, and with oeso- phageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries; the inferior with similar branches of the phrenic and gastric arteries. The Posterior mediastinal arteries are small twigs distributed to the lymphatic glands and cellular tissue of the posterior medias- tinum. The Intercostal, or posterior intercostal arteries (intercostales inferiores), arise from the posterior part of the aorta ; they are ten in number at each side, the first intercostal space being supplied by the superior intercostal artery, a branch of the subclavian. The right intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta. They ascend somewhat obliquely from their origin, and cross the vertebral column behind the thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and sympathetic nerve, to the intercostal spaces ; the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, vena azygos minor and BRANCHES OP THE THORACIC AORTA. Pericardiac, Bronchial, (Esophageal, Posterior mediastinal, Intercostal.BRANCHES OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. 358 sympathetic. In the intercostal space, or rather on the external intercostal nmscle, each artery gives off a dorsal branch, which passes back between the transverse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the middle costo-transverse ligament, and divides into a spinal branch, which supplies the spinal cord and vertebrae, and a muscular branch, distributed to the muscles and integument of the back. The intercostal artery then comes into relation with its vein and nerve, the former being above, the latter below, and ascends obliquely to the lower border of the rib, with which it comes into relation near the angle of the bone. It then runs along the lower border of the rib, lying between the two planes of intercostal muscles to the front of the chest, where it inosculates with the superior anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary. Besides the dorsal branch and several small muscular branches, the intercostal artery, at about the middle of its course, gives off a large inferior branch, which runs along the upper border of the rib below to the fore part of the chest, and inosculates with the in- ferior anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary. While between the two planes of intercostal muscles, the inter- costal artery is protected from pressure by little tendinous arches thrown across it and attached by each extremity to the bone. _ The upper pair of intercostal arteries inosculate with the superior inter- costals of the subclavian ; the lower intercostals anastomose with the lumbar and epigastric arteries in the parietes of the abdomen. BRANCHES OP THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. Phrenic. !Gastric, Hepatic, Splenic, Superior mesenteric, Spermatic, Inferior mesenteric, Supra-renal, Eenal, Lumbar, Sacra media. The Phrenic arteries (phrenicse ; diaphragmaticse) are given off' (frequently by a common trunk) from the anterior part of the aorta as soon as that vessel has emerged through the aortic opening. Passing obliquely outwards on the under surface of the diaphragm, each artery divides into two branches, an internal branch, which runs forwards and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the oesophageal opening; and an external branch, which proceeds outwards towards the great circumference of the muscle, and sends branches to the supra-renal capsules. The phrenic arteries inosculate with branches of the internal mammary, inter- costal, epigastric, oesophageal, gastric, hepatic, and supra-renal ar- teries. They are not unfrequently derived from the coeliac axis, or359 CCELIAC AXIS.—HEPATIC ARTERY. from one of its divisions, and sometimes they give origin to the supra-renal arteries. The Cceliac axis (coeliaca ; tcoiXia, ventriculus) is the first single trunk given off by the abdominal aorta. It arises opposite the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra, is about half-an-inch in length, and divides into three large branches, gastric, hepatic, and splenic. Relations.—The trunk of the coeliac axis has in relation with it, in front, the lesser omentum ; on the right side, the right semilunar ganglion and lobus Spigelii of the liver; on the left side, the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac portion of the stomach ; and below, the upper border of the pancreas and lesser curve of the stomach. It is completely surrounded by the solar plexus. The Gastric artery (coronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, ascends between the two layers of the lesser omentum to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, then runs along the lesser curvature to the pylorus, and inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. It is distributed to the lower ex- tremity of the oesophagus and lesser curve of the stomach; and anastomoses with the oesophageal arteries, vasa brevia of the splenic artery, and pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The Hepatic artery (hepatica) curves forward, and ascends along the right border of the lesser omentum to the liver, where it divides into two branches (right and left), which enter the trans- verse fissure, and are distributed along the portal canals to the right and left lobes.* It is in relation, in the right border of the lesser omentum, with the ductus communis choledochus and portal vein, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves, and nume- rous lymphatics. There are sometimes two hepatic arteries, in which case one is derived from the superior mesenteric. The Branches of the hepatic artery are, the The Pyloric branch, given off from the hepatic near the pylorus, is distributed to the commencement of the duodenum and to the lesser curve of the stomach, where it inosculates with the gastric artery.

It inosculates infe- riorly with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis and pancreatic branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The Cystic artery, generally a branch of the right hepatic, is of small size, and ramifies between the coats of the gall-bladder, pre- viously to its distribution to the mucous membrane. The Splenic artery (splenica; lienalis), the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes horizontally to the left along the upper border of the pancreas, and divides into five or six .large branches (r. splenici), which enter the hilum of the spleen, and are distributed to its structure. In its course the vessel is tortuous and serpentine, frequently making a complete turn upon itself. It lies in a narrow groove in the upper border of the pancreas, and is accompanied by the splenic vein which lies beneath it, and by the; splenic plexus of nerves. * The Branches of the splenic artery are, the Pancreaticse parva?, Vasa brevia, Pancreatica magna, Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The Pancreatica? parvce are numerous small branches distributed to the pancreas, as the splenic artery runs along its upper borden One of these, larger than the rest, follows the course of the pan- creatic duct, and is called pancreatica magna. The Vasa brevia (gastricse breves) are five or six branches of small size which pass from the extremity of the splenic artery and its terminal branches, between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of the stomach, to which they are dis- tributed, inosculating with branches of the gastric artery and gastro- epiploica sinistra. The Gastro-epiploica sinistra appears to be the continuation of the splenic artery; it, passes forwards from left to right, along the great curve of the stomach, lying between the layers of the great omentum, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra. It is distributed to the greater curve of the stomach and great omentum. The Superior mesenteric artery (mesenterica vel mesaraica superior), the second of the single trunks, and next in size to the coeliac axis, arises from the aorta immediately below that vessel, and behind the pancreas. It passes forwards between the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and descends within the layers of the mesentery, to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates, much reduced in size. In its course it forms a curve, the convexity being to the left, the concavity to the right; is in relation near its com- mencement with the portal vein; and is accompanied by two veins, and the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves.SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 363 The Branches of the superior mesenteric artery are— Pancreatico-duodenalis Ileo-colica, inferior, Colica dextra, Vasa intestini tenuis, Colica media. The Pancreatico-duodenalis inferior is a small branch which arises from the superior mesenteric while behind the pancreas, and curves upwards along the line of junction of the pancreas and duo- Fig. 158* * Course and distribution of the superior mesenteric artery. 1.

The Vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convexity of the supe- rior mesenteric artery. They vary from fifteen to twenty in num- ber, and are distributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the termination of the ileum. In their course between the layers of the mesentery, they form a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches; from these are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches arise which are distributed to the coats of the intestine. From the middle branches a fourth and sometimes even a fifth series of arches is produced. By means of these arches a direct communica- tion is established between all the branches given off from the con- vexity of the superior mesenteric artery; the upper branch inoscu- lates with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis; the lower with the ileo-colica. The Ileo-colic artery is the last branch given off by the concavity of the superior mesenteric. It descends to the right iliac fossa, and divides into branches which communicate and form arches, from which branches are distributed to the termination of the ileum, caecum, and commencement of the colon. This artery inosculates on the one hand with the termination of the mesenteric trunk; on the other, with the colica dextra. The Colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passing outwards behind the peri- toneum, divides into branches which form arches, and are distri- buted to the ascending colon. Its descending branches inosculate with the ileo-colica, the ascending with the colica media. The Colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passes forward .between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, where it forms arches, and is distributed to the transverse colon. It inosculates on the right with the colica dextra; on the left, with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. The Spermatic arteries (spermaticse interna?) are two small vessels which arise from the front of the aorta below the superior mesenteric; from their origin each artery passes obliquely outwards, and accompanies the corresponding ureter along the front of the psoas muscle to the border of the pelvis, where it is in relation with the external iliac artery. It is then directed outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and follows the course of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal and through the scrotum to the testicle, to which it is distributed. The right spermatic artery lies in front of the vena cava, and both vessels are accompanied by veins and by the spermatic plexuses of nerves. The spermatic arteries in the female (ovarian) descend into the pelvis and pass between the two layers of the broad ligaments ofSPERMATIC ARTERIES. 365 the uterus, to be distributed to the broad ligaments, ovaries, Fal- lopian tubes, and round ligaments; along the latter they are con- tinued to the inguinal canal and labium at each side.

The Inferior mesenteric artery (mesenterica inferior), smaller than the superior, arises from the abdominal aorta, about two inches below the origin of the latter vessel, and descends between the layers of the left mesocolon, to the left iliac fossa, where it divides into three branches : Colica sinistra, Sigmoidea, Hsemorrhoidalis superior. The Colica sinistra (superior) is distributed to the descending colon ; it passes upwards and outwards behind the peritoneum, and divides into two branches, one of which (ramus anastomoticus) ascends to inosculate with the colica media, while the other descends to communicate with the sigmoid branch. The inosculation of the colica sinistra with the colica media is the largest arterial anasto- mosis in the body. The Sigmoid artery (colica sinistra inferior) passes obliquely outwards behind the peritoneum and divides into branches which form arches, and are distributed to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. The superior branch inosculates with the colica sinistra, the inferior with the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The Superior hemorrhoidal artery is the continuation of the inferior mesenteric. It crosses the ureter and left common iliac artery, and descending between the two layers of the mesorectum, is distributed to the rectum as far as its middle, anastomosing with the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal arteries. The Supra-renal (suprarenales; capsulares) are two small vessels which arise from the aorta immediately above the renal arteries, and are distributed to the supra-renal capsules. They are sometimes branches of the phrenic or of the renal arteries. The Renal arteries (renales ; emulgentes) are two large trunks given off from the sides of the aorta immediately below the superior mesenteric artery; the right is longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta, and passes behind the vena cava to the kidney of that side. The left is somewhat higher than the right. They divide into several large branches previously to entering the kidney, and ramify very minutely in its vascular portion. The renal arteries supply several small branches to the supra-renal capsules, and one to the ureter. The Lumbar arteries (lumbales) correspond with the inter- costals in the chest; they are four or five in number at each side, curve around the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae beneath the psoas muscles, and divide into two branches ; one, dorsal branch, passes backwards between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the vertebras and spinal cord and muscles of the back ; the other, parietal branch, taking its course behind the quadratus lumborum, supplies the abdominal muscles, and inosculates with branches of the internal mammary and epigastric artery. The first lumbar367 COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. artery runs along the lower border of the last rib ; the last, along the crest of the ilium. In passing between the psoas muscle and the vertebrae, they are protected by a series of tendinous arches, which defend them and the communicating branches of the sym- pathetic nerve from pressure, during the action of the muscle. The Sacra media arises from the posterior part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the middle of the anterior sur- face of the sacrum to the first piece of the coccyx, where it termi- nates by inosculating with the lateral sacral arteries. It distributes branches to the rectum and anterior sacral nerves, and inosculates at either side with the lateral sacral arteries. Varieties in the Branches of the A bdominal A orta. —The phrenic arteries are very rarely both derived from the aorta. One or both may be branches of the cceliac axis ; one may proceed from the gastric artery, from the renal, or from the upper lumbar. There are occasionally three or more phrenic arteries. The cceliac axis is variable in length, and gives off its branches irregularly. There are sometimes two or even three hepatic arteries, one of which may be derived from the gastric or from the superior mesenteric. The colica media is sometimes derived from the hepatic artery. The spermatic arteries are variable both in origin and number. The right spermatic may be a branch of the renal; the left, of the inferior mesenteric. The supra-renal arteries may be derived from the phrenic or renal arteries. The renal arteries present several varieties in number; there may be three or even four on one side, and one only on the other. When there are several renal arteries on one side, one may arise from the common iliac artery, from the front of the aorta near its lower part, or from the internal iliac. COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. The abdominal aorta divides opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries. Sometimes the bifurcation takes place as high as the third, and occasionally as low as the fifth. The common iliac arteries (iliacce communes vel primitives) are about two inches in length ; they diverge from the termination of the aorta, and pass downwards and outwards at each side to the margin of the pelvis, opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis, where they divide into the internal and external iliac. In old persons the com- mon iliac arteries are more or less dilated and curved in their course. The right artery is somewhat longer than the left, and forms a more obtuse angle with the termination of the aorta ; the angle of bifurcation is greater in the female than in the male. Relations.—The relations of the two arteries are different at the two sides of the body. The right common iliac is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed at its bifurcation by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the two common iliac veins, and externally with the psoas magnus. The left is in relation inINTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 368 front with the peritoneum, and is crossed by the rectum and superior hemorrhoidal artery, and, at its bifurcation, by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the left common iliac vein, and externally with the psoas magnus. The Internal iliao artery (iliaca interna; hypogastrica) is a short trunk, varying in length from an inch to two inches. It descends obliquely forwards to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk. In the foetus, the internal iliac artery, under the name of hypogastric or umbilical, is continued onwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder to near its apex, whence it ascends by the side of the linea alba and urachus to the umbilicus, where it becomes the true umbilical artery. After birth, this artery ceases to be pervious beyond the side of the bladder, and the obliterated portion is converted into a fibrous cord. The projection of the two cords on the inner wall of the abdomen causes the depression at each side, which goes by the name of peritoneal fossa. Relations.—This artery rests externally on the sacral plexus and * Iliac arteries. 1. Aorta. 2. Left common iliac artery. 3. External iliac. 4. Epigastric artery. 5. Cireumflexa ilii. 6.

The Inferior hcemorrhoidal arteries (externse) are three or four small branches, given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They cross the ischio-rectal fossa, and are distributed to the anus and to the muscles and integument of the anal region of the perineum. The Superficial perineal artery (perinea) is given off near the attachment of the crus penis ; it pierces the connecting layer of the perineal fascia and triangular ligament, and runs forward across Fig. 161 .* * Arteries of the perineum ; on the right side the superficial arteries are seen, on the left the deep. 1.

B B 2372 LATERAL SACRAL ARTERIES. the trausversus perinei muscle, and along the groove between the accelerator urinse and erector penis to the septum scroti, upon which it ramifies under the name of arteria septi. It distributes branches to the scrotum (scrotales posteriores) and perineum. One of the latter, larger than the rest, crosses the perineum, resting on the transversus perinei muscle, and is named the transversa perinei. There are often two superficial perineal arteries. The Artery of the bulb (bulbo-urethralis) is given off from the pudic nearly opposite the opening for the transmission of the urethra ; it passes almost transversely inwards behind the triangular ligament, and pierces that ligament to enter the corpus spon- giosum at its bulbous extremity. "It is distributed in the corpus spongiosum. The Artery of the corpus cavernosum (profunda penis) pierces the crus penis, and runs forward in the interior of the corpus caver- nosum, by the side of the septum pectiniforme. It ramifies in the parenchyma of the venous structure of the corpus cavernosum. The Dorsal artery of the penis (dorsalis penis) ascends between the two crura and symphysis pubis to the dorsum penis, and runs forward through the suspensory ligament, in the groove of the corpus cavernosum, to the glans, distributing branches in its course to the body of the organ and integument. The Internal pudio artery in the female is smaller than in the male ; its branches, with their distribution, are, in principle, the same. The superficial perineal artery supplies the analogue of the lateral half of the scrotum, namely, the greater labium. The artery of the bulb supplies the commencement of the vagina ; the artery of the corpus cavernosum, the cavernous body of the clitoris ; and the arteria dorsalis clitoridis, the dorsum of that organ. Branches of the posterior trunk. The Ilio-lumbar artery (ileo-lombalis) ascends beneath the ex- ternal iliac vessels and psoas muscle, to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, where it divides into two branches, a lumbar branch which supplies the psoas and quadratus lumborum, and sends a ramuscule through the fifth intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and its membranes ; and an iliac branch (r. transver- salis) which crosses the iliac fossa to the crest of the ilium, and inosculates with the lumbar arteries and circumflexa ilii; in its course it distributes branches to the iliacus and abdominal muscles. The Lateral sacral arteries (sacrales laterales) are generally two in number on each side, superior and inferior. The superior passes inwards to the first sacral foramen, and is distributed to the contents of the spinal canal, from which it escapes by the posterior sacral foramen, and supplies the integument of the dorsum of the373 EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. sacrum. The inferior passes down by the side of the anterior sacral foramina to the coccyx ; it first pierces and then rests on the origin of the pyriformis, and sends twigs into the sacral canal to supply the sacral nerves. Both arteries inosculate with each other and with the sacra media. The Gluteal artery (glutsea superior) is the continuation of the ^ posterior trunk of the internal iliac ; it passes backwards between - the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerve through the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen and above the pyriformis muscle, and divides into three branches, superficial, deep superior, and deep inferior ; while within the pelvis it gives off some muscular twigs to the iliacus and pyriformis, and at its escape from the pelvis, a nutritious artery to the ilium. The Superficial branch passes backwards between the gluteus maximus and medius, and is distributed to the gluteus maximus and to the integument of the gluteal and sacral region. The Deep superior branch passes forwards along the superior curved line of the ilium, between the gluteus medius and minimus to the anterior superior spinous process, where it inosculates with the superficial circumflexa ilii and external circumflex of the femoral. There are frequently two arteries occupying the place of this branch. The Deep inferior branches, two or three in number, cross the gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, where they in- osculate with branches of the external circumflex and ischiatic artery, and send branches through the gluteus minimus to supply the capsule of the hip-joint. Varieties in the branches of the internal iliac.—The most im- portant of the varieties occurring among these branches is the origin of the dorsal artery of the penis from the internal iliac or ischiatic. The artery in this case passes forwards by the side of the prostate gland, and through the upper part of the transverse ligament of the perineum. It would be endangered in the operation of lithotomy. The dorsal artery of the penis is sometimes derived from the ob- turator, and sometimes from one of the external pudic arteries. The artery of the bulb, in its normal course, passes almost trans- versely inwards to the corpus spongiosum. Occasionally, however, it is so oblique in direction as to render its division in lithotomy unavoidable. The obturator artery may be very small or altogether wanting, its place being supplied by a branch from the external iliac or epigastric. The External iliac artery (iliaca externa ; cruralis iliaca), of each side, passes obliquely downwards along the inner border of the psoas muscle, from opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis to the femoral arch, where it becomes the femoral artery. Relations.—It is in relation in front with the spermatic vessels,CIRCUMFLEXA ILII. 374 peritoneum, and a thin layer of fascia, derived from the iliac fascia, which surrounds the artery and vein. At its commencement it is crossed by the ureter, and near its termination by the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve and the circumflexa ilii vein. Externally it lies against the psoas muscle, from which it is sepa- rated by the iliac fascia ; and 'posteriorly it is in relation with the external iliac vein, which, at the femoral arch, becomes placed to its inner side. The artery is surrounded by lymphatic vessels and several glands. Branches.—Besides several small twigs which supply the lym- phatic glands and psoas muscle, the external iliac gives off two branches, the Epigastric, Circumflexa ilii. The Epigastric artery (epigastrica) arises from the front of the external iliac near Poupart's ligament; and passing inwards between the peritoneum and transversalis fascia, ascends obliquely to the sheath of the rectus. It enters that sheath near its lower third, passes upwards behind the rectus muscle, to which it is distributed, and, in the substance of that muscle, inosculates, near the ensiform cartilage, with the termination (superior epigastric) of the internal mammary artery. It lies internally to the internal abdominal ring and immediately above the femoral ring, and is crossed near its origin by the vas deferens in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The branches of the epigastric artery are, A cremasteric branch (spermatica externa) which accompanies the spermatic cord, and after supplying the cremaster muscle inosculates with the spermatic artery. A pubic branch which is distributed behind the pubes, and sends a small branch of communication downwards to the obturator artery. Muscular branches which pass outwards between the abdominal muscles, and inosculate with the circumflexa ilii, lumbar, and in- ferior intercostal arteries. Superficial branches which pierce the rectus muscle, and are dis- tributed to the integument of the abdomen. The epigastric artery forms a prominence of the peritoneum, which divides the inguinal fossa into an internal and external por- tion ; it is from the former that direct inguinal hernia issues, and from the latter, oblique inguinal hernia. The Circumflexa ilii arises from the outer side of the external iliac, a little below the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely along Poupart's ligament, and curving around the crest of the ilium, inosculates with the ilio-lumbar and inferior lumbar artery. In its course the artery pierces the crural sheath and then lies between the transversalis muscle and fascia; near its termination it pierces the375 FEMORAL ARTERY. transversalis muscle and becomes placed between it and the internal oblique. Opposite the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, it gives off a large ascending branch, which passes, upwards between the internal oblique and transversalis, and divides into numerous branches which supply the abdominal muscles, and inos- culate with the inferior intercostal and the lumbar arteries. Varieties in the branches of the external iliac.—The epigastric artery not unfrequently* gives off the obturator, which descends in contact with the external iliac vein, to the obturator foramen. In this situation the artery would lie to the outer side of the femoral ring, and would not be endangered in the operation of dividing the stricture of femoral hernia. But occasionally the obturator passes along the free margin of Grimbernat's ligament in its course to the obturator foramen, and would completely encircle the neck of the hernial sac, a position in which it could scarcely escape the knife of the operator. In a preparation now before me, the branch of com- munication between the epigastric and obturator artery is much enlarged, and takes this dangerous course. FEMORAL ARTERY. Emerging from beneath Poupart's ligament, the external iliac artery enters the thigh and becomes the femoral. The femoral artery (femoralis ; cruralis) passes down the inner side of the thigh, from Poupart's ligament, at a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, to the opening in the adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle with the inferior third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery. The femoral artery and vein are enclosed in a strong sheath, femoral sheath, which is formed for the greater part of its extent by fibrous and areolar tissue, and by a process of fascia sent inwards from the fascia lata. Near Poupart's ligament this sheath is much larger (infundibuliforrn) than the vessels it contains, and is con- tinuous with the transversalis and iliac fascia. If the sheath be opened at this point, the artery will be seen in contact with the outer wall of the sheath. The vein lies next the artery, being separated from it by a fibrous septum, and between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath, and divided from the vein by another thin fibrous septum, is a triangular interval (femoral or crural canal), into which the sac is protruded in femoral hernia. This space is occupied in the normal state of the parts by loose cellular tissue, and by lymphatic vessels which pierce the inner wall of the * The proportion in which high division of the obturator artery from the epigastric occurs, is stated to be one in three. In two hundred and fifty sub- jects examined by Cloquet with a view to ascertain how frequently the high division took place, he found the obturator arising from the epigastric on both sides one hundred and fifty times : on one side, twenty-eight times, and six times it arose from the femoral artery.FEMORAL ARTERY. 376 slieatli to make their way to a gland, crural ring. situated in the femoral or Relations. — The upper. third of the femoral artery- is superficial, being Covered only by the integument,-in- guinal glands, and superfi- cial and deep fascia.

To its inner side it is in relation at its upper part with the femoral vein, and lower down • with the pectineus, adductor longus, and sartorius. The (. immediate relations of the artery are, the femoral vein, long saphenous nerve, and muscular nerve to the vastus internus. The vein at Poupart's ligament lies to the inner side of the artery ; but lower down gets behind it, and inclines to its outer side. The muscular nerve lies to the outer side, and somewhat upon the sheath for the lower two-thirds of its extent; and the long saphenous nerve is situated within the sheath, and in front of the artery for the same extent.

Muscular, Anastomotica magna. The Superficial circumflexa ilii artery (circumflexa ilii.externa) arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, and passes obliquely outwards towards the crest of the ilium, where it pierces the fascia lata. It supplies the integument of the groin, superficial fascia, and inguinal glands. The Superficial epigastric (epigastrica superficial is) arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, pierces the fascia lata, and ascends obliquely towards the umbilicus between the two layers of the superficial fascia. It distributes branches to the inguinal glands and integument, and inosculates with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary artery. The Superior external pudic (pudenda externa, superior) arises378 PROFUNDA FEMORIS ARTERY. near the superficial epigastriG artery ; it pierces the fascia lata at the saphenous opening, and passes transversely inwards, crossing the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument of the penis and scrotum (rami scrotales anteriores) in the male, and to the labia (rami labiales anteriores) in the female. The Inferior external pudic(pudenda externa, inferior) arises from the femoral a little below, and sometimes in common with, the preceding ; it crosses the femoral vein immediately below the termination of the internal saphenous vein, and resting -on the pectineus muscle reaches the inner border of the thigh, where it pierces the fascia lata, and is distributed to the integument of the external organs of generation and perineum. Both external pudics inosculate with the internal pudic artery. The Profunda femoris (femoralis profunda) arises from the outer and posterior side of the femoral artery about one inch'and a half below Poupart's ligament; it passes downwards and backwards and a little outwards, behind the adductor longus muscle, pierces the adductor magnus, and is distributed to the flexor muscles on the posterior part of the thigh.

To its outer side the tendinous insertion of the vastus internus muscle intervenes between it and the femur ; on its inner side it is in relation with the pectineus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus ; and in front it is separated from the femoral artery, above by the profunda and femoral vein, and below by the adductor longus muscle. Branches.—The branches of the profunda artery are, the external circumflex, internal circumflex, and three perforating arteries.PROFUNDA FEMOEIS ARTERY. 379 The External circumflex artery (circumflexa femoris externa) passes outwards beneath the sartorius and rectus and in front of the crureus muscle, crossing between the divisions of the crural nerve, and divides into three sets of branches ; ascending, which pass upwards beneath the sartorius, rectus, and tensor vaginae femoris, and inosculate with the terminal branches of the gluteal artery ; descending, which pass downwards beneath the rectus muscle to inosculate with the superior articular arteries of the popliteal; and middle, which continue the original course of the artery around the thigh, pierce the vastus externus, and anastomose with branches of the ischiatic, internal circumflex, and superior perforating artery. • It supplies the muscles of the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The Internal circumflex artery (circumflexa femoris interna) winds around the inner side of the neck of the femur, passing be- tween the pectineus and psoas, and over the upper border of the adductor brevis to the tendon of the obturator externus, which it accompanies to the space between the quadratus femoris and upper border of the adductor magnus. While on the obturator externus it gives off a branch which is distributed to that muscle, the ad- ductor brevis, and gracilis, and anastomoses with the obturator artery. It next gives off an articular branch, which enters the hip-joint through the notch in the acetabulum ; and terminates in several branches which inosculate with the ischiatic, external cir- cumflex, and superior perforating artery. The Superior perforating artery passes backwards near the lower border of the pectineus, pierces the adductor brevis and magnus near the femur, and is distributed to the posterior muscles of the thigh ; inosculating with the circumflex, ischiatic, and middle perforating artery. The Middle perforating artery pierces the tendons of the ad- ductor brevis and magnus, and is distributed like the superior ; inosculating with the superior and inferior perforating. From this branch is given off the nutritious artery of the femur. The Inferior perforating artery is given off below the adductor brevis, and pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus, supplying it and the flexor muscles, and inosculating with the middle perforat- ing artery above, and the articular branches of the popliteal below. It is through the medium of the branches of the profunda which inosculate above with branches of the internal iliac, and below with those of the popliteal artery, that the collateral circulation is main- tained in the limb after ligature of the femoral artery. The Muscular branches are given off by the femoral artery throughout the whole of its course. They supply the muscles in immediate proximity with the artery, particularly those of the an- terior aspect of the thigh. One of these branches, larger than the rest, arises from the femoral immediately below the origin of the profunda, and passing outwards between the sartorius and rectus,POPLITEAL ARTEEY. 380 divides into branches, which are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thigh. This may be named the superior muscular artery. The Anastomotic^ magna (articularis genu superficialis) arises from the femoral near its termination at the opening in the adductor magnus, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch accompanies the internal saphenous nerve to the knee, and piercing the fascia lata is distributed to the integument. The deep branch passes onwards through the substance of the vastus internus muscle, resting on the tendon of the adductor magnus, to the knee ; where it inosculates with the internal arti- cular branches of the popliteal, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. It also sends a branch through the vastus internus, which supplies the synovial membrane of the joint, and inosculates with the superior external articular artery and external circumflex. The popliteal artery (poplitea. Fig. 164) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial artery. In structure the popliteal artery is remarkable for the thickness of its walls. POPLITEAL ARTERY. Plan of the Relations of the Popliteal Artery. Superficially.

By its inner side it is in relation with the semi- membranosus, internal condyle of the femur, and inner head of the gastrocnemius ; and by its outer side with the biceps, external condyle of the femur, outer head of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus. Branches.—The branches of the popliteal artery are, the Superior external articular, Inferior external articular, Superior internal articular, Inferior internal articular,. Azygos articular, Sural. The Superior articular arteries (articulares genu superiores), external and internal, wind around the femur, immediately above the condyles, to the front of the knee-joint, anastomosing with each other, with the external circumflex, anastomotica magna, inferior articular, and recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the tendon of the biceps, and the internal through an arched opening beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus. They supply the knee-joint and lower part of the femur, and give branches to the vasti muscles. The Azygos articular artery (articularis genu media) pierces the posterior ligament of the joint, the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the crucial ligaments and synovial membrane. There are, frequently, several posterior articular arteries. The Inferior articular arteries (articulares genu inferiores) wind around the head of the tibia immediately below the joint, and anastomose with each other, the superior articular arteries, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the two external lateral ligaments of the joint, the internal be- neath the internal lateral ligament. They supply the knee-joint and the heads of the tibia and fibula. The Sural arteries (surales; sura, the calf) are two muscular branches of large size, distributed to the two heads of the gastro- cnemius muscle. Other muscular branches are given off from the upper part of the popliteal artery to supply the hamstring muscles. ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The anterior tibial artery (tibialis antica) passes forwards be- tween the two heads of the tibialis posticus muscle, and through the opening in the upper part of the interosseous membrane, to the anterior tibial region. It then runs down the anterior aspect of the leg to the ankle-joint, where it becomes the dorsalis pedis.382 ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. Relations.—In its course it rests on the interosseous membrane (to which it is connected by a little tendinous arch which is thrown across it), the lower part of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the joint. In its upper third ft is situated between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digftorum, lower down between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis ; and just before it reaches the ankle it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and becomes placed between that tendon and the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. Its immediate relations are the venae comites and anterior tibial nerve ; the latter lies at first to its outer side, at about the middle of the leg it is placed superficially to the artery, and at the ankle is again at its outer side.

The Muscular branches are numerous, they supply the muscles of the anterior tibial region.

The Dorsalis pedis artery is continued forward along the tibial side of the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe, where it gives off a branch, dorsalis hal- lucis ; it then dips between the two heads of the first dorsal interos- seous muscle into the sole of the foot and becomes continuous with the deep plantar arch. Relations.—The dorsalis pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis ; at its fibular side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near its ter- mination it is crossed by the inner tendon-of the extensor brevis digi- torum. It is accompanied by vense comites, and has the continuation of the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. * Anterior aspect of the leg and foot, showing the anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery; the tibialis anticus has been removed. 1.

Branches.—The branches of this artery are, the Tarsea, Dorsalis hallucis, Metatarsea, Magna pollicis. The Tarsea (externa) arches transversely across the tarsus, beneath the extensor brevis digitorum muscle, and supplies the articulations of the tarsal bones and outer side of the foot: it anas- tomoses with the external malleolar, peroneal arteries, and external plantar. The Metatarsea forms an arch (arcus tarseus vel dorsalis' pedis) across the base of the metatarsal bones, and supplies the outer side of the foot; anastomosing with the tarsea and external plantar artery. From its convex side the metatarsea gives off three branches, interossece, which pass forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles, and divide into branches (dorsal collateral) for the supply of the sides of the toes between which they are placed. At their commencement these interosseous branches receive the posterior perforating arteries from the plantar arch, and opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones are joined by the anterior perforating branches from the digital arteries. The interosseous artery of the fourth interosseous space, in addition to the two dorsal collateral branches into which it bifurcates, sends a third branch to the outer side of the little toe. The Dorsalis hallucis (interossea dorsalis prima) runs forward upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, one of which passes inwards be- neath the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and is distributed to the inner border of the great toe, while the other bifurcates into two dorsal collateral digital branches for the adjacent sides of the great and second toe. The Arteria magna pollicis arises from the dorsalis pedis, while in the metatarsal space and just before its inosculation with the external plantar artery. It sends a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe on its plantar aspect, and bifurcates tc supply the plantar collateral digital branches of the great and second toe.385 POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The posterior tibial artery (tibialis postica) passes obliquely down- wards along the tibial side of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, where it divides into the internal and external plantar artery. Relations.—In its course it lies first on the tibialis posticus, next on the flexor longus digitorum, then on the tibia ; it is covered in by the intermuscular fascia which separates it above from the soleus, below from the deep fascia and integument. It is accom- panied by vense comites, and by the f '^rior tibial nerve, which lies to its inner side at first, and to its outer side for the rest of its course.

Branches.—The branches of the posterior tibial artery are, the Peroneal, Internal calcanean, Nutritious, Internal plantar, Muscular, External plantar. The Peroneal artery (peronsea; fibularis) is given off from the posterior tibial at about two inches below the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; it is nearly as large as the anterior tibial artery, and -passes obliquely outwards to the fibula. It then runs down- wards along the inner border of the fibula to its lower third, where it divides into the anterior and posterior peroneal. Relations.—The peroneal artery rests on the tibialis posticus muscle, and is covered in by the soleus, intermuscular fascia, and flexor longus pollicis, having the fibula to its outer side. Branches.—The branches of the peroneal artery are, muscular to the soleus and neighbouring muscles : nutrient to the fibula ; and vo terminal branches anterior and posterior peroneal. The Anterior peroneal artery (perona3a antica vel perforans) pierces the interosseous membrane at the lower third of the leg, c o386 PERONEAL ARTERY. and is distributed on the front of the outer malleolus, anastomosing with the external malleolar and tarsal artery. Fig. 164 The Posterior peroneal continues onwards along the posterior aspect of the outer malleolus to the side of the os calcis, to which and to the muscles arising from it, it distri- butes external calcanean branches. It anastomoses with the anterior peroneal, tarsal, external plantar, and posterior tibial artery; with the latter by means of a small transverse branch (ramus anasto- moticus transversus). The Nutritious artery (nutritia tibise) of the tibia arises from the . trunk of the posterior, tibial, fre- quently above ,the origin of the peroneal, and proceeds to the nutri- tious canal, which it traverses ob- liquely from below upwards. The Muscular tranches of the posterior tibial artery are distrir buted to the soleus and deep mus- cles of the posterior aspect of the leg. One of these branches is deserving of notice, a recurrent branch, which arises from the pos- terior tibial above the origin of the peroneal artery, pierces the soleus, * Posterior view of the leg, showing the popliteal and posterior tibial artery. 1.

The Internal calcanean branches, three or four in number, pro- ceed from the posterior tibial artery immediately before its division; they are distributed to the integument, to the inner side of the os calcis, and^to the muscles which arise from its inner tuberosity ; and anastomose with the external calcanean branches of the poste- rior peroneal, and with all the neighbouring arteries, forming around the heel a network of inosculations, rete calcaneum. PLANTAR ARTERIES. The Internal plantar artery (plantaris interna) proceeds from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial at the inner malleolus, and passes along the inner border of the foot beneath the abductor pol- Fi3-165-* licis, supplying the'inner border of the foot and great toe. The External plantar artery (plantaris externa), much larger than the internal, passes obliquely outwards between the first and second layer of the plantar muscles £o the fourth metatarsal space. It then turns transversely inwards be- tween the second and third layer, to the first metatarsal space, where it inosculates with the dorsalis pedis. The transverse portion of the artery describes a slight curve, having the convexity forwards; this is the plantar arch (arcus plantaris).

The Digital branches (interossese plantares) are four in number : the first is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; the three others pass forward to the cleft between the toes, and divide into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the three external toes, and the outer side of the second. At the bifurcation of the toes, a small branch is sent upwards from each digital artery, to inosculate with the interosseous branches of the metatarsea ; these are the anterior perforating arteries. The Posterior perforating are three small branches which pass upwards between the heads of the three external dorsal interossei muscles, to inosculate with the arch formed by the metatarsea artery. Varieties in the Arteries of the Lower Extremity.—The femoral artery occasionally divides at Poupart's ligament into two branches, and sometimes into three ; the former is an instance of the high division of the profunda artery ; and in a case of the latter kind which occurred during my dissections, the branches were, the pro- funda, superficial femoral, and internal circumflex. Dr. Jones Quain, in his "Elements of Anatomy," records an instance of high division of the femoral artery, in which the two vessels became again united in the popliteal region. The point of origin of the profunda artery varies considerably in different subjects, being sometimes nearer to and sometimes farther from Poupart's ligament, but more frequently the former. The branches of the popliteal artery are very liable to variety in size ; and in all these cases the compensating principle, so constant in the vascular system, is manifested. When the anterior tibial is of small size, the peroneal is large; and in place of dividing into two terminal branches at the lower third of the leg, descends to the lower part of the inter- osseous membrane, and emerges upon the front of the ankle, to sup- ply the dorsum of the foot; or the posterior tibial and plantar ar- teries are large, and the external plantar is continued between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, to be distributed to the dorsal surface of the foot. Sometimes the posterior tibial artery is small and thread-like; and the peroneal, after descending to the ankle, curves inwards to the inner malleolus, and divides into the two plantar arteries. If, in this case, the posterior tibial be suffi- ciently large to reach the ankle, it inosculates with the peroneal previously to the division of the latter. The internal plantar artery sometimes takes the distribution of the external plantar, which is short and diminutive, and the latter not unfrequently replaces a deficient dorsalis pedis. The varieties of arteries are interesting in the practical application of a knowledge of their principal forms to surgical operations ; in their transcendental anatomy, as illustrating the normal type of dis- tribution in animals; or, in many cases, as diverticula permittedPULMONARY ARTERY. 389 by Nature, to teach her observers two important principles -.—first, in respect to herself, that, however in her means she may indulge in change, the end is never overlooked, and a limb is as surely sup- plied by a leash of arteries, various in their course, as by those which we are pleased to consider normal in distribution; and secondly, with regard to us, that we should be keenly alive to what- ever is passing beneath our observation, and ready in the most serious operation to deviate from our course, and avoid—or give eyes to our knife, that it may see—the concealed dangers which it is our pride to be able to contend with and vanquish. PULMONARY ARTERY. The pulmonary artery (arteria pulmonolis) arises from the left side of the base of the right ventricle in front of the origin of the aorta, and ascends obliquely for the space of two inches to the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into the right and left pulmonary artery. In its course upwards and backwards it inclines to the left side, crossing the commencement of the aorta, and is connected by its left branch to the under surface of the arch by a thick and impervious cord (ligamentum arteriosum ; chorda ductus arteriosi), the remains of the ductus arteriosus of the foetus. Relations.—It is enclosed for nearly the whole of its extent by the pericardium, and receives the attachment of the fibrous portion of that membrane by its upper portion. Behind, it rests against the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta and left auricle, on either side is the appendix of the corresponding auricle with a coro- nary artery ; and above, the superficial cardiac plexus, and the cord of the ductus arteriosus. The Right pulmonary artery, longer and somewhat larger than the left, passes transversely outwards behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava to the root of the right lung, where it divides into three branches for the three lobes. In its course it lies parallel with and in front of the right bronchus. The Left pulmonary artery, shorter and smaller than the right, crosses the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. The pulmonary arteries divide and subdivide in the structure of the lungs, and terminate in capillary vessels which form a network around the air-passages and cells, and become continuous with the radicles of the pulmonary veins. Relations.—In the root of the right lung, examined from above downwards, the pulmonary artery is situated between the bronchus and pulmonary veins, the former being above, the latter below ; in the root of the left lung the artery is highest, next the bronchus, and then the veins. On both sides from before backwards, the artery is situated between the veins and bronchi, the former being in front, the latter behind.390 CHAPTEE VI. OF THE VEINS. The veins are the vessels which return the blood to the auricles of the heart, after it has been circulated by the arteries through the various tissues of the body. They are much thinner in structure than the arteries, so that when emptied of their blood they become flattened and collapsed. The veins of the systemic circulation convey the dark-coloured and impure or venous blood from the capillary system to the right auricle of the heart, and they are found after death to be more or less distended with that fluid. The veins of the pulmonary circulation resemble the arteries of the systemic circulation in containing during life the pure or arterial blood, which they transmit from the capillaries of the lungs to the left auricle. The veins commence by minute radicles in the capillaries which are everywhere distributed through the textures of the body, and converge to constitute larger and larger branches, till they terminate in the main trunks which convey the venous blood directly to the heart. In diameter they are larger than the arteries, and, like those vessels, their combined arese would constitute a hollow cone, whereof the apex is placed at the heart, and the base at the surface of the body. It follows from this arrangement, that the blood in returning to the heart is passing from a larger into a smaller channel, and therefore that it increases in rapidity during its course. Veins admit of a threefold division into superficial, deep, and sinuses. The Superficial veins return the blood from the integument and superficial structures, and take their course between the layers of the superficial fascia ; they then pierce the deep fascia in the most ^convenient and protected situations, and terminate in the deep veins. They are unaccompanied by arteries, and are the vessels usually selected for venesection. The Deep veins are situated among the deeper structures of the body, and generally in relation with the arteries ; in the limbs they are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and they return the venous blood from the capillaries of the deep tissues. In com- pany with all the smaller, and also with the secondary arteries, as the brachial, radial, and ulnar in the upper, and the tibial and391 STRUCTURE OF THE VEINS. peroneal in the lower extremity, there are two veins, placed one at each side of the artery, and named vence comites. The larger arteries, as the axillary, subclavian, carotid, popliteal, femoral, are accompanied by a single venous trunk ; and certain veins, such as those of the cranium, spinal canal, liver, and larger veins of bones, run apart from arteries. Sinuses differ from veins in their structure; and also in their mode of distribution, being confined to especial organs and situated within their substance. The principal venous sinuses are those of the dura mater, diploe, cancellous structure of bones, and uterus. The communications between veins are more frequent than those of arteries, and they take place between the larger as well as the smaller vessels ; the vena3 comites communicate with each other in their course by means of short transverse branches which pass across from one to the other. These communications are strikingly ex- hibited in the frequent inosculations of the spinal veins, and in the various venous plexuses, as the spermatic plexus, and vesical plexus. The office of these inosculations is very apparent, as tending to obviate the obstructions to which veins are particularly liable from the thinness of their coats, and from their inability to overcome much impediment by the force of their current. Veins, like arteries, are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The External coat is the thickest of the three, increasing by degrees from the smallest to the largest; in the former gradually diminishing until it is lost altogether, and nothing remains but the one coat of the capillary; in the veins of medium size acquiring double the thickness of the middle coat, and in some of the large veins attaining four or five times its thickness. In structure it resembles the external coat of arteries, consisting of areolar tissue interwoven with a network of elastic fibres of the finer and coarser kind. In some of the larger veins, as the inferior vena cava, the trunks of the hepatic veins, and vena portse, there exists besides, a layer of longitudinal smooth muscular fibres, occupying the inner half or two-thirds of the external coat, and, where the middle coat is absent, lying in contact with the internal coat. This muscular stratum is met with in its highest stage of development in that portion of the inferior vena cava which is embedded in the liver, the muscular fibres being intermingled with a fine network of elastic fibres. The Middle or contractile coat is thin but firmer than the external, and composed of areolar tissue, elastic tissue, and smooth muscular fibres ; the two latter being less in quantity than in the corresponding coat of arteries, and the muscular fibres being more abundant in the medium-sized than in the larger veins. The especial character of the middle coat of veins is, however, the presence of longitudinal as well as transverse fibres; the longitudinal fibres consisting of closely-reticulated elastic tissue, occurring inSTRUCTURE OF THE VEINS. 392 layers and alternating with the circular layers composed of smooth muscular fibres intermingled with areolar tissue and fine elastic fibres. The number of layers constituting the middle coat varies, according to the size and thickness of the vessel, from five to ten ; and they are so disposed that the inner and outer layers are muscular, while the longitudinal elastic layers are more abundant towards the inner than the outer portion of the coat, and, although stratified, communicate with each other at different points so as to form one continuous whole. In the veins of the lower extremity the middle coat is thicker than elsewhere, and in certair of the veins of the lower limb, as the popliteal, profunda, and saphense, there exists an additional layer on the inner aspect of the middle coat, a layer composed of areolar tissue intermingled with fine elastic fibres and having a longitudinal fibrillation ; the longitudinal lamina of the middle coat. In tracing the veins downwards to those of the smallest size, the layers of areolar tissue mingled with fine elastic fibres are the first to disappear ; then the muscular element is re- duced to a single layer, while its cells are separated and scanty and finally cease; the elastic element consisting of a network of fine elastic fibres is continued further and becomes continuous with the coat of the capillaries. In that portion of the inferior cava which is embedded in the liver and in the larger hepatic veins, the middle coat is wanting and the external and internal coat are in contact. The Internal coat, stronger than that of arteries, is composed of an epithelium and an elastic membrane, between which is situated a striated nuclear lamella. The epithelium consists of nucleated cells, which are elongated in veins of large and medium size ; elliptic and almost round in the smallest veins, and cease altogether in the transitional veins. The elastic membrane is not homogeneous and fenestrated as in arteries, but composed of a closely areolated longi- tudinal network of coarse and fine elastic fibres. In the smallest veins this membrane is lost and its place supplied by a layer of homogeneous or sub-fibrous areolar tissue. The veins which open into the heart, have an external annular layer of muscular fibres similar to those of the heart and presenting the same anastomosing structure. They are met with on the superior and inferior vena cava and around the pulmonary veins. Smooth muscular fibres are found in the veins of the gravid uterus in great abundance and highly developed, in all the three coats ; while in other veins the muscular element is altogether absent, as in the' maternal portion of the placenta; the greater part of the veins of the cerebral substance and pia mater; the sinuses of the dura mater and of the bones ; the veins of the corpora cavernosa ; probably those of the spleen ; and the veins of the retina. These veins are simply composed of condensed areolar tissue more or less completely developed and lined by epithelium ; the sinuses of the dura mater have besides some fine elastic fibres.VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 393 The Valves of veins are composed of a thin stratum of nucleated areolar tissue mingled with fine elastic fibres, and coated on the two surfaces with an epithelium of less elongated cells. The segments or flaps of the valves of veins are semilunar in form, and arranged in pairs, one upon either side of the vessel ; in some instances there is but a single flap, which has a spiral direction, and occasionally there are three. The free border of the valvular flaps is concave, and directed forwards, so that while the current of blood is per- mitted to flow freely towards the heart, the valves are distended, and the current intercepted, if the stream become retrograde in its course. On the cardiac side of each valve the vein is expanded into two pouches (sinuses), corresponding with the flaps of the valves, which give to the distended or injected vein a knotted appearance. The valves are most numerous in the veins of the extremities, par- ticularly in the deeper veins, and they are generally absent in the very small veins, and in the veins of the viscera, as in the portal and cerebral veins ; they are also absent in the large trunks, as in the venae cava?, venaa azygos, innominate, and iliac veins. Sinuses are venous channels, excavated in the structure of an organ, and lined by the internal coat of the veins ; of this structure are the sinuses of the dura mater, whose external covering is the fibrous tissue of the membrane. The external investment of the sinuses of the uterus is the tissue of that organ ; and that of the bones, the lining membrane of the cells and canals. Veins, like arteries, are supplied with nutritious vessels, the vasa vasorum ; their nervous filaments, few in number and of small size, are derived from the sympathetic and spinal system ; they have been found only on the larger veins ; as, the vense cavse, iliacs, crural, jugular, vertebral, and sinuses of the dura mater. I shall describe the veins according to the primary division of the body ; taking first, those of the head and neck ; next, those of the upper extremity; then, those of the lower extremity ; and lastly, the veins of the trunk. The veins of the head and neck may be arranged into three groups, namely, veins of the exterior of the head, veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium, veins of the neck. The veins of the exterior of the head are, the The Facial vein (facialis anterior) commences on the anterior part of the head in a venous plexus, formed by the communications of the branches of the temporal, and descends along the middle line VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Facial, Internal maxillary, Temporal, Temporo-maxillary, Posterior auricular, Occipital.VEINS OP THE HEAD AND NECK. 394 of the forehead, under the name of frontal vein, to the root of the nose, where it is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a communicating trunk, the nasal arch. There are usually two frontal veins, which communicate by a transverse inosculation ; but sometimes the vein is single and bifurcates at the root of the nose, into the two angular veins. From the nasal arch the frontal is continued downwards by the side of the root of the nose, and near the angle of the eye, under the name of angular vein ; it then passes beneath the zygomatic muscles, becomes the facial vein, and descends along the anterior border of the masseter muscle, crossing the body of the lower jaw by the side of the facial artery, to the submaxillary gland, and from thence to the internal jugular vein, in which it terminates. The branches which the facial vein receives in its course are, the supra-orbital, which joins the frontal vein ; the dorsal veins of the nose, which terminate in the nasal arch ; the ophthalmic, which communicates with the angular vein; the palpebral and nasal, which open into the angular vein ; a considerable trunk, the deep facial (maxillaris interna anterior), which returns the blood from the spheno-maxillary fossa, from the infraorbital, palatine, vidian, and spheno-palatine veins, and joins the facial beneath the zygo- matic process of the superior maxillary bone ; and the veins corre- sponding with the branches of the facial artery. The Internal maxillary vein receives the veins from the zygo- matic and pterygoid fossa; these are so numerous and communi- cate so freely as to constitute a pterygoid plexus. Passing back- wards behind the neck of the lower jaw, the internal maxillary joins the temporal vein. The Temporal vein commences on the vertex of the head by a plexiform network, which is continuous with the frontal, opposite temporal, auricular, and occipital vein. The ramifications of this plexus form an anterior and posterior branch which unite imme- diately above the zygoma ; the trunk is here joined by another large vein, the middle temporal, which collects the blood from the temporal muscle and outer segment of the orbit, and pierces the temporal fascia near the root of the zygoma. The temporal vein then descends in the substance of the parotid gland to the angle of the lower jaw, where it divides into two trunks, one of which, mounting upon the sterno-mastoideus muscle, constitutes the ex- ternal jugular vein; while the other, uniting with the facial vein, becomes the temporo-maxillary vein. The temporal vein receives the anterior auricular, masseteric, transverse facial, and parotid veins. The Temporo-maxillary vein, a short trunk formed by the union of the temporo-maxillary trunk and facial vein, sends a branch to the anterior jugular, and terminates in the internal jugular vein. It receives the lingual, laryngeal, and superior thyroid vein. The Posterior auricular vein communicates with the plexus of395 CEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. the vertex of the head, and descends behind the ear to join the external jugular vein near its origin. It receives in its course the veins of the external ear and the siylo-mastoid vein. The Occipital vein commencing posteriorly in the plexus of the vertex of the head, follows the direction of the occipital artery, and passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of the neck, terminates in the external or internal jugular vein. This vein communicates with the lateral sinus by means of a large branch which passes through the mastoid foramen, the mastoid vein. VEINS OP THE DIPLOE. The diploe' of the bones of the head is furnished in the adult with irregular sinuses (venos diploeticoz), which are formed by a continu- ation of the internal coat of the veins into the osseous canals in which they are lodged. At the middle period of life these sinuses are confined to separate bones ; but in old age, after the ossification of the sutures, they may be traced from one bone to the next. They receive their blood from the capillaries supplying the cellular structure of the diploe, and terminate externally in the veins of the pericranium, internally, in the veins and sinuses of the dura mater ; they are separated from the bony walls of the canals by a thin layer of medulla. Breschet describes four of these diploetic veins, namely, frontalis, temporalis anterior, temporalis posterior, and occipitalis. The diploetica frontalis, the smallest of the four, escapes from the frontal bone at the supraorbital notch, and opens into the supra- orbital vein. The temporalis anterior also collects the blood from the frontal bone, and terminates either in the deep temporal veins or in the cavernous sinus. The temporalis posterior commences in the parietal bone, and opens into the lateral sinus, sometimes sending a branch outwards to the veins of the scalp. The occipi- talis, the largest of the four, originates in the occipital bone, and terminates in the occipital sinus, or externally in the occipital vein. CEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. The cerebral veins are remarkable for the absence of valves, and for the extreme tenuity of their coats. They may be arranged into the superficial, and deep or ventricular veins. The Superficial cerebral veins are situated on the surface of the hemispheres lying in the grooves formed by the convexities of the convolutions. They are named from the position which they may chance to occupy on the surface of the brain, either superior or in- ferior, internal or external, anterior or posterior. The Superior cerebral veins, seven or eight in number at each side, pass obliquely forwards, and terminate in the superior longi- tudinal sinus, in the opposite direction to the course of the streamSINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 396 of blood iii the sinus. In the infant the direction of these veins is nearly transverse. The Deep or Ventricular veins commence within the lateral ven- tricles by the veins of the corpora striata and those of the choroid plexus, which unite to form the two venae Galeni. The Vence Galeni pass backwards in the structure of the velum interpositum ; and escaping through the fissure of Bichat, terminate in the straight sinus. The Cerebellar veins are disposed, like those of the cerebrum, on the surface of the lobes of the cerebellum ; they are situated, some on the superior, some on the inferior surface, while others occupy the borders of the organ. They terminate in the lateral and petrosal sinuses. SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels formed by the splitting of the layers of that membrane, and lined on their Fig. 168.* inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They may be divided into two groups—those situated at the upper * Sinuses of the upper and back part of the skull. 1. Superior longitudinal sinus. 2, 2.

The former are, the Superior longitudinal sinus, Occipital sinuses, Inferior longitudinal sinus, Lateral sinuses. Straight sinus, The Superior longitudinal sinus is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen caecum in the frontal, to the inner tuberosity of tbe occipital bone, where it divides into the two lateral sinuses. It is triangular in form, small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives the superior cerebral veins which open into it obliquely, numerous small veins from the diploe, and near the posterior extremity of tbe sagittal suture the parietal veins, from the pericranium and scalp. Examined in its interior, it presents numerous transverse fibrous bands (trabecule) the chordce Willisii, which are stretched across its inferior angle ; and some small white granular masses, the glandulce Pacchioni; the oblique openings of the cerebral veins, with their valve-like margin, are also seen on the walls of the sinus. The termination of the superior longitudinal sinus in the two lateral sinuses forms a considerable dilatation, into which the straight sinus opens from the front, and the occipital sinuses from below. This dilatation is named the torcular Herophili,* and is the point of communication of six sinuses, the superior longitudinal, two lateral, two occipital, and the straight. The Inferior longitudinal sinus is situated in the free margin of the falx cerebri; it is cylindrical in form, and extends from near the crista galli to the anterior border of the tentorium, where it termi- nates in the straight sinus. It receives in its course several veins from the falx and sometimes one or two from the internal surface of the hemispheres. The Straight or fourth sinus (sinus tentorii) is the sinus of the tentorium ; it is situated at the line of union of the falx with the tentorium ; is prismoid in form, and extends across the tentorium, from the termination of the inferior longitudinal sinus to the toixmlar Herophili. It receives the vena? Galeni, the cerebral veins from the inferior part of the posterior lobes, and the superior cerebellar veins. The Occipital sinuses (occipitales posteriores) are two canals of small size, situated in the attached border of the falx cerebelli; they commence by several small veins around the foramen magnum, and terminate by separate openings in the torcular Herophili. Not unfrequently they communicate with the termination of the lateral sinuses. * Torcular (a press), from a supposition entertained by the older anatomists that the columns of blood, coming in different directions, compressed each other at this point.CAVEKNOUS SINUSES. 398 The Lateral sinuses (sinus transversi, vel laterales), commencing at the torcular Herophili, pass horizontally outwards, in the at- tached margin of the tentorium, and then curve downwards and inwards along the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at each side, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they termi- nate in the internal jugular veins. Each sinus rests in its course on the transverse groove of the occipital bone, posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid portion of the temporal, and again on the occipital bone. They receive the cerebral veins from the in- ferior surface of the posterior lobes, the inferior cerebellar veins, superior petrosal sinuses, mastoid and posterior condyloid vein. These sinuses are often unequal in size, the right being larger than the left. The sinuses of the base of the skull are, the Cavernous, Superior petrosal, Inferior petrosal, Transverse. Circular, The Cavernous sinuses are named from pre- senting a structure si- milar to that of the corpus cavernosum pe- nis. They are situated at each side of the sella turcica, receiving, ante- riorly, the ophthalmic veins through the sphe- noidal fissures, and ter- minating posteriorly in the inferior petrosal sinuses. In the caver- nous sinus is the inter- nal carotid artery, seve- ral filaments of the ca- rotid plexus, the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. The ar- tery is separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the lining membrane of * Sinuses of the base of the skull. 1. Ophthalmic veins. 2. Cavernous sinus of one side. 3.

Besides the ophthalmic vein the cavernous sinus receives the cerebral veins of the under part of the anterior lobe, a vein from the posterior border of the orbit (sinus spheno-parietalis) and the vein of the middle fossa of the cranium. The cavernous sinuses communicate by means of the ophthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the cavern- ous sinuses backwards along the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone at each side of the base of the skull, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the commencement of the internal jugular veins. The Circular sinus (sinus of Ridley ; ellipticus) is situated in the sella turcica, surrounding the pituitary gland, and communicating on each side with the cavernous sinus. The posterior segment is larger than the anterior. The Superior petrosal sinuses pass obliquely backwards along the attached border of the tentorium, on the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and establish a communica- tion between the cavernous and lateral sinus at each side. They receive one or two cerebral veins from the inferior part of the middle lobes, and a cerebellar vein from the anterior border of the cere- bellum. Near the extremity of the petrous bone these sinuses cross the oval aperture which transmits the fifth nerve. The Transverse sinus (basilaris; occipitalis anterior) passes transversely across the basilar process of the occipital bone, forming a communication between the two inferior petrosal sinuses. Some- times there are two sinuses in this situation, or, more properly, a plexus. The veins of the neck which return the blood from the head are, The External jugular vein, the continuation of the superficial division of the temporo-maxillary, augmented by the junction of the posterior auricular, and sometimes of the occipital, commences at the lower border of the parotid gland, in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It descends the neck in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the lower jaw to the middle of the clavicle, crosses the sterno-mastoid, and terminates near the posterior and inferior attachment of that muscle, in the subclavian vein. In its course downwards, it lies on the anterior lamella of the deep cervical fascia, which separates it from the sterno-mastoid muscle, and is covered in by the platysma myoides and superficial fascia ; at the root of the neck it pierces the deep cervical fascia. It is accoru- VEINS OP THE NEtJK. External jugular, Anterior jugular, Internal jugular, Vertebral.400 JUGULAR VEINS. panied, for the upper half of its course, by the auricularis magnus nerve. The branches which it receives are the occipital cutaneous and posterior cervical cutaneous, and, near its termination, the supra-scapular and posterior scapular. The external jugular vein is variable in size, and occasionally- replaced by two veins. The Anterior jugular vein commences on the os hyoides by several small veins and by a branch from the temporo-maxillary, and passes downwards along the midline of the neck to the sternum ; it then turns outwards behind the lower part of the sterno-mastoi- deus and opens into the subclavian vein, near the termination of the external jugular. The two veins communicate with each other, and with the external and internal jugular vein. The Internal jugular vein, formed by the convergence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinus, commences at the foramen lace- rum posterius on each side of the base of the skull, by a dilatation (bulbus venae jugularis), and descends the side of the neck, lying, in the first instance, to the outer side of the internal carotid, then on the outer side of the common carotid artery to the root of the neck, where it unites with the subclavian, and constitutes the vena innominata. At its commencement, the internal jugular vein is posterior and external to the internal carotid artery and eighth pair of nerves, the hypoglossal nerve being behind it; lower down, the vein and artery are on the same plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerve passing forwards between them, the pneumo- gastric being between and behind in the same sheath, and the nervus accessorius crossing obliquely behind or before the vein at its upper part. The branches which the internal jugular receives in its course are, pharyngeal, occipital, deep division of the temporo-maxillary, and middle thyroid'. The Vertebral vein descends by the side of the vertebral artery, in the canal formed by the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebra?, and at the root of the neck opens into the subclavian vein close to its termination. In the lower part of the vertebral canal it frequently divides into two branches, one of which advances forwards, while the other passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, before open- ing into the subclavian vein. . The branches which it receives in its course are the posterior condyloid vein, muscular veins, cervical meningo-racliidian veins, and near its termination, the superficial and deep cervical veins. The Inferior thyroid veins, two, and frequently more in number, are situated one on each side of the trachea, and receive the venous blood from the thyroid gland. They communicate with each other, and with the middle and superior thyroid veins, and form a plexus on the front of the trachea. The right vein terminates in the rightVEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 401 vena innominata, just at its union with the superior cava; the left in the left vena innominata. VEINS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The veins of the upper extremity are deep and superficial. The deep veins accompany tbe branches and trunks of the arteries, and constitute their vence comites. The vense comites of the radial and ulnar artery are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and terminate at the bend of the elbow in the brachial veins. The brachial venae comites are situated one at each side of the artery, and open into the axillary vein ; the axillary becomes the subcla- vian, and the subclavian unites with the internal jugular to form the vena innominata. The Superficial veins of the arm are, the Anterior ulnar vein, Cephalic vein, Posterior ulnar vein, Median vein, Basilic vein, Median basilic, Radial vein, Median cephalic. The Anterior ulnar rem collects the venous blood from the inner and palmar border of the hand and ascends along the anterior as- pect of the inner side of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it receives the median basilic, and becomes the basilic vein. The Posterior ulnar vein commences on the dorsum of the hand by the ulnar termination of the venous arch which receives the digital veins from the fingers, and, after being joined by a large vein, the vena salvatella, from the little finger, ascends along the posterior aspect of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it turns forward and terminates in the anterior ulnar vein. The Basilic vein (/3acn\i/eds, royal, or principal) ascends from the common ulnar vein formed by the two preceding, along the inner side of the upper arm, and near its middle pierces the fascia ; it then passes upwards to the axilla, and becomes the axillary vein. The Radial vein commences on the dorsum of the hand, by the radial termination of the venous arch, which receives the veins of the fingers. This origin is increased by the junction of some small veins from the thumb. The radial vein ascends the dorsal side of the forearm to a little below its middle, then lies on its anterior aspect to the bend of the elbow, where it receives the median cephalic, and becomes the cephalic vein. The Cephalic vein (K€<pa\i], the head) ascends along the outer side of the upper arm to its superior third ; it then enters the groove between the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, where it is in relation with the descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery, and terminates beneath the clavicle in the axillary vein. A large communicating branch sometimes crosses the clavicle between D DMEDIAN CEPHALIC AND BASILIC VEINS. 402 Fig. 168 the external jugular and this vein, which gives it the appearance of being derived directly from the head—hence its appellation. The Median vein is intermediate in position between the anterior ulnar and radial vein; it begins at the wrist by the junction of branches from the palm of the hand, and collects the blood from the anterior aspect of the forearm, communicat- ing with the two preceding. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch from the deep veins, and divides into two branches, the me- dian cephalic and median basilic. The Median cephalic vein, longer and somewhat smaller than the me- dian basilic, passes obliquely out- wards, in the groove between the biceps and supinator longus, to unite with the radial and form the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cutaneous nerve pass behind it. The Median basilic vein, larger than the median cephalic, passes ob- liquely inwards, in the groove , be- tween the biceps and pronator radii teres, and unites with the common trunk of the ulnar veins to form the basilic vein. This vein is crossed by one or two filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve, and overlies the brachial artery from which it is se- parated by the aponeurotic slip given off from the tendon of the biceps.

Above the pectoralis minor it receives the cephalic vein. Subclavian vein.—The subclavian vein crosses the first rib and beneath the clavicle, and unites with the internal jugular vein to form the vena innominata. It lies at first in front of the sub- clavian artery, and then in front of the scalenus anticus, which separates it from that vessel. The phrenic and pneumogastric nerve pass between the artery and vein. The veins opening into the subclavian are the external and anterior jugular externally to the scalenus anticus, and the vertebral internally to that muscle. • VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The veins of the lower extremity are deep and superficial. The deep veins accompany the branches of the arteries in pairs, and form the vense comites of the anterior and posterior tibial and pero- neal artery. These veins unite in the popliteal region to form a single vessel of large size, the popliteal, which successively becomes in its course the femoral and the external iliac vein. Popliteal vein.—The popliteal vein ascends through the pop- liteal region, lying, in the first instance, directly upon the artery, and then getting somewhat to its outer side ; and, passing through the oval opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus, becomes the femoral vein. It receives several muscular and articular branches, and the external saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. Femoral vein.—The femoral vein, commencing at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, ascends the thigh in the sheath of the femoral artery, and entering the pelvis beneath Poupart's liga- ment, becomes the external iliac vein. In the lower part of its course it is situated on the outer side of the artery ; it then becomes placed behind that vessel, and at Poupart's ligament, lies to its inner side. It receives the muscular veins and profunda, and, through the saphenous opening, the internal saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. The Prof unda vein is formed by the convergence of the numerous small veins which accompany the branches of the artery: it is a vein of large size, lies in front of the profunda artery, and termi- nates in the femoral at about two inches below Poupart's liga- ment. Superficial veins.—The superficial veins are the external or short, and the internal or long saphenous. They commence on 1) d 2VEINS OF THE TRUNK. 404 the dorsum of the foot in a venous arch which lies across the meta- tarsus ; this venous arch receives the digital veins by its convex side. The External saphenous vein commences at the outer extremity of the venous arch and on the outer border of the foot. It passes behind the outer ankle, ascends along the posterior aspect of the leg, lying in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle, and pierces the deep fascia in the popliteal region to join the popliteal vein. It receives several cutaneous branches in the pop- liteal region previously to perforating the deep fascia, and is in re- lation in its course with the external saphenous nerve. The Internal saphenous vein commences at the inner extremity of the venous arch of the dorsum and on the inner side of the foot and great toe. It ascends in front of the inner ankle and along the inner side of the leg ; it then passes behind the inner condyle of the femur and along the inner side of the thigh to the saphenous opening, where it pierces the sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminates in the femoral vein, at about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. It receives in its course the cutaneous veins of the leg and thigh, and communicates freely with the deep veins. At the saphenous opening it is joined by the superficial epigastric and circumflexa ilii vein, and by the external pudics. The situation of this vein in the thigh is not unfrequently occupied by two or even three trunks of nearly equal size. . VEINS OF THE TRUNK. The veins of the trunk may be divided into, 1. The superior vena cava, with its formative branches. 2. The inferior vena cava, with its formative branches. 3. The azygos veins. 4. The verte- bral and spinal veins. 5. The cardiac veins. 6. The portal vein. 7. The pulmonary veins. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. The Venw innominate are two large trunks, formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian vein at each side of the root of the neck. The Eight vena innominata, about an inch and a quarter in length, lies superficially and externally to the arteria innominata, and descends almost vertically to unite with its fellow of the oppo- site side in the formation of the superior cava. At the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein it receives from behind the ductus lymphaticus dexter, and lower down it has opening into it the right internal mammary, and right inferior thyroid vein. The Left vena innominata, considerably longer than the right,405 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. extends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta to the right side of the mediastinum, where it unites with the right vena innominata, to constitute the superior vena cava. It is in relation in front with the left sterno-clavicular articulation and first piece of the sternum. At its com- mencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left inferior thyroid, left mam- mary, and left superior in- tercostal vein. It also re- ceives some small veins from the mediastinum and thymus gland. There are no valves in the vena? innominate. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The superior cava (descen- dens) is a short trunk about three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two vense innominatse. It descends perpendicularly on the right side of the arch of the aorta * Veins of the trunk and neck. 1. Superior vena cava. 2. Left vena innominata. 3. Right vena innominata. 4.

It is in relation in front with the pericardium ; behind with the right pulmonary artery ; internally with the ascending aorta ; ex- ternally with the pleura and right phrenic nerve. Immediately before entering the pericardium it receives the vena azygos major. INFERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. The External iliac vein lies to the inner side of the corresponding artery at the os pubis ; but gradually gets behind it as it passes upwards along the brim of the pelvis ; it terminates opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis by uniting with the internal iliac, to form the common iliac vein. Immediately above Poupart's ligament it re- ceives the epigastric and circumflexa ilii vein ; it has no valves. The Internal iliac vein is formed by vessels which correspond with the branches of the internal iliac artery; it receives the re- turning blood from the gluteal, ischiatic, internal pudic, and obturator vein, externally to the pelvis ; and from the vesical and uterine plexuses within the pelvis. The vein lies to the inner side of the internal iliac artery, and terminates by uniting with the external iliac vein, to form the common iliac. The vesical and prostatic plexus is an important plexus of veins which surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland, and receives its blood from the great dorsal vein of the penis and the veins of the external organs of generation. It is retained in connexion with the sides of the bladder by a reflection of the pelvic fascia. The uterine plexus is situated around the vagina, and at the sides of the uterus, between the two layers of the broad ligaments. The veins forming the vesical and uterine plexus are peculiarly subject to the production of calcareous concretions termed phlebolites. The Common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac vein at each side of the pelvis. The right com- mon iliac, shorter than the left, ascends obliquely behind the corresponding artery; and on the intervertebral substance of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra, unites with the vein of the opposite side, to form the inferior cava. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique than the right, ascends behind and a little internally to the corresponding artery, and passes beneath the right common iliac artery, near its origin, to unite with the right vein in the formation of the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac vein has no branch ; the left receives the vena sacra media. These veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA. The inferior vena cava is formed by the union of the two common iliac veins, on the intervertebral substance of the fourth and fifthINFERIOR VENA CAVA. 407 lumbar vertebra. It ascends along tbe front of the vertebral column, to the right of the abdominal aorta, and passing through the fissure in the posterior border of the liver and the quadrilateral opening in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, terminates in the inferior and posterior part of the right auricle. There are no valves in this vein. It is in relation from below upwards, in front with the mesentery, transverse duodenum, portal vein, pancreas, and liver, which latter nearly and sometimes completely surrounds it; hehind it rests on the vertebral column and right crus of the diaphragm, from which it is separated by tbe right renal artery and right lumbar arteries ; to the right it has the peritoneum and sympathetic nerve ; to the left the aorta. The Branches which the inferior vena cava receives in its course, are, the The Lumbar veins, three or four in number at each side, collect the venous blood from the muscles and integument of the loins, and spinal veins : the left are longer than the right on account of the position of the vena cava. The Right spermatic vein is formed by the two veins which return the blood from the venous plexus of the spermatic cord. These veins follow the course of the spermatic artery, and unite to form the single trunk which opens into the inferior vena cava. The left spermatic vein terminates in the left renal vein. The Ovarian veins represent the spermatic veins of the male, and collect the venous blood from the ovaries, round ligaments, Fallo- pian tubes, and communicate with the uterine sinuses. They terminate as in the male. The Renal or emulgent veins return the blood from the kidneys ; their branches are situated in front of the divisions of the renal arteries, and the left opens into the vena cava somewhat higher than the right. The left is longer than the right in consequence of the position of the vena cava, and crosses the aorta immediately below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It receives the left spermatic vein, which terminates in it at right angles: hence the more frequent occurrence of varicocele on the left than on the right side. Tbe Supra-renal veins terminate partly in the renal veins, and partly in the inferior vena cava. The Phrenic veins return the blood from the ramifications of the phrenic arteries ; they open into the inferior vena cava. The Hepatic veins form two principal trunks and numerous smaller channels which open into the inferior vena cava, while that vessel is situated in the posterior border of the liver. The hepatic Lumbar, Eight spermatic, Renal, Supra-renal, Phrenic, Hepatic.AZYGOS VEINS. 408 veins commence in the liver by minute venules, the intralobular veins, in the centre of each lobule ; these pour their blood into larger vessels, the sublobular veins ; and the sublobular veins con- stitute, by their convergence and union, the hepatic trunks, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. AZYGOS VEINS. The azygos veins (fig. 169) form a system of communication be- tween the superior and inferior vena cava, and serve to return the , blood from that part of the trunk of the body in which those vessels are deficient, on account of their connexion with the heart. This system consists of four vessels—namely, Vena azygos major, Vena azygos minor, Two superior intercostal veins. The vena azygos major commences in the lumbar region by a communication with the lumbar veins; sometimes it is joined by a branch directly from the inferior vena cava, or by one from the renal vein. It passes through the right crus of the diaphragm, or through the aortic opening, and ascends along the right side of the vertebral column to the third dorsal vertebra, where it arches for- ward over the right bronchus, and terminates in the superior vena cava. It receives all the intercostal veins of the right side with the exception of those of the first and second space, the vena azygos minor, and right bronchial vein. The vena azygos minor commences in the lumbar region, on the left side, by a communication with one of the lumbar veins or with the renal vein. It enters the chest through the left crus of the diaphragm and ascends the left side of the vertebral column, crosses the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra and opens into the vena azygos major. It receives the six or seven lower intercostal veins of the left side. The azygos veins have no valves. The right superior intercostal vein receives the veins of the first and second intercostal space, and opens into the subclavian vein of the same side. The left superior intercostal vein is the trunk formed by the union of the five or six upper intercostal veins of the left side. It communicates below with the vena azygos minor, and crosses the arch of the aorta to terminate in the left vena innominata. It receives the left bronchial vein. VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. The numerous venous plexuses of the vertebral column and spinal cord may be arranged into three groups :— Dorsi-spinal, Meningo-rachidian, Medulli-spinal. The Dorsi-spinal veins form a plexus around the spinous, trans- verse, and articular processes, and arches of the vertebrae. TheyCARDIAC VEINS. 409 receive the returning blood from the dorsal muscles and surrounding • structures, and transmit it, in part to the meningo-rachidian, and in part to the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral veins. The Meningo-rachidian veins are situated between the dura mater spinalis and the vertebrae. They communicate freely with each other by means of a complicated plexus. In front they form twjo longitudinal trunks {longitudinal spinal sinuses), extending the whole length of the column on each side of the posterior common •ligament, and are joined on the body of each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large basi-vertebral veins from the interior of each vertebra. The meningo-rachidian veins communicate superiorly through the ante- rior condyloid foramina with the internal jugulars ; in the neck they pour their blood into the vertebral veins ; in the thorax, into the intercostals ; and in the loins and pelvis into the lumbar and sacral veins, the communications being made through the interver- tebral foramina. The Medulli-spinal veins are situated between the pia mater and arachnoid; they communicate freely with each other to form plexuses ; and send branches through the intervertebral foramina with each of the spinal nerves, to join the veins of the trunk. CARDIAC VEINS. The veins (cardiacse vel coronarise cordis) returning the blood from the substance of the heart are, the Great cardiac vein, Anterior cardiac veins, Posterior cardiac vein, Vense Thebesii. The Great cardiac vein (vena cordis magna ; coronaria magna) commences at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the anterior ventricular groove to the base of the ventricles; it then curves around the left auriculo-ventricular groove to the posterior part of the heart, where it terminates in the right auricle. It receives in its course the left cardiac veins from the left auricle and ventricle, and the posterior cardiac veins from the posterior ventricular groove. The Posterior cardiac vein (vena cordis media), frequently two in number, commences also at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the posterior ventricular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein. It receives the veins at right angles from the poste- rior aspect of the two ventricles. The Anterior pardiac veins (vense parvse), collect the blood from the anterior surface of the right ventricle ; one larger than the rest runs along the right border of the heart and joins the trunk formed by these veins, which curves around the right auriculo-ventricular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein near its entrance into the right auricle; others cross the groove, and open directly into the auricle. * The Vence Thebesii (vense niinimse) are numerous minute venulesPOETAL SYSTEM. 410 which convey the venous blood directly from the substance of the heart into the right auricle. The cardiac veins have no valves, excepting that at the orifice of the great vein. PORTAL SYSTEM. The portal system is composed of four large veins which return the blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; they are the Inferior mesenteric vein, Splenic vein, Superior mesenteric vein, Gastric veins. * The portal vein. 1.

Its hsemorrhoidal branches inosculate with branches of the internal iliac vein, and thus establish a communication between the portal and general venous system. The Superior mesenteric vein is formed by branches which collect the venous blood from the capillaries of the superior mesenteric artery; they constitute by their junction a large trunk, which as- cends by the side of the corresponding artery, crosses the transverse portion of the duodenum, and unites behind the pancreas with the splenic in the formation of the portal vein. The Splenic vein commences in the structure of the spleen, and quits that organ by several large branches; it is larger than the splenic artery, and perfectly straight in its course. It passes hori- zontally inwards behind the pancreas, and terminates near its greater end by uniting with the superior mesenteric and forming the portal vein. It receives in its course the gastric and pancreatic veins, and near its termination the inferior mesenteric vein. The Gastric veins correspond with the gastric, gastro-epiploic, and vasa brevia arteries, and terminate in the splenic vein. The Vena PORTiE, formed by the union of the splenic and supe- rior mesenteric vein behind the pancreas, ascends through the right border of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, one for each lateral lobe. In the right border of the lesser omentum it is situated behind and between the hepatic artery and ductus communis choledochus, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and lymphatics. At the transverse fissure each primary branch divides into numerous secondary branches which ramify through the portal canals, and give off vaginal and interlobular veins, and the latter terminate in the lobular venous plexus of the lobules of the liver. The portal vein within the liver receives the venous blood from the capillaries of the hepatic artery. PULMONARY VEINS. The pulmonary veins (vena? pulmonales), four in number, return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart; they differ from veins in general, in the area of their cylinders being but little larger than that of the corresponding arteries, and in accompanying singly each branch of the pulmonary artery. They commence in the capillaries upon the parietes of the inter- cellular passages and air-cells, and unite to form a single trunk for each lobe. The vein of the middle lobe of the right lung unites with the superior vein, so as to form the two trunks which open into the left auricle. Sometimes they remain separate, and thenPULMONARY VEINS. 412 pulmonary veins. there are three pulmonary veins on the right side. The right pul- monary veins pass behind the right auricle to the left auricle ; the left pass in front of the descending aorta ; they both pierce the pericardium. Within the lung the branches of the pulmonary veins are behind the bronchial tubes, and those of the pulmonary artery in front; but at the root of the lungs the veins are in front, next the arteries, and then the bronchi. There are no valves in the413 CHAPTER VII. OF THE LYMPHATICS. The lymphatic vessels, or absorbents, have received their double appellation from certain phenomena which they present; the former name being derived from the appearance of the limpid fluid (lympha, water) which they convey ; the latter from their supposed property of absorbing foreign substances into the system. They are minute, delicate, and transparent vessels, remarkable for their general uniformity of size, a knotted appearance which is due to the presence of numerous valves, their frequent dichotomous divi- sions, and their division into several branches immediately before entering a gland. Their office is to collect the products of digestion and the detrita of nutrition, and convey them into the venous cir- culation near the heart. Lymphatic vessels commence in a delicate network which is dis- tributed in the cutaneous surface of the body, on the various surfaces of organs, and throughout their internal structure ; and from this network the lymphatic vessels proceed, nearly in straight lines, in a direction towards the root of the neck. In their course they are intercepted by numerous small, spheroid or oblong, or flattened bodies, lymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels entering these glands are termed vasa inferentia or afferentia, and those which quit them, vasa efferentia. The vasa inferentia vary in number from two to six, they divide at the distance of a few lines from the gland into several smaller vessels, and enter it by one of its flattened surfaces.* The vasa efferentia escape from the gland at the opposite, but not unfrequently on the same surface; they consist, like the vasa inferentia at their junction with the gland, of several small vessels which unite after a course of a few lines to form from one to three trunks, often double the size of the vasa inferentia. Lymphatic vessels admit of a threefold division, into superficial, deep, and lacteals. The superficial lymphatic vessels, on the sur- face of the body, follow the course of the veins, and pierce the deep fascia in convenient situations, to join the deep lymphatics. On the surface of organs they converge to the nearest lymphatic trunks. * See Mr. Lane's article on the "Lymphatic System," in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.414 GENERAL ANATOMY OF LYMPHATICS. The superficial lymphatic glands are placed in the most protected situations of the superficial fascia, as in the hollow of the ham and groin in the lower extremity ; on the inner side of the arm in the upper extremity. The deep lymphatics, fewer in number and somewhat larger than the superficial vessels, accompany the deeper veins ; those from the lower parts of the body converging to the numerous glands seated around the iliac veins and inferior vena cava, and terminating in a large trunk situated on the vertebral column, the thoracic duct. From the upper part of the trunk of the body on the left side, and from the left side of the head and neck, they also proceed to the thoracic duct. Those on the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, and right side of the thorax, form a distinct duct which terminates at the point of junction of the subclavian with the internal jugular vein on the right side of the root of the neck. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestines ; they have received their distinctive appellation from conveying the milk-like product of digestion, the chyle, to the great centre of the lymphatic system, the thoracic duct. They are situated in the mesentery, and open into the numerous mesenteric glands in their course. Lymphatic vessels are very generally distributed through the animal tissues ; there are, nevertheless, certain structures in which they have not been detected ; for example, the brain and spinal cord, the eye, bones, cartilages, tendons, the membranes of the ovum, umbilical cord, and placenta. Anastomoses between these vessels are less frequent than between arteries and veins ; they are effected by means of vessels of equal size with the vessels which they connect, and no increase of calibre results from their junction. The lymphatic vessels are smallest in the neck, larger in the upper extremities, and larger still in the lower limbs. For the purpose of effecting the movement of their fluids in a proper direction, lymphatic vessels are furnished with valves, and it is to these that the appearance of constrictions around the cylin- ders of the vessels, at short distances, is due. Like the valves of veins, the valves of lymphatic vessels are each composed of two semilunar flaps attached by their convex border to the sides of the vessels and free by their concave border. This is the general cha- racter of the valves, but, as in veins, there are exceptions in their form and disposition ; sometimes one flap is so small as to be merely rudimentary, while the other is large in proportion ; sometimes the flap runs all the way round the tube, leaving a central aperture, which can only be closed by a contractile power in the valve itself ; and sometimes, instead of being circular, the aperture is elliptical, and the arrangement of the flaps like that of the ileo-csecal valve.* These peculiarities are most frequently met with at and near the * Mr. Lane, loc. cit.GENERAL ANATOMY OF LYMPHATICS. 415 anastomoses of the lymphatic vessels. The valves occur most nu- merously near the lymphatic glands ; next in frequency they are found in the neck and upper extremities where the vessels are small, and least numerously in the lower limbs where the lymphatics are large. In the thoracic duct an interspace of two or three inches frequently occurs between the valves. Connected with the presence of valves in the lymphatic vessels are two lateral dilatations or pouches, analogous to the valvular sinuses of veins. The sinuses are situated on the cardiac side of the valves ; they receive the valves when the latter are thrown back by the current of the lymph ; and when reflux occurs they become distended with a body of fluid which makes pressure on the flaps. These pouch-like dila- tations and the constrictions corresponding with the line of attach- ment of the convex borders of the flaps are the cause of the knotted appearance of distended lymphatic vessels. Like arteries and veins, lymphatic vessels are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external or areolar coat is thin, but very strong, and serves to connect the vessel to sur- rounding tissues, at the same time that it forms a protective cover- ing. It is composed of a network of areolar tissue mingled with fine fibres of elastic tissue and fibres of smooth muscle, arranged in a longitudinal direction; the latter serving to distinguish lympha- tics, as Kolliker observes, from small veins. The middle or mus- cular coat, also thin and elastic, consists of a layer of smooth mus- cular fibres mingled with elastic fibres. These fibres are described by Mr. Lane as longitudinal; by Kolliker as transverse or circular, and analogous to the middle coat of arteries. The internal coat, less elastic and more liable to rupture than the other coats, is com- posed of a longitudinal network of elastic tissue, generally single, but sometimes double, supporting a layer of tesselated epithelium, consisting of nucleated slightly elongated cells. Capillary and minute lymphatics have a single, delicate, structureless, trans- parent coat, with imperfect longitudinal nuclei; the minute lac- teals have a similar structure, but are somewhat thicker. The valves are composed of a very thin layer of areolar tissue coated on its two surfaces by epithelium. The lymphatic glands (conglobate, absorbent) are small oval or bean-shaped, flattened or rounded bodies of a pale red colour, and enclosed in a firm but thin sheath of areolar tissue mingled with fine fibres of elastic tissue. On the exterior the gland has the appearance of being composed of minute lobules, and on the face of a section the lobules are represented by alveolar spaces, bounded by a delicate areolar network, sent inwards by the sheath, and per- meating the entire gland. Some difference of colour and texture may also be perceived between the central and external part of the gland, which has determined its division into a cortical and medul- lary portion, the former being firmer in texture than the latter, which is soft and more or less pulpy. Moreover, the cortical por-416 LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. tion appears to be composed of round, ovate, apparently glandular bodies, while the alveolar spaces of the medullary portion are filled with a greyish white alkaline pulp, containing free nuclei with homogeneous contents, pale nucleated cells, and larger cells with vesicular nuclei and nucleoli, and occasionally some fat granules. The areolar structure of the gland is traversed by vessels, which frequently enter its substance through a hilum-like spot, and di- viding into a capillary plexus in the walls of the alveoli, constitute, with the globular bodies of the cortex and the cells of the medulla, a porous glandular tissue, through which the lymph or chyle makes its way in its passage through the gland, and finally escapes by the vasa efferentia, carrying with it part of the cellular contents of the alveoli. * At their entrance into the gland the vasa inferentia ter- minate abruptly, and their contained fluid is emptied into the alveoli; and as the alveoli communicate freely with each other, forming so many fine anastomosing canals, it is enabled to make its way to the vasa efferentia, probably undergoing some important nutritive change in its course, and receiving the nuclei and nucleated cells of the pulp as its future lymph corpuscles, f The bronchial glands differ in appearance from other lymphatic glands, as being more or less mottled with black, and sometimes filled with a black pigment. Lymphatic glands are larger in the young subject than in the adult, and are smallest in old age ; they, as well as their A^essels, are supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves, like other structures. The vasa vasorum of lymphatics are the same as those of veins; but they are deficient of nerves. I shall describe the lymphatic vessels and glands according to the arrangement adopted for the veins, commencing with those of the head and neck, and proceeding next to those of the upper extremity, lower extremity, and trunk. LV/MPHATICS OP THE HEAD AND NECK. Glands.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the head and face are small, few in number, and isolated ; they are, the occipital, which are situated near the origin of the occipito-frontalis muscle ; posterior auricular, behind the ear ; parotid, in the parotid gland; zygomatic, in the zygomatic fossa; buccal, on the buccinator muscle, and sub-maxillary, beneath the margin of the lower jaw. There are no deep lymphatic glands within the cranium. The Superficial cervical lymphatic glands are few in number and small; they are situated in the course of the external jugular vein, between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscle, at the root of the neck, and about the larynx. The Deep cervical glands (glandulse concatenatse) are numerous and of large size; they are situated around the internal jugular * Ludwig and Noll. t Briicke, 1853.LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 417 vein and sheath of the carotid artery, by tbe side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extend from the base of the skull to the root of the neck, where they are in communication with the lymphatic vessels and glands of the thorax. Vessels.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the head and face are disposed in three groups ; occipital, which take the course of the occipital vein to the occipital and deep cervical glands ; tem- poral, which follow the branches of the temporal vein to the parotid and deep cervical glands ; and facial, which accompany the facial vein to the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the head are the meningeal and cerebral; the former are situated in connexion with the meningeal veins, and escape through foramina at the base of the skull, to join the deep cervical glands. The cerebral lymphatics, according to Fohmann, are situated on the surface of the pia mater, none having as yet been discovered in the substance of the brain. They pass most probably through the foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the face proceed from the nasal fossos, mouth, and pharynx, and terminate in the submaxillary and deep cervical glands. The Superficial and deep cervical lymphatic vessels accompany the jugular veins, passing from gland to gland ; at the root of the neck they communicate with the thoracic lymphatic vessels, and terminate, on the right side, in the ductus lymphaticus dexter ; on the left, in the thoracic duct, near its termination. LYMPHATICS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Glands.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the arm are not more than four or five in number, and of very small size. One or two are situated near the median basilic and median cephalic vein, at the bend of the elbow ; and one or two near the basilic vein, on the inner side of the upper arm, immediately above the elbow. The Deep glands in the forearm are excessively small and infre- quent ; two or three may be found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels. In the upper arm there is a chain of small glands, accompanying the brachial artery. The Axillary glands are numerous and of large size. Some are closely adherent to the vessels, others are dispersed in the loose cellular tissue of the axilla, and a small chain may be observed extending along the lower border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland. Two or three subclavian glands are situated be- neath the clavicle, and serve as the medium of communication be- tween the axillary and deep cervical lymphatic glands. Vessels.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper extre- mity commence on the fingers and take their course along the fore- arm to the bend of the elbow. The greater part reach their desti- E E418 LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. nation by passing along the dorsal surface of the fingers, wrist, and forearm, and then curving around the borders of the latter; but some few are met with in the palm of the hand, which take the direction of the median vein. At the bend of the elbow the lym- phatics arrange themselves into two groups ; an internal and larger group, which communicates with a gland situated just above the inner condyle, and then accompanies the basilic vein upwards to the axilla to enter the axillary glands ; and a smaller group which fol- lows the course of the cephalic vein. Several of the vessels of this group cross the biceps muscle at its upper part to reach the axillary glands, while the remainder, two or three in number, ascend with the cephalic vein in the interspace of the deltoid and pectoralis major; these latter usually join a small gland in this space, and then cross the pectoralis minor muscle to become continuous with the subclavian lymphatics. Besides the lymphatic vessels of the arm, the axillary glands re- ceive those from the integument of the chest, its anterior, posterior, and lateral aspect, and the lymphatics of the mammary gland. The Deep lymphatics accompany the vessels of the upper extre- mity, and communicate occasionally with the superficial lymphatics. They enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and, at the root of the neck, terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. LYMPHATICS OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. GrLANDS.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the lower extre- mity are those of the groin, inguinal; and one or two situated in the superficial fascia of the posterior aspect of the thigh, just above the popliteal region. The Inguinal glands are divisible into two groups ; a superior group of small size, situated along the line of Poupart's ligament, and receiving the lymphatic vessels from the parietes of the abdo- men, gluteal region, perineum, and genital organs ; and an inferior group of larger glands clustered around the internal saphenous vein near its termination, and receiving the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The deep lymphatic glands are the anterior tibial, popliteal, deep inguinal, gluteal, and ischiatic. The Anterior tibial is generally a single gland, placed on the interosseous membrane, by the side of the anterior tibial artery in the upper part of its course. The Popliteal glands, four or five in number, and small, are em- bedded in the loose cellular tissue and fat of the popliteal space. The Deep inguinal glands, less numerous and smaller than the superficial, are situated near the femoral vessels in the groin, beneath the fascia lata. The Gluteal and ischiatic glands are placed near the vessels ofLYMPHATICS OP THE TRUNK. 419 that name, above and below the pyriformis muscle at the great ischiatic foramen. Vessels.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels are divisible into two groups, internal and external; the internal and principal group, commencing on the dorsum and inner side of the foot, ascend the leg by the side of the internal saphenous vein, and, passing behind the inner condyle of the femur, follow the direction of that vein to the groin, where they join the saphenous group of superficial inguinal glands. The greater part of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening and the sheath of the femoral vessels, to join the lymphatic gland situated in the femoral ring, which serves to establish a communication between the lymphatics of the lower extremity and those of the trunk. The other efferent vessels pierce the fascia lata to join the deep glands. The vessels which pass upwards from the outer side of the dorsum of the foot ascend along the outer side of the leg, and curve inwards across the front of the leg just below the knee, to unite with the lymphatics of the inner side of the thigh. The external group consists of a few lymphatic vessels which commence on the outer side of the foot and posterior part of the ankle, and accompany the external saphenous vein to the popliteal region, where they enter the popliteal glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels accompany the deep veins, and com- municate with the various glands in their course. After joining the deep inguinal glands they pass beneath Poupart's ligament, to communicate with the numerous glands situated around the iliac vessels. The deep lymphatics of the gluteal region follow the course of the branches of the gluteal and ischiatic veins. The former join the glands situated on the upper border of the pyriformis muscle, and the latter, after communicating with the lymphatics of the thigh, enter the ischiatic glands. LYMPHATICS OP THE TTUJNK. The lymphatics of the trunk may be arranged under three heads, superficial, deep, and visceral. The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper half of the trunk pass upwards and outwards at each side, and converge, some to the axillary glands, otherg to the glands at the root of the neck. The lymphatics from the mammary glands follow the lower border of the pectoralis major, communicating, by means of a chain of lym- phatic glands, with the axillary glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the lower half of the trunk, gluteal region, perineum, and external organs of generation, converge to the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. One or two small glands are situated at each side of the dorsal vein of the penis, near the suspensory ligament; from these, as from the superficial lymphatics, the efferent vessels pass into the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. E E 2420 LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. Glands.—The Deep lymphatic glands of the thorax are, the intercostal, anterior mediastinal, and oesophageal. The Intercostal glands, of small size, are situated on each side of the vertebral column, near the articulations of the heads of the ribs, and in the course of the intercostal arteries. The Anterior mediastinal glands are situated along the course of the internal mammary arteries ; they are six or seven in number at each side, and receive the lymphatic vessels from the anterior wall of the chest, the mediastinum, thymus gland, and peri- cardium. The (Esophageal glands, fifteen or twenty in number, are situated in the course of the oesophagus, and receive the lymphatics of that tube ; they communicate above with the deep cervical glands, on each side with the intercostal, and below with the abdominal glands. Vessels.—The Deep lymphatic vessels of the thorax are, the intercostal, internal mammary, and diaphragmatic. The Intercostal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins of the same name ; and reaching the vertebral column, curve down- wards, to terminate in the thoracic duct. The Internal mammary lymphatics commence in the parietes of the abdomen, communicating with the epigastric lymphatics. They ascend by the side of the internal mammary vessels, being joined in their course by the anterior intercostals, and terminate at the root of the neck, on the right side in the tributaries of the ductus lymphaticus dexter ; on the left, in the thoracic duct. The dia- phragmatic lymphatics pursue the direction of their corresponding veins, and terminate, some in front, in the internal mammary vessels, and some behind in the posterior mediastinal lymphatics. Glands.—The Beep lymphatic glands of the abdomen are the lumbar glands ; they are numerous, and seated around the common iliac vessels, the aorta, and vena cava. The deep lymphatic glands of the pelvis are the external iliac, internal iliac, and sacral. The External iliac are placed around the external iliac vessels, being in continuation, by one extremity, with the femoral lymphatics; by the other, with the lumbar glands. The Internal iliac glands are situated in thf course of the internal iliac vessels, and the sacral glands rest on the concave surface of the sacrum. Vessels.—The Beep lymphatic vessels are continued upwards from the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament, and along the external iliac vessels to the lumbar glands, receiving in their course the epi- gastric, circumflexa ilii, and ilio-lumbar lymphatic vessels. Those from the parietes of the pelvis, and from the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac veins, and unite with the lumbar lymphatics. And the lumbar lymphatic vessels, after receiving all the lymphatics from the lower extremities,421 LYMPHATICS OP THE VISCERA. pelvis, and loins, terminate by several large trunks in the recepta- culum chyli. LYMPHATICS OP THE VISCERA. Lungs.—The Lymphatic vessels of the lungs, of large size, are distributed over every part of the surface, unci through the texture of those organs : they converge to the bronchial glands, ten or twelve in number, situated around the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs. Some of these glands, of small size, may be traced in connexion with the bronchial tubes into the substance of the lungs. The efferent vessels from the bronchial glands unite with the tracheal and oesophageal glands, and terminate principally in the thoracic duct at the root of the neck, and partly in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. The bronchial glands, in the adult, present a variable tint of brown, and in old age a deep black colour. In in- fancy they have none of this pigment, and are not to be distinguished from lymphatic glands in other situations. Heart.—The Lymphatic vessels of the heart originate in the subserous areolar'tissue of the surface, and in the deeper tissues of that organ, and follow the course of the vessels, principally, along the right border of the heart to the glands situated around the arch of the aorta and to the bronchial glands, whence they proceed to the root of the neck, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The cardiac glands are three or four in number. The pericardiac and thymic lymphatic vessels proceed to join the anterior mediastinal and bronchial glands. ^ Liver.—The Lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into, deep and superficial. The former take their course through the portal canals, and through the right border of the lesser omentum, to the lymphatic glands situated in the course of the hepatic artery and along the lesser curve of the stomach. The superficial lym- phatics are situated in the ai'eolar structure of the proper capsule, over the whole surface of the liver. The lymphatics of the convex surface are divided into two sets :—1. Those which pass from before backwards ; 2. Those which advance from behind forwards. The former unite to form trunks, which enter between the folds of the lateral ligaments at the right and left extremities of the organ, and of the coronary ligament in the middle. Some of these pierce the diaphragm and join the posterior mediastinal glands ; others con- verge to the lymphatic glands situated around the inferior cava. Those which pass from behind forwards consist of two groups : one ascends between the folds of the broad ligament, and perforates the diaphragm, to terminate in the anterior mediastinal glands ; the other curves around the anterior margin of the liver to its concave surface, and from thence to the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum. The lymphatic vessels of the concave surface are variously distributed, according to their position ; those from the right lobe terminate in the lumbar glands ; those from the gall-422 LYMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. bladder, which are large, and form a remarkable plexus, enter the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum ; and those from the left lobe converge to the lymphatic glands situated along the lesser curve of the stomach. Spleen and Pancreas.—The Lymphatic glands of the spleen are situated around its hilum, and those of the pancreas in the course of the splenic vein. The lymphatic vessels of these organs pass through their respective glands, and join the aortic glands, previously to terminating in the thoracic duct. Stomach.—The Lymphatic glands of the stomach, of small size, are situated along the lesser and greater curve of that organ. The lymphatic vessels, as in other viscera, are superficial and deep, the former originating in the subserous, the latter in the submucous tissue ; they pass from the stomach in four different directions: some ascend to the glands situated along the lesser curve ; others descend to those occupying the greater curve ; a third set pass out-, wards to the splenic glands, and a fourth to the glands situated near ■ the pylorus and to the aortic glands. Intestines.—The Lymphatic glands of the small intestine are situated between the layers of the mesentery, in the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric artery, and are thence named mesenteric glands. These glands are most numerous and largest, superiorly, near the duodenum ; and, inferiorly, near the termination of the ileum. The Lymphatic vessels of the small intestines are of two kinds : those of the structure of the intestine, which run upon its surface previously to entering the mesenteric glands ; and those which com- mence in the villi, in the substance of the mucous membrane, and are named lacteals. The Lacteals, according to Henle, commence in the centre of each villus as a csecal tubulus, which opens into a fine network, situated in the submucous tissue. From this network the lacteal vessels proceed to the mesenteric glands, and from thence to the thoracic duct, in which they terminate. The Lymphatic glands of the large intestines are situated along the attached margin of the intestine, in the meshes formed by the colic and hsemorrhoidal arteries previously to their distribution. The Lymphatic vessels take their course in two different directions ; those of the csecum, ascending colon and transverse colon, after tra- versing their proper glands, proceed to the mesenteric glands, and those of the descending colon and rectum to the lumbar glands. Kidney.—The Lymphatic vessels of the kidney follow the direc- tion of the blood-vessels to the lumbar glands situated around the aorta and inferior vena cava ; those of the supra-renal capsules, which are very large and numerous, terminate in the renal lym- phatics. Pelvis.—The Lymphatic vessels of the viscera of the pelvis ter- minate in the sacral and lumbar glands.THORACIC DUCT. 423 The Lymphatic vessels of the testicle take the course of the sper- matic cord, in which they are of large size; they terminate m the lumbar glands.

The nerve-fibres (nerve-tubes ; primitive fibres and tubes) are the chief components of the nerves and of the white substance of the brain and spinal cord, and are also found, but in less number, in the grey substance and ganglia. They are soft and cylindrical, clear and transparent when seen by transmitted light; white, glittering, and opaline when the light is reflected, and bounded by simple, dark, contour lines. They present great variety of size and some degree of variety of texture, being coarse or fine, fragile or firm ; their measurement varies between and ^w of an inch ; and they undergo a structural change after death or under the influence of chemical reagents, which converts them from simple cylinders into cylinders with double boundary lines or contours. of muscular fibre. The medulla or pulp (medullary sheath) is the mid-layer of the nerve-fibre; it is a viscous, transparent, clear, homo- geneous fluid, easily susceptible of coagulation, and converted in its coagulated state into an opaque, granular, white substance. The coagulation of the medulla commences from the exterior, and gives rise to the appearance of double boundary lines in the fibre (dark- bordered fibres) ; and the greater or less extent of the coagulum determines the depth of the interval between the double lines. In the fine nerve-fibres with a more delicate sheath, the medulla is apt to undergo another change, namely, that of collecting from point to point into elliptical masses, and producing varicose .nerve- fibres. In chemical composition the medulla consists chiefly of oily and albuminous matter • its cognomen, medullary sheath, is Fig. 172.* In structure the nerve-fibre is composed of three parts; namely, an external coat or sheath, a medulla or pulp, and a central solid filament or axis- cylinder. The sheath is exces- sively fine and transparent ; so fine and transparent as to be almost invisible or demon- strable only by chemical means, and of doubtful existence even, in the finer fibres. It is elastic and structureless, and corre- sponds in general and chemical characters with the sarcolemmaSTRUCTURE OF NERVE-CELLS. 427 derived from its position, encircling the central filament as in a sbeath; and it is absent in the finest nerve-fibres. The central filament, or axis-fibre (axis-cylinder, Purkinje ; primitive band, Kemak), is a pale, transparent, homogeneous, slightly flattened or cylindrical filament, which occupies the centre of the nerve-fibre. It is about one-third the thickness of the nerve-fibre ; is solid and elastic, sometimes finely granular or striated, and is only brought into view when the fibre is broken up or the medulla dissolved by chemical means. It is also met with in an isolated form, and divested both of sheath and medulla. According to Kolliker, the central filament exists in all nerve-fibres, coarse or fine ; but Valentin and Henle, among other histologists, regard it as simply the uncoagulated portion of the medullary sheath. Kolliker adduces, in support of his views, the constancy of appear- ance of the filament, its chemical constitution as a protein com- pound allied to coagulated albumen, and its presence in nerves still warm with life ; his opinion is probably correct. Besides the medullated or dark bordered nerve-fibres, now de- scribed, there are others which contain no medulla, non-medullated fibres, and which consist only of the central filament invested by the nerve-sheath. The non-medullated nerve-fibres are pale in colour, and bounded by single contour lines ; they are more or less transparent and consistent, and sometimes nucleated; in a word, they present those conditions which distinguish them as nerve- fibres in process of development, and, as such, are the chief con- stituent of the embryonic brain. According to this view, the con- tents of the embryonic fibres separate into two parts, of which the exterior, fluid and viscous, is the medulla, while the unaltered in- terior, firm and solid, is the central filament. Pale non-medullated fibres axe found in connexion with nerve-cells, constituting the pro- cesses of those cells, and sometimes forming the bond of union between the nerve cells and medullated fibres ; they are found also as peripheral continuations of the medullated fibres in the cornea ; in the Pacinian corpuscles ; and as nucleated fibres in the terminal expansion of the olfactory nerves. The nerve-cells (nerve corpuscles) are nucleated cells, occurring in great numbers in the grey or coloured portion of the brain and spinal cord, in ganglia, occasionally in the trunks of certain nerves, and in nervous expansions, as of the optic and auditory nerve. In structure they are composed of a delicate structureless membrane, containing soft, pulpy, greyish contents, and a central nucleated nucleus. In size the nerve-cells vary between and 3~oVu" 0I" an inch in diameter, and the nuclei between .-ytuit an<^ sinnr* The contents of the cells are a clear, homogeneous, colourless, or slightly yellowish matrix, having diffused through it a multitude of minute round granules of nearly uniform size. Sometimes the granules are pale and colourless, or have intermingled with them a small number which are slightly tinged with yellow or grey, and consti- t428 STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. tute colourless nerve-cells. At other times the granules have a brownish or blackish tint, and have mingled with them others of a darker and larger kind ; these are the coloured or pigmentary nerve- cells. Occasionally, the coloured granules are diffused equally- through the mass of the contents, while, in other cells, they are con- gregated near the nucleus, and form a considerable mass. The nucleus is a clear spherical vesicle with a distinct membrane and transparent contents, with one and sometimes two or more large opaque nucleoli. The soft elastic contents of the nerve-cells are a protein compound, analogous to that of the central filament of the nerve-fibres; the opaque granules consisting chiefly of fatty matter and pigment. Nerve-cells present some variety in structure and form ; they may have thin walls, like the cells above described, found in the brain and spinal cord ; or thick walls as in the cells of ganglia. They may be independent cells, or they may be furnished with pale filamentary processes, and be termed according to the number of such processes, unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar cells, the cells without processes being apolar. The processes given off by these cells resemble the non-medullated nerve-fibres, and are sometimes continuous with the medullated fibres; at other times they are branched. The finely granular pale matrix substance is found chiefly in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord ; it is identical with the contents of the nerve-cells. The free cell-nuclei correspond with the nuclei of the nerve-cells, and in certain situations are ac- cumulated in considerable number. These being the elementary constituents of the nervous system, we may now proceed to inquire into their mode of distribution in the spinal cord, the brain, the cerebro-spinal nerves, and sympa- thetic system. Spinal cord.—In the spinal cord the white or medullary-substance occupies the exterior of the organ, while the interior is composed of grey substance. The spinal cord is divided into two lateral halves, by an anterior and posterior fissure, and each lateral half is marked into three parts or columns (funiculi) by an anterior and posterior lateral groove corresponding with the line of attachment of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. At the bottom of the anterior fissure the white substance of one half is continuous with that of the other, constituting the anterior or white commissure. Behind, at the posterior fissure, the white substance of the two halves is in apposition, the fissure being in- dicated, for the greater part of its extent, by the perforations of blood-vessels merely, and existing as a distinct separation only in the upper part of the cervical and in the lumbar region. The grey substance (nucleus), occupying the interior of the spinal cord, con- sists of a transverse portion, which crosses from one half into the other, and two processes which project from the transverse portion429 NERVE-CELLS OF THE SPINAL CORD. forwards and backwards in each lateral half of the cord, so as to present on the face of a section the appearance of a dumb-bell or two irregular crescents, connected by their convex borders. The transverse portion is the grey commissure, and the anterior and posterior projections of the lateral portion the anterior and poste- rior cornua. The white substance of the cord is composed of parallel lon- gitudinal fibres, of uniform size, and diminishes in bulk from above downwards in consequence of the deeper fibres passing inwards to the grey substance, and assuming a transverse or oblique direction ; and subsequently, after undergoing certain alterations of character and size, issuing from the cord as the roots of the spinal nerves. The particular course of these fibres is as follows : proceeding from the brain, the deep fibres of the anterior column of one side of the spinal cord cross the bottom of the anterior fissure, enter the grey substance of the anterior cornu of the opposite side, and become continuous with the fibres of origin of the anterior root of a spinal nerve. The anterior commissure is, therefore, the decussation of the fibres of the anterior columns, and is thickest and broadest where the spinal nerves are largest and most numerous, namely, at the cervical and lumbar swelling of the cord. The deep fibres of the lateral column passing inwards, enter the anterior and pos- terior cornu of the grey substance ; those of the anterior half passing forwards through the anterior cornu, and becoming continuous with the fibres of the anterior root of a spinal nerve ; and those which pass backwards through the posterior cornu becoming con- tinuous with the posterior root. The deep fibres of the posterior column, after entering in the same manner the posterior cornu, divide into two sets, one of which curves outwards and backwards, and enters the posterior root of a spinal nerve ; while the other set passes inwards through the central grey substance to the opposite posterior -column, constituting the posterior or grey commissure. In this manner the anterior root of a spinal nerve is shown to be a continuation of the fibres of the anterior part of the lateral column of its own side, and the anterior column of the opposite side; while the posterior root is a continuation of the fibres of the posterior part of the lateral and part of the posterior column of its own side, and part of the lateral and posterior column of the opposite side. The grey substance (substantia grisea ; grey nucleus) of the cord is most abundant in the lumbar swelling, next in the cervical swell- ing, then in the dorsal portion, and, at the extremity of the cord, is prolonged for a short distance in the filum terminale. In the fcetus it presents a hollow central canal, but in the adult all trace of that canal is obliterated. The anterior cornua are short and thick and of an uniform grey colour ; the posterior cornua, longer and thinner and less uniform in colour, are surrounded by the substantia gela- tinosa of Rolando, which is most abundant at their extremity, and streaked by the fasciculated posterior roots of the spinal nerves.430 STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Fig. 173. The grey substance is composed of nerve-cells and transverse fibres ; the latter, of medium size and fine, extending into the lateral halves of the cord constituting the posterior commissure. The nerve-cells of the grey substance present three principal forms, namely, cells of the central grey substance ; cells of the substantia gelatinosa; and large pigmentary cells. Between the two former, every possible gradation of size and form is also met with. The cells of the central grey substance are pale, finely granular, contain several nuclei, and give off pale branching pro- cesses. The cells of the substantia gelatinosa have a yellowish colour, contain single nuclei, and give off smaller processes, from one to three in number. The pigmentary cells are of large size, and are multipolar or many-rayed cells, giving off numerous, from two to nine or more, branched processes, which terminate in fine fibrils. They are fusiform or polygonal in shape, contain a brown pigment, and are found in the anterior and posterior cornua of the grey substance; in the former compos- ing two groups, which are traversed by the internal and external division of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. The processes of the cells are fine pale fibrils, resembling axis-fibres of the finest kind. The nerve fibresof the grey substance of the spinal cord constitute about half its bulk, and are referrible to three sources, namely, to the roots of the spinal nerves, to the grey substance itself, and to the processes of the nerve- cells. The fibres of the roots of the spinal nerves may be traced through the longitudinal fibres of the white substance into the grey ; they diminish in size as they enter the grey, and become still smaller in the grey substance, being re- duced to half their former size; leaving the grey substance, they Fig. 174.t * Multi-nucleated cells from the central grey substance of the spinal cord; magnified 350 times; after Kolliker.

The anterior roots, at their entrance into the cord, divide into two fasciculi, inner and outer; the inner fasciculus, enter- ing the inner side of the apex of the anterior cornu, passes through the inner group of large multi- polar pigmentary cells, and, fol- lowing the inner half of the cornu, reaches the anterior com- missure, through which it at- tains the opposite side of the cord, and, turning upwards, be- comes continuous with the longi- tudinal fibres of the anterior columns. The outer fasciculus, the larger of the two, passes through the outer part of the anterior cornu and outer group of large multipolar pigmentary cells, and then curves outwards to become continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the ante- rior part of the lateral column. The posterior roots, after pene- trating the white fibres of the exterior of the cord, collect into small fasciculi, which enter the substantia gelatinosa, and then, divided into fibres, pass into the posterior cornu ; in the poste- rior cornu they separate into two portions, posterior and anterior; the posterior portion bends directly backwards, and becomes con- tinuous with the longitudinal fibres of the posterior columns and posterior part of the lateral columns ; while the anterior portion passes in part outwards to become continuous with the posterior part of the lateral columns, and in part inwards to become continuous with the fibres of the posterior column, and cross into the other half of the cord, constituting the posterior commissure, and thence become continuous with the posterior and lateral columns of the opposite side. In pursuing this course the nerve-fibres become diminished in size, their sheath is more delicate, they are more fragile, and they acquire the property of becoming varicose, and in their finest state they appear to lose their sheath entirely and become reduced to their central axis-cylinder; besides which they * Large nerve cells, with branching processes, from the anterior cornu of the spinal cord; after Kolliker.

Medulla oblongata.—In the medulla oblongata the columns of the spinal cord undergo some change of position ; the anterior columns separate from each other and ascend to the outer side of the corpora pyramidalia. A small portion of the anterior column con- stitutes the outer part of the corpus pyramidale, while the larger portion (funiculus olivaris) divides into twofasciculi,/?,mic«^ siliquce, which embrace the corpus olivare, and are then continued through the pons Varolii above the second stratum of transverse fibres, one of the two bundles becoming the laqueus and entering the corpora quadrigemina, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side, the other passing into the upper division, tegmentum, of the crus cerebri. The lateral columns divide into three portions : anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior portion, advancing into the space left by the divergence of the anterior columns, constitutes the corpora pyramidalia, the one corpus pyramidale decussating with the other at the middle line by means of two or three fasciculi. The corpora pyramidalia are continued through the pons Varolii between its first and second transverse layers and enter the lower seg- ment of the crus cerebri. The middle portion, fasciculi inno- minati, continued upwards, make their appearance in the floor of the fourth ventricle under the name of eminentise teretes, and are thence prolonged into the tegmentum of the crura cerebri. The posterior portion unites with the corpus restiforme and enters the crus cerebelli. The posterior columns constitute the fasciculi cuneati and fasciculi graciles ; the former enter the crura cerebelli, while some of their fibres, with the fasciculi graciles, are continued forwards by the side of the eminentise teretes to the tegmentum of the crura cerebri. The tegmentum cruris cerebri therefore becomes the re- cipient of fibres from the anterior, middle, and posterior column. Besides these, which are the longitudinal fibres of the medulla oblongata, there are transverse fibres, which are disposed in three sets ; namely, fibrai arciformes (superficial cerebellar fibres, Solly), which curve superficially to the corpus pyramidale and olivare and take their course to the crus cerebelli; antero-posterior fibres, which pass from before backwards through the middle of the medulla oblongata, forming its raphe ; and lateral fibres, which pass outwards from the raphe into the lateral halves of the medulla ; the most posterior of these fibres (deep cerebellar fibres, Solly) taking their course through the posterior funiculi siliquse and fasciculi cuneati into the crura cerebelli. The grey substance of the medulla oblongata is collected into three principal masses, which are situated respectively in the corpora olivaria, corpora restiformia, and floor of the fourth ventricle ; and, in addition to those, there are smaller collections of grey matter in433 PONS VAROLII.—CEREBELLUM. the corpora pyramidalia and funiculi siliquse. In the corpus olivare the grey matter forms a crumpled oblong capsule of a yellowish- brown colour, open behind, the nucleus olivce (corpus dentatum); and posteriorly to this and on a plane with its upper two-thirds, another yellowish lamella, the nucleus olivce accessorius (Stilling). The grey substance of the corpora restiformia (nucleus cinereus) is a pro- longation upwards of the posterior cornua of the spinal cord, and occupies the interior of the fasciculi laterales, cuneati, and graciles. The grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle is a prolonga- tion upwards of the central substance of the spinal cord ; it forms a thick layer in the floor of the ventricle, extending from the calamus scriptorius to the aqueduct of Sylvius. The grey substance of the medulla oblongata, like that of the spinal cord, is composed of nerve-cells and nerve-fibres. The nerve-cells of the nucleus olivse are small, round, contain yellowish granules which give colour to the nucleus, and have from three to fij»e pro- cesses ; the nerve-cells of the nucleus cinereus of the corpora resti- formia are similar in size to those of the nucleus olivEe,' and 'have similar processes, but are either wanting in pigment or have pigment granules of a brownish hue ; the nerve-cells of the corpora pyrami- dalia and funiculi siliquse are large and caudate, while those of the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle are partly caudate presenting every gradation of size, and partly large with an abundance of pigment granules and finely branched processes. The nerve-fibres of the grey substance of the medulla oblongata are the transverse fibres, which proceed from the raphe, and take their course into, through, and around the nucleus olivse and between the deep longitudinal fibres of the corpora pyramidalia and funiculi siliquse; the nerve fibres are for the most part of the finer kind. Pons Varolii.—The pons Varolii, or great commissure of the cerebellum, is composed of successive layers of white and grey sub- stance, the former consisting of transverse parallel nerve-fibres, the latter of ordinary grey substance, traversed by the longitudinal nerve- fibres of the corpora pyramidalia and funiculi siliquse, the corpora pyramidalia passing between the first and second transverse layers, into the inferior segment of the crura cerebri, the funiculi siliquse above the second transverse layer into the upper segment or tegmen- tum. The grey substance is continuous with that of the medulla oblongata below, and the substantia nigra of the crura cerebri above. Cerebellum.—The great bulk of the cerebellum is composed of white nerve-fibres, the fibres presenting every gradation of magni- tude, from the dark-bordered to the softer non-medullated nerve- fibre, and the slender filaments apparently consisting of the axis- cylinder alone. The grey substance is found in three situations, namely, on the surface, constituting the cortical substance of the convolutions; in the centre of each lateral half of the white substance, ¥ P434 STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Fig. 176. forming the corpus dentaturn ; and in small quantity in the velum medullare inferius of the roof of the fourth ventricle. The cortical substance presents the appearance of two layers of nearly equal thickness, the outer being grey, the inner yellowish-red, substantia ferruginea. The intimate components of the cortical sub- stance are, nerve-fibres, nerve-cells, free cell-nuclei, and a pale yellowish granular substance, which is identical in character with the granular matrix of the nerve-cells. The nerve-fibres proceed from the white medullary substance ; they be- come reduced in the cortical substance to the dimensions of the finest nerve-fibres, form a close plexus by mutual interlacement in the substantia ferruginea and deep layer of the grey substance, and are finally lost towards the middle of the latter. The nerve-cells are of two kinds, small and large ; both are found in the deep layer of the substantia grisea, near the substantia ferruginea. The smaller nerve- cells, the least numerous of the two, are pale, with delicate processes. The large nerve-cells are round, oval, or pyriform in shape, contain a finely-granular colourless substance, and give off from their peripheral side two or three branched processes of considerable size, which take their course towards the granular super- ficial layer. The cell nuclei are found in great numbers in the substantia ferruginea em- bedded among the nerve-fibres, and also in the deep layer of the grey substance among the large and small cells ; and the pale yel- lowish granular substance exists throughout the whole of the substantia grisea, but chiefly in its deep layer. The corpus dentatum is a greyish-red crumpled capsule, containing a large number of yellow pig- mentary cells of medium size, each cell being provided with four or five processes ; and the grey substance of the velum medullare inferius of the fourth ventricle consists of brownish pigmentary cells, intermingled with nerve-fibres. Cerebrum.—The cerebrum has entering into its composition three pairs of ganglia, namely, corpora quadrigemina, * Section of the cortical substance of the cerebellum; after Kolliker. a.

The grey substance of the cerebral ganglia is similar in structure to that of the grey substance of other parts ; it is separate and isolated in the corpora striata, but continuous with the grey sub- stance of the pons Varolii and medulla oblongata in the thalami optici and corpoi'a quadrigemina ; it is also somewhat deeper in colour in the thalami optici than in the corpora quadrigemina, and inseparably commingled with the white fibres. The corpora quadri- gemina and thalami receive their white fibres from the processus e cerebello ad testes, funiculi siliquse, fasciculi innominati, and partly from the corpora restiformia ; while the base of the thalami is traversed by the crura cerebri. The corpus striatum contains two large nuclei of grey substance, nucleus caudatus, which is superior and anterior, and nucleus len- ticularis, inferior and posterior, though both are connected in front; and two smaller and secondary portions, nucleus teniaformis and amygdala. The grey substance is composed of nerve-cells and fine nerve-fibres ; the nerve-cells being partly coloured and partly pigmentary, and provided with from two to five processes. The white nerve-fibres are derived from the corpus pyramidale and lower segment of the crus cerebri. Entering the corpus striatum they collect into fasciculi, which penetrate the first division of the len- ticular nucleus and anterior and thicker portion of the nucleus cau- datus ; they then divide into smaller fasciculi, and, spreading out in a radiated manner, pass successively through the second and ex- ternal layer of the nucleus lenticularis. In their course they are reduced in size to an extreme degree of fineness, and terminate by forming a plexiform interlacement in which they are finally lost. Connected with the central ganglia are other smaller collections of grey substance, namely, the substantia nigra of the crura cerebri, the commissura mollis, pineal gland, floor of the third ventricle, corpora mamillaria, tuber cinereum, and pituitary gland. The sub- stantia nigra is composed of pigmentary nerve-cells similar to those of the substantia ferruginea of the cerebellum, but smaller and pos- sessed of fewer processes. In the commissura mollis the nerve- cells are smaller and paler, with from one to three processes, and mingled with fine plexiform nerve-fibres and a few of the coarser kind. The pineal gland is made up of pale round nerve-cells with- out processes and scattered nerve-fibres, and contains in addition the sabulous matter peculiar to that organ. The peduncles of the gland consist of an admixture of coarse and fine nerve-fibres. In the floor of the third ventricle there are large and small nerve-cells embedded in the meshes of fine nerve-fibres ; the cells are pale, and furnished with from one to four processes often very large. The corpus mamillare is a hollow capsule of white substance, containing grey substance similar to that of the floor of the third ventricle, but with nerve-cells somewhat less in size. The tuber cinereum f f 2STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 436 177* is composed of small cells with not more than one or two pro- cesses. The pituitary gland has a small quantity of fine granular sub- stance, with cell-nuclei and fine fibres in its posterior lobe ; but no nervous elements in the anterior or larger lobe. The grey matter and the nerve-fibres communicate with the tuber cinereum through the medium of the infundibulum. Hemispheres.—The hemispheres are composed of white nerve- fibres, which take a radiated course from the corpus callosum and cerebral ganglia to the surface, where they are invested with grey substance. The fibres are parallel, independent, and undivided, and their average diameter ^nyw of an inch. The grey or cortical substance presents the appearance of three layers ; external, white ; middle, grey ; and internal, yellowish-red. The internal layer occupies about half the thick- ness of the cortical substance, and is marked horizontally by two clear whitish streaks con- sisting of nerve-fibres, one of these streaks being situated at about its middle ; the other at its junction with the grey layer; hence, the section of the cortical substance may be said to exhibit six laminae, distinguished by their colour, as follows : white or external layer ; grey or middle layer ; the four remaining constituting the internal layer, namely, clear whitish streak, yellowish-red la- mina, clear whitish streak, yellowish-red lamina. In structure the cortical substance is com- posed of nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, and a pale granular substance or matrix, which alone con- stitutes the external layer. The nerve-cells are provided with processes, and vary somewhat in the different layers. In the external or white layer, they are few in number and small, with one or two fine processes, and embedded in the pale granular substance. In the middle or grey layer they are abundant and closely aggregated, present every gradation of size from cell-nuclei^ to large cells, are pyriform, fusiform, triangular and polygonal in shape, and provided with three, four, or five branching processes. In the internal or yellowish-red layer they are less numerous than in the middle layer, somewhat paler, but otherwise similar in character, while some contain pigment granules which give the peculiar tint to the layer, especially its deepest stratum. The nerve-fibres of the cortical substance proceed from the medul- lary substance, and after penetrating the yellowish-red layer in * Cortical substance of the hemispheres; after Kolliker. a.

In the grey layer, the white fibres, still more and more attenuated in size, form an intricate plexus among the nerve-cells, while in the external or white layer they cross each other in every direction, forming several superimposed strata, and become so minute as to be ultimately lost to the eye, appearing to terminate in fine loops. The corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and fornix are com- posed of nerve-fibres like those of the medullary substance of the hemispheres. In the corpus callosum, a few greyish streaks and thin deposits of grey substance occur, consisting of cell nuclei and clear vesicles deposited among the white fibres. And the fornix, although containing no grey substance, is closely connected with that substance in various places, as in the thalami optici, corpora mamillaria, floor of the third ventricle, and at its junction with the septum lucidum. The septum lucidum contains nerve-cells like those of the tuber cinereum, and numerous plexuses of the finest nerve-fibres. The hippocampus major and minor are composed of nerve-fibres like those of the medullary substance of the hemispheres ; and also contain grey substance. The olfactory nerves, as a part of the hemispheres, and the optic nerves, as proceeding from the corpora quadrigemina and thalami optici, also call for a passing notice in connexion with the histo- logical structure of the cerebrum. The tractus and bulbus olfacto- rius are composed of finenon-medullated and medullated nerve-fibres, with nerve-cells and a finely granular matrix ; in the bulb the nerve- cells are small and large, the latter provided with branching pro- cesses. The optic nerves, besides their origin from the corpora quadrigemina, corpora geniculata, and thalami optici, are in their course connected with the crura cerebri, substantia perforata, tuber cinereum, and lamina cinerea, and decussate each other in the com- missure. They consist for the most part of dark-bordered nerve- fibres. Origin of nerve-fibres.—The origin of nerve-fibres is still an unsettled question ; they are presumed to arise from the nerve- cells, to be in fact continuations of the processes of those cells ; but in their course in the grey substance they are so minute as to cease to be traceable to their source. Kolliker has seen in the frog the origin of the dark-bordered nerves from the nerve-cells, and this observation has been corroborated by Wagner and others, among fishes. Thus the nerve-fibres of the corpus callosum may be con- sidered as arising from the nerve-cells of the grey substance of one hemisphere and terminating in the other. Spinal nerves.—The roots of the spinal nerves are composed of parallel nerve-fibres, which are larger in the anterior or motor than438 STRUCTURE OP THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. in the posterior or sensitive roots ; they are invested by a thin sheath of pia mater in their course across the sub-arachnoidean space, and the pia mater not only gives them an external sheath, but penetrates into their substance, and forms septa between their individual fasciculi; moreover, at their escape from the dura mater they receive an ad- ditional sheath or neurilemma from that membrane. On each of the posterior roots, at a short distance from the spinal cord, and for the most part externally to the dura mater and vertebral canal, is situated a swelling or ganglion, and beyond this ganglion the an- terior and posterior root are united, the fibres of both being collected together into the same sheath. After the union of the two roots, the fibres run parallel with each other without division, exchanging fasciculi and fibres so as to form plexuses where they are associated in the supply of a separate region, as the neck, the upper and lower extremity, and finally terminating in loops, in free extre- mities, and in reticular anastomosing plexuses. In the roots of the nerves, the nerve-fibres are various in size, some being large and some small, and beyond the ganglion of the posterior root their number is augmented by the addition of ganglionic fibres. They maintain a general uniformity of bulk and are undulated in their course, and, in their peripheral termination, no difference of size is perceptible between the fibres of the motor and sensitive roots. It is, further, to be remarked that communications are not infre- quent between the posterior roots pf the nerves, and especially in the cervical region. The sheath of the nerve, or neurilemma, is a firm membranous layer of areolar tissue which encloses the nerve and sends septa into its interior, forming sheaths for its separate fasciculi and fibres ; in the smallest branches the neurilemma becomes homogeneous and nucleated, and in the large nerves the areolar tissue assumes a fibrous character and is intermingled with simple and reticulated filaments of elastic tissue. In the smaller fasciculi the neurilemma is remarkable for its smooth and polished appearance, and is marked by a peculiar oblique or zig-zag line. The connexion of a nerve with the cerebro-spinal axis is called, for convenience of description, its origin; this term must not, however, be taken literally, for each nerve is developed in the precise situation which it occupies in the body, and with the same relations that it possesses in after life. Indeed, we not unfrequently meet with instances in anencephalous foetuses, where the nerves are completely formed, while the brain and spinal cord are wanting. In their distribution the spinal nerves for the most part follow the course of the arteries, particularly in the limbs, where they lie almost con- stantly to the outer side of and superficially to the vessels, as if for the purpose of receiving the first intimation of danger, and com- municating it to the muscles, that the latter may instantly remove the arteries from impending injury. The cerebral nerves, from the third to the hypoglossal, resemble439 NERVOUS GANGLIA. Fig. 178.; (flHf& in histological characters the spinal nerves, the motor nerves corre- sponding with the anterior roots, the sensitive nerves with the pos- terior roots ; but it is to be remarked that the motor nerves receive sensitive fibres from the nerves of sensation previously to their escape from the cranium. The fifth, glosso-pharyngeal and pneumo- gastric nerves have both a motor and a sensitive root with a ganglion on the latter like the posterior root of the spinal nerve. The ganglion of a spinal nerve is formed by the accumulation of nerve-cells (ganglion-cells, or globules) around and between the nerve-fibres of the posterior root. The ganglion-cells are round, a little flattened by mutual compression, elongated or pyriform in shape, and enclosed in a thin layer of imperfect areolar tissue which forms a sheath for the ganglion, and septa for the gan- glion-cells, frequently supplying the latter with individual sheaths. The nerve-fibres take their course through the ganglion in one or several plexiform fasciculi, and are joined on their escape from its substance by the ganglionic fibres derived from the ganglion-cells. The ganglion-cells are composed of an outer coat, consisting of two layers, a fine granular matrix substance con- taining yellowish or brownish pigment cells in greater or less number, and a nucleolated nucleus; besides which they give off for the most part one, and frequently two, pale processes, the com- mencement of the ganglionic fibres, a few of the cells appearing to have no processes. The external portion of the coat of the ganglion-cell is a thick nucleated layer, composed of a more or less homogeneous or fibrous and im- perfect areolar tissue, and continued on the ganglionic fibre to its point of exit from the ganglion ; the internal layer is a thin proper membrane. The pigment cells are frequently aggregated into a rounded mass near the nucleus and deepen in colour with age. The ganglionic fibres are pale, consisting of tubular prolongation of the nucleated and proper coat of the ganglion-cell, enclosing a granular substance identical with that of the cell-matrix.

Fiq. m* take their course to the exterior of the nervous fasciculi, interlacing them in various directions and seeming to hold them together, and frequently making one or more turns around the ganglion-cells "before proceeding to join the nerve-fibres. They are at first fine, but soon increase in size, and are gradually converted by the deve- lopment of a medullary sheath into dark-bordered nerve-fibres of medium size. The ganglionic fibres are probably distributed with the blood-vessels to the integuments, muscles, bones, joints, ten- dons, membranes, and glands, while the fibres of the motor roots are destined for the voluntary muscles, and the sensitive nerves for the exposed parts of the mucous membrane and skin. In their ultimate distribution, nerve-fibres terminate in loops, in fine plexuses, and in free extremities, instances of all these modes of termination, together with division of fibres, being met with in the skin : loops are well seen in the papillae of that membrane, terminal plexuses in the conjunctiva scleroticse, and free extremities in the conjunctiva and Pacinian bodies. The Pacinian bodies are small oval or pyriform masses, varying in size from half a line to three lines in length, situated on the peripheral extremities of the nerve-fibres chiefly in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, but also found in other parts, as the perineum, glans penis, bulb of the urethra, on the intercostal nerves, on the cutaneous nerves of the neck, arm, and leg, and dorsum of the hand and foot, and on the filaments of the sympathetic nerve in various localities. It has been cal- culated that in the palm of the hand and palmar surface of the fingers there are six hundred of these bodies, and at the extremi- ties of the fingers they are especially nume- rous. They are situated for the most part in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, are clear, S^V| f transparent, and glistening in appearance, and traversed internally with white streaks. In structure a Pacinian body is composed of from twenty to sixty concentric layers or capsules of areolar tissue, separated by spaces containing a serous fluid, and having a central cavity also filled with serous fluid, which contains the free extremity of a nerve-fibre, divested of its sheath and medulla, and reduced to the condition of an axis-cylinder. The intercap- sular spaces are wider between the external than the internal layers, and closing around the nerve-fibre at its entrance into the r * Portion of a digital nerve, showing the disposition of the Pacinian cor- puscles ; reduced after Kolliker.441 STRUCTURE OF SYMPATHETIC NERVE. corpuscle are continued for some distance on the fibre to constitute its sheath. The nerve-fibre included within the central cavity ends in a small rounded tubercle, and not unfre- quently is bifid or even trifid. The Pacinian Fig. 180.* corpuscles are first apparent during the sixth month of foetal life. Sympathetic nerve.—The sympathetic or ganglionic nerve, or system of organic nerves, has received its various designations from its numberless communications and anastomoses from its composition of a series of ganglia and from its distribution chiefly to the viscera of the body. It consists of a cord of moderate thickness, which extends from the head to the coccyx, lying by the side of the vertebral co- lumn, of a series of ganglia, some of which are fusiform and others flattened and multangular, of short branches of communication from the spinal nerves, and, peripheral branches which for the most part follow the trunks of arte- ries, and are distributed to the viscera, after ^ uniting with ganglia in their course, or form- ing smaller ganglia in their distribution. The elementary constituents of the ganglionic nerve are ; white nerve- fibres of every degree of magnitude from coarse to fine ; ganglionic nerves, and nerve-cells. The ganglia resemble in structure those of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, but the nerve-cells are smaller, more uniformly round, pale and colourless or slightly tinged with pigment, and provided with a single process, sometimes two, and more rarely none ; the ganglionic nerve. After one or two turns around and between the nerve-cells, the ganglionic nerve takes its course to the periphery of the ganglion and united with other fibres constitutes the nervous cords. The ganglionic nerves are dark-bordered and pale. The white nerve-fibres are derived from the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, chiefly from the latter ; entering the ganglion, they divide into an ascending and descending fasciculus, which pass upwards and downwards along the main trunk of the nerve, or pass off with the larger branches in company with ganglionic nerves. The branches of the sympathetic nerve present some difference of colour, having reference to the greater or less preponderance of the white or ganglionic fibres; thus the splanchnic nerves are white, the mesenteric branches greyish-white ; and the filaments ramifying on the branches of the carotid arteries reddish-grey and soft (nervi sub- * A Pacinian corpuscle; after Kolliker. a.

Some part of the greyness of these nerves is also due to the presence of certain peculiar fibres, the grey- fibres of Remak (gelatinous fibres, Henle). The grey fibres of Remak are pale flat fibres, indistinctly striated, granular or homogeneous, and presenting elongated or fusiform nuclei, in fact presenting charac- ters similar to imperfectly formed areolar tissue, to which substance they probably belong. Remak finds them in great abun- dance in the impregnated uterus, indeed o more numerous than the nerve-fibres, and they seem to constitute the basis of many of the nerves. They are probably derived from the neurilemma of the finer branches. In their peripheral terminations the branches of the sympathetic nerve present numerous minute, almost microscopic gan- glia, which are especially remarkable on the carotid arteries, in the pharyngeal plexus, upon the heart, around the root and in the substance of the lungs, upon the supra-renal capsule, on the lymphatic glands, on the posterior wall of the urinary bladder, and occasionally in the kidneys. In structure these ganglia are identical with the larger ganglia. The nerve-fibres, like those of the cerebro-spinal system, terminate in loops, in fine plexuses, and in free ends, the latter being present in the Pacinian corpuscles of the mesentery. In their ultimate terminations they probably cease to be medullated and become reduced to their axis fibres. Development. — Nerve-cells and nerve-fibres are developed from the primary cells of which the embryo is originally composed; the nerve-cells increase in size, and either retain the character of simple cells or throw out processes which become connected with nerve-fibres. Some of the nerve-cells, provided with two nuclei, appear to increase by division. Nerve-fibres are produced from fusiform nucleated cells, which are united into pale, flattened, nu- cleated tubules or fibres ; and at about the middle period of foetal life they become white from the development of the medullary sheath. In the peripheral plexuses, the anastomosis of fibres results from their development by fusiform or stellate cells, the * A sympathetic ganglion from a puppy, made transparent by soda; after Kolliker. a, a.

In the cerebro-spinal centre, nerve-fibres are first perceptible in the embryo at the end of the second month, at which time they are intermingled with an abundance of fusiform cells with fine lengthened ends. At the fourth month the grey and the white substance are distinct; but dark contours to the fibres do not make their appear- ance until the mid-period of foetal life, and are first discoverable in the spinal cord. The subsequent changes are, increase of size of the fibres, the number of primitive fibres existing in the foetus being as great as in the adult. Vessels.—The brain and spinal cord are very moderately supplied with blood by small arteries which enter their substance from the pia mater, and divide into branches at acute angles. In the medullary substance they form a network of fine capillaries with wide meshes ; but the network is closer and the capillaries more abundant in the grey substance. The ganglia of the nerves possess a delicate capillary plexus which pervades their structure, encircling each cell in a special web; the arteries of the nerves are more scanty and for the most part longitudinal, forming an open network with elongated interstices, which invests the fasciculi but does not penetrate to the nerve-fibres. In the Pacinian corpuscles, blood- vessels reach the interior of the central cavity. The Nervous system may be divided for convenience of descrip- tion into, 1. The brain. 2. The spinal cord. 3. The cranial nerves. 4. The spinal nerves. 5. The sympathetic system. THE BRAIN. The brain is a collective term which signifies those parts of the nervous system, exclusive of the nerves themselves, which are con- tained within the cranium ; they are, the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. * These are invested and protected by the mem- branes of the brain, and the whole together constitute the ence- phalon (iv KecpaXr), within the head).

After the calvarkim has been loosened all round, it will require a considerable degree of force to tear the bone away from the dura mater. This adhesion is particularly firm at the sutures, where the dura mater is continuous with a membranous layer, in- terposed between the edges of the tjones ; in other situations the connexion results from numerous vessels which permeate the inner table of the skull. The adhesion subsisting between the dura mater and bone is greater in the young subject and in old persons than in the adult. On being torn away, the internal table will present numerous deeply-grooved and ramified channels, corresponding with the branches of the arteria meningea media. Along the middle line will be seen a groove corresponding with the superior longitu- dinal sinus, and on either side may be frequently observed some small fossa?, corresponding with the Pacchionian bodies. The membranes of the encephalon and spinal cord are, the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. The Dura mater* is the firm, whitish or greyish layer which is brought into view when the calvarium is removed. It is a strong fibrous membrane, somewhat laminated in texture, and composed of white fibrous tissue. Lining the interior of the cranium, it serves as the internal periosteum of that cavity ; it is prolonged also into the spinal column, but is not adherent to the bones in that canal as in the cranium. From the internal surface of the dura mater, processes are directed inwards for the support and protec- tion of parts of the brain ; while from its exterior, other processes are prolonged outwards to form sheaths for the nerves as they quit the skull and spinal column. Its external surface is rough and fibrous, and corresponds with the internal table of the skull. The internal surface is smooth, and lined by the thin varnish-like lamella of the arachnoid membrane. The latter is a serous mem- brane. Hence the dura mater becomes a fibro-serous membrane, being composed of its own proper fibrous structure, and the serous layer derived from the arachnoid. There are two other instances of fibro-serous membrane in the body, formed in the same way, namely, the pericardium and tunica albuginea of the testicle. On the external surface of the dura mater the branches of the middle meningeal artery may be seen ramifying ; and in the middle line is a depressed groove, formed by the subsidence of the upper wall of the superior longitudinal sinus. If the sinus be opened along its course, it will be found to be a triangular channel, crossed at its lower angle by numerous white bands, called chordae Willisii;+ granular bodies are also occasionally seen in its interior, these are the glandulse Pacchioni. * So named from a supposition that it was the parent source of all the fibrous membranes of the body. t Willis lived in the seventeenth century; he was a great defender of the opinions of Harvey.DUEA MATER. 445 The Glandulce Pacchioni* are small, round, whitish granula- tions, occurring singly or in clusters, and forming small groups of various size along the margin of the longitudinal fissure of the cere- brum, and more particularly near the summit of the latter. These bodies would seem to be of morbid origin ; they are absent in infancy, increase in numbers in adult life, and are abundant in the aged. They are generally associated with opacity of the arachnoid around their bases, but in some instances are wanting even in the adult. They have their point of attachment in the pia mater, from which they seem to spring, carrying with them the arachnoid mem- brane, and then, in proportion to their size, producing various effects upon contiguous parts. For example, when small, they remain free or constitute a bond of adhesion between the visceral and parietal layer of the arachnoid ; when of larger size they pro- duce absorption of the dura mater, and as the degree of absorption is greater or less, they protrude through that membrane, and form depressions on the inner surface of the cranium, or simply render the dura mater thin and cribriform. Sometimes they cause absorp- tion of the wall of the longitudinal sinus, and projecting into its cavity, give rise to the granulations described in connexion with that channel. In intimate structure they are composed of immature areolar and elastic tissue containing corpuscula amylacea. If the student cut through one side of the dura mater, in the direction of his incision through the skull, and turn it upwards towards the middle line, he will observe the smooth internal surface of this membrane. He will perceive also the large veins of the hemispheres filled with dark blood, and passing from behind for- wards to open into the superior longitudinal sinus ; and the firm connexion, by means of these veins and the Pacchionian bodies, between the opposed surfaces of the arachnoid membrane. If he separate these adhesions with his scalpel, he will see a vertical layer of dura mater descending between the hemispheres ; and if he draw one side of the brain a little outwards, he will be enabled to perceive the extent of the process of membrane, which is called the falx cerebri. The processes of dura mater which are sent inwards towards the interior of the skull are the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and falx cerebelli. The Falx cerebri (falx, a sickle), so named from its sickle-like appearance, narrow in front, broad behind, and forming a sharp curved edge below, is attached in front to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone, and behind to the tentorium cerebelli. The Tentorium cerebelli (tentorium, a tent) is a roof of dura * These bodies are incorrectly described as conglobate glands by Pacchioni, in an epistolatory dissertation.

It supports the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and prevents their pressure* on the cerebellum, leaving a small opening anteriorly, for the transmission of the crura cerebri. The Falx cerebelli is a small process, generally double, attached to the vertical ridge of the occipital bone beneath the lateral sinus, and to the tentorium. It is received into the indentation between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. The layers of the dura mater separate in several situations, so as to form irregular channels which receive the venous blood. These are the sinuses of the dura mater, already described ; page 396. The student cannot see the tentorium and falx cerebelli until the brain is removed ; but he should consider the attachments of the former on the dried skull, for he will have to incise it in the re- moval of the brain. He should now proceed to that operation, for which purpose the dura mater is to be divided all round, on a level with the section through the skull, and the scissors are to be car- ried deeply between the hemispheres of the brain in front, to cut through the anterior part of the falx ; then draw the dura mater backwards, and leave it hanging by its attachment to the tentorium. Raise the anterior lobes of the brain carefully with the hand, and lift the olfactory bulbs from the cribriform fossse with the handle of the scalpel. Then cut across the two optic nerves and internal carotid arteries. Next divide the infundibulum and third nerves, and carry the knife along the margin of the petrous bone at each side, so as to divide the tentorium near its attachment. Cut across the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves in succession with a sharp knife, and pass the scalpel as far down as possible into the vertebral canal, to sever the spinal cord, cutting first to one side and then to the other, in order to divide the vertebral arteries and first cervical nerves. Then let him press the cerebellum gently upwards with the fingers of the right hand, the hemi- spheres being supported with the left, and the brain will roll into his hand. The A rteries of the dura mater are, the anterior meningeal from the ethmoidal, ophthalmic, and internal carotid. The middle meningeal and meningea parva from the internal maxillary. The inferior meningeal from the ascending pharyngeal and occipital artery ; and the posterior meningeal from the vertebral. Its Nerves are derived from the nervi molles and vertebral plexus of the sympathetic, from the Casserian ganglion, the ophthalmic * In leaping animals, as the feline and canine genera, the tentorium forms a bony tent.447 ARACHNOID MEMBRANE. nerve, and sometimes from the fourth. The branches from the two latter are given off while those nerves are situated by the side of the sella turcica ; they are recurrent, and pass backwards between the layers of the tentorium, to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. Purkinje describes a sympathetic plexus of considerable size, as being situated around the vena Graleni at its entrance into the fourth sinus. The filaments from this plexus are distributed to the tentorium. Kolliker describes the dura mater as composed of two lamellae, periosteal and proper fibrous, the former adheres to the bones, the latter forms the internal processes, whilst the sinuses result from the separation of the two. He finds nothing to indicate the lining of the internal surface by the arachnoid as a separate membrane ; but shows that the tesselated epithelium of the free surface is in contact with, and bedded upon the fibrous structure. Arachnoid membrane. The Arachnoid (apdxvn eldos, like a spider's web), so named from its extreme tenuity, is the serous membrane of the cerebro- spinal centre ; and, like other serous membranes, a shut sac. It envelopes the brain and spinal cord, visceral layer, and is reflected on the inner surface of the dura mater, parietal layer, giving to that membrane its serous investment. On the upper surface of the hemispheres the arachnoid is trans- parent, but may be demonstrated as it passes across the sulci from one convolution to another by injecting with a blow-pipe a stream of air beneath it. At the base of the brain the membrane is opa- lescent and thicker than in other situations, and more easily demon- strable from the circumstance of stretching across the interval be- tween the middle lobes of the hemispheres. The space which is in- cluded between this layer of membrane and those parts of the base of the brain which are bounded by the optic commissure and fissures of Sylvius in front, and the pons Varolii behind, is termed the ante- rior sub-arachnoiclean space. Another space formed in a similar manner between the under part of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata, is the posterior sub-arachnoidean space; and a third space, situated over the corpora quadrigemina may be termed the stiperior sub-arachnoidean space. These spaces communicate freely with each other, the anterior and posterior across the crura cere- belli, the anterior and the superior around the crura cerebri, and the latter and the posterior across the cerebellum in the course of the vermiform processes. They communicate also with a still larger space formed by the loose disposition of the arachnoid around the spinal cord, the spinal sub-arachnoidean space. The whoie of these spaces, with the lesser spaces between the convolutions of the hemispheres, constitute one large and continuous cavity which is filled448 PIA MATER. with a limpid serous secretion, the sub-arachnoid ean or cerebro- spinal fluid,* a fluid which is necessary for the regulation of pres- sure, and protection of the cerebro-spinal mass. The quantity of the cerebro-spinal fluid is determined by the relative size of the cerebro-spinal axis and that of the containing cavity, and is conse- quently variable. It is smaller in youth than in old age, and in the adult has been estimated at about two ounces. The visceral layer of the arachnoid is connected to the pia mater by a delicate areolar tissue, which in the sub-arachnoidean space is loose and filamentous. The serous secretion of the true cavity of the arach- noid is very small in quantity as compared with the sub-arachnoi- dean fluid. The arachnoid does not enter into the ventricles of the brain, as imagined by Bichat, but is reflected inwards upon the venae Galeni for a short distance only, and returns upon those vessels to the dura mater of the tentorium. It surrounds the nerves as they originate from the brain, and forms a sheath around them to their point of exit from the skull. It is then reflected back upon the inner sur- face of the dura mater. According to Mr. Rainey^ vessels of considerable size, but. few in number, and branches of cranial nerves, are found in the arachnoid. He also describes, in this membrane, numberless plexuses and ganglia, which he considers to be analogous to those of the sympa- thetic nerve ; but which are most probably, as Kolliker observes, reticular, anastomosing fasciculi of areolar tissue. These fasciculi united into lamella? are the constituent structure of the arachnoid membrane, and many of the fasciculi have fibres of elastic tissue twined around them. The external surface of the arachnoid is fur- nished with a tesselated epithelium identical with that of the dura mater. Pia mater. The Pia mater is an areolo-vascular membrane composed of innu- merable vessels held together by immature areolar tissue. It in- vests the whole surface of the brain, dipping into the sulci between the convolutions, and forming a fold in its interior called velum interpositum. It also forms folds in other situations, as in the third and fourth ventricles, and in the longitudinal fissures of the spinal cord. This membrane differs in structure in different parts of the cerebro-spinal axis. Thus, on the surface of the cerebrum, in contact with the soft grey matter of the brain, it is extremely vascular, forming remarkable loops of anastomosis in the interspaces of the * The presence of a serous fluid beneath the arachnoid has given rise to the conjecture that a sub-arachnoid serous membrane may exist in that situation. Such a supposition is quite unnecessary to explain the production of the secretion, since the pia mater is fully adequate to the function. t Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. 29.CEREBRUM. 449 convolutions, and distributing multitudes of minute straight vessels (tomeutum cerebri) to the grey substance. In the substantia per- forata, again, and locus perforatus, it gives off tufts of small arteries, wbicb pierce the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. But upon the crura cerebri, pons Varolii, and spinal cord, its -vascular character seems almost lost. It has become a dense fibrous membrane, difficult to tear off, and forming the proper sheath of the spinal cord. The pia mater is the nutrient membrane of the brain, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Lym- phatics have also been desci-ibed as entering into its structure. Its Nerves are the minute filaments of the sympathetic, and fila- ments from the sensory cranial nerves ; they accompany the branches of the arteries. CEREBRUM. The Cerebrum presents on its surface a number of slightly convex elevations, the convolutions (gyri), which are separated from each other by sulci of various depth. * It is divided superiorly into two hemispheres by the great longitudinal fissure, which lodges the falx cerebri, and marks the original development of the brain by two symmetrical halves. Each hemisphere, on its under surface, admits of division into three lobes, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior lobe rests on the roof of the orbit, and is separated from the middle by the fissure of Sylvius. + The middle lobe is received into the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and is separated from the posterior by a slight impression produced by the ridge of the petrous bone. The 'posteri.or lobe is supported by the tentorium. If the upper part of one hemisphere, at about one-third from its summit, be removed with a scalpel, a centre of white substance will be observed, surrounded by a narrow border of grey, which follows the line of the sulci and convolutions, and presents a zigzag form. This section, from exhibiting the largest surface of medullary substance demonstrable in a single hemisphere, is called centrum ovale minus; it is spotted by numerous small red points (puncta vasculosa), which are produced by the escape of blood from the cut ends of minute arteries and veins. Separate carefully the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, and a broad band of white substance (corpus callosum) will be seen to con- nect them; it will be seen also that the surface of the hemisphere, * In estimating the surface of the brain, which, according to Baillarger, averages in round numbers, 670 square inches, these convolutions and the lamina? of the cerebellum are supposed to be unfolded. t James Dubois, a celebrated professor of anatomy in Paris, where he suc- ceeded Vidius in 1550, although known much earlier by his works and disco- veries, but particularly by his violence in the defence of Galen. His name was latinised to Jacobus Sylvius. G GCORPUS CALLOSUM. 450 where it comes in contact with the corpus callosum, is bounded by a large convolution (gyrus fornicatus) which lies horizontally on that body, and may be traced forwards and backwards to the base of the brain, terminating by each extremity at the fissure of Sylvius. The sulcus between this convolution and the corpus callosum has been termed the " ventricle of the corpus callosum," and some longitu- dinal fibres (strise longitudinales laterales), which are brought into view when the convolution is raised, were called by Rett the " covered band." If the upper part of each hemisphere be re- moved to a level with the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medullary matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey-substance corresponding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemi- spheres, will be seen; this is the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens. The Corpus callosum (callosus, hard) is a thick layer of medullary fibres passing transversely between the two hemispheres, and con- stituting their great commissure (trabs cerebri, beam of the brain). * Section of the brain showing the centrum ovale majus and corpus callo- sum. 1,1.

It is situated in the middle line of the centrum ovale majus, but nearer the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, and termi- nates anteriorly in a rounded border, genu, which may be traced downwards to the base of the brain in front of the commissure of the optic nerves. Posteriorly it forms a thick rounded fold, splenium, •which is continuous with the fornix. The length of the corpus callosum is about four inches. Beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum is the transverse fissure of the cerebrum, which extends between the hemispheres and crura cerebri from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, to the same point on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the velum interpositum. And it was here that Bichat conceived the arachnoid to enter the ventricles ; hence it is also named the fissure of Bichat. Along the middle line of the corpus callosum is the raphe, a linear depression between two slightly elevated longitudinal bands (chordae longitudinales, Lancisii); and, on either side of the raphe, may be seen the linece transversa, which mark the direction of the fibres of which the corpus callosum is composed. These fibres may be traced into the hemispheres on either side, and they will be seen to be crossed at about an inch from the raphe by the longitudinal fibres of the covered band of Reil. Anteriorly and posteriorly the fibres of the corpus callosum curve forwards and backwards into their corresponding lobes. If a superficial incision be made through the corpus callosum on either side of the raphe, two irregular cavities will be opened, which extend from one extremity of the hemispheres to the other : these are the lateral ventricles. To expose them completely, their upper boundary should be removed with the scissors. In making this dissection the thin and diaphanous membrane of the ventricles may frequently be seen. Lateral ventricles.—Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central cavity and three smaller cavities called cornua. The an- terior cornu curves forwards and outwards in the anterior lobe ; the middle cornu descends into the middle lobe; and the posterior cornu passes backwards in the posterior lobe, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. The central cavity is triangular in form, being bounded above (roof) by the corpus callosum ; internally by the septum lucidum, which separates it from the opposite ventricle; and below (floor) by the following parts, taken in their order of position from before backwards :— Corpus striatum, Choroid plexus, Tenia semicircularis, Corpus fimbriatum, Thalamus opticus, Fornix. The Corpus striatum is named from the striated lines of white and grey matter which are seen upon cutting into its substance. It g g 2452 LATERAL VENTRICLES. is grey on the exterior, and of a pyriforni shape. The broad end, directed forwards, rests against the corpus striatum of the opposite side : the small end, backwards, is separated from its fellow by the interposition of the thalami optici. The corpora striata are the superior ganglia of the cerebrum. The Tenia semicircular is (tenia, a fillet) is a narrow band of medullary substance, extending along the posterior border of the corpus striatum, and serving as a bond of connexion between that body and the thalamus opticus. It is transparent and dense at the surface, and received from Tarinus* the name of horny band. The tenia is partly concealed by a large vein (vena corporis striati), which receives numerous small veins from the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, and terminates in the vena Graleni of its own side. The Thalamus opticus (thalamus, a bed) is an oblong body, having a thin coating of white substance on its surface ; and has received its name from giving origin to one root of the optic nerve. It is the inferior ganglion of the cerebrum. Part only of the thala- mus is seen in the floor of the lateral ventricle; we must, therefore, defer its further description until we can examine it in its entire extent. The Choroid plexus (xo/nof, elbos, resembling the chorion)f is a vascular fringe extending obliquely across the floor of the lateral ventricle, and sinking into the middle cornu. Anteriorly, it is small and tapering, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventricle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius. This foramen may be seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum lucidum with the handle of the knife. It is situated between the under surface of the fornix, and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, and forms a communication transversely between the lateral ventricles, and perpendicularly with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus presents on its surface a number of minute vascular processes, which are termed villi. They are invested by an epithelium consisting of a single layer of nucleated polygonal cells surmounted by cilia, which have been seen in motion in the embryo. Besides the nucleus the cells contain numerous yellow granules and one or two dark oil drops ; and, according to Henle, give off from their angles spine-like processes, which are connected with the bed of homogeneous areolar tissue on which they rest. The vessels composing the plexus are connected by a transparent interstitial substance without areolar tissue ; and the latter is often interspersed with calcareous particles. Sometimes the plexuses pi-esent on their surface an assemblage of small serous cysts. * Peter Tarin, a French anatomist; his work, entitled "Adversaria Anato- raica," was published in 1750. t See the note appended to the description of the choroid coat of the cy ball.LATERAL VENTRICLES. 453 ^ The Corpus fimbriatum is a narrow white band, situated imme- diately behind the choroid plexus, and extending with it into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thin edge of the fornix, and being attached to the hippocampus * Lateral ventricles of the cerebrum. 1,1. The two hemispheres cut down to a level with the corpus callosum so as to constitute the centrum ovale majus.

The figure 11 rests on the edge of the fornix, on that part of it which is called, corpus fimbriatum. 12. Fornix. 13. Commencement of the hippo- campus major descending into the middle cornu. The rounded oblong body, directly behind figure 13, is the pes accessorius, and farther back, immediately under figure 7, the hippocampus minor.LATERAL VENTRICLES. 454 major in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, is also termed, tenia hippocampi. The Fornix is a white layer of medullary substance, of which a portion only is seen in this view of the ventricle. The Anterior cornu is triangular in form, sweeping outwards, and terminating by a point in the anterior lobe of the brain, at a short distance from its surface. The Posterior cornu or digital cavity curves inwards, as it ex- tends back into the posterior lobe of the brain, and likewise ter- minates near the surface. An elevation corresponding with a deep sulcus between two convolutions, projects into the area of this cornu, and is called the hippocampus minor. The Middle or descending cornu, in descending into the middle lobe of the brain, forms a very considerable curve, and alters its direction several times as it proceeds. Hence it is described as passing backwards and outwards and downwards, and then turning forwards and inwards. This complex expression of a very simple curve has given origin to a symbol, formed of the primary letters of the term, by which the student is enabled to recollect more easily the course of the cornu, bodfi. It is the largest of the three cornua, and terminates close to the fissure of Sylvius, after having curved around the crus cerebri. The middle cornu should now be laid open, by inserting the little finger into its cavity, and making it serve as a director for the scalpel in cutting away the side of the hemisphere, so as to expose it completely. The Superior boundary of the middle cornu is formed by the under surface of the thalamus opticus, upon which are the two pro- jections called corpus genie ulatum internum and externum ; and the inferior wall by the following parts :— Corpus fimbriatum, The Hippocampus major or cornu Ammonis, so called from its resemblance to a ram's horn, the famous crest of Jupiter Ammon, is a considerable projection from the inferior wall, and extends the whole length of the middle cornu. Its extremity is likened to the foot of an animal, from its presenting a number of knuckle-like elevations on the surface, and is named pes hippocampi. The hippocampus major is the internal surface of the convolution (gyrus fornicatus) of the lateral edge of the hemisphere, the convolution which has been previously described as lying on the corpus callosum and extending downwards to the base of the brain to terminate at the fissure of Sylvius. If it be cut across, the section will be seen to resemble the extremity of a convoluted scroll, consisting of alter- Hippocampus major, Pes hippocampi, Pes accessorius, Choroid plexus, Fascia dentata, Transverse fissure.455 FIFTH VENTRICLE.—FORNIX. nate layers of white and grey substance. The hippocampus major is continuous superiorly with the fornix and corpus callosum,, and derives its medullary layer from the corpus fimbriatum. The Pes accessorius (eminentia collaterals) is a swelling some- what resembling the hippocampus major, but smaller in size, and situated in the angular interval between it and the hippocampus minor. Like the latter, it is formed by the protrusion of one of the sulci of the convolutions. The Corpus fimbriatum (tenia hippocampi) is the narrow white band which is prolonged from the central cavity of the ventricle, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major. It is lost inferiorly in the hippocampus. Fascia dentata.—If the corpus fimbriatum be carefully raised, a narrow serrated band of grey substance, the margin of the grey substance of the middle lobe, will be seen beneath it; this is the fascia dentata. Beneath the corpus fimbriatum will be likewise seen the transverse fissure of the brain, which has been before de- scribed as extending from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, across to the same point on the opposite side. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the choroid plexus, and the latter obtains its supply of blood. The fissure is bounded on one side by the corpus fimbriatum, and on the other by the under surface of the thalamus opticus. The internal boundary of the lateral ventricle is the septum lucidum. This septum is thin, semi-transparent, and consists of two laminae of cerebral substance attached above to the under surface of the corpus callosum at its anterior part, and below to the fornix. Between the two layers is a narrow space, the fifth ventricle, which is lined by a proper membrane. The fifth ventricle may be shown, by snipping through the septum lucidum transversely with the scissors. The corpus callosum should now be cut across towards its an- terior extremity, and the two ends carefully dissected away. The anterior portion will be retained only by the septum lucidum, but the posterior will be found incorporated with the white layer beneath, which is the fornix. Fornix.—The fornix (arch) is a triangular lamina of white substance, broad behind, and extending into each lateral ventricle : narrow in front, where it terminates in two crura, which arch down- wards to the base of the brain. The two crura descend in a curved direction to the base of the brain, embedded in grey substance, in the lateral walls of the third ventricle, and lying directly behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain they make a sudden curve upon themselves and constitute the corpora albicantia, from which they may be traced upwards to their origin in the thalami optici. Opening transversely beneath these two crura, just as they are about to arch downwards, is the foramen of communication between the lateral and the third ventricle, the foramen of Monro ;FORNIX. 456 or foramen commune antcrius. The choroid plexuses communicate, and the veins of the corpora striata pass through this opening. The lateral thin edges of the fornix are continuous posteriorly with the concave border of the hippocampus major at each side, and form the narrow white band called corpus fimbriatum (posterior crus of the fornix). In the middle line the fornix is continuous Fij. 184.* with the corpus callosum, and at each side with the hippocampus major and minor.

THIRD VENTRICLE. 457 posterior part some transverse lines are seen passing between the diverging corpora fimbriata ; this appearance is termed the lyra (corpus psalloides), from a fancied resemblance to the strings of a harp. The fornix may now be removed by dividing it across anteriorly, and turning it backwards, at the same time separating its lateral connexions with the hippocampi. If the student examine its under surface, he will perceive the lyra above described. Beneath the fornix is the velum interpositum (tela choroidea), a duplicature of pia mater introduced into the interior of the brain, through the transverse fissure. The velum is continuous at each side with the choroid plexus, and contains in its inferior layer two large veins (the venie Galeni) which receive the blood from the corpora striata and choroid plexuses, and terminate posteriorly, after uniting into a single trunk, in the straight sinus. On the under surface of the velum interpositum are two fringe-like bodies, which project into the third ventricle. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle ; posteriorly these fringes enclose the pineal gland. The velum interpositum is coated with an epithe- lium inclentical with that of the choroid plexuses ; and around the pineal gland the areolar tissue is abundant and strong. If the velum interpositum be raised and turned back, an opera- tion to be conducted with care, particularly at its posterior part where it invests the pineal gland, the thalami optici and the cavity of the third ventricle will be brought into view. Thalami optici.—The thalami optici are two oblong, square- shaped bodies, of a white colour superficially, inserted between the two diverging portions of the corpora striata. In the middle line a fissure exists between them which is called the third ventricle. Posteriorly and inferiorly, they form the superior wall of the de- scending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and present two rounded elevations called corpus geniculatum externum and internum. The corpus geniculatum externum, the larger of the two, and of a greyish colour, is the principal origin of the optic nerve. Ante- riorly, the thalami are connected with the corpora albicantia by means of two white bands, which appear to originate in the white substance (tenia semicircularis) uniting the thalami to the corpora striata. Externally they are in relation with the corpora striata and hemispheres. In their interior the thalami are composed of white fibres mixed with grey substance. They are essentially the inferior ganglia of the cerebrum. Third ventricle.—The third ventricle is the fissure between the two thalami optici. It is bounded above by the under surface of the velum interpositum, from which are. suspended the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Its floor is formed by the grey substance of the anterior termination of the corpus callosum, called lamina cinerea, the tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus. Laterally it is bounded by the thalami optici; ante-THIRD VENTRICLE. 458 riorly by the anterior commissure and crura of the fornix; and posteriorly by the posterior commissure and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum.

Fig. 185* commissures, anterior, mid- dle, and posterior ; and be- tween these are two spaces, called foramen commune an- terius and foramen commune posterius. The Anterior commissure is a small rounded white cord, which enters the corpus striatum at either side, and reaches the substance of the hemispheres ; the middle, or soft commissure consists of grey substance, which is con- tinuous with the grey lining of the ventricle, it connects the adjacent sides of the tha- lami optici; the posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white cord, connecting the two tha- lami optici posteriorly. The space between the an- terior and middle commis- sure is called the foramen commune anterius, and is that to which Monro hasCORPORA QUADRIGEMINA. 459 given his name (foramen of Monro). It is the medium of com- munication between the two lateral and third ventricle, and trans- mits superiorly the choroid plexus and venae corporum striatorum. The foramen commune anterius is also termed, iter ad infun- dibidum, from leading downwards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum. The crura of the fornix are embedded in the lateral walls of the foramen commune, and are concealed from view in this situation by the layer of grey substance which lines the in- terior of the third ventricle. If the.crura be slightly separated, the anterior commissure will be seen immediately in front of them, crossing from one corpus striatum to the other. The space between the middle and posterior commissure is the foramen commune pos~ terius ; it is much shallower than the preceding, and is the origin of a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum, which leads backwards beneath the posterior commis- sure and through the base of the corpora quadrigeniina to the upper part of the fourth ventricle. Corpora quadrigemina.—The corpora quadrigemina, or optic lobes, are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and pos- terior commissure ; and beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. They form, indeed, at this point, the inferior boundary of the transverse fissure of the hemispheres, the fissure of Bichat. The anterior pair of these bodies, grey in colour, are named nates: the posterior pair, white and much smaller than the anterior, are termed testes. From the nates on each side may be traced a rounded process (brachium anterius) which passes obliquely outwards into the thalamus opticus ; and from the testis a similar but smaller process (brachium posterius) which has the same destination. The corpus geniculatum internum lies in the interval of these two pro- cesses where they enter the thalamus, and behind the brachium posterius is a prominent band (laqueus) which marks the course of the superior division of the fasciculus olivaris. The corpora quadri- gemina are perforated logitudinally through their base by the aqueduct of Sylvius ; they are covered in partly by the pia mater and partly by the velum interpositum, and the nates support the pineal gland. Pineal gland.—The pineal gland is a small reddish-grey body of a conical form (hence its synonym conarium), situated on the an- terior part of the nates, and invested by a duplicature of pia mater derived from the under part of the velum interpositum. The pineal gland, when pressed between the fingers, is found to contain a gritty matter* (acervulus) composed chemically of phosphate and carbonate * This gritty matter, the brain sand, consists of round, mulberry-shaped, opaque, concentrically striated granules; also, of angular, stalactiform, cla- vate or irregular bodies, having an uneven, botryoidal, scaly surface; also, of simple cylindrical rigid fibres branched or reticular; also, of fine particles. It is sometimes found in the choroid plexuses, and in the pia mater and arachnoid.460 FOURTH VENTRICLE. of lime, and phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, with some organic matter ; and is sometimes hollow in the interior. It is con- nected to the brain by means of two medullary cords called 'pedun- cles and a thin lamina derived from the posterior commissure ; the peduncles of the pineal gland are attached to the thalami optici, and may be traced along the upper and inner margin of those bodies to the crura of the fornix with which they become blended. From the close connexion subsisting between the pia mater and the* pineal gland, and the softness of texture of the latter, the gland is liable to be torn away in the removal of the pia mater. Behind the corpora quadrigemina is the cerebellum, and beneath the cerebellum the fourth ventricle. The student must therefore divide the cerebellum down to the fourth ventricle, and turn its lobes aside to examine that cavity. Fourth ventricle.—The fourth ventricle (sinus rhomboidalis) is the ventricle, of the cerebellum. It is situated on the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, is lozenge-shaped in its form, and bounded on each side by a thick cord passing between the cerebellum and corpora quadrigemina, called the pro- cessus e cerebello ad testes, and by the corpus restiforme. ' It is covered in behind by the cerebellum, and by a thin lamella of medullary substance, stretched between the two processus e cere- bello ad testes, termed the valve of Vieussens.* That portion of the cerebellum which forms the posterior boundary of the fourth ventricle presents four small prominences or lobules, and a thin layer of medullary substance, the velum medullare pos- terius. Of the lobules two are placed in the middle line, the nodidus and uvula, the former being before the latter ; the re- maining two are named amygdala?, or tonsils, and are situated one on either side of the uvula. They all project into the cavity of the fourth ventricle, and the velum medullare posterius is situated in front of them. The valve of Vieussens or velum medullare ante- rius is an extremely thin lamella of medullary substance, prolonged from the white matter of the cerebellum to the testes, and attached on each side to the processus e cerebello ad testes. This lamella is overlaid for a short distance by a thin, transversely grooved lobule of grey substance (linguetta laminosa) derived from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and its junction with the testes is strengthened by a narrow slip given off by the commissure of those bodies, the frcemdum veli medullaris anterioris. The anterior wall, or floor of the fourth ventricle is formed by two slightly con- vex bodies, fasciculi teretes (innominati), separated by a longitudinal groove which is continuous inferiorly with the posterior median fissure of the spinal cord. On these bodies the grey substance (fasciolee cinerea?) derived from the interior of the medulla is spread * Raymond Vieussens, a great discoverer in the anatomy of the brain and nervous system. His " Neurographia Universalis " was published at Lyons, in 1685.461 LINING MEMBRANE OF THE VENTRICLES. out, and at the lower part of the ventricle forms several eminences or nuclei, from which, according to Stilling, the eighth and ninth nerves, and probably also the fifth, take their^prigin. Higher up, the fasciculi teretes are crossed by several white strise (lineas trans- versa), the origin of the auditory nerves. Upon the lower part of the floor" of this ventricle is an impression resembling the point of a pen, and hence named calamus scriptorius; the lateral boun- daries of the calamus are the processus clavati of the posterior pyramids. Above, the fourth ventricle is bounded by the corpora quadrigemina and aqueduct of Sylvius ; and beloio by a layer of pia mater and arachnoid, called the valve of the arachnoid. Beneath this valve a communication exists between the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoidean space. Within the fourth ventricle, and lying against the uvula and tonsils, are two small vascular fringes formed by the pia mater, the choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle. LINING MEMBRANE OF THE* VENTRICLES. The lining membrane of the ventricles, ependyma ventriculorum, is a serous layer distinct from the araehnoid ; it lines the whole of the interior of the lateral ventricles, and is connected above and below with the attached border of the choroid plexus, so as to ex- clude all communication between the lateral ventricles and the exterior of the brain. From the lateral ventricles it is reflected through the foramen of Monro on each side into the third ventricle, which it invests throughout. From the third it is conducted into the fourth ventricle, through the iter a tertio ad quartum ventri- culum, and after lining its interior becomes continuous inferiorly with the subarachnoidean space of the spinal cord. The lining membrane of the ventricles is provided with a ciliated epithelium, and is the source of the secretion which moistens and lubricates their interior. The fifth ventricle has a separate lining membrane. The epithelium of the ependyma ventriculorum is for the most part bedded on the medullary substance, but where a substratum of areolar tissue exists, as in the walls of the lateral ventricles, and on the septum lucidum, and particularly where the sub-ependymic tissue is thickened, certain small bodies, corpuscula amylacea, are found as a pathological formation. These bodies resemble starch- granules, are round and biscuit-shaped, yellowish in colour, and marked by concentric strise. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum (figs. 184, 186, 188), seven times smaller than the cerebrum, is situated beneath the posterior cerebral lobes, being lodged in the posterior fossa of the base of the cranium, and protected from the superincumbent pressure of the cerebrum by the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is composed of grey and white sub-462 CEREBELLUM. stance, the former occupying the surface, the latter the interior, and its surface is formed of parallel lamellae separated by sulci, and here and there by deeper sulci. In form, the cerebellum is oblong and flattened, its greater diameter being from side to side, its two surfaces looking upwards and downwards, and its borders being anterior, posterior, and lateral. In consideration of its shape the cerebellum admits of a division into two hemispheres, into certain prominences termed processes and lobules, and into certain divisions of its sub- stance called lobes, formed upon the hemispheres by the deeper sulci above referred to. The two hemispheres are separated from each other on the upper surface of the cerebellum by a longitudinal ridge, which is termed the superior vermiform process, and which forms a commissure between them. On the anterior border of the organ there is a semilunar notch, incisura cerebelli anterior, which em- braces the corpora quadrigemina. On the posterior border there is another notch, incisura cerebelli posterior, which receives the upper part of the falx cerebelli: and on the under surface of the cere- bellum is a deep fissure corresponding with the medulla oblongata, and termed the vallecula (valley). Each hemisphere of the cerebellum is divided by means of a fissure (sulcus horizontalis) which runs along its free border, into an upper and a lower portion, and upon each of these portions certain lobes are marked out. Thus on the upper portion there are two such lobes separated by a sulcus, somewhat more strongly marked than the rest and extending deeper into the substance of the cerebellum ; they are the lobus superior anterior and lobus superior posterior. On the under portion of the hemisphere there are three such lobes, namely, lobus inferior anterior, medius, and posterior, and two additional ones of peculiar form, the lobus inferior internus or tonsil, and the flocculus. The tonsil (amygdala) is situated on the side of the vallecula, and projects into the fourth ventricle. The flocculus or pneumogastric lobule, long and slender, extends from the side of the vallecula around the corpus restiforme to the crus cerebelli lying behind the filaments of the eighth pair of nerves. The commissure between the two hemipheres is termed the worm (vermis), that portion of the worm which occupies the upper surface of the cerebellum as far back as the horizontal fissure being the pro- cessus vermiformis superior, and that which is lodged within the vallecula being the processus vermiformis inferior. The superior vermiform process is a prominent longitudinal ridge, extending from the incisura anterior to the incisura posterior. In imitation of the hemispheres, it is divided into lobes, of which three have received names, namely, the lobulus centralis, a small lobe situated in the incisura anterior ; the monticulus cerebelli, a longer lobe, having its peak and declivity ; and a small lobe near the incisura posterior, the commissura simplex. The lobes of the inferior vermiform process are four in number, namely, the commissura brevis, situated in the incisura posterior, below the horizontal fissure ; the pyramid,463 BASE OF THE BRAIN. a small obtusely-pointed eminence ; a larger prominence, the uvula, situated between the tonsils, and connected with them by means of a commissure ; and in front of the uvula, the nodulus. In front of the nodulus is a thin lamina of medullary substance consisting of a central and two lateral portions, the velum, medullare posterius (valvula Tarini), and between this velum and the nodulus and uvula is a deep fossa which is known as the svjallow*s nest (nidus hirundinis). The velum medullare anterius is the valve of Vieussens, described with the fourth ventricle; both these vela proceed from the same point in the roof of that ventricle, and separate from each other at an angle, the one passing obliquely forwards, the other obliquely backwards. When a vertical incision is made into the cerebellum, that appear- ance is seen which has been denominated arbor vital cerebelli ; the white substance in the centre of such a section resembles the trunk of a tree, from which branches are given off, and from the branches branchlets and leaves, the two latter being coated by a moderately thick and uniform layer of grey substance. If the incision be made somewhat nearer to the commissure than to the lateral border of the organ, a yellowish-grey dentated line, enclosing medullary substance traversed by the openings of numerous vessels, will be seen in the centre of the white substance. This is the ganglion of the cerebellum, the corpus rhomboideum or dentatum, from which the peduncles of the cerebellum proceed. The reddish-grey line is dense and horny in structure, and is the cut edge of a thin capsule, open towards the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum is associated with the rest of the encephalon by means of three pairs of rounded cords or peduncles, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior peduncles, or processus e cerebello ad testes, proceed from the cerebellum forwards and upwards to the testes, in which they are lost. They form the anterior part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle, and give attachment by their inner borders to the valve of Vieussens, which is stretched between them. At their junction with the testes they are crossed by the fourth pair of nerves. The middle peduncles, or crura cerebelli ad pontem, the largest of the three, issue from the cerebellum through the anterior extremity of the sulcus horizontalis, and are lost in the pons Varolii. The inferior penduncles, or crura ad medullam ob- longatam, are the corpora restiformia, which descend to the posterior part of the medulla oblongata, and form the inferior portion of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. BASE OP THE BRAIN. The student should now prepare to study the base of the brain : for this purpose the organ should be turned upon its incised surface; and if the dissection have hitherto been conducted with care, he will find the base uninjured. The arachnoid membrane, some parts of theBASE OF THE BRAIN. 464 pia mater, and the circle of Willis, must be carefully cleared away, in order to expose all the parts to be examined. These he will find arranged in the following order from before backwards :— The Longitudinal fissure is the space separating the two hemi- spheres ; it is continued downwards to the base of the brain, and divides the two anterior lobes. In this fissure the anterior cerebral arteries ascend towards the corpus callosum ; and if the two lobes be slightly drawn asunder, the anterior border (genu) of the corpus cal- losum will be seen descending to the base of the brain. Arrived at the base of the brain, the corpus callosum terminates by a concave border, which is prolonged to the commissure of the optic nerves by a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. The lamina cinerea is the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle. On each side of the lamina cinerea the corpus callosum is continued into the substantia perforata and crura cerebri, and, upon the latter, forms a narrow medullary band lying externally to, and slightly overlapping, the optic tract, the medulla innominata. On the under surface of each anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, is the olfactory nerve, with its bulb. The Fissure of Sylvius bounds the anterior lobe posteriorly, and separates it from the middle lobe; it lodges the middle cerebral artery. If this fissure be followed outwards, a small isolated cluster of five or six convolutions (gyri operti) will be observed ; these constitute the island of Reil. The island of Reil, together with the substantia perforata, forms the base of the corpus striatum. The Substantia perforata (locus perforatus anticus) is a triangular plane of white substance, situated at the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named perforata from being pierced by a number of openings for small arteries, which enter the brain in this situation to supply the grey substance of the corpus striatum. Passing backwards on each side beneath the edge of the middle lobe, is the commencement of the great transverse fissure, which extends beneath the hemisphere of one side to the same point on the opposite side. A probe passed into this fissm-e between the crus cerebri and middle lobe will enter the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle. The Optic commissure is situated on the middle line ; it is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The Tuber cinereum is an eminence of grey substance situated im- Longitudinal fissure, Olfactory nerves, Fissure of Sylvius, Substantia perforata Corpora albicantia, Locus perforatus, Crura cerebri ; Commencement of the transverse Optic commissure, [fissure, Tuber cinereum, Infundibulum ; Pons Varolii, Crura cerebelli, Medulla oblongata.465 BASE OF THE BRAIN. mediately behind the optic commissure, and in front of the corpora albicantia.

The infundibulum is hollow, enclosing a short csecal canal, which communicates with the cavity of the third ven- tricle ; and, below the termination of the canal, the conical process becomes connected with the pituitary gland. The infundibulum and tuber cinereum form part of the floor of the third ventricle. The Pituitary gland (hypophysis cerebri) is a small, flattened, reddish-grey body, situated in the sella turcica, and closely retained in that situation by the dura mater and arachnoid. It consists of two lobes, closely pressed together, the anterior lobe being the larger of the two and oblong in shape, the posterior round. Both lobes are connected with the iufundibulum, but the latter is so soft in texture as to be generally torn through in the removal of the brain. Indeed, for the purposes of the student, it is better to effect this separation with the knife, and leave the pituitary body in situ, to be examined with the base of the cranium. The Corpora albicantia (mammillaria, pisiformia, bulbi fornicis) are two white convex bodies, having the shape and size of peas, situated behind the tuber cinereum, and between the crura cerebri. They are a part of the crura of the fornix, which, after their origin from the thalami optici, descend (radix descendens) to the base of the brain, and making a sudden curve upon themselves previously to their ascent (radix ascendens) to the lateral ventricles, constitute the corpora albicantia. When divided by section, these bodies will be found to be composed of a capsule of white substance, containing grey matter, the grey matter of the two corpora being connected by means of a commissure. The Locus perforatus (posticus) is a layer of whitish-grey sub- stance, connected in front with the corpora albicantia, behind with the pons Varolii, and on each side with the crura cerebri, between which it is situated. It is perforated by several thick tufts of arte- ries, which are distributed to the thalami optici and third ventricle, of which latter it assists in forming the floor. It is also called the pons Tarini. The Crura cerebri (peduncles of the cerebrum) are two thick white cords, which issue from the anterior border of the pons Varolii, and diverge to enter the thalami optici and corpora striata. By their outer side the crura cerebri are continuous with the corpora quadrigemina, and, above, they constitute the lower boundary of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Within, they contain grey matter, which has a semilunar shape when the crus is divided transversely, and has been tei-med the locus niger. The third nerve will be observed to arise from the inner side of each crus, and the fourth nerves wind around their outer border from above. The Pons Varolii?* (protuberautia annularis, nodus encephali) is * Constant Varolius, Professor of Anatomy in Bologna: died in 1578. He dissected the brain in the course of its fibres, beginning from the medulla oblongata; a plan which has since been perfected^by Vieussens, and by Gall and Spurzheim. The work containing his mode of dissection, " De Resolu- tione Corporis Humani," was published after his death, in 1591.467 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. the broad transverse band of white fibres which arches like a bridge across the upper part of the medulla oblongata ; and, contracting on each side into a thick rounded cord, enters the substance of the cerebellum under the name of the crus cerebelli. There is a groove along its middle which lodges the basilar artery. The pons Varoli is the commissure of the cerebellum, and associates the two lateral lobes in their common function. Resting against the pons, near its posterior border, is the sixth pair of nerves. On the anterior border of the crus cerebelli, at each side, is the thick bundle of filaments belonging to the fifth nerve, and lying against its poste- rior border, the seventh pair of nerves. The upper surface of the pons forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata (bulbus rachidicus), is the upper enlarged portion of tbe spinal cord. It is somewhat conical in shape, and a little more than an inch in length, extending from the pons Varolii to a point corresponding with the upper border of the atlas. On the middle line, in front and behind, the medulla oblongata is marked by two vertical fissures, the anterior and posterior median fissures, which divide it superficially into two symmetrical lateral cords or columns ; whilst each lateral column is subdivided by shallow grooves into three smaller cords, namely, the corpora pyra- midalia, corpora olivaria, and corpora restiformia. The Corpora pyramidalia are two narrow convex cords, tapering slightly from above downwards, and situated one on either side of the anterior median fissure. At about an inch below the pons the corpora pyramidalia communicate across the fissure by a decussation of their fibres, and at their point of entrance into the pons are con- stricted into round cards. The fissure is somewhat enlarged by this constriction, and the enlarged space has received the name of foramen caecum (Vicq d'Azyr) of the medulla oblongata. The Corpora olivaria (named from some resemblance in shape to an olive) are two oblong, oval-shaped, convex bodies, of about the same breadth as the corpora pyramidalia, about half an inch in length, and somewhat larger above than below. The corpus olivare is situated * Section of the medulla oblongata made across the lower part of the cor- pora olivaria; after Arnold. 1,1. Corpora pyramidalia. 2. Anterior median fissure. 3.

Opposite hemisphere of the cerebellum.469 SPINAL CORD. other fibres which cross the corpus olivare obliquely, these are the fibrce arciformes. When examined by section the corpus olivare is found to be ganglion deeply embedded in the medulla oblongata, and meeting its fellow at the middle line behind the corpus pyra- midale. The ganglion of the corpus olivare (corpus dentatum, nucleus olivse), like that of the cerebellum, is a yellowish-grey den- tated capsule, open behind, and containing grey substance and transverse white fibres. The nervous filaments which spring from the groove on the anterior border of the corpus olivare, are those of the hypoglossal nerve ; and those on its posterior border are the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric. The Corpora restiformia (restis, a rope) comprehend the whole of the posterior half of each lateral column of the medulla oblongata. They are separated from the corpora olivaria by the grooves already spoken of; posteriorly they are divided from each other by the posterior median fissure and fourth ventricle, and superiorly they diverge and curve backwards to enter the cerebellum, and con- stitute its inferior peduncles. Along the posterior border of each corpus restiforme, and marked off from that body by a groove, is a narrow white cord, separated from its fellow by the posterior fissure. This pair of narrow cords are termed the posterior pyramids (fasciculi graciles). Each fasciculus forms an enlarge- ment (processus clavatus) at its upper end, and is then lost in the corresponding corpus restiforme. The processus clavati are the lateral boundaries of the nib of the calamus scriptorius. The corpus restiforme is crossed near its entrance into the cerebellum by the auditory nerve, the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and the pneumogastric lobule. The remaining portions of the medulla oblongata visible from the exterior, are the two slightly convex columns which enter into the formation of the floor of the fourth ventricle. These columns are the fasciculi teretes (innominati). SPINAL CORD. The dissection of the spinal cord requires that the spinal column should be opened throughout its entire length by sawing through the laminae of the vertebrae, close to the roots of the transverse processes, and raising the arches with a chisel ; the muscles of the back having been removed as a preliminary step. The Spinal column contains the spinal cord, or medulla spinalis ; the roots of the spinal nerves ; and the membranes of the cord, viz., the dura mater, arachnoid, pia mater, and membrana dentata. The Dura mater spinalis is a cylindrical sheath of fibrous mem- brane, identical in structure with the dura mater of the skull, and continuous with that membrane. At the margin of the occipital foramen it is closely adherent to the bone ; by its anterior surface it is attached to thejposterior common ligament, and below, by means470 SPINAL CORD. of its pointed extremity, to the coccyx. In the rest of its extent it is comparatively free, being connected, by a loose areolar tissue, to the walls of the spinal canal. In this areolar tissue there exists a quantity of reddish, oily, adipose substance, somewhat analogous to the marrow of long bones. On either side and below, the dura mater forms a sheath for each of the spinal nerves, to which it is closely adherent. Upon its inner surface it is smooth, being lined by the arachnoid ; and on its sides may be seen double openings for the two roots of each of the spinal nerves. The Arachnoid is a continuation of the serous membrane of the brain. It encloses the cord very loosely, being connected to it only by long slender filaments of areolar tissue, and by a longitudinal lamella which is attached to the posterior aspect of the cord. The areolar tissue is most abundant in the cervical region, and dimi- nishes in quantity from above downwards ; and the longitudinal lamella is complete only in the dorsal region. The arachnoid passes off from the cord on either side with the spinal nerves, to which it forms a sheath ; and is then reflected on the dura mater. A con- nexion exists in several places between the arachnoid and dura mater. The space between the arachnoid and the spinal cord is identical with that already described as existing between the same parts in the brain, the sub-araclinoidean space. It is occupied by a serous fluid, sufficient in quantity to expand the arachnoid, and fill completely the cavity of the dura mater. The sub-araclinoidean or cerebrospinal fluid keeps up a constant and gentle pressure on the entire surface of the brain and spinal cord, and yields with the greatest facility to the various movements of the cord, giving to those delicate structures the advantage of the principles so usefully applied by Dr. Arnott in the hydrostatic bed. The Pia mater is the immediate investment of the cord ; and, like the other membranes, is continuous with that of the brain. It is not, however, like the pia mater cerebri, a vascular membrane ; but is dense and fibrous in structure, and contains but few vessels. It invests the cord closely, and sends a duplicature into the anterior median fissure, and another, extremely delicate, into the posterior median fissure. It forms a sheath for each of the fasciculi of the nerves, and for the nerves themselves ; and, inferiorly, at the conical termination of the cord, is prolonged downwards as a slender liga- ment (filum terminate), which descends through the centre of the cauda equina, and is attached to the dura mater lining the canal of the coccyx. This attachment is a rudiment of the original extension of the spinal cord into the canal of the sacrum and coccyx. The pia mater has, distributed to it, a number of nervous plexuses. The Membrana dentata (ligamentum dentatum) is a thin process of pia mater sent off from each side of the cord throughout its entire length, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The number of serrations on each side is about twenty, the first being situated on a level with the occipital foramen, andSPINAL COSD. 471 having the vertebral artery and hypoglossal nerve passing in front and the spinal accessory nerve behind it, and the last opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra. Below this point the membrana dentata is lost in the filuin terminale of the pia mater. The use of this membrane is to maintain the position of the spinal cord in the midst of the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Spinal cord of the adult, somewhat less than eighteen inches in length, extends from the pons Varolii to opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a conical point, retained in position by the filum terminale ; in the child, at birth, the cone reaches the middle of the third lumbar vertebra, and in the embryo is prolonged as far as the coccyx. It presents a difference of diameter in different parts of its extent, and has three enlarge- ments. The uppermost of these is the medulla oblongata ; the next corresponds with the origin of the nerves destined to the upper extremities (brachial); and the lower enlargement (lumbar) is situ- ated near its termination, and corresponds with the attachment of the nerves which are intended for the supply of the lower limbs. The brachial enlargement is flattened from before backwards, and extends from the third cervical vertebra to the first dorsal; the lumbar enlargement is flattened from side to side, and is smaller than the brachial. . The spinal cord gives off near its termination that assemblage of nerves which has received the name of cauda equina ; the cauda equina being the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves elongated by the growth of the spine, the ganglia of the posterior roots being held in connexion with the intervertebral foramina through which the nerves pass. In form, the spinal cord is a flattened cylinder, and presents on its anterior surface a fissure, which extends into the cord to the depth of one-third its diameter. This is the anterior median fissure. If the sides of this fissure be gently separated, they will be seen to be connected at the bottom by a layer of medullary substance, the anterior white commissure. In the middle line behind and corre- sponding with the fissura anterior is the posterior median fissure, which exists as a fissure only in the upper part of the cervical and in the lumbar portion of the cord. Between these points its place is occupied by a series of perforations which transmit the blood- vessels to the grey substance. It extends more deeply into the cord than the anterior fissure, and reaches the grey substance of the interior. These two fissures divide the medulla spinalis into two lateral portions, which are connected to each other by the white commissure which forms the bottom of the anterior fissure, and by a commissure of grey matter situated behind the former. On either side of the posterior median fissure is a slight line which bounds on each side the posterior median columns. These columns are most apparent at the upper part of the cord, in the medulla oblongata, where they have received the name of posterior pyramids, or funi- culi graciles.472 CRANIAL NERVES. Two other lines are observed on the medulla, the anterior and posterior lateral sulci, corresponding with the attachment of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior lateral sulcus is a mere trace, marked only by the attachment of the filaments of the anterior roots ; the posterior lateral sulcus is some* what more evident. These fissures and sulci indicate a division of the spinal cord into three pairs of columns, namely, anterior, lateral, and posterior ; or, as they are frequently described, into antero- Fig. 189.* lateral and posterior. The anterior and part of the lateral columns are the columns'of motion ; the posterior part of the lateral, and the pos- terior columns, the columns of sensation. If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, its internal structure may be seen and examined. It will then appear to be com- posed of two hollow cylinders of white sub- stance placed side by side, and connected by a narrow white commissure. Each cylinder is filled with grey substance, which is connected by a commissure of the same matter (grey commissure). The form of the grey substance, as observed in the section, is that of two irregularly curved or crescentic lines joined by a transverse band. The extremities of the curved lines corresponding with the sulci of origin of the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, are termed cornua ; the anterior corny, is short and thick ; the posterior cornu, long and slender, reaches nearly to the surface of the sulcus lateralis posterior. CRANIAL NERVES. The pairs of cranial nerves are nine or twelve in number, ac- cording as the arrangement of "Willis or Soemmering is adopted ; the former has been generally used in this country ; but is greatly inferior to the latter, which is universally employed on the con- tinent. Willis numbered the pairs of nerves in correspondence with the openings in the base of the cranium, and included amongst them, as the tenth pair, the suboccipital or first cervical nerve, now considered as a spinal nerve. Soemmering, more properly, treats the facial and the auditory nerve as separate pairs, under the name of seventh and eighth ; the glossopharyngeal as the ninth pair; the pneumogastric the tenth; the spinal accessory the * Section of the spinal cord made between the third and fourth cervical nerves. 1.

Functionally or physiologically the cranial nerves admit of divi- sion into three groups, namely, nerves of special sense, nerves of motion, and compound nerves, that is, nerves which contain fibres both of sensation and motion. The nerves belonging to these groups are the following :—■ ( 1st. Olfactory. Special sense . . < 2nd. Optic. ( 7th. Auditory. 3rd. Motores oculorum. 4th. Pathetici. Motion . . . . -j 6th. Abducentes.

The fourth, facial, and three nerves of the eighth pair were con- sidered by Sir Charles Bell to form a system apart from the rest, and to be allied in the functions of expression and respiration. In consonance with this view he termed them respiratory nerves, and he gave to that part of the medulla oblongata from which they arise the name of respiratory tract. First pair. Olfactory.—The olfactory nerve arises by three roots; an inner or short root from the inner and posterior part of the anterior lobe close to the substantia perforata; a middle root from a papilla of grey matter (caruncula mamillaris), embedded in the anterior lobe, its white fibres being derived from the corpus striatum ; and an external or long root, which may be traced as a IOLFACTORY NERVE. 474 white streak along the fissure of Sylvius into the middle lobe, where it is continuous with the fibres of the anterior commissure and the exterior white substance of the thalamus opticus. The nervous cord formed by the union of the three roots is soft in tex- ture, prismoid in shape, and embedded in a sulcus between two convolutions on the under surface of each anterior lobe of the brain, lying between the pia mater aud arachnoid. As it passes forward Fig. 190.* it increases in breadth and swells at its extremity into an oblong mass of grey and white substance, the bulbus olfactorius, which * Olfactory nerve, with its distribution on the septum nasi.

From the under surface of the bulbus olfactorius are given off the nerves which pass through the cribriform foramina, and supply the mucous membrane of the nares ; they are arranged into three groups, an inner group, reddish in colour and soft, which spread out upon the septum narium ; an outer group, whiter and more firm, which de- scend through bony canals in the outer wall of the nares, and are distributed on the superior and middle turbinated bones ; and a middle group, which supply the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal fossae. Second pair. Optic.—The optic nerve, a nerve of large size, arises from the corpora geniculata on the posterior and inferior aspect of the thalamus opticus, from the thalamus itself, and from the nates. Proceeding from this origin it winds around the crus cerebri as a flattened band, under the name of tractus opticus, and joins with its fellow in front of the tuber cinereum to form the optic commissure (chiasma). The tractus opticus is united with the crus cerebri and tuber cinereum, and is covered in by the pia mater ; the commissure is also connected with the tuber cinereum, from which it receives fibres, and the nerve beyond the commissure diverges from its fellow, becomes rounded in form, and is enclosed in a sheath derived from the arachnoid. In passing through the optic foramen the optic nerve receives a sheath from the dura mater, which splits at this point into two layers ; one, which becomes the periosteum of the orbit; the other, the one in question, which forms a sheath for the nerve, and is lost in the sclerotic coat of the eyeball. After a short course within the orbit the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats and expands into the nervous membrane of the eyeball, the retina. Near the globe, the nerve is pierced by a small artery, arteria centralis retinse, which runs through the central axis of the nerve and reaches the internal sur- face of the retina, to which it distributes branches. The optic commissure rests on the processus olivaris of the sphe- noid bone; is bounded by the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum in front, by the substantia perforata at each side, and by the tuber cinereum behind. Within the commissure the innermost fibres of the optic nerves cross each other to pass to opposite eyes, the outer fibres continue their course uninterruptedly to the eye of the corre- sponding side ; some fibres pass in an arched direction from one nerve to the other behind, and others taking a similar course in front connect the two retinse. The neurilemma of the commissure, as well as that of the nerves, is formed by the pia mater. Third pair. Motores Oculorum.—The motor oculi, a nerve of moderate size, arises from the inner side of the crus cerebri, close to the pons Varolii, and passes forward between the posterior cere- bral and superior cerebellar artery. It pierces the dura mater im-476 MOTORES OCULORUM. mediately in front of the posterior clinoid process; descends obliquely in the external wall of the cavernous sinus ; and divides into two branches which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and between the two heads of the external rectus muscle. The superior branch ascends, and supplies the superior rectus and levator palpe- brae. The inferior sends a branch beneath the optic nerve to the Fig. 191 * internal rectus, another to the inferior rectus, and a long branch to the inferior oblique muscle. From the latter a short thick branch is given to the ophthalmic ganglion, forming its inferior root. The branches of the third nerve enter the muscles on their ocular side. The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced into the grey sub- * Isthmus encephali, showing thalamus opticus, corpora quadrigemina, pons Varolii, and medulla oblongata, viewed from the side. 1.

X In the cavernous sinus it receives one or two filaments from the carotid plexus, and one from the ophthalmic nerve. Fourth pair. Pathbtici (trochlearis).—The fourth is the smallest cerebral nerve ; it arises from the valve of Vieussens close to the testis, and winding around the crus cerebri to the extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, pierces the dura mater below the third nerve, and passes forward in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus to the sphenoidal fissure. In its course in the outer wall of the sinus it is situated at first below the motor oculi, but afterwards ascends and becomes the highest of the nerves enter- ing the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure. On entering the orbit the nerve crosses the levator palpebrse muscle near its origin, and is distributed on the orbital surface of the superior oblique or tro- chlearis muscle ; hence its synonym trochlearis. The fibres of origin of the two nerves communicate with each other forming a kind of commissure, while those of the deep origin of the nerve may be traced in two fasciculi to a grey nucleus in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius in front; and to a similar nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle behind. Branches.—While in the cavernous sinus the fourth nerve gives off a recurrent branch, and sends a branch of communication to the ophthalmic nerve ; the recurrent branch, consisting of sympathetic filaments derived from the carotid plexus, passes backwards be- tween the layers of the tentorium, and divides into two or three filaments, which are distributed to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. This recurrent nerve is sometimes a branch of the ophthalmic, and occasionally proceeds directly from the carotid plexus. Sometimes the communication with the ophthalmic takes place in the orbit, in which case the lachrymal nerve has the appear- ance of arising by two roots. Fifth pair. Trifacial (trigeminus).—The fifth nerve, the great sensitive nerve of the head and face, and the largest cranial nerve, is analogous to the spinal nerves in its origin by two roots from the anterior and posterior columns of the spinal cord, and in the exis- tence of a ganglion on the posterior root. It arises, or rather makes its appearance at the surface of the brain, on the anterior part of the lateral and constricted portion of the pons Varolii, and consists of a large and small fasciculus, separated by a narrow inter- space, the larger fasciculus being the posterior or sensitive root; the smaller one, the anterior or motor root. The sensitive root is * Mayo. t Solly.

The nerve then passes through an oval opening in the border of the tentorium, near the extremity of the petrous bone, and spreads out into a large semi-lunar ganglion, the Casserian. If the ganglion be turned over, it will be seen that the anterior root lies against its under surface without having any con- nexion with it, and may be followed onwards to the inferior maxil- lary nerve. The Casserian ganglion divides into three branches, ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. Following the nerve to its deep origin, the posterior root may be traced between the transverse layers of the pons Varolii, behind the corpus olivare, and between the corpus restiforme and fasciculus innominatus to the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ven- tricle ; the anterior root being lost among the longitudinal fibres prolonged upwards from the corpus pyramidale, or, according to Stilling, also pursuing its course to the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. When the posterior root is torn from its attachment a cone of medullary substance is left behind, occasioned by the deeper embrace of the filaments by the pia mater at the periphery than in the centre of the fasciculus. The Ophthalmic nerve is the nerve of sensation of the eyeball, lachrymal gland, mucous membrane of the eye and nose, integument of the forehead and nose, and muscles of the eyebrow and forehead. It arises from the upper part of the Casserian ganglion by a short trunk, about three quarters of an inch in length ; passes forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, lying externally to the other nerves, and divides into three branches. Previously to its division it receives several filaments from the carotid plexus, and gives off a small recurrent nerve, which passes backwards with the recurrent branch of the fourth nerve between the two layers of the tentorium to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. The Branches of the ophthalmic nerve are, the— Frontal, Lachrymal, Nasal. The Frontal nerve enters the orbit immediately to the outer side of the fourth nerve, and passing forwards, for some distance, upon the levator palpebrss muscle, divides into a supra-orbital and supra- trochlear branch. The supra-orbital branch, the proper continuation of the nerve, passes out of the orbit through the supra-orbital notch, in company with the supra-orbital artery, and after giving filaments to the upper eyelid, muscles of the forehead and pericranium, divides into two cutaneous branches, internal and external. The internal branch pierces the occipito-frontalis and is distributed to the integument as far as the summit of the head. The external branch of larger sizeOPHTHALMIC NERVE. 480 communicates with the facial nerve, and piercing the occipito-frontalis supplies the integument as far back as the occiput. The supra-trochlear branch passes inwards to the angle of the orbit, above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and is distri- buted, to the inner angle of the eye, root of the nose, and integument * Diagram showing the fifth pair of nerves with its branches. 1.

The superior branch passes over the gland which it supplies on the upper surface, and traversing a foramen in the malar bone, communicates with the subcutaneus malse and facial nerve. The inferior branch sup- plies the under surface of the gland, upper lid, and outer angle of the eye. The lachrymal nerve sometimes receives the branch of the fourth nerve destined for the ophthalmic, and appears to arise by two roots. The Nasal nerve (naso-ciliaris) enters the orbit between the two heads of the external rectus and between the two branches of the third nerve. It crosses the optic nerve in company with the oph- thalmic artery, and, passing over the internal rectus, enters the ante- rior ethmoidal foramen, by which it is conducted to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. It then passes through the slit-like opening by the side of the crista galli, and descends into the nose, where it divides into an internal and external branch. The internal branch is distributed to the mucous membrane; the external branch, passing outwards between the nasal bone^nd cartilage, supplies the integument of the exterior of the nose as far as its tip. The Branches of the nasal nerve are, ganglionic, ciliary, and infra-trochlear. The ganglionic branch, about half an inch in length and of small size, enters the upper angle of the ophthalmic ganglion, and consti- tutes its superior or long root. The long ciliary branches are two or three filaments given off from the nerve as it crosses the optic nerve. They pierce the sclerotic coat near the short ciliary nerves, and passing through the globe of the eye between the sclerotic and choroid, are distributed to the iris. The infra-trochlear branch is given off close to the anterior eth- moidal foramen. It passes forward along the upper border of the internal rectus to the inner angle of the eye, where it communicates with the supra-trochlear nerve, and is distributed to the lachrymal sac and inner angle of the orbit. The Superior maxillary nerve, larger than the preceding, is the nerve of sensation of the teeth of the upper jaw, the hard and soft palate, tonsils, antrum maxillare, and muscles and integument of the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip. Proceeding from the middle of the Casserian ganglion, it passes forward through the foramen rotundum, crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enters the canal in the floor of the orbit, along which it runs to the infra- orbital foramen. Emerging on the face, beneath the levator labii superioris muscle, it divides into a number of branches, wThich form a jjlexus with the facial nerve.483 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. The Branches of the superior maxillary nerve are divisible into three groups : namely, those given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa ; those given off in the infra-orbital canal; and those given off on the face. They may be thus arranged : ( Orbital, or temporo-malar, Spheno-maxillary fossa, •< Spheno-palatine, { Posterior dental. The Orbital or temporo-malar branch enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two branches, tem- poral and malar ; the temporal branch ascends along the outer wall of the orbit, and after receiving a branch from the lachrymal nerve, passes through a canal in the malar bone, and enters the temporal fossa ; it then pierces the temporal muscle and fascia, and is distri- buted to the integument of the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and anterior temporal nerve. In the temporal fossa it communicates with the deep temporal nerves. The malar, or inferior branch (subcutaneus malee) takes its course along the lower angle of the outer wall of the orbit, and emerges on the cheek through an opening in the malar bone, passing between the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. It communicates with branches of the infra-orbital and facial nerve. The Spheno-palatine branches, two in number, pass downwards to the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. The Posterior dental branches, two in number, pass downwards upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, where one enters a canal in the bone, and is distributed to the molar teeth and lining membrane of the antrum, and communicates with the anterior dental nerve ; while the other, lying externally to the bone, is distributed to the gums and buccinator muscle. The Middle and anterior dental branches descend to the corre- sponding teeth and gums ; the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. Previously to their distribution, the dental nerves form a plexus (superior maxillary plexus) in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone immediately above the alveolus. From this plexus filaments are given off which supply the pulps of the teeth, gums, mucous membrane of the floor of the nares, and palate. Some gangliform bodies have been described in connexion with this plexus, one being placed over the canine, another over the second molar tooth. The Muscular and cutaneous branches are the terminating fila- ments of the nerve ; they supply the muscles, integument, and Infra-orbital canal . . . On the face Middle dental, Anterior dental. i i 2484 INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. mucous membrane of the lower eyelid, cheek, nose, and upper lip, and form a plexus by their communications with the facial nerve. The Inferior maxillary nerve is a nerve both of sensation and motion, and is distributed to the teeth and gums of the lower jaw, to the tongue, which it supplies with the sense of taste, to the in- tegument of the temple, external ear, lower part of the face and lower lip, and to the muscles of mastication. It proceeds from the inferior angle of the Casserian ganglion, is the largest of the three divisions of the fifth nerve, and is increased in size by the anterior or motor root, which, passing behind the ganglion, unites with the inferior maxillary as it escapes through the foramen ovale. Emerg- ing at the foramen ovale the nerve divides into two trunks, external and internal, separated from each other by the external pterygoid muscle. The External division, into which may be traced nearly the whole of the motor root, immediately separates into five or six branches, distributed to the muscles of the temporo-maxillary region ; they are, masseteric, temporal, buccal, internal pterygoid, and external pterygoid. The Masseteric branch passing over the external pterygoid muscle, and behind the tendon of the temporal, crosses the sigmoid notch with the masseteric artery to the masseter muscle. It sends a small branch to the temporal muscle, and a filament to the temporo- maxillary articulation. The Deep temporal brandies, two in number, anterior and pos- terior, pass between the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle and the temporal bone to the temporal muscle. Two or three filaments from these nerves pierce the temporal fascia, and communicate with the lachrymal, subcutaneus malae, superficial temporal, and facial nerve. The Buccal branch is of large size, and pierces the lower fibres of the external pterygoid muscle at its anterior part. It sends a branch to the external pterygoid muscle, and is distributed to the buccinator, and mucous membrane and integument of the cheek, communicating with the facial nerve. The Internal pterygoid branch is a long and slender nerve which passes inwards to the internal pterygoid muscle, and gives filaments in its course to the tensor palati and tensor tympani. This nerve is remarkable for its connexion with the otic ganglion, to which it is closely adherent. The External pterygoid branch is commonly derived from the buccal nerve. The Internal division of the inferior maxillary nerve splits into three branches— Auriculotemporal, Inferior dental, Grustatory. The Auriculotemporal nerve originates by two roots, between which the arteria meningea media takes its course, and passes485 GUSTATORY NERVE. directly backwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw. It then ascends between that articulation and the meatus auris, and, escaping from beneath the parotid gland, divides into two temporal branches. While behind the temporo-maxillary articulation, it forms a kind of plexus, and sends off several branches. Its branches are, a small branch to the temporo-maxillary articu- lation ; two or three to the parotid gland ; two to the meatus auris, which enter the canal between the fibro-cartilage and processus auditorius ; two aux-icular branches to the pinna ; a communicating branch to the otic ganglion ; two communicating branches to the facial nerve, and the temporal branches. The auricular branches, superior and inferior, are distributed to the pinna above and below the meatus. The inferior branch communicates with the sympathetic. The branches which communicate with the facial nerve embrace the external carotid artery in their course. The temporal branches are anterior and posterior ; the anterior accompanies the anterior temporal artery, and supplies the integu- ment of the temporal region, communicating with branches of the facial, supra-orbital, subcutaneus malse and lachrymal nerve; the posterior is distributed to the upper part of the pinna, attrahens aurem muscle, and integument of the posterior part of the temple. The Inferior dental nerve, the largest of the three branches of the internal division of the inferior maxillary, passes downwards with the inferior dental artery, at first between the two pterygoid muscles, then between the internal lateral ligament and ramus of the lower jaw, to the dental foramen, next it runs along the canal in the inferior maxillary bone, distributing branches (inferior maxil- lary plexus) to the teeth and gums, and divides into two terminal branches, incisive and mental. The branches of the inferior dental nerve, besides those given to the teeth, are the mylo-hyoidean and the two terminal branches. The Mylo-hyoidean branch leaves the nerve just as it is about to enter the dental foramen ; it then pierces the insertion of the inter- nal lateral ligament, and descends along a groove in the bone to the inferior surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, to which, and to the anterior belly of the digastricus, it is distributed. The Incisive branch is continued forward to the symphysis of the jaw, to supply the incisor teeth. The Mental or labial branch emerges from the jaw at the mental foramen, beneath the depressor anguli oris, and divides into branches which supply the muscles and integument of the lower lip and chin, and communicate with the facial nerve. The Gustatory nerve descends between the two pterygoid muscles, and makes a gentle curve forwards to the side of the tongue, along which it takes its course to the tip. On the side ofABDUCENTES. 486 the tongue it is flattened, and gives off numerous branches, which are distributed to the mucous membrane and papillae. In the upper part of its course the gustatory nerve lies between the external pterygoid muscle and the pharynx, next between the two pterygoid muscles, then between the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, and between the stylo-glossus muscle and the submaxillary gland ; lastly, it runs along the side of the tongue, resting against the hyo-glossus muscle and crossing the duct of the submaxillary gland, and is covered in by the mylo-hyoideus and mucous membrane. The gustatory nerve, while between the pterygoid muscles, often receives a communicating branch from the inferior dental; lower down it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani, a small nerve which, arising from the facial in the aqueductus Fallopii, crosses the tympanum, and escapes from that cavity through the fissura Grlaseri. Having joined the gustatory nerve, the chorda tympani is continued downwards in its sheath to the submaxillary ganglion. One or two branches are given by the gustatory nerve to the sub- maxillary ganglion. • On the hyo-glossus muscle several branches of communication join with branches of the hypoglossal nerve, and others are sent to the sublingual gland, "Wharton's duct, and mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. Sixth pair. Abducentes.—The abducens nerve, about half the size of the motor oculi, arises by several filaments from the upper constricted part of the corpus pyramiclale, and by a few fibres from . the pons Varolii. Proceeding forwards from this origin, it lies * parallel with the basilar artery, and, piercing the dura mater on the clivus Blumenbachii of the sphenoid bone, ascends between the two layers of that membrane to the cavernous sinus. It then runs forward through the sinus below the level of the other nerves, and resting against the internal carotid artery, to the sphenoidal fissure. Entering the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure it passes between the two heads of the external rectus, and is distributed to that muscle. At the sphenoidal fissure it lies upon the ophthal- mic vein, from which it is separated by a lamina of dura mater; and in the cavernous sinus is joined by several filaments from the carotid plexus. Mayo traced the deep origin of this nerve between the fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia to the posterior part of the medulla ob- longata ; and it appears to arise from the grey substance of the fourth ventricle. Seventh pair.—The seventh pair of nerves, of Willis, consists of two nervous cords which lie side by side on the posterior border487 FACIAL NERVE. of the cms cerebelli. The smaller and most internal of these, and at the same time the most dense in texture, is the facial nerve or portio dura. The external nerve, which is soft and pulpy, and often grooved by contact with the preceding, is the auditory nerve or portio mollis. * Facial nerve ; portio dura; seventh pair of Soemmering.—The facial nerve, the motor nerve of the face, arises from the upper part of the groove between the corpus olivare and corpus restiforme close to, and by a few fibres from, the pons Varolii; its deep origin being traced through the corpus restiforme to the side of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The nerve passes forward, resting on the crus cere- belli, and comes into relation with the auditory nerve, with which it enters the meatus auditorius internus, lying at first to the inner side of, and then upon that nerve. At the bottom of the meatus, the facial nerve enters the aqueductus Fallopii, and takes its course forwards to the hiatus Fallopii, in the anterior wall of the petrous bone, Mi ere it forms a gaugliform swelling (intuinescentia gangliformis, ganglion geniculare), and receives the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. It then curves backwards towards the tympanum, and descends in the inner wall of that cavity to the stylo-mastoid foramen. Emerg- ing at the stylo-mastoid foramen, it passes forwards within the parotid gland, crossing the external carotid artery, to the ramus of the lower jaw, were it splits into two trunks, temporo-facial and cervico-facial. These trunks divide into numerous branches, which escape from the anterior border of the parotid gland, and are dis- tributed in a radiated manner over the side of the face, from the temple to below the lower jaw ; on the masseter muscle the branches communicate and form loops, and the whole arrangement over the side of the face has been termed pes anserinus. In the meatus auditorius, the facial nerve communicates with the auditory nerve by one or two "filaments ; the intumescentia gangli- formis receives the nervus petrosus superficialis major and minor, and sends a twig back to the auditory nerve ; behind the tympanum, the nerve receives one or two twigs from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric; at its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen it re- ceives a twig from the glossopharyngeal, and in the parotid gland one or two large branches from the auriculo-temporal nerve. Besides these, the facial nerve has numerous peripheral communications, with the branches of the fifth nerve on the face, with the cervical * A third nerve of small size, portio intermedia of Wrisberg, is brought into view by separating these two cords. The researches of Morganti render it probable that the portio intermedia is connected, at its origin in the corpus restiforme, with the auditory nerve; that it is the posterior or sensitive root of the facial; that the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial is the ganglion of this root; that it bestows the principal part of the sensitive function on the facial; and that the chorda tympani is partly derived from the intume- scentia gangliformis. 4TEMPORO-FACIAL NERVES. 488 nerves in the parotid gland and on the neck, and with the sympa- thetic. The numerous communications of the facial nerve have obtained for it the designation of nervus sympatheticus minor. The Branches of the facial nerve are— Within the aqueductus (Tympanic, Fallopii After emerging at the stylo-mastoid foramen, On the face .... ( Chorda tympani. ( Posterior auricular, < Stylo-hyoid, ( Digastric. I Teinporo-facial, (Cervico-facial. The Tympanic Iranch is a small filament given off by the facial while in the petrous bone, and distributed to the stapedius muscle. The Chorda tympani quits the facial immediately above the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends by a distinct canal to the upper part of the posterior wall of the tympanum, where it enters that cavity through an opening situated between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested by mucous membrane, It then crosses the tympanum between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus to its anterior inferior angle, and escapes through an opening in the fissura Grlaseri, to join the gustatory nerve at an acute angle between the two pterygoid muscles. Enclosed in the sheath of the gustatory nerve, it descends to the submaxillary gland, where it enters the submaxil- lary ganglion. The Posterior auricular branch ascends behind the ear, between the meatus and mastoid process, and divides into an anterior or auricular, and a posterior or occipital, branch. The auricular branch receives a filament of communication from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve, and distributes filaments to the retrahens aurem muscle and pinna. The occipital branch communi- cates with the auricularis magnus and occipitalis minor, and is dis- tributed to the occipital portion of the occipito-frontalis. The Stylo-hyoid branch is distributed to the stylo-hyoid muscle, and communicates with the sympathetic plexus of the external carotid artery. The Digastric branch supplies the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, and communicates with the glossopharyngeal and pneumo- gastric nerve. The Tempoko-pacial division, while in the parotid gland, sends a branch of communication along the carotid artery to the auriculo- temporal nerve, and divides into temporal, malar, and infra-orbital branches. The Temporal branches ascending upon the temporal region supply the attrahens aurem, occipito-frontalis, and orbicularis palpebrarum;FACIAL NERVE. 489 and communicate with the supra-orbital nerve and temporal branch of the superior maxillary. The Malar branches cross the malar bone to the outer angle of the eye, and supply the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, and eyelids. They communicate with the subcutaneus malse branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and with branches of the ophthalmic nerve in the eyelids. * Distribution of the facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus. 1.

The Infra-orbital branches cross the masseter muscle, and are distributed to the buccinator, elevator muscles of the upper lip, and orbicularis oris. They communicate with the terminal branches of the infra-orbital nerve, infra-trochlear, and nasal nerve. Two or more of these branches are found by the side of Stenon's duct. The Cervico-pacial division, smaller than the temporo-facial, communicates in the parotid gland with the auricularis magnus nerve, and divides into branches which admit of arrangement into three sets ; bucc J, supra-maxillary, and infra-maxillary. The Buccal branches pass forward across the masseter muscle towards the mouth, and distribute branches to the orbicularis oris and buccinator. They communicate with branches of the tem- poro-facial, and with the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The Supra-maxillary branches are destined to the muscles of the lower lip, and take their course along the body of the lower jaw. Beneath the depressor anguli oris, they have a plexiform communi- cation with the inferior dental nerve. The Infra-maxillary branches (subcutanei colli) take their course below the lower jaw, pierce the deep cervical fascia, and are dis- tributed to the platysma; communicating with the superficialis colli nerve. Auditory nerve ; portio mollis ; eighth pair of Soemmering.— The auditory nerve takes its origin in the lineee transversa (stria? medullares) of the anterior wall or floor of the fourth ventricle, ana winds around the corpus restiforme, from which it receives fibres, to the posterior border of the crus cerebelli. It then passes forward on the crus cerebelli in company with the facial nerve, which lies in a groove on its superior surface, enters the meatus auditorius internus, and at the bottom of the meatus divides into two branches, cochlear and vestibular. The auditory nerve is soft and pulpy in texture, and receives in the meatus auditorius several filaments from the facial nerve. Eighth pair of Willis ; ninth, tenth, and eleventh pairs of Soemmering ; consists of three nerves, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo- gastric, and spinal accessory. G-losso-pharyngeal nerve.—The glosso-pharyngeal nerve, as its name implies, is the nerve of sensation of the mucous membrane of the tongue and pharynx, but it also gives branches to some of the muscles of these organs. It arises by five or six filaments from the groove between the corpus olivare and restiforme, or rather from the anterior border of the latter, and escapes from the skull at the innermost extremity of the jugular foramen through a distinct opening in the dura mater, lying anteriorly to the sheath of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerve, and internally to the jugular vein. It then passes forward between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and crosses the artery to reach the poste-GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL NERVE. 491 rior border of the stylo-pharyngeus. Following the posterior border of this muscle for a short distance, it next passes across it and the middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus muscle, to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the tongue, pharynx, and tonsil. While in the jugular fossa, the nerve presents two gangliform swellings ; one superior, the ganglion jugulare (Muller), of small size, and involving only the posterior fibres of the nerve ; the other inferior, nearly half an inch below the preceding, of larger size, and occupying the whole diameter of the nerve, the ganglion, petrosum or ganglion of Andersch.* The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme to the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve are branches of communication and branches of distribution. The branches of communication proceed chiefly from the gan- glion of Andersch ; they are, one to join the auricular branch of the pneumogastric ; one to the ganglion of the pneumogastric ; one to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one, which arises j below the ganglion and pierces the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, to join the facial nerve. The Branches of distribution are— The Tympanic branch (Jacobson's nerve) proceeds from the ganglion of Andersch, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately above the ganglion ; it enters a small bony canal in the jugular fossa (page 35), and divides into six branches, which are distri- buted on the inner wall of the tympanum, and establish a plexiform communication (tympanic plexus) with the sympathetic and fifth pair of nerves. The branches of distribution supply the fenestra rotunda, fenestra ovalis, and Eustachian tube : those of communi- cation join the carotid plexus in the carotid canal, the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve, and the otic ganglion. The Carotid branches are several filaments which follow the trunk of the internal carotid artery, and communicate with the nervi molles of the sympathetic. The Muscular branch divides into filaments, which are distri- buted to the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo- pharyngeus, and constrictor muscles. The Pharyngeal branches are two or three filaments which are distributed to the pharynx and unite with the pharyngeal branches Tympanic, Carotid, Muscular, Pharyngeal, Tonsillitic, Lingual. * Charles Samuel Andersch. "Tractatus Anatomico-Ph)siologicus de Nervis corporis Humani Aliquibus, 1797."492 PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerve to form the pharyngeal plexus. The Tonsillitic branches proceed from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, near its termination ; they form a plexus (circulus tonsil- laris) around the base of the tonsil, from which numerous filaments are given off to the mucous membrane of the fauces and soft palate. These filaments communicate with the descending palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. The Lingual branches enter the substance of the tongue beneath thehyo-glossus and stylo-glossus muscle, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the side and base of the tongue, and to the epiglottis and fauces. Pneumogastric or Vagus nerve ; par vagum; tenth pair of Soem- mering.—The pneumogastric is the nerve of the respiratory organs and upper part of the alimentary canal, supplying branches to the larynx, trachea, lungs, pharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, and also giving branches to the heart. It arises by ten or fifteen filaments from the groove between the corpus olivare and corpus restiforme, or rather from the anterior border of the latter, immediately below the glosso-pharyngeal, and passes out of the skull through the inner extremity of the jugular foramen, enclosed in a sheath of dura mater common to it and the spinal accessory. The nerve then takes its course down the side of the neck, lying at first between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and lower down behind and between that vein and the common carotid artery and enclosed in the same sheath. At the root of the neck the course of the nerve on the two sides is different. The right nerve enters the chest by passing between the subclavian artery and vein, and de- scends by the side of the trachea to the posterior part of the root of the right lung ; it then proceeds as a double cord along the posterior aspect of the oesophagus to the corresponding side of the stomach; the two cords reuniting at the lower part of the oesophagus. The left nerve enters the chest between the left common carotid and subclavian artery lying behind the left vena innominata; it then crosses the arch of the aorta, and reaches the posterior part of the root of the left lung, whence it descends, by one or two cords, along the anterior aspect of the oesophagus to the front part of the stomach. In the jugular foramen, the pneumogastric nerve presents a small round ganglion, the superior or jugular ganglion ; and immediately at its exit a gangliform swelling, nearly an inch in length, the inferior ganglion (plexus gangliformis). The fibres of origin of the pneumogastric nerve, like those of the glosso-pharyngeal, maybe traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme to the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The branches of the pneumogastric nerve are branches of commu- nication and branches of distribution. The branches of communication proceed from the ganglia ; from493 rNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. the superior ganglion one or two branches pass to the spinal acces- sory ; one or two to the superior ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one to the inferior ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. From the inferior ganglion there pass on0 branches to the hypoglossal; branches to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and branches to the loop between the first and second cervical nerve. The Branches of distribution are— Auricular, Pulmonary anterior, Pharyngeal, Pulmonary posterior, Inferior or recurrent laryngeal, The Auricular nerve is given off from the lower part of the jugular ganglion, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately below it, and receives immediately after its origin a small branch of com- munication from the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes outwards behind the jugular vein, and at the outer side of that vessel enters a small canal (page 35), in the petrous portion of the temporal bone near the stylo-mastoid foramen. Guided by that canal it reaches the descending part of the aqueductus Fallopii and joins the facial nerve. In the aqueductus Fallopii the auricular nerve gives off two small filaments, one of which communicates with the pos- terior auricular branch of the facial, while the other is distributed ( to the pinna. The Pharyngeal nerve arises from the upper part of the superior ganglion and crosses behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, upon which it forms the pharyn- geal plexus assisted by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and sympathetic. The pharyngeal plexus is distributed to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The Superior laryngeal nerve arises from the inferior ganglion and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the thyro-hyoidean membrane, through which it passes with the supe- rior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx and arytenoideus muscle. On the latter, and behind the cricoid cartilage, it communicates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Behind the internal carotid it gives off the external laryn- geal branch, which sends a twig to the pharyngeal plexus, and then descends to supply the inferior constrictor, crico-thyroid muscle and thyroid gland. This branch communicates inferiorly with the re- current laryngeal and sympathetic nerve. The Cardiac branches, two or three in number, arise from the upper and lower part of the cervical portion of the nerve. Those from above communicate with cardiac branches of the sympathetic. One large branch {inferior cardiac) is given off just before the nerve enters the chest; on the right this branch descends by the Superior laryngeal, Cardiac, (Esophageal, Gastric.INFERIOR LARYNGEAL NERVE. 494 side of the arteria innominata to tl left it passes in front of the arch e deep cardiac plexus; on the of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. One or two cardiac branches also proceed from the thoracic portion of the right pneumogastric nerve. The Inferior laryngeal, or recurrent laryngeal nerve, curves around the subclavian artery on the right, and the arch of the aorta on the left side. It ascends in the groove between the trachea and oeso- phagus, and piercing the lower fibres of the inferior constrictor muscle enters the larynx close to the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid carti- lage. It is distributed to all the muscles of the larynx, with the exception of the crico- thyroid, and communicates on the arytenoideus muscle with the superior laryngeal * * Origin and distribution of the glosso - pharyngeal, pneumogas- tric, and spinal accessory nerve. 1, 3, 4.

As it curves around the subclavian artery and aorta it gives branches (cardiac) to the heart and root of the lungs ; and as it ascends the neck it distributes filaments to the oesophagus and trachea, and communicates with the extei-nal laryngeal nerve and sympathetic. The Anterior pulmonary branches, two or three in number, are distributed upon the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs, form- ing, with branches from the cardiac plexuses, the anterior pul- monary plexus. The Posterior pulmonary branches, more numerous and larger than the anterior, are distributed on the postei-ior aspect of the root of the lungs ; they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and form the posterior pulmo- nary plexus. (Esophageal branches are given off by the pneumogastric nerves above the root of the lungs ; below that point, the trunks of the nerves, divided into several cords, form a plexus around the oeso- phagus, the right and left nerves communicating with each other. This plexus accompanies the oesophagus to the stomach, and is the esophageal plexus (plexus guise). The Gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the pneumo- gastric nerves ; they are spread out upon the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, and are likewise distributed to the omentum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder. The branches of the anterior aspect of the stomach proceed from the left nerve and com- municate with the hepatic plexus in the lesser omentum ; those of the posterior aspect are derived from the right nerve and communi- cate with the solar plexus. Spinal accessory nerve ; eleventh pair of Soemmering.—The spinal accessory, a nerve of motion, arises by several filaments from the side of the spinal cord as low down as the fifth or sixth cervical nerve, and ascends behind the ligamentum dentatum, and between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, to the foramen lacerum posterius. It communicates in its course with the posterior root of the first cervical nerve, and, entering the foramen lacerum, becomes applied against the posterior aspect of the superior ganglion of the pneumogastric, being contained in the same sheath of dura mater. The nerve then passes outwards and downwards, behind and sometimes in front of the internal jugular vein, to the upper and under part of the sterno-mastoid, pierces that muscle obliquely, and descends across the posterior triangle of the neck to the under surface of the trapezius to which it is distributed, its branches being continued downwards to near the lower border of the muscle. The Branches of communication of the spinal accessory are one or two small branches from the superior ganglion of the pneumo- gastric, and a large branch which joins the pneumogastric between the two ganglia.496 SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. Its Branches of distribution are muscular branches to the sterno- mastoid and trapezius. In the substance of the sterno-mastoid it communicates with branches of the cervical plexus, and in the pos- terior triangular space with the third and fourth cervical nerve. * Anatomy of the side of the neck, showing- the nerves of the tongue. 1.

The deep origin of the spinal accessory may he traced into the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Ninth pair of Willis ; twelfth pair of Soemmering. Hypo- glossal nerve ; lingual. — The hypoglossal is a nerve of motion, distributed to all the muscles of the tongue, most of those attached to the os hyoides, and the sterno-thyroid. It arises from the groove between the corpus pyramidale and corpus olivare by ten or fifteen filaments, which are collected into two bundles, and escape from the cranium through the anterior condyloid foramen. At its exit from the cranium, the nerve lies behind the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, then passing forward between the artery and vein it descends to a point parallel with the angle of the lower jaw. It next curves forward around the occipital artery, with which it forms a loop, and crossing the external carotid and lower part of the hyo-glossus muscle to the genio-hyo-glossus, sends filaments on- wards with the anterior fibres of that muscle as far as the tip of the tongue. While resting on the hyo-glossus muscle it is flattened, and beneath the mylo-hyoideus communicates with the gustatory nerve. At its origin, the hypoglossal nerve sometimes communicates with the posterior root of the first cervical nerve. Its deep origin may be traced to one of the nuclei of grey substance, in the floor of the fourth ventricle, where it decussates with its fellow of the opposite side. The branches of the hypoglossal nerve are, branches of communi- cation and branches of distribution. The Branches of communication of the hypoglossal nerve are, several to the pneumogastric, with which nerve it is closely united ; one or two with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one or two with the loop between the first and second cervical nerve. The Branches of distribution are— Descendens noni, Thyro-hyoidean, Muscular. The Descendens noni is a long and slender nerve, which quits the hypoglossal just as it is about to form its arch around the occipital artery, and descends on the sheath of the carotid vessels. Just below the middle of the neck it forms a loop with a long branch (communicans noni) derived from the second and third cervical nerve. From the convexity of this loop branches are sent to the sterno-hyoideus, sterno-thyroideus, and both bellies of the omo- hyoideus ; sometimes also a twig is given off to the cardiac plexus, and occasionally one to the phrenic nerve. If the descendens noni K K493 SPINAL NERVES. be traced to its origin, it will be found to be composed of a branch from the hypoglossal, and one from the first and second cervical nerve ; occasionally it receives also a filament from the pneumo- gastric. The Thyro-hyoidean nerve is a small branch, distributed to the thyro-hyoideus muscle. It is given off by the trunk of the hypo- glossal near the posterior border of the hyo-glossus, and descends obliquely over the great cornu of the os hyoides. The Muscular branches are given off where the nerve is covered in by the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and rests on the hyo-glossus; several large branches take their course across the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus to reach the substance of the tongue. Moreover, on the hyo-glossus muscle, the branches of the hypoglossal nerve communicate with those of the gustatory nerve. SPINAL NERVES. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, each arising by two roots, an anterior or motor root, and a posterior or sensitive root. The anterior roots pro- ceed from the anterior late- ral sulcus, which marks the division of the anterior from the middle column of the spinal cord, and gradu- ally approach towards the anterior median fissure as they descend. The posterior roots, more regular than the anterior, proceed from the posterior lateral sulcus ; they are larger, and the filaments of origin more numerous than those of the anterior roots ; and in the intervertebral * Part of the cervical portion of trie spinal cord, viewed on its posterior aspect; showing its membranes and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 1, 1.

The first cervical nerve forms an exception to these characters; its pos- terior root is smaller than the anterior ; it often joins, in whole or in part, the spinal accessory nerve, and sometimes the hypo- glossal ; it has frequently no ganglion, and when the ganglion exists, it is often situated within the dura mater, the latter being the usual position of the ganglia of the last two pairs of spinal nerves. After the formation of a ganglion, the two roots unite, and con- stitute a spinal nerve, which escapes through the intervertebral foramen, and separates into an anterior cord for the supply of the front aspect of the body, and a posterior cord for the posterior aspect. In the first cervical, last sacral, and coccygeal nerve this division takes place within the dura mater ; and in the upper four sacral nerves, externally to that cavity, but within the sacral canal. The anterior cords, with the exception of the first two cervical nerves, are larger than the posterior ; an arrangement which is proportioned to the larger extent of surface they are required to supply. The1 Spinal nerves are classed as follows :— Cervical 8 pairs Dorsal 12 ,, Lumbar 5 ,, Sacral 5 ,, Coccygeal 1 The cervical nerves pass off transversely from the spinal cord ; the dorsal are oblique in direction ; the lumbar and sacral, vertical; the latter form the large assemblage of nerves, at the termination of the cord, called cauda equina. The cauda equina occupies the lower third of the spinal canal. CERVICAL NERVES. The cervical nerves increase in size from . above downwards; the first (suboccipital) passes out of the spinal canal between the occipital bone and atlas ; the second between the posterior ring of the atlas and the lamina of the axis ; and the last between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebra. Each nerve, at its escape from the intervertebral foramen, divides into an anterior and a pos- terior cord. The anterior cords of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus; the posterior cords, the posterior cervical plexus. The anterior cords of the four inferior cervical together with the first dorsal form the brachial plexus. Anterior cervical nerves.—The anterior cord of the first cer- vical or suboccipital nerve escapes from the vertebral canal through kk2CERVICAL PLEXUS. 500 the groove on the posterior arch of the atlas, which supports the vertebral artery, lying beneath that vessel. It descends in front of the transverse process of the atlas, sends twigs to the rectus lateralis and rectus anticus minor, and forms an anastomotic loop by communicating with an ascending branch of the second nerve. Branches from this loop communicate with the pneumogasfcric nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and first cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The anterior cord of the second cervical nerve, at its exit from the intervertebral foramen between the atlas and axis, gives twigs to the rectus anticus major, scalenus medius, and levator anguli scapulae, and divides into three branches : ascending branch, which com- pletes the arch of communication with the first nerve ; and two descending branches, which form loops with corresponding branches of the third nerve. The anterior cord of the third cervical nerve, double the size of the preceding, divides at its exit from the intervertebral foramen into several branches, some of which are distributed to the rectus major, longus colli, and scalenus medius, while others communicate and form loops and anastomoses with the second and fourth nerve. The anterior cord of the fourth cervical nerve, equal in size with the preceding, sends twigs to the rectus major, longus colli, and levator anguli scapulae, communicates by anastomosis with the third, and sends a small branch downwards to the fifth nerve. Its principal branches pass downwards and outwards across the posterior triangle of the neck, towards the clavicle and acromion. The anterior cords of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves will be described with the brachial plexus, of which they form a part. Cervical plexus.—The cervical plexus is constituted by the loops of communication and anastomoses which take place between the anterior cords of the first four cervical nerves. The plexus rests on the levator anguli scapulas, posterior and middle scalenus, and splenius colli muscle, and is covered in by the sterno-mastoid and platysma. The Branches of the cervical plexus may be arranged into three groups, superficial ascending, superficial descending, and deep :— Superficial ISuperficial:s colli, Auricularis magnus, Occipitalis minor. Descending, j Communicating branches, Deep501 CEEVICAL PLEXUS. The Superficialis colli is formed by communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid and crosses obliquely behind the ex- ternal jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, where it pierces the deep cervical fascia and divides into an ascending and a descending branch. The ascending branch passes upwards to the submaxillary region, and divides into four or five filaments, some of which pierce the platysuia myoides, and supply the integument as high as the chin and lower part of the face ; while others form a plexus with the inframaxillary branches of the facial nerve beneath the platysma. One or two filaments from this branch accompany the external jugular vein. The descending branch pierces the platysma and is distributed to the integument of the front of the neck as far downwards as the sternum. The Auricularis magnus, the largest of the three ascending branches of the cervical plexus, also proceeds from the second and third cervical nerve ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends upon that muscle, lying parallel with the external jugular vein, to the parotid gland, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch is distributed to the integument over the parotid gland, and to the gland itself, communicating with the facial nerve. The posterior branch ascends behind the ear where it divides into auricular branches, supplying the pinna ; and a mastoid branch which communicates with the posterior auricular branch of the facial and is distributed to the integument behind the ear. The auricular branches communicate with the auricular offsets of the facial nerve, pneumogastric nerve, and occipitalis minor. The Occipitalis minor arises from the second cervical nerve ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid above the preceding, and ascends upon that muscle, parallel with its posterior border, to the lateral and posterior aspect of the cranium. It is distributed to the integument, to the occipital portion of the occipito-frontalis and attollens aurem, and communicates with the occipitalis major, auricularis magnus, and posterior auricular branch of the facial. Superficial descending branches.—The Acr'omiales and Clavicu- lares are two or three large nerves which proceed from the fourth cervical nerve, and pass downwards in the posterior triangle of the neck ; they pierce the deep fascia, and, crossing the clavicle, are distributed to the integument of the front of the chest from the sternum to the acromion : hence their designation, clavicidares and acromiales. The most anterior of the branches is named sternal, from its destination, and the outermost branch passes over the clavicular attachment of the trapezius, to reach the shoulder.POSTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES. 502 Deep Branches.—The communicating brandies are filaments which arise from the loop hetween the first and second cervical nerve, and pass inwards to communicate with the sympathetic, pneumo- gastric, and hypoglossal nerve. The first three cervical nerves send branches to the first cervical ganglion ; the fourth sends a branch to the trunk of the sympathetic, or to the middle cervical ganglion. From the second cervical nerve a large branch is given off, which joins the spinal accessory nerve. The Communicans noni is a long and slender branch of communi- cation between the cervical plexus and descendens noni ; it is formed by filaments from the second and third cervical nerve ; descends at the outer side of the internal jugular vein, and forms a loop with the descendens noni over the sheath of the carotid vessels. The Muscular branches of the cervical plexus are distributed to the muscles of the front of the vertebral column and side of the neck. From the loop, between the first and second nerve, branches are given to the anterior recti; from the second cervical nerve a branch proceeds to the sterno-mastoid ; from the third and fourth nerve branches are distributed to the trapezius, levator anguli scapula?, scalenus medius, and scalenus posticus. The branch to the trapezius communicates with the spinal accessory nerve. The Phrenic nerve (internal respiratory of Bell) is formed by the union of filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerve, and one from the sympathetic. It descends to the root of the neck, resting on the scalenus anticus muscle, crosses the first portion of the subclavian artery, and enters the chest between it and the sub- clavian vein. Within the chest it passes downwards through the middle mediastinum, lying between the pleura and pericardium, and in front of the root of the lung, to the diaphragm ; near the diaphragm it divides into branches which pierce that muscle, and are distributed on its under surface. Some of its filaments reach the abdomen through the openings for the oesophagus and vena cava, and communicate with the phrenic and solar plexus, and on the right side with the hepatic plexus. The left phrenic nerve is longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side, and crossesthe arch of the aorta. The right nerve is situated more deeply n the upper part of the chest than the left, and lies in contact with the right vena innominata and superior vena cava. Both nerves cross in front of the origin of the internal mammary artery at their entrance into the chest. Posterior cervical nerves.—The posterior cords of the cervical nerves issue from between the transverse processes; and divide into an internal and external branch. The internal branch is directed inwards towards the middle of the spine, and, becoming cutaneous near the spinous processes of the vertebra?, is then reflected out- wards to supply the integument. The external branch, smaller thanBRACHIAL PLEXUS. 503 the internal, is distributed to the muscles of the outer portion of the vertebral groove. The posterior cord of the first cervical nerve (sub-occipital), larger than the anterior, escapes from the vertebral canal through the opening for the vertebral artery, lying posteriorly to that vessel, and emerges in the triangular space formed by the rectus posticus major, obliquus superior, and obliquus inferior. It is distributed to the recti, obliqui and complexus, and sends a branch down- wards to communicate with the second cervical nerve ; it has no external branch. The posterior cord of the second cervical nerve is three or four times larger than its anterior cord, and exceeds in size the other posterior cervical nerves. Its internal branch is the occipitalis major nerve. The posterior cord of the third cervical nerve is smaller than the second, but larger than the fourth ; its internal branch gives off a cutaneous branch to the back of the cranium. The posterior cords of the remaining cervical nerves go on pro- gressively decreasing in size to the seventh. The 'internal branches of the second, third, fourth and fifth nerve lie on the semispinalis colli muscle, and are closely connected with a fascia which separates that muscle from the complexus. The second and third, with a branch from the first, constitute the pos- terior cervical plexus; and all the branches in their course to the surface pierce the complexus and trapezius and some the splenitis. The internal branches of the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerve pass beneath the semispinalis colli, and are lost in the muscles without reaching the integument. The Occipitalis major nerve, the internal branch of the posterior cord of the second cervical nerve, ascends obliquely inwards between the obliquus inferior and complexus, pierces the complexus and trapezius after passing for a short distance between them, and ascends the posterior aspect of the head in company with the occipital artery. Soon after its escape from the trapezius, it receives a branch from the third cervical, and divides into numerous branches, which are distributed to the occipitalis muscle and to the integument as far as the summit of the head. It communicates with the occipitalis minor nerve, and sends an auricular branch to the back of the ear. BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The Brachial or axillary plexus of nerves is formed by commu- nications between the anterior cords of the four lower cervical nerves and first dorsal. These nerves are alike in size, and their mode of disposition in the formation of the plexus as follows : the fifth and sixth unite to form a common trunk ; the last cervical and first dorsal also unite to form a single trunk ; the seventh cervical nerve lies for some distance apart from the rest, and then divides into two branches, which join the other cords. At the point ofBRACHIAL NERVES. 504 junction the plexus consists of two cords, from which a third is given off, and the three become placed, one to the inner side of the axillary artery, one behind, and one to its outer side. Lower down, each of the lateral cords gives off a branch which unites with its fellow in front of the artery, and surrounds the vessel ; the trunk formed by the union of the two branches being the median nerve-. The plexus is broad in the neck, narrows as it descends into the axilla, and again enlarges at its lower part, where it divides into its terminal branches. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by means of a branch from the fourth,to the fifth nerve ; and receives branches from the two inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. The plexus is in relation in the neck with the scaleni muscles ; lower down it is placed between the clavicle and subclavius muscle above, and the first rib and first serration of the serratus magnus muscle below. In the axilla, it is situated at first to the outer side of and then behind the axillary artery, resting by its outer border against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Lower down it completely surrounds the artery. The branches of the brachial plexus are : from the outer cord, one of the anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median; from the inner cord, the other anterior thoracic nerve, inner head of the median, internal cuta- neous, lesser internal cutaneous of Wrisberg, and ulnar; from the posterior cord, the subscapular nerves, circumflex, and musculo- spiral. Besides these, the brachial plexus, while in the neck, gives off several superior muscular branches ; one to the subclavius muscle, one to the rhomboid muscles and levator anguli scapulae ; one of large size, the suprascapular ; and a long and slender nerve which passes down the thoracic wall of the axilla, the posterior thoracic, or external respiratory nerve of Bell. In reference to their distribution, the branches of the brachial plexus may be arranged in three groups, thoracic, scapular, and brachial, as follows :— Thoracic. Scapular. Anterior thoracic, Superior muscular, Posterior thoracic. Suprascapular, Subscapular. Brachial. Musculo-cutaneous, Internal cutaneous, Lesser internal cutaneous, Median, Ulnar, Musculo-spiral, Circumflex.505 MUSCULOCUTANEOUS NERVE. The Anterior thoracic nerves, two in number, proceed, one from the external cord of the plexus, the other from the internal cord,,^**1" The former, the external or superficial branch, crosses the axilidxy f,. artery in the space above the pectoralis minor to the front^ theV*; '"' chest, and is distributed to the pectoralis major muscle. JThe^* ternal or deeper branch issues from between the axillary ajfter^;. ancl £M vein, and after forming a loop of communication with the preceding, is distributed to the under surface of the pectoralis minor andtaajorX'^ The Posterior thoracic, or external respiratory of Belly is forSfeq* ' by the j unction of two offsets, one from the fifth, the other from the sixth cervical nerve ; it crosses behind the brachial plexus^ to reac&;^ '%*■. the side of the chest, and descends on the serratus niagnusHQ the lower part of that muscle, to which it is distributed. The Superior muscular nerves are small branches to the longus colli and scaleni ; and branches to the rhomboidei and subclavius. The Rhomboid branch proceeds from the fifth cervical nerve, and passing backwards through the fibres of the scalenus medius, and beneath the levator anguli scapulae, is distributed to the under surface of the rhomboid muscles. In its course it sometimes gives a branch to the levator anguli scapula. The Subclavian branch, proceeding from the cord formed by the fifth and sixth nerve, descends in front of the subclavian artery to the subclavius muscle. This nerve usually communicates with the phrenic at its entrance into the chest. The Suprascapular nerve arises from the fifth cervical nerve, and proceeds obliquely outwards to the suprascapular notch; it passes through the notch, crosses the supra-spinous fossa beneath the supra-spinatus muscle, and running in front of the concave margin of the spine of the scapula enters the infra-spinous fossa, to be distributed to the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus muscle, and send two or three filaments to the shoulder-joint. The Subscapular nerves are three in number : one arises from the brachial plexus above the clavicle, the others from the posterior cord of the plexus within the axilla. The first or smallest supplies the upper part of the subscapularis muscle ; the second and largest {long subscapular) follows the course of the subscapular artery, and is distributed to the latissimus dorsi; the third supplies the lower part of the subscapularis muscle and teres major. Brachial nerves.—The brachial branches of the plexus are arranged in the following order ; musculocutaneous, and one head of the median to the outer side of the artery ; the other head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous, and ulnar, to its inner side ; the circumflex and musculo-spiral behind. The Musculocutaneous nerve (external cutaneous, perforans Casserii) arises from the brachial plexus in common with the ex- ternal head of the median; pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle,506 INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. and passes between the biceps and bracbialis anticus to the outer side of the bend of the elbow, where it perforates the deep fascia, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch. These branches pass behind the median cephalic vein, the anterior the larger of the two, taking the course of the radial vein and communicating with the radial nerve on the back of the hand ; the posterior and smaller following the direction of the supinator longus, communi- cating with the internal cutaneous, and at the lower third of the forearm sending off an arterial twig, which accompanies the radial artery to the wrist, and distributes filaments to the synovial mem- branes of the joint. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus in the upper arm, and the integument of the outer side of the forearm as far as the wrist and hand. The Internal cutaneous nerve, one of the internal and smaller branches of the axillary plexus, arises from the plexus in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and passes down the inner side of the arm in company with the basilic vein, giving off several cutaneous filaments in its course. At about the middle of the upper arm it pierces the deep fascia by the side of the basilic vein and divides into two branches, external and internal. The external branch, the larger of the two, divides into several branches which pass in front of, and sometimes behind, the median basilic vein at the bend of the elbow, and descend in the course of the palmaris longus muscle to the wrist, distributing filaments to the integument in their course and communicating with the anterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous on the outer side, and its own internal branch on the inner side of the forearm. The internal branch sends off several twigs to the integument over the inner con- dyle and olecranon, passes behind the inner condyle, and descends the forearm in the course of the ulnar vein as far as the wrist, supplying the integument of the inner side of the forearm, and communicating with the external branch of the same nerve in front, and the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. The Lesser internal cutaneous nerve or nerve of Wrisberg, the smallest of the brachial nerves, arises with the preceding from the inner cord of the plexus, and issuing from beneath the axillary vein descends the inner side of the arm, to the middle of its poste- rior aspect, where it pierces the fascia and is distributed to the integument of the lower third of the upper arm as far as the ole- cranon. While in the axilla, the nerve of Wrisberg communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and sometimes its place is taken by the latter. The Median nerve, named from its median position in the armMEDIAN NERVE. °d 50? and fbi'earm, arises by two heads which proceed from the outer and inner cord of the plexus and embrace the axillary artery. The nerve lies at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, but crosses it in the middle, some- times in front and sometimes be- hind, and getting to its inner side descends to the bend of the elbow. It next passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres and beneath the flexor sublimis digitorum, and runs down the middle of the forearm, lying between the latter muscle and the flexor profundus to the wrist. It then dips beneath the annular ligament and enters the palm of the hand. Just above the wrist it is superficial, lying by the outer border of the ten- dons of ^he flexor sublimis digi- torum. The Branches of the median nerve are— Muscular, Anterior interosseous, Superficial palmar, Digital. The Muscular brandies are given off by the nerves at the bend of the elbow ; they ai-e distri- buted to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar half of the flexor profundus. The branch to_ the pronator radii teres sends off reflected filaments to the elbow-joint. Fig. 199.* * Brachial plexus of nerves with its branches and their distribution. 1. Bra- chial plexus. 2.

The Anterior interosseous is a large branch accompanying the anterior interosseous artery, and supplying the deep layer of muscles of the forearm ; being lost inferiority in the pronator quadratus. The Superficial 'palmar branch arises from the median at about the lower fourth of the forearm ; it crosses the annular ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the palm of the hand, and ball of the thumb. The median nerve at its termination in the palm of the hand is spread out and flattened, and divides into six branches, one mus- cular and five digital. The muscular branch is distributed to the muscles of the ball of the thumb. The digital branches are arranged as follows : two pass outwards to the thumb and supply its borders; the third runs along the radial side of the index finger, sending a twig to the first lumbri- calis, in its course ; the fourth subdivides for the supply of the adjacent sides of the index and middle finger, and gives a twig to the second lumbricalis ; the fifth receives a filament of communica- tion from the ulnar nerve, and supplies the collateral branches of the middle and ring finger. Opposite the base of the first phalanx, each nerve gives off a dorsal branch which„runs along the border of the dorsum of the finger. Near its extremity the nerve divides into a palmar and a dorsal branch ; the former supplying the sentient extremity of the finger ; the latter the structures around and beneath the nail. The digital nerves in their course along the fingers lie to the inner side of and superficially to the arteries ; and the nerve of one side of a finger has no communication with that of the opposite side. The Ulnar nerve is somewhat smaller than the median, behind which it lies, gradually diverging from it in its course. It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus in common with the internal head of the median and internal cutaneous nerve, and runs down the inner side of the arm, to the groove between the internal condyle and olecranon, resting on the internal head of the triceps, and accompanied by the inferior profunda artery. At the elbow it is superficial, and supported by the inner condyle, against which it may be compressed, giving rise to the thrilling sensation along the inner side of the forearm and little finger, popularly ascribed to cular branches. 13.

It then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and descends along the inner side of the forearm, crosses the annular ligament, and divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. At the commencement of the middle third of the forearm it comes into relation with the artery, and lies to the ulnar side of that vessel, as far as the hand. The Branches of the ulnar nerve are— Articular, Dorsal branch, Muscular, Superficial palmar, Cutaneous, Deep palmar. The Articular branches are several filaments to the elbow-joint, given off from the nerve while lying in the groove between the inner condyle and olecranon. The Muscular branches are distributed to the flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of the flexor profundus digitorum. The Cutaneous branch proceeds from about the middle of the nerve, and descends upon the ulnar artery-to the hand, giving twigs to the integument in its course. One branch from its upper part, sometimes a separate offset from the nerve and sometimes absent, pierces the fascia, and communicates with the internal cutaneous nerve. The Dorsal branch passes backwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, at the lower fourth of the forearm, and divides into branches which supply the integument and two fingers and a half on the posterior aspect of the hand, communicating with the radial nerve, with which it forms an arch. The Superficial palmar branch, after giving some twigs to the palmaris brevis and inner border of the hand, divides into three filaments, two of which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, and one to the adjoining borders of the little and ring finger, while the third, a communicating branch, joins the median nerve. The Deep palmar branch passes between the abductor and flexor minimi digiti, to the deep palmar arch, supplying the muscles of the little finger, interossei, two ulnar lumbricales, adductor pollicis, and inner head of the "flexor brevis pollicis. The Muscttlo-spiral nerve, the largest branch of the brachial plexus, arises from its posterior trunk in common with the circum- flex, and, descending behind the axillary and brachial artery, winds around the humerus between the triceps and the bone, and in com- pany with the superior profunda artery, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, and thence onwards to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two branches, radial and posterior interosseous.510 MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE. The Branches of the niusculo-spiral nerve are— Muscular, Cutaneous, Radial, Posterior interosseous. The Muscular branches are distributed to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi, radialis longior. The Cutaneous branches are three in number, internal and two external. The internal branch arises from the nerve in the axilla, and piercing the deep fascia in the upper third of the arm on its posterior aspect, communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the posterior aspect of the upper arm, as far as the olecranon. The external cutaneous branches pass through the substance of the external head of the triceps, and pierce the deep fascia ; one, upper, near the insertion of the deltoid, the other, lower, at about the middle of the upper arm. The upper branch follows the course of the cephalic vein, supplying the integument of the outer and fore part of the upper arm as far as the bend of the elbow. The lower branch passes down the outer side of the forearm, reaches the posterior aspect at about its middle, and is continued onwards to the wrist, where it communicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous. The Radial nerve runs along the radial side of the forearm to the commencement of its lower third ; it there passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and, at about two inches above the wrist- joint, pierces the deep fascia and divides into an external and in- ternal branch. The external branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the outer border of the thumb, and communicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The internal branch crosses the direction of the extensor tendons of the thumb, and divides into several filaments for the supply of the ulnar border of the thumb, radial border of the index finger, and adjacent borders of the index and middle finger. It communicates above the wrist with the pos- terior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and on the back of the hand forms an arch by joining with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. On the backs of the fingers the digital branches com- municate with those of the median nerve. In the upper third of the forearm the radial nerve lies beneath the border of the supinator longus muscle ; in the middle third it is in relation with the radial artery, lying to its outer side; and in the lower third it quits the artery, and passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to reach the back of the hand. The Posterior interosseous nerve, somewhat larger than the radial, separates from the latter at the bend of the elbow, pierces the supinator brevis muscle, and emerges from its lower border on theDORSAL NERVES. 511 posterior aspect of the forearm, where it divides into branches which supply all the muscles of the posterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the anconeus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. One branch, longer than the rest, descends upon the interosseous membrane to the posterior part of the wrist, and forms a gangliform swelling (a common character of nerves which supply joints), from which numerous filaments are distri- buted to the wrist-joint. The Circumflex nerve arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus in common with the musculo-spiral. It passes downwards over the border of the subscapulars muscle, winds around the neck of the humerus with the posterior circumflex artery, and splits into an upper and lower division ; the upper division is continued onwards beneath the deltoid, and distributed to the ante- rior part of that muscle, some of its branches piercing the muscular fibres and becoming cutaneous. The lower division sends a branch (remarkable for a gangliform swelling) to the teres minor, several branches to the posterior part of the deltoid, and mounting upon the border of that muscle becomes cutaneous, supplying the integu- ment over its lower half by means of several filaments. Besides its muscular and cutaneous branches, the trunk of the nerve gives off" an articular branch, which enters the shoulder-joint at its posterior and under part. DORSAL NERVES. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number at each side ; the first appearing between the first and second dorsal vertebra; the last between the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar. They are smaller than the lower cervical nerves ; diminish gradually in size from the first to the tenth, and then increase to the twelfth. Each nerve, as soon as it has escaped from the intervertebral foramen, separates into an anterior and posterior cord ; the anterior cords being the intercostal nerves, the posterior the dorsal branches of the dorsal nerves. The Dorsal branches pass directly backwards between the trans- verse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and each nerve divides into an internal and external branch. The internal branches diminish in size from the first to the last. The six upper branches pass inwards between the semispinalis dorsi and multifidus spinse, and, piercing the rhomboid, trapezius and latissimus dorsi, become cutaneous close to the spinous processes, and are then reflected outwards to supply the integument. The six lower branches are lost in the muscles of the spine. The external' branches increase in size from above downwards, and make their appearance in the line of separation between the longissimus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis. The six upper branches are distributed to those muscles and the levatores costarum. The sixINTERCOSTAL NERVES. 512 lower, after supplying the same muscles, piece the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi in a line with the angles of the ribs, and becoming cutaneous, are directed downwards and forwards over the side of the trunk. Intercostal nerves.—The anterior cords of the dorsal nerves, twelve in number at each side, are the intercostal nerves. Each intercostal nerve passes outwards in the intercostal space in com- pany with the intercostal vessels, below which it lies; at the com- mencement of its course it rests on the external intercostal muscle, further outwards it is placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles ; beyond the middle of the rib it enters the substance of the internal intercostal and reaches its inner surface, being in contact with the pleura; finally, at the anterior extremity of the intercostal space, it crosses in front of the triangularis sterni and internal mammary vessels and piercing the internal intercostal muscle and pectoralis major, is distributed to the integument of the front of the chest and mammary gland, under the name of anterior cutaneous. The intercostal nerve, near its origin, sends one or two filaments to the neighbouring dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic, and midway between the vertebral column and sternum, while situated between the intercostal muscles, gives off a lateral cutaneous branch which pierces the external intercostal muscle and divides into an anterior and posterior twig for the supply of the integument of the side of the thorax. This description applies in full only to the six upper intercostal nerves ; the six lower, with the exception of the last, cross the car- tilages of the ribs where the thorax is deficient and take their course between the internal oblique and transversalis muscle to the sheath of the rectus, and, after supplying that muscle, to the linea alba, by the side of which they reach the integument constituting the an- terior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. The first and the last intercostal nerve are exceptions to this general scheme of distribution. The first ascends over the first rib to join the brachial plexus, and gives off only a small branch, to take the usual course of the other intercostal nerves. The last or twelfth nerve lies below the last rib, and after crossing the quadratus lumborum takes its course between the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscle like the other inferior intercostals. Near its origin it sends a branch, the clorsi-lumbar, downwards to join the first lumbar nerve. The branches of the intercostal nerves are, muscular, lateral cutaneous, and anterior cutaneous. The muscular branches are small twigs distributed to the inter- costal and neighbouring muscles. The Lateral cutaneous nerves, given off from the intercostals at about the middle of the lateral half of the thorax, pierce the ex- ternal intercostal muscle and pass between the fibres of the serratusLUMBAR NERVES. 513 magnus above and the obliquus externus below to reach the surface. The lateral cutaneous nerve then divides into an anterior and pos- terior branch. The anterior branches are directed forwards to supply the integument of the antero-lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior branches turning around the inferior border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland. The posterior branches take their course backwards to supply the integument of the postero- lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior turning around the posterior border of the axilla to reach the integument over the lower part of the scapula and latissimus dorsi; and that from the third intercostal being distributed to the integument of the axilla and neighbouring part of the arm. The first intercostal gives off no lateral cutaneous nerve; the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve will be presently described, under the name of intercosto-humeral nerve. The lateral cutaneous branch of the last intercostal nerve pierces the internal and external oblique muscle, crosses the crest of the ilium just behind the tensor vaginae femoris, and is distributed to the integument of the anterior part of the gluteal region as low down as the trochanter major. The Anterior cutaneous nerves are divided according to their position into those of the thorax and those of the abdomen. Having reached the surface they are reflected outwards to supply the integu- ment of the front of the trunk. The anterior cutaneous branches of the third and fourth intercostal nerve are distributed to the mammary gland. The Intercosto-humeral nerve is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve ; after piercing the external intercostal muscle, it passes downwards into the axilla and communicates with a branch of the lesser internal cutaneous nerve of Wrisberg. It then perforates the deep fascia, and is distributed to the integument of the inner and back part of the arm to about the middle, and to the integument covering the lower part of the scapula. On the back of the arm it communicates with the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. This nerve sometimes takes the place of the nerve of Wrisbei-g. LUMBAR NERVES. There are five pairs of lumbar nerves, of which the first makes its appearance between the first and second lumbar vertebra; the last between the fifth lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The anterior cords increase in size from above downwards. They com- municate at their origin with the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic, and pass obliquely outwards behind the psoas magnus, or between i its fasciculi, sending twigs to that muscle and to the quadratus i lumborum. In this situation each nerve divides into two branches, a superior branch which ascends to form a loop of communication L LILIOINGUINAL NERVE. 514 with the nerve above ; and an inferior branch which descends to join in like manner the nerve below. The communications and anastomoses which are thus established constitute the lumbar plexus. The posterior cords diminish in size from above downwards; they pass backwards between the transverse processes of the corresponding vertebrse, and each nerve divides into an internal and external branch. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, passes in- wards to be distributed to the multifidus spinse and inter-spinales. The external branches communicate with each other by several loops, and, after supplying the deeper muscles, pierce the sacro- lumbalis to reach the integument to which they are distributed. The external branches of the three upper lumbar nerves descend over the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and are distributed to the integument of the gluteal region. Lumbar plexus.—The Lumbar plexus is formed by the commu- nications and anastomoses which take place between the anterior divisions of the four upper lumbar nerves, and between the latter and the last dorsal. It is narrow above, increases in breadth in- ferior] y, and is situated between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrse and quadratus lumborum behind, and the psoas magnus muscle in front. The Branches of the lumbar plexus are the— Ilio-hypogastric, External cutaneous, Ilio-inguinal, Obturator, Genito-crural, Anterior crural. The Ilio-hypogastric nerve (superior musculo-cutaneous) pro- ceeds from the first lumbar nerve, and passes obliquely outwards between the fibres of the psoas magnus and across the quadratus lumborum to about the middle of the crest of the ilium. It then pierces the transversalis muscle, and between it and the internal oblique divides into its two terminal branches, iliac and hypogastric. The iliac branch pierces the internal and external oblique mus- cles close to their attachment, and a little behind the middle of the crest of the ilium ; it is distributed to the integument of the outer part of the hip. The hypogastric branch continues its course onwards, piercing first the internal oblique, and just above the external abdominal ring the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is distributed to the integument of the hypogastric region and mons pubis. The Ilio-inguinal nerve (inferior musculo-cutaneous), smaller than the preceding, also arises from the first lumbar nerve. It passes obliquely downwards and outwards below the ilio-hypogastric nerve, and crosses the quadratus lumborum and iliacus muscle to the anterior part of the crest of the ilium ; it then pierces the515 GENITO-CRURAL NERVE. transversalis muscle, and between tl ternus communicates with the hypo- gastric nerve. It next pierces the obliquus internus, and following the course of the spermatic cord, escapes at the external abdominal ring to be distributed to the scrotum and to the integument of the upper part of the thigh, internally to the saphenous opening; and in the female to that of the pudendum. The GrENiTo-CRURAL nerve pro- ceeds from the second lumbar and by a few filaments from the loop between it and the first. It tra- verses the psoas magnus from be- hind forwards, and runs down the anterior surface of that muscle, lying beneath its fascia, to near Poupart's ligament, where it di- vides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch (n. spermati- ds seu pudendus externus) crosses * A diagram showing the lumbar and sacral plexuses, with the nerves of the lower extremity. 1.

In the female it gives twigs to the round ligament and external labium. At the internal abdominal ring this nerve sends off a branch, which, after supplying the lower border of the inter- nal oblique and transversalis, is lost in the integument of the groin. The crural branch (lumbo-inguinalis), the most external of the two, descends along the outer border of the external iliac artery, and, crossing the origin of the circumflexa ilii, enters the sheath of the femoral vessels in front of the femoral artery. It pierces the sheath below Poupart's ligament, and is distributed to the integu- ment of the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as its middle. This nerve communicates with the middle cutaneous branch of the crural nerve, and is often very small. The External cutaneous nerve (inguino-cutaneus) proceeds from the second lumbar, and from the loop between it and the third. It pierces the posterior fibres of the psoas muscle ; and crossing the iliacus on the iliac fascia, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, passes into the thigh, beneath Poupart's ligament, where it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The posterior branch crosses the tensor vaginae femoris muscle to the outer and posterior side of the thigh, and supplies the integu- ment in that region. The anterior nerve, after passing for three or four inches down the thigh in a sheath formed by the fascia lata, becomes superficial, and divides into two branches, which are distributed to the integu- ment of the outer border of the thigh, and to the articulation of the knee. The Obturator nerve is formed by a branch from the third, and another from the fourth lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the obturator externus and adductor muscles of the thigh, the hip and knee joint, the femoral and popliteal artery, and sometimes to the integument of the upper and inner part of the leg. From its origin it takes its course among the fibres of the psoas muscle, through the angle of bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, and along the inner border of the brim of the pelvis, to the obturator foramen, where it joins the obturator artery. Having escaped from the pelvis, it divides into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branch passes downwards in front of the adductor brevis, supplies that muscle together with the pectineus, gracilis, and adductor longus, and at the lower border of the latter unites ■with the internal cutaneous and long saphenous nerve, to form a plexus. It then passes onwards to the femoral artery, to which it distributes filaments. In its course this nerve gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint; and a cutaneous branch, which pierces the fascia lata at the knee, communicates with the long saphenous517 ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the leg as far as its middle. The cutaneous branch is often wanting, its place being supplied by the internal cutaneous nerve, and some- times by the accessory obturator. The posterior branch pierces the obturator extern us muscle, to which and to the adductor magnus it distributes branches ; it also gives off an articular branch which pierces the adductor magnus muscle, and accompanies the popliteal artery to the'knee-joint. The A ccessory obturator nerve, small and inconstant, is a high division of the obturator, being sometimes derived from it near its origin, and sometimes by separate filaments from the third and fourth lumbar nerve. It passes down the inner border of the psoas muscle, crosses the os pubis, and dips beneath the pectineus, where it divides into branches. One of its branches is distributed to the pectineus, another supplies the hip-joint, while a third communi- cates with the anterior branch of the obturator nerve, and when of large size constitutes its cutaneous branch. As already stated, the existence of the accessory obturator nerve is uncertain. The Anterior crural or femoral nerve is the largest of the divisions of the lumbar plexus ; it is formed by the union of branches from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the thigh, leg, and foot, to all the muscles of the front of the thigh (excepting one), to the iliacus, pectineus, femoral artery, and knee-joint. Emerging from beneath the psoas, the nerve passes downwards in the groove between that muscle and the iliacus, and beneath Poupart's liga- ment into the thigh, where it spreads out and divides into numerous branches. At Poupart's ligament it is separated from the femoral artery by the breadth of the psoas muscle, which at this point is scarcely more than half an inch in diameter, and by the iliac fascia, beneath which it lies. Branches.—Within the pelvis, the anterior crural nerve gives off three or four twigs to the iliacus muscle, and a branch to the femo- ral artery. The latter divides into filaments which entwine about the artery, and follow its course downwards in the thigh. Below Poupart's ligament the crural nerve becomes flattened out, and divides into numerous branches, which may be arranged into two principal groups, superficial and deep. The separate branches of these groups are as follow : Long or Internal saphenous. The Middle cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia lata at about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into two branches, which pass down the inner and front part of the thigh, and are dis- Superficial. Middle cutaneotis, Internal cutaneous, Deep. Muscular, Articular.INTERNAL SAPHENOUS NERVE. 518 tributed to the integument as low as the knee-joint. At its upper part the external branch communicates with the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve ; and below, the internal branch communi- cates with the internal cutaneous. One or both of these branches sometimes pierce the sartorius muscle. The Internal cutaneous nerve passes inwards in front of the sheath of the femoral artery, and divides into an anterior and an inner branch. Previously to its division it gives off three cutaneous filaments, which pierce the fascia near the internal saphenous vein, and following the course of that vessel, are distributed to the in- tegument of the inner side of the thigh as low down as the knee. The uppermost of these filaments passes through the saphenous opening, the middle becomes subcutaneous at about the middle of the thigh, and the lowest pierces the fascia at its lower third. The anterior branch passes down the inner side of the thigh, and pierces the fascia at its lower third, near the internal saphenous vein. It then divides into two twigs, one of which continues on- wards to the inner side of the knee ; while the other curves outwards to its outer side, communicating in its course with a branch of the long saphenous nerve. The inner branch descends along the inner and posterior border of the sartorius muscle to the knee, where it pierces the fascia lata, and gives off several cutaneous twigs. It then sends a small branch of communication to the long saphenous nerve, and passes down- wards along the inner side of the leg, to which it is distributed. While beneath the fascia lata it aids in the formation of a plexus by uniting with branches of the long saphenous nerve and descending branch of the obturator. When the latter is large the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve is small, and may terminate in the plexus, or merely give off a few cutaneous filaments. The Long or internal saphenous nerve inclines inwards to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and passes downwards in front of the sheath and beneath the aponeurotic expansion which covers the sheath, to the opening in the adductor magnus. It then quits the femoral vessels, and continuing to descend, passes between the ten- dons of the sartorius and gracilis, and reaches the internal saphenous vein. By the side of the latter it passes down the inner side of the leg, in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the foot as far as the great toe ; being distributed to the integument in its course. The branches of the long saphenous nerve in the thigh are : one or two to join the plexus formed by the obturator and internal cutaneous nerve ; and a large branch, the cutaneus patellce, which pierces the sartorius and fascia lata at the inner side of the knee, and divides into many twigs, which are distributed to the integu- ment of the front of the knee. Above the patella this branch com- municates with the anterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve, and with the terminal twigs of the middle, and external cutaneous.519 SACRAL NERVES. Below the patella it communicates with other branches of the long saphenous ; the whole of these communications constituting a kind of plexus (plexus patelke). The branches of the long saphenous nerve below the knee are distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the leg. By one of these branches it communicates with the cutaneous branch of the obturator nerve. The Muscular branches of the anterior crural nerve supply all the muscles of the front of the thigh (with the exception of the tensor vaginse femoris, which obtains its nerve from the superior gluteal) and the pectineus. The branch to the pectineus passes behind the sheath of the femoral vessels ; the branches to the sar- torius, three or four in number, arise with the cutaneous nerves, and sometimes are supplied by the latter. The branch to the rectus enters the deep surface of that muscle. The branch to the vastus extemus follows the course of the descending branch of the external circumflex artery ; the branch to the crureus passes directly to that muscle ; and the branch to the vastus interims, remarkable for its length, descends by the side of the sheath of the femoral vessels. The Articular branches are distributed to the knee-joint ; one enters the joint at its outer side, being derived from the nerve of the vastus externus ; the other, proceeding from the nerve of the vastus internus, descends with the anastomotica magna to a level with the joint, and then pierces the capsular ligament. The Lumbo-sacral nerve.—The anterior division of the fifth lumbar nerve, conjoined with a branch from the fourth, constitutes the lumbo-sacral nerve, which descends over the base of the sacrum into the pelvis, and assists in forming the sacral plexus. SACRAL NERVES. There are five pairs of sacral nerves ; the first four escape from the vertebral canal through the sacral foramina, the last between the sacrum and coccyx. The posterior sacral nerves are small, and diminish in size from above downwards ; they communicate with each other by means of anastomosing loops immediately after their escape from the posterior sacral foramina, and divide like the other spinal nerves into external and internal branches. The external branches pierce the gluteus maximus, to which they give filaments, and are distributed to the integument of the posterior part of the gluteal region. The internal branches supply the multificlus spinEe muscle and the integument over the sacrum and coccyx. The anterior sacral nerves diminish in size from above down- wards ; the first is large, and unites with the lumbo-sacral nerve; the second, of equal size, unites with the first ; and the third, scarcely one-fourth so large as the second, joins with the two pre- ceding nerves in the formation of the sacral plexus.SACRAL PLEXUS. 520 The fourth sacral nerve divides into two branches, one of which assists in forming the sacral plexus, the other separates into three branches : a communicating branch to unite with the fifth sacral nerve ; a visceral branch, to join with the hypogastric plexus and supply the bladder and prostate gland, and in the female, the vagina; and a muscular branch which sends filaments to the levator ani and coccygeus and a hcemorrhoiclal branch to the sphincter ani and integument behind the anus. The fifth sacral nerve, issuing from between the sacrum and coccyx, pierces the coccygeus muscle, and receives the communi- cating branch from the fourth ; it then communicates with the coccygeal nerve, and piercing the coccygeus a second time, is distri- buted to the integument over the dorsal surface of the coccyx. The coccygeal nerve pierces the coccygeus muscle, and unites with the fifth sacral nerve, in which it is lost. Each of the anterior cords of the sacral nerves communicates with the sympathetic at its point of escape from the sacral canal. Sacral plexus.—The Sacral plexus is formed by the union of the lumbo-sacral and the anterior cords of the three upper sacral nerves and one-half the fourth. The plexus is triangular in form, its base corresponding with the whole length of the sacrum, and its apex with the lower part of the great ischiatic foramen. It is in relation behind with the pyriformis muscle ; and in front with the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the internal iliac vessels and the viscera of the pelvis. The Branches of the sacral plexus are, The Visceral nerves are three or four large branches derived from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves : they ascend by the side of the rectum and bladder ; in the female by the side of the rectum, vagina, uterus, and bladder ; and interlace with branches of the hypogastric plexus, sending in their course numerous filaments to the pelvic viscera. The Muscular branches are one or two twigs to the levator ani ; an obturator branch, which curves around the spine of the ischium to reach the internal surface of the obturator internus muscle; two twigs to the pyriformis j a branch to the gemellus superior ; and a branch of moderate size, which descends between the gemelli muscles and the ischium, and is distributed to the gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and capsule of the hip-joint. Visceral, Muscular, Superior gluteal, Pudic, Lesser ischiatic, Greater ischiatic. The Superior gluteal nerve arises from the lumbo-sacral near its junction with the first sacral nerve ; it passes out of the pelvisPUDIC NERVE. 521 with the gluteal artery, through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The superior branch follows the direction of the superior curved line of the ilium, accompanying the deep superior branch of the gluteal artery, and sends filaments to the gluteus medius and minimus. The inferior branch passes obliquely downwards and forwards between the gluteus medius and minimus, distributing numerous filaments to both, and terminates in the tensor vaginae femoris muscle. The Pudic nerve arises from the lower part of the sacral plexus and passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle. It crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-entering the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, accompanies the internal pudic artery along the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, lying inferiorly to the artery and enclosed in the same sheath. Near its origin it gives off the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve, and in the ischio-rectal fossa divides into a superior and in- ferior branch. The Inferior hemorrhoidal nerve, often a branch of the sacral plexus, passes through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, and de- scends to the termination of the rectum to be distributed to the sphincter ani and integument. The Dorsalis penis nerve, the superior division of the internal pudic, ascends along the posterior surface of the ramus of the ischium, pierces the triangular ligament, and accompanies the arteria dorsalis penis to the glans, to which it is distributed. At the root of the penis the nerve gives off a cutaneous branch which runs along the side of the organ, gives filaments to the corpus cavernosum, and with its fellow of the opposite side supplies the integument of the upper two-thirds of the penis. The Perineal nerve, or inferior terminal branch, larger than the preceding, pursues the course of the superficial perineal artery in the perineum and divides into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal), two in number, posterior and anterior, enter the ischio-rectal fossa and pass forward with the superficial perineal artery to be distributed to the integu- ment of the perineum, scrotum, and under part of the penis. The posterior superficial perineal nerve sends a few filaments to the in- tegument of the anus and sphincter ani; while the anterior gives off one or two twigs to the levator ani. The muscular branches proceed from a single trunk, which passes inwards behind the transversus perinei muscle; they are distributed to the transversus perinei, accelerator urinse, and erector penis. The perineal nerve also sends two or three filaments to the corpus spongiosum. In the female the pudic nerve is distributed to the parts analo-GREAT ISCHIATIC NERVE. 522 gous to those of the male. The superior branch supplies the clitoris ; the inferior the vulva and perineum. The Lesser ischiatic nerve passes out of the pelvis through, the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, and continues its course downwards through the thigh to the lower part of the popliteal region, where it pierces the fascia and becomes sub- cutaneous. It then accompanies the external saphenous vein to the lower part of the leg, and communicates with the external saphenous nerve. The branches of the lesser ischiatic nerve are, muscular and cutaneous. The muscular or inferior gluteal are several large branches distributed to the gluteus maximus. The Cutaneous branches are divisible into external, internal, and middle. The external cutaneous branches are several filaments which turn around the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the integument over the hip and outer side of the thigh. The internal cutaneous branches are distributed to the in- tegument of the upper and inner part of the thigh. One of these larger than the rest, inferior pudendal, curves around the tuberosity of the ischium, pierces the fascia lata near the ramus of that bone, and, after communicating with one of the superficial perineal nerves, is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and penis. The middle cutaneous branches, two or three in number, are derived from the lesser ischiatic in its course down the thigh, and are dis- tributed to the integument. The Great ischiatic nerve is the largest nervous cord in the body; it is formed by the sacral plexus, or rather is a prolongation of the plexus, and at its exit from the great sacro-ischiatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle measures three-quarters of an inch, in breadth. It descends through the middle of the space between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, and along the posterior part of the thigh to its lower third, where it divides into two large terminal branches, internal and external popliteal. This division sometimes takes place at the plexus, and the two nerves descend side by side ; occasionally they are separated at their com- mencement by a part or by the whole of the pyriformis muscle. The nerve in its course down, the thigh rests on the gemellus supe- rior, tendon of the obturator internus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus, and is covered in by the gluteus maximus and biceps. The Branches of the great ischiatic nerve, previously to its division, are, muscular and articular. The Muscular branches are given off from the upper part of the nerve and supply both heads of the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and adductor magnus. The Articular branch descends to the upper part of the externalPLANTAR NERVES. 523 condyle of the femur, and divides into filaments, which are distri- buted to the fibrous capsule and synovial membrane of the knee- joint. The Internal popliteal nerve passes through the middle of the popliteal space, from the division of the great ischiatic nerve to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, accompanies the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial nerve. It is superficial in the whole of its course, and lies exter- nally to the vein and artery. The Branches of the internal popliteal nerve are, muscular or sural, articular, and a cutaneous branch, the external saphenous. The Muscular branches, of considerable size, and four or five in number, are distributed to the two heads of the gastrocnemius, to the soleus, plantaris, and popliteus. The Articular branches, two or three in number, supply the knee-joint, two of the twigs accompanying the internal articular arteries. The External or short saphenous nerve (communicans poplitei, vel tibialis) proceeds from the middle of the internal popliteal, and descends in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle to the middle of the leg ; it then pierces the fascia, and, after receiving the communicans peronei, comes into relation with the external saphenous vein, and follows the course of that vein to the outer ankle, to which, and to the integument of the heel and outer side of the foot (cutaneus dorsi pedis externus), it distributes branches. The Posterior tibial nerve is continued along the posterior aspect of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the posterior part of the inner ankle, where it divides into the in- ternal and external plantar nerve. In the upper part of its course it lies to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery ; it then be- comes placed superficially to that vessel, and at the ankle is situ- ated to its outer side ; in the lower third of the leg it lies parallel with the inner border of the tendo-Achillis. The Branches of the posterior tibial nerve are, three or four muscular twigs to the deep muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg, the branch to the flexor longus pollicis accompanies the fibular artery ; one or two filaments which entwine around the artery and then terminate in the integument ;* and'a plantar cutaneous branch which pierces the internal annular ligament and is distributed to the integument of the heel, and inner border of the sole of the foot. The Internal plantar nerve, larger than the external, crosses the posterior tibial vessels to enter the sole of the foot, and becomes * It is extremely interesting, in a physiological point of view, to observe the mode of distribution of these arterial filaments. They seem to be monitors to the artery of the presence or approach of danger.524 ANTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE. placed between the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum ; it then enters the sheath of the latter muscle, and divides opposite the base of the metatarsal bones into three digital branches ; one to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toe ; the second the adjacent sides of the second and third toe ; the third the cor- responding sides of the third and fourth toe. This distribution is precisely similar to that of the digital branches of the median nerve in the hand. In its course the internal plantar nerve gives off cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner side and sole of the foot; muscular branches to the muscles forming the inner and middle group of the sole ; a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe ; and articular branches to the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The External plantar nerve, the smaller of the two, follows the course of the external plantar artery to the outer border of the musculus accessorius, beneath which it sends several deep branches to supply the adductor pollicis, interossei, transversus pedis, and the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. It then gives branches to the integument of the outer border and sole of the foot, and sends forward two digital branches to supply the little toe and half the next. The External popliteal nerve (n. peroneus) one-half smaller than the internal, passes downwards by the side of the tendon of the biceps, and crosses the inner head of the gastrocnemius and the head of the soleus, to the neck of the fibula, it then pierces the peroneus longus muscle, and divides into two branches, anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous. The Branches of the external popliteal nerve are,, communicans peronei, cutaneous, and articular. The Communicans peronei, proceeding from the external pop- liteal near the head of the fibula, crosses the external origin of the gastrocnemius muscle, and, piercing the deep fascia, descends to the middle of the leg, where it joins the external saphenous nerve. It gives off one or two cutaneous filaments in its course. The Cutaneous branch passes down the outer side of the leg, supplying the integument. The Articular branches follow the external articular arteries to the knee-joint. The Anterior tibial nerve (n. interosseus, vel peroneus profun- dus) commences at the bifurcation of the external popliteal on the neck of the fibula, and passes beneath the upper part of the exten- sor longus digitorum, to reach the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, just as that vessel has emerged through the opening in the interosseous membrane. It descends the leg with the artery ; lyingSYMPATHETIC NERVES. 525 at first to its outer side, then in front of it, and near the ankle be- coming again placed to its outer side. Reaching the ankle it passes .beneath the annular ligament ; accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery, supplies the adjacent sides of the great and second toe, and communicates with the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Branches given off by the anterior tibial nerve are, muscular to the muscles in its course ; and at the ankle a tarsal branch which may be considered as one of the terminal divisions of the nerve. This branch passes outwards upon the dorsum of the foot, becomes ganglionic like the posterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, and supplies the extensor brevis digitorum muscle and the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve (n. peroneus superficialis) passes downwards along the fibula, in the substance of the peroneus longus ; it then gets between the peroneus longus and brevis, next between the peronei and extensor longus digitorum, and at the lower third of the leg pierces the deep fascia, and divides into the internal and external cutaneous nerves of the foot. In its course it gives off several branches to the peronei muscles. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the inner side of the foot and great toe, and communicates with the anterior tibial and internal saphenous. The external, or larger branch, supplies the adjacent sides of the second and third, third a,nd fourth, and fourth and fifth toes, and communicates with the external saphenous. SYMPATHETIC NERVES. The Sympathetic consists of a vertebral and prevertebral portion ; the vertebral portion is composed of a series of ganglia united by a longitudinal cord, it descends along each side of the vertebral column from the head to the coccyx, communicates with the cranial and spinal nerves, and distributes branches to the internal organs and viscera. The 'prevertebral portion is that part of the sympa- thetic which appertains to the viscera, comprising the numerous ganglia and plexuses of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The sympathetic nerve communicates with the cerebro-spinal nerves immediately at their exit from the cranium and vertebral canal. With the fourth and sixth nerve, however, it unites in the cavernous sinus ; with the olfactory in the nose; and with the audi- tory in the meatus auditorius internus. The branches of distribution accompany the arteries which supply the different organs, and form communications around them which are called plexuses and take the name of the artery with which they are associated ; thus we have the mesenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, and splenic plexus. All the internal organs of the head, neck, andOPHTHALMIC GANGLION. 52 6 trunk are supplied with branches from the sympathetic, and some of them exclusively ; hence it is denominated the nerve of organic life. It is called the ganglionic nerve from being constituted of a number of ganglia; and from the constant disposition which it evinces in its distribution, to communicate and form small knots or ganglia. There are four sympathetic ganglia in the head ; namely, the ophthalmic or lenticular, the spheno-palatine or Meckel's, the otic or Arnold's, and the submaxillary ; three in the neck, superior, middle, and inferior cervical; twelve in the dorsal region; four in the lumbar region ; and four or five in the sacral region. Each ganglion may be considered as a distinct centre, receiving and giving branches in four different directions, viz., superior or ascending, to communicate with the ganglion above ; inferior or descending, to communicate with the ganglion below; external, to communicate with the spinal nerves; and internal, to communicate with the sympathetic filaments of the opposite side, and be distri- buted to the viscera. As regards the spinal nerves it receives as well as gives, the white fibres of the sympathetic being derived from the cerebro- spinal nerves. CRANIAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. Cranial Ganglia. Ophthalmic, or lenticular ganglion, Spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion, Otic, or Arnold's ganglion, Submaxillary ganglion. The Ophthalmic ganglion (ciliary ; lenticular) is a small qua- drangular and flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve and external rectus muscle; it is in close relation with the optic nerve and generally with the ophthalmic artery; and is surrounded by adipose tissue, which renders its dissection some- what difficult. It is of a reddish-grey colour, like other sympa- thetic ganglia. Its branches of distribution are the short ciliary nerves, which arise from its anterior angles in two groups ; the upper group con- sisting of about four filaments ; the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into filaments which pierce the sclerotic around the optic nerve, to sup- ply the tunics of the eyeball. A small filament is said, by Tiede- mann, to accompany the arteria centralis retinse into the centre of the globe of the eye. Its branches of communication are three : one, the long root,OPHTHALMIC GANGLION. 527 proceeds from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and joins its superior angle; a short and thick branch, the short root, from the inferior division of the third nerve to its inferior angle; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, from the carotid plexus. Occasionally the ophthalmic ganglion receives also a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and sometimes from the abducens nerve.

It is of small size, of a reddish-grey colour, and triangular in shape ; and is placed on the posterior part of the spheno-palatine nerves which it only partially involves. Its branches are divisible into four groups ; ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. The ascending branches are three or four small filaments which are distributed to the periosteum of the orbit. One of these branches sometimes joins the ophthalmic ganglion ; one the sixth nerve ; and two the optic nerve. The descending branches are the three palatine nerves, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior or large palatine nerve descends from the ganglion through the posterior palatine canal, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen. It then passes forward in the substance of the hard palate to which it is distributed, and communicates with the naso-palatine nerve. While in the posterior palatine canal, this nerve gives off several branches {inferior nasal), which enter the nose through openings in the palate bone, and are distributed to the middle and inferior meatus, inferior spongy bone, and antrum. The middle or external palatine (nerve descends externally to the preceding to the posterior palatine foramen, and distributes branches to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. The posterior or small palatine nerve, quits the other nerves to enter a distinct canal, from which it emerges by a separate opening behind the posterior palatine foramen. It is distributed to the hard palate and gums near the point of its emergence, and also to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. The internal branches are the superior nasal and naso-palatine. The superior nasal nerves, four or five in number, enter the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the superior meatus, and superior and middle spongy bone. The naso-palatine nerve (Scarpa) enters the nasal fossa with the nasal nerves, and crosses the roof of the nares to reach the septum, to which it gives filaments. It then curves downwards and forwards to the naso-palatine canal, and passes through that canal to the palate, to which and to the papilla behind the incisor teeth it is distributed. This nerve was described by Cloquet as uniting with its fellow in the naso-palatine canal and constituting the naso- palatine ganglion. The existence of this ganglion is disputed. The posterior branches are the Vidian or pterygoid nerve, and the pharyngeal. The Vidian* nerve passes directly backwards from the spheno- * Guido Guidi, latinized into Vidus Vidius, was professor of anatomy and medicine in the College of France in 1542. His work is posthumous, and was published in 1611.SUBMAXILLARY GANGLION. 529 palatine ganglion, through the pterygoid or Vidian canal to the foramen lacerum basis cranii, where it divides into two branches, carotid and petrosal. The carotid branch (n. petrosus profundus) crosses the foramen lacerum, surrounded by the cartilaginous sub- stance which closes that opening, and enters the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. The petrosal branch (n. petrosus superfi- cial major) enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum basis cranii, piercing the cartilaginous substance, and passes backwards beneath the Casserian ganglion and dura mater, embedded in a groove on the anterior surface of the petrous bone, to the hiatus Fallopii. In the hiatus Fallopii it receives a branch from Jacobson's nerve, and terminates in the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. The pharyngeal nerve is a small branch which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pterygo-palatine artery, to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the Eustachian tube and neighbouring part of the pharynx. The Otic ganglion (Arnold's)* is a small oval-shaped and flat- tened ganglion, lying against the inner surface of the inferior maxil- lary nerve, close to the foramen ovale ; it is in relation, externally, with the trunk of that nerve, just at the point of union of the motor root; internally it rests against the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and tensor palati muscle ; and posteriorly is in contact with the arteria meningea media. It is closely adherent to the internal pterygoid nerve, and appears like a swelling on that nerve. The branches of the otic ganglion are six in number ; two of dis- tribution, and four of communication. The branches of distribution are, a,small filament to the tensor tympani muscle, and one or two to the tensor palati. The branches of communication are, one or two filaments from the inferior maxillary nerve (short root) ; one or two filaments from the auriculo-temporal nerve ; filaments from the nervi molles of the arteria meningea media, and the nervus petrosus snperficialis minor (long root). The latter nerve ascends from the ganglion to a small canal situated between the foramen ovale and foramen spinosum, and passes backwards on the petrous bone to the hiatus Fallopii, where it divides into two filaments. One of these filaments enters the hiatus and joins the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial ; the other passes to a minute foramen nearer the base of the petrous bone, and enters the tympanum, where it communicates with a branch of Jacobson's nerve. The Submaxillary ganglion is a small round or triangular ganglion situated on the submaxillary gland, in close relation with * Frederick Arnold, "Dissertatio Inauguralis de Parte Cephalica Nervi Sympathetici." Heidelberg, 1826; and " Ueber den Ohrknoten," 1828. M M530 CAROTID PLEXUS. the gustatory nerve, and near the posterior border of the mylo- hyoideus muscle. Its branches of distribution, six or eight in number, divide into many filaments, which supply the side of the tongue, the sub- maxillary gland, sublingual gland, and Wharton's duct. Its branches of communication are, two or three from and to the gustatory nerve ; one from the chorda tympani; two or three which form a plexus with branches of the hypoglossal nerve ; and one or two filaments which pass to tbe facial artery, and communi- cate with the nervi molles from the cervical portion of the sympa- thetic. Carotid plexus.—The ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion enters the carotid canal with the internal carotid artery, and divides into two branches, which form several loops of com- munication with each other around the artery. These branches, together with tbose derived from the carotid branch of the Vidian, constitute the carotid plexus. They also form frequently a small gangliform swelling at the under part of the artery, which is called the carotid ganglion. The latter, however, is not constant. The continuation of the carotid plexus onwards with the artery by the side of the sella turcica, is the cavernous plexus. The carotid plexus is the centre of communication between all the cranial ganglia, and, being derived from the superior cervical ganglion, between the cranial ganglia and those of the trunk ; it also communicates with the greater part of the cerebral nerves, and distributes filaments with each of the branches of the internal carotid, to accompany those branches to their ultimate ramifications. The branches which accompany the anterior cerebral artery at each side, unite upon the anterior communicating artery, and according to Kibes form a small ganglion, the ganglion of Ribes. The exist- ence of this ganglion is disputed. The ophthalmic ganglion communicates with the plexus by means of the long branch which reaches it from the cavernous plexus. The spheno-palatine joins the plexus by means of the carotid branch of the Vidian. The submaxillary ganglion is brought into connexion with it by means of the otic ganglion, and the otic ganglion by means of the tympanic nerve and Vidian. It communicates with the third nerve in the cavernous sinus, and through the ophthalmic ganglion ; frequently with the fourth in the formation of the nerve of the tentorium ; with the Casserian gan- glion ; with the ophthalmic division of the fifth in the cavernous sinus, and by means of the ophthalmic ganglion ; with the superior maxillary, through the spheno-palatine ganglion ; and with the in- ferior maxillary, through the otic ganglion. It sends two branches directly to the sixth nerve, which unite* with it as it crosses the * Panizza, in his " Experimental Kesearches on the Nerves," denies this communication, and states very vaguely that " they are merely lost and en- twined around it."—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Jan. 1836.531 CERVICAL GANGLIA. cavernous sinus ; it communicates with the facial and auditory- nerve, through the medium of the petrosal branch of the Vidian ; and with the glossopharyngeal by means of two filaments to the tympanic nerve. CERVICAL PORTION OP THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The superior cervical ganglion is long and fusiform, of a reddish- grey colour, smooth, and of considerable thickness, extending from within an inch of the carotid foramen in the petrous bone to oppo- site the lower border of the third cervical vertebra. It is in relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein ; and, behind, with the rectus anticus majur muscle. Its branches are divisible into superior, inferior, external, and internal; to which may be added, as proper to this ganglion, anterior. The superior (carotid nerve) is a single branch which ascends by the side of the internal carotid, and divides into two branches ; one lying to the outer, the other to the inner side of that vessel. The two branches enter the carotid canal, and, by their communications with each other and with the carotid branch of the Vidian, consti- tute the 'carotid plexus. The inferior or descending branch, sometimes two, is the cord of communication with the middle cervical ganglion. The external branches are numerous, and may be divided into two sets; those which communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and hypoglossal nerve ; and those which communi- cate with the first four cervical nerves. The internal branches are three in number ; pharyngeal, to as- sist in forming the pharyngeal plexus ; laryngeal, to join the supe- rior laryngeal nerve and its branches ; and, superior cardiac nerve, or nervus superficialis cordis. The anterior branches accompany the external carotid artery with its branches, around which they form plexuses, and here and there small ganglia ; they are named, from the softness of their texture, nervi molles, and from their reddish hue. nervi subrufi. The branches accompanying the facial artery are conducted by that vessel to the submaxillary ganglion, and those which accompany the internal maxillary artery reach the otic ganglion through the medium of the arteria meningea media. The Middle cervical ganglion (thyroid ganglion) is small, and sometimes wanting. It is situated opposite the fifth cervical ver- tebra, and rests against the inferior thyroid artery. This relation is so constant, as to have induced Haller to name it the '' thyroid ganglion." Its superior branch, or branches, ascend to communicate with the superior cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend to join the inferior cervical ganglion; m m 2532 CAEDIAC NERVES. one of these frequently passes in front of the subclavian artery, the other behind it. Its external brandies communicate with the fifth and sixth cervi- cal nerve. Its internal branches are filaments which accompany the inferior thyroid artery, inferior thyroid plexus; and the middle cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus magnus. The Inferior cervical ganglion (vertebral ganglion) is much larger than the preceding, and constant in its existence. It is of a semilunar form, and situated on the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, immediately behind the vertebral artery ; hence its designation u vertebral ganglion." Its superior branches communicate with the middle cervical ganglion. The inferior branches pass some before and some behind the sub- clavian artery, to join the first thoracic ganglion. The external branches consist of two sets ; one which communi- cates with the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical, and first dorsal nerve, and one which accompanies the vertebral artery along the vertebral canal, forming the vertebral plexus. The plexus sends filaments to all the branches given off by that artery, and com- municates in the cranium with the filaments of the carotid plexus accompanying the branches of the internal carotid artery. The internal branch is the inferior cardiac nerve, nervus cardi- acus minor. Cardiac nerves.—The cardiac nerves are three in number at each side, namely, superior, middle, and inferior. The Superior cardiac nerve {nervus superficialis cordis) proceeds from the lower part of the superior cervical ganglion ; it descends the neck behind the common carotid artery and parallel with the trachea, crosses the inferior thyroid artery, and running by the side of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, enters the chest. The nerve of the right side passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery and along the posterior aspect of the arteria innominata to the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve runs by the side of the left carotid artery, and crosses the arch of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. In its course it receives branches from the pneumogastric nerve, and sends filaments to the thyroid gland and trachea. The Middle cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus magnus) proceeds from the middle cervical ganglion, or, in its absence, from the cord of communication between the superior and inferior ganglion. It is the largest of the three nerves, and lies parallel with the recurrent laryngeal. At the root of the neck it divides into several branches, which pass some before and some behind the subclavian artery, communicates with the superior and inferior cardiac, pneumogastric533 DEEP CARDIAC PLEXUS. and recurrent nerve, and descends to the bifurcation of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus. The Inferior cardiac nerve (nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical ganglion, communicates with the recurrent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerve, and descends to the front of the bifurcation of the trachea, to the deep cardiac plexus. The Superficial cardiac plexus is situated immediately beneath the arch of the aorta and in front of the right pulmonary artery. It receives the superior cardiac nerve of the left side and the in- ferior cardiac branch of the left pneumogastric nerve, both of which cross the arch of the aorta between the left phrenic and pneumo- gastric nerve. It receives besides several filaments from the deep cardiac plexus, and sometimes a cardiac branch from the right pneumogastric nerve. Connected with the plexus is a small gan- glion (sometimes wanting), the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg, which lies close to the right side of the fibrous cord of the ductus arteri- osus. The superficial cardiac plexus gives off filaments which pass along the front of the left pulmonary artery to the root of the left lung, where they communicate with the anterior pulmonary plexus ; while the principal part of the plexus descends in the groove between the pulmonary artery and aorta to the anterior longitudinal sulcus of the heart, where it comes into relation with the anterior coro- nary artery, and becomes the anterior coronary plexus. At the base of the heart, the anterior coronary plexus receives several fila- ments from the deep cardiac plexus. Its branches are distributed to the substance of the heart in the course of the left or anterior coronary artery. The Deep or Great cardiac plexus is situated on the bifurca- tion of the trachea, above the right pulmonary artery and behind the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta. It receives, on the right side, the three cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the same side, and the cardiac branches of the right pneumogastric and right recurrent nerve. On the left side it receives the middle and infe- rior cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the left side ; the cardiac branches of the left pneumogastric (excepting the inferior), and several cardiac branches from the left recurrent nerve. In other words, it receives all the cardiac filaments of the sympathetic, pneumogastric, and recurrent nerves, with the exception of the left superior cardiac of the sympathetic (neiwus superficialis cordis) and the inferior cervical cardiac of the left pneumogastric, these two nerves being destined to the superficial cardiac plexus. The branches of the deep cardiac plexus, proceeding from its right and left division, pass downwards to join the coronary arteries, and outwards to the pulmonary plexuses. From the right division of the plexus the branches proceed before and behind the right pulmonary artery. Those which pass in front descend upon the trunk of the pulmonary artery to the left coro- nary artery, and help to form the anterior coronary plexus ; those534 GREAT SPLANCHNIC NERVE. which pass behind the right pulmonary artery are distributed to the right auricle ; a third set of filaments, proceeding from the right division of the deep cardiac plexus, follow the course of the right pulmonary artery to the anterior pulmonary plexus. From the left division of the plexus branches proceed beneath the arch of the aorta immediately to the right of the ligament of the ductus arteriosus to join the superficial cardiac plexus ; others pass outwards with the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary plexus ; a few descend to the left auricle; but the chief bulk pass on to the right coronary artery and form the posterior coronary plexus. The Anterior coronary plexus proceeds from the superficial car- diac plexus, and receives other filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. It is distributed with the branches of the coronary artery on the anterior aspect of the heart. The Posterior coronary plexus proceeds from the deep cardiac plexus and principally from its left division. It follows the course of the arteries distributed to the posterior aspect of the heart. THORACIC PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The thoracic portion of the sympathetic nerve is the trunk of the sympathetic in its course through the cavity of the thorax. It lies by the side of the vertebral column on the heads of the ribs and intercostal spaces ; but at its lowest part comes into relation with the sides of the bodies of the last two dorsal vertebrae. The Thoracic ganglia are twelve in number at each side. They are flattened and triangular, or irregular in form, and present the peculiar reddish grey colour and pearly lustre of sympathetic ganglia in general; they rest against the heads of the ribs, and are covered by the pleura costalis. The first two ganglia and the last are usually the largest; the latter being situated on the side of the body of the last dorsal vertebra. Their branches are branches of communication and branches of distribution. Some ascending filaments from the first ganglion assist in the formation of the vertebral plexus. The external or communicating branches, usually two in number for each ganglion, communicate with the intercostal nerves. The internal or visceral branches proceeding from the five or six upper ganglia, are of small size, and distributed to the aorta, oesophagus, vertebral column, and lungs. The branches to the lungs proceed from the third and fourth ganglia, and go to join the posterior pulmonary plexus. The visceral branches of the six lower ganglia unite to form the three splanchnic nerves. The Great splanchnic nerve proceeds from the sixth dorsal gan- glioD, and receiving the branches of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, passes downwards along the front of the vertebral column, and, piercing the crus of the diaphragm, terminates in the semi- lunar ganglion.ABDOMINAL PLEXUSES. 535 The Lesser splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments which issue from the tenth and eleventh ganglia ; it pierces the crus of the dia- phragm, and joins the solar plexus near the middle line. The Third or renal splanchnic nerve proceeds from the last thoracic ganglion, and, piercing the diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus. When absent, the place of this nerve is supplied by the lesser splanchnic. The Semilunar ganglion is a large, irregular, gangliform body, pierced by numerous openings, and appearing like the aggregation of a number of smaller ganglia, having spaces between them. It is situated by the side of the cceliac axis and root of the superior mesenteric artery, and extends outwards to the supra-renal capsule. The ganglia communicate both above and below the coeliac axis and form a gangliform circle, from which branches pass off in all direc- tions, like rays from a centre. Hence the entire circle has been named the solar plexus. The Solar or epigastric plexus receives the great and lesser splanchnic nerves ; the termination of the right pneumogastric nerve; some filaments from the right phrenic nerve; and sometimes one or two from the left. It sends forth numerous filaments which accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches given off by the abdominal aorta. Thus we have, derived from the solar plexus, the— Phrenic, or diaphragmatic Renal plexuses, Supra-renal plexuses, In connexion with the phrenic plexus of the right side, there is described a small ganglion diaphragmaticum, which is situated near the supra-renal capsule. In this ganglion branches of the right phrenic nerve communicate with those of the sympathetic. The Supra-renal plexuses are remarkable for their large size, and for a ganglion, which has received the name of ganglion supra- renale. The Renal plexuses are large, and receive the third splanchnic nerve. The Superior mesenteric plexus has several small ganglia at the root of the artery ; and its nerves, which are whiter than those of the other plexuses, form a kind of nervous sheath to the artery and its branches. The Aortic plexus is a continuation of the solar plexus down- wards on the aorta, for the supply of the inferior branches of that trunk ; it receives also branches from the renal plexuses and lumbar ganglia. It is the source of origin of the inferior mesenteric plexus plexuses, Superior mesenteric plexus, Aortic plexus, Spermatic plexuses, Inferior mesenteric plexus. Gastric plexus, Hepatic plexus, Splenic plexus,HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS. 536 and part of the spermatic plexus, and terminates below in the hypogastric plexus. It likewise distributes branches on the inferior vena cava. The Spermatic plexus is derived from the renal plexus, but re- ceives filaments from the aortic plexus. The Inferior mesenteric plexus is derived chiefly from the aortic plexus. LUMBAR PORTION OP THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The lumbar portion of the trunk of the sympathetic is situated on the vertebral column, close to the anterior border of the psoas magnus muscle. It is continuous above, under the edge of the diaphragm, with the thoracic portion of the nerve, and below it descends upon the sacrum, in front of the anterior sacral foramina, to the coccyx. It presents four small ganglia and an intermediate cord. The Lumbar ganglia, four in number at each side, of a pearly grey colour and fusiform shape, are situated on the anterior part of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. The branches of the lumbar ganglia are branches of communica- tion and branches of distribution. The external or communicating branches, two or three in number from each ganglion, and longer than in the other regions, commu- nicate with the lumbar nerves. The internal or visceral branches consist of two sets; the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and join the aortic plexus; the lower cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric plexus is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral portions, inferior hypogastric plexuses, which communicate with branches from the third and fourth sacral nerves. It distri- butes branches to the viscera of the pelvis, and sends filaments which accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. SACRAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The Sacral ganglia are four or five in number at each side. They are situated on the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connexion, although much smaller in size. The external or communicating branches are two from each ganglion, which pass outwards to communicate with the anterior sacral nerves and with the coccygeal nerve. The internal or visceral branches communicate very freely with537 SACRAL GANGLIA. the inferior hypogastric plexuses, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos. This ganglion serves to connect the extremities of the two sympathetic nerves. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum; and communicates with the coccygeal nerve. \538 CHAPTEK IX. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense, the instruments by which the animal frame is brought into relation with surrounding nature, are five in num- ber. Four of these organs are situated within the head ; viz., the apparatus of smell, sight, hearing, and taste; the remaining organ, that of touch, is resident in the skin, and distributed over the surface of the body. THE NOSE AND NASAL FOSS^J. The organ of smell consists essentially of two parts : one external, the nose; the other internal, the nasal fossae. The nose is the triangular pyramid which projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Superiorly it is con- nected with the forehead by means of a narrow bridge; inferiorly, it presents two openings, the nostrils, which overhang the mouth, and are so constructed that the odour of all substances must be received by the nose before they can be introduced within the lips. The septum between the openings of the nostrils is called the columna. Their entrance is guarded by a number of stiff hairs (vibrissas) which project across the openings, and act as a filter in preventing the introduction of foreign substances, such as dust or insects, with the current of air intended for respiration. The anatomical elements of which the nose is composed, are, 1. Integument. 2. Muscles. 3. Bones. 4. Fibro-cartilages. 5. Mucous membrane. 6. Vessels and nerves. 1. The Integument forming the tip (lobulus) and wings {alw) of the nose is extremely thick and dense, so as to be with difficulty separated from the fibro-cartilage. It is furnished with an abun- dance of sebiparous glands, which, by their oily secretion, protect the extremity of the nose under alternations of temperature. The sebaceous matter of these glands becomes of a dark colour near the surface, from altered secretion, and also from attraction of the car- bonaceous matter floating in the atmosphere; hence the spotted appearance which the tip of the nose presents in large cities. When the integument is firmly compressed, the inspissated sebaceous539 CARTILAGES OF THE NOSE. secretion is squeezed out, and taking the cylindrical form of the excretory ducts of the glands, has the appearance of small white maggots (grubs; comedones) with black heads. 2. The Muscles are brought into view by reflecting the integu- ment ; they are the pyramidalis nasi, compressor naris, dilatator naris, levator labii sirperioris alasque nasi, and depressor alas nasi. They have been already described with the muscles of the face. 3. The Bones of the nose are, the nasal, and nasal processes of the superior maxillary. 4. The Fibro-cartilages give form and stability to the nose, pro- viding, at the same time, by their elasticity, against injuries. They are five in number, namely, the— Fibro-cartilage of the septum, Two lateral fibro-cartilages, Two alar fibro-cartilages. The Fibro-cartilage of the septum, somewhat triangular in form, divides the nose into its two nostrils. It is connected above with the nasal bones and lateral fibro-cartilages; behind, with the ethmoidal septum and vomer ; and below, with the palate processes of the superior maxillary bones. The alar fibro-cartilages and columna move freely on the fibro-cartilage of the septum, being but loosely connected with it by perichondrium. Fig. 202 * The Lateral fibro-cartilages are also triangular; they are connected, in front, with the fibro-cartilage of the septum; above, with the nasal bones; behind, with the nasal pro- cesses of the superior maxillary bones; and below, with the alar fibro-cartilages. Alar fibro-cartilages.—Each of these cartilages is curved so as to correspond with the walls of the nostril, to which it forms a kind of rim. The inner portion is loosely connected with the same part of the opposite cartilage, to form the columna. It is expanded and thickened at the point of the nose, to constitute the lobe; and on the side makes a curve corresponding with that of the ala. This curve * The fibro-cartilages of the nose. 1.

The nostril.540 NASAL FOSSAE. is prolonged backwards and downwards in the direction of the terior border of the ala by three or four small fibro-cartilagh plates (sesamoid cartilages, cartilagines ininores), which are pendages of the alar fibro-cartilage. Its Nerves are, the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasal fossce are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded superiorly by the lateral cartilages of the nose, and by the nasal bones, ethmoid, and sphenoid ; inferiorly, by the hard palate; and, in the middle line, they are separated by a bony and fibro-cartila- ginous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossse will be found at page 65. On the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three projecting processes, termed spongy bones. The two superior belong to the ethmoid, the inferior is a separate bone. In the * The fibro-cartilages and bones of the nose viewed from the side; after Arnold. 1. Nasal bone. 2.

The space intervening between the superior and middle spongy bone is the superior meatus ; the space between the middle and inferior the middle meatus; and that between the inferior and the floor of the fossa the inferior meatus. These meatuses are passages which extend from before backwards, and it is in circulating through and amongst them that the atmo- sphere deposits its odorant particles upon the mucous membrane. There are several openings into the nasal fossse: thus, in the superior meatus are the openings of the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal cells ; in the middle, the anterior ethmoidal cells, frontal sinuses, and antrum maxillare ; and, in the inferior meatus, the termination of the nasal duct. In the dried bone there are two additional openings, the spheno-palatine and the anterior palatine foramen ; the former being situated in the superior, the latter in the inferior meatus. The Mucous membrane of the nasal fossa? is called pituitary, or Schneiderian* The former name being derived from the nature of its secretion, the latter from Schneider, who was the first to show that the secretion of the nose proceeded from the mucous membrane, and not from the brain, as was previously imagined. It is closely adherent to the periosteum, constituting what is called a fibro- mucous membrane, and is continuous with the general gastro-pul- monary mucous membrane. From the nasal fossa? it may be traced through the openings in the meatuses, into the sphenoidal and eth- moidal cells ; into the frontal sinuses ; into the antrum maxiJlare ; through the nasal duct to the surface of the eye, where it is con- tinuous with the conjunctiva ; along the Eustachian tubes into the tympanum and mastoid cells, to which it forms the lining mem- brane ; and through the posterior nares into the pharynx and mouth, and thence through the lungs and alimentary canal. The surface of the membrane is furnished with a laminated epithelium near the apertures of the nares, and in the rest of its extent with a columnar epithelium supporting vi bra tile cilia. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the nasal fossa? are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic ; and spheno- palatine and pterygo-palatine from the internal maxillary. The Nerves are, olfactory, spheno-palatine and naso-palatine from Meckel's ganglion, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The ulti- mate filaments of the olfactory nerve terminate in papilla?. * Conrad Victor Schneider, Professor of Medicine at Wittenberg. His^ work, entitled " De Catarrhis," &c, was published in 1661.542 ORGAN OF VISION. The form of the eyeball is that of a sphere, of about one inch in diameter, having the segment of a smaller sphere engrafted on its anterior surface, which increases its antero-posterior diameter. The axes of the two eyeballs are parallel with each other, but not so with the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the orbits, and therefore enter the eyeballs at their nasal side. The globe of the eye is composed of tunics, and of refracting media called humours. The tunics are three in number, 1. Sclerotic and Cornea, 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary processes, 3. Retina and Zonula ciliaris. The humours are also three— Aqueous, Crystalline (lens), Vitreous. First tunic.—The Sclerotic and Cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball, and give it its peculiar form. Four-fifths of the globe are invested by the sclerotic, the remaining fifth by the cornea. The Sclerotic (<TK\y)pbs, hard) is a dense fibrous membrane, thicker behind than in front. It is continuous, posteriorly, with the sheath of the optic nerve derived from the dura mater, and is pierced by that nerve as well as by the ciliary nerves and arteries. Anteriorly it presents a bevelled edge, which receives the cornea as a watch- glass is received by the groove of its case. Its anterior surface is covered by a thin tendinous layer, the tunica albuginea, derived from the expansion of the tendons of the four recti muscles ; and by its posterior surface it gives attachment to the two oblique muscles. The tunica albuginea is covered, for part of its extent, by the mucous membrane of the front of the eye, the conjunctiva ; and, by reason of the brilliancy of its whiteness, gives occasion to the common expression, "the white of the eye." At the entrance of the optic nerve, the sclerotic forms a thin cribriform lamella (lamina cribrosa), which is pierced by a number of minute openings for the passage of the nervous filaments. One of these openings, larger than the rest, and situated in the centre of the lamella, is the porus M>ticus} through which the arteria centralis retinae enters the%£ePtll. The Cornea (corneus, horny) is the transparent prominent layer which constitutes the anterior fifth of the globe of the eye. In its form it is circular, concavo-convex, and resembles a watch-glass. Its is received by its edge, which is sharp and thin, within the bevelledSCLEROTIC.—CORNEA. 543 border of the sclerotic, to which it is very firmly attached, and it is somewhat thicker than the anterior portion of that tunic. When examined from the exterior, its vertical diameter is seen to be about one-sixteenth shorter than the transverse, in consequence of the overlapping above and below of the margin of the sclerotica ; on the interior, however, its outline is perfectly circular. The cornea is composed of four layers : namely, the conjunctiva ; the cornea propria, which consists of several thin lamellae connected together by an extremely fine areolar tissue ; the cornea elastica, a " fine, elastic, and exquisitely transparent membrane, exactly applied to the inner surface of the cornea proper" ; and the lining membrane of the anterior chamber of the eyeball. The cornea elastica is Fig. 204.* remarkable for its perfect transparency, even when submitted for many days to the action of water or alcohol; while the cornea propria * Longitudinal section of the globe of the eye. 1.

To expose this mem- brane, Dr. Jacob suggests that the eye should be placed in water for six or eight days, and then, that all the opaque cornea should be removed layer by layer. Another character of the cornea elastica is its great elasticity, which causes it to roll up when divided or torn, in the same manner as the capsule of the lens. The use of this layer, according to Dr. Jacob, is to "preserve the requisite permanent correct curvature of the flaccid cornea proper." The opacity of the cornea, produced by pressure on the globe, results from the infiltration of fluid into the areolar tissue connect- ing its layers. This appearance cannot be produced in a sound living eye, although a small quantity of serous fluid (liquor corneas) is said to occupy the spaces of the areolar tissue. Dissection.—The sclerotic and cornea are now to be dissected away from the second tunic ; this, with care, may be easily performed, the only firm connexions subsisting between them being at the circum- ference of the iris, the entrance of the optic nerve, and the perfora- tion of the ciliary nerves and arteries. Pinch up a fold of the sclerotic near its anterior circumference, make a small opening through it, then raise the edge of the tunic, and with a pair of fine blunt-pointed scissors, divide the entire circumference of the scle- rotic, and cut it away bit by bit. Then separate it from its attach- ment around the circumference of the iris by a gentle pressure with the edge of the knife. The dissection of the eye must be conducted under water. In the course of this dissection, the ciliary nerves and long ciliary arteries will be seen passing forward between the sclerotic and choroid, to be distributed to the iris. Second tunic.—The second tunic of the eyeball is formed by the choroid, ciliary ligament, and iris ; the ciliary processes being an appendage developed from its inner surface. The Choroid* is a vascular membrane of a rich chocolate brown colour upon its external surface, and of a deep black colour within. It is connected to the sclerotic externally, by an extremely fine areolar tissue (membrana fusca), and by nerves and vessels. Inter- nally it is in simple contact with the third tunic of the eye, the retina. It is pierced posteriorly for the passage of the optic nerve, and is connected anteriorly with the iris, ciliary processes, and the * The word choroid, has been very much abused in anatomical language; it was originally applied to the membrane of the foetus called chorion, from the Greek word x°Pt0I/> domieilium, that membrane being, as it were, the abode or receptacle of the foetus. Xoptov comes from xwP«°> to take or re- ceive. Now, the chorion in the ovum is a vascular membrane of peculiar structure. Hence the term choroid, x»ptov ei-Sos, like the chorion, has been used to signify vascular structures, as the choroid membrane of the eye, the choroid plexus, &c, and we find Cruveilhier, in his work on Anatomy, vol. iii. p. 463, saying in a note, " Choroide est synonyme de vasculeuse."CHOROID COAT. 545 line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, by a dense white struc- ture, the ciliary ligament, which surrounds the circumference of the iris like a ring. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers :—an external or venous layer, which consists principally of veins arranged in a peculiar manner : hence they have been named venos vorticosce. The marking on the surface of the membrane produced by these veins resembles so many centres to which a number of curved lines converge. It is this layer which is connected with the ciliary liga- ment. The middle or arterial layer (tunica Ruyschiana)* is formed principally by the ramifications of minute arteries. It is reflected inwards at its junction with the ciliary ligament, so as to form the ciliary processes. The internal layer is a delicate membrane (membrana pigmenti) composed of several laminae of nucleated 3 hexagonal cells, which contain the granules of pigmentum nigrum, and are arranged like the tiles of a tesselated pavement. * Kuysch was bom at the Hague in 1638, and was appointed Professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665. His whole life was employed in making in- jected preparations, for which he is justly celebrated, and he died at the advanced age of ninety-three years; having come to the conclusion that the body was entirely made up of vessels. t Dissection of the eyeball, showing its second tunic, and the mode of dis- tribution of the venae vorticosa? of the choroid; after Arnold.

N NIRIS.—CILIARY PROCESSES. 546 In animals, the pigmentum nigrum of the posterior wall of the eyeball, is replaced by a layer of considerable extent, and of metallic brilliancy, called the tapetum. The Ciliary ligament, or circle (annulus albidus), is the bond of union between the external and middle tunic of the eyeball, and serves to connect the cornea and sclerotic, at their line of junction, with the iris and external layer of the choroid. It is also the point to which the ciliary nerves and vessels proceed previously to their distribution, and it receives the anterior ciliary arteries through the anterior margin of the sclerotic. A minute vascular canal is situ- ated within the ciliary ligament, called the ciliary canal, or canal of F on tana,* after its discoverer. The Iris (iris, a rainbow) is so named from its variety of colour in different individuals : it forms a septum between the anterior and posterior chamber of the eye, and is pierced somewhat to the nasal side of its centre by a circular opening, which is called the pupil. By its periphery it is connected with the ciliary ligament, and by its inner circumference forms the margin of the pupil; its * anterior surface looks towards the cornea, the posterior towards the ciliary processes and lens. The iris is composed of two layers, an anterior or muscular layer, consisting of ra- Fig. 206.f diating fibres which converge from the cir- cumference towards the centre, and have the power of dilating the pupil; and circular fibres, which surround the pupil like a sphinc- ter, and by their action produce contraction of its area. The posterior layer is of a deep purple tint, and is thence named uvea, from its resemblance in colour to a ripe grape. The Ciliary processes (corpus ciliare) may be seen in two ways, either * Felix Fontana, an anatomist of Tuscany.

They consist of a number of triangular folds, formed apparently by the plaiting of the middle and internal layer of the choroid. According to Zinn, they are about sixty in number, and may be divided into large and small, the latter being situated in the spaces between the former. Their periphery is connected with the ciliary ligament, and is continuous with the middle and internal layer of the choroid. The central border is free, and rests against the cir- cumference of the tens. The anterior surface corresponds with the uvea ; the posterior receives the folds of the zonula ciliaris between its processes, and thus establishes a connexion between the choroid and the third tunic of the eye. The ciliary processes are covered with a thick layer of pigmentum nigrum, which is more abundant on them and the anterior part of the choroid, than at the posterior part of the latter. When the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish colour. Third tunic.—The third tunic of the eye is the retina, which is prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. Dissection.—If, after the preceding dissection, the choroid mem- brane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina may be seen very distinctly. The Retina is composed of three layers :— External, or Jacob's membrane, Middle, Nervous membrane, Internal, Vascular membrane. Jacob's membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a mere film when the freshly dissected eye is suspended in water. Examined by the microscope, it is found to be composed of cells having a tes- selated arrangement. Dr. Jacob considers it to be a serous membrane. The Nervous membrane is the expansion of the optic nerve, and forms a thin semi-transparent bluish-white layer, which envelopes the vitreous humour, and extends forward to the commencement of the ciliary processes, where it terminates by an abrupt scalloped margin. According to Treviranus, this layer is composed of cylin- drical fibres, which proceed from the optic nerve, and, near their termination, bend abruptly inwards, to form the internal papillary layer, which lies in contact with the hyaloid membrane ; each fibre constituting by its extremity a distinct papilla. The Vascular membrane consists of the ramifications of a minute artery, arteria centralis retinae, and its accompanying vein ; the artery pierces the optic nerve, and enters the globe of the eye through the porus opticus, in the centre of the lamina cribrosa. N N 2ZONULA CILIABIS. 548 This artery may be seen by making a transverse section of the eye- ball. Its branches are continued anteriorly into the zonula ciliaris. The vascular layer forms distinct sheaths for the nervous papillae, which constitute the inner surface of the retina. In the centre of the Fig. 207.* posterior part of the globe of the eye, the retina presents a circular spot, which is called the fora- men of Soemmering ;f it is surrounded by a yellow halo, the limbus luteus, and is frequently obscured by an elliptical fold of the retina, which has been regarded as a normal condition of the membrane. The term foramen is misapplied to this spot, for the vascu- lar layer and the mem- brana Jacobi are conti- nued across it ; the ner- vous substance alone appearing to be deficient. It exists only in animals having the axes of the eyeballs parallel with each other, as man, quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles, and is said to give passage to a small lymphatic vessel. The Zonula ciliaris (zonula of Zinn)J is a thin vascular layer, which connects the anterior margin of the retina with the anterior surface of the lens, near its circumference. It presents at its sur- face a number of small folds corresponding with the ciliary pro- cesses, between which they are received. These processes are arranged in the form of rays around the lens, and the spaces be- tween them are stained by the pigmentum nigrum of the ciliary processes ; they derive their vessels from the vascular layer of the * Posterior segment of a transverse section of the globe of the eye, seen from within. 1.

The under surface of the zonula is in contact with the hya- loid membrane, and around the lens forms the anterior fluted wall of the canal of Petit. The connexion between these folds and the ciliary processes may be demonstrated by dividing an eye transversely into two portions, then raising the anterior half, and allowing the vitreous humour to separate from its attachment by its own weight. The folds of the zonula will be seen to be drawn out from between the folds of the ciliary processes. Humours.—The Aqueous humour is situated in the anterior and posterior chamber of the eye ; it is a weakly albuminous fluid, with an alkaline reaction, and a specific gravity very little greater than that of distilled water. According to Petit, it scarcely exceeds four or five grains in weight. The anterior chamber is the space intervening between the cornea in front, and the iris and pupil behind. The posterior chamber is the narrow space less than half a line in depth,* bounded by the posterior surface of the iris and pupil in front, and by the ciliary processes, zonula ciliaris, and lens behind. The two chambers are lined by a thin layer, the secreting membrane of the aqueous humour. The Vitreous humour forms the principal bulk of the globe of the eye. It is an albuminous and highly transparent fluid, enclosed in a delicate membrane, the hyaloid. From the inner surface of this membrane, numerous thin lamellze are directed inwards, and form compartments in which the fluid is contained. According to Hannover, these lamellae have a radiated arrangement, like those of the transverse section of an orange, and are about 180 in num- ber. In the centre of the vitreous humour is a tubular canal, through which a minute artery is conducted from the arteria cen- tralis retinae to the capsule of the lens. This vessel is injected without difficulty in the foetus. The Crystalline humour or lens is situated immediately behind the pupil, and surrounded by the ciliary processes, which slightly overlap its margin. It is more convex on the posterior than on the anterior surface, and is embedded in the anterior part of the vitre- ous humour, from which it is separated by the hyaloid membrane. It is invested by a peculiarly transparent and elastic membrane, the capsule of the lens, which contains a small quantity of fluid called liquor Morgagni^ and is retained in its place by the attachment of the zonula ciliaris. Dr. Jacob is of opinion that the lens is con- * Winslow and Lieutaud thought the iris to be in contact with the lens; it frequently adheres to the capsule of the latter in iritis. The depth of the posterior chamber is greater in old than in young persons. t John Baptist Morgagni was born in 1682. He was appointed Professor of Medicine in Bologna, and published the first part of his "Adversaria Ana- tomica," in 1706. He died in 1771.550 STRUCTURE OP THE LENS. nected to its capsule by means of areolar tissue, and that the liquor Morgagni is the result of a cadaveric change. The lens consists of concentric layers, of which the external are soft, the next firmer, and the central form a hardened nucleus. They are best demonstrated by boiling, or by immersion in alcohol, when they separate easily from each other. Another division of the lens takes place at the same time : it splits into three triangu- lar segments, having the sharp edge directed towards the centre, and the base towards the circumference. The concentric lamellae are composed of minute parallel fibres, united with each other by means of scalloped borders, the convexity of one border fitting the concave scallop of the other. Immediately around the circumference of the lens is a triangular canal, the canal of Petit * about a line and a half in breadth. It is bounded, in front, by the flutings of the zonula ciliaris ; behind, by the hyaloid membrane; and within, by the border of the lens. Vessels and nerves.—The Vessels of the globe of the eye are the long, short, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria cen- tralis retinae. The lomg ciliary arteries, two in number, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and pass forward on each side, be- tween that membrane and the choroid, to the ciliary ligament, where each divides into two branches, which are distributed to the iris. The short ciliary arteries pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic coat, and are distributed to the middle layer of the choroid membrane. The anterior ciliary are branches of the muscular arteries. They enter the eye through the anterior part of the scle- rotic, and are distributed to the iris. It is the increased number of these latter arteries, in iritis, that gives rise to the peculiar red zone around the circumference of the cornea. The A rteria centralis retina? enters the optic nerve at about half an inch from the globe of the eye, and passing through the porus opticus, is distributed on the inner surface of the retina, forming its vascular layer; one branch pierces the centre of the vitreous humour, and supplies the capsule of the lens. The Nerves of the eyeball are, the optic, two ciliary nerves from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the ciliary nerves from the ophthalmic ganglion. Observations.—The sclerotic is a tunic of protection, and the cornea a medium for the transmission of light. The choroid sup- ports the vessels destined for the nutrition of the eye, and by its pigmentum nigrum absorbs all scattered rays that might confuse the image impressed on the retina. The iris, by means of its powers of expansion and contraction, regulates the quantity of light * John Louis Petit, a celebrated French surgeon : he published several sur- gical and anatomical Essays, in the early part of the 18th century. He died in 1750.APPENDAGES OP THE EYE. 551 admitted through the pupil. If the iris be thin, and the rays of light pass through its substance, they are absorbed by the uvea ; and if that layer be insufficient, they are taken up by the black pigment of the ciliary processes. In Albinoes, where there is an absence of pigmentuin nigrum, the rays of light traverse the iris, and even the sclerotic, and so overwhelm the eye with light, that sight is destroyed, except in the dimness of evening or at night. In the manufacture of optical instruments, care is taken to colour their inteilor black, with the same object, the absorption of scattered rays. The transparent lamellated cornea and the humours of the eye have for their office the refraction of the rays in such proportion as to direct the image in the most favourable manner upon the retina. Where the refracting medium is too great, as in over convexity of the cornea and lens, the image falls short of the retina (myopia, near-sightedness) ; and where it is too little, the image is thrown beyond the nervous membrane (presbyopia, far-sightedness). These conditions are rectified by the use of spectacles, which provide a differently refracting medium externally to the eye, and thereby correct the transmission of light. APPENDAGES OP THE EYE. The Appendages of the Eye (tutamina oculi) are, the eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, caruncula lachrymalis, and the lachrymal apparatus. The Eyebroivs (supercilia) are two prominent arches of integu- ment covered with short thick hairs, which form the upper boundary of the orbits. They are connected beneath with the orbiculares, occipito-frontales, and corrugatores superciliorum muscles; their use is to shade the eyes from too vivid a light, or protect them from particles of dust and moisture rolling down the forehead. The Eyelids (palpebral) are two valvular layers placed in front of the eye, serving to defend it from injury by their closure. When drawn open, they leave between them an elliptical space (fissura palpebrarum), the angles of which are called canthi. The outer canthus is formed by the meeting of the two lids at an acute angle. The inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance inwards towards the nose, and a triangular space is left between the lids in this situation, which is called the lacus lachrymalis. At the commence- ment of the lacus lachrymalis upon each of the two lids is a small angular projection, the lachrymal papilla or tubercle; and at the apex of each papilla a small orifice (punctum lachrymale), the com- mencement of the lachrymal canal. The eyelids have, entering into their structure, integument, orbi- cularis muscle, tarsal cartilages, Meibomian glands, and con- junctiva. The tegumentary areolar tissue of the eyelids is remarkable for552 MEIBOMIAN GLANDS. its looseness and absence of adipose substance; it is particularly- liable to serous infiltration. The fibres of that portion (palpebralis) of the orbicularis muscle which covers the eyelids are thin and pale. The Tarsal cartilages are two thin lamellae of fibro-cartilage about an inch in length, which give form and support to the eyelids. The superior is of a semi- Fig. 208.* lunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at its middle, and tapering to each extremity. Its lower border is broad and flat, its upper thin and gives attachment to the levator palpebrse and to the fibrous membrane of the lids. The Inferior Hbro-carti- lage is an elliptical band, narrower than the superior, and situated in the sub- stance of the lower lid. Its upper border is flat, and corresponds with the flat edge of the upper cartilage. The lower is held in its place by the fibrous membrane. Near the inner canthus, the tarsal cartilages terminate, at the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, and are attached to the margin of the orbit by the tendo oculi. At their outer extremity they terminate at a short distance from the angle of the canthus, and are retained in position by means of a decussation of the fibrous structure of the broad tarsal ligament, called the external palpebral or external tarsal ligament. The Fibrous membrane of the lids is firmly attached to the peri- osteum, around the margin of the orbit, by its circumference, and to the tarsal cartilages by its central margin. It is thick and dense for the outer half of the orbit, but becomes thin to its inner side. Its use is to retain the tarsal cartilages in their place and give sup- port to the lids ; hence it is named the broad tarsal ligament. The Meibomian glands^ are embedded in the substance of the cartilages, and are distinctly seen on examining the inner aspect * Appendages of the eye. 1. Superior tarsal cartilage. 2.

They have the appearance of parallel strings of pearls, about thirty in number in the upper cartilage, and somewhat fewer in the lower ; and open by minute foramina on the edges of the lids. They correspond in length with the breadth of the cartilage, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clustered glan- dular vesicles open ; the latter being so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out on the mar- gin of the lids. Occa- sionally an arch is form- ed between two of the follicles, and produces a graceful appearance. The edges of the eyelids are furnished with a triple row of long thick hairs, which curve upwards from the upper lid, and down- wards from the lower, so as not to interlace with each other in the closure of the eyelids, and prove an impediment to the opening of the eyes. These are the eye-lashes {cilia), important organs of defence to the sensitive surface of so delicate a structure as the eye. Their follicles are supplied with sebiparous glands like those of other hairs. The Conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It covers the whole of its anterior surface, and is then reflected upon the lids so as to form their internal layer. The duplicatures formed between the globe of the eye and the lids are called the superior and inferior palpebral sinuses, the former being deeper than the latter. Where it covers the cornea, the conjunctiva is thin and closely adherent, and no vessels can be traced into it. On the sclerotica it is thicker and less adherent, and on the inner surface of the lids is very closely connected, and exceedingly vascular. It is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane, and sympathizes in its affections, as may be observed in various diseases. From the surface of the eye it may be traced through the lachrymal ducts into * Meibomian glands, as seen upon the inner side of the eyelids; after Arnold. 1. Upper lid. 2. Lower lid. 3, 3.

The Caruncula lachrymalis is the small reddish body which occupies the lacus lachrymalis at the inner canthus of the eye. In health it presents a bright pink tint; in sickness it loses its colour, and becomes pale. It consists of an assemblage of follicles similar to the Meibomian glands, embedded in a fibrocartilaginous tissue, and is the source of the whitish secretion which so constantly forms at the inner angle of the eye. It is covered with minute hairs, which are sometimes so long as to be visible to the naked eye. Immediately to the outer side of the caruncula is a slight dupli- cature of the conjunctiva, called plica semilunaris, which contains a minute plate of cartilage, and is the rudiment of the third lid of animals, the membrana nictitans of birds. Vessels and Nerves.—The palpebrse are supplied internally with arteries from the ophthalmic, and externally from the facial aiid transverse facial. Their nerves are branches of the fifth and facial. LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. The Lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland with its excretory ducts ; the puncta lachrymalia and lachrymal canals ; the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. The Lachrymal gland is situated at the upper and outer angle of the orbit, and consists of two portions, orbital and palpebral. The orbital portion, about three-quarters of an inch in length, is flattened and oval in shape, and occupies the lachrymal fossa of the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It is in contact superiorly with the peri- osteum, with which it is closely connected by its upper and convex surface ; by its inferior or concave surface it is in relation with the globe of the eye, and the superior and external rectus ; and by its anterior border with the broad tarsal ligament. By its posterior border it receives its vessels. The palpebral portion, smaller than the preceding, is situated in the upper eyelid, extending downwards to the superior margin of the tarsal cartilage. It is connected with the orbital portion above, and is enclosed in an investment of dense fibrous membrane. The secretion of the lachrymal gland is con- veyed away by from eight to twelve small ducts which run for a short distance beneath the conjunctiva, and open on its surface by a series of pores, about one-twentieth of an inch apart, situated in a curved line a little above the upper border of the tarsal cartilage. Lachrymal canals.—The lachrymal canals commence at the minute openings, puncta lachrymalia, seen on the lachrymal papillae of the lids at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymalis, and proceed inwards to the lachrymal sac, where they terminate beneath555 ORGAN OP HEARING. a valvular semilunar fold of the lining membrane. The superior duct at first ascends, and then turns suddenly inwards towards the sac, forming an abrupt angle. The inferior duct forms the same kind of angle, by descending at first, and then turning abruptly inwards. They are dense and elastic in structure, and, being con- stantly open, act like capillary tubes in absorbing the tears from the surface of the eye. The two fasciculi of the tensor tarsi muscle are inserted into these ducts, and serve to draw them inwards. The Lachrymal sac is the upper extremity of the nasal duct, and is scarcely more dilated than the rest of the canal. It is lodged in the gi'oove of the lachrymal bone, and is often distinguished inter- nally, from the nasal duct, by a semilunar or circular valve. The sac consists of mucous membrane, but is covered in and retained in its place by a fibrous expansion, derived from the tendon of the orbicularis, which is inserted into the ridge of the lachrymal bone ; it is also covered by the tensor tarsi muscle, which arises from the same ridge, and in its action on the lachrymal canals makes pressure on the lachrymal sac. The Nasal duct is a short canal, about three-quarters of an inch in length, directed downwards, backwards, and a little outwards to the inferior meatus of the nose, where it terminates by an expanded orifice. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous with the conjunctiva above, and with the pituitary membrane of the nose below. Obstruction, from inflammation and suppuration of this duct, constitutes the disease termed fistula lachrymalis. Vessels and Nerves.—The lachrymal gland is supplied with blood by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery, and with nerves by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. ORGAN OF HEARING. The apparatus of hearing is composed of three parts, external ear, middle ear or tympanum, and internal ear or labyrinth. The External ear consists of two portions, the pinna and meatus ; the former representing a kind of funnel which collects the vibrations of the atmosphere producing sounds, and the latter a tube which conveys the vibrations to the tympanum. The Pinna presents a number of folds and hollows on its surface, which have different names assigned to them. Thus, the external folded margin is the helix a fold). The elevation parallel with and in front of the helix is the antihelix (clvtl, opposite). The pointed process, projecting like a valve over the opening of the ear, from the face, is the tragus (epdyos, a goat), probably from being sometimes covered with bristly hair like that of a goat ; and, a tubercle opposite this, is the antitragus. The lower dependent and fleshy portion of the pinna is the lobulus. The space between the helix and antihelix is named the fossa innominata (scaphoidea).556 MUSCLES OF THE PINNA. Another depression at the upper extremity of the antihelix, pro- duced by a bifurcation of that ridge, is the fossa triangularis (ovalis) ; and the large central space, to which all the channels con- verge, the concha, which opens directly into the meatus. The pinna is composed of integument, fibro-cartilage, ligaments, and muscles. The Integument is thin, contains an abundance of sebiparous glands and is closely connected with the fibro-cartilage. The Fibro-cartilage gives form to the pinna, and is folded so as to produce the various convexities and grooves which have been described on its surface. The helix begins in the concha, and par- tially divides that cavity into two parts; on its anterior border, where it commences its curve upwards, is a tubercle or spine, and a little above this a small vertical fissure, the fissure of the helix. The termination of the helix and antihelix forms a lengthened pro- cess, the processus caudatus, which is separated from the concha by an extensive fissure. On the anterior surface of the tragus is another fissure, the fissure of the tragus; and, in the lobulus, the fibro-cartilage is wanting. The fibro-cartilage of the meatus is divided from the concha by several fissures (fissures of Santorinus), and at the upper and anterior part of the cylinder is a considerable space, which is closed by muscular and ligamentous fibres; it is firmly attached at its termination to the processus auditorius. The Ligaments of the external ear are those which attach the pinna to the side of the head, viz., anterior, posterior, and ligament of the tragus ; and those of the fibro-cartilage, which serve to pre- serve its folds and connect the opposite margins of the fissures. The latter are two in number, the ligament between the concha and processus caudatus, and the broad ligament which extends from the upper margin of the fibro-cartilage of the tragus to the helix, and completes the meatus. The proper Muscles of the pinna are, the— Major helicis, Antitragicus, Minor helicis, Transversus auricula?, Tragicus, Obliquus auris, Dilatator conchse. The Major helicis is a narrowband of muscular fibres situated on the anterior border of the helix. It arises from the spine of the helix and is inserted into the anterior border of that fold. The Minor helicis is placed upon the anterior extremity (cms) of the helix, at its commencement in the fossa of the concha. The Tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situated on the tragus. The Antitragicus arises from the antitragus, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the processus caudatus of the helix.557 MEATUS AUDITORIUS. The Transversus auriculce, partly tendinous 'and partly muscular, extends transversely from the convexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the pinna. The Obliquus auris (Tod) is a small band of fibres passing be- tween the upper part of the convexity of the concha and the con- vexity immediately above it. The Dilatator concha? is a thin band of muscular fibres which crosses the fissure between the cartilage of the meatus and tragus on its anterior aspect. Todf describes, besides, a contractor meatus, or trago-helicus muscle. The Meatus auditoeius is a canal, partly cartilaginous and partly osseous, about an inch in length, which extends inwards and a little * The pinna and its muscles; after Arnold.' 1,1. Helix. 2.

It is narrower in the middle than at each extremity, forms an oval cylinder, the long diameter being vertical, and is slightly curved on itself, the con- cavity looking downwards. It is lined by an extremely thin pouch of epithe- lium, which, when withdrawn after maceration, pre- serves the form of the meatus. Some stiff short hairs are also found in its interior, which' stretch across the tube, and prevent the ingress of in- sects and dust. In the substance of its lining mem- brane are a num- ber of ceruminous glands, which se- crete the wax of the ear. Vessels & Nerves. The pinna is plen- tifully supplied with arteries ; by the anterior auri- cular from the temporal, by the posterior auricular from the ex- ternal carotid, and by a branch from the occipital artery. Its Nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal of the fifth, the posterior auricular of the facial, and the auricularis magnus of the cervical plexus. Middle ear or tympanum.—The tympanum is an irregular bony cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is bounded externally by the meatus and mem- brana tympani; internally, by the base of the petrous bone; behind, * The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind; after Arnold. 1,1.

The Membrana tympani is a thin and semi-transparent mem- brane of an oval shape, its long diameter being vertical. It is in- serted into a groove situated around the circumference of the meatus, near its termination, and is placed obliquely across the area of that tube, the direction of the obliquity being downwards and inwards. It is concave towards the meatus, convex towards the tympanum, and composed of three layers, external, or epithelial; * Diagram of the ear. p. Pinna, t. Tympanum. I. Labyrinth. 1.

The tympanum contains three small bones, ossicula auditHs, viz., the malleus, incus, and stapes. The Malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle (manu- brium), and two processes, long (processus gracilis), and short (processus brevis). The manubrium is connected with the mem- brana tympani by its whole length, extending below the central point of that membrane. It lies beneath the mucous layer of the membrane, and serves as a point of attachment to which the radi- ating fibres of the fibrous layer converge. The long process de- scends to a groove near the fissura Grlaseri, and gives attachment to the laxator tympani muscle. Into the short process is inserted the tendon of the tensor tympani; and the head of the bone articulates with the incus. The Incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resemblance to an anvil. It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer than, and widely separated from, the other. It consists of two processes, united nearly at right angles, and at their junc- tion forming a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus. The short process is attached to the margin of the opening of the mastoid cells by means of a ligament; the long process descends nearly parallel with the handle of the malleus, and curves inwards, near its termination. At its extremity is a small globular projec- tion, the os orbiculare, which in the foetus is a separate piece, but becomes anchylosed to the long process of the incus in the adult; this process articulates with the head of the stapes. The Stapes is shaped like a stirrup, to which it bears a close re- semblance. Its head articulates with the os orbiculare, and the two branches (crura) are connected by their extremities with a flat, oval-shaped plate, representing the foot of the stirrup. The foot of the stirrup is received into the fenestra ovalis, to the margin of which it is connected by means of a ligament; it is in contact, by its surface, with the membrana vestibuli, and is covered in by the mucous lining of the tympanum. The neck of the stapes gives attachment to the stapedius muscle. The ossicula auditus are retained in position and moved upon themselves by means of ligaments and muscles. The Ligaments are three in number ; the suspensory ligament of the malleus, which is attached by one extremity to the upper wall of the tympanum, and by the other to the head of the malleus ; the posterior ligament of the incus, a short and thick band, which serves to attach the extremity of the short process of that bone to the margin of the opening of the mastoid cells ; and the annular ligament which connects the margin of the foot of the stapes with the circumference of the fenestra ovalis. These ligaments have been described as muscles, by Tod, under the names of superior capitis mallei, obliquus incudis externus posterior, and musculusOPENINGS OF THE TYMPANUM. 561 vel structura stapedii inferior. Arnold adds as a fourth, a suspen- sory ligament of the incus. The Muscles of the tympanum are four in number, the— Tensor tympani, Laxator tympani minor, Laxator tympani, Stapedius. The Tensor tympani (musculus internus mallei) arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid, the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the Eustachian tube, and passes forwards in a distinct canal, separated from the tube by the processus cochleariformis, to be inserted into the handle of the malleus, immediately below the root of the processus gracilis. The Laxator tympani (musculus externus mallei) arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and passes through an opening in the fissura Grlaseri, to be inserted into the neck of the malleus, just above the root of the processus gracilis. This is re- garded as a ligament (anterior ligament of the malleus) by some The Laxator tympani minor (posterior ligament of the malleus) arises from the upper margin of the meatus, and is inserted into the handle and processus brevis of the malleus. This is regarded as a ligament by some anatomists. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and escapes from its summit to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. Foramina.—The openings in the tympanum are ten in number, five large and five small; they are— Large Openings. Small Openings. Meatus auditorius, Entrance of chorda tympani, Fenestra ovalis, Exit of chorda tympani, Fenestra rotunda, For the laxator tympani, Mastoid cells, For the tensor tympani, Eustachian tube. For the stapedius. The opening of the meatus auditorius has been already described. The Fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli) is a reniform opening, situated at the bottom of a small oval fossa (pelvis ovalis), in the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum, directly opposite the meatus. The long diameter of the fenestra is horizontal, and its convex borders directed upwards. It is the opening of commu- nication between the tympanum and vestibule, and is closed by the foot of the stapes and by the lining membrane of both cavities. The Fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae) is somewhat triangular in form, and situated in the inner wail of the tympanum, below o oWALLS OP THE TYMPANUM. 562 and rather posteriorly to the fenestra ovalis, from which it is sepa- rated by a bony elevation, called the promontory. It serves to establish a communication between the tympanum and cochlea. In the fresh subject it is closed by a proper membrane (m. tympani secundaria) as well as by the lining of both cavities. The Mastoid cells are numerous, and occupy the whole of the in- terior of the mastoid process and part of the petrous bone. They communicate by a large irregular opening with the upper and pos- terior circumference of the tympanum. The Eustachian tube is a short canal about an inch and three quarters in length, extending obliquely between the pharynx and the anterior circumference of the tympanum. In structure it is partly fibrocartilaginous and partly osseous, is broad and expanded at its pharyngeal extremity, and narrow and compressed at the tympanum. . The Smaller openings serve for the transmission of the chorda tympani nerve, and three of the muscles of the tympanum. The opening by which the chorda tympani enters the tympanum is at about the middle of its posterior wall, and near the root of the pyramid. The opening of exit for the chorda tympani is at the fissura Glaseri in the anterior wall of the tympanum. The opening for the laxator tympani muscle is also situated in the fissura Glaseri, in the anterior wall of the tympanum. The open- ing for the tensor tympani muscle is in the inner wall, immediately above the opening of the Eustachian tube. The opening for the stapedius muscle is at the apex of a conical bony eminence, the pyramid, which is situated on the posterior wall of the tympanum, immediately behind the fenestra ovalis. Directly above the fenestra ovalis is a rounded ridge formed by the projection of the aquosductus Fallopii. Beneath the fenestra ovalis and separating it from the fenestra rotunda is the pro- montory, a rounded prominence formed by the projection of the first turn of the cochlea. It is channeled on its surface by three small grooves, which lodge the three tympanic branches of Jacob- son's nerve. The Foramina and processes of the tympanum may be arranged according to their situation, into four groups. 1. In the External wall is the meatus auditorius, closed by the membrana tympani. 2. In the Inner wall, from above downwards, are the— Opening for the tensor tympani, Ridge of the aquseductus Fallopii, Fenestra ovalis, Promontory, with the grooves for Jacobson's nerve, Fenestra rotunda.563 INTERNAL EAR OR LABYRINTH. 3.

In the Anterior wall are the— Eustachian tube, Fissura Glaseri, Opening for laxator tympani, Apertura chorda? (exit). The tympanum is lined by a vascular mucous membrane, which invests the ossicula and chorda tympani, and forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani. From the tympanum it is reflected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout, and it passes through the Eustachian tube to become continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. In the Eustachian tube its epithelium is furnished with vibratile cilia. Vessels and Nerves. — The Arteries of the tympanum are derived from the internal maxillary, internal carotid, and posterior auricular. Its Nerves are—1. Minute branches from the facial, distributed to the stapedius muscle. 2. The chorda tympani, which leaves the facial nerve near the stylo-mastoid foramen, and arches upwards to enter the tympanum at the root of the pyramid; it then passes forwards between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to its proper opening in the fissura Glaseri. 3. The tym- panic branches of Jacobson's nerve, which are distributed to the membranes of the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda, and to the Eustachian tube, and form a plexus by communicating with the carotid plexus, otic ganglion, and Vidian nerve. 4. A filament from the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. Internal ear.—The Internal ear is called labyrinth, from the complexity of its communications ; it consists of a membranous and an osseous portion. The osseous labyrinth presents a series of cavities, which are channeled through the substance of the petrous bone, and is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the meatus auditorius internus. It is divisible into the— Vestibule, Semicircular canals, Cochlea. The Vestibule is a small three-cornered cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated immediately within the inner wall of the tympanum. The three corners, which are named ventricles or cornua, are placed, one anteriorly, one superiorly, and one posteriorly. The Anterior ventricle receives the oval aperture of the scala o o 2OPENINGS OP THE VESTIBULE. 564 vestibuli; the superior, the ampullary openings of the superior and horizontal semicircular canal ; the posterior, the ampullary opening of the oblique semicircular canal, the common aperture of the oblique and perpendicular canal, the termination of the horizontal canal, and the aperture of the aquseductus vestibuli. In the ante- rior ventricle is a small depression, which corresponds with the posterior segment of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius inter- num ; it is called the fovea hemispherica, and is pierced by a cluster of small openings, the macula cribrosa. In the superior ventricle of the vestibule is another small depression, the fovea elliptica, which is separated from the fovea hemispherica by a projecting crest, the eminentia pyramidalis. The latter is pierced by nume- rous minute openings for the passage of nervous filaments. The posterior ventricle presents a third small depression, the fovea sulciformis, which leads upwards to the ostium aquseductus vesti- buli. The internal voall of the vestibule corresponds with the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus, and is pierced by numerous small openings for the transmission of nervous filaments. In the external or tympanic wall is the reniform open- ing of the fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli), the margin of which presents a prominent rim towards the cavity of the vestibule. The openings of the vestibule may be arranged, like those of the tympanum, into large and small. The Large openings are seven in number : viz., the— Fenestra ovalis, Scala vestibuli, Five openings of the three semicircular canals. The Small openings are the— Aquseductus vestibuli, Openings for small arteries, Openings for filaments of the auditory nerve. The fenestra ovalis has already been described ; it is the opening from the tympanum. The opening of the scala vestibuli is the oval termination of the vestibular canal of the cochlea. The aquwductus vestibuli (canal of Cotunnius) is the commence- ment of the small canal which opens under the osseous scale on the posterior surface of the petrous bone. It gives passage to a small vein and to a process of membrane which is continuous internally with the lining membrane of the vestibule, and externally with the dura mater. The openings for arteries and nerves are situated in the internal wall of the vestibule, and correspond with the termination of the meatus auditorius internus. The Semicircular canals are three bony passages communi-SEMICIRCULAR CANALS. COCHLEA. 565 eating with, the vestibule, into which they open by both extremities. Near one extremity of each of the canals is a dilatation of its cavity, which is called the ampulla, sinus ampullaceus. The superior, or perpendicular canal (canalis semicircularis verticalis superior), is directed transversely across the petrous bone, forming a projection on the anterior face of the latter. It commences by means of an ampulla, in the superior ventricle of the vestibule, and terminates posteriorly by joining with the oblique, and forming a common canal, which opens into the upper part of the posterior ventricle. The middle or oblique canal (canalis semicircularis verticalis poste- rior) corresponds with the posterior part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it commences by an ampullary dilatation in the posterior ventricle, and curves nearly perpendicularly upwards to terminate in the common canal. In the ampulla of this canal are numerous minute openings for nervous filaments. The inferior or horizontal canal (canalis semicircularis horizontalis) is directed outwards, towards the base of the petrous bone, and is shorter than the two;preceding. It commences by an ampullary dilatation in the superior ventricle, and terminates in the posterior ventricle. The Cochlea (snail shell) forms the anterior portion of the laby- rinth, corresponding by its apex with the anterior wall of the petrous bone, and by its base with the anterior depression at the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus. It consists of an osseous and gradually tapering canal, about one inch and a half in length, which makes two turns and a half spirally around a central axis, called the modiolus. The central axis, or modiolus, is large near its base, where it corresponds with the first turn of the cochlea, and diminishes in diameter towards its extremity. At its base, it is pierced by numerous minute openings, which transmit the filaments of the cochlear nerve. These openings are disposed in a spiral manner ; hence they have received, from Cotunnius,* the name of tractus spiralis forarninulentus. The modiolus is everywhere traversed, in the direction of its length, by minute canals, which proceed from the tractus spiralis forarninulentus, and terminate on the sides of the modiolus, by opening into the canal of the cochlea or on the surface of its lamina spiralis. The central canal of the tractus spiralis forarninulentus is larger than the rest, and is named the tubulus centralis modioli ; it is continued onwards to the extremity of the modiolus, and transmits a nerve and small artery (arteria centralis modioli). The interior of the canal of the cochlea is partially divided into two passages (scalse) by means of a thin and porous lamina of bone (zonula ossea laminae spiralis), which is wound spirally around the * Dominieo Cotunnius, an Italian physician; his dissertation "De Aquse- ductibus Auris Humana?

The osseous lamina spi- ralis consists of two thin lamellae, between which, and through the perforations on their surfaces, the fila- ments of the cochlear nerve reach the mem- brane of the cochlea. At the apex of the cochlea, the lamina spiralis terminates by a pointed, hook-shaped process, the hamulus laminae spiralis. The two scalae of the cochlea, which are completely separated through- out their length in the living ear, communicate superiorly, over the hamulus laminae spiralis, by means of an opening common to both, the helico-trema eXtcrcrw, volvere—rpij/na). Inferiorly, one of the two scalae, the scala vestibuli, terminates by means of an oval aperture in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule ; while the other, the scala tympani, becomes somewhat expanded, and opens into the tympanum through the fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae). Near the termination of the scala tympani is the small opening of the aquaeductus cochleae. The internal surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by &fibro- serous membrane, which is analogous to the dura mater in per- forming the office of a periosteum by its exterior, whilst it fulfils the * The cochlea divided parallel with its axis, through the centre of the modiolus; after Breschet. 1.

These processes are the remains of a communication originally subsisting between the dura mater and the cavity of the labyrinth. * The Membranous labyrinth is smaller in size, but a perfect counterpart with respect to form, of the vestibule and semicircular canals. It consists of a small elongated sac, sacculus communis (utriculus communis) : of three semicircular membranous canals, which correspond with the osseous canals, and communicate with the sacculus communis ; and of a small round sac (sacculus pro- prius), which occupies the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and lies in close contact with the external surface of the sacculus com- munis. The membranous semicircular canals are two-thirds smaller in diameter than the osseous canals. The membranous labyrinth is retained in position by means of the numerous nervous filaments which are distributed to it from the openings in the inner wall of the vestibule, and is separated from the lining membrane of the labyrinth by the aqua labyrinthi. In structure it is composed of four layers ; an external or serous layer, derived from the lining membrane of the labyrinth ; a vas- cular layer, in which an abundance of minute vessels are distri- buted ; a nervous layer, formed by the expansion of the filaments of the vestibular nerve ; and an internal and serous membrane, by which the limpid fluid which fills its interior is secreted. Some patches of pigment have been observed by Wharton Jones in the tissue of the membranous labyrinth of man. Among animals such spots are constant. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a limpid fluid, the liquor Scarpaef (endolymph, vitreous humour of the ear), and con- tains two small calcareous masses, called otoconites. The otoconites (ods, <hrbs, nbvis, ear-dust) consist of an assemblage of minute crystalline particles of carbonate and phosphate of lime, held together by organic substance, and probably retained in form by a reflection of the lining membrane of the membranous labyrinth. They are found suspended in the liquor Scarpas; one in the sacculus communis, the other in the sacculus proprius, from that part of each sac with which the nerves are connected. * Cotunnius regarded these processes as tubular canals, through which the superabundant aqua labyrinthi might be expelled into the cavity of the cranium. Wharton Jones also describes them as tubular canals terminating beneath the dura mater of the petrous bone in a small dilated pouch. In the ear of a man deaf and dumb from birth, he found the termination of the aqueduct of the vestibule of unusually large size in consequence of irregular development. f Antonio Scarpa is celebrated for several admirable surgical and anatomical monographs; as, for example, his work on " Aneurism," " De Auditu et Olfactu," &c. An account of the aqua labyrinthi will be found in his anatomical observations " De Structura Fenestra? Rotunda?, et de Tympano Secundario."569 ORGAN OF TASTE. The Auditory nerve divides into two branches at the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus ; a vestibular nerve and a cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve, the posterior of the two, separates into three branches, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch gives off a number of filaments which pass through the minute openings of the eminentia pyrami- dalis and superior ventricle of the vestibule, and are distributed to the sacculus communis and ampullae of the perpendicular and horizontal semicircular canal. The middle vestibular branch sends off numerous filaments, which pass through the openings of the macula cribrosa in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and are distributed to the sacculus proprius. The inferior and smallest branch takes its course backwards to the posterior wall of the vestibule, and gives off filaments which pierce the wall of the am- pullary dilatation of the oblique canal to be distributed upon its ampulla. According to Stiefensand, there is in the situation of the point of entrance of the nervous filaments into the ampulla a deep depression on the exterior of the membrane, and on the in- terior a corresponding projection, which forms a kind of transverse septum, partially dividing the cavity of the ampulla into two chambers. In the substance of the sacculi and ampullae, the nervous filaments radiate in all directions, anastomosing with each other and forming interlacements and loops, and terminate on the inner surface of the membrane in minute papillae, resembling those of the retina. The Cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments which enter the foramina of the tractus spiralis foraminulentus in the base of the cochlea, and passing upwards in the canals of the modiolus, bend outwards at right angles, to be distributed in the tissue of the lamina spiralis. The central portion of the nerve passes through the tubulus centralis of the modiolus, and supplies the apicial portion of the lamina spiralis. In the lamina spiralis the nervous filaments lying side by side on an even plane form numerous anastomosing loops, and spread out into a nervous membrane. According to Treviranus and Grottsche, the ultimate terminations of the filaments assume the form of papillae. The Arteries of the labyrinth are derived from the internal auditory branch of the superior cerebellar, or basilar artery, and from the stylo-mastoid. ORGAN OF TASTE. The Tongue is composed of muscular fibres, which are distributed in layers arranged in various directions : thus, some are disposed longitudinally (lingualis superficialis); others transversely (lin- gualis transversus); others, again, obliquely and vertically. Be- tween the muscular fibres is a considerable quantity of adiposePAPIX,L^ OF THE TONGUE. 570 substance, and in the middle of the organ a vertical septum of fibrous tissue. The tongue is connected, posteriorly, with the os hyoides by muscular attachment; and to the epiglottis by mucous membrane, which forms the three glosso-epiglottic folds called frcena epiglot- tidis. At either side it is held in connexion with the lower jaw by mucous membrane ; and in front, a fold of that membrane, which is named frcenum linguce, is formed beneath its under surface. The surface of the tongue is covered by a dense layer analogous to the corium of the skin, which gives support to papillae. A raphe marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The Papillae, of the tongue are, the— Papillae circumvallatae, Papillae filiformes, Papillae conicae, Papillae fungiformes. The Papilla circumvallatce (p. lenticulares) are of large size, and from fifteen to twenty in number. They are situated on the dorsum of the tongue, near its root, and form a row at each side, which meets its fellow at the middle line, like the two branches of the letter A. Each papilla resembles a cone, attached by its apex to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression ; hence they are also named papillae calyciformes. This cup-shaped cavity forms a kind of fossa around the papilla, whence their name circumvallatae. At the meeting of the two rows of these papillae upon the middle of the root of the tongue, is a deep mucous follicle called foramen cwcum. The Papillce conical and filiformes cover the whole surface of the tongue in front of the circumvallatae, but are most abundant towards its anterior part. They are conical and filiform in shape, and many of them are pierced at the extremity by a minute aper- ture. Hence, they may be regarded as follicles rather than sentient organs ; the true sentient papillae being extremely minute and occupying their surface, as they do that of the other papillae of the tongue. The Papillae fungiformes (p. capitatae) are irregularly dispersed over the dorsum of the tongue, and are easily recognised among the other papillae by their rounded heads, larger size, and red colour. A number of these papillae will generally be observed at - the tip of the tongue. Behind the papillae circumvallatae, at the root of the tongue, are a number of mucous glands (lingual), which open on the surface. There is also a small cluster beneath the tip of the tongue. Vessels and Nerves.—The tongue is abundantly supplied with blood by the lingual arteries. The Nerves are three in number, and of large size; the gusta-571 MUCOUS MEMBEANE OF THE TONGUE. tory branch of the inferior maxillary is distributed to the papillae, and is the nerve of common sensation and taste ; the glosso- pharyngeal is distributed to the mucous membrane, glands, and papillae circumvallatse; and the hypoglossal, the motor nerve of the tongue, is distributed to the muscles. The Mucous membrane which invests the tongue is continuous with the derma along the margin of the lips. On either side of the frsenum linguae it may be traced through the sublingual ducts into the sublingual glands, and along Wharton'sf ducts into the sub- maxillary glands ; from the sides of the cheeks it passes through the opening of Stenon'sJ ducts to the parotid glands: in the fauces, it forms the assemblage of follicles called tonsils, and may thence be traced downwards into the larynx and pharynx, where it is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth are a number of small glands, which pour their secretion upon the surface. A considerable number of these bodies are situated within the lips, in the palate, and in the floor of the mouth. They are named according to their position, labial glands, palatal glands, and buccal glands. * The tongue with its papillae. 1.

The Shin is the exterior investment of the body, which it serves to cover and protect. It is continuous at the apertures of the internal cavities with the lining membrane of those cavities, the internal skin or mucous membrane, and is composed essentially of two layers, derma and epidermis. The derma or cutis is chiefly composed of areolo-fibrous tissue, besides which it has entering into its structure elastic tissue and smooth muscular fibre, together with blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. The areolo-fibrous tissue exists in greatest abundance in the deeper stratum of the derma, which is conse- quently dense, white, and coarse ; the superficial stratum, on the other hand, is fine in texture, reddish in colour, soft, raised into minute papilla, and highly vascular and sensitive. These dif- ferences in structure have given rise to a division of the derma into the deep stratum, or corium, and the superficial, or papil- lary layer. In the Corium the areolo-fibrous tissue is collected into fasciculi, which are small and closely interwoven in the superficial strata, large and coarse in the deep strata ; in the latter forming an areolar network, with large areolae, which are occupied by adipose tissue. These areolae are the channels through which the branches of vessels and nerves find a safe passage to the papillary layer, in which and in the superficial strata of the corium they are princi- pally distributed. The yellow elastic tissue is found chiefly in the superficial strata, the smooth muscular tissue in the deep. It is to the latter that the nipples and scrotum owe their contractile power, and the general surface of the skin the contraction which is known by the name of cutis anserina. The corium presents some variety in thickness in different parts of the body. Thus in the more exposed regions, as the back, the outer sides of the limbs, the palms, and the soles, it is remarkable for its thickness ; while on protected parts it is comparatively thin, and on the eyelids, penis, and scrotum is peculiarly delicate. It is connected by its under surface with the common superficial fascia of the body. The Papillary layer of the derma is raised in the form of conical prominences or papillae. On the general surface of the body the papillae are short and exceedingly minute ; but in other situations, as the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, and the plantar surface of the feet and toes, they are long and of large size. They also differ in arrangement; for, on the general surface, they are distributed at unequal distances and without order ; whereas, on the palms and soles, and on the corresponding surfaces of the fingers and toes, they are collected into little square clumps, containing from ten to twenty papillae ; and these little clumps are disposed in parallel rows. It is this arrangement in rows that gives rise toEPIDERMIS OR CUTICLE. 573 Fig. 216* the characteristic parallel ridges and furrows which are met with on the hands and feet. The papillae in these little square clumps are for the most part uniform in size and length, but every here and there one papilla may be observed which is longer than the rest. The largest papillae of the derma are those which produce the nail ; in the dermal follicle of the nail they are long and filiform, while beneath its concave sur- face they form longitudinal and pa- rallel plications which extend for nearly the entire length of that organ. In structure the papilla is composed of homogeneous, nucleated, and fibrillated areolar tissue, bounded by a structure- less limitary membrane, and containing transverse elastic fibres with a capillary and nervous loop ; besides which, in some papillae, are certain peculiar bodies, called by Wagner corpuscula tactus. The Epidermis or cuticle (scarfskin) is a product of the derma, which it serves to envelope and defend. That surface of the epidermis which is exposed to the influence of the atmosphere and exterior sources of injury, is hard and horny in texture, while that which lies in con- tact with the papillary layer is soft and cellular. Hence the epider- mis, like the derma, is divisible into two layers, external and in- ternal, the latter being termed the rete mucosum. Moreover, the epidermis is laminated in structure, and the laminae present a pro- gressively increasing tenuity and density as they advance from the inner to the outer surface. This difference of density is dependent on the mode of growth of the epidermis, for as the external surface is constantly subjected to destruction from attrition and chemical action, so the membrane is continually reproduced on its internal surface ; new layers being successively formed on the derma to take the place of the old. The theory of growth of the epidermis, deduced from the obser- vations of Schwann, is as follows : a stratum of plastic lymph (liquor sanguinis) is poured out on the surface of the derma. This fluid, by virtue of the vital force inherent in itself, and communicated to it by contact with a living tissue, is converted into granules, which * Portion of skin from the palm of the hand. 1.

By endosmosis, these cytoblasts imbibe serum from the plastic lymph and adjacent tissues, and the outermost layer or pellicle of the cytoblast becomes gradually dis- tended by the imbibed fluid. The cytoblast has now become a cell, and the solid portion of the cytoblast, which always remains adhe- rent to some one point of the internal surface of the cell-membrane, is the nucleus of the cell. Moreover, within the nucleus one or several nuclei are formed, which are termed nucleoli. By a con- tinuance of the process of imbibition, the cell becomes more or less spherical; so that, after a time, Fig. 217.* every part of the surface of the papillary layer of the derma is coated by a thin stratum, con- sisting of spherical cells lying closely pressed together, and corresponding with every irre- gularity of the papillae. But, as this production of cells is a function constantly in opera- tion, a new layer is formed be- fore the first is completed, and the latter is separated by subse- quent formations farther and farther from the surface of the papillary layer. As a conse- quence of loss of contact with the derma, the vital force is progres- sively diminished ; the cell becomes subject to the influence of physical laws, and evaporation of its fluid slowly ensues. In con- sequence of this evaporation, the cell becomes collapsed and flat- tened, and assumes an elliptical form ; the latter is by degrees converted into the flat cell with parallel and contiguous layers, and an included nucleolated nucleus ; and lastly, the flattened cell de- siccates into a thin membranous scale, in which the nucleus is scarcely apparent. My own investigations + have shown that, after the original granules of the liquor sanguinis have become aggregated into a granular nucleus, other granules are formed in successive circles, around the circumference of the nucleus, until the entire breadth of the epidermal scale is attained ; that the cell never acquires a greater thickness than that of the original nucleus, and, that the * Diagram illustrative of the development of the epidermis and of epithelia in general, according to the theory of Schwann. 1.

Consequently, the cell never possesses any other than the flattened form ; all its phases of growth are perfected in the deepest layer of the epidermis; and, in its internal structure, it is a parent cell containing secondary and tertiary cells and granules, its growth being the result of the growth of these secondary formations. The under surface of the epidermis is accurately modelled on the papillary layer of the derma, each papilla having its appropriate sheath in the newly-formed epidermis or rete mucosum, and each irregularity of surface of the former having its representative in the soft tissue of the latter. On the external surface, this character is lost; the minute elevations corresponding with the papillae are, as it were, polished down, and the surface is rendered smooth and uniform. The palmar and plantar surface of the hands and feet are, however, an exception to this rule ; for here, in consequence of the large size of the papillae and their peculiar arrangement in rows, ridges corresponding with the papillae are strongly marked on the superficial surface of the epidermis. The epidermis is remarkable for its thickness in situations where the papillae are large, as in the palms and soles. In other situations, it assumes a character which is also due to the nature of the surface of the derma ; namely, that of being marked by a network of linear furrows, which trace out the surface into small polygonal and lozenge-shaped areas. These lines correspond with the folds of the derma produced by its move- ments, and are most numerous where those movements are greatest, as in the flexures and on the convexities of joints. The dark colour of the skin among the natives of the South is due to the coloration of the primitive granules of which the cell is composed, especially the nucleus. As the cells desiccate, the colour of the gi'anules is lost ; hence the deeper hue of the rete mucosum. The pores of the epidermis are the openings of the perspiratory ducts, hair follicles, and sebiparous glands. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the derma, which enter its structure through the areolae of the under surface of the corium, divide into innumerable intermediate vessels, which form a rich capillary plexus in the superficial strata of the skin and in its papillary layer. In the papillae of some parts of the derma, as in the longitudinal plications beneath the nail, the capillary vessels form simple loops, but in other papillae they are convoluted to a greater or less degree in proportion to the size and importance of the papillae. The Lymphatic vessels probably form, in the super- ficial strata of the derma, a plexus, the meshes of which are inter- woven with those of the capillary and nervous plexus. No lym- phatics have as yet been discovered in the papillae. The Nerves of the derma, after entering the areolae of the deeper part of the corium, divide into minute fasciculi, which form a terminal plexus in the upper strata of the corium. From this576 APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. plexus the primitive fibres pass off to their distribution as loops, in the papillae. In the less sensitive parts of the skin the loops are simple and more or less acute in their bend, in conformity with the figure of the papillae. In the sensitive parts, and especially in the tactile papillae of the pulps of the fingers, there are two loops, which are, moreover, associated with a peculiar body embedded in the substance of the papilla, the corpusculum tactics of "Wagner. APPENDAGES OP THE SKIN. The appendages of the skin are the nails, hairs, sebiparous glands, and perspiratory glands and ducts. The Nails are horny appendages of the skin, identical in forma- tion with the epidermis, of which they are a part. A nail is convex on its external surface, concave within, and implanted by means of a thin margin or root in a fold of the derma, which is nearly two lines in depth, and acts the part of a follicle to the nail. At the bottom of the groove of the follicle are a number of filiform papillae, which produce the margin of the root, and, by the successive forma- tion of new cells, push the nail onwards in its growth. The con- cave surface of the nail is in contact with the derma, and the latter is covered by papillae, which perform the double office of retaining the nail in its place, and giving it increased thickness by the addi- tion of newly-formed cells to its under surface. It is this constant change occurring in the under surface of the nail, co-operating with the continual formation taking place along the margin of the root, which ensures the growth of the nail in the proper direction. The nail derives a peculiarity of appearance from the disposition and form of the papillae on the ungual surface of the derma (matrix). Thus, beneath the root, and for a short distance onwards towards its middle, the derma is covered by papillae which are more minute, and consequently less vascular than the papillae somewhat farther on. This patch of papillae is bounded by a semilunar line, and that part of the nail covering it being lighter in colour than the rest, has been termed lunula. Beyond the lunula the papillae are raised into longitudinal plaits, which are exceedingly vascular, and give a deeper tint of redness to the nail. These plait-like papillae of the derma are well calculated by their form to offer an extensive surface both for the adhesion and formation of the nail. The granules and cells are developed on every part of their surface, both in the grooves between the plaits and on their sides, and a horny lamina is formed between each pair of plaits. When the under surface of a nail is examined, these longitudinal laminae, corresponding with the longi- tudinal papillae of the ungual portion of the derma, are distinctly apparent, and if the nail be forcibly detached, the laminae may be seen in the act of parting from the grooves of the papillae. It is this structure that gives rise to the ribbed appearance of the nail. The papillary substance of the derma which produces the nail is con- tinuous around the circumference of the attached part of that organ577 STRUCTURE OF HAIR. with the derma of the surrounding skin, and the horny structure of the nail is consequently continuous with that of the epidermis. Hairs are horny appendages of the skin, produced by the involu- tion and subsequent evolution of the epidermis ; the involution con- stituting the follicle in which the hair is enclosed, and the evolution the shaft of the hair. Hairs vary much in size and length in dif- ferent parts of the body ; in some they are so short as not to appear beyond the follicle ; in others, they grow to a great length, as on the scalp ; while along the margins of the eyelids, and in the whiskers and beard, they are remarkable for their thickness. Hairs are generally more or less flattened in form, and when the extremity of a transverse section is examined, it is found to possess an elliptical or reniform outline. This examination also demon- strates that the centre of the hair is porous and loose in texture, while its periphery is dense ; thus affording ground for its division into a cortical and a medullary portion. The free extremity of a hair is generally pointed, and sometimes split into two or thi-ee filaments. Its attached extremity is implanted deeply in the integument, ex- tending through the derma into the subcutaneous areolar tissue, where it is surrounded by adipose cells. The central extremity of a hair is larger than its shaft, and is called the root or bulb. It is rounded or conical in shape. The process of formation of a hair by its follicle is identical with that of the formation of the epidermis by the papillary layer of the derma. Plastic lymph is in the first instance exuded by the capil- lary plexus of the follicle, the lymph undergoes conversion, first into granules, then into cells, and the latter are elongated into fibres. The cells which are destined to form the surface of the hair go through a different process. They are converted into flat scales, which enclose the fibrous structure of the interior. These scales, as they are successively produced, overlap those which pre- cede and give rise to the prominent and waving lines which may be seen around the circumference of a hair. It is this overlapping line that is the cause of the roughness which we experience in drawing a hair, from its point to its bulb, between the fingers. The bulb is the newly-formed portion of the hair : its expanded form is due to the greater bulk of the fresh cells compared with the fibres and scales into which they are subsequently converted in the shaft. The colour of the hair, like that of the epidermis, is due to the coloration of the primitive granules of the cells. The Sebiparous glands are embedded in the substance of the derma, and present every degree of complexity, from the simplest follicle to the compound lobulated gland. In some situations their excretory ducts open independently on the surface of the epidermis ; while in others, they terminate in the follicles of the hairs. The sebiparous glands associated with the hairs are racemiform and lobulated, consisting of glandular vesicles which open by short p pSUDORIPAROUS GLANDS. 578 pedunculated tubuli into a common excretory duct, and the latter, after a short course, into the hair-follicle. In the scalp there are two of the glands to each hair-follicle. On the nose and face the glands are of large size, and constantly associated with small hair- follicles. In the meatus auditorius the ceruminous glands are also large; in the eyelids the cilia are supplied like other hairs with sebiparous glands, but the Meibomian glands may also be regarded as belonging to this class. The excretory ducts of sebiparous glands offer some diversity in different parts of the body ; in many situa- tions they are short and straight, in others, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where the epidermis is thick, they assume a spiral course. The sebiferous ducts are lined by an inversion of the epidermis, which forms a thick and funnel-shaped cone at its commence- Fig. 218 ment, but soon becomes uniform and soft. Sebi- parous glands are met with in all parts of the body, but are most abun- dant in the skin of the face, and in those situa- tions which are naturally exposed to the influence of friction. The sebaceous sub- stance when it collects in inordinate quantities within the excretory ducts becomes the ha- bitat of a remarkable parasitic animal, the steatozoon folliculorum. The Sudoriparous glands are situated deeply in the corium and also in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, where they are surrounded by adipose cells. They are small round or oblong bodies, composed of one or more convoluted tubuli, or of a congeries of glandular vesicles, * Section of the skin. 1. Epidermis. 2.

The latter ascends from the gland through the derma and epidermis, and terminates on the surface by a funnel-shaped and oblique aperture or pore. The efferent duct presents some variety in its course upwards ; within the derma it is straight, or curved and serpentine, and if the epidermis be thin, proceeds more or less directly to the excreting pore. Sometimes it is spirally curved within the derma, and having passed the latter, is regularly and beautifully spiral in its passage through the epi- dermis, the last turn forming an oblique and valvular opening on the surface. The spiral course of the duct is especially remarkable in the thick epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. On those parts of the skin where the papillae are irregularly dis- tributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriparous glands open on the surface also irregularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the pores are situated at regular distances along the ridges, at points corresponding with the intervals of the small, square-shaped clumps of papillae. Indeed, the apertures of the pores, seen on the surface of the epidermal ridges, give rise to the appearance of small transverse furrows, which intersect the ridges from point to point. The efferent duct and the glandular vesicles and tubuli of the sudoriparous gland are lined by an inflection of the epidermis. This inflection is thick and infunclibuliform in the upper stratum of the derma, but soon becomes uniform and soft. The infundibuliform projection is drawn out from the duct when the epidermis is re- moved, and may be perceived on the under surface of the latter as a nipple-shaped cone. A good view of the sudoriferous ducts is obtained by gently separating the epidermis of a portion of decom- posing skin ; or they may be better seen by scalding a piece of skin, and then withdrawing the epidermis from the derma. In both cases it is the lining sheath of epidermis, in other words, the epithelium, which is drawn out from the duct. p p 2580 CHAPTEE X. OF THE VISCERA. That part of the science of anatomy which treats of the viscera is named splanchnology, from the Gfreek words <rir\&yxvov, viscus, and X670S. The viscera of the human body are situated in the three great internal cavities ; cranio-spinal, thorax, and abdomen. The viscera of the cranio-spinal cavity, namely, the brain and spinal cord, with the principal organs of sense, have been already described, in conjunction with the nervous system. The viscera of the chest are: the central organ of circulation, the heart; the organs of respiration, the lungs; and the thymus gland. The abdominal viscera admit of a subdivision into those which properly belong to that cavity, viz., the alimentary canal, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and supra-renal capsules ; and those of the pelvis : the bladder and internal organs of generation. THORAX. The thorax is the conical cavity, situated at the upper part of the trunk of the body: it is narrow above and broad below, and is bounded in front, by the sternum, six superior costal cartilages, ribs, and intercostal muscles : laterally, by the ribs and intercostal muscles ; and, behind, by the ribs, intercostal muscles, and vertebral column, as low down as the upper border of the last rib and first lumbar vertebra ; superiorly, by the first rib at each side, the upper part of the sternum in front and the first dorsal vertebra behind; and, inferiorly, by the diaphragm. The superior opening of the thorax is closed by the thoracic fascia, and gives passage to the following parts, namely, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and longi colli muscles ; the trachea and oesophagus ; the carotid and subclavian arteries and veins, and thoracic duct; the pneumogastric, phrenic, and sympathetic nerves; and the upper part of the lungs and pleura?. The cavity of the thorax is much deeper on the posterior than on the anterior wall, in consequence of the obliquity of the diaphragm, and contains the heart enclosed in its pericardium, with the great vessels ; the lungs, with their serous coverings, the pleurae; the oesophagus; some important nerves ; and, in the foetus, the thymus gland. THE HEART. The central organ of circulation, the heart, is situated between the two layers of pleura which constitute the mediastinum, and is enclosed in a proper membrane, the pericardium.581 PERICAKDIUM. HEART. Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane like the dura mater, and resembles that membrane also in deriving its serous layer from the reflected serous membrane of the viscus which it encloses. It consists of two layers, external, fibrous ; and internal, serous. The fibrous layer is attached above, to the great vessels proceeding from the heart, on which it is continuous with the thoracic fascia; and below, to thetendinous portion of the diaphragm. The serous membrane invests the heart with the commencement of its great vessels as high as the arch of the aorta, and is then re- flected upon the internal surface of the fibrous layer. In intimate structure the fibrous layer is composed of areolar tissue; the serous layer consisting of a thin stratum of elastic tissue dis- posed in a net- work, adherent by one surface to the fibrous layer, and I smooth on the free surface, where it gives support to a single or double lamina of tesselated epi- thelium. The bag of the pericar- dium has few ves- sels and nerves, the latter being derived from the phrenic and re- current branch of the right pneumogastric. The Heart is placed obliquely in the chest, the base being directed upwards and backwards towards the right shoulder ; the apex forwards and to the left, pointing to the space between the t Anatomy of the heart. 1.

Sur- mounting the ventricles are the corresponding auricles, whose auri- cular appendages are directed forwards, and slightly overlap the root of the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the large anterior vessel at the root of the heart; it crosses obliquely the commencement of the aorta. The heart consists of two auricles and two ventricles, which are respectively named, from their posi- tion, right and left. The right is the venous side of the heart; it receives into its auricle the venous blood from every part of the body, by the superior and inferior cava and coronary vein. From the auricle the blood passes into the ventricle, and from the ven- tricle through the pulmonary artery, to the capillaries of the lungs. From these it is returned as arterial blood to the left auricle ; from the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle ; and from the left ventricle is carried through the aorta, to be distributed to every part of the body, and again returned to the heart by the veins. This constitutes the course of the adult circulation. The heart is best studied in situ. If, however, it be removed from the body, it should be placed in the position indicated by the above description of its situation. A transverse incision should then be made along the ventricular margin of the right auricle, from the appendix to its right border, and crossed by a perpendi- cular incision, carried from the side of the superior to the inferior cava. The blood must then be removed. Some fine specimens of white fibrin are frequently found with the coagula; occasionally they are yellow and gelatinous. The older anatomists called these substances " polypus of the heart;" they are usually met with in the right ventricle, and sometimes in the left cavities. The Right Auricle is larger than the left, and consists of a principal cavity or sinus, and an appendix auriculas. The interior of the sinus presents for examination five openings ; two valves ; two relicts of foetal structure ; and two peculiarities in the proper passes through the auriculo-ventricular opening into the ventricle, and thence through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. 16.

Its weight is about eleven ounces injthe male, and nine ounces in the female.RIGHT AURICLE. 583 structure of the auricle. To facilitate remembrance they may be thus arranged :— Superior cava, Relicts of ( Annulus ovalis, Inferior cava, foetal structure ( Fossa ovalis. Coronary vein, Foramina Thebesii, / Tuberculum Auriculo-ventricular. Structure of 1 Loweri, Eustachian valve, the auricle 1 Musculi pectinati. Coronary valve. \ The Superior vena cava returns the blood from the upper half of the body, and opens into the upper and back part of the auricle. The Inferior vena cava returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens through the lower and posterior wall, close to the partition between the auricles (septum auricularum). The direction of these two vessels is such, that a stream forced through the superior cava would rush towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. In like manner, a jet issuing from the inferior cava would dash its stream against the septum auricularum; this is the proper direction of the two currents during foetal life. The Coronary vein returns the venous blood from the substance of the heart; it opens into the auricle between the inferior cava and auriculo-ventricular opening, under cover of the coronary valve. The Foramina Thebesii* are minute pore-like openings of small veins (venae minimae) which issue directly from the muscular structure of the heart, without entering the venous current. These openings are also found in the left auricle, and in the right and left ventricles, but, in the latter, are generally believed to be mere caecal depressions. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the large opening of com- munication between the auricle and ventricle. The Eustachian^ valve is a part of the apparatus of foetal circu- lation, and serves to direct the placental blood from the inferior cava, through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. In the adult it is a mere vestige and imperfect, though sometimes it remains of large size. It is formed by a fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, containing some muscular fibres, is situated between the aperture of the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricul^j opening, and is generally connected with the coronary valve. The Coronary valve is a semilunar fold of the lining membrane, * Adam Christian Thebesius. His description of the openings now known by his name is contained in his " Dissertatio Medica de Circulo Sanguinis in Corde," 1708. f Bartholomew Eustachius, born at San Severino, in Naples, was Professor of Medicine in Rome, where he died in 1570.

The Annulybs ovalis is situated on the septum auricularum, opposite the termination of *the inferior cava. It is the rounded margin of the septum, which occupies the place of the foramen ovale of the foetus. The Fossa ovalis is an oval depression corresponding with the foramen ovale of the foetus. This opening is closed at birth by a thin valvular layer, which is continuous with the left margin of the annulus, and is frequently imperfect at its upper part. The depres- sion or fossa in the right auricle results from this arrangement. There is no fossa ovalis in the left auricle. * Anatomy of the heart; right side. 1. Cavity of right auricle. 2.

Being thicker than the walls of the veins, it .forms a projection, which was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava into the auriculo-ventricular opening. The Musculi pectinati are small muscular columns situated in the appendix auriculae. They are numerous, and arranged parallel with each other ; hence their cognomen "pectinati,'''' like the teeth of a comb. The Right or anterior ventricle is triangular and prismoid in form. Its anterior side is convex, and forms the larger portion of the front of the heart. The posterior side, which is also inferior, is flat, and rests on the diaphragm ; the inner side corresponds with the partition between the two ventricles, septum ventriculorum. Superiorly where the pulmonary artery arises, there is a dilatation * of the ventricle, termed the infundibidum or conus arteriosus. The right ventricle is to be laid open by making an incision parallel with, and a little to the right of, the anterior longitudinal furrow, from the pulmonary artery in front, to the apex of the heart, and thence by the side of the posterior longitudinal furrow behind to the auriculo-ventricular opening. It contains, to be examined, two openings, the auriculo-ventri- cular and that of the pulmonary artery ; two apparatus of valves, tricuspid and semilunar; and a muscular and tendinous apparatus belonging to the tricuspid valves. They may be thus arranged :— Auriculo-ventricular opening, Tricuspid valves, Opening of the pulmonary artery. Semilunar valves. Chordse tendinece, Carnese columnse. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane (endocardium) of the heart. It is the opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle. The Opening of the pulmonary artery is situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum, on the left side of the right ventricle, and upon the anterior aspect of the heart. The Tricuspid valves are three triangular folds of the lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are connected by their base around the auriculo-ventricular open- ing ; and by their sides and apices, which are thickened, they give attachment to a number of slender tendinous cords, called chordae tendinese. The chorda*, tendinew are the tendons of the thick mus- * Eichard Lower, M.D. " Tractatus de Corde; item de Motu et Colore Sanguinis," 1669. His dissections were made upon quadrupeds, and his observations relate rather to animals than man.ANATOMY OP THE HEAET. 586 cular columns (columnce carnece) which stand out from the.walls of the ventricle, and serve as muscles to the valves. A number of these tendinous cords converge to a single muscular attachment. The tricuspid valves prevent the regurgitation of blood into the auricle during the contraction of the ventricle, and they are pre- vented from being themselves driven back by the chordae tendineae and their muscular attachments. This connection of the muscular columns of the heart to the valves has caused their division ikto active and passive. The active valves are the tricuspid and mitral; the passive, the semilunar and coronary. The valves consist, according to King,* of curtains, cords, and columns. The anterior valve or curtain is the largest, and is so placed as to prevent the filling of the pulmonary artery during the distension of the ventricle. The right valve or curtain is of smaller size, and is situated on the right side of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The third valve, or "fixed curtain," is connected by its cords to the septum ventriculorum. The chords (chorda? tendinese) of the anterior curtain are attached, principally to a long column (columna carnea), which is connected with the "right or thin and yielding wall of the ventricle." From the lower part of this column a transverse muscular band, the " long moderator band," is stretched to the septum ventriculorum, or "solid wall " of the ventricle. The right curtain is connected, by means of its cords, partly with the long column, and partly with its own proper column, the second column, which is also attached to the "yield- ing vjall " of the ventricle. A third and smaller column is gene- rally connected with the right curtain. The "fixed curtain" is so named from its attachment to the "solid wall" of the ventricle, by means of cords only, without fleshy columns. From this arrangement of the valves it follows, that if the right ventricle be over distended, the thin or "yielding wall" will give way, and carry with it the columns of the anterior and right valve. The cords connected with these columns will draw down the edges of the corresponding valves, and produce an opening between the curtains, through which the superabundant blood may escape into the auricle, and the ventricle be relieved from over- pressure. This mechanism is therefore adapted to fulfil the function of a "safety valve." The Columnce carnece (fleshy columns) is a name expressive of the appearance of the internal walls of the ventricles, which, with the exception of the infundibulum, seem formed of muscular columns interlacing in almost every direction. They are divided, according to the manner of their connection, into three sets. 1. The greater number are attached by the whole of one side, and merely form convexities into the cavity of the ventricle. 2. Others are * " Essay on the Safety-Valve Function in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart," by T. W. King. Guy's Hospital Reports, vol. ii.LEFT AURICLE. 587 connected by both extremities, being free in the middle. 3. A few (columnse papillares) are attached by one extremity to the walls of the heart, and by the other give insertion to the chorda? tendinese. The Semilunar valves, three in number, are situated around the commencement of the pulmonary artery, being formed by a folding of its lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are attached by their convex borders, and free by the concave, which are directed upwards in the course of the vessel, so that, during the current of the blood along the artery, they are pressed against the sides of the cylinder; but if regurgitation ensue, they are immediately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tube. The margins of the valves are thicker than the rest of their extent, and each valve presents in the centre of this margin a small fibro-cartilaginous tubercle or nodule, called corpus Arantii,* which locks in with the other two during the closure of the valves, and secures the triangular space which would otherwise be left by the approximation of three semilunar folds. On either side of the nodule, the edge of the valve is folded and thin, and to this part the term lunula has been applied. When the valves are closed, the lunulas are brought in contact with each other by their surfaces. Between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are three pouches, called the pulmonary sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva). Similar sinuses are situated behind the valves at the commencement of the aorta, and are larger and more capacious than those of the pulmonary artery. The Pulmonary artery commences by a scalloped border, cor- responding with the three valves which are attached along its edge. It is connected to the ventricle by muscular fibres, and by the lining membrane of the heart. The Left or posterior auricle is somewhat smaller, but thicker than the right; of a cuboid form, and situated more pos- teriorly. The appendix auriculae is constricted at its junction with the auricle, and has a foliated appearance ; it is directed forwards towards the root of the pulmonary artery, to which the auriculas of both sides appear to converge. The left auricle is to be laid open by a X shaped incision, the horizontal section being made along the border which is attached to the base of the ventricle. It presents for examination five openings, and the muscular structure of the appendix; the fossa ovalis, as previously observed, is not to be seen on the left side of the septum auricularum. The parts to be examined, are,— Four pulmonary veins, Auriculo-ventricular opening, Musculi pectinati. * Julius Csesar Arantius, Professor of Medicine in Bologna. He was a disciple of Vesalius, one of the founders of modern anatomy. His treatise De Humano Fcetu, was published at Eome, in 1564.ANATOMY OP THE HEART. 588 The Pulmonary veins, two from the right and two from the left lung, open into the corresponding sides of the auricle. The two left pulmonary veins terminate frequently by a common opening. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture of communi- cation between the auricle and ventricle. The Musculi pectinati are fewer in number than in the right auricle, and are situated only in the appendix auriculae. Left Ventricle.—The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculorum, and con- tinuing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. The left ventricle is conical both in external figure and in the shape of its internal cavity. It forms the apex of the heart, by projecting beyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the advantage in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven * Anatomy of the heart; left side. 1. Cavity of left auricle.

It presents for examination, in its interior, two openings, two valves, and the tendinous cords and muscular columns ; they may be thus arranged : Auriculo-ventricular opening, Mitral valves, Aortic opening. Semilunar valves. Chordae tendineae, Columnae carneae. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is a dense fibrous ring, covered by the endocardium, but smaller in size than that of the right side. Its fibrous structure is closely connected with that of the right auriculo-ventricular and aortic rings ; at the junction of the three there is a fibro-cartilaginous mass, and, in some animals, a portion of bone. The Mitral valves are attached around the auriculo-ventricular opening, as are the tricuspid in the right ventricle. They are thicker than the tricuspid, and consist of two segments, of which the larger is placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of the aorta, and acts the part of a valve to that foramen during the filling of the ventricle. The difference in size of the two valves, both being triangular, and the space between them, has given rise to the idea of a "bishop's mitre," after which they are named. These valves, like the tricuspid, are furnished with an apparatus of tendinous cords, chorda teiidineos, which are attached to two very large columnce carnece. The Columnar camem admit of the same ai*rangement into three kinds, as on the right side. Those which are free by one extremity, the colunma? papillares, are two in number, and larger than those on the opposite side ; one being placed on the left wall of the ventricle, the other at the junction of the septum ventriculorum with the posterior wall. The Semilunar valves are placed around the commencement of the aorta, like those of the pulmonary artery ; they are similar in structure, and are attached to the scalloped border by which the aorta is connected with the ventricle. The nodule in the centre of each fold is larger than those of the pulmonary valves, and it was these that Arantius particularly described ; but the term '' corpora Arayitii," is now applied indiscriminately to both. The fossae between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are larger than those of the pulmonary artery ; and are called the " sinus aortici" (sinuses of Valsalva). STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. The arrangement of the fibres of the heart has been made the subject of careful investigation by Air. Searle, to whose article,590 STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. " Fibres of the Heart," in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Phy- siology, I am indebted for the following summary of their dis- tribution :— For the sake of clearness of description the fibres of the ven- tricles have been divided into three layers, superficial, middle, and internal, all of which are disposed in a spiral direction around the cavities of the ventricles. The mode of formation of these three layers will be best understood by adopting the plan pursued by Mr. Searle in tracing the course of the fibres from the centre of the heart towards its periphery. The left surface of the septum ventriculorum is formed by a broad and thick layer of fibres, which proceed backwards in a spiral direction around the posterior aspect of the left ventricle, and become augmented on the left side of that ventricle by other fibres derived from the bases of the two columns papillares. The broad and thick band formed by the fibres from these two sources, curves around the apex and lower third of the left ventricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it divides into two bands, a short or apicial band, and a long or basial band. The Short or apicial band is increased in thickness at this point by receiving a layer of fibres (derived from the root of the aorta and carnese columnar) upon its internal surface, from the right surface of the septum ventriculorum ; it is then continued onwards in a spiral direction from left to right, around the lower third of the anterior surface, and the middle third of the posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum. From the latter point the short band is prolonged around the posterior and outer border of the left ventricle to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle, and is inserted into the anterior border of the left auriculo-ventricular ring and anterior part of the root of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The Long or basial band, at the anterior border of the septum, passes directly backwards through the septum (forming its middle layer), to the posterior ventricular groove, where it becomes joined by fibres derived from the root of the pulmonary artery. It then winds spirally around the middle and upper third of the left ven- tricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it is connected by means of its internal surface with the superior fibres derived from the aorta, which form part of the right wall of the septum. From this point it is continued around the upper third of the anterior and posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum, where it is connected with the fibres constituting the right surface of the septum ventriculorum. At the latter point the fibres of this band begin to be twisted upon themselves, like the strands of a rope, the direction of the twist being from below upwards. This arrangement of fibres is called by Mr. Searle " the rope ;" it is continued spirally upwards, forming the brim of the left ventricle, to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle,STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. 591 where the twisting of the fibres ceases. The long band then curves inwards towards the septum, and spreads out upon the left surface of the septum into the broad and thick layer of fibres with which this description commenced. The most inferior of the fibres of the left surface of the septum ventriculorum, after winding spirally around the internal surface of the apex of the left ventricle, so as to close its extremity, form a small fasciculus, which is excluded from the interior of the ven- tricle, and expands in a radiated manner over the surface of the heart, constituting its superficial layer of fibres. The direction of these fibres is, for the most part, oblique, passing from left to right on the anterior and from right to left on the posterior surface of the heart, becoming more longitudinal near its base, and terminating by being inserted into the fibrous rings of the auriculo-ventricular openings, and of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Over the right ventricle the superficial fibres are increased in number by the addi- tion of accessory fibres from the right surface of the septum, which pierce the middle layer, and take the same direction as the super- ficial fibres from the apex of the left ventricle, and of other acces- sory fibres from the surface of both ventricles. From this description it will be perceived that the superficial layer of fibres is very scanty, and is pretty equally distributed over the surface of both ventricles. The middle layer of both ventricles is formed by the two bands, short and long. But the internal layer of the two ventricles is very differently constituted ; that of the left is formed by the spiral expansion of the fibres of the rope, and of the two columnse papillares ; that of the right remains to be described. The septum ventriculorum also consists of three layers, a left layer, the radiated expansion of the rope and carnese columnse ; a middle layer, the long band; and a right layer, belonging to the proper wall of the right ventricle, and con- tinuous both in front and behind with the long band ; and in front also with the short band, and with the superficial layer of the right ventricle. The Internal layer of the right ventricle is formed by fasciculi of fibres which arise from the right segment of the root of the aorta, from the entire circumference of the root of the pulmonary artery, and from the bases of the columnse papillares. The fibres from the root of the aorta, associated with some from the carneae columnse, constitute a layer which passes obliquely forwards upon the right side of the septum. The superior fibres coming directly from the aorta join the internal surface of the long band at the anterior border of the septum, while the lower two-thirds of the layer are continuous with the internal surface of the short band, some of its fibres piercing that band to augment the number of superficial fibres. The fibres derived from the root of the pulmonary artery, conjoined with those from the base of one of the columnar papillares, curve forwards from their origin, and wind obliquely downwardsMINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. 592 and backwards around the internal surface of tbe wall of the ven- tricle to the posterior border of the septum, where they become continuous with the long band, directly that it has passed back- wards through the septum. Fibres of the Auricles.—The fibres of the auricles are disposed in two layers, external and internal. The internal layer is formed of fasciculi which arise from the fibrous rings of the auriculo-ven- tricular openings, and proceed upwards to enlace with each other, and constitute the appendices auricularum. These fasciculi are parallel in their arrangement, and in the appendices form pro- jections and give rise to the appearance which is denominated musculi pectinati. In their course they give off branches whieh connect adjoining fasciculi, and form a columnar interlacement between them. External Layer.—The fibres of the right auricle having completed the appendix, wind from left to right around the right border of this auricle, and along its anterior aspect, beneath the appendix, to the anterior surface of the septum. From the septum they are con- tinued to the anterior surface of the left Auricle, where they sepa- rate into three bands, superior, anterior, and posterior. The superior band proceeds onwards to the appendix, and encircles the apex of the auricle. The anterior band passes to the left, beneath the appendix, and winds as a broad layer completely around the base of the auricle, and through the septum to the root- of the aorta, to which it is partly attached, and from this point is continued onwards to the appendix, where its fibres terminate by interlacing with the musculi pectinati. The posterior band crosses the left auricle obliquely to its posterior part, and winds from left to right around its base, encircling the openings of the pulmonary veins ; some of its fibres are lost on the surface of the auricle, others are continued onwards to the base of the aorta ; and a third set, forming a small band, are prolonged along the anterior edge of the appendix to its apex, where they are continuous with the superiorband. The septum auricularum has four sets of fibres entering into its formation ; 1. The fibres arising from the auriculo-ventricular rings at each side ; 2. Fibres arising from the root of the aorta, which pass upwards to the transverse band, and to the root of the superior cava ; 3. Those fibres of the anterior band that pass through the lower part of the septum in their course around the left auricle ; and, 4. A slender fasciculus, which crosses through the septum from the posterior part of the right auriculo-ventricular ring to the left auricle. It will be remarked, from this description,- that the left auricle is considerably thicker and more muscular than the right. Minute structure.—The Pericardium is a thin layer, composed of a network of fine elastic fibres, adherent by the deep surface to the muscular structure of the heart, and supporting on its free593 ENDOCARDIUM. surface a single or double lamina of tesselated epithelium. Beneath the pericardium, especially in the grooves of the heart, is more or less adipose tissue, which is sometimes distributed more extensively over the surface of the organ. The Endocardium, or lining membrane of the heart, is also thin, but thicker in the auricles than in the ventricles, and especially in the left auricle. It consists of three layers, namely, 1, a thin stratum of white fibrous areolar tissue, which connects it to the muscular structure : 2, a middle layer, composed of elastic tissue, which is so abundant in the auricles as to constitute a thin elastic membrane possessed of several laminae : and, 3, an epithelium, consisting of a single or double layer of more or less elongated or polygonal, flattened nucleated cells. The surface of the middle layer, on which the epithelium is embedded, presents a smooth stratum of fine elastic Fiff- 222.* fibres, arranged longitudinally, while the chief thickness of the layer is made up of fine and aiiXW coarse elastic networks, connected by a matrix of areolar tissue, in the meshes of which are numerous scattered nuclei. In the ven- tricles the endocardium is transparent; _in the auricles, particularly the left, it istfpaK] and white, and continuous with the rnnlg membrane of the vessels which open into the heart. The muscular fibres are more slender and friable than those of the rest of the muscular system ; the sarcolemma is more delicate ; the longitudinal markings and nuclei more appa- rent ; the fibres, more closely united together, have less intervening areolar tissue, are in- extricably interlaced, and form innumerable anastomosing plexuses, a character peculiar to the muscular structure of the heart. The nuclei are placed in the axis of the fibre and in the same situation are found rows of minute fatty granules, which are excessively mul- tiplied in fatty degeneration of the heart. The auriculo-ventricular valves are composed of two layers of endocardium, connected in the body of the valve by areolo-fibrous tissue, mingled with a network of elastic fibres ; towards the edges of the valve, the two layers become blended with each other, and form a single membrane. The chorda? tendinem consist of a fasci- culus of tendinous fibres invested by a thin layer of endocardium. The semilunar valves are composed of a thin stratum of elastic and areolar tissue, the elastic tissue forming a fine network in the sub- * Epithelium of the endocardium; 1.

Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the heart are derived from the left and right coronary; the capillaries form a fine network around the muscular fasciculi as in other Fig. 223.* muscles ; the veins accompany the arteries, and empty themselves by the common coro- nary vein into the right auricle ; the venaa minimse or vena? Thebesii discharging their blood directly into the auricle. The semi- lunar valves are an exception to the rest of the valves of the heart, in having no blood- vessels. Lymphatic vessels are scanty in the bag of the pericardium, but numerous beneath the membrana propria ; they follow the grooves of the heart, and terminate in the glands situated beneath the arch of the aorta, and upon the bifurcation of the trachea. The Nerves of the heart are numerous, and derived from the cardiac plexuses, which, are formed by filaments from the sympa- thetic and pneumogastric nerve, and reach the substance of the organ by means of the anterior and posterior coronary plexus. The nervous filaments partly accompany the vessels, partly cross their course, anastomose with each other at acute angles, and pierce the surface of the heart to reach its substance and the endocardium. The nerves are grey, being composed of fine pale fibres, a few only of the larger nerves containing in addition an admixture of nucleated fibres. The minute fusiform enlargements on the external branches are not ganglia, but mere thickenings of the neurilemma. ORGANS OF RESPIRATION AND VOICE. The organs of respiration are the two lungs, with their air-tube, the trachea, to the upper part of which is adapted an apparatus of cartilages, constituting the organ of voice, or larynx. THE LARYNX. The Larynx is situated at the fore-part of the neck, between the trachea and base of the tongue. It is a short tube, of an hour-glass form, and composed of cartilages, ligaments, muscles, vessels, nerves, and mucous membrane. * Anastomosing muscular fibres of the heart. After Kolliker.CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX. 595 The Cartilages are the— Thyroid, Cricoid, Two arytenoid, Two cornicula laryngis, Two cuneiform, Epiglottis. The Thyroid (dvpebs eldos, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx : it consists of two lateral portions, or ala7, which meet at an angle in front, and form the projection which is known by the name of pomum Adami. In the male, after puberty, the angle of union of the two alss is acute ; in the female, and before puberty in the male, it is obtuse. Where the pomum Adami is prominent, a bursa mucosa is often found between it and the skin. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and forms a rounded border posteriorly, which terminates above, in the superior cornu, and below, in the inferior cornu. On the side of the ala is an oblique line, or ridge, directed downwards and forwards, and bounded at each extremity by a tubercle. Into this line the sterno-thyroid muscle is inserted ; and from it the thyro-hyoid and inferior con- strictor take their origin. In the receding angle, formed by the meeting of the two alse, on the inner side of the cartilage, and near its lower border, are attached the epiglottis, chordse vocales, thyro- arytenoid and thyro-epiglottidean muscles. The Cricoid (KpUos—eldos, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, narrow in front, and broad behind, where it is surmounted by two rounded surfaces, which articulate with the arytenoid cartilages. At the middle line, posteriorly, is a vertical ridge which gives at- tachment to the oesophagus, and at each side of the ridge are the depressions which lodge the crico-aryten'bidei postici muscles. On either side of the ring is a glenoid cavity, which articulates with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The Arytenoid, cartilages (apvraipa,* a pitcher), two in number, are triangular and prismoid in form. They are broad and thick below, where they articulate with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; pointed above, and prolonged by two small pyriform fibro-cartilages, cornicula laryngis (capitula Santorini), which are curved inwards and backwards, and they each present three sur- faces, anterior, posterior, and internal. The posterior surface is concave, and lodges part of the arytenoideus muscle ; the internal surface is smooth, and forms part of the lateral wall of the larynx ; the anterior or external surface is rough and uneven, and gives at- tachment to the chorda vocalis, thyro-arytenoideus, crico-arytenoi- deus lateralis and posticus, and, above these, to the base of the cuneiform cartilage. * This derivation has reference to the appearance of both cartilages taken together and covered by mucous membrane. In animals, which were the larynx, with the arytenoid cartilages, bears a curious resemblance to the mouth of a pitcher with a large spout. (rincipal subjects of dissection the ancients, the opening of the QQ2LIGAMENTS OF THE LARYNX. 596 The Cuneiform cartilages are two small cylinders of yellow fibro-cartilage, about seven lines in length, and enlarged at each extremity. By the lower end, or base, the cartilage is attached to the middle of the external surface of the arytenoid, and by its upper extremity forms a prominence in the border of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold of membrane. They are sometimes wanting. In the male, the cartilages of the larynx are more or less ossified, particularly in old age. The Epiglottis (e7n.y\a}TTi.s, upon the tongue) is a fibro-cartilage of a yellowish colour, studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in shallow pits on its surface. It is shaped like a cordate leaf, and placed immediately in front of the opening of the larynx, which it closes completely when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue. It is attached by its point to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage. Ligaments.—The ligaments of the larynx are numerous, and may be arranged into four groups : 1. Those which articulate the thyroid with the os hyoides. 2. Those which connect it with the cricoid. 3. Ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages. 4. Ligaments of the epiglottis. 1. The ligaments which connect the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number. Two Thyro-hyoidean ligaments pass between the superior cor- nua of the thyroid and the extremities of the greater cornua of the os hyoides : a sesamoid bone or cartilage is found in each. The Thyro-hyoidean- membrane is a broad membranous layer, occupying the entire space between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and the upper and inner border of the os hyoides. It is pierced by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. 2. The ligaments connecting the thyroid to the cricoid cartilage are also three in number :— Two Capsular ligaments, with their synovial membranes, which form the articulation between the inferior cornua of the thyroid and the sides of the cricoid ; and the crico-thyroidean membrane. The Crico-thyroidean membrane is a fan-shaped layer of yellow elastic tissue, thick in front (middle crico-thyroidean ligament) and thinner at each side (lateral crico-thyroidean ligament). It is at- tached by its apex to the lower border and receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and by its expanded margin to the upper border of the cricoid and base of the arytenoid cartilages. Superiorly it is continuous with the inferior margin of the chords vocales. The front of the crico-thyroidean membrane is crossed by a small artery, the inferior laryngeal, and is the spot selected for the operation of laryngotomy. Laterally it is covered in by the crico-thyroidei and crico-arytenoidei laterales muscles. 3. The ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages are eight in number :— Two Capsular ligaments, with synovial membranes, which arti-LIGAMENTS OF THE LAEYNX. 597 culate the arytenoid cartilages with the cricoid, strengthened behind by two posterior crico-arytenoid bands or ligaments; and the supe- rior and inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments. The superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments are two thin bands of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the receding angle of the Fig. 224.* thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior and inner border of each arytenoid cartilage. The lower border of this ligament constitutes the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx, and the fold of mu- cous membrane caused by its pro- minence has been called the supe- rior or false chorda vocalis. The inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or true chordce vocales, are thicker than the superior, and like them composed of yellow elastic tissue. Each ligament is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid. The inferior border of the chorda vocalis is con- tinuous with the lateral expansion of the crico-thyroid ligament. The superior border forms the lower boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The space between the two chordae vocales is the glottis or rima glottidis. 4. The ligaments of the epiglottis are five in number, namely, three glosso-epiglottic, hyo-epiglottic, and thyro-epiglottic. The glosso-epiglottic ligaments (frsena epiglottidis) are three folds * Vertical section of the larynx, showing its ligaments. 1. Body of os hyoides. 2. Its great cornu. 3. Lesser cornu. 4.

The middle of these con- tains elastic tissue. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the anterior aspect of the epiglottis near its apex, and the upper margin of the body of the os hyoides. The thyro-epiglottic ligament is a long and slender fasciculus of yellow elastic tissue, which embraces the apex of the epiglottis, and is inserted into the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage im- mediately below the anterior fissure and above the attachment of the chordae vocales. Muscles.—The muscles of the larynx are eight in number ; the five larger are the muscles of the chordse vocales and rima glottidis ; the three smaller are muscles of the epiglottis. The five muscles of the chordse vocales and rima glottidis are, Crico-thyroid, Thyro-arytenoideus, Crico-arytenoideus posticus, Arytenoideus. Crico-arytenoideus lateralis, The Crico-tliyroid muscle arises from the anterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes obliquely outwards and backwards to be inserted into the lower and inner Fig. 225.* border of the ala of the thyroid from its tubercle as far back as the inferior cornu. The Crico - arytenoideus posticus arises from the depression on the pos- terior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes upwards and outwards to be in- serted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid. The Crico-arytenoideuslateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, and passes upwards and back- wards to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The Thyro-arytenoideus arises from the receding angle of the thyroid carti- lage, close to the outer side of the chorda vocalis, and passes backwards parallel with the cord, to be inserted into the base and outer surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The Arytenoideus muscle occupies the posterior concave surface of the arytenoid cartilages, between which it is stretched.

The three muscles of the epiglottis are, Thyro-epiglottideus, jp\q_ 226 * Aryteno-epiglottideus superior, Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior. The Thyro-epiglottideus appears to be formed by the upper fibres of the thyro- arytenoideus muscle ; they spread out on the external surface of the sacculus laryngis and in the aryteno-epiglotti- dean fold of mucous membrane, on which they are lost; a few of the anterior fibres being continued onwards to the side of the epiglottis (depressor epiglottic!is). The Aryteno-epiglottideus superior consists of a few scattered muscular fibres, which pass forward in the fold of mucous membrane forming the lateral boundary of the entrance into the larynx, from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior, described by Hilton, and closely connected with the sacculus laryngis, may be seen by raising the mucous membrane immediately above the ventricle of the larynx. It arises by a narrow and fibrous origin from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the chorda vocalis; and passing forwards and a little upwards, expands over the upper half or two-thirds of the sacculus laryngis ; it is inserted by a broad attachment into the side of the epiglottis. Actions.—From a careful examination of the muscles of the larynx, Bishopf concludes, that the crico-arytenoidei postici open the glottis while all the rest close it. The arytenoideus approxi- mates the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly, and the crico-arytenoidei laterales and thyro-arytenoidei anteriorly; the latter, moreover, close the glottis mesially. The crico-thyroidei are tensors of the chordae vocales, and these muscles, together with the thyro-ary- tenoidei, regulate the tension, position, and vibrating length of the vocal cords. The crico-thyroid muscles effect the tension of the chordae vocales by rotating the Cricoid on the inferior cornua of the thyroid ; by this action the anterior portion is drawn upwards and made to * Side view of larynx, one ala of the thyroid cartilage removed. 1.

The crico-arytenoidei postici separate the chordae vocales by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages outwards and downwards. The crico-ary- tenoidei laterales, by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages forwards, approximate the anterior angles to which the chordae vocales are attached. The thyro-arytenoidei draw the arytenoid cartilages forwards, and, by their connection with the chordae vocales, act upon the whole length of those cords. The thyro-epiglottideus acts principally by compressing the glands of the sacculus laryngis and the sac itself: by its attach- ment to the epiglottis it would act feebly upon that valve. The aryteno-epiglottideus superior serves to keep the mucous membrane of the sides of the opening of the glottis tense, when the larynx is drawn upwards and the opening closed by the epiglottis. Of the aryteno-epiglottideus, the "functions appear to be," writes Mr. Hilton, "to compress the subjacent glands which open into the pouch; to diminish the capacity of that cavity, and change its form ; and to approximate the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilage." Mucous Membrane.—The aperture of the larynx is a triangular or cordiform opening, broad in front and narrow behind ; bounded anteriorly by the epiglottis, posteriorly by the arytenoideus muscle, and on either side by a fold of mucous membrane stretched between the side of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilage. On the margin of this aryteno-epiglottidean fold the cuneiform car- tilage forms a prominence more or less distinct. The cavity of the larynx is divided into two parts by an oblong constriction produced by the prominence of the chordae vocales. That portion of the cavity which lies above the constriction is broad and triangular above, and narrow below; that which is below it, is narrow above and broad and cylindrical below, the circumference of the cylinder cor- responding with the ring of the cricoid; while the space included by the constriction is a narrow, triangular fissure, the glottis or rima glottidis. The form of the glottis is that of an isosceles tri- angle, bounded on the sides by the chordae vocales and inner sur- face of the arytenoid cartilages, and behind by the arytenoideus muscle. Its length is greater in the male than in the female, and in the former measures somewhat less than an inch. Immediately above the prominence caused by the chorda vocalis, and extending nearly its entire length on each side of the cavity of the larynx, is an elliptical fossa, the ventricle of the larynx. This fossa is bounded below by the chorda vocalis, which it serves to isolate, and above by a border of mucous membrane folded upon the lower edge of the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament (superior or false chorda vocalis). The whole of the cavity of the larynx, with its prominences and depressions, is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous superiorly with that of the mouth and pharynx, andVESSELS AND NERVES OF THE LARYNX. 601 iuferiorly is prolonged through the trachea and bronchial tubes into the lungs. In the ventricles of the larynx the mucous membrane forms a cascal pouch of variable size, termed by Hilton the sacculus laryngis* The sacculus laryngis is directed upwards, sometimes extending as high as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and occasionally above that border. "When dissected from the interior of the larynx it is found covered by the aryteno-epiglottideus muscle and a fibrous membrane, which latter is attached to the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament below ; to the epiglottis in front; and to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage above. If examined from the exterior of the larynx, it will be seen to be covered by the thyro-epiglottideus muscle.

It is invested by a columnar ciliated epithelium as high up as the supe- rior folds of the ventricle of the larynx and" lower half-of the epiglottis. Glands.—The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with an abundance of mucous glands ; many of these are situated on the epiglottis, in the sacculus laryngis, and in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, where they are termed arytenoid. The body known as the epi- glottic gland is merely a mass of areolar and adipose tissue, situated in the triangular space between the front surface of the apex of the epiglottis, the hyo-epiglottidean and the thyro-hyoidean ligament. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The nerves are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal; both branches of the pneumo- * This sac was described by Mr. Hilton before he was aware that it had already been pointed out by the older anatomists. I myself made a dissection, of the same sac in an enlarged state, during the month of August, 1837, with- out any knowledge either of Mr. Hilton's labours or Morgagni's account. The sac projected considerably above the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and the extremity had been snipped off at one side in the removal of the muscles. The larynx was sent to me by Dr. George Moore; he had obtained it from a child who died of bronchial disease; and he conceived that this peculiar disposition of the mucous membrane might possibly explain some of the symptoms by which the case was accompanied. Cruveilhier made the same observation in equal ignorance of Morgagni's description, for we read in a note at page 677, vol. ii. of his Anatomie Descriptive,—" J'ai vu pour la premiere fois cette arriere cavite chez un individu alfecte de phthisie laryng^e, ou elle etait tres-d6veloppee. Je fis des recherches sur le larynx d'autres individus, et je trouvai que cette disposition etait constante. Je ne savais pas alors que Morgagni avait indique et fait representer la meme disposition." Cruveilhier compares its form very aptly to a "Phrygian casque," and Mor- gagni's figure, Advers. 1. Epist.

The two nerves communicate with each other ; but the superior laryngeal is distributed principally to the mucous mem- brane at the entrance of the larynx ; the recurrent, to the muscles. THE TRACHEA. The Trachea or wind-pipe is cylindrical for about two-thirds of its circumference, and flattened on the posterior third, where it rests on the oesophagus ; it extends from opposite the fifth cervical vertebra to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi. The length of the trachea is about four inches, and its diameter from side to side nearly an inch ; it is somewhat larger in the male than in the female. The right bronchus, larger than the left, passes off nearly at right angles, to the upper part of the corresponding lung. The left descends obliquely, and passes beneath the arch of the aorta, to reach the left lung. It is composed of cartilaginous rings, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, elastic tissue, and is lined by mucous membrane. The Cartilaginous rings are from fifteen to twenty in number, and extend for two-thirds around its cylinder, being deficient at the posterior part. The first ring is received within the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage, and is broader than the rest ; the last is broad at the middle in consequence of the prolongation of the lower border into a triangular process which curves backwards at the point of bifurcation. The posterior extremities of the rings are rounded, and occasionally one or two rings will be found to bifurcate. The Fibrous membrane connects the rings and forms a thin cover- ing to them on the outer surface. Inter- Fi 29y * nally it does not reach the surface, and the rings have in consequence an appear- v'fMM [p1 '", a ance of greater prominence.

The Mucous membrane, which is pale, forms the internal lining of the tube, and has opening upon its surface the excretory tubes of numerous mucous glands ; it is furnished with a ciliated columnar * Ciliated epithelium from the trachea ; after Kolliker. 1.

The Mucous glands are small ovoid bodies situated internally to the fibrous membrane, between that membrane and the muscular layer behind, and in the substance of the fibrous membrane be- tween the rings. Their ducts open upon the mucous membrane. THYROID GLAND. The thyroid gland or body is a Mood-vascular gland; in other words, it secretes into the numerous cells of which it is composed, a peculiar fluid, which, originally separated from the blood, is again taken up by the veins or lymphatic vessels or both, and conveyed into the circulation, in this way performing some function in con- nection with the formation or renovation of the blood. It is situated on the trachea, and may therefore be considered in this place, although bearing no part in the function of respiration. This gland consists of two lobes, which are placed one on each side of the trachea, and are connected with each other by means of an isthmus, which crosses its upper rings, usually the third and fourth ; but in this respect there is some variety, a point necessary to be remembered in operations on the trachea. The lobes are somewhat conical in shape, being larger below than above, and the smaller end is continued upwards to the side of the thyroid cartilage. The isthmus is connected with the lower third of the two lobes, and often gives origin to a process of variable length and size-, called the pyramid or third lobe. The pyramid is generally situated on the left side of the isthmus and is sometimes derived from the left lobe. The left lobe is somewhat smaller than the right, the weight of the entire gland being about one ounce and a half. It is, however, larger in young persons and females than in adult males, and undergoes a slight increase during menstruation. Its permanent enlargement constitutes bronchocele, goitre, or the Derbyshire neck. The structure of the thyroid is of a brownish-red colour, and is composed of a dense aggregation of minute and independent mem- branous cavities or vesicles enclosed by a plexus of capillary vessels, and connected together by areolar tissue. The vesicles are composed of a membrana propria lined by a tesselated epithelium of nucleated cells, and contain a clear yellowish fluid, in which are found cyto- blasts and cells ; the latter measuring T-jV(r of an inch in diameter. A muscle is occasionally found connected with its isthmus, or with the pyramid, and is attached, superiorly, to the body of the os hyoides, or to the thyroid cartilage. It was named by Soemmering, " levator glandulce thyroidea?;" fig. 224. Vessels and Nerves.—It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Sometimes an additional artery 'is derived from the arteria innominata, and ascends upon the front of the trachea to be distributed to the gland. The woundingTHE LUNGS. 604 of the latter vessel, in tracheotomy, might be fatal to the patient. The nerves are derived from the superior laryngeal and from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. THE LUNGS. The lungs are two conical organs, situated one at each side of the chest, embracing the heart, and separated from each other by that organ and by a membranous partition, the mediastinum. On the external or thoracic side they are convex, and correspond with the form of the cavity of the chest; internally they are concave, to receive the convexity of the heart. Superiorly they terminate in a tapering cone, which extends above the level of the first rib into the root of the neck, and inferiorly they are broad and concave, and rest on the convex surface of the diaphragm. Their posterior border is rounded, broad and long ; the anterior, sharp, short, and marked by one or two deep fissures ; and the inferior border which surrounds the base is also sharp. The colour of the lungs is pinkish- grey, mottled, and variously marked with black. The surface is figured with irregularly polyhedral outlines, which represent the lobules of the organ, and the area of each of these polyhedral spaces is crossed by lighter lines representing smaller lobules. The weight of the lungs is about forty ounces, the right lung being two ounces heavier than the left. Each lung is divided into two lobes, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the posterior surface of the upper part of the organ, downwards and forwards to near the anterior angle of its base. In the right lung the upper lobe is subdivided by a second fissure, which extends obliquely forward from the middle of the preceding to the anterior border of the organ, and marks off a small triangular lobe. The left lung presents a deep notch in its anterior border, at a point corresponding with the apex of the heart. The right lung is larger than the left, in consequence of the inclination of the heart to the left side. It is also shorter, from the great convexity of the liver, which presses the diaphragm upwards on the right side of the chest considerably above the level of the left; and it has three lobes. The left lung is smaller, has only two lobes, but is longer than the right. Each lung is retained in its place by its root, which is formed by the pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, and bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary plexuses of nerves. The groove on the surface of the lung where the vessels enter its sub- stance is the hilum pulmonis ; and the position of the large vessels in the root of the lung, as follows : from before, backwards, they are placed in a similar order on both sides, viz.

The special relations of the roots of the lung are, for the right, the descending cava, which lies in front, and the vena azygos, which arches over it from behind to terminate in the superior vena cava.

The parenchyma of the lungs, when examined on the surface or by means of a section, is seen to consist of small polyhedral divisions, or lobules, which are connected to each other by an interlobular areolar tissue. These lobules again consist of smaller lobules, and the latter are formed by a cluster of air-cells, in the parietes of which the capillaries of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are distributed. Each lobule, taken alone, is provided with its separate bronchial tube, pulmonary artery, and vein, and is isolated from surrounding lobules by a process of areolar membrane derived from the subserous tissue ; the entire lung is an assemblage of these lobules, so separated and so connected, held together by the pleura. The serous investing membrane of the lungs or pleura is con- nected with the surface of the lobules by means of a subserous areolar tissue, which forms a distinct layer, and being prolonged between the lobules, is the bond of adhesion between them. This layer contains elastic tissue, and is a chief source of the elasticity of the lungs ; its interstices are moistened by a serous secretion, and are unincumbered with fat. Bronchial Tubes.—The two bronchi proceed from the bifurcation of the trachea opposite the third dorsal vertebra to their cor- responding lungs. The right, about an inch long, takes its course nearly at right angles with the trachea, and enters the upper part of the right lung ; while the left, two inches in length, and smaller than the right, passes obliquely beneath the arch of the aorta, and enters the lung at about the middle of its root. Upon entering the lungs they divide into two branches, and each of these divides and subdivides dichotomously to their ultimate termination in the inter- cellular passages and air-cells. According to Rainey,* the bronchial tubes continue to diminish in size until they attain a diameter of gV to ^ of an inch, and arrive within \ of an inch of the surface of the lung. They then become changed in structure, and are continued onwards in the midst of air-cells, under the name of intercellular passages. Lastly, the intercellular passages, after several bifurcations, terminate each by a csecal extremity or air-cell. The intercellular passages are at first cylindrical, like the bronchial tubes, but soon become irregular in shape from the great number of air-cells which open into them on all sides. The air-cells in the adult lung measure between -2^-5- and TV of an inch, they are irregular in shape, and, most fre- quently, four-sided cavities, separated by thin septa, and commu- * Medico-Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xxviii.607 BRONCHIAL TUBES. nicating freely with the intercellular passages, and sparingly with the bronchial tubes. In structure the bronchial tubes are composed of cartilages, fibrous membrane, muscular -fibres, elastic fibres, and mucous membrane. The cartilages in the primary bronchi are six or eight in num- Fiff- 229-* bsr in the right bronchus, and ten or twelve in the left. In the subsequent divisions of the bronchial tubes, which are cylin- drical in figure, the cartilages assume the form of thin plates of irregular shape and size, adapted to each other by their edges, and completely surround- ing the tubes. The plates are most strongly developed around the bifurcations of the tubes, and the point of division is furnished with ; a cartilage of a semilunar form.' They are found entering into the structure of the bronchial tubes until the latter are reduced to a quarter of a line in diameter, and are then lost. The fibrous membrane, which enters largely into the formation of the trachea and bronchial tubes, is the piincipal coat of the smallest tubes, and is continued to their terminations in the inter- cellular passages and air-cells. The muscular fibres belong to the class of non-striated, smooth, or organic muscle, they are arranged in rings around the tube, and form a muscular coat which is placed externally to the cartilaginous plates and is continued as far as the extremity of the tubes, being absent in the intercellular passages and air-cells. The elastic fibres, arranged in longitudinal fasciculi, form a thin stratum next the mucous lining; this elastic coat is prolonged to the ends of the tubes, and scattered fibres are found around the intercellular pas- sages and air-cells. The mucous membrane, lining the bronchial tubes, is provided with a ciliated columnar epithelium as far as their termination ; but in the intercellular passages and air-cells it is altered in its characters, is thin and transparent, and coated with a squamous epithelium. The capillaries of the lungs form plexuses which occupy the walls and septa of the air-cells and the walls of the intercellular passages, but are not continued into the bronchial tubes. The septa between * A diagram showing the dilatation of the ultimate bronchial tubes into intercellular passages, and the enlargement of the latter near the surface of the lung, a, a.

Air-cells near the surface of the lung.PLEURA. 608 the air-cells consist of a single layer of the capillary plexus enclosed in a fold of the mucous lining membrane. The air-cells of the central part of the lung are most vascular, and at the same time smallest, whilst those of the periphery are less vascular and larger. The pigmentary matter of the lungs is contained in the air-cells, as well as in the areolar tissue of the inter-lobular spaces and blood-vessels ; it is composed chiefly of carbon. The Pulmonary artery, conveying the dark and impure venous blood to the lungs, terminates in capillary vessels, which form a dense network in the parietes of the intercellular passages and air- cells, and then converge to form the pulmonary veins, by which the arterial blood, purified in its passage through the capillaries, is re- turned to the left auricle of the heart. The Bronchial arteries, branches of the thoracic aorta, ramify on the parietes of the bronchial tubes, and terminate partly in bronchial veins which convey the venous blood to the vena azygos on the right side, and the superior intercostal vein on the left; and partly in the pulmonary capillaries. The Lymphatics, commencing on the surface and in the substance of the lungs, terminate in the bronchial glands. These glands, very numerous and often of large size, are placed at the roots of the lungs, around the bronchi, and at the bifurcation of the trachea. In early life they resemble lymphatic glands in other sifcuations ; but in old age, and often in the adult, are black, and filled with carbonaceous matter, and occasionally with calcareous deposits. The Nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. They form two plexuses : anterior pulmonary plexus, situated upon the front of the root of the lungs, and composed chiefly of filaments from the deep cardiac plexus ; and posterior pulmonary plexus, on the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs, composed principally of branches from the pneumogastric. The branches from these plexuses follow the course of the bronchial tubes, and are distributed to the intercellular passages and air-cells. PLEURAE. Each lung is enclosed, and its structure maintained, by a serous membrane, the pleura, which invests it as far as the root, and is then reflected on the parietes of the chest. That portion of the membrane which is in relation with the lung is called pleura pul- monalis, and that in contact with the parietes, pleura costalis. The reflected portion, besides forming the internal lining to the ribs and intercostal muscles, also covers the diaphragm and thoracic surface of the vessels at the root of the neck, extending for somewhat more than an inch above the margin of the first rib. At the lower border of the root of the lung is a fold of the pleura, which extends down by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the diaphragm, and serves to retain the lower part of the lung in position. ThisABDOMEN. 609 fold is the broad ligament of the lung, ligamentum latum pul- monis. On its external surface, where the pleura is connected with sur- rounding parts, it is rough ; on its inner surface, smooth. At the right side, where the diaphragm is pressed upwards by the liver, the pleura is shorter than on the left, but it extends higher into the neck; while the left pleura, in consequence of the encroachment of the heart on the left side of the chest, is narrower than the right. MEDIASTINUM. The approximation of the two reflected pleurae in the middle line of the thorax forms a septum, which divides the chest into the two pulmonary cavities. This is the mediastinum. The two pleuras are not, however, in contact with each other at the middle line in the formation of the mediastinum, but have a space between them which contains all the viscera of the chest with the exception of the lungs. * The mediastinum is divided into an anterior, middle, and posterior portion. The Anterior mediastinum is a triangular space, bounded in front by the sternum, and at each side by the pleura. It contains a quantity of loose areolar tissue, in which are found some lymphatic vessels passing upwards from the liver, the remains of the thymus gland, the origin of the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and left trian- gularis sterni muscle, and the left internal mammary vessels. The Middle mediastinum contains the heart enclosed in its peri- cardium ; the ascending aorta; superior vena cava ; pulmonary arteries and veins ; bifurcation of the trachea ; and phrenic nerves. The Posterior mediastinum is bounded behind by the vertebral column, in front by the pericardium, and at each side by the pleura. It contains the aorta; the greater and lesser azygos vein, and superior intercostal veins; the thoracic duct ; oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves ; and the great splanchnic nerves. ABDOMEN. The abdomen is the inferior cavity of the trunk of the body ; it is bounded in front and at the sides by the lower ribs and abdominal muscles ; behind, by the vertebral column and abdominal muscles ; above, by the diaphragm ; and, below, by the pelvis ; and contains, the alimentary canal, the organs subservient to digestion, viz., the liver, pancreas, and spleen ; and the organs of excretion, the kidneys, with the supra-renal capsules. Regions.—For convenience of description of the viscera, and of reference to the morbid affections of this cavity, the abdomen is divided into certain districts or regions. Thus', if two transverse lines be carried around the body, the one parallel with the cartilages R RREGIONS OP THE ABDOMEN. 610 of the eighth ribs, the other with the highest point of the crests of the ilia, the abdomen will be divided into three zones. Again, if a perpendicular line be drawn, at each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament, the three primary zones will each be subdivided into three compartments or regions, middle and two lateral. Fig. 230 * The middle region of the upper zone being immediately over the small end of the stomach, is called epigastric (irrl yaarrjp, over the * Viscera of the abdomen in situ. 1,1.

The two lateral regions being under the cartilages of the ribs, are called hypochondriac (virb xovdpoi, under the cartilages). The middle region of the middle zone is the umbilical; the two lateral, the lumbar. The middle region of the inferior zone is the hypogastric (vird yacrT7]p, below the stomach) ; and the two lateral, the iliac. In addition to these divisions, we employ the term inguinal region, in reference to the vicinity of Poupart's ligament. Position of the Viscera.—In the upper zone will be seen the liver, extending across from the right to the left side ; the stomach and spleen on the left, and the pancreas and duodenum behind. In the middle zone is the transverse portion of the colon, with the upper part of the ascending and descending colon, omentum, small intestines, mesentery, and, behind, the kidneys and supra-renal capsules. In the inferior zone is the lower part of the omentum and small intestines, the csecum, ascending colon, descending colon with the sigmoid flexure, and ureters. The smooth and polished surface, which the viscera and parietes of the abdomen present, is due to the peritoneum. i PERITONEUM. The Peritoneum (irepiTelveiv, to extend around) is a serous membrane, and therefore, a shut sac : a single exception exists in the human subject to this character, viz., in the female, where the peritoneum is perforated by the open extremities of the Fallopian tubes, and is continuous with their mucous lining. The simplest idea that can be given of a serous membrane, which will apply equally to all, is, that it invests the viscus or viscera, and is then reflected on the parietes of the containing cavity. If the cavity contain only a single viscus, the consideration of the serous membrane is extremely simple. But in the abdomen, where there are a number of viscera, the serous membrane passes from one to the other until it has invested the whole, before it is reflected on the parietes. Hence its reflexions are a little more complicated. In tracing the reflexions of the peritoneum, in the middle line, we commence with the diaphragm, which is lined by two layers, one from the parietes in front, anterior, and one from the parietes behind, posterior. These two layers of the same membrane, at the posterior part of the diaphragm, descend to the upper surface of the liver, forming the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liver. They then surround the liver, one going in front, the other behind that viscus, and meeting at its under surface, pass to the stomach, forming the lesser omentum. They then, in the same manner, surround the stomach, and meeting at its lower border, descend for some distance in front of the intestines, and return to the trans- verse colon, forming the great omentum; they then surround the transverse colon, and pass directly backwards to the vertebral column, forming the transverse meso-colon.

The anterior descends, invests all the small intestines, and returning to the vertebral column, forms the mesentery. It then descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, which it holds in its place by means of a fold called meso-rectum, foi'ms a pouch, the recto-vesical fold, between the rectum and the bladder, ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, forming its false ligaments, and returns upon the anterior parietes of the abdomen to the diaphragm, whence we first traced it. In the female, after descending into the pelvis in front of the rectum, it is reflected upon the posterior surface of the vagina and uterus. It then descends on the anterior surface of the uterus, and forms at either side the broad ligaments of that organ. From the uterus it ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, and anterior parietes of the abdomen, and is continued, as in the male, to the diaphragm. In this way the continuity of the peritoneum, as a whole, is dis- tinctly shown, and it matters not where the examination commence or where it terminate, still the same continuity of surface will be discernible throughout. If we trace it from side to side of the abdomen, we may commence at the umbilicus ; we then follow it outwards, lining the inner side of the parietes to the ascending colon ; it surrounds that intestine ; it then surrounds the small intestine, and, returning on itself, forms the mesentery. It then invests the descending colon, and reaches the parietes on the opposite side of the abdomen, whence it may be traced to the exact point from which we started. The viscera, which are thus shown to be invested by the peri- toneum in its course from above downwards, are the Liver, Transverse colon, Stomach, Small intestines, Pelvic viscera. The folds formed between these and between the diaphragm and the liver, are— (Diaphragm.) Broad, coronary, and lateral ligaments. (Liver.) Lesser omentum. (Stomach.) Greater omentum. (Transverse colon.) Transverse meso-colon. Mesentery.614 PERITONEUM. Meso-rectum, Recto-vesical fold, False ligaments of the bladder. And. in the female, the— Broad ligaments of the uterus. The ligaments of the liver will be described with that organ. The Lesser omentum (gastro-hepatic) is the duplicature which passes between the liver and the upper border of the stomach. It is extremely thin, excepting at its right border, where it is free, and contains between its layers, the— Hepatic artery, Portal vein, Ductus communis choledochus, Lymphatics, Hepatic plexus of nerves. These structures are enclosed in a loose areolar tissue, called Glisson's capsule* The relative position of the three vessels is, the artery to the left, the duct to the right, the vein between and behind. If the finger be introduced behind this right border of the lesser omentum, it will be situated in an opening called the foramen of Winslow. f In front of the finger will lie the right border of the lesser omentum ; behind it, the diaphragm, covered by the ascend- ing or posterior layer of the peritoneum ; below, the hepatic artery, curving forward from the coeliac axis; and above, the lobus Spigelii. These, therefore, are the boundaries of the foramen of Winslow, which is nothing more than a constriction of the general cavity of the peritoneum at this point, arising out of the necessity for the hepatic and gastric arteries to pass forwards from the coeliac axis to reach their respective viscera. If air be blown through the foramen of "Winslow, it will descend behind the lesser omentum and stomach to the space between the descending and ascending pair of layers, forming the great omentum. This is sometimes called the lesser cavity of the peri- toneum, and that external to the foramen the greater cavity; in which case the foramen is considered as the means of communi- cation between the two. It may be objected to this division that it tends to lead the inexperienced to believe that there are two cavities, while, in reality, there is but one, the foramen of Winslow being merely a constriction of that one, to facilitate the communi- * Francis Glisson, Professor of Medicine in the University of Cambridge.

The Great omentum (gastro-colic) consists of four layers of peri- toneum, the two which descend from the stomach, and the same two, returning upon themselves to the transverse colon. A quantity of adipose substance is deposited around the vessels which ramify through its structure. It would appear to perform a double function in the economy : namely, protecting the intestines from cold ; and, facilitating the movement of the intestines on each other during their vermicular action. The Transverse meso-colon (fieaos, middle, being attached to the middle of the cylinder of the intestine) is the medium of con- nection between the transverse colon and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It affords to the nutrient arteries a passage to reach the intestine, and encloses between its layers, at the posterior part, the transverse portion of the duodenum. It also forms a transverse septum across the abdominal cavity. The Mesentery (/jl4<toj> %vrepov, connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine) is the medium of connection between the small intestines and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is oblique in direction, being attached to the posterior wall, from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa ; retains the small intestines in their place, and gives passage to the mesenteric arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics. The Meso-rectum, in like manner, retains the rectum in con- nection with the front of the sacrum. Besides this, there are some minor folds in the pelvis, as the recto-vesical fold, the false liga- ments of the bladder, and the broad ligaments of the uterus. The Appendices epiploicce are small irregular pouches of the peritoneum, filled with fat, and attached like fringes to the large intestine. Three other duplicatures of the peritoneum are situated in the sides of the abdomen ; they are the gastro-phrenic ligament, the gastro-splenic omentum, the ascending and descending meso-colon. The gastro-phrenic ligament is a small duplicature of the peri- toneum, which descends from the diaphragm to the extremity of the oesophagus, and lesser curve of the stomach. The gastro-splenic omentum (ligamentum gastro-lienale) is the duplicature which con- nects the spleen to the stomach. The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects the upper part of the ascending colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; and the descending meso- colon, that which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the abdominal wall. Structure of Serous Membrane.—Serous membrane consists of two layers, an external or areolar layer, and an internal layer or epithelium. The areolar layer is composed of areolar and elastic tissue ; is smooth, transparent, and non-vascular on its free surface ; and rough and vascular on the exterior, being connected to adjacent616 ALIMENTARY CANAL. structures by means of a subserous areolar tissue, which contains fat, and gives support to the vessels of the membrane. The epithelium consists of a simple tesselated layer of nucleated cells, which are flattened and polygonal, and about j-^-g- of an inch in diameter. The general characters of a serous membrane are, its resemblance to a shut sac, and its secretion of a peculiar fluid, similar to the serum of the blood ; but the former of these characters is not abso- lutely essential to the identity of a serous membrane ; for, as we have shown above, the peritoneum in the female is perforated by the extremities of the Fallopian tubes ; while in some aquatic reptiles there is a direct communication between its cavity and the medium in which they live. From the variable nature of the secretion of these membranes, they have been divided into two classes, the true serous mem- branes, viz., the arachnoid, pericardium, pleura?, peritoneum, and tunica? vaginales, which pour out a secretion containing but a small portion of albumen ; and the synovial membranes and bursa?, which secrete a fluid containing a larger quantity of albumen. ALIMENTARY CANAL. The Alimentary canal is a musculo-membranous tube, extending from the mouth to the anus. It is variously named in the different parts of its course ; and is divided into, the Mouth, - Pharynx, ^ (Esophagus, Stomach, !Duodenum, f Caecum, Jejunum, Large intestine \ Colon, Ileum. (Rectum. The Mouth (cavum, seu, cavitas oris) is the irregular cavity which contains the organ of taste and the principal instruments of mastication. It is bounded, in front, by the lips and fissura oris ; on either side, by the internal surface of the cheeks ; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongue, the mucous membrane stretched between the arch of the lower jaw and the under surface of the tongue, and by the teeth of the inferior maxilla ; and behind, by the soft palate and fauces. The space between the teeth and fleshy walls of the face is the vestibulum oris. The Lips (labium superius et inferius) are two fleshy folds formed externally by common integument and internally by mucous mem- brane, and containing between these two layers, muscles, a quantity of fat, and numerous small labial glands. They are attached to617 CHEEKS.—SOFT PALATE. the surface of the upper and lower jaw, and each lip is connected to the gum in the middle line by a fold of mucous membrane, the frcenum labii superioris and frcenum labii inferioris, the latter being very small. The Cheeks (buccse) are continuous with the lips, and form the sides of the face ; they are composed of integument, a large quantity of fat, muscles, mucous membrane, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheeks is reflected above and below on the sides of the jaws, and is attached posteriorly to the anterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw. At about its middle, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, is a papilla, on which may be observed a small opening, the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The Hard palate (palatum durum, seu, osteum) is a dense struc- ture, composed of mucous membrane, palatine glands, areolar tissue, vessels, and nerves, and firmly connected to the palate pro- cesses of the superior maxillary and palate bones. It is bounded in front and at each side by the alveolar processes and gums, and is continuous behind with the soft palate. Along the middle line it is marked by an elevated raphe, and presents at each side of the raphe a number of transverse ridges and grooves. Near its anterior extremity, and immediately behind the middle incisor teeth, is a papilla which corresponds with the termination of the anterior palatine canal, and receives the naso-palatine nerves. The Gums (gingivse) are composed of a thick and dense mucous membrane, which is closely adherent to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and embraces the necks of the teeth. They are remarkable for their hardness and insensibility ; and for their close contact, without adhesion, to the surface of the tooth. From the neck of the tooth they are reflected into the alveolus, and become continuous with the periosteal (peridental) membrane of that cavity. The Tongue has been already described as an organ of sense ; it is invested by mucous membrane, which is reflected from its under part upon the inner surface of the lower jaw, and constitutes with the muscles beneath, the floor of the mouth. On the under surface of the tongue, near its anterior part, the mucous membrane forms a considerable fold, which is called the frcenum Ungues; and on each side of the frasnum is a large papilla, carwncula sublingualis, the termination of the duct (Wharton's duct) of the submaxillary gland. Running back from this papilla is a ridge, occasioned by the prominence of the sublingual gland; and opening along the summit of this ridge, a number of small openings, the apertures of the excretory ducts of the gland. Posteriorly the tongue is con- nected with the os hyoides by muscle, and to the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane, the frosna epiglottidis. The Soft palate (palatum molle; velum pendulum palati) is a fold of mucous membrane situated at the posterior part of the618 TONSILS.—MUCOUS GLANDS OF THE MOUTH. mouth. It is continuous, superiorly, with the hard palate, and is composed of mucous membrane, palatine glands, and muscles. Hanging from the middle of its inferior border is a small rounded process, the uvula; and passing outwards from the uvula at each side are two curved folds of the mucous membrane, the arches or pillars of the palate. The anterior pillar (arcus palatinus inferior ; glosso-palatinus) is continued downwards to the side of the base of the tongue, and is formed by the prominence of the palato-glossus muscle. The posterior pillar (arcus palatinus superior ; pharyngo- palatinus) is prolonged downwards and backwards into the pharynx, being formed by the convexity of the palato-pharyngeus muscle. These two pillars, closely united, above, are separated below by a triangular interval or niche, in which the tonsil is lodged. The space included between the soft palate and the root of the tongue is the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded above by the soft palate ; on each side by the pillars of the soft palate and tonsil; and below by the root of the tongue. It is the opening between the mouth and pharynx. The Tonsils (amygdalse) are two glandular organs, about half an inch in length, shaped like almonds, and situated between the anterior and posterior pillar of the soft palate, at each side of the fauces. They are composed of an assemblage of mucous follicles, which open on the surface by twelve or fifteen apertures. Exter- nally, they are invested by the pharyngeal fascia, which separates them from the superior constrictor muscle and internal carotid artery, and prevents an abscess from opening in that direction. In relation to surrounding parts, each gland corresponds with the angle of the lower jaw. The Mucous glands of the mouth (orales) are racemose or lobu- lated glands ; they are yellowish or whitish in colour, rounded or multangular in form, and situated in the submucous areolar tissue. The labial glands vary in size from half a line to one line and a half in diameter, and form an almost continuous layer around the mouth. The buccal glands are numerous, but smaller than the labial; a few of larger size being located near the aperture of Stenon's duct. The molar glands are placed between the masseter and buccinator, and pierce the latter with their ducts opposite the molar teeth. The palatine glands are situated in the posterior half of the hard palate and in the soft palate ; in the latter forming a layer several lines in breadth. They are also numerous but small on the posterior part of the soft palate. The lingual glands form a thick stratum in the sub-mucous tissue beneath the mucous follicles at the root of the tongue ; this layer extends completely across the tongue, and their ducts, several lines in length, open by infundi- buliform expansions, some into the mucous follicles, others into the foramen csecum, others into the fossse of the papilla? circumvallatee, and others between the papillae. Mucous glands of the same kind are also dispersed on other parts of the tongue, but are smaller and619 MUCOUS GLANDS OF THE MOUTH. few in number ; a small group is found between the vertical folds on the sides of the tongue and a considerable group on its under / surface near the tip and on either side of the frsenum linguae. In minute structure the glandular organs of the mucous mem- brane of the mouth are divisible into follicles or follicular glands ; and racemose or lobulated glands. The follicular glands are simple, as those of the root of the tongue ; or compound, like the tonsil, which is merely an aggregation of simple follicular glands. The ' racemose or lobulated glands may be of the simplest construction, consisting of from four to eight lobules, which open directly into an excretory duct like the smaller oral glands, or of an aggregation of smaller and larger lobules, forming primary and secondary lobes, and finally a gland of considerable size, as the salivary. The follicular gland, in external appearance, is a mere crypt or pouch of mucous membrane, but the wall of the pouch is thickened, and presents two layers, superficial and deep, with an intermediate fibro-vascular matrix, in which are lodged a number of closed vesicles or capsules. These Fig. 232.* capsules are round or oblong, and whitish, from y-l^ to -^5- of an inch in diameter, and composed of an external coat of homogeneous areolar tissue, containing a greyish-white pulpy substance, consisting of small nu- cleated cells (3016Tr °f an inch), free nuclei, and a small quantity of alkaline fluid. The follicular glands of the root of the tongue form a continuous layer, stretching from the papillse circumvallatse backwards to the epiglottis, and from the tonsil on one side to that on the other side of the fauces. They are lenticular and globular in figure, from half a line to two lines in diameter, and placed superficially so as to form prominences on the surface of the membrane. Each gland is furnished with a central aperture which opens into its cavity; the cavity being lined with mucous membrane and epithelium, and containing a greyish mucus. The deep layer of the follicular gland is firmly adherent to the submucous tissue, and overlies the proper mucous glands, which form a stratum beneath the follicular glands. The tonsil is a compound follicular gland, consisting of an aggregation of fifteen or twenty simple follicular glands, inti- mately united and held together so as to constitute a single organ. * Follicular gland from the root of the tongue; after Kolliker. 1.

The capillary vessels of the follicular glands form a fine and close network around their bases. The racemose, or lobulated gland, is composed of several lobes, the lobes being made up of a branch or branches of an excretory duct, and vesicular dila- tations. The excretory ducts terminate in a common excretory duct, which opens on the surface of the mucous membrane, and the glandular vesicles or acini are cliver- ticxda and cmcal terminations of the smaller convoluted branches of the ex- cretory ducts. The glandular vesicles are globular or oval or pyriform in shape, about 4^ of an inch in diameter, and com- posed of a proper structureless coat, or memhrana propria, lined by an epithelial layer of spheroidal nucleolo-nucleated in breadth. The nucleated cells contain white or coloured granules, which give the proper colour to the glands. The excre- tory ducts are composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and lined by a layer of co- lumnar epithelium. The smallest racemose gland consists of several lobules, and the lobules are held together by areolar tissue, and by an external investing coat of the same tissue intermingled with elastic fibres. The capillary vessels of the glands form a close network around the glandular vesicles ; and the secretion of the glands is a clear yellowish mucus, with an occa- sional and accidental admixture of gra- nules, nuclei, and remains of cells. SALIVARY GLANDS.

The parotid gland, {irapk, near, ods, &tos, the ear,) the largest of the three, is situated immediately in front of the external ear, and extends superficially for a short distance over the masseter muscle, and deeply behind the ramus of the lower jaw. It reaches inferiorly to below the level of the angle of the jaw, and posteriorly to the mastoid process, slightly overlapping the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Embedded in its substance are, the external carotid artery, temporal vein, and facial nerve ; emerging from its anterior border, the transverse facial artery and branches of the facial nerve ; and above, the temporal artery and auriculo-temporal nerve. The duct of the parotid gland (Stenon's* duct), about two inches in length, and about the diameter of a crow's-quill, issues from the anterior part of the gland, just below the zygoma, and crosses the masseter muscle; it then curves inwards over the anterior border of the muscle, and pierces the buccinator opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw; its opening in the mouth being indicated by a prominent papilla. The duct is dense in structure, and its walls of considerable thickness in proportion to the area of the tube, which is remarkably small. A small glandular appendage, the socia parotidis, is con- nected with the upper part of the duct on the masseter muscle; and opens into it by one or several small ducts. The submaxillary gland, rounded in its form, is situated in the posterior part of the submaxillary triangle of the neck. It rests on the hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, and mylo-hyoideus muscle, and is covered in by the body of the lower jaw and the deep cervical fascia. It is separated from the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillary ligament, and from the sublingual gland by the mylo-hyoideus muscle. Embedded among its lobules are the facial artery and submaxillary ganglion. Its excretory duct, Wharton's duct, about two inches in length, issues from the middle of the gland, and passes between the mylo- hyoideus and hyo-glossus to the frsenum. lingua, by the side of which it terminates at the ap*te of a papilla, caruncula sublingualis. A process of the gland is prolonged with the duct for a short distance behind the mylo-hyoideus. The sublingual is a long and flattened gland, situated beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, at each side of the frsenum linguae. It is in relation at the frsenum with its fellow of the opposite side, and in the rest of its course lies between the lower jaw and genio-hyo-glossus, being bounded below by the mylo- hyoideus. It is in relation also with the duct of the submaxillary gland and the hypoglossal nerve. * Nicholas Stenon, an anatomist of great research. He discovered the parotid duct while in Paris. He was appointed Professor of Medicine in Copenhagen in 1672. His work, " De Musculis et Glandulis Observationes," was published in 1664.622 PHARYNX. Its secretion is poured into the mouth by from seven to twenty short ducts, ductus Riviniani, which open on the ridge made by the gland in the floor of the mouth ; the larger openings being situated by the side of thefrsenum linguse. One of the ducts longer than the rest, and opening close to Wharton's duct, has been named ductus Bartholini. Structure.—The salivary glands are of the conglomerate kind, consisting of lobes, which are made up of polyhedral lobules ; and these of smaller lobules ; in minute structure they correspond with the racemose mucous glands. The smallest lobule is composed of glandular vesicles, acini, which are minute csecal pouches, formed by the convolution and dilatation of the extreme ramifications of the ducts. These minute ducts unite to form lobular ducts, and the lobular ducts constitute by their union a single excretory duct. The glandular vesicles are connected by areolar tissue, so as to form a minute lobule ; and the lobules and larger lobes are held together by a more condensed, but lax areolar tissue. The submaxillary and sublingual glands are looser in structure and their lobules larger than those of the parotid gland. The glandular vesicles, about 5^75- of an inch in diameter, consist of a proper external coat or membrana propria, lined by a single layer of spheroidal epithelial cells. The cells are nucleolo-nucleated and contain granules, some of which are fatty and others pig- mentary. The excretory ducts are thick and dense, composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and lined by a layer of columnar epithe- lium ; and Wharton's duct is additionally provided with a longi- tudinal layer of smooth muscular fibre. The secretion of the salivary glands is a clear fluid, sometimes containing a small quan- tity of mucus and the detrita of epithelial cells. Vessels and Nerves.—The parotid gland is abundantly supplied with arteries by the external carotid ; the submaxillary by the facial and lingual ; and the sublingual by the sublingual and sub- mental branches of the lingual artery. The capillaries form net- works around and in contact with the glandular vesicles. The Nerves of the parotid gland are derived from the auriculo- temporal branch of the inferior maxillary, from the auricularis magnus, and from the nervi molles accompanying the external carotid artery. The submaxillary gland is supplied by the branches of the submaxillary ganglion, sympathetic, and filaments from the mylo-hyoidean nerve ; and the sublingual by filaments from the submaxillary ganglion and gustatory nerve. PHARYNX. The pharynx ((pdpvy^, the throat) is a musculo-membranous sac, about four inches in length, situated on the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and extending from the base of the skull to a623 PHARYNX.—(ESOPHAGUS. point corresponding with the cricoid cartilage in front, and the fifth cervical vertebra behind. It is composed of mucous mem- brane, muscles, and a strong aponeurosis ; and communicates in front with the cavity of the nose, mouth, and larynx. Above it is attached, partly by muscle, bub chiefly by aponeurosis, to the basilar process of the occipital bone and petrous portion of the temporal bone, and below it is continuous with the oesophagus. At its anterior part it has opening into it seven foramina, viz.— Posterior nares, two, Eustachian tubes, two, Fig. 235.* Mouth, Larynx, (Esophagus. The Posterior nares (choanse narium) are the two large openings at the upper and front part of the pharynx. On each side of these openings, and parallel with the posterior termination of the infe- rior turbinated bone, is the slit- like opening in the mucous mem- brane, marking the aperture of the Eustachian tube. Beneath the posterior nares is the isthmus faucium, the large opening into the mouth, partly veiled by the soft palate ; and beneath the root of the tongue, the cordiform open- ing of the larynx, aditus ad glos- sidem. The oesophageal opening is the lower constricted portion of the pharynx. (Esophagus.—The oesophagus (oteiv, to bear, <payeiv, to eat) is a slightly flexuous canal, inclining to the left in the neck, to the right in the upper part of the thorax, f and again to the left in its course through the posterior mediastinum ; it commences at the termina- tion of the pharynx, opposite the lower border of the cricoid carti- lage and fifth cervical vertebra, and descends the neck, behind and * Pharynx laid open from behind. 1.

It then passes behind the arch of the aorta and left bronchus, and along the posterior mediastinum, lying in front of the thoracic aorta, to the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, where it enters the abdomen, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach opposite the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra. The oesophagus is flattened and narrow in the cervical region, and cylindrical in the rest of its course ; its largest diameter being met with near the lower part; it is connected by loose areolar tissue to surrounding structures.

On account of the peculiarity of its form, it is divided into a middle part or body, a greater or splenic, and a lesser or pyloric end ; a lesser curvature above, and a greater cur- vature below ; an anterior and a posterior surface ; a cardiac orifice, and a pyloric orifice. The great end (fundus) is not only of large size, but expands beyond the point of entrance of the oesophagus, and is embraced by the concave surface of the spleen ; it presents superiorly a funnel-shaped expansion, leading to the cardiac orifice. The pylorus (janitor) is the small and contracted extremity of the organ ; it is situated on a plane anterior and in- ferior to the cardiac orifice, and lies in contact with the under surface of the liver, often reaching to the gall-bladder. Near the lesser end is a dilatation, the antrum of the pylorus. The two curvatures give attachment to the peritoneum; the upper curve to the lesser omentum, the lower to the great omentum. The anterior surface looks upward and forward, and is in relation with the diaphragm, (which separates it from the viscera of the thorax and six lower ribs,) with the left lobe of the liver, and in the epigastric region with the abdominal parietes. The posterior sur- face looks downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, pancreas, third portion of the duodenum, transverse meso-colon, left kidney, and left supra-renal capsule; this surface forms the anterior boundary of that cul-de-sac of the peritoneum which is situated behind the lesser omentum and extends into the greater omentum. In a state of distension, as after a meal, the an- terior surface becomes superior, and the greater curvature is directed forwards against the abdominal parietes. Meckel estimates the capacity of the stomach at one foot square ; when moderately full it is capable of holding from five to ten pints of fluid. SMALL INTESTINES. The small intestine, intestinum tenue, is about twenty or twenty- five feet in length, and is divisible into three portions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The Duodenum, (called dw8eKa5d,KTv\oj> by Herophilus,) larger and more deeply seated than the rest of the small intestine, has received its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers (eight or ten inches). In its course it presents a horse-shoe curve ; commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the under surface of the liver ; it next descends perpendicularly in front of the right kidney as low as the fourth lumbar vertebra, and then passes nearly transversely across the third lumbar vertebra ; terminating in the jejunum at the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where it is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein. It is connected with the portal eminence s sDUODENUM.—ILEUM. 626 of the liver by means of a baud of peritoneum called ligamentum hepatico-duodenale ; and to the right kidney by another band, the ligamentum duodeno-renale. The first or oblique portion (pars transversa superior) of its course, between two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by the peritoneum : it is in relation, above with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder ; in front with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and behind with the right border of the lesser omentum and its vessels. The second or perpendicular portion (pars descendens) is situated altogether behind the peritoneum : it is in relation by its anterior surface with the commencement of the arch of the colon ; by its posterior surface with the concave margin of the right kidney, the inferior vena cava, and ductus communis choledochus ; by its right border with the ascending colon: and by its left border with the pancreas. The ductus communis choledochus and pancreatic duct open into the internal and posterior side of the perpendicular por- tion, a little below its middle. The third or transverse portion (pars transversa inferior) of the duodenum, the longest and narrowest of the three, lies between the diverging layers of the transverse meso-colon, with which and with the stomach it is in relation in front; above, it is in contact with the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery and vein being interposed; and, behind, it rests on the inferior vena cava and aorta. The Jejunum (jejunus, empty) is named from being generally found empty. It forms the upper two-fifths of the small intes- tine : commencing at the bend of the duodenum, flexura duodeno- jejunalis, on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and termi- nating in the ileum. It is thicker to the touch than the rest of the intestine, has a pinkish tinge from containing more mucous mem- brane than the ileum, and is situated in the umbilical region and left iliac fossa. The Ileum (el\eiv, to twist, to convolute) includes the remaining three-fifths of the small intestine. It is somewhat smaller in calibre, thinner in texture, and paler than the jejunum ; but there is no mark by which to distinguish the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. It is situated in the umbilical and hypogastric region and pelvic. cavity, and terminates in the ri°iit iliac fossa, by opening at an obtuse angle into the commence- ment of the colon. At its entrance into the large intestine it has a cuneiform shape. The small intestines form in their course a double curve resem- bling the letter S, the upper curve to the right representing that of the duodenum ; and the lower to the left that of the jejunum and ileum to the termination of the latter in the colon. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded, above and at the sides, by the colon ; in front they are in relation with the omentum and627 LARGE INTESTINE. abdominal parietes ; they are retained in position by the mesentery, which connects them with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; and below they descend into the cavity of the pelvis. At about the lower third of the ileum a pouch-like process or diverticulum of the intestine is occasionally seen. This is a vestige of embryonic struc- ture, and results from the obliteration of the omphalo-mesenteric or vitelline duct at a short distance from the cylinder of the intes- tine. LARGE INTESTINE. The large intestine (intestinum crassum vel amplum) five or six feet and sometimes more in length, prismoid in form, sacculated and thicker than the small intestine, tapers gradually from above downwards, and is divided into, caecum, colon, and rectum. The Ccecum (caput coli) is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, about two inches and a half in length, situated at the commencement of F'fJ- 23?-* the large intestine. It is lodged in the right iliac fossa, and re- tained in its place by the perito- neum which passes over its ante- rior surface ; its posterior surface is connected by loose areolar tissue with the iliac fascia. At- tached to its extremity is the appendix vermiformis, a long worm-shaped tube, the rudiment of the lengthened csecum found in all mammiferous animals except man and the higher quadrumana. The appendix varies in length from one to five or six inches ; it is about equal in diameter to a goose-quill, and is connected with the posterior and left aspect of the caecum near the extremity of the ileum. It is usually more or less coiled upon itself, and re- tained in that coil by a falciform duplicature of peritoneum. Its canal is extremely small, and the orifice by which it opens into the caecum not unfrequently provided with an incomplete valve.

S s 2628 COIiON.—RECTUM. sionally the peritoneum invests the caecum so completely as to con- stitute a meso-caecum, which permits of an unusual degree of move- ment in this portion of the intestine, and serves to explain the occurrence of hernia of the caecum on the right side. The caecum is the most dilated portion of the large intestine ; and is distin- guished from the colon externally by the constriction corresponding with the entrance of the ileum, and internally by the ileo-caecal or ileo-colic valve. The Colon is divided into, ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending colon passes upwards from the right iliac fossa, through the right lumbar region, to the under surface of the liver. It then bends inwards, flexura dextra vel hepatica, and crosses the upper part of the umbilical region under the name of transverse colon ; and, on the left side, flexura sinistra vel lienalis, descends, descending colon, through the left lumbar region to the left iliac fossa, where it makes a remarkable curve upon itself, which is called the sigmoid flexure, flexura iliaca. The ascending colon, the most dilated portion of the large intes- tine, next the caecum, is retained in position in the abdomen either by the peritoneum passing simply in front of it or by a narrow meso-colon. It is in relation in front with the small intestine and abdominal parietes; behind with the quadratus lumborum muscle and right kidney ; internally with the small intestine and per- pendicular portion of the duodenum ; and by its upper extremity with the under surface of the liver and gall-bladder. The transverse colon, the longest portion of the large intestine, forms a curve across the cavity of the abdomen, the convexity of the curve looking forwards and sometimes downwards. It is in relation, by its upper surf ace, with the liver, gall-bladder, stomach, and lower extremity of the spleen ; by its lower surface, with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and, by its posterior surface, with the transverse meso-colon. The descending colon is smaller in calibre, and situated more deeply than the ascending colon ; its relations are similar. The sigmoid flexure, the narrowest part of the colon, curves up- wards and to the right, then downwards and to the left, and is retained in its place by a meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the small intestine and abdominal parietes ; and behind with the iliac fossa. The Rectum, the termination of the large intestine, seven or eight inches in length, has received its name, not so much from the direction of its course, as from the straightness of its form in com- parison with the colon. It descends, from opposite the left sacro- iliac symphysis, in front of the sacrum, forming a gentle curve to the right side, and then returning to the middle line ; opposite the extremity of the coccyx it curves backwards to terminate in the anus at about an inch in front of the apex of that bone. The629 STRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. rectum, therefore, forms a double flexure in its course, the one being directed from side to side, the other from before backwards. It is smaller in calibre at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, but becomes gradually larger as it descends, and its lower extremity, previously to its termination at the anus, forms a dilatation of con- siderable but variable magnitude. With reference to its relations, the rectum is divided into three portions; the first, including half its length, extends to about the middle of the sacrum, is completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the sacrum by means of the meso-rectum. This por- tion is in relation, above, with the left sacro-iliac symphysis ; and, below, with the branches of the internal iliac artery, sacral plexus of nerves and left ureter; one or two convolutions of the small intestine are interposed between the front of the rectum and the bladder, in the male ; and between the rectum and the uterus with its appendages, in the female. The second portion, about three inches in length, is closely attached to the surface of the sacrum, and covered by peritoneum only in front; it is in relation by its lower part with the base of the bladder, vesiculse seminales, and prostate gland; and in the female with the vagina. The third portion curves backwards from opposite the prostate gland and tip of the coccyx to terminate in the anus ; it is embraced by the levatores ani, and is about one inch and a half in length. This portion is separated from the membranous part of the urethra by a triangular space ; in the female the triangular space intervenes between the vagina and rectum, and constitutes by its base the perineum. The A nus is situated at a little more than an inch in front of the extremity of the coccyx. The integument around it is covered with hairs, and is thrown into numerous radiated plaits which are obliterated during the passage of feces. The margin of the anus is provided with an abundance of sebiparous glands, and the epidermis may be seen terminating by a fringed and scalloped border, at a few lines above the extremity of the opening. STRUCTURE OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. The intestinal canal has four coats :—mucous, submucous or areolar, muscular, and an external coat, which, in the pharynx and oesophagus, is areolo-fibrous, and in the abdominal cavity serous, being derived from the peritoneum. Mucous coat.—The mucous membrane of the mouth is thick, of a pinkish-red colour, semitransparent, furnished with an abun- dance of papilla?, and rich in vessels and nerves. It lines the whole interior of the oral cavity, and is closely adherent to the boundaries of that cavity, in some parts muscle, in others, as upon the jaws and hard palate, bone. It commences, in front, at the junction of the red margin with the skin of the lips, is continuous with theSTRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 630 lining membrane of the parotid, submaxillary and sublingual duets, forms the fraena of the lips, tongue, and epiglottis, lines the folli- cular glands of the tongue and tonsils, and is continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is pale in its lower or alimentary part, but red and thick in its upper or respiratory portion ; the division of the two parts corresponding with the lower border of the soft palate ; the respiratory portion, moreover, is more thickly studded with glands, but is divested of papillae. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with the mucous lining of the Eustachian tubes, nares, mouth, larynx, and (esophagus. In the oesophagus, the mucous membrane is pale red above and whitish below. It has but few papillae, is loosely connected with the muscular coat by means of the submucous coat, and is disposed in longitudinal plicce. In the stomach the mucous membrane is soft and loose, thinner at the cardiac than at the pyloric end, and of a greyish or reddish grey colour, heightened to a bright red during digestion. It is redder in infancy than in the adult, and least red in old age. It is disposed on the surface in plaits or ruga?, which around the cardiac orifice have a radiated arrangement, take a longitudinal direction in the body of the organ, and at the pylorus form a circular or spiral fold, which constitutes with the muscular coat the pyloric valve. The rugae are most numerous and largest at the pyloric end of the stomach. In the small intestine the mucous membrane is thinner than in the stomach ; it is smooth in the upper fourth of the duodenum, but raised into crescentic folds, valvular conniventes, in its lower three-fourths ; the valvulae conniventes being continued throughout the jejunum, and extending as far as the middle of the ileum. On the posterior and inner side of the descending portion of the duo- denum is a longitudinal ridge or crest, plica longitudinalis, about an inch in length, caused by the oblique passage through the walls of the intestine, of the ductus communis choledochus ; and at the lower and most prominent part of this crest is the aperture of ter- mination of that duct and the ductus pancreaticus. The valvulae conniventes are narrow at their commencement, but quickly become larger, and at the lower part of the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum, where they are largest, have a breadth of several lines. In the lower part of the jejunum and upper part of the ileum they become narrower and more scanty, and are finally lost altogether at about the middle of the latter. Each fold or valve extends for about one-half or three-fourths around the cylinder of the intestine ; and as they spring from all sides of its circumference, have the appearance of circular septa. The jejunum owes its con- siderable thickness to these valves ; and as they are small in the upper half of the ileum and wanting in its lower half, the thinness of the ileum is due to their absence.EPITHELIUM. 631 At the termination of the ileum in the large intestine, the mucous membrane forms two semilunar folds, strengthened by the muscular coat. The termination of the ileum is oblique and flattened, and constitutes the division between the caecum and colon, the two folds of mucous membrane being the ileo-ccecal or ileo-colic valve (valvula Bauhini). The position of these folds is such that one belongs to the caecum, the other to the colon, the opening between them being oblong, and oval, and not inaptly com- pared to a button-hole; morever, the colic flap somewhat overlaps the caecal flap, and is so disposed in relation to the entrance of the ileum, that the contents of the small bowel ai-e necessarily dis- charged into the caacum. In the ccecum and colon, the mucous membrane is smooth, and lines the surfaces of the plica; sigmoidem which form the boundaries of the sacculi of the large intestine. In the rectum, it forms three valvular folds,* one of which is situated near the commencement of the intestine ; the second, extending from the side of the tube, is placed opposite the middle of the sacrum ; and the third, which is the largest and most constant, projects from the anterior wall of the bowel opposite the base of the bladder. Besides these folds, the membrane in the empty state of the intestine is thrown into longitudinal plaits, somewhat similar to those of the oesophagus ; these have been named the columns of the rectum. The mucous membrane of the rectum is connected to the muscular coat by a loose areolar tissue, as in the oesophagus. Structure op Mucous Membrane. — In intimate structure mucous membrane is composed of three layers, epithelium, true mucous membrane or corium, and submucous tissue. Epithelium is analogous to the epidermis in forming a layer of protection to the structure which it invests ; it constitutes the sur- face of the mucous membrane, and indeed of all the other internal membranes of the body, namely, the serous and synovial membranes, the heart, the blood-vessels, and lymphatics. Like the epidermis also it is composed of minute cells, generated on the surface of the corium in a soft, transparent, jelly-like substance, filled with small granules, the blastema, which serves besides the purpose of a matrix in connecting the cells together. The blastema, originally fluid, soon becomes filled with organic granules ; these granules congre- gating together in small masses constitute the nucleus, or original part of the cell, the separate granules being the nucleoli. Around the nucleus other granules accumulate and grow, a boundary mem- brane is formed about them, and the cell is complete, consisting of its nucleus with included nucleoli, the cavity of the cell, which is composed of granules and secondary cells, and the cell-membrane. This process of cell-formation being in constant operation on all the surfaces of the body, the old cells of the surface of the epithelium are regularly cast off, while young cells take their place from * Houston, " On the Mucous Membmne of the Eectum." Dublin Hospital Reports, vol. v.632 EPITHELIUM.—SQUAMOUS AND COLUMNAK. Fig. 238.* below. A section of epithelium would, therefore, like the epidermis, show cells in successive stages of formation and growth, namely, as simple granules, aggregated granules or nuclei, small cells, and larger arid complete cells. The cells of epithelium present some differences of form and arrangement which have given rise to their division into four varie- ties, namely, squamous, columnar, spheroidal, and ciliated. The Squamous epithelium is so named from the conversion of its superficial cells into thin, flattened, polyhedral squamse or scales, in which the original structure of the cell, together with its nucleus, is more or less effaced. On the serous membranes of the cavities of the body and on that of the blood and lymph vessels, the squamse form a single layer, but on the mucous membrane, as on the skin, there are several super- imposed layers ; hence the names lamellated, tesselated, stratified, and pavement epithelium have been given to this variety. The squamous epithelium is found on the conjunctiva; in the cavity of the nose near its external aper- tures ; in the mouth, fauces, and lower half of the pharynx; in the oesophagus, where it forms a thick layer, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach by a serrated border, ora serrata ; in the vulva, vagina, cervix uteri, and entrance of the urethra. The squamae are somewhat larger in the mouth and fauces than elsewhere ; in longest diameter they measure between 4^-5- and g^j- of an inch ; in the vagina between -g-J-jr and ; and on the skin -g--^. The nucleus, which is round or oval in shape, and flat- tened, measures in scales from the mouth -g-fnro 0I> an inch. The Columnar epithelium (cylinder epithelium) consists of cells, which have an elongated or pyriform shape, their bases being 2 directed to the free surface, and their apices to the corium. They are ranged side by side like columns, and their interstices are filled with a transparent jelly-like matrix, similar to that which connects the cells of the squamous epi- thelium. * Epithelial scales from the mouth; the large scale, magnified 310 times, exhibits the structure of the scale, as consisting of a nucleus with nucleolus in the centre ; and secondary nucleated cells, forming the body of the scale.

Each column contains near its middle a nucleus, which gives it a swollen appearance, and the nucleus possesses one or more nucleoli; from the transparency of the column the nucleus may ^ig. 240/ be seen through its base. The columnar epithelium occurs in the stomach and bowels, urethra, gall-blad- der, and ducts of glands. In the gall-bladder the nu- cleus is less apparent than in other parts. The Spheroidal epithelium is composed of cells, which^ are spheroidal in shape, and more or less polyhedral from compression ; in other respects they resemble in structure the cells of the preceding varieties. They are found in situations where the squamous and columnar epithelium are continuous, and on that account have been named by Henle transitional epithe- lium. ' The spheroidal epithelium also occurs in the excretory passages of the kidney, the bladder, and in the excretory ducts of the glands which open on the mucous membrane and skin. The Ciliated epithelium is characterized by the presence of minute conical vibratile filaments (cilia) mounted on the broad ends of the columnar cells, or upon the free surface of those of the spheroidal kind. The cilia are in constant action, and produce a wave-like motion, which Fig. Fig.243 Fig. 244. carries the secretions in contact with them towards the outlet of the organ in which they exist. They are found in the nose, and sinuses communicating with the nose ; in the nasal duct; upper or respira- * Columnar epithelium from the small intestine: after Henle.

The epithelium of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal is, therefore, squamous in the mouth, guttural part of the pharynx, and oesophagus ; and columnar in the stomach, intestines, and mucous glands. In the upper or nasal portion of the pharynx the epithelium is columnar and ciliated, as belonging to the apparatus of the air-passages. In the mouth it is thin and continuous at the outer edge of the lips with the epidermis ; in the oesophagus it is thick, and terminates by an abrupt and serrated border, ora serrata, at the cardiac orifice of the stomach ; below this point the epithelium is thin and transparent. The true mucous membrane or coRTUM is analogous to the corium of the skin, and is that part of the mucous coat on which its thickness chiefly depends. In structure it consists of two por- tions ; of a thin transparent surface-layer, the limitary membrane (membrana propria ; basement membrane), and an areolo-vascular portion, which constitutes its chief bulk. It is rich in blood-vessels, and its areolar element varies in quantity in different membranes, and also in different parts of the same membrane ; thus, it is thick in the oesophagus, thin in the stomach and intestines, and thickest in the bladder and vagina. In the limitary membrane and in that part of the corium imme- Fig. 246.f * Portion of the mucous membrane of the stomach, magnified 75 times.

In some of the larger alveoli there are two glands.635 STRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. cliately beneath it, the areolar tissue is in its amorphous and undeveloped condition ; the limitary portion is transparent and structureless, while that immediately beneath it is a transparent matrix containing nuclei and undeveloped cells. The papillae and villi are formed of this material, but have also entering into their structure, smooth muscular fibre and blood-vessels. The smooth muscular fibre forms a thin layer in the deep portion of the mucous membrane in contact with the submucous coat, and is more developed in animals than in man. In the alimentary canal, the surface of the mucous layer presents some diversity of ap- pearance, having reference to the mode of arrangement of the limitary membrane. Thus in the stomach it is raised into a deli- cate network, the minute openings included within the frame of the network being termed alveoli, and this form of mucous mem- brane alveolar. The alveolar mucous membrane is also found in the large intestine, where the alveoli are smaller and the septa thicker than those of the stomach ; in the vesicuke seminales, * Portion of the raucous membrane of the small intestine, magnified 19 times, showing conical villi.

The alveoli of the stomach are polyhedral, for the most part hexagonal in form, and have opening into their floor the mouths of the gastric follicles; in the pyloric end of the stomach, they are oblong in form, and their walls are rendered uneven by the presence of numerous flattened papillae or villi, plica? villosce. In the small intestine, the limitary membrane and subjacent tissue, instead of forming a raised network, is prolonged into pa- pillae, which are termed villi. The villi vary in form, some being conical; others cylindrical, and enlarged at the extremity ; others again triangular or flat and lamellated. They measure in length about ¥V of an inch, and in thickness taper from ^ff to T^ or Ti¥ of an inch, and are so numerous that Krause counted from fifty to ninety within the limits of a square line in the upper part of the intestine; and lower down from forty to seventy; the entire number of villi in the small intestine he estimated at four millions. The villi are situated on every part of the surface of the membrane, both on the valvulae conniventes and between those folds, and when immersed in water they give it the appearance of a fine velvet. There are no villi in the large intestine. The rete of the stomach and large intestine and the villi of the small intestine are both highly vascular ; and, besides the limitary membrane and sublimitary substance, have entering into their structure capillary and lymphatic vessels. The villi have each a small artery and vein, with an intermediate capillary plexus ; but no nerves have as yet been traced into them. The lymphatic or lacteal of each villus probably commences, as Henle has described, by a single cascal vessel. Krause thinks it begins both as a plexus and by several csecal tubes. Areolar coat.—The Submucous or areolar coat (vascular, ner- vous) is a moderately thick stratum of areolar tissue which sustains the vessels, nerves, and glands of the mucous membrane, and con- nects it to the muscular coat; it is thin and dense in the oesophagus ; thicker and more distinct in the stomach ; and thicker than the other coats in the small intestine, where it is loose in texture, devoid of fat, and easily distended with air, excepting at Peyer's glands, where it is closely adherent. It is also thicker in the upper part of the small intestine than below, and is one cause of the greater thickness of the duodenum and jejunum ; moreover, it enters into the structure of the valvules conniventes. Glands.—In the corium and in the loose areolar tissue of the submucous coat, are situated the glands of the mucous membrane. These glands like those of the mucous membrane of the mouth, are of three kinds; tubular glands or simple follicles ; follicular or saccular glands ; and racemose or lobulated glands. The tubular glands or simple follicles are minute caecal tubuli,637 MUCOUS GLANDS. Fig. 249 * Fig. 250.t closely set together, and occupying the whole thickness of the mucous membrane. They are composed of a membrana propria of limitary membrane, and lined by a columnar epithelium, which either invests them throughout as in the simple follicles of the small and large intestine, the cryptce mucosa? of Lieberkiihn ; or occupies only the upper third of their extent, as in the gastric or pepsiniferous glands; the remainder of the tubule being filled with pale finely granular polygonal nucleated cells. The tubular glands of the small and large intestine have the same diameter through- out, while those of the sto- mach, and especially those at the pyloric end, are dilated at the extremity, sometimes flexuous and twisted, occasion- ally bifurcated, and always filled in the deeper part with nucleated cells. The mucous membrane of the pyloric end of the stomach owes its greater thickness to the large size and considerable number of these glands. In the small intestine the tubular glands are so nu- merous as to give to the surface of the membrane between the villi the appearance of a sieve, and around the solitary follicular glands, and the follicular glands of Peyer's patches, they are arranged in circles of six or ten, corona? tubulorum. In the large intestine, they are very closely set, and are also somewhat larger and longer than the tubular glands of the small intestine. The follicular or saccular glands, called also from the shape of their sac, lenticular, and vesicular from their structure, resemble the follicular glands of the tongue already described. They are found in the roof of the pharynx in considerable numbers, and behind the apertures of the Eustachian tubes ; sparingly in the stomach, lenticular glands; and more numerously in the small intestines, where they constitute the glandulse solitarise and Peyer's glands ; and in the large intestine, where they are termed solitary glands. In structure the follicular gland is a closed follicle, sac- * Perpendicular section of the stomach in the pyloric region ; showing- its coats and the gastric glands; from the pig: after Kolliker. 1.

These sacculi are embedded in the substance of the mucous membrane, by which they are surrounded on all sides, and they form a prominence on the surface, which in the small intestine is studded with villi, and surrounded by a zone of simple follicles. The glandulce solitarice, under the name of lenticular glands, are more commonly found in the stomach of children than in the adult; and in the small intestine are also most frequent in children. They 'are met with in every part of the cylinder of the bowel, sometimes singly and sometimes in groups, and more numerously Fig.252.f in the jejunum than in the ileum. In the large intestine, they are grouped closely together in the appendix vermiformis, and are abundant in the csscum and rectum, but less numerous in the colon ; they are larger in the large than in the smal] intestine.

They are found in that portion of the in- testine which is opposite the attachment of the mesentery, and vary in size from half an inch to several inches in length, and from a quarter to half an inch in breadth. To the naked eye they have the appearance of pale disks pierced with numerous small irregular fissures ; but, under the microscope, they are found to be composed of a reticular and alveolar structure. The reticular structure, forming the septa between the alveoli, measures between T^ and of an inch in breadth ; it is highly vascular, and presents on its surface the numerous small angular and oval openings of shallow pits. The alveoli are quadrangular and oblong in form, and measure in longest diameter about ^ of an inch. Their floor is somewhat raised in the centre by a vascular network, and in the foveolae formed by the radiating branches of this vascular network are the openings of numerous simple follicles. The alveoli are considerably less vascular than the reticular structure ; and immediately beneath their floor are the closed vesicles or sacculi which constitute the essential part of the gland. There are commonly twenty or thirty Fig. 253 * * Portion of one of Peyer's glands, magnified 19 times.

Peyer's glands are richly supplied with capillary vessels and lymphatics, which form a plexus around the sacculi, the lymphatics, or rather lacteals, being probably associated with them in function. The racemose or lobulated glands are small yellowish and flat- tened glands, each surrounded by a small capsule of areolar tissue, and situated in the submucous coat of the alimentary canal. They are identical in structure with the racemose glands of the mouth (page 620, figs. 233, 234), and open on the surface of the mucous membrane by means of an excretory duct. They are met with abundantly in the upper part of the pharynx and posterior surface of the soft palate, and around the apertures of the Eustachian tubes, and measure from one-third of a line to a line in diameter. In the oesophagus they are isolated and smaller, and, with the exception of the duodenum, are wanting in the rest of the intestinal canal, namely, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. In the duodenum, however, they are very numerous, extending from the pylorus, where they are most abundant, to the entrance of the ductus communis choledochus. Von Brunn compared them to a second pancreas, and after him they have been named Brunner's glands or duodenal glands. They are situated in the submucous coat of the intestine, immediately beneath the mucous membrane, and each gland is enclosed in a separate capsule of areolar tissue. Their average size is a quarter to half a line, and they secrete a clear alkaline mucus, in which no formed elements, such as cells or nuclei, are present. They take no part in digestion. Besides the above, which are the usually recognised racemose glands of the intestine, I have found others in the small intestine and large intestine, which have hitherto apparently escaped obser- vation. The glands in question are distinctly racemose, have an excretory duct, and are placed so near the surface of the mucous membrane as to be seen distinctly through it; moreover the thin layer of mucous membrane which immediately covers them is non- vascular, or at any rate remained uninjected in the highly injected preparations on which my observations were made. In the large intestine these glands, which I have termed muciparous, occupy the area? of the reticular surface of the mucous membrane (fig. 246), and in the small intestine they are found in patches, in which a similar reticular structure prevails. The muciparous glands of the large intestine occupy the alveoli of the mucous membrane, and constitute the floor of those cavities. They are white, semi-transparent, obscurely lobulated, and pro- vided with an excretory aperture. Commonly, each alveolus has its separate gland; but occasionally, and especially where the641 VESSELS OP MUCOUS MEMBRANE. alveolus is longer than usual, there may be two glands and two excretory apertures. The gland fills the alveolus, rising almost to the level of its brim, and thereby rendering the cavity of the alveolus shallow; the excretory aperture is surrounded by a pro- tuberant lip. The Muciparous glands of the small intestine seem to exist chiefly in the lamellated mucous membrane, and especially on the valvulse conniventes, where they ap- pear to take the place of simple fol- licles. They occur in patches as large as a lentil, but perfectly flat and iden- tical in structure with the mucous membrane of the large intestine, con- sisting of a reticular framework and alveoli. The septa, somewhat thicker than those of the large intestine, mea- sure about -g-jj-g- of an inch in breadth, and contain from two to four rows of minute capillaries, which form a plexus with clbse meshes. The alveoli are polygonal, for the most part hexagonal inform, and somewhat larger than those of the large intestine, measuring between and -^j- of an inch in longest diameter. Each contains a muciparous gland, which forms its floor, and the gland is furnished with a central excretory opening. Around the circumference of the glan- dular patch the reticular structure is imperceptibly lost in the lamellated villi of the mucous membrane. Vessels.—The distribution of the finer arterial vessels and capil- laries in the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal, in relation to the glands, is worthy of attention. The small arteries divide into fine capillaries in the sub- 256-t mucous coat; these fine capillaries enter the spaces between the tubular glands, and form by their communications a plexus around the glands, in their course to the surface. Having * Portion of the free border of one of the valvule conniventes of the jejunum, magnified 19 times, show- ing an alveolar and glandular structure. The mode of transition of the lamellated into the alveolar struc- ture is seen. The alveoli measured ^ of an inch by 3^0, being as large as those of the stomach, and somewhat larger than those of the large intestine; the septa measured between rJ-^ and ^ of an inch in width; the alveoli were shallow, and contained in their floor a mucous gland with an excretory opening. t Circulation in the mucous membrane of the in- testine; after Kolliker. 1.

Hence the glands are provided for their secreting function with fine capillaries, while the capil- laries which contribute to the nutrition and secretion of the surface of the mucous membrane are of a coarser kind. Muscular, coat.—The muscular coat of the pharynx consists of five pairs of muscles, which have been already described. The muscular coat of the rest of the alimentary canal is composed of two planes of fibres, external or longitudinal, and internal or circular. The (Esophagus is very muscular ; its longitudinal fibres com- mence by three fasciculi, two lateral, which are continuous with the inferior constrictor, and one anterior which is attached to the ver- tical ridge of the cricoid cartilage. The circular fibres are attached superiorly to* the cricoid cartilage ; they are transverse in their arrangement above and below, but spiral in the middle of the oesophagus. Below, both sets of fibres are continued upon the stomach. In addition to the proper muscular fibres of the oesophagus, Hyrtl has described two special muscles in connexion with this tube, broncho-oesophageal and pleuro-oesophageal. The Broncho-oeso- phageal muscle arises as a broad fasciculus from the posterior sur- face of the left bronchus, and is lost, after a course of two or three inches in length, among the longitudinal fibres of the left side of the oesophagus. The Pleuro-oesophageal muscle arises from the left wall of the posterior mediastinum behind the commencement of the descending aorta, and curves around that vessel to mingle its fibres with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus. On the Stomach, the longitudinal fibres, descending from the oesophagus, spread out in a radiated manner around the cardiac orifice and great end of the organ, and take their course towards the lesser end ; they are most apparent along the lesser curve. The circular fibres are most abundant at the lesser end, and at the pylorus are aggregated into a thick circular ring, which, with the spiral fold of mucous membrane found in that situation, constitutes the pyloric valve. At the great end of the stomach a new order of fibres is introduced, having for their object to strengthen and com- press that extremity of the organ. They are directed more or less horizontally from the great end towards the lesser end, and are generally lost upon the sides of the stomach at about its middle ; these are the oblique fibres. They are the most internal of the three layers, and most numerous at the upper part of the cul-de-sac, near the cardiac orifice. In the Small intestine, the muscular coat is thicker in the duo- denum and jejunum than in the ileum ; the longitudinal fibres are643 SEROUS COAT OF THE INTESTINE. most numerous along the free border of the intestine ; and the circular fibres are more or less oblique in direction. At the termi- nation of the ileum the circular fibres are continued into the two folds of the ileo-csecal valve, while the longitudinal fibres pass onwards to the large intestine. In the Large intestine, the longitudinal fibres commence at the appendix vermiformis, and are collected into three bands, anterior, broad ; and two posterior and narrower bands. These bands, the ligamenta coli, are nearly one-half shorter than the intestine, and serve to maintain the sacculated structure of the caecum and colon. In the descending colon the posterior bands usually unite and form a single band. From this point the bands are continued down- wards upon the sigmoid flexure to the rectum, around which they spread out and form a thick and very muscular longitudinal layer. The circular fibres in the caecum and colon are thin ; in the rectum they are thicker, and near its lower extremity are aggregated into the thick muscular band which is known as the internal sphincter ani. Between the latter and the mucous membrane are several narrow fasciculi of longitudinal muscular fibres, somewhat more than an inch in length, which have been described by Horner of Philadelphia. The muscular fibres of the alimentary canal are of the smooth kind, excepting at the commencement and termination, where they are striated ; the striated fibres form the chief bulk of the muscular coat of the oesophagus, as far as the thorax, they then become smooth, first in the circular and then in the longitudinal layer. In the lower fourth, the smooth muscular fibres predominate, but a few isolated striated fibres are met with as low down as the cardia. In the lower part of the rectum, the striated fibres again make their appearance, and increase in numbers to its extremity. Serous coat.—The pharynx and oesophagus have no covering of serous membrane, but in its place a strong fibrous membrane com- posed of areolar tissue and elastic fibres. The alimentary canal within the abdomen has a serous layer, derived from the peri- toneum. The Stomach is completely surrounded by peritoneum, excepting along the line of attachment of the great and lesser omentum. The first or oblique portion of the duodenum is also completely included by the serous membrane, with the exception of the points of attach- ment of the omenta. The descending portion has only a partial covering on its anterior surface, derived from the right meso-colon. The transverse portion is also behind the peritoneum, being situated between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon, and has but a partial covering. The rest of the small intestine is completely invested by it, excepting along the concave border, margo mesen- terialis, to which the mesentery is attached. The cazcum is more or less invested by the peritoneum, the more frequent disposition t t 2644 THE LIVEE. being that in which the intestine is surrounded for three-fourths only of its circumference- The ascending and descending colon are covered by the serous membrane only in front. The transverse colon is invested completely, with the exception of the lines of attachment of the greater omentum and transverse meso-colon. And the sig- moid flexure is entirely surrounded, with the exception of the part corresponding with the junction of the left meso-colon. The upper third of the rectum is completely enclosed by the peritoneum ; the middle third has an anterior covering only, and the inferior third none whatsoever. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the alimentary canal, as they supply the tube from above downwards, are, the pterygo- palatine, ascending pharyngeal, superior thyroid, and inferior thyroid, in the neck ; oesophageal in the thorax ; gastric, hepatic, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, in the abdomen ; and inferior mesenteric, internal iliac, and internal pudic, in the pelvis. The veins from the abdominal alimentary canal unite to form the vena portse. The lymphatics and lacteals open into the thoracic duct. The Nerves of the pharynx and oesophagus are derived from the glossopharyngeal, pneumogastric, and sympathetic. The nerves of the stomach are the pneumogastric, and sympathetic branches from the solar plexus ; and those of the intestinal canal are the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. The extremity of the rectum is supplied by the inferior sacral nerves from the spinal cord. THE LIVER. The liver is a conglomerate gland of large size, appended to the alimentary canal, and performing the double office of separating im- purities from the venous blood of the chylopoietic viscera-previously to its return into the general venous circulation, and of secreting a fluid necessary to chylification, the bile. It is the largest organ in the body, weighing about four pounds, and measuring through its longest diameter about twelve inches. It is situated in the right hypochondriac region, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondrium, frequently reaching, by its left extremity, the upper end of the spleen. It is placed obliquely in the abdomen ; its convex surface looking upwards and forwards, the concave downwards and backwards. The anterior border is sharp and free, and marked by a deep notch, and the posterior rounded and broad. It is in relation, superiorly and posteriorly with the diaphragm ; inferiorly with the stomach, ascending portion of the duodenum, transverse colon, right supra-renal capsule, and right kidney ; and corresponds, by its free border, with the lower margin of the ribs. Ligaments.—The liver is retained in its place by five ligaments, four of which are duplicatures of the peritoneum, situated on the645 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER. convex surface of the organ ; the fifth is a fibrous cord which passes through a fossa in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava. They are the— The Longitudinal ligament (broad, ligamentum suspensorium hepatis) is an antero-posterior fold of peritoneum, extending from the notch in the anterior margin of the liver to its posterior border. Between its two layers, in the anterior and' free margin, is the round ligament. The Lateral ligaments are formed by the two layers of perito- neum, which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior border of the liver ; they correspond with its lateral lobes. The Coronary ligament is formed by the separation of the two layers forming the lateral ligaments near their point of convergence. The posterior layer is continued unbroken from one lateral ligament to the other; but the anterior quits the posterior at each side, and is continuous with the corresponding layer of the longitudinal liga- ment. In this way a large oval surface on the posterior border of the liver is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the diaphragm by areolar tissue. This space is formed principally by the right lateral ligament, and is pierced near its left extremity * Upper surface of the liver. 1. Eight lobe. 2. Left lobe. 3. Anterior or free border. 4.

The Round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the oblite- ration of the umbilical vein, and situated between the two layers of peritoneum in the anterior border of the longitudinal ligament. It may be traced from the umbilicus through the longitudinal fossa of the under surface of the liver to the inferior vena cava, to which it is connected. Fossce.—The under surface of the liver is marked by five fossae, which divide its surface into five compartments or lobes, two principal and three minor lobes ; they are the— The Longitudinal fossa or fissure is a deep groove running from the notch, incisura umbilicalis, in the anterior margin of the liver, to the posterior border of the organ. At about one-third from its posterior extremity it is joined by a short but deep fossa, the transverse, which meets it transversely from the under part of the right lobe. The longitudinal fossa in front of this junction lodges the fibrous cord of the umbilical vein, and is generally crossed by a band of hepatic substance called the pons hepatis. The Fossa for the ductus venosus is the shorter portion of the longitudinal fossa, extending from the junctional termination of the transverse fossa to the posterior border of the liver, and con- taining a small fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus venosus. This fossa is therefore but a part of the longitudinal fossa. The Transverse fossa is the short and deep fossa, about two inches in length, through which the hepatic ducts quit and the hepatic artery and portal vein enter the liver. Hence this fossa was considered by the older anatomists as the gate of the liver, porta hepatis ; and the large vein entering the organ at this point, the portal vein. At their entrance into the transverse fossa the branches of the hepatic duct are the most anterior, next those of the artery, and most posteriorly the portal vein. The Fossa for the gall-bladder is a shallow depression extending forwards, parallel with the longitudinal fossa, from the right ex- tremity of the transverse fossa to the free border of the liver, where it frequently forms a notch, incisura vesicalis. The Fossa for the vena cava is a deep and short fissure, occa- sionally a circular tunnel, which proceeds from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fossa to the posterior border of the liver, and lodges the inferior vena cava.

It is marked on its under surface by the transverse fossa, and by the fossge for the gall-bladder and vena cava ; and presents three depressions, one, in front, for the curve of the ascending colon, impressio colica, and two behind, for the right supra-renal capsule and kidney, impressio renalis.

It is sometimes in contact by its extremity with the upper end of the spleen, and is in relation, by its posterior border, with the cardiac orifice of the stomach and left pneumo- gastric nerve. The Lobus quadratics is a quadrilateral lobe situated on the under surface of the right lobe : it is bounded, in front, by the free border of the liver ; behind, by the transverse fossa ; to the right, by the gall-bladder ; and to the left, by the longitudinal fossa. The Lobus Spigelii* is a small triangular lobe, also situated on the under surface of the right lobe : it is bounded, in front, by the transverse fossa; and, on the sides, by the fossse for the ductus venosus and vena cava. The Lobus caudatus is a small tail-like appendage of the lobus Spigelii, from which it runs outwards like a crest into the right lobe, and serves to separate the right extremity of the transverse fossa from the commencement of the fossa for the vena cava. In some persons this lobe is well marked, in others it is small and ill-defined. Eeverting to the comparison of the fossa? with an inverted \f, it will be observed, that the quadrilateral interval, in front of the transverse bar, represents the lobus quadratus : the triangular space behind the bar, the lobus Spigelii; and the apex of the letter, the point of union between the inferior vena cava and the obliterated cord of the ductus venosus. Vessels and Nerves.—The vessels entering into the structure of the liver are also five in number; they are the— Hepatic artery, Hepatic veins, Lymphatics. Portal vein, Hepatic ducts, The Hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, enter the liver at the transverse fossa, and ramify through portal canals to every part of the organ ; so that their general direction is from below upwards, and from the centre towards the circumference. The Hepatic veins commence at the circumference, and proceed from before backwards, to open into the vena cava at the posterior border of the liver. Hence the branches of the two veins cross each other in their course. The portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct are moreover enveloped in a loose areolar tissue, the capsule of Glisson, which permits them to contract upon themselves when emptied of their contents ; the hepatic veins, on the contrary, are closely adherent by their parietes to the surface of the canals in which they run, and are unable to contract. By these characters the anatomist is enabled, in any section of the liver, to distinguish at once the most minute * Adrian Spigel, a Belgian physician, professor at Padua after Casserius in 1616.

Structure and Minute Anatomy of the Liver. The Liver is composed of lobules, of a connecting medium, called Glisson's capsule, of the ramifications of the portal vein, hepatic duct, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves, Fig. 259.* and is enclosed and retained in its situation by the peritoneum. The Lobules are small granu- lar bodies of about the size of a millet seed, of irregular form, and presenting a number of rounded prominences on their surface. When divided longi- tudinally, they have a foliated appearance, and transversely, a polygonal outline, with sharp or rounded angles, according to the smaller or greater quantity of Grlisson's capsule contained in the liver. Each lobule is divided on its exterior into a base and a capsular surface. The base corresponds with one extremity of the lobule, is flattened, and rests on an hepatic vein, which is thence named sublobular. The capsular surface includes the rest of the periphery of the lobule, and has received its designation from being enclosed in an areolar capsule derived from the capsule of Glisson. In the centre of each lobule is a small vein, the intralobular, which is formed by the convergence of six or eight minute venules from the * Lobules of the liver.

The intralobular vein thus constituted takes its course through the centre of the longitudinal axis of the lobule, pierces the middle of its base, and opens into the sublobular vein. The periphery of the lobule, with the exception of its base, which is always closely attached to a sublobular vein, is connected by means of its areolar capsule, with the capsular surface of surrounding lobules. The interval between the lobules is the interlobular fissure, and the augular interstices formed by the appo- sition of several lobules are the interlobular spaces. The lobules of the centre of the liver are angular, and somewhat smaller than those of the surface, from the greater compression to which they are submitted. The superficial lobules are incomplete, and give to the surface of the organ the appearance of a transverse section. In ultimate structure the lobule is composed of hepatic cells or corpuscles and a vascular plexus which receives its blood exteriorly from an interlobular bi-anch of the portal vein and transmits it in- ternally to the intralobular vein, the radicle of the hepatic vein ; no ducts are found in the lobule ; these latter, with the branches of the hepatic artery, being situated in the intervals of the lobules or interlobular fissures. The hepatic cells or corpuscles are nucleolo- nucleated cells, of a polyhedral figure, measuring about ^5-5- of an inch in diameter, and of a pale amber colour. They are composed of a thin proper membrane, enclosing granular, semi-fluid contents, which are yellowish in colour, and the essential constituents of the bile ; moreover, there are often found within the hepatic cell, besides the nucleus, a greater or less number of brownish yellow * Hepatic cells, magnified 310 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. t Arrangement of the hepatic cells in a cell network, and the mode of origin of the hepatic ducts; after Kolliker. 1,1.

The hepatic cells are arranged in the form of a network, the meshes of the net- work corresponding with the vascular plexus, and the columns or solid portions of the network constituting the secretory portion of the gland. The lobules are, therefore, composed of cells and capil- lary vessels, closely applied to each other, and the secretion of bile is effected by the exudation of the fluid elements of the bile from the vessels into the cells. The biliary ducts originate by csecal ex- tremities among the hepatic cells of the exterior of the lobule, and the next step in the process of secretion is the transmission of the bile from the hepatic cells to the biliary ducts. Glisson's capsule is the areolar tissue which envelopes the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, during their passage through the transverse fossa, and which continues to surround them to the interlobular fissures. It connects all the lobules together, and constitutes the proper capsule of the entire organ. Grlisson's capsule " is to the liver what the pia mater is to the brain ; it is a cellulo-vascular membrane, in which the vessels divide and sub- divide to an extreme degree of minuteness ; which lines the portal canals, ;forming sheaths for the larger vessels contained in them, and a web in which the smaller vessels ramify;"* and which enters the interlobular fissures. Hence arises a division of the capsule into two portions, vaginal and interlobular. The vaginal portion is that which invests the hepatic artery, hepatic duct, and portal vein, in the portal canals; in the large canals it completely surrounds these vessels, but in the smaller is situated only on that side which is occupied by the artery and duct ; while the interlobular portion occupies the interlobular fissures and spaces. The Portal vein, entering the liver at the transverse fossa, rami- fies through its structure in canals, which resemble, by their sur- faces, the external superficies of the liver, and are formed by the capsular surface of the lobules. These are the portal canals, and contain, besides the portal vein with its ramifications, the artery and duct with their branches. In the larger canals, the vessels are separated from the parietes by a web of Grlisson's capsule ; but in the smaller, the portal vein is in contact with the surface of the canal for about two-thirds of its cylinder, the opposite third being in relation with the artery and duct and their investing capsule. If, therefore, the portal vein were laid open by a longitudinal incision in one of these smaller canals, the coats being transparent, the outline of the lobules, bounded by their interlobular fissures, would be as distinctly seen as on the external surface of the liver, and the smaller venous branches would be observed entering the interlobular spaces. * " The Anatomy and Physiology of the Liver," by Kiernan," Phil. Trans." 1833, from which this and the other paragraphs within inverted commas, on the structure of the liver, are quoted.652 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. The branches of the portal vein are, vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The vaginal branches are those which, being given off in the portal canals, have to pass through the sheath (vagina) of Grlisson's capsule, previously to entering the interlobular spaces. In this course they form an intricate plexus, vaginal plexus, in the capsule of Gflisson, and this plexus surrounds the vessels, as does the capsule in the larger canals, and occupies the capsular side only in the smaller canals. The interlobular branches are given off from the vaginal portal plexus where it exists, and directly from the portal veins, in that part of the smaller canals where the coats of the vein are in contact with the walls of the canal. They then enter the interlobular spaces and divide into branches, which cover with their ramifications every part of the surface of the lobules, with the exception of their bases and those extremities of the super- ficial lobules which appear on the surfaces of the liver. The lobular branches are derived from the interlobular veins ; they form a plexus within each lobule, and converge from the circum- ference towards the centre, where they terminate in the minute radicles of the intralobular vein. " This plexus, interposed between the interlobular portal veins and the intralobular hepatic vein, constitutes the venous part of the lobule, and may be called the lobular venous plexus." The regular islets of the substance of the lobules, seen between the meshes of this plexus by means of the microscope, are the acini of Malpighi, and are the network of hepatic cells. The portal vein returns the venous blood from the chylopoietic viscera, to be circulated through the lobules ; it also receives the blood which results from the distribution of the hepatic artery. The Hepatic duct, entering the liver at the transverse fossa, divides into branches, which ramify through the portal canals, with the portal vein and hepatic artery, to terminate in the interlobular fissures ; its branches are, vaginal and interlobular. The Vaginal branches ramify through the capsule of Grlisson, and form a vaginal biliary plexus, which, like the vaginal portal plexus, surrounds the vessels in the large canals, but is deficient on that side of the smaller canals against which the duct is placed. The interlobular branches proceed from the vaginal biliary plexus, where it exists, and directly from the bepatic duct on that side of the smaller canals against which the duct is placed. They enter the interlobular spaces, and ramify between the lobules in the in- terlobular fissures, where they end by csecal extremities. The coats of the duct are very vascular, and supplied with a number of mucous glands, which are distributed irregularly in the larger, but are arranged in two parallel longitudinal rows in the smaller ducts. The Hepatic artery enters the liver with the portal vein and hepatic duct, and ramifies with those vessels through the portal canals. Its branches are, vaginal and interlobular. The vaginal653 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. branches, like those of the portal vein and hepatic duct, form a vaginal plexus, which exists throughout the whole extent of the portal canals, with the exception of that side of the smaller canals which corresponds with the artery. The interlobular branches, arising from the vaginal plexus and from the parietal side of the artery (in the smaller canals), ramify through the interlobular fissures, and are principally distributed to the coats of the inter- lobular ducts. "From the superficial interlobular fissures small arteries emerge, and ramify in the proper capsule, on the convex and concave sur- face of the liver, and in the ligaments. These are the capsular arteries." Where the capsule is well developed, " these vessels cover the surfaces of the liver with a beautiful plexus, and anasto- mose with branches of the phrenic, internal mammary, and supra- renal arteries," and with the epigastric. The venous blood result- ing from the distribution of the hepatic artery is returned into the portal vein. The Hepatic veins commence in the substance of each lobule by minute venules, which receive the blood from the lobular venous plexus, and converge to form the intralobular vein. The intra- lobular vein passes through the central axis of the lobule, and through the middle of its base, .to terminate in a sublobular vein ; and the union of the sublobular veins constitutes the hepatic trunks, which open into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic venous system consists, therefore, of three sets of vessels ; intralobular veins, sub- lobular veins, and hepatic trunks. The Sublobular veins are contained in canals formed solely by the bases of the lobules, with which, from the absence of Glisson's capsule, they are in immediate contact. Their coats are thin and transparent; and, if they be laid open by a longitudinal incision, the bases of the lobules will be distinctly seen, separated by inter- lobular fissures, and perforated through the centre by the opening of the intralobular vein. The Hepatic trunks are formed by the union of the sublobular veins ; they are contained in canals (hepatic-venous) similar in structure to the portal canals, and lined by a prolongation of the proper capsule. They proceed from before backwards, and termi- nate, by two large openings (corresponding with the right and left lobe of the liver) and several smaller apertures, in the inferior vena cava. Summary.—The liver has been shown to be composed of lobules; the lobules (excepting at their bases) are connected together, the vessels supported, and the whole organ enclosed, by Glissorfs cap- sule ; and they are so arranged, that the base of every lobule "in the liver is in contact with an hepatic vein (sublobular). The Portal vein distributes its numberless branches through portal canals, which are channeled through every part of the organ ; it brings the returning blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; itSTRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 654 collects also the venous blood from the ultimate ramifications of the hepatic artery in the liver itself. It gives off branches in the canals, which are called vaginal, and form a venous vaginal plexus ; these give off interlobular branches, and the latter enter the lobules aud form lobular venous plexuses, from the blood circulating in which the bile is secreted. The Bile is received from the hepatic cells by the interlobular ducts ; it is thence poured into the biliary vaginal plexus of the portal canals, and thence into the excreting ducts, by which it is carried to the duodenum and gall-bladder, after being mingled in its course with the mucous secretion from numberless muciparous glands in the walls of the ducts. The Hepatic artery distributes branches through every portal canal ; gives off vaginal branches which form a vaginal hepatic plexus, from which the interlobular branches arise, and these latter terminate ultimately in the lobular venous plexuses of the portal vein. The artery ramifies abundantly in the coats of the hepatic ducts, enabling them to provide their mucous secretion ; and sup- plies the vasa vasorum of the portal and hepatic veins, and the nutrient vessels of the entire organ. The Hepatic veins commence in the centre of each lobule by minute radicles, which collect the impure blood from the lobular venous plexus and convey it into the intralobular veins; these open into the sublobular veins, and the sublobular veins unite to form the large hepatic trunks by which the blood is carried into the vena cava. Physiological and pathological deductions.—The physiological deduction arising out of this anatomical arrangement is, that the bile is wholly secreted from venous blood, and not from a mixed venous and arterial blood, as stated by Miiller ; for although the portal vein receives its blood from two sources, viz., from the chylo- poietic viscera and from the capillaries of the hepatic artery, yet the fact of the blood of the latter vessel having passed through its capillaries into the portal vein, or in extremely small quantity into the capillary network of the lobular venous plexus, is sufficient to establish its venous character.* The pathological deductions depend on the following facts :— Each lobule is a perfect gland ; of uniform structure, of uniform colour, and possessing the same degree of vascularity throughout. It is the seat of a double venous circulation, the vessels of the one (hepatic) being situated in the centre of the lobule, and those of the other (portal) in the circumference. Now the colour of the lobule, as of the entire liver, depends chiefly on the proportion of blood contained within these two sets of vessels ; and so long as the circulation is natural, the colour will be uniform. But the instant that any cause is developed which shall interfere with the * For arguments on this contested question, see the article " Liver," in the " Cyclopedia of Anatomy and Physiology."655 GALL-BLADDER. free circulation of either, there will be an immediate diversity in the colour of the lobule. Thus, if there be any impediment to the free circulation of the venous blood through the heart or lungs, the circulation in the he- patic veins will be retarded, and the sublobular and the intralobular veins will become congested, giving rise to a more or less extensive redness in the centre of each of the lobules, while the marginal or non-congested portion presents a distinct border of a yellowish white, yellow, or green colour, according to the quantity or quality of the bile it may contain. "This is 'passive congestion' of the liver, the usual and natural state of the organ after death ;" and, as it com- mences with the hepatic vein, it may be called the first stage of hepatic-venous congestion. But if the causes which produced this state of congestion continue, or be from the beginning of a more active kind, the congestion will extend through the lobular venous plexuses " into those branches of the portal vein situated in the interlobular fissures, but not to those in the spaces, which being larger, and giving origin to those in the fissures, are the last to be congested." In this second stage the liver has a mottled appearance, the non-congested substance is arranged in isolated, circular, and ramose patches, in the centres of which the spaces and parts of the fissures are seen. This is an extended degree of hepatic venous congestion; it is (i active con- gestion " of the liver, and very commonly attends disease of the heart and lungs. These are instances of partial congestion, but there is sometimes general congestion of the organ. " In general congestion the whole liver is of a red colour, but the central portions of the lobules are usually of a deeper hue than the marginal portions." GALL-BLADDER. The Gall-bladder (fig. 170) is the reservoir of the bile ; it is a pyriform sac, situated in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and extending from the right extremity of the transverse fossa to the free margin. It is divided into a body, fundus, and neck : the fundus or broad extremity in the natural position of the liver is placed downwards, and frequently projects beyond the free margin of the liver, while the neck, small and con- stricted, is directed upwards. This sac is composed of three coats, serous, fibrous, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, is derived from the peritoneum, and covers that side only which is unattached to the liver. The middle or fibrous coat is a thin but strong fibrous layer, composed of dense areolar tissue, and connected on the one side with the liver, on the other with the peritoneum. There also exists in this layer a stratum of smooth muscular fibres, which are longitudinal and circular in direction. The internal or mucous coat is but loosely attached to the fibrous layer; it is everywhereTHE PANCREAS. 656 raised into minute ruga?, which give it a beautifully reticulated appearance ; and it forms, at the neck of the sac, a spiral valve. It is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous mem- brane lining the ducts of the liver, and through the ductus com- munis choledochus, with the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. It is coated on its surface with a columnar epithelium. The Biliary ducts are, the hepatic, cystic, and ductus communis choledochus. The Hepatic duct, nearly two inches long, is formed in the trans- verse fossa of the liver by the junction of two ducts which proceed from the right and left lobe. It joins the cystic duct at an acute angle, and the common duct resulting from their union is the ductus communis choledochus. The Cystic duct, about an inch in length, passes inwards from the neck of the gall-bladder, and unites at an acute angle with the preceding. The Ductus communis choledochus (%o\t?, bills, dixo/uai, recipio) is the common excretory duct of the liver and gall-bladder; it is about three inches in length, and is formed by the junction of the hepatic with the cystic duct. It descends through the right border of the lesser omentum, and behind the descending portion of the duodenum to the inner side of that intestine, where it terminates by passing obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat, and opening on the summit of a papilla which is common to it and the pancreatic duct. The papilla is situated near the lower part of the descending portion of the duodenum at its inner side ; and the duct is constricted in size during its passage between the coats of the intestine. The coats of the biliary ducts are an external or fibrous, and an internal or mucous coat. The external coat is composed of dense areolar tissue, containing many nuclei, and elastic tissue. The mucous coat, continuous on the one hand with the lining membrane of the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and on the other with that of the duodenum, is furnished with a columnar epithelium. A few smooth muscular fibres have been observed in the mucous coat; but there is no special muscular coat. Vessels and Nerves.—The gall-bladder is supplied with blood by the cystic artery, a branch of the hepatic. Its veins return their blood into the portal vein. The nerves are derived from the hepatic plexus. THE PANCREAS. The pancreas is a long, flattened, conglomerate gland, analogous to the salivary glands. It is about six inches in length, and be- tween three and four ounces in weight; is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the stomach, and rests on the aorta, vena portse, inferior vena cava, the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and the left kidney and supra-renal657 THE PANCREAS. capsule ; opposite the first and second lumbar vertebra. It is divided into a body, a greater, and a smaller extremity ; the great end or head is placed towards the right, and surrounded by the curve of the duodenum ; the lesser end extends to the left as far as the spleen. The anterior surface of the body of the pancreas is covered by the ascending posterior layer of peritoneum, and is in relation with the stomach, the first portion of the duodenum, and the commencement of the transverse arch of the colon. The posterior surface is grooved for the splenic vein, and tunneled by a complete canal for the superior mesenteric and portal vein, and superior mesenteric artery. The upper border presents a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the splenic artery and vein, and is in relation with the oblique portion of the duodenum, lobus Spigelii, and coeliac axis. And the lower border is separated from the transverse por- tion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and vein. On the posterior part of the head of the pancreas is a lobular fold of the gland which completes the canal of the superior mesenteric vessels, and is called the lesser pancreas. The pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung) commences at the small extremity of the organ by two branches, which converge and unite after a course of about one-third the length of the gland. The duct is then continued onwards from left to right, gradually increasing in size, and lying nearer the anterior than the posterior surface of the organ, to the lower part of the descending duodenum, where it terminates on the papilla of mucous membrane, common to it and the ductus communis choledochus. The duct receives numerous branches which open into it on all sides from the lobules of the gland, and at its termination is slightly dilated and passes obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat of the intestine to reach the papilla. The duct which receives the secretion from the lesser pancreas is called the ductus pancreaticus minor; it opens into the principal duct near the duodenum, and sometimes passes separately into that intestine. As a variety, two pancreatic ducts are occa- sionally met with. In structure the pancreas presents the ordinary composition of a compound racemose gland, being made up of lobes, and these of reddish-yellow polyhedral lobules, which latter consist of smaller lobules, and the smallest lobules of the ramifications of minute ducts, terminating in glandular vesicles. The glandular vesicles are rounded in form (fig. 233), and composed of a membrana propria, lined by a spheroidal epithelium of nucleated cells ; the cells being somewhat opake from the presence of fat granules as part of their contents. The ducts are composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and lined by a columnar epithelium. In the walls of the ducts are numerous small racemose mucous glands like those in the hepatic ducts. The secretion of the pancreas is a clear fluid, without formed elements. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the pancreas are branches u u658 THE SPLEEN. of tliesplenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric; the veins open into the splenic vein ; the lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are filaments of the splenic plexus. THE SPLEEN. The spleen is an oblong flattened organ, of a dark bluish-red colour, situated in the left hypochondriac region. It is variable in size and weight,* spongy and vascular in texture, and exceedingly friable. The external surface is convex, the internal slightly con- cave, indented along the middle line, and pierced by several large and irregular openings for the entrance and exit of vessels ; this is the hilum lienis. The upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower, and rounded; the inferior is flattened ; the posterior border is obtuse, the anterior sharp, and marked by several notches. The spleen is in relation by its external or convex surface with the diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh rib ; by its concave surface, with the great end of the stomach, small extremity of the pancreas, gastro-splenic omentum with its vessels, left kidney and supra-renal capsule, and left crus of the diaphragm ; by its upper end with the diaphragm, and sometimes with the extremity of the left lobe of the liver ; and, by its lovjer end, with the left extremity of the transverse arch of the colon. It is connected to the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum, and to the diaphragm by a fold of the peritoneum called the suspensory Ligament. A second spleen (lien succenturiatus) is sometimes found appended to one of the branches of the splenic artery, near the great end of the stomach ; when it exists, it is round and of small size, rarely larger than a hazel-nut. There are sometimes two, and even three, of these bodies. The spleen is a blood-vascular gland, concerned in the renovation of the blood, and probably in the preparation of the blood for the secretion of bile. In structure it is composed of a fibrous and serous coat and parenchyma ; the parenchyma consisting of a network of fibrous bands, or trabecules, enclosing in their arese a bright red pulpy substance, the splenic pulp; and the latter containing an abundance of vessels and numerous small white corpuscles, the splenic or Malpighian corpuscles. The fibrous coat, tunica albu- ginea vel propria, is composed of areolar and elastic tissue, and besides investing the exterior, sends processes into the interior of the gland with the blood-vessels ; these fibrous sheaths (vaginse vasorum) accompany the vessels to their ultimate terminations, and finally constitute a fine areolar network in the substance of the splenic pulp. The fibrous coat also sends inwards from every part of its internal surface, a number of white, glistening, flattened * Its ordinary length is about live inches; and its weight six ounces.THE SPLEEN. .659 Fig. 263. or cylindrical bands, the splenic trabeculce, which traverse the substance of the gland in all directions, and are attached by their inner ends to each other and to the fibrous sheaths of the vessels. The splenic or Malpighian corpuscles or vesicles are small white roundish bodies, embedded in the splenic pulp, and connected with the twigs of the small arteries. They are found only in the fresh and healthy spleen, and are more con- stant in children than the adult; their average size is one-sixth of a line, and they are found in numbers varying from five to ten on each small arterial twig. In intimate structure, the splenic corpuscle is a vesicle composed of a membrana propria and greyish pulpy granular con- tents. The menibrana propria is trans- parent and colourless, moderately thick, consisting of homogeneous areolar tissue with elastic fibrils, and closely connected with the fibrous sheath of the artery. The greyish contents are thick and viscid, and made up of pale round nucleated cells, free nuclei, and a small proportion of clear albuminous fluid. The splenic corpuscles would seem to be analogous to the closed vesicles of the follicular glands, as the tonsils, solitary glands, and Peyer's glands ; and to the lymphatic glands. In support of this view, Kolliker thinks that he saw a vascular plexus in the splenic corpuscles of the cat; like that which has been described as existing in the vesicles of Peyer's glands. On the other hand, there is no apparent relation be- tween the lymphatic vessels and these corpuscles. The splenic pulp fills the interstices of the trabecule, is of a bright red colour, like currant jelly, and is com- posed of a delicate areolar networJc, formed by the smaller trabeculse and vascular sheaths ; of minute blood-vessels; and of nucleated cells (parenchyma cells) similar to those of the splenic corpuscles, and Fig. 264.f * Arterial twig of the splenic artery, showing the connexion of the splenic corpuscles with the small vessels.

Besides which there are also met with other cells with single and multiple nuclei, and of various size, intermingled with blood corpuscles in various stages of degradation ; and pigmentary granules. The cells are for the most part collected together into small aggregated masses of various dimensions. Vessels and Nerves.—The splenic artery is of a very large size in proportion to the bulk of the spleen; it is a division of the cceliac axis. The branches which enter the spleen are distributed to dis- tinct sections of the organ, and anastomose very sparingly with each other ; they terminate in elegant bundles or penicilli of minute straight arteries, which end in a capillary network, and the latter forms a plexus throughout the substance of the parenchyma, and around the splenic corpuscles. The veins, by their numerous dilatations, constitute the principal part of the bulk of the spleen; they pour their blood into the splenic vein, which is one of the two great formative trunks of the portal vein. The lymphatics, few in number, are superficial and deep ; the former are situated between the coats of the gland ; the latter issue from its substance through the hilum, and terminate by means of a trunk in the thoracic duct. The nerves are, the splenic plexus, derived from the solar plexus. THE SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The supra-renal capsules or glandular supra-renales are two small yellowish and flattened bodies surmounting the kidneys, and inclining inwards towards the vertebral column. The right is some- what three-cornered in shape, the left semilunar; they are connected to the kidneys by the common investing areolar tissue, and each capsule is marked on its anterior surface by a fissure or hilum which appears to divide it into two lobes. The right supra-renal capsule is closely adherent to the posterior and under surface of the liver, the left lies in contact with the pancreas and spleen. Both capsules rest against the crura of the diaphragm on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, and by their inner border are in relation with the great splanchnic nerve and semilunar ganglion. They are larger in the foetus than in the adult, and appear to perform some office specially connected with embryonic life. The anatomy of these organs in the foetus will be found in the succeeding chapter. In structure the supra-renal capsule is composed of a cortical and medullary substance, and invested by a firm but thin coat of areolar tissue, which sends fine processes inwards through its interior. The cortical substance is of a yellowish-white colour externally, and brownish within, consists of straight parallel columns arranged perpendicularly to the surface, and is somewhat friable, breaking in the direction of these columns. The medullary substance, twice or three times the thickness of the cortical substance, is soft, of a greyish-white or pale red colour, darker when the venous plexus is congested, and easily detached from the cortical layer, being con-SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 661 nected with it only by the vessels and thin processes of areolar tissue sent inwards by the fibrous tunic. Moreover in the centre of the medullary substance is the trunk of a large vein, the vena supra-renalis. After death the medullary substance speedily runs into a state of decomposition, and is converted into a dirty brownish pulp. In intimate structure, the columns of the cortical substance are found to be composed of a series of round and oblong cavities in- vested and separated by areolar tissue. These cavities have been compared to the closed follicles of the follicular glands, and their contents are not unlike, namely, a granular substance with nuclei and cells, together with oil granules and pigment granules ; whether these contents are enclosed in a membrana propria is not yet deter- mined, and no vessels have been detected within them as occurs in the closed follicles of Peyer's glands. The medullary substance is composed of a fine network or stroma of areolar tissue, continuous with that of the corticah substance, and containing within its meshes a pale granular substance, and cells resembling nerve-cells, pale, with nucleus and nucleolus, fine granular contents, fat and pigment granules, and fine processes simple and branched. The peculiar structure of the supra-renal capsule has caused its two parts to be compared, the cortical substance to a blood-vascular, or ductless gland ;,the medullary substance to a sympathetic ganglion, bearing the same relation to the sympathetic system as the pituitary gland to the brain. In confirmation of this view is the great number of nerves which ramify through it, and the observation of Leydig, that in the salamander he had detected nerve fibres proceeding from its bipolar cells. The blood-vessels of the supra-renal capsules are very numerous. The arteries, about twenty in number, proceed from the aorta, phrenic, coeliac and renal trunks ; they enter the cortical substance at every point of its surface, the greater number dividing into minute twigs and forming a plexus in the cortical layer ; while others continue onwards to the medullary substance, and either ter- minate in the medullary plexus or cross the medullary substance to re-enter the cortical layer and contribute to the formation of its capillary plexus. In the cortical substance the capillaries are straight, occupy the intercolumnar spaces, and communicate with each other across the columns by transverse branches, forming oblong meshes; in the medullary substance the capillary plexus is a close network and the meshes rounded. The veins take their origin from the capillary plexus by minute venules, which unite to form the supra-renal vein. The supra-renal vein runs through the centre of the medullary substance, and issues from the supra- renal capsule at the hilum on its anterior surface, to terminate, on the right side in the inferior vena cava, on the left in the renal vein. Smaller veins take their course by the side of the arterial twigs, and leave the capsule at various points of its surface, and terminateTHE KIDNEYS. 662 in the renal and phrenic veins and inferior vena cava. The lym- phatic vessels are numerous, and belong to the exterior of the organ ; they terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are very numerous, and derived from the renal and phrenic plexus ; Kolliker counted as many as thirty-three trunks, composed of dark-bordered nerve-fibres and provided with isolated ganglia. They are distributed to the medullary substance only, in which they form a rich nervous plexus. THE KIDNEYS. The kidneys, the secreting organs of the urine, are situated in the lumbar regions, behind the peritoneum, and at each side of the vertebral column, extending from the eleventh rib to near the crest of the ilium, and approaching the vertebral column by their upper end. Each kidney is between four and five inches in length, about two inches and a half in breadth, somewhat more than one inch in thickness, and weighs between three and five ounces. The kidneys are usually surrounded by fat; they, rest on the crura of .the dia- phragm, on the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis muscle, which separates them from the quadratus lum- borum, and on the psoas maguus. The right kidney is somewhat lower than the left, from the position of the liver ; it is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the liver and descending portion of the duodenum, which rests against it ; and is covered in by the ascend- ing colon. The left kidney, higher than the right, is covered, in front, by the great end of the stomach, the spleen, and descend- ing colon. The anterior surface of the kidney is convex, the pos- terior is flat; the superior extremity is in relation with the supra- renal capsule ; the convex border is turned outwards towards the parietes of the abdomen ; the concave border looks inwards towards the vertebral column, and presents a deepnotch (hilum renale), which leads to a cavity, or sinus, within the organ. In the sinus renalis are situated the vessels and nerves of the kidney and the expansion of the excretory duct called pelvis renalis. At the hilum these vessels are so placed that the renal vein is in front of the artery, and the pelvis and ureter behind. The kidney is surrounded by a thick layer of fat, 'contained in the meshes of a loose areolar tissue, the adipose capsule; and immediately enclosed in a proper fibrous capsule, which is thin, firm, and whitish, and composed of dense areolar tissue intermingled with elastic fibres. The capsula propria is adherent by its inner surface to a thin layer, formed by the condensed areolar stroma of the organ, from which it may be easily torn. The substance of the kidney is dense and fragile, and when divided by a longitudinal incision, exhibits two structures, different in colour and texture,— an external vascxdar or cortical portion; and an internal tubular or medullary portion. The tubular portion consists of from eight663 THE KIDNEYS. to fifteen pale reddish coloured conical masses, having their apices or papilke directed towards the sinus renalis, and their bases to the cortical substance ; these conical masses are the pyramids of Mai- pighi, and are composed of an assemblage of straight tubuli, the " tubuli recti, which open on the surface of the papilla and divide into branches at acute angles as they proceed from the apex to the base of the pyramid ; moreover, the surface of the pyramid is marked by minute vascular streaks caused by the straight vessels of the tubular structure, the arte- rioles et vena'- recto?. The vascular or cortical portion, distinguished by its red colour and softer texture, forms the surface of the organ, surrounding the base of each pyra- mid and penetrating between them to the sinus renalis. It there- fore forms septa between the pyra- mids {septa vel columrue Bertini) and marks the original composition of the kidney of separate lobes. It is composed of blood-vessels, with the cortical fasciculi and ultimate teimriuations of the tubuli uriniferi, held together by a delicate stroma of areolar tissue. The tubuli uriniferi commence on the surface of the papillae by from two hundred to five hundred openings and take their course in straight lines, tubuli recti", through the pyramids, dividing dichoto- mously in their course and separated by thin long straight vessels, arteriolar et venoz rector. At the base of the pyramids of Malpighi the tubuli break up into numerousf small fasciculi, which enter the cortical substance, cortical fasciculi, and having a pyramidal form, have received the name of pyramids of Ferrein ; from the latter, the separate tubuli pass off on all sides, and especially at their extremity, and after a tortuous course (tubuli contorti) during * Section of the kidney, surmounted by the supra-renal capsule; the swell- ings on the surface mark the original constitution of the organ of lobes. 1.

Conse- quently fifteen pyramids would represent upwards of two millions of tubuli. Further, as there are 500 orifices upon each papilla, and the tubuli recti divide about ten times, it is probable that each tubulus rectus is the excretory duct of a separate cortical fasciculus.664 STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEYS. which they form plexuses and anastomoses with similar tubuli, ter- minate in small globular bodies, the corpora Malpighiana. The tubuli uriniferi vary somewhat in size in their Fig. 266.* course ; they are largest in the papillae, dimi- nish in size towards the base of the pyramid in consequence of giving off branches, and en- large in the pyramids of Ferrein and tubuli contorti, to become again constricted imme- diately before joining the corpora Malpighiana. The tubulus is cylindrical and composed of two layers, a thin homogeneous and elastic mem- brana propria, and an epithelium consisting of a single layer of polygonal nucleated cells. The epithelium is equal in thickness to two-thirds the diameter of the tubulus, the remaining third representing its area. The cells of the epithe- lium contain a finely granular substance occa- sionally intermingled with fatty and pigmentary granules ; and near the Malpighian body are furnished, according to Bowman, with vibratile cilia. The corpora Malpighiana are small globular bodies about of an inch in diameter, situated on the branches of small arteries, like fruit upon its stalk, in the vascular portion of the kidney immediately around the pyramids of Ferrein and in the septa renum. Each Malpighian cor- puscle consists of a capsule, the expanded ex- tremity of the uriniferous tubule, and contains in its interior a plexiform tuft of minute vessels, the glomerulus Malpighianus, embedded in epithelium ; the cells of the epithe- lium being smaller than those which line the tubule. The Mal- pighian corpuscle is therefore the origin of the uriniferous tubule, which is remarkable for its contorted course, first passing outwards and then suddenly bending inwards before joining with the cortical fasciculus ; and the glomerulus is the vascular source of the urinary secretion. The renal artery, derived from the aorta, divides into several large branches, which, entering the hilum, make their way into the vascular substance of the septa renum and thence to the peripheral * Plan of the structure of the kidney; after Kolliker. 1, 1.

From this rami- fication are given off small arteries which pass outwards between the cortical fasciculi, and have received the name of interlobulares ; and from the interlobular arteries the small afferent arteries pro- ceed, which enter the Malpighian bodies and constitute the glome- rulus. In the Malpighian body the afferent artery divides into from five to eight branches, and each of these branches into a bundle of capillaries, and the latter, re-uniting in the same manner, con- stitute the efferent vessel. The efferent vessel, quitting the Malpighian body by the side of the afferent artery, divides into capillary vessels, which form a rich capillary plexus throughout the whole of the cortical substance, and eventually terminate in the renal veins. Those efferent vessels which are nearest to the base of the pyramids take a straight course (arteriolar rectce) between the tubuli recti, and giving off but few branches in their course, also pass into a capillary plexus which surrounds the tubuli and terminates in the venulce rectce. Bowman, who regards the efferent vessels, not as arteries, but as veins, remarks that "there are in the kidney two perfectly distinct systems of capillary vessels, through both of which the blood passes in its course from the arteries into the veins ; the first, that" which forms the vascular tuft in the Malpighian bodies, and is "in immediate connexion with the arteries ; the second, that enve- loping the convolutions of the tubes, and communicating directly with the veins. The efferent ves- sels of the Malpighian bodies, that carry the blood between these two systems, may collectively be termed the portal system of the kidney." The inferences drawn by Bowman from his investigations are, that the capillary tufts of the Malpighian bodies are the part of the kidney specially acted on by diuretics; that they are the medium by which water, certain salts, and other sub- stances, pass out of the system ; that they are, moreover, the means of escape of certain morbid pro- ducts, suGh as sugar, albumen, and * Plan of the renal circulation; after Bowman, a.

' Respecting the capillary venous plexus, we have proof that the principal proximate constituents of urine, such as urea, lithic acid, &c, are, like the bile, derived from venous (portal) blood. The Veins of the kidney commence at the surface by minute con- verging venules, the stellated vessels, in the cortical substance where they form the interlobular veins, and in the pyramids of Malpighi, where they constitute the venulce rectce; proceeding from these three sources, they unite to form the branches of the renal vein, which terminates in the vena cava by a single large trunk at each side ; the' left renal vein receiving the left spermatic vein. Injec- tions thrown into the renal artery, and returning by the tubuli uriniferi, make their way into those tubes by rupture. The lym- phatic vessels accompany the deep blood-vessels, and terminate in the lumbar glands. The Nerves are derived from the renal plexus, which is formed partly by the solar plexus, and partly by the third splanchnic nerve. The renal plexus gives branches to the spermatic plexus, and branches which accompany the ureters: hence the morbid sympathies which exist between the kidney, ureter, and testicle : and by communications with the solar plexus, with the stomach and diaphragm, and indeed with the whole system. In the inti- mate structure'of the kidney, the nerve-fibres are, according to Toynbee, continuous with the nucleated cells of the parenchyma of the organ. The cavity of the Tcidney is occupied by a membranous bag, the pelvis renalis, which gives off three processes, the infundibula, one for each extremity, and one for the middle of the organ ; and the infundibula give off smaller processes termed calices, which embrace the papillse and form a separate pouch around each ; the calyx being firmly attached to the base of the papilla and con- tinuous with the fibrous capsule. Externally the sac of the pelvis renalis contracts into its excretory duct, the ureter. •The Ureter (odpov, urine ; rripetv, to keep) is a membranous tube, of about the diameter of a goose-quill, and nearly eighteen inches in length, continuous superiorly with the pelvis of the kidney, and constricted inferiorly, where it lies in an oblique direc- tion between the muscular and mucous coat of the base of the bladder, and opens on its mucous surface. Lying along the pos- terior wall of the abdomen, it is situated behind the peritoneum, and is crossed by the spermatic vessels ; in its course downwards it rests against the anterior surface of the psoas, and crosses the common iliac artery and vein, and then the external iliac vessels. Within the pelvis it crosses the hypogastric cord and vas deferens in the male ; and runs by the side of the cervix uteri and upper part of the vagina in the female. There are sometimes two ureters to one kidney. The ureter, the pelvis, the infundibula, and the calices are composed of three coats, external or fibrous, middle orVISCERA OF THE PELVIS, 667 muscular, and internal or mucous. The fibrous coat consists of condensed areolar tissue, intermingled with fine elastic fibres. The muscular coat is made up of muscular fibres of the smooth kind, disposed in two layers, external longitudinal, and internal circular ; while towards the bladder there are besides internal longitudinal fibres. The muscular coat is thick in the ureter and pelvis renalis, thia on the calices, and ceases altogether at the attachment of the latter to the papillae. The mucous coat is thin, vascular, and with- out villi ; on the papillae it is connected with the substance of the pyramids, and is continuous with the uriniferous tubuli, while infe- riorly it becomes blended with the mucous membrane of the bladder. The epithelium of the mucous coat is thick, and composed of several layers of nucleated cells, which are small aud round next the mem- brane ; of larger size and cylindrical or conical in the middle ; and large and spheroidal at the surface, sometimes measuring of an inch in breadth, and not unfrequently containing two nuclei. PELVIS. The 'cavity of the pelvis is that portion of the great abdominal cavity which is included within the bones of the pelvis, below the level of the linea-ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. It is bounded by the cavity of the abdomen above, and by the peri- neum below ; its internal parietes are formed, in front, below, and at the sides, by the peritoneum, pelvic fascia, levatores ani and obturator muscles ; and behind, by the coccygei muscles, sacro- ischiatic ligaments, pyriformes muscles, eacral plexus of nerves, sacrum and coccyx. The Viscera of the pelvis in the male are, the urinary bladder, prostate gland, vesiculoe seminales, and rectum. The Bladder is a hollow membranous viscus, triangular and flattened against the pubes when empty, ovoid when distended, situated behind the pubes and in front of and upon the rectum. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side ; and its long axis is directed from above, obliquely downwards and back- wards. It is divided into body, fundus, base, and neck. The body comprehends the middle zone of the organ ; the fundus, superior fundus, its upper segment; the base, inferior fundus, the lower broad extremity which rests on the rectum ; and the neck, the nar- row constricted portion which is applied against the prostate gland. It is retained in position by ligaments which are divisible into true and false ; the true ligaments are five in number, two ante- rior, two lateral, and the cord of the urachus ; the false ligaments are folds of the peritoneum, and are also five in number, two pos- terior, two lateral, and one superior. The anterior ligaments are formed by the recto-vesical fascia inYISCERA OF THE PELVIS. 668 its passage from the inner surface of the pubes at each side of the symphysis to the neck of the bladder and prostate gland. The lateral ligaments are also formed by the recto-vesical fascia in its passage from the levatores ani muscles to the sides of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder. The ligament of the urachus is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of a tubular canal (urachus) existing in the embryo. It proceeds from the summit of the bladder, and ascends along the linea alba to the umbilicus. The posterior false ligaments are the fold of peritoneum formed at each side of the pelvis by the obliterated hypogastric artery ; this fold also contains the ureter, and the vessels and nerves of the bladder. The lateral false ligaments are formed by the passage of the peritoneum from the side of the pelvis to the side of the bladder. The obliterated hypogastric artery lies along the line of reflection of the membrane. The superior or suspensory false ligament is the fold of peritoneum caused by the prominence of the cord of the urachus and the cords of the obliterated hypogastric arteries. The bladder is composed of four coats, external or serous, mus- cular, areolar, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, and derived from the peritoneum ; it invests the posterior surface and sides of the bladder, from about opposite the point of termination of the ureters to its summit, whence it is guided to the anterior wall of the abdomen by the hy- pogastric cords and urachus. The muscular coat consists of three layers, external or longitudinal, middle or circular, and internal, which is also longitudinal. The external layer, or detrusor urinos, consists of parallel longitudinal fasciculi which take their origin from the anterior ligaments of the bladder, thence named tendons of the detrusor urinfe ; they spread out upon the upper surface of the prostate gland (levator prostatse) and ascend upon the anterior sur- face of the bladder to the fundus, where they are inserted into the subserous tissue, some being continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the posterior surface of the organ, and others prolonged upon the urachus. The longitudinal fasciculi of the posterior surface and sides of the bladder, attached superiorly to the subserous tissue and partly continuous with those of the opposite aspect, while some are prolonged upon the urachus, are attached inferiorly to the prostate gland, those in the middle line being lost in the deep muscular layer of the neck of the bladder. The detrusor urinse is thickest on the anterior surface of the bladder ; it communicates by an inter- change of fasciculi with the middle layer, and in the female its pos- terior fibres are inserted into the vagina. The middle layer consists of circular fibres which are most numerous at the cervix, where they form a moderately thick stratum, the sphincter IURINARY BLADDER. 689 vesica?, and are then continued onwards around the prostatic urethra. The internal layer (submucous layer ; Ellis*), thinner than the preceding, is composed of fibres which are oblique and scattered in the fundus and body of the bladder, but become longitudinal in its lower part and base, and are continued through the cervix and along the urethra to its termination at the meatus urinarius.

The three muscular layers communicate with each other by means of a frequent interchange of fasciculi, and are thus enabled to act in unison as a single muscle. In the trigonum, the radiating fibres of the ureters have a transverse direction, and the muscular structure is intermingled with areolar and elastic tissue. The Areolar or submucous coat is the thick layer of areolar tissue interposed between the mucous and muscular coat, and forming the bond of union between them. The Mucous coat is thick and smooth, of a pale rose colour, and exactly moulded on the muscular coat, to which it is connected by the areolar coat; it has no papilla?, but numerous mucous glands which are most abundant in the cervix and fundus, and are either simple pyriform follicles or small aggregations of follicles constituting small racemose glands. The mucous membrane is continuous through the ureters with the lining membrane of the uriniferous ducts, and through the urethra with that of the seminiferous ducts, prostate gland and Cowper's glands. It is provided with a lami- nated epithelium, the deeper cells of which are conical or fusiform ; the superficial, spheroidal or flattened, and of unequal size. In the mucous glands the epithelium is columnar. The mucous mem- brane is rich in vessels, which are most abundant, as are the nerves, in the cervix and fundus ; the nerves are not numerous. On the internal surface of the base of the bladder is a triangular smooth plane, the trigonum vesicae or trigone vesicale (fig. 271), on which the mucous membrane is paler and thinner than the rest. Calculi resting on this part give rise to much suffering on account of the greater number of nerves distributed to the cervix vesicae. The trigonum is bounded at each side by the raised ridge, corresponding with the muscles of the ureters, at each posterior angle by the openings of the ureters, and, in front, by a slight elevation of the mucous membrane at the entrance of the urethra, called uvula vesicoz. The external surface of the base of the bladder corresponding with the trigonum is also triangular, and separated from the rectum bv a thin layer of areolo-fibrous membrane, derived from the recto- vesical fascia. It is bounded behind by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum; and at each side by the vas deferens and vesicula seminalis, which converge almost to a point at the base of the pro- state gland. It is through this space that the opening is made in the recto-vesical operation for puncture of the bladder. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the urinary bladder are the superior vesical, three or four small branches which proceed from the commencement of the hypogastric artery, previously to its671 PROSTATE GLAND. complete obliteration ; and inferior vesical, from the internal iliac. The latter is distributed to the base of the bladder, vesiculse semi- nales, and prostate gland. The veins are numerous and of large size, and form a plexus around the neck and at the base of the bladder ; the plexus communicates with the prostatic plexus and hemorrhoidal veins. The nerves of the bladder are derived from the inferior hypogastric plexuses and their communications with the third and fourth sacral nerves. PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland (irpoto-TTj/uu, preponere) is situated in front of the neck of the bladder, behind the triangular ligament and pelvic fascia, and upon the rectum, through which latter it may be felt with the finger. It surrounds the commencement of the urethra for a little more than an inch of its extent, and resembles a Spanish chesnut both in size and form ; the base being directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder, the apex forwards, and the convex side towards the rectum. It is retained firmly in position; by the anterior and lateral ligaments of the bladder, and by a process of the recto-vesical fascia, which forms a sheath around it. It consists of three lobes, two lateral and a middle lobe or isthmus ; the lateral lobes are distinguished by an indentation at the base of the gland, and a slight furrow on its upper and lower surface. The third lobe or isthmus is a small transverse band which passes between the two lateral lobes at the base of the organ. In structure the prostate is composed of smooth muscle and glandular tissue, the latter being not more than one-third or one-fourth of the whole, and consisting of from thirty to fifty com- pound racemose glands, of a pyriform shape. It is of a greyish-red colour and dense in texture, splits easily in the course of its ducts, and is surrounded by a proper fibrous covering, and by a plexus of veins enclosed in a sheath derived from the recto-vesical fascia. Its secretion is poured into the prostatic portion of the urethra by fifteen or twenty excretory ducts. The ducts of the lateral lobes open into the urethra at each side of the veru montanum ; those of the third lobe open upon and behind the veru. The urethra, in passing through the prostate, lies one-third nearer its upper, than its lower, surface. Ellis regards the prostate as "essentially a muscular body, consisting of circular or orbicular involuntary fibres, with one large central hole for the passage of the urethra," the circular fibres being continuous behind with those of the middle muscular layer of the bladder, and prolonged in front upon the membranous portion of the urethra as a stratum, -gV of an inch thick. This muscular layer he proposes to call orbicularis vel sphincter urethrce. The longitudinal fibres of the detrusor urinse continued forwards on theVESICULJ3 SEMINALES. 672 upper surface of the prostate, and attached to it laterally and behind, therefore represent the external muscular coat of the prostate, while the longitudinal fibres enclosing the urethra within the prostate constitute an internal muscular layer, corresponding and continuous with that of the bladder. The small secreting glands contained in the prostate are but an appendage of the mucous membrane projecting amongst the muscular fibres, and occupy but a small portion of the organ, chiefly at its base. The arteries of the prostate are small and derived from the in- ferior vesical and middle hEemorrhoidal; they distribute numerous capillaries to the glandular structure of the organ. The veins form a rich plexus in the submucous tissue of the urethra, and another of larger vessels on the exterior of the gland ; the latter receives from the front the veins of the penis, and terminates in the vesical plexus. VESICUL.E SEMINALES. On the under surface of the base of the bladder, and converging towards the base of the prostate gland, are two lobulated and some- what pyriform bodies, about two Fig. 269* inches in length, the vesiculaa semi- nales. Their upper surface is in contact with the base of the bladder; the under side rests on the rectum, separated only by a process derived from the recto-vesi- cal fascia; the larger extremities are directed backwards and out- wards, and the smaller ends almost meet at the base of the prostate. They enclose between them a tri- angular space, which is bounded posteriorly by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, and corresponds with the trigonum vesicas on the interior of the bladder. Each vesi- cula is formed by the convolutions of a single tube, which gives off several irregular csecal sacculi and branches. It is enclosed in a thin * Posterior aspect of the male bladder; the serous covering is removed in order to show the muscular coat. 1. Body of the Madder. 2. Fundus. 3. In- ferior fundus or base. 4.

The vas deferens, somewhat enlarged and sacculated, lies along the inner border of each vesicula, and is included in its fibrous investment. It com- municates with the duct of the vesicula beneath the isthmus of the prostate, and forms the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and running forwards, first between the base of the prostate and the isthmus, and then through the tissue of the veru montanum, opens on the mucous membrane of the urethra, by the side of or within the aperture of the sinus pocularis. The vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia are partly covered in by a muscular layer, compressor vesicular et ductus seminalis (Ellis) ; which is brought into view on raising the recto-vesical fascia. This muscular layer consists of transverse and longitudinal fibres, the transverse fibres being the most superficial, and con- tinuous with the posterior border of the prostate gland ; the longi- tudinal fibres lying in contact with the vesiculse and vasa deferentia. The longitudinal fibres form a continuous fleshy plane for the space of half; an inch behind the prostate, and are prolonged for a short distance backwards on the vesiculse and vasa deferentia, lying chiefly along their borders ; while, anteriorly, the fibres accompany the ejaculatory ducts to the termination of the latter in the urethra, and are continuous with the internal longitudinal coat of the prostatic urethra. "This muscular layer will compress and shorten the vesiculse seminales, and the lower dilated ends of the vasa defe- rentia ;" and most forcibly when the bladder is distended. In structure the vesiculse seminales are composed of three coats : external, a thin fibrous membrane, made up of condensed areolar tissue; middle, a muscular coat, consisting of smooth muscular fibres arranged in two layers, longitudinal and circular ; and inter- nal, a thin mucous membrane, vascular, marked by a delicate reticulation of ridges and alveoli, and coated with a squamous epi- thelium of cells containing yellowish pigment granules. The vesi- culse are covered externally and their convolutions held together by a thin membrane of areolar tissue, and they are further invested by the recto-vesical fascia, and the muscular stratum already described, MALE ORGANS OP GENERATION. The organs of generation in the male are, the penis and testes, with their appendages. PENIS. The Penis is divisible into a body, root, and extremity. The body is surrounded by a thin integument, which is remarkable for the looseness of its connexion with the deeper parts of the organ, and for containing no adipose tissue. The root is broad, and firmly x xCORPUS CAVERNOSUM- PENIS. 674 adherent to the rami of the puhes and ischium by means of two strong processes, the crura, and connected to the symphysis pubis by an elastic fibrous membrane, the ligamentum suspensorium. The extremity or glans penis resembles an obtuse cone, somewhat com- pressed from above downwards, and of a deeper red colour than the surrounding skin. At its apex is a small vertical slit, the meatus urinarius, which is bounded by two, more or less protuberant, labia; and, extending backwards from the meatus, a grooved raphe, to which a loose fold of mucous membrane, the frcenum prcepittii, is attached. The base of the glans is marked by a pro- jecting collar, the corona glandis, upon which are seen a number of small papillary elevations, the glandules odoriferce Tysoni. Behind the corona is a deep fossa, fossa glandis (cervix), bounded by a circular fold of integument, prceputium, which, in the collapsed state of the organ, may be drawn over the glans, but, in its dis- tended state, is obliterated, and serves to facilitate its enlargement. The internal surface of the prepuce is lined by mucous membrane, covered by a tbin epithelium; this membrane, on reaching the cervix glandis, is reflected over the glans, and, at the meatus urinarius, is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. The superficial fascia of the penis is thin, and its areolar struc- ture free from fat; it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen above, and with the dartos and superficial fascia of the perineum below. The ligamentum suspensorium penis is an elastic fibrous mem- brane of triangular form, attached by its apex to the symphysis pubis ; and by its base, to the body of the penis. Near the latter attachment it separates into two layers, to give passage to the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis. The penis is composed of the corpus cavernosum and corpus spon- giosum, and contains in its interior the longest portion of the urethra. u The Corpus cavernosum is distinguished into two lateral portions (corpora cavernosa) by an imperfect septum and a superior and in- ferior groove, and is divided posteriorly into two crura. It is firmly adherent, by means of its crura, to the rami of the pubes and ischium ; and each crus, previously to its junction with its fellow, presents a slight enlargement, which was named by Kobelt, the bulb. The corpus cavernosum forms, anteriorly, a single rounded extremity, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans ; the superior groove lodges the dorsal vessels of the penis, and the inferior receives the corpus spongiosum. Its fibrous tunic is thick, elastic, and extremely firm, and sends a number of fibrous bands and cords (trabecule) inwards from the inferior groove, which cross the interior in a radiating direction, and are inserted into the inner walls of the tunic. These trabecule are most abundant at the middle line, where they are ranged vertically, side by side, some- what like the teeth of a comb, and constitute the imperfect parti- tion of the corpus cavernosum, called septum pectiniforme. The675 CORPUS SPONGIOSUM PENIS. septum is more complete at its posterior than towards its anterior part. The tunic of the corpus cavernosum consists of two layers of fibrous fasciculi, the external being longitudinal and forming a kind of close net by the frequent interchange of their fibrous bundles ; the internal, less thick, being disposed in a circular direction, and constituting the septum pectiniforme. From its anterior extremity it gives off small fibrous bands, which are prolonged into the sub- stance of the glans penis.* The cavity of the corpus cavernosum is occupied by the spongy mass of its erectile tissue. The Corpus spongiosum is situated along the under surface of the corpus cavernosum, in its inferior groove. It commences by its posterior extrerhity between and beneath the crura penis, where it forms an enlargement, the bulb, and terminates anteriorly by another expansion, the glans penis. Its middle portion, or body, is nearly cylindrical, and tapers gradually from the posterior to the anterior extremity. The bulb is adherent to the triangular liga- ment by means of a prolongation of fibrous membrane ; in the rest of its extent the corpus spongiosum is attached to the corpus caver- nosum, by areolar tissue, and by veins which pass upwards to reach the dorsal vein. It is composed of erectile tissue, enclosed in a dense fibrous layer much thinner than that of the corpus cavernosum, and contains the spongy portion of the urethra, which lies nearer its upper than its lower wall. ' The bulb shows a tendency to divi- sion into two lobes, an appearance which is due to the existence of a thin longitudinal septum in its interior. The fibrous tunic of the corpus spongiosum, unlike that of the corpus cavernosum, consists only of circular fibres which are re- flected inwards along the middle line, forming a septum which is complete only in the bulb ; the reflected fibres of this septum em- brace the urethra through its entire length, and exclude the latter from the proper structure of the corpus spongiosum. Erectile tissue is a peculiar cellulo-vascular structure, entering in considerable quantity into the composition of the organs of genera- tion. It consists essentially of a plexus of veins so closely convoluted and interwoven, as to give rise to a cellular appearance when examined by means of a section. The veins forming this plexus are smaller in the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and circum- ference of the corpus cavernosum, than in the central part of the latter, where they are large and dilated. They have no other coat than the internal lining prolonged from the neighbouring veins ; and the interstices of the plexus are occupied by a reddish smooth muscular tissue. The arteries are convoluted in the passive state of the penis, but straightened in its distended condition; they terminate in large capillaries, which do not form a plexus, as in other situations, but open directly into these dilated veins. Some * Ellis: loc. citat. x x 2676 URETHRA. of the finer twigs of the arteries have a peculiar, twisted, and dilated or tendril-like appearance, first described by Muller under the name of arterice helicince. The helicine arteries were supposed by Muller to end by csecal terminations ; but Kolliker finds a minute artery to proceed from the bulbous extremity of each of these dilated vessels, and terminate like the other capillaries in the veins. Arnold regards the helicine arteries as mere vascular loops. The venous plexus conveys the blood into the efferent veins of the penis, by which it is returned to the general circulation. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the penis are derived from the internal pudic; they are, the arteries of the bulb, arteries of the corpus cavernosum, and dorsales penis. Its veins are superficial and deep. The deep veins run by the side of the deep arteries, and terminate in the internal pudic veins. The superficial veins escape in considerable number from the base of the glans, and converge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which receives other veins from the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the ligamentum suspen- sorium, and through the triangular ligament beneath the arch of the pubes, to terminate in the prostatic plexus. The Lymphatics terminate in the upper group of inguinal glands, while some of the deeper lymphatics take the course of the urethra and end in the pelvic glands. The nerves are derived from the pudic nerve, sacral plexus, and hypogastric plexus. URETHRA. The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It is curved in its course, and composed of three layers, a mucous coat, submucous coat, and muscular coat. The mucous coat is thin and smooth ; it is con- tinuous internally, with the mucous membrane of the bladder; externally, with the investing membrane of the glans; and at certain points of its extent, with the lining membrane of the numerous ducts which open into the urethra, namely, those of Cowper's glands, prostate gland, vasa deferentia, and vesiculae seminales. It is provided with a squamous epithelium correspond- ing with that of the bladder. The submucous coat is loose, and contains numerous racemose mucous glands, which open on the surface of the mucous membrane. The muscular coat consists of longitudinal fibres, intermingled with areolar and elastic tissue, and is derived from the internal muscular layer of the bladder. The urethra is about eight inches in length, and divided into a prostatic, membranous, and spongy portion.- The Prostatic portion, a little more than an inch in length, is situated in the prostate gland, about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface, and extending from its base to its apex. On its lower circumference or floor is a longitudinal ridge or crest,677 URETHRA. the veru montanum, or caput gallinaginis, formed by a fasciculus of the longitudinal muscular fibres of the urethra ; and at each side of the veru, a shallow fossa, the prostatic sinus, in which are seen the numerous openings (15 to 20) of the prostatic ducts.

This sac is the analogue of the uterus ; it is nearly half an inch in length, ex- tends back beneath the third lobe of the prostate, and by its approach to the surface contributes to the prominence of the veru montanum. Its walls, of a yellowish-white colour, are composed of areolar and elastic tissue, mingled towards its fundus with smooth muscular fibre, and it is lined within by a columnar epithelium. The ejacu- latory ducts, enveloped in longitudinal smooth muscular fibre, take their course forward by the side of the sinus pocularis, and terminate within its aperture by slit-like openings. The prostatic portion of the urethra, when distended, is the most dilated part of the canal ; but, excepting during the passage of urine, is completely closed by its muscular tissue. In the contracted I state of the urethra, the veru montanum acts as a valve, being pressed upwards against its roof; but, during the action of the detrusor muscle of the bladder, the canal is dilated. The Membranous portion, the narrowest part of the canal, mea- sures about three lines in dia- meter, and is somewhat less than an inch in length. It extends from the apex of the prostate gland to the bulb of the corpus spongiosum, and passes through the triangular ligament. Its coats are, the mucous membrane, longitudinal muscular coat, and compressor urethral muscle. The submucous tissue is richly supplied with vessels. The spongy portion, about six inches in length, forms the rest of the extent of the canal, and is lodged in the corpus spongiosum from its commencement at the * The bulbous, membranous, and prostatic urethra, with part of the bladder. 1.

It is narrowest in the body, and dilated at each extremity, posteriorly in the bulb, where it is named the bulbous portion, and anteriorly in the glans penis, where it forms the fossa navicularis. The meatus urinarius is the most constricted part of the canal; so that a catheter, which will enter that opening, may be passed freely through the whole extent of a normal urethra. Opening into the bulbous portion are two small excretory ducts about an inch in length, which may be traced backwards, between the coats of the urethra and the bulb, to the under part of the membranous por- tion behind the triangular ligament, where they originate in two small, lobulated, and somewhat compressed glands, of about the size of peas, Cowper^s glands. These glands are enclosed in a thin membrana propria, their glandular structure being held together by areolar tissue and smooth muscular fibre ; smooth muscular fibre is also found as a longitudinal layer, around their excretory ducts. Their glandular vesicles are lined by a tesselated epithelium, the epithelium of the excretory ducts being of the columnar kind. They are situated immediately beneath the membranous portion of the urethra, and are enclosed by the lower segment of the compressor uretkrb muscle, so as to be subject to muscular compression. On the whole internal surface of the spongy portion of the urethra, and especially along its lower surface, are numerous small openings of lacunee, the apertures of mucous glands situated in the submucous areolar tissue. The openings of the lacuna? are directed forwards, and are liable occasionally to intercept the point of a small catheter in its passage to the bladder. At about an inch and a half from the opening of the meatus, in the upper wall of the urethra, one of the lacuna? is generally found much larger than the rest, and is named the lacuna magna. In a preparation of this lacuna, made by Sir Astley Cooper, the extremity of the canal presents several large primary ramifications. TESTES. The testes are two small glandular organs suspended from the abdomen by the spermatic cords, and enclosed in an external tegu- mentary covering, the scrotum. The Scrotum is distinguished into two lateral halves or hemi- spheres by a raphe, which is continued anteriorly along the under surface of the penis, and posteriorly along the middle line of the perineum to the anus. Of these two lateral portions the left is somewhat longer than the right, and corresponds with the greater length of the spermatic cord on the left side. The scrotum is composed of two layers, integument, and a proper covering, the dartos ; the integument is thin, devoid of fat, semi- transparent, possesses numerous large sebiparous and sudoriparous glands, is beset with hairs which issue obliquely from the skin,SPERMATIC COED. 680 and have prominent roots, and has usually a dark colour from the presence of pigment in the epidermis. The tunica dartos is a thin reddish layer composed of smooth muscular tissue; it forms the proper tunic of the scrotum, and sends inwards a septum, septum scroti, which divides the cavity into two sacs for the two testes. The dartos is continuous around the base of the scrotum with the common superficial fascia of the abdomen and perineum, and in an attenuated form is prolonged upon the penis to the prepuce. The Spermatic cord is the medium of communication between the testes and the interior of the abdomen; and is composed of arteries, veins, lymphatics, nerves, the excretory duct of the testicle, and investing tunics. It commences at the internal abdominal ring, where the vessels of which it is composed converge, and passes obliquely along the spermatic canal: the cord then escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends through the scrotum to the posterior border of the testicle. The left cord is somewhat longer than the right, and permits the left testicle to reach a lower level than its fellow. The Arteries of the spermatic cord are, the spermatic artery from the aorta ; the deferential artery, accompanying the vas deferens, from the superior vesical; and the cremasteric, from the epigastric artery. The spermatic veins form a plexus, which constitutes the chief bulk of the cord ; they are provided with valves at short in- tervals, and the smaller veins have a peculiar tendril-like arrange- ment, which has obtained for them the name of vasa pampini- formia. The lymphatics are of large size, and terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus, which is derived from the aortic and renal plexus, the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the scrotal branch of the ilio-inguinal. The Vas deferens, the excretory duct of the testicle, is situated along the posterior border of the cord, where it may be distin- guished by the hard and cordy sensation which it communicates to the fingers. It is about a line or a line and a half in thickness ; its parietes are thick and tougb, and its canal from one-fourth to one-third the diameter of the entire duct. In structure it is com- posed of three coats, an external or fibrous coat, which is thin ; a middle or muscular coal, which is remarkable for its thickness, and consists of three layers of smooth muscular fibre, namely, external longitudinal, middle circular, and internal longitudinal ; and an internal or mucous coat, the mucous membrane being pale in colour, disposed in longitudinal plaits, and coated with a squamous epithelium, composed of cells containing yellowish pig- ment granules. In the dilated portion, near its extremity, it presents a reticular appearance, like that of the vesiculse seminales. The Coverings of the spermatic cord are, the spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle, and fascia propria. The spermatic fascia is a prolongation of the intercolumnar fascia, derived from the borders of the external abdominal ring during the descent of the testicle681 ANATOMY OF THE TESTIS. in the foetus. The cremasteric covering, erythroid, is the thin muscular expansion formed by the spreading out of the fibres of the cremaster, which is likewise carried down by the testis during its descent. The fascia propria is a continuation of the infundi- buliform process from the transversalis fascia, which immediately invests the vessels of the cord, and is also obtained during the descent of the testis. The Testis (testicle) is a small oblong and rounded gland, about an inch and a half in length, somewhat compressed at the sides and behind, and suspended in the cavity of the scrotum by the spermatic cord. Its position in the scrotum is oblique, so that the upper ex- tremity is directed upwards and forwards, and a little outwards ; the lower, downwards and backwards, and a little inwards ; the convex border looks forwards and downwards, and the flattened border, to which the cord is attached, backwards and upwards. Lying against its outer and posterior border is a flattened body which follows the course of the testicle, and extends from its upper to its lower extremity; this body is named, from its relation to the testis, epididymis (eirl, upon, SLdv- fjios, the testicle) ; it is divided into a central part or body, an upper extremity or globus major, and a lower extremity, globus minor (cau- da) epididymis. The globus major is situated against the upper end of the testicle, to which it is closely adherent; the'globus minor is placed at its lower end, is attached to the testis by areolar tissue, and curves upwards, to become continuous with the vas deferens. The testis is in- vested by three tunics, tunica vagi- nalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa, and is connected to the inner surface of the dartos by a large quantity of extremely loose * Transverse section of the testicle. 1.

The tunica vaginalis is a pouch of serous membrane derived from the peritoneum in the descent of the testis, and afterwards obliterated from the abdomen to within a short distance of the gland. Like other serous coverings, it is a shut sac, investing the organ, visceral portion, and then reflected so as to form a bag around its circumference, parietal portion. The visceral portion, tunica vaginalis propria, covers the surface of the tunica albuginea, and surrounds the epididymis, connecting it to the testis by means of a duplicature. The parietal portion, tunica vaginalis communis, is attached by its external surface, through the medium of a quantity of loose areolar tissue, to the inner surface of the dartos. Between the two layers is the smooth surface of the shut sac, moistened by its proper secretion. The Tunica albuginea (dura mater testis) is a thick areolo- fibrous membrane, of a bluish-white colour, andtbe proper tunic of the tes'ticle. It is adherent externally to the tunica vaginalis pro- pria, and, from the union of a serous with a fibrous membrane, is regarded as a fibro-serous membrane, like the dura mater and peri- cardium. After surrounding the testicle, the tunica albuginea is reflected from its posterior border into the interior of the gland, and forms a projecting longitudinal ridge, the mediastinum testis (corpus Eighmorianum*), from which numerous fibrous cords (tra- beculae, septula) are given off, to be inserted into the inner surface of the tunic. The mediastinum serves to contain the vessels and ducts of the testicle in their passage into the substance of the organ, and the fibrous cords are adapted to prevent compression of the gland. If a transverse section of the testis be made, and the surface of the mediastinum examined, it will be observed that the blood-vessels of the substance of the organ are situated near the posterior border of the mediastinum, while the divided ducts of the rete testis occupy a place nearer the free margin. The Tunica vasculosa (pia mater testis) is the nutrient mem- brane of the testis ; it is situated immediately within the tunica albuginea, and encloses the substance of the gland, sending pro- cesses inwards between the lobules, in the same manner that the pia mater is reflected between the convolutions of the brain. The substance of the testis consists of numerous conical flattened lobules (lobuli testis), the bases being directed towards the surface of the organ, and the apices towards the mediastinum. Krause found between four and five hundred of these lobules in a single testis. Each lobule is invested by a distinct sheath formed of two layers, one being derived from the tunica vasculosa, the other from * jSTathaniel Highmore, a physician of Oxford, in his " Corporis Humani Disquisitio Anatomiea," published in 1651, considers the corpus Highmoria- num as a duct formed by the convergence of the fibrous cords, which he mis- takes for smaller ducts.EPIDIDYMIS. 683 Fig. 273.t the tunica albuginea. The lobule is composed of from one to three minute tubnli, tuhuli seminiferi,* exceedingly convoluted, anas- tomosing frequently with each other near their extremities, termi- nating in loops or in free ctecal ends, and of the same diameter j-^-g- of an inch, Lauth) throughout. The tubuli seminiferi are of a bright yellow colour ; they become less convoluted in the apices of the lobules, and terminate by forming between twenty and thirty small straight ducts of about twice the diameter of the tubuli semi- niferi, the vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the substance of the mediastinum, and terminate in from seven to thirteen ducts, smaller in diameter than the vasa recta. These ducts pursue a waving course from below upwards through the fibrous tissue of the medi- astinum ; they communicate freely with each other, and constitute the rete testis. At the upper extremity of the mediastinum, the ducts of the rete testis terminate in from nine to thirty small ducts, the vasa efferentia,% which form by their convolutions a series of conical masses, the coni vasculosi ; from • the bases of these cones tubes of larger size probeed, which constitute, by their complex convolutions, the body of the epididymis. The tubes become gradually larger towards the lower end of the epididymis, and terminate in a single large and convoluted duct, the vas de- ferens. The Epididymis is formed by the convolutions of the excretory seminal ducts, externally to the testis, and pre- viously to their termination in the vas deferens. The more numerous convo- lutions and the aggregation of the coni vasculosi at the upper end of the organ constitute the globus major; the conti- nuation of the convolutions downwards is the tody; and the smaller number of convolutions of the single tube at * Lauth estimates the whole number of tubuli seminiferi in each testis at 840, and their average length at 2 feet 3 inches.

The tubuli are connected together "by filamentous areolar" tissue, and are enclosed by the tunica vaginalis. A small convoluted duct, of variable length, is generally con- nected with the duct of the epididymis, just at the commencement of the vas deferens. This is the vasculum aberrans of Haller ; it is attached to the epididymis by the areolar tissue in which that body is enveloped. Sometimes it becomes dilated towards its ex- tremity, but more frequently retains the same diameter throughout. The Vas deferens maybe traced upwards, from the globus minor of the epididymis along the posterior part of the spermatic cord, and along the spermatic canal to the internal abdominal ring. From the ring it is reflected inwards to the side of the fundus of the bladder, and descends along its posterior surface, crossing the direc- tion of the ureter, to the inner border of the vesicula seminalis. In. the latter situation it becomes somewhat larger in size and saccu- lated, and terminates at the base of the prostate gland, by uniting with the duct of the vesicula seminalis, and constituting the ejacu- latory duct. The ejaculatory duct, which is thus formed by the junction of the duct of the vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens, passes forwards in the outer wall of the sinus pocularis, and termi- nates by a slit-like opening close to or just within the aperture of the sinus. FEMALE PELVIS. The peculiarities in form of the female pelvis have already been examined with the anatomy of the bones (p. 101). Its lining boun- daries are the same as those of the male. The contents are the bladder, vagina, uterus with its appendages, and rectum. Some portion of the small intestine also occupies the upper part of its cavity. The Bladder is in relation with the pubes in front, with the uterus behind, from which it is usually separated by a convolution of small intestine, and with the neck of the uterus and vagina be- neath. The form of the female bladder corresponds with that of the pelvis, being broad from side to side, and often bulging more on one side than on the other. This is particularly evident after parturition. The coats of the bladder are the same as those of the male. The Urethra, about an inch and a half in length, is lodged in the upper and anterior wall of the vagina, in its course downwards and forwards, beneath the arch of the pubes, to the meatus urinarius. It is composed of three coats, mucous, submucous, and muscular; the mucous coat is vascular, and disposed in longitudinal folds, and is continuous internally with the mucous membrane of the bladder and externally with that of the vulva. It is provided with a squa- mous epithelium, having a deep stratum of elongated cells, like the685 FEMALE PELVIS. mucous membrane of tbe bladder, and near its extremity has, open- ing on its surface, tbe ducts of numerous racemose mucous glands, tbe glands of Littre. The submucous coat is loose, and provided with a considerable plexus of veins, and in its areolar tissue are situated the racemose mucous glands, which open into the urethra near its termination.

The female urethra is remarkable for its distensibility, which is only restricted at the meatus by a ring of dense areolar tissue ; hence, in distending the urethra for surgical purposes, it is often necessary to divide the margin of the meatus with the knife. VAGINA. The Vagina is a membranous canal, leading from the vulva to the uterus, and corresponding in direction with the axis of the outlet of the pelvis. It is constricted at its commencement, but near the uterus becomes dilated, and is closed by the contact of the anterior with the posterior wall. Its length is variable ; but it is always longer on the posterior than on the anterior wall, the former being usually about five or six inches in length, the latter about four. It is attached to the cervix of the uterus, which latter projects into the upper extremity of the canal. Its upper fourth is covered pos- teriorly by the peritoneum, while anteriorly the peritoneum is re- flected from the cervix uteri without reaching so low as the vagina ; it is firmly connected to the bladder in front, and loosely to the rectum behind ; while at the sides it receives the attachment of the posterior layer of the broad ligaments above, and that of the pelvic fascia and levatores ani below. Its close connexion with the bladder occasions the prolapsus of that organ in cases of prolapsus uteri, while its looser connexion with the rectum preserves the latter from a similar accident. The vagina, about one line in thickness, is composed of three coats, external, fibrous; middle, muscular ; and internal, mucous. The external, or fibrous coat, is thin and white, and consists of con- densed areolar tissue, with an admixture of elastic fibres. It is firm around the upper part of the tube, and lax inferiorly, and contains in its tissue, especially below, an abundant venous plexus. By its inner surface it is blended with the muscular coat without any dis- tinct separation. The middle, or muscular coat, is composed of smooth muscular fibre, arranged in longitudinal and circular bundles, and intermingled with areolar tissue and a considerable plexus of veins. The internal, or mucous coat, is of a pale red colour, and disposed in numerous plaits or folds, columnar "rugosw ; which diverge transversely from a middle line, or raphe, situated on the anterior and posterior wall of the vagina ; the rugee are most strongly developed on the anterior wall, and the median raphe are termed columns of the vagina. In intimate structure the mucous membrane consists of areolar and elastic tissue, to which its firm- ness and elasticity are due, and presents numerous conical papillse embedded in a squamous epithelium. The epithelium is thick and laminated, resembling that of the oesophagus, its upper scales measuring about T-jnrF of an inch in diameter ; it is continuous ex-UTERUS. 687 terna'lly with the epithelium of the vulva, and terminates internally at about the middle of the cervix uteri. UTERUS. The Uterus is a flattened organ of a pyriform shape, having the base directed upwards and forwards, and the apex downwards and backwards, in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis, and forming a considerable angle with the course of the vagina. It is convex on its posterior surface, and somewhat flattened in front; in the unimpregnated state it is about three inches in length, two in breadth across its broadest part, and one in thickness ; and is divisible into fundus, body, cervix, and os uteri. At the period of puberty the uterus weighs about one ounce and a half; after partu- rition from two to three ounces; and at the ninth month of utero- gestation from two to four pounds. The Fundus and body are enclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, which is connected with the sides of the pelvis, and forms a trans- verse septum between the bladder and rectum. The folds formed by this duplicature of peritoneum at either side of the organ are the broad ligaments. The cervix is the lowest portion of the uterus; * Uterus with its appendages viewed from the front. 1. Body of the uterus. 2. Fundus. 3. Cervix. 4. Os uteri. 5.

The open- ing of the os uteri is of considerable size, and is named the orijjicium uteri externum; the canal then becomes narrowed, and at the upper end of the cervix is constricted into a smaller opening, the orificium internnm* Beyond this point the canal of the cervix expands into the shallow triangular cavity of the uterus, the inferior angle cor- responding with the orificium internum, and the two superior angles, which are funnel-shaped and represent the original bicornute con- dition of the organ, with the commencement of the Fallopian tubes. The uterus is composed of three tunics : of an external or serous coat, derived from the peritoneum, which constitutes the duplica- tures at each side of the organ called the broad ligaments ; of a middle or muscular coat, which gives thickness and bulk to the uterus; and of an internal or mucous membrane, which lines its interior, and is continuous on the one hand with the mucous lining of the Fallopian tubes, and on the other with that of the vagina. In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly dense in texture, offers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish, fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uterus the fibres are of large size, distinct, and separable into three layers : external, which are longitudinal and transverse, the former constituting a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surface and fundus of the organ, the latter being prolonged outwards on the Fallopian tubes, and into the round and ovarian ligaments; middle, a thick layer consisting of flat bundles of transverse, longitudinal, and oblique fibres, com- plexly interlaced, and traversed by a plexus of large veins, which give this portion of the substance of the uterus a spongy appearance ; and an internal layer of longitudinal, transverse, and oblique fibres. The longitudinal fibres of the internal or deep layer are thin and slender, the transverse stronger and continued as an annular stratum upon the Fallopian tubes, while around the os uteri they form a circular ring, the sphincter uteri. The formative elements of the muscular coat are short, fusiform fibre cells, about of an inch long, with long oval nuclei, intermingled with a considerable quantity of immature nucleated areolar tissue. The mucous membrane, of a whitish or pale red colour, is closely connected, or more correctly, is blended with the muscular coat; it is composed of immature nucleated areolar tissue without elastic fibres, is smooth on the surface, and coated by a ciliated epithelium, * The orificium internum is not unfrequently obliterated in old persons. Indeed, this obliteration is so common, as to have induced M ayer to regard it as normal.689 VESSELS AND NERVES OP THE UTERUS. the direction of the vibrations of the cilia being from without in- wards. In the cervix uteri the mucous membrane is somewhat thicker than in the fundus, and on the anterior and posterior surface of its canal is disposed in folds, plica palmatce, which have received the name of arbor vitce uterina. In the lower part of the cervix, moreover, are found filiform papillse, invested by a ciliated epithelium. The mucous glands of the uterus, or uterine glands, are minute follicles corresponding in length with the thickness of the mucous membrane, very numerous, sometimes simple, sometimes bifid, and sometimes spirally twisted. Their structure resembles other mucous glands, namely, a membrana propria, an epithelium of spheroidal cells in the fundus of the follicle, and of columnar cells in the excretory duct. They become much enlarged during preg- nancy. In the cervix uteri, between the plicae palmatse, are found other mucous follicles which secrete the peculiar, transparent, vitreous or crystalline mucus of that region. It is these follicles in an imperforate state which constitute the small transparent vesicles termed ovula Nabothi, seen in the canal of the cervix, around'the os uteri, and sometimes in its cavity. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the uterus are, the uterine from the internal iliac, and the ovarian from the aorta; they ramify through the muscular and mucous coat, forming a plexus of larger vessels in the deep portion of the latter, and of smaller vessels in its superficial portion ; from the smaller vessels are given off the capillaries, which constitute a fine plexus around the glands and a coarse plexus at the surface, the blood from the latter passing into the veins. The veins take the course of the arteries, and terminate in the venous plexus situated on each side of the body of the uterus. In the impregnated womb, the veins are so much dilated as to deserve the name of sinuses ; they are thin in structure, and devoid of valves, and their great number in the muscular coat gives a spongy appearance to the walls of the pregnant uterus. The lymphatics are numerous, the deep commencing in the mucous membrane, the superficial taking their course in the subserous tissue ; they follow the direction of the blood-vessels, and terminate in the pelvic and lumbar glands. The Nerves of the uterus are derived from the hypogastric and spermatic plexuses, and from the sacral plexus. They have been made the subject of special investigation by Dr. Robert Lee, who has successfully repaired the omission made by Dr. William Hunter, in this part of the anatomy of the organ. In his numerous dissec- tions of the uterus, both in the unimpregnated and gravid state, Dr. Lee has made the discovery of several large nervous ganglia and plexuses. The principal of these, situated at each side of the cervix uteri immediately behind the ureter, he terms the hypogastric gan- glion; it receives the greater number of the nerves from the hypo- gastric and sacral plexuses, and distributes branches to the uterus,690 FALLOPIAN TUBES. vagina, bladder, and rectum. Of the branches to the uterus, a large fasciculus proceeds upwards by the side of the organ towards its angle, where they communicate with branches of the spermatic plexus, and form another large ganglion, which he designates the spermatic ganglion, and which supplies the fundus uteri. Besides these, Dr. Lee describes vesical and vaginal ganglia, and anterior and posterior subperitoneal ganglia and plexuses, which communicate with the preceding, and constitute an extensive nervous network over the entire uterus. Dr. Lee concludes his observations by remarking :— 4' These dissections prove that the human uterus possesses a great system of nerves, which enlarges with the coats, blood-vessels, and absorbents, during pregnancy, and which returns after parturition to its original condition before conception takes place. It is chiefly by the influence of these nerves that the uterus performs the varied functions of menstruation, conception, and parturition, and it is solely by their means that the whole fabric of the nervous system sympathises with the different morbid affections of the uterus. If these nerves of the uterus could not be demonstrated, its physi- ology and pathology would be completely inexplicable."* APPENDAGES OP THE TJTEKITS. The Appendages of the uterus are enclosed by the lateral dupli- catures of peritoneum, called the broad ligaments. They are the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. The FALLOPiANf tubes or oviducts, the uterine trumpets of the French writers, are situated in the upper border of the broad liga- ments, and are connected with the superior angles of the uterus. They are somewhat trumpet-shaped, being smaller at the uterine than at the free extremity, and narrower in the middle than at either end. Each tube is about four or five inches in length, and more or less flexuous in its course. The canal of the Fallopian tube is exceedingly minute ; its inner extremity opens by means of the ostium uterinum into the upper angle of the cavity of the uterus, and the opposite end into the cavity of the peritoneum. The free or expanded extremity of the Fallopian tube presents a double and sometimes a triple series of small processes or fringes, which surround the margin of the trumpet or funnel-shaped opening, the ostium abclominale. This fringe-like appendage to the end of the tube has gained for it the appellation of the fimbriated extre- mity ; and the remarkable manner in which this circular fringe applies itself to the surface of the ovary during sexual excitement, the additional title of morsus diaboli. A short ligamentous cord * Philosophical Transactions for 1842. t Gabriel Fallopius, a nobleman of Modena, was one of the founders of modern anatomy. He was Professor at Ferrara, then at Pisa, and afterwards succeeded Vesalius at Padua. His principal observations are collected in a work, " Observationes Anatomicse," which he published in 1561.OYAEIES. 691 proceeds from the fimbriated extremity to be attached to the distal end of the ovary, and serves to guide the tube in its seizure of that organ. The Fallopian tube is composed of three tunics, an external and serous investment derived from the peritoneum ; a middle or mus- cular coat, consisting of circular (internal) and longitudinal (exter- nal) fibres, continuous with those of the uterus; and an internal or lining mucous membrane, which is continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the uterus, and at the opposite extremity with the peritoneum. The fibres of smooth muscle are mingled, as in the uterus, with immature nucleated areolar tissue. The mucous membrane is thin, pale, and soft, without villi or glands, and disposed in longitudinal plaits. It is invested by an epithelium consisting of a single layer of conical or filiform ciliated cells, the direction of the vibrations of the cilia being towards the cavity of the uterus. The 0 varies, testes muliebres, are two oblong, flattened and oval bodies, of a whitish colour and uneven surface, situated in the pos- terior layer of peritoneum of the broad ligaments. They are con- nected to the upper angles of the uterus at each side by means of a rounded cord, consisting of fibrous tissue, and a few muscular fibres derived from the uterus, the ligament of the ovary. By the opposite extremity they are connected by another and a shorter ligament to the fimbriated aperture of the Fallopian tube. In structure the ovary is composed of a spongy fibrous paren- chyma or stroma of a greyish-red colour, containing a number of small cells traversed by blood-vessels, and enclosed in a capsule consisting of two tunics, external or serous, derived from the peri- toneum, and investing it completely, with the exception of its lower border where the vessels enter; and internal or fibrous, called also tunica propria and tunica albuginea, the latter from its analogy with the fibrous coat of the testis. By its inner surface the tunica albuginea blends with the substance of the ovary. The stroma is composed of immature nucleated and fibrous areolar tissue, and, traced from the lower border of the organ, its fibres radiate from the lower border and centre towards the circumference in small bundles, between which and near the surface of the ovary, are seen a number of small cells or vesicles termed ovisacs or Graafian vesicles. The peripheral position of the larger ovisacs has caused a division of the stroma into medullary and cortical, in the latter of which, the ovisacs are chiefly found. The number of ovisacs in a single ovary has been estimated at from 30 to 100 or even 200 ; and their size varies from a quarter of a line to three lines in diameter. The Ovisac or Graafian vesicle, is a vesicle consisting of an exter- nal membrane and fluid contents. The membrane is composed of an outer coat, the tunica fibrosa, the theca folliculi of Von Baer; and an internal lining or epithelium. The tunica fibrosa is highly vas- Y y 2CORPUS LUTEUM. 692 cular, is connected to the stroma of the ovary by means of a loose areolar tissue, and is composed of condensed immature areolar tissue. Externally, it is whitish and firm ; internally, reddish and soft. The epithelium consists of round or polygonal cells with large nuclei, and a greater or less number of fatty granules ; the cells quickly lose their definition after death, and then the epithe- lium assumes the appearance which has gained for it the name of membrana granulosa, namely, a granular layer with numerous nuclei. The membrana granulosa forms an uniform lining to the ovisac, excepting on the side nearest the surface of the ovary, where the cells are accumulated into a small eminence, termed cumulus proligerus or germinal eminence. This germinal emi- nence contains a minute globular nucleated vesicle, the ovulum. The fluid contents of the ovisac, liquor folliculi, are a clear yellowish fluid resembling serum, and a few free nuclei detached from the membrana granulosa. The ovulum or future ovum, measuring in its mature state about Y^jo- of an inch in diameter, is a globular vesicle consisting of a cell membrane, the membrana vitellina, a yelk or vitellus, and a vesi- cular nucleated nucleus, the vesicular nucleus being the germinal vesicle, and the nucleolus the germinal spot. The cell membrane is clear and transparent, and has received the name of zona pellu- cida, and the yelk yellowish and viscid, consisting of numerous minute granules intermingled with fat granules ; the fluid of the germinal vesicle is clear and colourless. As the ovisac attains maturity, it approaches nearer and nearer the capsule of the ovary, and pressing against the capsule renders it so thin that moderate pressure, such as that made by' the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube, causes the protrusion and rupture both of the ovisac and the capsule of the ovary. By this rupture the ovulum is expelled, carrying with it the germinal eminence and part of the membrana granulosa, which in its new relation is termed the germinal disk, discus proligerus. The ovisac now emptied of its contents, is quickly filled with a san- guineous fluid, resulting from the tearing of its vessels, the internal portion of the tunica fibrosa becomes thickened and plicated, and converted into a yellow vascular tissue, while the external layer of the tunic retains its character of a white fibrous membrane. This is the corpus luteum, a yellowish mass with fast diminishing cavity, plicated structure, vascular, and enclosed in a thin fibrous layer. It retains these characters up to the second or third month of pregnancy, and then slowly diminishes in size, being gradually lost some months after parturition is complete, or reduced to a small whitish or dark coloured mass, corpus albicans vel nigrum. The corpora lutea, which are independent of pregnancy, false cor- pora lutea, disappear in the course of one or two months, and leave behind them a scarcely perceptible trace of their existence. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the ovaries are branches693 MONS VENERIS.—LABIA MA JOB A. of the uterine ; the spermatic or ovarian artery being distributed to the broad ligaments, according to Weber, and not specially to the ovaries. The arteries enter the ovary along its inferior border by numerous minute trunks, which pass in a serpentine course through its stroma, to be distributed chiefly to the walls of the ovisacs, forming an exterior coarse and interior fine capillary plexus. The veins constitute an ovarian plexus, which terminates in the uterine plexus. The lymphatics, few in number, terminate in the pelvic and lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the spermatic plexus, and take the course of the arteries. The Round ligaments are two musculo-fibrous cords between four and five inches long, situated within the layers of the broad ligaments, and extending from the upper angles of the uterus, and along the spermatic canals to the labia majora, in which they are lost. They are composed of smooth muscular fibre and areolar tissue, but towards the internal abdominal rings, have also nume- rous fasciculi of striated muscular fibres. The round ligaments are accompanied by a small artery, by several filaments of the sper- matic plexus of nerves, by a plexus of veins, and by a process of the peritoneum which represents the serous membrane investing the spetmatic cord in the male. In the young subject, this process extends for a short distance along the spermatic canal, and is denominated the canal of Nuch: it is sometimes pervious in the adult. The plexus of veins occasionally becomes varicose, and forms a small tumour at the external abdominal ring, which has been mistaken for inguinal hernia. The round ligaments serve to retain the uterus in position in the pelvis, and, during utero- gCstation, to draw the anterior surface of the organ against the abdominal parietes. EXTERNAL ORGANS OP GENERATION. The female organs of generation are divisible into internal and external; the internal are contained within the pelvis, and have been already described ; they are, the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. The external organs are the mons Veneris, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, meatus urinarius, and opening of the vagina. The Mons Veneris is the eminence of integument, situated on the front of the pubes. Its areolar tissue is loaded with adipose substance, and the surface covered with hairs. The Labia majora are two large longitudinal folds of integument, containing areolar tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling the dartos. They enclose an elliptical fissure, the common urino-sexual opening or vulva. The vulva receives the inferior opening of the urethra and vagina, and is bounded anteriorly by the commissura superior, and posteriorly by the commissura inferior. Stretching across the posterior commissure is a small transverse fold, the frcenulumCLITORIS.—HYMEN. 694 labiorum or fourchette, which is ruptured during parturition ; and immediately within this fold a small cavity, the fossa navicularis. The length of the perinasum is measured from the posterior com- missure to the margin of the anus, and is usually not more than an inch. The external surface of the labia is covered with hairs; the inner surface is smooth, and lined by mucous membrane, which contains a number of large sebiparous glands, and is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. The use of the labia majora is to favour the expansion of the vulva during parturition ; for, in the passage of the head of the foetus, the labia are unfolded and com- pletely effaced. The Labia minora, or nymphce, are two smaller folds, situated within the labia majora. Superiorly they are divided into two processes, which surround the glans clitoridis, the superior fold forming the prceputium clitoridis, the inferior its frcenulum. In- feriorly, they diminish gradually in size, and are lost on the sides of the opening of the vagina. The nympbse consist of mucous membrane, covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. They are pro- vided with a number of sebiparous glands, and contain, in their interior, a plexus of blood-vessels. The Clitoris is a small elongated organ situated in front of the pubes, and supported by a suspensory ligament. It is formed by a small body, analogous to the corpus cavernosum penis, and, like it, arises from the ramus of the os pubis and ischium at each side by two crura. At the extremity of the clitoris is a small accumulation of erectile tissue which is highly sensitive, and is termed the glans. The corpus cavernosum clitoridis, like that of the penis, is composed of erectile tissue enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, and is susceptible of erection. Like the penis, also, it is provided with two small muscles, the erectores clitoridis. At about an inch behind the clitoris is the entrance of the vagina, an elliptical opening, marked by a prominent margin. The en- trance to the vagina is closed in the virgin by a duplicature of mucous membrane of a semilunar form, which is stretched across the opening; this is the hymen. Sometimes the membrane forms a complete septum, and gives rise to inconvenience by preventing the escape of the menstrual effusion. It is then called an imper- forate hymen. The hymen must not be considered a necessary accompaniment of virginity, for its existence is uncertain. When present, it assumes a variety of appearances : it may be a mem- branous fringe, with a round opening in the centre; or a semilunar fold, leaving an opening in front; or a transverse septum, having an opening both in front and behind; or a vertical band with an opening at each side. The rupture of the hymen, or its rudimentary existence, gives rise to the appearance of a fringe of papillae around the opening of the vagina ; these are called carunculce myrtiformes.' 695 MEATUS URINARIUS. The triangular smooth surface between the clitoris and the entrance of the vagina, which is bounded at each side by the upper • portions of the nymphae, is the vestibule. At the posterior part of the vestibule and near the margin of the vagina is the opening of the urethra, the meatus urinarius; and around the meatus au elevation of the mucous membrane formed by the aggregation of numerous mucous glands. This prominence serves as a guide to finding the meatus in the operation of intro- ducing the female catheter. Beneath the vestibule at each side, and extending from the clitoris to the side of the vagina, are two oblong or pyriform bodies, consisting of erectile tissue enclosed in a thin layer of fibrous membrane. These bodies are narrow above, pars intermedia, broad and rounded below, and are termed by Kobelt, who considers them analogous to the bulb of the male urethra, the bulbi vestibuli. Behind these bodies and lying against the outer wall of the vagina are two small glands analogous to Cowper's glands in the male subject; they are the glands of Bar- tholine. Each gland opens by means of a long excretory duct on the inner side of the corresponding nympha. The mucous membrane of the external organs, about a quarter of a line in thickness, is composed of areolar and elastic tissue, without fat, and rich in capillary vessels. It is furnished with numerous papillae, which are large on the labia minora, smaller on the clitoris, and is invested by a squamous epithelium. On the internal surface of the labia majora, on the labia minora, and occa- sionally around the meatus urinarius and entrance of the vagina, there exist sebiparous glands; while on the vestibule, around the meatus urinarius and around the entrance of the vagina, there is an abundance of racemose mucous-glands, opening on the surface of the membrane by shorter and longer ducts. The glands of Bar- tholine are common racemose mucous-glands, nearly half-an-inch in diameter, and made up of pyriform glandular vesicles, lined by squamous epithelium, and surrounded by a dense nucleated areolar tissue. Their excretory ducts, more than half-an-inch in length, are invested by columnar epithelium, and surrounded by a thin layer of smooth-muscle cells, disposed longitudinally. The secre- tion of these glands is a clear, yellowish, viscous mucus. Vessels and Nerves.—The external organs of generation are abundantly supplied with arteries, chiefly by the internal pudic ; they terminate in a deep and superficial capillary plexus, as in other mucous membranes. Valentin has described helicine arteries in the clitoris. The veins returning the blood from the capillaries form a rich plexus, which is especially abundant in the bulbi vesti- buli of Kobelt. The lymphatics are numerous, and communicate partly with the inguinal and partly with the pelvic glands. The nerves are derived partly from the hypogastric plexus and partly from the sacral plexus.696 MAMMARY GLANDS. The Mammae are situated in the pectoral region, and are sepa- rated from the pectoralis major muscle by a thin layer of super- • ficial fascia. Their base is somewhat elliptical, the long diameter corresponding with the direction of the fibres of the pectoralis major muscle ; and the left mamma is generally a little larger than the right. They exist in the male, but in a rudimentary state, unless excited into growth by some peculiar or morbid action, such as the loss or atrophy of the testes. Near the centre of the convexity of each mamma is a small pro- minence of the integument, called the nipple (mamilla), which is surrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In females of fair complexion before impregnation, the colour of the areola is a delicate pink ; after impregnation, it enlarges and assumes a brownish hue, which deepens in colour as pregnancy advances ; and after the birth of a child, the brownish tint continues through life. The areola is furnished with a number of sebiparous glands, which secrete a peculiar fatty substance for the protection of the delicate integument around the nipple. During suckling these glands increase in size, and have the appearance of small pimples, projecting from the skin. At this period they serve by their secre- tion to defend the nipple and areola from the excoriating action of the mouth of the infant. In structure, the mamma is a compound racemose or conglome- rate gland, consisting of lobes, lobules, and gland-vesicles. The lobes, from 15 to 25 in number, have each a separate system of lobules and gland-vesicles, and a distinct excretory duct; hence, the mamma may be regarded as being composed of a number of separate glands, their excretory ducts converging to the mamilla, and terminating at its extremity by distinct apertures. The lobes are irregular in size and form, flattened, and bounded by rounded angles; they are made up of smaller lobes or lobules, and the lobules of other lobules still more diminutive, the smallest lobules consisting of round or pyriform gland-vesicles. The gland-vesicles, about of an inch in diameter, are com- posed of a structureless membrane, or membrana propria, lined with an epithelium of spheroidal nucleated cells. The gland-vesicles communicate with an excretory duct, and the excretory ducts of all the lobules unite to form a common excretory duct or canal for each lobe, ductus lactiferus, ductus galactophorus. The ductus lactiferus taking its course beneath the areola, dilates into an elongated sac or ampulla, sacculus vel sinus lactiferus, and reach- ing the base of the mamilla, contracts in size and bends outwards into that process to terminate at its extremity by a small aperture. At the point of escape from the lobe, the lacteal duct measures from one to two lines in diameter ; the lacteal sac is double that size : within the mamilla the duct measures between half a line and697 MAMMAKY GLANDS. a line, and the excretory aperture about one quarter of a line. There are from 15 to 25 ducts in the nipple, a number corresponding with the number of lobes composing the gland. The gland-vesicles are held together by a dense white areolar tissue, which unites the lobules into lobes, and connects the dif- ferent lobes with each other, forming a covering for the whole, and being itself surrounded with adipose tissue. The lactiferous ducts are composed of areolar tissue, which is homogeneous internally, and fibril! ated and nucleated and mingled with elastic fibres exter- nally. Moreover, according to Henle, there is an indication of longitudinal smooth muscular fibre. The fibrous coat of the lac- tiferous tubes is plaited, and their interior lined by a columnar epithelium. The mamilla or nipple is covered by a thin epidermis, pre- senting more or less pigment in its rete mucosum ; it possesses at the extremity a number of papillae, between which are the lacti- ferous openings, and it is composed internally of the lactiferous ducts, united together and surrounded by areolar and smooth mus- cular tissue, the latter giving the nipple the faculty of erection and retraction. The integument of the areola, besides possessing a coloured epidermis with numerous large sudoriparous and sebi- parous glands, the latter associated with fine hairs, is also pro- vided with a layer of smooth muscular fibre, which gives it a power of contraction. The secretion of milk is effected by the formation of oil-glo- bules in the epithelial cells of the gland-vesicles ; the epithelial cells being perfected, are pushed outwards and displaced by a new layer of similar cells which form beneath them ; they are thus carried forward into the lacteal ducts, where the cell bursts and gives exit to its oil-globules, now become milk-globules; and the cell-membrane and nucleus are lost. These milk-globules sus- pended in a fluid, the milk-plasma, constitute the milk. Previously to conception, the mammae only secrete a yellowish viscid mucus, and at the commencement of lactation the milk is imperfect and termed colostrum, having entering into its composition a number of cells filled with yellow fat globules, named colostrum corpuscles. The mammary gland of the male is rudimentary; it varies in size from a quarter of an inch to two inches in breadth, by one to three lines in thickness. It is firm in texture, presents no division into lobes, and its ducts are small without dilatations, and termi- nate in gland-vesicles larger than those of the female. The development of the mammary gland commences at the fourth or fifth month of embryonic life, at first by a papilla of the rete mucosum, which subsequently gives off primary and secondary branches ; the papilla and its branches are for a time solid, but as development advances they become hollow and invested externally by a fibrous membrane. At birth the gland measures between two and four lines in breadth, and presents from twelve to fifteen698 MAMMAEY GLANDS. lobular divisions, and then goes on gradually, but very slowly, in- creasing in bulk. True gland-vesicles do not make their appear- ance until the period of menstruation, and are not fully developed throughout the entire gland until the first pregnancy. After the period of child-bearing, the gland generally degenerates, the gland - vesicles disappear, and in old age the organ passes into a state of atrophy, the ducts, with their epithelium in a state of fatty dege- neration alone remaining, surrounded by a cushion of fat which takes the place of the glandular tissue. Vessels and Nerves.—The inammse are supplied with arteries from the thoracic branches of the axillary, the intercostals, and internal mammary ; having entered the substance of the gland they divide into capillaries, which constitute a close network around the gland-vesicles. The veins form an incomplete circle around the base of the nipple, circuius venosus Halleri, from which larger veins conduct the blood to the circumference of the gland, and by these communications form a plexus on its surface. They ter- minate in the axillary vein, internal mammary, intercostals, and jugular veins. The Lymphatics are abundant in the integument covering the mammae, but have not yet been observed in the structure of the gland; they take the course of the veins, inwards, to the anterior mediastinal glands ; and outwards along the border of the pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The Nerves of the mammary gland are derived from the anterior cutaneous branches of the second, third, and fourth intercostal nerve; and from the lateral cutaneous branches of the same nerves.699 CHAPTER XI. ANATOMY OF THE FCETUS. The medium weight of a child of the full period, at birth, is seven pounds, and its length seventeen inches ; the extremes of weight are four pounds and three-quarters, and ten pounds ; and the extremes of measurement fifteen and twenty inches. The head is Of large size, and lengthened from before backwards ; the face small. The upper extremities are greatly developed, and the thorax ex- panded and full. The upper part of the abdomen is large, from the great size of the liver; the lower part is conical and small. And the lower extremities are diminutive in proportion to the rest of the body. The external genital organs are large, and fully deve- loped, ;and the attachment of the umbilicus is one inch farther from the vertex of the head than from the soles of the feet; and one inch farther from the ensiform cartilage than from the symphysis pubis. Osseous system.—The development of the osseous system has been treated of in the first chapter. The ligamentous system pre- sents no peculiarity deserving of remark. Muscular system.—The muscles of the foetus at birth are large and fully formed. They are of a lighter colour than those of the adult, and of softer texture. The transverse striae on the fibres of animal life are not distinguishable until the sixth month of foetal life. Vascular system.—The circulating system presents several pe- culiarities: lstly, in the heart; there is a communication between the two auricles by means of the foramen ovale. 2ndly, in the arterial system ; there is a communication between the pulmonary artery and arch of the aorta, by means of a large trunk, the ductus arteriosus. 3rdly, also in the arterial system ; the internal iliac arteries, under the name of hypogastric and umbilical, are continued from the foetus to the placenta, to which they return the blood which has circulated in the system of the foetus. 4thly, in the venous system ; there is a communication between the umbilical vein and inferior vena cava, called the ductus venosus. FCETAL CIRCULATION. The pure blood is brought from the placenta by the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein passes through the umbilicus, and enters the liver, where it divides into several branches ; two or three of these branches are distributed to the left lobe ; one branch commu-FCETAL CIRCULATION. 700 Fig. 276. nicates with the portal vein in the transverse fissure, and supplies the right lobe ; and a large branch, the ductus venosus, passes directly backwards, and joins the inferior vena cava. In the inferior cava the pure blood becomes mixed with that which is returning from the lower extremi- ties and abdominal vis- cera, and is carried through the right auricle (guided by the Eustachian |T I valve) and through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed by means of the carotid and sub- clavian arteries, princi- pally to the head and upper extremities. From the head and upper ex- tremities, the impure blood is returned by the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle, it is pro- pelled into the right ven- tricle ; and from the right ventricle into the pul- monary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be circulated through the lungs and oxyge- nated ; but in the foetus the lungs are solid, and u u * Foetal circulation. 1.

TheF(BTAL CIRCULATION. 701 almost impervious. Only a small quantity of blood passes there- fore into the lungs; the greater part courses through the ductus arteriosus, into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mingled with that portion of the pure blood which is not sent through the carotid and subclavian arteries. Passing along the aorta, a small quantity of this mixed blood is distributed by the external iliac arteries to the lower extremities ; the greater portion is conveyed by the internal iliac or hypogastric, and umbilical arteries to the placenta ; the hypogastric arteries pass forwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder, and upwards along the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, where they become the umbilical arteries. From a careful consideration of this circulation, we perceive—1st. That the pure blood from the placenta is distributed in considerable quantity to the liver, before entering the general circulation. Hence arises the abundant nutrition of that organ, and its enormous size in comparison with other viscera. 2ndly. That the right auricle is the scene of meeting of a double current; the one coming from the inferior cava, the other from the superior, and that they must cross each other in their respective course. How this crossing is effected, a cursory examination of the foetal heart will show ; for the direction of entrance of the two vessels is so opposite, that they may discharge their currents through the same cavity without admixture. The mSeem cava opens almost directly into the left auricle ; and, by the aid of the Eustachian valve, the current in the inferior cava is almost entirely excluded from the right auricle. 3rdly. That the blood which circulates through the arch of the aorta comes directly from the placenta ; and although mixed with the impure blood of the inferior cava, yet is propelled in such abundance to the head and upper extremities, as to provide for the increased nutrition of those parts, and prepare them, by their greater size and development, for the functions which they are required to perform at the instant of birth. 4thly. That the blood circulating in the descending aorta is very impure, being obtained principally from the returning current in the superior cava ; a small quantity only being derived from the left arrows 12 and 13, represent the return of the blood from the head and upper extremities through the jugular and subclavian veins, to the superior vena cava (14), to the right auricle (8), and in the course of the arrow through the right ventricle (15), to the pulmonary artery-(16). 17. Ductus arteriosus, which appears to he a proper continuation of the pulmonary artery; the offsets at each side are the right and left pulmonary artery; these are of extremely small size as compared with the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus joins the descending aorta (18, 18), which divides into the common iliacs, and these into the internal iliacs, or hypogastric arteries (19), and return the blood along the umbilical cord to the placenta; while the other divisions, the external iliacs (20), are continued into the lower extremities. The arrows at the terminations of these vessels mark the return of the venous blood by the veins to the inferior cava.FCETAL ORGANS OF SENSE. 702 ventricle. Yet it is from this impure blood that the nutrition of the lower extremities is provided. Hence we are not surprised at their insignificant development at birth ; while we perceive the pro- vidence of nature, which directs the nutrient current, in abundance, to the organs of sense, prehension, and deglutition, organs so neces- sary, even at the instant of birth, to the safety and welfare of the creature. After birth, the foramen ovale becomes gradually closed by a membranous layer, which is developed from the margin of the open- ing from below upwards, and completely separates the two auricles. The situation of the foramen is seen in the adult heart, on the septum auricularum, and is called the fossa ovalis; the prominent margin of this opening is the annulus ovalis. As soon as the lungs have become inflated by the first act of in- spiration, the blood of the pulmonary artery courses through its right and left branches into the lungs, to be returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary veins. Thus the pulmonary circulation is established. Then the ductus arteriosus contracts and degenerates into an impervious fibrous cord, serving in after life simply as a bond of union between the left pulmonary artery and the concavity of the arch of the aorta. The current through the umbilical cord being arrested, the hypo- gastric arteries likewise contract and become impervious. The umbilical vein and ductus venosus, also deprived of their circulating current, become reduced to fibrous cords, the former being the round ligament of the liver, and the latter a fibrous band which may be traced along the fissure of the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava. Nervous system.—The brain is very soft, almost pulpy, and has a reddish tint throughout ; its weight at birth, relatively to the entire body, is as one to six, and the difference between the white and grey substance is imperfectly marked. The nerves are firm and well developed. ORGANS OF SENSE. Eye.—The eyeballs are of large size and well developed at birth. The pupil is closed by a vascular membrane called the membrana pupillaris, which disappears at about the seventh month. Some- times it remains permanently, and produces blindness. It consists of two thin membranous layers, between which the ciliary arteries are prolonged from the edge of the iris, and form arches and loops by returning to it again, without anastomosing with those of the opposite side. The removal of the membrane takes place by the contraction of these arches and loops towards the edge of the pupil. The capsule of the lens is extremely vascular. Ear.—The ear is remarkable for its early development ; the labyrinth and ossicula auditus are ossified at an early period, and703 THYMUS GLAND. the latter are completely formed before birth. The only parts re- maining incomplete are the mastoid cells, and meatus auditorius. The membrana tympani in the foetal head is very oblique, occupying almost the basilar surface of the skull; hence probably arises a deficient acuteness in the perception of sound. It is also extremely vascular. ]yose.—The sense of smell is imperfect in the infant, as may be inferred from the small capacity of the nasal fossae, and the non- development of the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses. THYROID GLAND. The Thyroid gland is of large size in the foetus, and is developed by two lateral halves, which approach and become connected at the middle line so as to constitute a single gland. It is doubtful whether it performs any special function in foetal life. THYMUS GLAND. The^Thymus gland* consists " of a thoracic and a cervical portion on each side. The former is situated in the anterior mediastinum, and the latter is placed in the neck just above the first bone of the sternum and behind the sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei mus- cles." It extends upwards from the fourth rib as high as the thyroid gland, resting against the pericardium, separated from the arch of the aorta and great vessels by the thoracic fascia, and lying at each side of the trachea in the neck. Although described usually as a single gland, it consists actually of two lateral, almost symmetrical glands, connected with each other by areolar tissue only, and having no structural communication ^ they may therefore be " properly called a right and left thymus gland." The thymus is perceptible as early as the seventh week of em- bryonic existence, and continues gradually increasing with the growth of the foetus until the seventh month. At the eighth month it is large ; during the ninth it undergoes a sudden change, assumes a greatly increased size, and at birth weighs 240 grains. After birth it continues to enlarge until the expiration of the second year, when it ceases to grow, and begins to diminish between the eighth and twelfth year ; being often well developed at the age of twenty, and only disappearing entirely before forty. The thymus is a blood-vascular gland, composed of lobules dis- posed in a spiral form around a central canal. The lobules are held together by a firm areolar tissue ("reticulated"), and the entire gland is enclosed in a coarse areolar capsule. * In the description of this gland I have followed the account of it given by Sir Astley Cooper in his celebrated monograph " On the Anatomy of the Thymus Gland," 1832.704 THYMUS GLAND. The Lobules, somewhat more than a quarter of an inch in diameter, of a rounded and pyriform shape, are composed of smaller Fig. 277* lobules, and the smaller lobules, which are hollow in the interior, are made up of small round or polygonal solid masses, the gland granules or acini. The gland granules, separate externally, are adherent by their inner borders, and enclose the cavity of the smaller lobule, the 1' secretory cell;" the secretory cells open into the "pouch" or cavity of the lobules, and the pouches of the lobules open into the central canal or cavity, " the reservoir of the thymus." The substance of the thymus is contained in the gland granules, of which the walls of the organ are constructed ; this substance is of a greyish-white colour, soft, about a quarter of a line in thick- ness, and placed between two membranes, a thin fibrous, almost homogeneous membrana propria externally, which invests each separate lobule, and is continued over the entire gland ; and a thin vascular membrane internally, consisting of a plexus of blood- vessels held together by a small quantity of areolar tissue. The proper substance of the gland is composed of cells, free nuclei, * Section of the thymus gland at the eighth month. This figure, and the succeeding, were drawn with the kind permission of Sir Astley Cooper from two of his preparations. The references were made by Sir Astley himself. 1.

The cells are pale, sometimes nucleated, and sometimes without nuclei, contain- ing a few scattered fat granules, and sometimes filled with fat. The 'free nuclei, more numerous than the cells, are round and slightly flattened, filled with homogeneous clear contents, and sometimes furnished with a nucleolus. The arteries form a plexus near the surface of the internal cavity, from which branches are sent into the lobules, and from the lobules into the smaller lobules and granules, the vessels always preserving their position at the internal part of the glandular wall, and terminating in a close capillary network. When either gland is carefully unravelled by removing the areolar capsule and vessels, which retain the lobules in contact, the reser- voir, from being folded in a serpentine manner upon itself, admits of being drawn out into a lengthened tubular cord,* around which the lobules are clustered in a spiral manner, and resemble knots on a cord, or a string of beads. The internal cavity or reservoir, which is most commonly a lengthened canal, but sometimes a space of moderate breadth, has a similar structure to the walls of the lobules, the external fibrous membrane being thicker and stronger, and the granular substance thinner, and provided with a plexus of large vessels. On its inter- nal surface are seen the apertures or "pores" of the "pouches" and " secretory cells," each pore being surrounded by a vascular mesh, which forms a slightly prominent rim ; but there is no epi- thelium, and nothing analogous in structure to a mucous membrane. The contents of the cavity of the thymus are, a whitish and milky albuminous fluid, slightly acid, and containing in suspension an abundance of free nuclei, with isolated cells, and when the gland is on the decline, certain peculiar bodies, first noticed by Hassall, and, named concentric corpuscles. The free nuclei are globular and oval in form, uneven in outline, various in size, and provided with a small central nucleus. The concentric corpuscles, which appear with the decline of the gland, have a thick concentrically striated cell-membrane and granular contents, while others much larger consist of several of the former enclosed in a common envelope, also concentrically striated. They are met with near the wall of the cavity, and probably result from some alteration of the elements of the granular substance associated with the degeneration of the gland. They are allied to the bodies termed corpora amylacea, found in the brain. In the human fetus the thymic fluid was found by Sir Astley Cooper in too small proportion to be submitted to chemical analysis. But the thymic fluid of the fetal calf, which exists in great abun- dance, gave the following analyticalf results : one hundred parts * See Plates in Sir Astley Cooper's work, t This analysis was conducted by Dr. Dowler of Richmond, z zTHYMUS GLAND. 706 of the fluid contained sixteen parts of solid matter, sisted of,— Incipient fibrine, Albumen, Mucous and muco-extractive matter, which Muriate and phosphate of potass, Phosphate of soda, Phosphoric acid, a trace. Fig. 278. The Arteries of the thymus gland are derived from the internal mammary, superior thyroid and inferior thyroid. The Veins terminate in the left vena innominata, and some small branches in the thyroid veins. The Nerves are minute, and derived chiefly, through the internal mammary plexus, from the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. Sir Astley Cooper also saw a branch from the junction of the pneumogastric and sympathetic pass to the side of the gland. The Lymphatics terminate in the general union of the lymphatic vessels at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian vein. Sir Astley Cooper injected them once only in the human fetus, but in the calf he finds two large lymphatic ducts, which commence in the upper extremities of the glands, and pass downwards to terminate at the junction of the jugular and sub- clavian vein at each side. These ves- sels he considers to be the '' absorbent ducts of the glands, 4 thymic ducts / they are the carriers of the fluid from the thymus into the veins." Sir Astley Cooper concludes his ana- tomical description of this gland with the following observations :—"As the thymus secretes all the parts of the blood, viz., albumen, fibrine, and par- ticles, is it not probable that the gland is designed to prepare a fluid well fitted for the fcetal growth and nourishment * Course and termination of the " absorbent ducts" of the thymus of the calf; from one of Sir Astley Cooper's preparations. 1.

VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. from the blood of the mother, before the birth of the foetus, and, consequently, before chyle is formed from food ?—and this process continues for a short time after birth, the quantity of fluid secreted from the thymus gradually declining as that of chylification becomes perfectly established." FCETAL LUNGS. The Lungs, previously to the act of inspiration, are dense and solid in structure, and of a deep red colour. Their specific gravity is greater than water, in which they sink to the bottom; whereas lung which has respired will float upon that fluid. The specific gravity is, however, no test of the real weight of the lung, the respired lung being actually heavier than the fcetal. Thus the weight of the fcetal lung, at about the middle period of uterine life, is to the weight of the body as 1 to 60.* But, after respiration, the relative weight of the lung to the entire body is 1 to 30. FCETAL HEART. The BTeart of the foetus is large in proportion to the size of the body; it is also developed very early, representing at first a simple vessel, and undergoing various degrees of complication until it arrives at the compound character which it presents after birth. The two ventricles form, at one period, a single cavity, which is afterwards divided into two by the septum ventriculorum. The two auricles communicate up to the moment of birth, the septum being incomplete, and leaving a large opening between them, the foramen ovale (foramen of Botarf). The Ductus arteriosus is another peculiarity of the foetus con- nected with the heart ; it is a communication between the left pul- monary artery and the arch of the aorta. It degenerates into a fibrous cord after birth, from the double cause, of a diversion in the current of the blood towards the lungs, and from the pressure of the left bronchus, caused by its distension with air. VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. At an early period of uterine life, and sometimes at the period of birth, as I have twice observed in the imperfectly developed foetus, two minute fibrous threads may be seen passing from the umbilicus to the mesentery. These are the remains of the omphalo- mesenteric vessels. The Omphalo-mesenteric are the first developed vessels of the germ : they ramify on the vesicula umbilicalis, or yelk-bag, and * Cruveilhier, " Anatomie Descriptive," vol. ii. p. 621. t Leonard Botal, of Piedmont, was the first of the moderns who gave an account of this opening, in a work published in 1565. His description is very imperfect. The foramen was well known to Galen. z z 2FCETAL LIVER. 708 supply the newly-formed alimentary canal of the embryo. From them, as from a centre, the general circulating system is produced. After the establishment of the placental circulation they cease to carry blood, and dwindle to the size of mere threads, which may be easily demonstrated in the early periods of uterine life ; but are completely removed, excepting under peculiar circumstances, at a later period. The Alimentary canal is developed from the inferior and middle layer of the germinal membrane; the former, producing the mucous membrane with its epithelium and glands ; the latter, the muscular and serous coat, together with the vessels and nerves. The Stomach is of small size, and the great extremity but little developed. It is also more vertical in direction the earlier it is examined, a position that would seem due to the enormous magni- tude of the liver, and particularly of its left lobe. The Appendix vermiformis cceci is long and of large size, and is continued directly from the central part of the cul-de-sac of the caecum, of which it appears to be a constricted continuation. This is the character of the appendix cseci in the higher quadrumana. The large intestines are filled with a dark green viscous secretion, called meconium (fjbrjKwv, poppy), from its resemblance to the inspissated juice of the poppy. The Pancreas is comparatively larger in the foetus than in the adult. The Spleen is comparatively smaller in the foetus than in the adult. It is developed at the end of the second month in the foetal mesogastrium, from the middle layer of the germinal membrane ; it is somewhat lobulated at first, and whitish in colour, but soon becomes red and abundant in vessels. FOETAL LIVER. The Liver is the first formed organ in the embryo, consisting primarily of two small masses of cells, appertaining, the one to the epithelial, the other to the fibrous coat of the intestine. The cells rapidly increase in number, the epithelial cells forming solid cylin- ders which ramify and anastomose with each other, and finally con- stitute the secretory portion of the gland ; the other cells, included within the network of the former, constituting the areolar and vas- cular structure of the organ. Subsequently the solid cylinders are hollowed in their interior, and form the biliary ducts. Dr. Hand- field Jones considers the liver to take its origin independently of the intestine, namely, from the gall bladder, which is at first solid, like the columns of cells above described, and gives off two branches, one to join the intestine, while the other is developed into the liver. At the third week the liver fills the whole abdomen, and is one-half the weight of the entire embryo. At the fourth month the liver is of immense size in proportion to the bulk of the foetus. At birth,FCETAL KIDNEYS AND SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 709 it is of very large size, and occupies the whole upper part of the abdomen. The left lobe is as large as the right, and the falciform ligament corresponds with the middle line of the body. The liver diminishes rapidly after birth, probably from obliteration of the umbilical vein. KIDNEYS AND SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The Kidneys present a lobulated appearance in the foetus, which is their permanent type among some animals, as the bear, the otter, and cetacea. The Supra-renal capsules are organs which appear, from their early and considerable development, to belong especially to the economy of the foetus. They are distinctly formed at the second month of embryonic life, and are greater in size and weight than the kidneys. At the third or fourth month, they are equalled in bulk by the kidneys; and at birth are about one-third less than those organs. VISCERA OP THE PELVIS. The j Bladder in the foetus is long and conical, and situated altogether above the upper border of the ossa pubis, which are as yet small and undeveloped. It is, indeed, an abdominal viscus, and is connected superiorly with a fibrous cord, called the urachus, of which it appears to be an expansion. « The Urachus is continued upwards to the umbilicus, and becomes connected with the umbilical cord. In animals it is a pervious duct, and is continuous with one of the membranes of the embryo, the allantois. It has been found pervious in the human foetus ; and the urine has been known to pass through the umbilicus. Calculous concretions have also been found in its course. The Uterus in the early periods of embryonic existence, appears bifid, from the large size of the Fallopian tubes, and the small development of the body of the organ. At the end of the fourth month, the body assumes a larger bulk, and the bifid appearance is lost. The cervix uteri in the foetus is larger than the body of the organ. The Ovaries are situated, like the testicles, in the lumbar region, near the kidneys, and descend from thence, gradually, into the pelvis. TESTES. The Testicles in the embryo are situated in the lumbar regions, immediately in front of and somewhat below the kidneys. They bar?, connected with them inferiorly, a peculiar structure, which assists in their descent, and is called the gubernaculum testis. The Gubernaculum is a soft and conical cord, composed of areolar tissue, containing in its areolae a gelatiniform fluid. In the abdomen it lies in front of the psoas muscle, and passes along the spermatic710 DESCENT OP THE TESTES. canal, which it serves to distend for the passage of the testis. It is attached by its superior and larger extremity to the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and by the inferior extremity to the bottom of the scrotum. The gubernaculuin is surrounded by a thin layer of muscular fibres, the cremaster, which pass upwards upon this body to be attached to the testis. Inferiorly the mus- cular fibres divide into three processes, which,- according to Curling,* are thus attached : "The external and broadest is connected to Poupart's ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle forms a lengthened band, which escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends to the bottom of the scrotum, where it joins the dartos ; the internal passes in the direction inwards, and has a firm attachment to the os pubis and sheath of the rectus muscle. Be- sides these a number of muscular fibres are reflected from the internal oblique on the front of the gubernaculum." The Descent of the testicle is gradual and progressive. Between the fifth and sixth month it has reached the lower part of the psoas * "On the Structure of the Gubernaculum," &c, by Mr. Curling, Lecturer, on Morbid Anatomy in the London Hospital.

Cavity of the scrotum. % in this figure the testis has completed its descent. The gubernaculum is shortened to its utmost, and the cremaster completely everted. The pouch of peritoneum above the testis is compressed so as to form a tubular canal, z. A dotted line marks the point at which the tunica vaginalis will terminate superiorly; and the figure 2 its cavity. 3. Peritoneal cavity.

While situated in the lumbar region, the testis and gubernaculum are placed behind the peritoneum by which they are invested upon their anterior surface and sides. As they descend, the investing peritoneum is carried downwards with the testis into the scrotum, forming a lengthened pouch, which by its upper extremity opens into the cavity of the peritoneum. The upper part of this pouch, being compressed by the spermatic canal, is gradually obliterated, the obliteration extending downwards along the spermatic cord nearly to the testis. That portion of the peritoneum which imme- diately surrounds the testis is, by the above process, cut off from its continuity with the peritoneum, and is termed the tunica vaginalis ; and as this membrane must be obviously a shut sac, one portion of it investing the testis, and the other being reflected so as to form a loose bag around it, its two portions have received the appellations of tunica vaginalis propria, and tunica vaginalis reflexa. The descent of the testis is effected by means of the traction of the mijiscle of the gubernaculum, the cremaster. "The fibres," writes Mr. Curling, "proceeding from Poupart's ligament and the obliquus internus, tend to guide the gland into the inguinal canal; those attached to the os pubis, to draw it below the abdominal ring ; and the process descending to the scrotum, to direct it to its final destination." During the descent, "the muscle of the testis is gradually everted, until, when the transition is completed, it forms a muscular envelope external to the process of peritoneum, which surrounds the gland and the front of the cord." " The mass com- posing the central part of the gubernaculum, which is so soft, lax, and yielding as in every way to facilitate these changes, becomes gradually diffused, and, after the arrival of the testicle in the scrotum, contributes to form the loose cellular tissue which after- wards exists so abundantly in this part." The attachment of the gubernaculum to the bottom of the scrotum is indicated throughout life by distinct traces.INDEX.

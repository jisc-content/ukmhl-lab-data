ADVERTISEMENT. IN this small Work, the Author has delivered a very brief Outline of a Natural Systematic Arrange- ment and Theory of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and of the Materia Medica, as strictly dependent on each other. Of this system the tendency is, not to controvert one established fact of Medical Science, but by point- ing out their relations, to simplify, to consolidate and if possible to increase the amount of our knowledge in all the departments of Medicine. As a work of this kind is a fair object of criticism ; to the philosophic and liberal reviewer I have only to say, that I shall most willingly submit to his de- cision. Error is almost inseparable from propositions of any extent or magnitude, and I have doubtless com- mitted many. But to the reviewers for the Edin- burgh Medical and Surgical Journal, and those of a London Review under their influence, as they consti- tute a party somewhat in opposition to my views, I have to observe, that, should they act unjustly, as I know them not individually, I must hold their edi- tor, whom I do know, responsible for their conduct, and I consequently shall do so.

15 ON ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. gree, tliat their aliment, in order to be conveniently di- gested, must posses a composition analogous to that of their organs. Thus, the independence which the functions acquire, and the interruptions which their operations present to each other, subjects them to the common laws of impeded mo- tion, and its result, a separation of parts. When, in manhood, their unison is most complete, life is most vigorous. When, in old age, this unison ceases, life disappears. Hence also, I am convinced, it is, that those animals whose functions are longest dependent on each other, and who remain longest helpless, longest enjoy organic existence. As motion only can result from motion, so life can only result from life. The vital actions of all animals ori- ginate in those of their parents, from whom they are de- tached precisely when their actions become sufficiently in- dependent of them. I am convinced it is upon this prin- ciple, that the egg is detached from the ovary and the foetus fiom the uterus, as well as because, in these cases, the ovary and the uterus themselves, after long quiescence, recover an independent action of their own. The same power which enables an organic body to act by itself, forces it to separate from another. Life then seems, in a great measure, to consist in the i successive attraction and repulsion of particles-properties equally common to minerals, vegetables and animals, though in different manners and degrees. Life, however, “ ”0t \ere *° be confounded with sensibility, which never, theless I shall afterwards shew is also possessed by all of them Life seems inseparable from generation, nutrition and decay, or, in other words, from origin, increase, di. mmution—a progression which minerals and vegetables

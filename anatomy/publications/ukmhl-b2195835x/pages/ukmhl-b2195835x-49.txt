Thus it can serve no useful purpose to reckon them one disease, while it destroys every natural arrangement and all the invaluable consequences dependent on it, and absolutely leads first to confusion, next to false reasoning and then to the most fatal errors in actual practice. Although, however, nosology must thus, in any thing like a natural arrangement, be fixed most accurately upon the basis of physiology, the classification of every disease may be derived from the particular derangement of that in- dividual function which occasions the derangement of all the rest, and not from the derangement of all the three functions which would render names uselessly complex.— I say uselessly, because, as the whole of any one disease, commonly so termed, is primarily dependent on the de- rangement of one function, so health is to be recovered chiefly by the restoration of that function, and the mode of cure is chiefly indicated by the name of genus under which the disease is primarily arranged. This last is one of the most important consequences of such a system. If, however, the names of diseases and their classifi- cation are not thus made dependent most strictly on each specific change from the healthy state described in physio- logy, they are at once arbitrary and unnatural; the patho- logy and nosology of which they constitute a part,'have i not their foundation in physiology, nor is the practice con- ■ structed upon them indicated by the reasonings it delivers. To reckon a series of occurrences which entirely dif- i fer in their nature, consequences and mode of cure, as one disease, may serve the purposes of common language, but by 10 means those of medical science and medical arrange- | ment.

OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 2 1 supposition that motion is made use of in the most myste- rious operations of the mind, possibly detract from the ho- nour of a Deity, o> from our admiration of natural ope- rations. We have little need to be afraid of a moderate and ra- tional materialism. It is the idealism of Berkeley, it is , the scepticism of Hume—those dangerous opponents of such materialism, that have so deeply injured philosophy and religion. It is according to these systems, that pro- phets, apostles and miracles, are only ideas in the mind; and, indeed, the unreasonable dislike to a rational mate- rialism, is alone chargeable with having led to the dange- rous scepticism of Hume. That physiologists, then, should so long have per- mitted others to encroach upon their proper province, is disgraceful to them, and has been most mischievous to science. To this is owing the barbarism of the doctrine of mind. As physiologists abandoned it, philosophers found it difficult to give it a name.—Some called it morals— others metaphysics—and others, the philosophy of the mind. But I have just endeavoured to shew, that it is neither morals nor metaphysics, nor the philosophy of the mind —but the philosophy of tKe intellectual organs of the hu- man body.

PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 35 C 2 each part the other, is and ought to be the true and brief confutation and suppression of all the smaller sorts of ob- jections. ” I shall now, however, further explain the principles upon which the natural system is constructed. The correctness of this arrangement, as strictly found- ed on physiology, is confirmed by the following observa- tions. Disease is change of the healthy state and of the heal- thy action of parts. It is change of the state as well as of the action of parts, because action depends on state, life itself on organization, and it is only by affecting this state —the structure of the objects acting, that change of action can be produced. In fracture, as far as the bone is con- cerned, the action peculiar to it—loco-motion is affected ; as the blood-vessels are ruptured, their action is affected ; as the nerves are injured, their peculiar action is also af- fected. Thus each has its peculiar action, and the action of each is affected through the medium of its structure ; but the affection of the state and action of the vessels or nerves is not, in fracture, the primary disease, but only an extension of it to other parts or other functions, or, more properly, they are new diseases, because they affect new i unctions, and, though dependent upon it, are, in their na- ture, entirely different from fracture—the primary disease. The action, for instance, of vessels in absorbing, cir- culating and secreting, so far as, in vegetables, for in- stance, the form and arrangement of their capillary tubes are concerned, or the continuation of the action commenced

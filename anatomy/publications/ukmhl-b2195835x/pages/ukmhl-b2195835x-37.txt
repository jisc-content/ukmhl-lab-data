PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE- 27 Certainly, in all diseases, the nervous functions must be affected ; but they may be affected through the vital or mechanical functionsâ€”by means, for instance, of an aneu- rism or a fracture. A fracture or an aneurism, however, have no existence as diseases under the Brownonian system. These are whimsically, absurdly, termed stimuli; not dis- eases, but mere causes of disease ; and the attention of the physician is, upon the principles of that hypothesis, ridicu- lously turned from the immediate disease to others depend- ing upon it, to the state of the nervous functions. And for what purpose ? Not, by their aid, as mere accessary and subordinate considerations, which in this case they really axe, to regulate the disease of the mechanical or vital functions, from the very first the most obvious, but in order to discover the very existence of any disease; as if fracture or ""eurisrn in themselves were not alarming diseases, in- dependently of their effects upon other parts of the system -t as if the injury done to the mechanical functions, to loco- motion, was less worthy the name of disease than that done to the intellectual functions, to nervous motion. Yet, in practice, the Bronwonian, even supposing that the nervous system were little or not at all affected, would instantly abandon his hypothesis, and demonstrate its inapplicability, by recurring to the injury of the mechanical functions, by setting the fractured limb, or operating for the aneurism. In the first of these instances, indeed, the primary disease, almost the only one worthy of consideration, is the injury done to the mechanical functions, to locomotion, which has absolutely nothing to do with excitability or excitement. It is not my view, however, intirely to exclude these systems, or to depreciate their real value, but to show that they merely form portions of a natural system. Still no system of the medical art can be perfect, which does not

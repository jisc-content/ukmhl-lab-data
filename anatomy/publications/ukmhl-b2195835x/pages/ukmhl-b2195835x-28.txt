18 OUTLINE Of A NATURAL SYSTEM dent on each other. The dicotyledons, which possess irri- tability, sleep and the principle of life most diffused, and which, among plants, are analogous to the dicordated ani- mals, namely quadrupeds and birds, possess concentric fibres and the most diffused sensibility ; the monocotyle- dons, analogous to the monocordated animals, namely rep- tiles and fishes, possess more numerous centers and less diffused sensibility ; and the acotyledons, analogous to the acordated animals, possess most numerous centers and least diffused sensibility. As, in some worms and zoophytes, there is indeed no appearance of nerves, and certainly none in plants, which yet possess sensibility, all this gradually approaches to the attraction and repulsion of the magnet and electrics, which,, like some of these, are divisible almost to infinity, and! yet possess their various powers, which, like the sensibi- ■ lity of the superior animals, connected by nerves, are only evidenced when led by conductors. Hence, I conclude, that sensation, understood in this. limited sense, as distinct from perception, and differing,. totocoelo, from soul, is, like extension, an imprescriptible; property of all matter ; but it may exist in as many forms • and as many relations as it; in its separate particles; larger combinations, as polypes; in still larger ones,, as ■ worms and insects, where these extended and. sentient. particles, connected by nerves, have more extensive rela- tions and more complete dependence on each other; or uni- ting to constitute perception in whole bodies, as m U . more perfect animals, where a sensorium commune exists, and where, in consequence of the most exquisite arrange- ment, and the finest relations, no particle can be derange without affecting all the rest.

48 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF In order, however, to perform the operation through- out, the point which I have indicated must be the center of an incision through the integuments made in the line above mentioned, and must extend at least two parts inward and two outward from the central point. Over the Trapezius outward, and over the clavicular attachment of the Sterno- cleidomastoid muscle inward, it is not adviseable to cut deeper than the integuments, which sufficiently relieves the hand of the operator, without the present execrable practice of dividing the last mentioned muscle, which is not only unnecessary, but highly faulty, as this attachment serves as one of those particular points, above alluded to, inciden- tal to certain operations, which, by means of its edge, kept lax during the operation, very nearly directs the knife to a small protuberance on the superior anterior surface of the first rib to which the scalenus primus is attached, and im- mediately external to which the artery itself lies. Above all, the incision ought to be cautiously con- tinued on the inner side, in order to avoid the large veins situate there ; various branches of these veins may come in the way, and the more considerable may be easily avoid- ed, but if not, they may be tyed. In continuing the incision inward and downward, an ascending branch of the vein is in the way, which, when it is considerable, may also, previous to the continuance of the incision, be tyed. The incision itself, as you pass inwaid, must be very limited indeed, as the jugular vein is internal to itj; and external to it there is a twig of the brachial nerve, both of which are much exposed to injury. When the incision has been made one and a fourth of these proportional parts inward from the outside of the cla- vicle, you have reached the artery. It lays external to that protuberance of the first rib into which, as already observed.

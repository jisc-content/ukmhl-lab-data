3b‘ OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF in these tubes, or the effusion of their contents when rup- ture!, is evidently independent of nerves; and I believe, were this principle traced further, it would be found to ac- count for many of the actions of animal as well as vege- • table parts. Whether true or false, however, it cannot ma- terially affect the system. For whether their action is de- pendent on nerves or not, it is, strictly speaking, their own action, and, by injury, they are rendered incapable of per- forming it. Disease may thus properly be defined, any change of the healthy state and healthy function of parts. If any one urge, that disease implies the action, not the state of parts, I grant it; but must observe that change of state is action, and change of healthy state is evidently morbid ac- tion or disease, whether it arises from within or without, whether suddenly from external and accidental causes, or more slowly within the body and in dependence upon other previous derangement. Indeed to trace any disease back through previous derangement is actually to trace out other diseases, and to define any disease from others thus traced out, is to abandon those distinctions which separate the termi- nation of one disease from the commencement of ano- ther. If any one still assert, that disease is not change of the state but change of the action of parts, and urge that those accidents which depend on external causes, as frac- ture, considered in themselves, are not disease, I should say, were this even proved, it could only affect my ar- rangement by giving the term injuries, instead of diseases, to the first class. As, however, it seems to me that they may justly be named diseases, and that practically considered they are precisely the same, I shall retain that term. Thus, we shall have a fairer view of the interesting analogies

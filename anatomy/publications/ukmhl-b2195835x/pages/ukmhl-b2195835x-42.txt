32 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM Or As, however, no general theory of physiology exists, it becomes necessary to inquire what systematic arrange- ment can be given to its facts, as strictly founded on those of anatomy, in order to obtain one. And I know none so unexceptionable as that arrangement which I have already publicly delivered, nor any general theory so rational as the one which results from it. I shall now, therefore, restate these arrangements, and then try their applicability to the medical art. Anatomy I divide into three parts, namely, that which considers the mechanical or loco-motive organs, that which considers the vital organs, and that which considers the intel- lectual organs. Under the mechanical or loco-motive organs, I class, first, the bones which support the rest of the animal struc- ture ; second, the ligaments which unite them; and, third, the muscles which move them. digestion, the absorbent surfaces, and the vessels which ab- sorb from these surfaces ; second, the heart, lungs and blood-vessels which derive their contents (the blood) from the absorbed lymph ; and, third, the organs of secretion which separate various matters from the blood. Under the intellectual organs, I class, first, the organs of sense, where impressions take place; second, the brain or organ of judgment, where these excite idea$; and, third, the nerves, where volition results from the last. This is a natural arrangement of the anatomy of ani- mals, and its peculiar simplicity is illustrated by its involv- ing, in application, that of minerals and vegetables, and

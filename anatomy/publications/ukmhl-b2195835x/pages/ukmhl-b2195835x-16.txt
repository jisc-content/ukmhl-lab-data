OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM 6 Throughout this division in particular, the analogies from vegetables will be explained. III. In that part of the course which relates to the in- tellectual organs and funstions, will be explained the struc- ture and uses, 1st, of the organs of sense which receive im- pressions from external objects; 2dly, of the brain, where these impressions excite ideas, and, 3dly, of the spinal marrow and nerves, where volition results from the last. In this division, will be also explained, as founded upon original observations, certain criteria of the various degrees of the sensitive, perceptive and voluntary powers possessed by different animals, as well as the nature of sensation, per- ception and volition themselves. As in physiological enquiries, comparative anatomy ind comparative views alone can destroy an hypothesis or transmute it into a theory, I shall throughout the course in. troduce all its principal facts. . The machines, says Cuvier, which are the object of our researches, cannot be demonstrated without being de- stroyed. We have no means of discovering what would result from the absence of one or several of their parts, and consequently we remain ignorant of the operat.on.of each of these parts in producing the total effect. Fortunately, nature herself seems to have prepared for us the means of supplying that want wh.A arises from the impossibility of making certain experiments on living bo. dies. The different classes of animals ex 11 it a mos a the possible combinations of organs. We Sod them united, two and two, three and three, and in all proportions ; while a, the same time it may be said that there rs no organ of which some class or some genus is not deprived A care- ful examination of the effects which result from thesemmoi and privations is therefore sufficient to enable us to form

PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 55 cise with the sabre. Contrast this with the plain and man- ly operator, every movement of whose knife has a mean- ing, because every movement of it is strictly adapted to effect the most useful of purposes.* * It may be surprising, but it is not inconsistent with human nature, that such men should be the persecutors of others; and it may perhaps be worth while to quote a few sen- tences from the production of such men directed against myself. u While an intimate acquaintance with the Anatomy of the human body, is absolutely necessary to him who wishes to practise Surgery, with credit and success, it must be ac- knowledged, that those who are much occupied with dissec- tion, are but too apt to overrate the practical importance of a minute knowledge of healthy structure. That surgeon would indeed justly hazard the imputation of rashnessand presumption, who would (shouldis here meant) imprudently venture to apply a ligature to the carotid or subclavian arteries, or attempt to re- move the stricture in a strangulated crural hernia, without an ac- curate knowledge of the assemblage of important vessels which are included in the regions of the neck and groin : yet we do not allow ourselves to be much influenced by the opinions of the anatomist who affirms, that there are certain fixed and invu- liable inles, according to which, in every case, those opera- tions are to be performed. We have learnt to infer, that the ditlerent regions of the body include almost constantly similar organs in every individual; and we know, that these organs have usually a general relation to each other, in form, mag- nitude, and position. Yet very little further observation is sufficient to convince us, that these relations do not admit of being determined with mathematical precision. The form and position of parts, ascertained with the most scrupulous accuracy in one individual, are not to be adopted as the basis of a system of rules, by which the operative surgeon B 4

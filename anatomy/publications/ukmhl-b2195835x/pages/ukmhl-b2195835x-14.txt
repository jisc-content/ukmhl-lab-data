4 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM which considers the vital organs, and that which considers the intellectual organs. Under the mechanical or loco-motive organs, T class, first, the bones which support the rest of the animal struc- ture ; second, the ligaments which unite them ; and third, the muscles which move them. Under the vital organs, I class, first, the organs of digestion, the absorbent surfaces, and the vessels which ab- sorb from these surfaces; second, the heart, lungs and blood-vessels, which derive their contents (the blood) from the absorbed lymph; and third, the organs of secretion, which separate various matters from the blood. Then fol- low the generative organs, which, though generally formed into a distinct class from the vital, ought not by any means to be so reckoned. For it is evident, that they form, as it were, the sequel of the vital organs, being dependent on secretion—the last of the vital functions, and destined merely to propagate vitality, and to communicate it to a new series of beings. Under the intellectual organs, I class, first, the organs of sense, where impressions take place ; second, the brain or organ of judgment, where these excite ideas; and third, ‘the nerves, where volition results from the last. This is a natural arrangement of the anatomy of ani- mals, and its peculiar simplicity is illustrated by its involv- ing, in application, that of minerals and vegetables, and by its being capable of instant adaption to physiological science. In order to arrange Animal Physiology, it is only ne- cessary to substitute the term “ functions” for “ organs;” and that science will likewise involve, in application, the physiology of mineral and vegetable bodies, and be, in its turn, capable of instant adaption to medical science.

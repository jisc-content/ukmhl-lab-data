OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM 8 a tree thus cut clown retains humidity, as destructive to the trunk, of which it induces a rottenness, as too great a quantity of pus, that so habitually moistens the surface of an animal wound, destroys granulation and prevents cica- trization. In considering the application, or rather the relation of physiology to philosophy in general, the philosophy of mind will be particularly dwelt upon. In considering the application of physiology to the fine arts, the error in the construction of the antique statues, and of those of Michael Angelo, both with regard to the in- dividual* muscles supposed to be brought into action, and with regard to a hitherto unobserved principle of attitude, will be carefully pointed out. In considering the application of physiology to the me- dical and surgical arts, a view of a new, simple and im- pressive natural system of medical science in general, and of its first principles as an art, will be exhibited ; and rules will also be given for performing surgical operations with the utmost precision and ease, upon the principle of an in- variable relation between the arrangement of internal, and the situation of certain external parts, which consequently form accurate signs of that arrangement. I may now observe, that the series of beings which the arrangement I have just delivered involves, all more or less evidence the phenomena of life and intellect, as well as ex- hibit structure, and I may conclude with a few observations concerning these phenomena. Minerals have properly been said to exist, plants to exist and live, animals to exist, live and think.

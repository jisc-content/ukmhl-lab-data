46 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF of the body through any great nerve or vessel that is liable to be the subject of surgical operation. Having stated this principle, I may merely observe, that, proceeding with all the ease and security, such accu- racy must infallibly confer, it is, in all operations the first duty of the operator to ascertain by feeling, as nearly as possible, the thickness of cellular substance situate imme- diately under the skin of the patient, and then, with a bold and steady hand, to make an incision, deep in proportion to the thickness of that substance, and long in proportion to its depth, as well as to the additional depth and extent of the part to be operated upon. These general principles excepted, other subordinate rules are chiefly applicable to particular operations. In order to illustrate this general principle, I cannot adduce a fairer or a better example than that which, accor- ding to it, is necessary to direct the taking up of the sub- clavian artery above the clavicle. The patient must, in this operation, rest on the fun- dament, his body slightly inclining backward, so as to form an obtuse angle with the thighs, and his neck and head inclined backward so as to form with the trunk an angle similar to that formed by it with the thighs ; the in- ferior of these angles being concave, the superior convex. This last may indeed be more properly called an irregular segment of a circle, formed in consequence of the verte- brae of the neck bending in that direction. In this posi- tion, therefore, the neck is, in general, in the same paral- lel with the thighs. The head of the patient is to be turn- ed to the opposite side from that in which the operation is to be performed, where also the operator must stand. The

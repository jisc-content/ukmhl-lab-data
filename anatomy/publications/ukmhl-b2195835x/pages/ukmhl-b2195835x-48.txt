OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF 38 the last class, (sleep itself consisting in the quiescence of almost all the intellectual functions), dreaming consists chiefly in the quiescence of sensation, somnambulism chiefly in that of mental operation and incubus chiefly in that of volition. With regard to the articles of the materia medica, or rather with regard either to external or internal applica- tions, the correctness of my arrangement, as indicating their influence upon the different classes of organs, will, on the slightest consideration, appear equally evident; pres- sure, for instance, affects the mechanical, mercury the vi- tal and opium the intellectual system. But, like the dis- eases which they remedy, it will appear, that each of these also affects all of the functions, though in a less direct man- ner than that which I have just now particularly pointed out as its object, and upon which the exact place of each in a systematic arrangement ought to depend. It cannot, therefore, be a just objection to this ar- rangement, that it throws each of what are commonly call- ed diseases under these different classes, as, in reality, each âœ“ of the common diseases is more properly three, and exists under three natural classes. Even in this way, does every physician, though unaware of it, consider them, and there- fore, instead of giving any new complexity to nosology, it merely explains and simplifies that complexity which ever has existed in the nature of disease. In other words, it is natural, and developes and simplifies only the combi- nations of nature. Thus, no one disease, properly so called, can, with the slightest truth, be said to fall under three different classes, as inflammatory and suppurative phthysis, which are even commonly reckoned distinct stages, or as fracture, in- flammation, &c. which are essentially different in their

PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 51 the worst, will have to calculate,~ the latter will be unable to do more than guess. Thus I have answered the only objections that it is possible to urge against the principle proposed. I have already said, that private objections by per- sons who dare not publicly make one, and who them- selves cannot, by one or two incisions, approach with- in several inches of any artery, I shall uniformly despise, and shall only ask them to perform the operation with my youngest pupil. I shall now deliver a short history of the method pro- posed. The want of some guide to the situation of internal parts, has long been felt. Fixed points have been adopted, but with no regularity. Measurements guessed by the eye have sometimes been used, but even they have almost al- ways been absolute, i. s. measurements from one point; rarely proportional, i. s. measurements between two points. The few guessed proportional measurements, however, as for paracentesis abdominis, paracentesis thoracis, &c. which have been mentioned in surgical works, have, it must be confessed, been such as, from the magnitude of the parts with which they were concerned, required little more than guess. Such, however, as they were, they evi- dently depended upon no principle, but seem as if hit upon upon accidentally, and, at all events, were never generally applied. Precise or real proportional measurements between fixed points, applicable to minute objects, i. s. such mea- surements as I have proposed and described, never have been, as far as 1 can discover, proposed and described be- lt 2

' 40 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF In considering the natural arrangement of medical science exhibited above, it will be particularly necessary to avoid substituting the term “ organ” for function.” The term « diseases of organs” expresses merely the seats of disease, whilst the term M diseases of functions” expresses their nature. Nevertheless a reference may also be made to the various organs, as it is evident that there may be disease of the vital or any other function in a mechanical organ. Thus a tumour in a bone is a disease of secretion, or an ulcer in a similar situation a disease of absorption ; both being orders of the class—Diseases of the vital func- tions. The first principle of the medical art, therefore, is founded upon a knowledge of the relations subsisting be- tween the various states of the animal functions and the power of medicines, as exhibited in the preceding sketch of a natural system ; and it consists in the application of the articles of the different genera of medicines (exhibited in the last column of the table) to the cure of the corres- ponding genera of disease (exhibited in the third one). One of the most beautiful results of the principle I have proposed is, that, by its adoption, it will be possible for the physician to lay his hand upon the several columns of a table, each of which, with regard to the diseases which it enumerates, is precisely similar in its nature from com- mencement to end ; indicates correspondingly arranged ar- ticles of the materia medica, and requires precisely a simi- lar mode of cure.

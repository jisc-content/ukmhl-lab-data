30 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF inquire not the perfect cures of many diseases, but, pro- nouncing them incurable, do enact a law of neglect and exempt ignorance from discredit.” It therefore becomes proper to ascend to the cause of the little success which has hitherto attended medical in- vestigation, and to attempt, by the removal of that cause, to accelerate its progress, and, by increasing the success, to increase the respectability of the art:. The grand cause which has hitherto retarded the pro- gress of medicine, has been the total want of a general principle, and this want has arisen from the very low state of physiological theory. It has ever appeared to me that a sufficient distinction has not been made between diseases as affecting various functions, which to the most superficial observer seem to be very different in their nature. It would appear, at first sight, that, instead of almost uniformly applying mental remedies to mental diseases, the physician not only does • not distinguish what stages and parts of the same disease are mechanical, what vital and what intellectual, which must uniformly be the case where all the functions are in- volved, but that he does clearly perceive such a distinction at all to subsist in any form or combination of disease. The physician has also failed to attend to a correct ar- rangement of the various articles of the materia medica, which ought not to be considered merely as stimulant, se- dative, &c. but as in reality operating upon different func- tions. Besides these, there appear to be other subordinate objects of inquiry, which he has hitherto, to a certain ex- tent, overlooked; namely, that medicines seem to be ob-

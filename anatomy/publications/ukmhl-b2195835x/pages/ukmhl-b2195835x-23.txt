OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOIIY. 13 pulsion are weak ; when, in the vigour of life, these rela- tions are most intimate, these powers are greatest; when, in old age, these relations are interrupted, these powers are also diminished; and when, in death, these relations cease to exist between the molecules, or in other words, when the body is no longer organized, the power of combined re- sistance terminates. Thus, life is no forced state, but an intrinsic power arising merely from the intimate relation of these mole- cules, and the greater effects which, in such combinations, they are capable of producing, than when, in death, they h'tve become independent of each other, and their powers disunited, are capable of much less effectual resistance. Thus, it is, that I would endeavour to shew a conne- xion between the phenomena of living bodies, and the ge- neral laws of nature. This general and common motion of all the parts, says even Cuvier, forms so peculiarly the essence of life, that the parts which are separated from a living body soon die, because they possess no motion of their own, and only participate in the general motion produced by their union. Thus, according to the beautiful expression of Kant, the mode of existence of each part of inanimate bodies belongs to itself; but, in living bodies, it resides in the whole. When, I say, that life consists in motion, I make no assertion derogatory to the Deity, for every philosopher is of opinion that motion is to us as mysterious as life; and when I endeavour to trace in its phenomena a correspon- dence with physical laws, I conceive that I pay the truest homage to a Diety. At all events, it would be dishonest of me to give my sanction to opinions respecting a diffe- rence which seems to me not to subsist.

OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 5 These are all modifications of each other, as I shall afterwards shew; but, at present, I shall limit my obser- vations to the two last of these classes, and to the additional phenomena, namely those of life and intellect, which they more strikingly exhibit. I shall not, however, like some of the most celebrated modern physiologists, occupy my preliminary lectures with long details concerning their nature ; but, as I reckon life to be the mere result of organization, I shall, throughout the course, illustrate it in connexion with those organs on which it depends, and shall, at present, only take a gene- ral view of its nature. Life is a term which some philosophers have hitherto inaccurately employed as expressing an imaginary princi- ple, though it merely designates a series of dependent ac- tions. This they were doubtless induced to do by that ar- tifice which has ever induced weak men to assume an air of knowledge by giving a particular name to what they did not understand ; and the same artifice still induces such per- sons to blame those who endeavour to explain the pheno- mena of life according to obvious physical laws, precisely because a successful explanation would at once exhibit their ignorance and their desire to conceal it. Life has, with equal absurdity, been termed a forced state, though it merely evinces a series of phenomena in justest unison with those of the universe. I dissent, there- fore, from those who assert, that we employ the terms life and vitalforce to express what are apparent exceptions to general laws. This is only a repetition of the error of Brown. It was, however, an erroneous conclusion from accurate observations. For example, says Cuvier, let us contemplate a fe- male in the prime of youth and health,â€”that elegant vo-

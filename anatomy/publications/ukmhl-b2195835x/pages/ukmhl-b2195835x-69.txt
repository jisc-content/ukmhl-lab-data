At a time, when a successful conspiracy of adventur- ous ruffians are, at the point of the bayonet, establishing, from the Don to the Douro, from the Scheldt to the Cat- tarro, over all the fairest provinces of Europe, the most dreadful of military despotisms ;—at a time, wrhen, to the shout “ Avance, Avance,” louder and more tremendous than the noise of their guns, the myriad legions of France are carrying death and destruction before them, and sweep- ‘ together man and civilization from the face of the Con- tinent ;—at a time, when he who has “ sceptres tipt with coronets for his pallisadoes, kingdoms for his martello towers and kings for his centinels,” threats at once the li- berties and the existence of Britain, and stains every step of his career with perfidy and blood j—at a time, when it is the duty—it is the wish of every man of honour success- fully to defend, or, covered with wounds, nobly to die for the liberties of Britain and the emancipation of Europe— when all this is the case, what are not his duties whose sole profession it is, aided by science, to rescue from death or agony those whom tyranny has attempted to destroy, the genius of whose godlike art it is to save both friends and ioes ; and, upon whose knowledge, the existence and the fate of armies may, in no small degree, be said to de- pend.

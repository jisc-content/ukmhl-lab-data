20 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM pervades all nature, and every natural operation illustrates it. Nor do we merely find evident sensibility thus pro- duced by the various arrangements of matter : it is impli- citly dependent on all the changes of bodies, and is iden- tified with their motions, by being suspended whenever these are suspended. Of this, the hybernation of animals, the. winter state of most plants, the state of the embryo in utero or in ovo, of the chrysalids of insects, the nymphs of worms, and the seeds of plants, afford examples. Nor is this all: but evident sensibility may be pro- duced and destroyed at pleasure by a mere alteration in the arrangement of the particles of one and the same body ; as in the wheel animal, and the anguillas of tiles. Nor is even this all: you may, if you choose, by the mere arrangement of the particles of matter, as I shall af- terwards prove by experiment, at once produce myriads of animals, and bestow upon them motion, or in other words, the phenomena of sensibility. This, the experiments of Spal- lanzani, contrary to his own inclination, decidedly prove. If it be objected, that it may be as fairly argued, that sensation is something combined with these forms of mat- ter, I answer, that we are not entitled to suppose any thing an independent being which never appears but in combi- nation. Now, as we have shown that sensation is implicitly dependent upon, or connected with motion; and as this and ' all the other functions of the brain, are entirely the results and modifications of sensation, they also must be dependent on or connected with motion. Far be it from me to pretend to account for mental > operation by mere physical motion. But, that motion ac- companies all thess processes, I am certain; nor can the

PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 45 the following method. Nor can I say more in proof of its importance. I doubt not, that it will, ultimately, consti- tute the basis and dirept the genius of surgery. There exists no other method of effecting this, than by the enunciation of the following principle ; namely, that there is, especially in such parts as are not liable to be de- ranged by voluntary motion, an invariable relation between the arrangements of internal and the situation of external parts, which may justly be considered as accurate signs of them ; in consequence of which, by adopting, on each side of the nerve, artery or other subject of operation, a fixed point,, or one rendered fixed by particular positions of the body ; and by dividing, according to a line or rule, the space between these fixed points into a given number of proportional parts, i s. parts, not equally large in all sub- jects, but uniformly of the same size, with relation to the whole which they compose, and generally differing in the male and femaleâ€”by these means, I say, the situation of any given subject of operation, in any given part of the body, may be most accurately indicated, as being undevi- atingly a certain number of proportional parts distant from the one, and a certain number from the other of these points. Thus does anatomy, by what I term precise or real proportional measurements between fixed points, afford an obvious and simple, though hitherto unobserved, general means of rendering the operations of surgery perfectly pre- cise and easy. Indeed, such wonderful precision and ease do these real proportional measurements confer, that, by means of them, the finest instrument may be passed from the surface

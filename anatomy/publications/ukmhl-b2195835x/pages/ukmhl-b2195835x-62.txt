SO OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF I know not of any other objection that can be urged against it, and these I shall immediately answer. 1 st, To the objection that the accidental and probable fracture of the bone affording the fixed points would, by deranging these points, render all such measurements inap- plicable, I answer, that, to chuse as an example the ope- ration I formerly described, it is, in such a case, only neces- sary to transfer the measurement to the sound clavicle, and to convert the three inner or four outer proportional parts into absolute inches, quantities similar to which may then be measured from the corresponding ends of the fractured one, and thereby indicate the situation of the vessel or nerve with as great precision as if no fracture were in- volved. 2d, To the objection that varieties in the distribution of arteries, and those deviations which are often produced by disease, would have the same effect, I answer, that va- riety of distribution does not at all take place in some of ' those parts in which the most important operations have to be performed ; namely, high in the groin, above and be- low the clavicle, &.c. and that, wherever great deviation is caused by disease, it will generally be attended by exter- nal signs, according to which the operator may modify his measurements. I also further answer, that -wherever devi- ation, frotn either of these causes, occurs, he who, by means of these measurements, knows the precise situation, accord- ing to the most usual and regular structure, will have the most decided advantage over him who is ignorant of it: the former will possess data, from which he can calculate probable deviations, the latter none ; the former, even at

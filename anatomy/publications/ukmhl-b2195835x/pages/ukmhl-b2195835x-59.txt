PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 47 light must fall directly downward from the head of the pa- tient. In this case then, the bringing of the shoulder for- ward and downward, which I deem indispenible, however necessary to the ease of the operator, is not very material to the correctness of the measurement. It is however of some consequence ; for, as the subsequent measurement is dependent on the clavicle, and as that bone describes a portion of a circle in having its lateral end brought for- ward, every single point of it would, in that position, have a different relation to the vessels beneath from that which each would have had, if kept in its usual position. Here then, the shoulder being in this position, and the arm held by the side, the measurement commences, and the fixed point chosen on each side of the immediate sub- ject operation are the two ends of the clavicle ; as nearly between these as can be done, consistently with keeping quite clear of the bone, a line must be drawn superior and internal to it, and the given number of proportional parts, into which this line must be divided, are seven in number both in the male and female ; and now the situation of the artery may be most accurately indicated as being unde- viatingly three of these proportional parts distant from the inner, and four from the outer end of the clavicle ; in con- sequence of which, if a fine instrument, held at right angles to the clavicle, were directed downward and inward, it would at 1 and \ of the above mentioned parts from the surface of the clavicle, reach the artery, and being pushed farther, wâ€™ould pass through it. This is an absolute demonstration of the precision and ease attending the principle I have announced, and of its applicability even to the most difficult of all operations.

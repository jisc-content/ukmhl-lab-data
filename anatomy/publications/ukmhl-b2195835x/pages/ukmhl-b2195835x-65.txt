PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 5.'3 illustrating this operation in his lectures, first made the usual guessed -cut, passing across one half of the Sterno- cleido-mastoid muscle ; and, after some tearing and cutting, and innumerable complaints against the knives and the un- fortunate assistant, told his pupils, “ that they might think he had not yet got the artery, but he knew.he had, and he should know it in the living subject, even if it did not pul- sate.” The subject, however, was carried from the lecture- room, and the ligature was found to be firmly fixed upon the nerve.

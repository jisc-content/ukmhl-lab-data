5'2 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF fore. And these precise or real proportional measure- ments, between fixed points, differ exactly as much from guessed ones, as the accurate cabinet, which was regulat- ed in every part by the compass and square, would differ from the clumsy and unserviceable one, where every thing was constructed by guess. Here the parallel is so close, the difference in the results so striking, that I could not have adduced a better illustration. The present proposition, of precise or real proportion- al measurements between fixed points, was communicated by me, about five or six years ago, to James Macartney Esq. lecturer on comparative anatomy, and the laws of organic existence, at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and, in my opi- nion, one of the best comparative anatomists in Europe. I had no sooner announced if, than he assured me that a similar method had struck himself; and I deem this, so far as authority goes, no mean testimony in behalf of its value. Mr Macartney, some time afterward, performed upon the dead subject, in the dissecting room at St. Bartholo- mew’s, the difficult operation I have just described, accord- ing to the direction I have given, and both politely ac- knowledged me as the proposer, and bestowed on it his ap- probation. It is my duty to remark, that there is no per- son whose approbation could give me higher satisfaction. I cannot better illustrate the danger arising from igno- rance of this principle, than by quoting an instance of re- peated failure in the very operation above described, in consequence of such ignorance.

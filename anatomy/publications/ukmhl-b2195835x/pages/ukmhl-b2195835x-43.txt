PATHOLOGY AND-PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 33 by its being capable of instant adaption to physiological science. In order to arrange animal physiology, it is only ne- cessary to substitute the term “ functions” for “ organs and that science will likewise involve, in application, the physiology of mineral and vegetable bodies, and be, in its iturn, capable of instant adaption to medical science. Thus, the functions also are divided into mechanical, vital and intellectual. The mechanical functions are subdivided into that of support, that of connection and that of loco-motion. The vital functions are divided into that of absorption, 'that of circulation and that of secretion. The intellectual functions are divided into that of sen- sation, that of mental operation and that of volition. In order to arrange medical science, for the term “ healthy functions,” the subject of physiology, it is only necessary to substitute the term, “ diseased functions.” The classes of disease are, therefore, like those of anatomy and physiology, three, namely, diseases of the mechanical or loco-motive functions, diseases of the vital [ functions, and diseases of the intellectual functions. The orders of the first class, as affecting the functions of the bones, the ligaments and the muscles, are three, viz. diseases of support, diseases of connection, and diseases of loco-motion. / Those of the second class, as affecting the functions of the absorbent, circulating and secreting vessels, are like- wise three, viz. diseases of absorption, diseases of circu- lation and diseases of secretion. Those of the third class, as affecting the functions of the organs of sense, of the brain and of the nerves, are c

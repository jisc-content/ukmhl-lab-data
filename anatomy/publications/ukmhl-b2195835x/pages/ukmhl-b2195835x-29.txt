OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 19 It is indeed, these various degrees in which it appears, that afford a strictly analogical proof of its existence as a primary property of matter. As man then has not only sensation in the separate parts, but perception arising from the whole, the descent is gradual to beings which have merely sensation in dis- tinct parts, but no general perception ; and thence equally gradual to beings which have sensation limited to their in- dividual particles. Now, as the perceptions of two of the superior ani- mals cannot unite to form one perception, so the sensations of two parts of a polyp cannot combine in perception; nor • • — is it ot course more wonderful, that the sensations of two of the minute particles of matter cannot unite in one common sensation. As we do not expect electricity to be evidenced with- out conductors, why should we expect sensation, in any great degree, without those nerves which are its conduc- tors? It would be as irrational to deny the former, when conductors are not present, as to deny the latter (understood as I have defined it), when nerves are absent. Neither is it more wonderful that these sensations, thus limited, are not evidenced ; because it is scarcely to be ex- pected, that the functions of that should be evident, the abso- lute structure of which is unknown, and because it is exactly in proportion to the concentration of sensation (and by no means to its division) that it is, at any time, evidenced. Upon the same principle, it is, that the particles of a pigment, when in contact, are more evident than when ex- tended over an immense surface, or that a combination of pullies and one cord produce more evident motion than each of them, with separate cords, could separately. But it is unnecessary to accumulate illustrations—the principle B 2

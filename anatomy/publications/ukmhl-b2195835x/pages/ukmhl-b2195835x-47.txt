PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 37 c 3 hich, as will be seen, exist between the animal, vegetable and mineral worlds. Now, if disease consist in change of function, differ- ent diseases must either consist in different changes of the same function or in the changes of different functions ; the former, viz. different changes of the same function, as be- ing a more minute division, making evidently the genera which are subordinate ; the latter, viz. changes of differ- ent functions, as being more general, forming the orders which include these genera. From the inspection of the table, and a consideration i of the nature of disease, it will appear, that whatever is* commonly reckoned one disease, is generally, perhaps al- ways, three ; thus fracture is always accompanied by in- flammation and pain ; and while the simple fracture is a disease of diminished support, the inflammation caused by it is a disease of increased circulation, and the pain caused by it a disease of increased impression. As individual diseases are not arranged under the table, I may, in order to render my meaning perfectly obvious, give one or two examples of this mode of classi- fication. Thus with regard to the classes or first and most general divisions of disease, fracture is a disease of the me- chanical functions, syphilis of the vital functions, and snania of the intellectual functions. With regard to the orders or \ ; second and less general divisions of disease in the last of these classes, amaurosis is a disease of impression or sensa- tion, mania of mental operation, and paralysis of expres- sion or volition. And with regard to the genera or subdi- visions of disease in the second of these orders, fatuitas is a disease of diminished mental operation, mania of depraved ! mental operation, and vigilia of increased mental operation. i Farther, with regard to the combination of disease under

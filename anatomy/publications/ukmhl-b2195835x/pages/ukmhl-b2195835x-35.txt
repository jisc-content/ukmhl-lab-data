PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 25 were the measures of a barbarous; the last are those of a half-polished age. Fortunately, however, far from being formed to fear opposition—1 court it. The following sketch of a natural system of medical science is founded on the strict basis of physiology, and is, I trust, calculated to place, in a new and more interesting point of view, the beautiful relations which subsist between the sciences of anatomy and physiology and the art of me- dicine, as well as to lay the foundation of a more rational system of medical science. I do not, however, make this statement without a feeling of the utmost deference to the labours of the cele- brated Cullen and Brown—the authors of the existing sys- tems and of innumerable observations of the highest value in medical science. Nothing less than the firmest convic- tion of the truth aud simplicity of the system I am about to propose, could have induced me to deliver it. First, however, 1 shall proceed to exhibit the present state of medical science. No system of the medical art can be just in its prin- i ciples, and perfect in its application, which does not con- sider the derangement of the mechanical, vital, and intel- lectual functions distinctly, and trace each disease to the operation of its cause in the derangement of that particular function which was first produced, and which led to the derangement of all the rest. It has been the fate of all systems to be fouhded upon partial views of the functions. The system of the cele- brated Cullen, for example, was founded merely upon the vital functions, and even upon a very limited portion of

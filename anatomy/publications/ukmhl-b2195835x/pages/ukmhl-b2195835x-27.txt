OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 17 fact (the general truth of which may be granted), by com- paring it with another not less important, viz. that, in the inferior classes of animals, Jhe nervous system becomes, as you descend, more and more widely diffused. Hence, 1 deduce this important principle, viz. that the degrees of intellect are, in all animals, in exact pro- portion to the concentration of the nervous system. Now, the more equally distributed this system is, the more independent of each other are the parts of organized beings, or, in other words, the necessity of a connection of these parts increases, in proportion to the magnitude of the common trunk compared with the rami. It is only, therefore, in the more perfect animals, that the connection of the different parts ot the nervous system, and particu- larly the presence of central parts, is necessary to the ex- istence of the different functions. Animals, on the contrary, having this sensitive sub- stance very generally diffused, when mutilated, recover their figure, or, when cut into pieces, form several indi- viduals, having each a system of sensation and volition. The larger warm-blooded animals acquire pieces of flesh analogous to those which have been cut away â–  crabs ac- quire new claws; the tadpoles of frogs and water newts acquire new limbs and tails ; and the lower end of the snail, having been divided from the upper, acquires a new head. The earth and boatworm, when divided into consi- derable pieces, form several new individuals j but animals having this system still more generally diffused, as the polypus, when divided into the smallest fragments, each fragment self-exists and becomes a perfect indi- vidual. This also is more or less the case with plants. As you descend among them, their parts become less depen- B

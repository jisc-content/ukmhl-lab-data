PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 31 jectionable from the injury which they do to those func- tions which are the vehicles of their operation, the uncer- tainty also of their effects as influenced by association, the uncertainty of their continuance as dependent on the same and other causes, the difficulty of removing their bad effects, and the injury they do to the intellectual functions in mak- ing man entirely the creature of direct impression instead of reflection. I shall now, then, proceed to point out the mode of obviating this state. These seem to rne to be points eminently worthy of consideration, and the best mode of obviating the objec- tions they involve, is a greater attention to natural theory and arrangement. But, in order perfectly to remedy these great defects, the cultivation of physiology is primarily necessary. As far as the accumulation of facts goes, it has, however, al- ready been cultivated, and that most assiduously. But be- fore these accumulated facts can afford a principle of me- dicine, they must afford a theory of physiology, and, be- fore they can afford this, they must be arranged according to their relations to each other. I may here observe, that the sciences alone afford i theories, the arts admit merely of principles upon which these reasonings or theories are applied to the wants of man. Thus, in every step of their progress, the arts must im- plicitly depend upon the sciences. Now medicine is purely an art and admits of a prin- ciple derived from physiology by which the theories of that science may be applied to the cure of diseases.

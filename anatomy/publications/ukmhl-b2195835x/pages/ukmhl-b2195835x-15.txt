OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 5 A 3 Thus, the functions also are divided into Mechanical, Vital and Intellectual. The mechanical functions are subdivided into that of > support, that of connection, and that of loco-motion. The vital functions are divided into that ot absorp- tion, that of circulation, and that of secretion. The intellectual functions are divided into that of sen- sation, that of mental operation, and that of volition. A circle of functions, I may observe, thus exists in animals, which exists not in minerals or vegetables, because volition, the last of the intellectual functions, connects it- self to the mechanical ones, by rendering them subservient to it in loco-motion. Thus the first and the last of these functions are as intimately connected as any of the inter- mediate ones, and a beautiful circle of organic function and organic influence is formed. The plan of the course will, therefore, be precisely the same with that which I have proposed for Anatomy and Physiology in general. I. In that part of the course which relates to the me- chanical organs and functions, will be explained the struc- ture and uses, 1 st, of the bones which support the rest of the animal machine; 2d/y, of the ligaments which unite it; and 3dly, of the muscles which move it. II. In the first part of the course which relates to the vital organs and functions, will be explained the structure and uses, lrf, of the organs of mastication, deglutition and digestion, of the absorbent surfaces, and of the vessels which absorb from these surfaces ; 2dly, of the heart, lungs and blood-vessels, which derive their contents, (the blood), from the absorbed lymph; and, 3dly, of the organs of se- i cretion, which separate various matters from the blood.

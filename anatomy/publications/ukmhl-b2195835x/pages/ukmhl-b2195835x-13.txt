&F ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. A 3 In considering a natural arrangement of Anatomy and Physiology, it appears to me an unquestionable point, that it ought to indicate, at a single glance, the relation of all the functions to and their dependence upon each other. It is upon this principle that I have constructed the natural arrangement which I am about to detail ; and a single remark upon the arrangements adopted by the most celebrated modern physiologists, will, at once, shew the originality of the plan which I propose, and point out the errors of arrangement which T deprecate. Blumenbach, Chausier, Dumas and Bichat, treat of circulation before absorption, on which it depends, and even before mastication, deglutition and digestion, on which, in general, even absorption itself chiefly depends. If the arrangement of Chausier in particular, who, in this respect, is as accurate as any of them, were to be considered as indicating the relation and dependence of the functions, so absurd is it, that absorption instead of the cause, would be the result of nutrition, generation the re- sult of absorption, and digestion the result of generation. Thus, by arranging effects in the place of causes, they con- found the relations of the functions, and reverse the very order of their dependence. The division of the functions into external and inter- nal, as anciently proposed by Aristotle, and afterwards suc- cessively adopted and improved by Buffon, Grimaud and Bichat (the last of whom substituted for them the term3 organic and animal) is still more faulty. Anatomy, I divide into three parts, namely that which considers the mechanical or loco-motive organs, that

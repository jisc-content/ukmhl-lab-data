34 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM OF also three, viz. diseases of impression, diseases of judg- ment and diseases of volition. The genera, under each order, consist of diminished, irregular and increased function. This arrangement of disease likewise involves in ap- plication, that of minerals (if we choose to maintain the analogy and to give that term to mere injury of structure) and of vegetables, as well as animals. The first have what may be termed diseases of mechanical structure ; the se- cond have diseases of mechanical and vital functions; whilst the third have diseases of mechanical, vital and in- tellectual functions; corresponding with the observation that animals exist, vegetables exist and live, and animals exist, live and think. Precisely in the same way, would I class the articles of the materia medica ; first, as operating upon the me- chanical, vital or intellectual organs, and then as either in- creasing, rendering irregular, or diminishing their action. In this natural arrangement, I must again remark, that all its parts correctly correspond and beautifully flow from each other ; while anatomy is the basis of physiology, physiology, in its turn, is the basis of medicine ; the clas- sification of one is applicable to the rest, and all of them at once involve mineral, vegetable and animal nature. Such arrangement, as it lays the foundation of a new system of each, will, I trust, soon shed some light over anatomical, over physiological, and particularly over the dark paths of medical science ; but it must be remembered, that this exhibits merely a sketch of the application of my general arrangement to medical science, and that sketch necessarily brief and deprived of every illustration. Yet, even after this sketch, I think I may add, in the words of Lord Bacon, that â€œ the harmony of a science, supporting

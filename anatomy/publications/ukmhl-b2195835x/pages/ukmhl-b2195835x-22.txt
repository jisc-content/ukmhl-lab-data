12 OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM phenomena, and the last of these was, I believe, on that single account, considered as the symbol of life and intel- lect by the great Zoroaster. This and similar facts, I may remark, convince me, that the earth has myriads of times been illumed by the highest attainments of intellect, and as often plunged into darkness. This single point of Indian philosophy was, in my opinion, but the mere shadow of the highest excellence in philosophy in general ; and as the greatest cultivation of the human mind, and the greatest misapplication of its fa- culties, cannot well exist together, I am equally convinced, that the beautiful specimens of art, blended with heteroge- neous absurdities, in the monuments of Upper Egypt, af- ford the most striking proof that, contrary to the common assertion, there were periods in that country when tyrants held no despotic sway over the physical, nor the priests of a false religion over the moral structure of man. But to return to the subject.â€”True it is that the affi- nities of external agents with the molecules of organic bo- dies are precisely the same during life when their influence is resisted as after death when it operates with the greatest energy ; but the power which during life organic bodies possess of resisting the influence of external agents, and even the extension of the sphere of their action beyond the mere bounds of the living body, is, in my opinion, very easily accounted for.

While in infancy, these rela- tions are merely forming, the powers oi attraction and re.-

OUTLINE OF A NATURAL SYSTEM J4 The same causes which terminate motion terminate life. Life begins by motion, and terminates when it ceases ; but very curiously it also terminates in consequence of it. In other words, the motion wears out the machine in which it takes place. For, while the functions are most dependent, L life encreases; and their very independence, though, to a cer- tain extent, the grand aim of existence, destroys it. The very cause of decay commencing when the different functions have acquired their greatest vigour, arises precisely from their having acquired that vigour, and being, at that moment,, most capable of a species of warfare, if I may so term it, with each other, as well, as in some measure, from the greater number of accidents to which a complexity of func- tions is liable. That, at this period, the functions may, in a certain^ sense, be said to combat each other, will be evident to? every one who, for a moment, considers that great exercise^ of the loco-motive functions uniformly interrupts the vital', and intellectual, or of the vital functions injures the loco- motive and intellectual, or of the intellectual functions in- jures the loco-motive and vital. These powers are always in an inverse relation to eac other. Grimaud seems to have had some idea of this, with regard to the first and second classes of functions. He, says Richerand, has given the most extensive deve ope-- ment to the idea of the constant opposition between t os two series of actions, over which preside, according to the opinion of this physician, two powers, which he cal loco-motive and digestive. It is marked in no species o animals more than in the carnivorous, which connect wi senses abounding in stratagem, and muscles capable of ex- traordinary action, an assimilating potter o

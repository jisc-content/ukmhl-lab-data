OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. A 4 probable conclusions respecting the nature and the use of each organ, or form of organ. In the same manner, we may proceed to ascertain the use of the different parts of the same organ, and to discover those which are essential, and separate them from those which are only accessary. It is sufficient to trace the or- gan through all the classes which possess it, and to examine what parts constantly exist, and what change is produced in the respective functions of that organ, by the absence of those parts which are wanting in certain classes. Thus, says Richerand, the cellular structure of the lungs which cannot be clearly demonstrated in man, on ac- count of the excessive tenuity of their smallest lobuli, evi- dently displays itself in the vesicular lungs of salamanders and frogs ; in the same manner, the scales covering the bo- dies of fish and reptiles, or the claws of birds, give us a just idea of the structure of the epidermis, and of the dis- position of its small laminae that are laid over each other on a part of their surface, See. Vegetable life, justly, says the same author, compared in its resources and effects with animal life, would throw very great light on several phenomena, which, at present, it is difficult for us to conceive and to explain. The medical treatment of vegetables, which is almost entirely surgical, would be equally benefited by these re- searches. Thus the wounds of vegetables, like those of the hu- man body, are much less dangerous when their surface is smooth, than when their edges are rough, lacerated, or con- tused. Trees cut down with a saw bud with difficulty, whilst those felled with an axe vegetate more briskly.â€” The saw tears the vegetable structure and produces a greater or less alteration in organization. The unequal surface of

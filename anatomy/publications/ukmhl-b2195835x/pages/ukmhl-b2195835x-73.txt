POSTSCRIPT. 61 posing him.... Well, it must certainly be highly satisfac- tory to have thus opposed the progress of error and rescued the human race from disgrace and misery. Generous, dis- interested, philanthropic defenders of humanity, you have your reward in your own breasts. But their apology will not bear the test of ridicule. Let us therefore examine, in another way, the foundation upon which it rests. After denying the truth of the principle they ascribe it to another. And who is ignorant that this has been the fate of every original proposition ? M. Richerand, they say, discovered it in 1S05.

I mention these facts be- cause, even granting the truth of what these gentlemen state, it refutes the assertions they found upon it I shall make a point of laying the further details on this subject (to me very important) before the medical -world, which will show that, even since I first enunciated the principle, neither M.

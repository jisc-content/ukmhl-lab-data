PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 29 occasion, If it befall to me as it befalleth to the fools, why should I labour to be wise? And, therefore, I cannot much blame physicians, that they use commonly to intend some other art or practice which they study more than their own profession. For, you shall have of them, antiquaries, poets, t humanists, statesmen, merchants, divines, and in eveiy of j these better seen than in their own profession ; and, no doubt, upon this ground, that they find that mediocrity and and excellence in their art maketh no difference in profit or reputation toward their fortune ; for the weakness of patients and sweetness of life, and nature of hope, maketh men depend upon physicians with all their defects.” But Lord Bacon has assigned an amply sufficient rea- son for these circumstances.

For I find much iteration, but small addition.” Now it is, in reality, this profession without labour, this labour without advancement, so well expressed by Lord Bacon, this iteration without addition, which is the real and sufficient cause (overlooked by him) of the poets so properly making TEsculapius and Circe, brother and sister, and of the world uniformly placing witches, old women and impostors in competition with physicians.

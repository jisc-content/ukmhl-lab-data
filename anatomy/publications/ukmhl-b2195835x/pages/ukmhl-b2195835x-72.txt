POSTSCRIPT. 60 the triumphs of war, but the triumphs of lectureship in anatomy, physiology and surgery, which certainly involve, not the destruction, but the preservation of lives. What! M. Richerand, only at a thousand miles di- stance, influencing the newly organized courses of lectures in Edinburgh, and two copies of his dangerous book, pro- posing precise measurements in surgery, actually in the Butish empire.—Some gentlemen, perhaps, may be suf- ficiently ill-informed to imagine that the attack was really directed against so weak a creature as myself. How im- probable ! It is self-evident that I, in Edinburgh, could not have a thousandth part of the influence upon their lec- tures, that M.

PATHOLOGY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 49 ihe scalenus primus is inserted, and consequently to the in- sertion of the muscle itself. The twig of the nerve actual- ly crosses the artery immediately below the point -where the latter ought to be tyed. The course of the artery is, in descending, obliquely outward, and the precise space in which it lays resembles an isoceles triangle formed by the clavicle, clavicular portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus and the omo hyodeus ; its base being the clavicular portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. The nerve is external and anterior to the artery, particularly its branch. Both the twig and trunk of the nerve ought to be seen by the ope- rator before he attempt to take up the artery. These directions are so precise, that, were the operator blind and the artery destitute of pulsation, he need not scruple to take up that which presents itself in the above mentioned situation. By similar measurements, may every great artery in the body, liable to be the subject of surgical operation, be discovered with similar ease and precision, nor does there exist any other method of effecting this purpose. I shall now then state the objections which may be urged against this principle. . may be objected to the adoption of this fundamental principle of all surgical operation. 1st, 1 hat the accidental and probable fracture of the bone affording the fixed points, would, by deranging these points, render all such measurement inapplicable. 2d, That varieties in the distribution of arteries, and those deviations which are often produced by disease, would have the same effect. 7)

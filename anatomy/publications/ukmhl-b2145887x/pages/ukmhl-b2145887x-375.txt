THE VAGINA. 285 Pelvic Viscera in the Female. [The organs removed from the pelvis are to be laid out upon the table with the rectum upwards-; this is to be cleaned, and after it has been examined is to be dissected from the uterus.] The Eectum (Fig. 148, 19) corresponds in all particulars to that of the male, but is sometimes much distended. The description of the rectum will be found at page 277. [The preparation being reversed, the bladder and urethra are next to be dissected and examined. The peritoneum is to be dissected ur, from the bladder and left attached to the uterus.] ai&sected up The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) is more capacious than in the male and is directly continuous with the urethra without the intervention of a prostate, the relation to the vesicuhe seminales and vasa deferent* being of course wanting. The bladder is firmly attached to the neck of the uterus and front waU of the vagina. On each side of the upper part of the vagina the ureters ton upwards to gain the sides of the bladder, running obliquely for a short distance in the vesico-vagmal septum, then forwards obliquely through its coats to open by two orifices an inch and a half apart, about where they would open m the male (Savage). The structure of the bladder in thejemale corresponds closely to that of the male, which is given at The Urethra (Fig. 148, 6) of the female is a simple tube about an inch and a half long, the structure of which is best Ln by £It £ open with the bladder. The urethra is about a quarter of Til m diameter, but is larger near the bladder, this bein- also its most datable portion.

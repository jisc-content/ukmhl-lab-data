TERES MINOR MUSCLE. 31 tendon thoroughly, the acromial end of the spine of the scapula is to- he divided with the saw, when a bursa will be found between it and the muscle. The Infra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 10, 5) arises from the whole of the intraspinal fossa except the part near the neck of the scapula ; Fig. 10. from the fascia covering the muscle, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the teres muscles. It is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint, being blended there with the supra-spinatus and teres minor. The supra- and infra-spinatus muscles are supplied hj the suprascapular nerve. The Teres Minor Muscle (Fig. 10, 9) arises from the dorsal aspect of the inferior costa or border of the scapula in nearly its.

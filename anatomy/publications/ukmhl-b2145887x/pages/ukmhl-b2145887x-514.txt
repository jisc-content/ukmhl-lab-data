LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. 424 the transverse ligament. to a tubercle on the inner surface of the articular process of each side, and thus forms a ring .with the anterior arch of the atlas, in which the odontoid process of the axis is firmly held. The vertical slips of the cruciform ligament pass from the transverse ligament to the basilar process of the occipital bone and the body of the axis re- spectively, and by detaching the upper one the odontoid ligaments will be fully seen. The Odontoid or Check Ligaments (Fig. 224, 5) are two strong bands of fibres, which pass obliquely from the apex of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum on each side, and they thus check the rotation of the cranium and atlas upon the odontoid process Between these is a central odontoid ligament (hgamentum suspens'orium dentis), passing vertically between the margin of the foramen magnum and the top of the odontoid process. On cutting all the ligaments of the articulation except the trans- verse ligament of the atlas, the odontoid process will be found to be still firmly held in position, owing to the fact that the ligament sur- rounds the contracted neck of the odontoid process, which is consider- ably smaller than the head. There are two synovial membranes m connection with the odontoid process, one in front, between it and the posterior surface of the atlas ; the other behind, between it and

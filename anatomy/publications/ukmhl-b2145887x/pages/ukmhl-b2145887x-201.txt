Its named branches are (1) the coccygeal which pierces the great sacro- sciatic ligament to supply the parts about the coccyx; (2) the comes nervi ischiadici which runs upon the great sciatic nerve for a variable distance ; and (3) the anastomotic branch (Ellis) which passes to the root of the great trochanter to anastomose with the gluteal and internal circum- flex arteries. 1. 2. 3. 4.

298 KEMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. the surface of the brain to he partially seen. On each side of the middle line will he seen the glandule Pacchionii, which are fibrous growths from the pia mater, and frequently project through the dura mater and indent the skull. Ramifying upon the dura mater will be found the large middle meningeal artery [internal maxillary], and in a well injected body the anterior meningeal [ethmoidal] may some- times be seen. , „ , The Superior Longitudinal Sinus (Fig. 160, i) should be opened at once. It runs along the middle line of the head and will be seen to be triangular in section, being formed by a splitting of the dura mater and lined with venous endothelium. It commences in a small vein which enters the skull from the nose through the foramen cajcum, and, running along the whole length of the upper border of the falx cerebri, it ends in the torcular Herophih. Within the sinus may be seen some small tendinous cords-c/wnto Willisvi, and also the orifices of the veins opening into it, which all pass from behind forwards, i.e., contrary to the current of blood m the sinus itself.

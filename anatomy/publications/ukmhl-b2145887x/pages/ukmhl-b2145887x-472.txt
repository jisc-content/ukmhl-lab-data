The in- sertions of this and the following muscles are very generally damaged by the division of the base of the skull. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig. 202, 4) is beneath the preceding muscle, which must be turned aside to show it, It arises from the front of the lateral mass of the atlas, and partly from its transverse process, and ascends obliquely inwards to be inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, posterior to and further from the median line than the rectus major. The Rectus Capitis Lateralis (Fig. 202, 8) » now exposed although not a prevertebral muscle. It <mm from the upper surface oftransverse process of the atlas, ami is Umt* into the nnte Ite of le jugular process of the occipital hone. It separates the internal in«ular vein from the vertebral artery. The Longus Colli (Fig. 202) lies on the front of the cerv.ca ^ and is most conveniently divided into three portmns, .no oblique and one vertical.

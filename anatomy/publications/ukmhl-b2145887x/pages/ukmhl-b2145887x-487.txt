The Lips (Fig. 208) are formed externally by skin, and internally by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to them from the gums 5 Fig. 208. and between the two are the fibres of the orbicularis oris, with some cellular tissue and mucous glands and the coronary arteries. The fold of mucous membrane connecting each lip with the alveolus in the median line is called the frcenum labii, and is more prominent in the upper than in the lower lip. The Superior Maxillary Nerve. [The skull being placed with the base downwards, a cut with the chisel is to be carried in a straight line from the sphenoidal fissure to the foramen ovale. The side of the skull is then to be sawn through at right angles to the first incision, meeting it at the foramen ovale. The saw being then placed obliquely on the malar bone so Fig. 205 â€” Dissection of the ganglion (from 1. Superior maxillary nerve. 2. l'osi erior dental nerves. 3. Inner wall of orbit. 4.

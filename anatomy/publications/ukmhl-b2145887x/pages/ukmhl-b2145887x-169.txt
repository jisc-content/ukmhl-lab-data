79 THE WRIST JOINT. from the head of the metacarpal bone to the base of the phalanx, and closely connected with the transverse metacarpal ligament and the sheaths of the tendons. The Posterior ligament is a distinct structure beneath the expansion of the extensor tendons. The Lateral ligaments are strong bands which are attached to the sides of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and pass obliquely to the anterior margins of the phalanges. Each joint has a separate synovial membrane. The Phalangeal Articulations are similar to those between the metacarpus and phalanges. The articulations of the carpus and metacarpus may be remem- bered by the formulaâ€” E R 4 4 3 1 4 4 7 5 13 12 1 Thus the Scaphoid and Semilunar articulate each with 4 carpal bones and the Radius ; the Cuneiform with 3, and the Pisiform with 1 carpal bone each. The Trapezium and Trapezoides with 4, the Magnum with 7, and the Unciform with 5, carpal and metacarpal bones respectively. The numbers in the third row give the articu- lations of the several metacarpal bones with the carpus only, but in addition the adjacent bones of the four fingers articulate with each other.

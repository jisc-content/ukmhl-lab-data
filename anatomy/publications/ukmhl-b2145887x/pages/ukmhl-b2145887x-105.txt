THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 15 2. The acromio-thoracic (thoracica-humeraria; thoracic axis) (i) is a large branch arising from the artery at the upper border of the pectoralis minor, and immediately piercing the costo-coracoid mem- brane to divide into three branches. One (thoracic) runs forward to supply the pectoralis major, a second (acromial) backwards to the acromion process and shoulder, and the third (humeral) downwards Eig. 3.â€”The Axillary Artery and its Branches, the Pectoral Muscles being removed (drawn by Gr.

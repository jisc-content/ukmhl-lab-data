DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 232 similar incision prolonged to a length of about five inches (Fig. 117, b), or "by one of similar length placed so that its centre is opposite the anterior superior iliac spine. The steps of the proceeding are the same as those for tying the external iliac, but the operations are more arduous, owing to Fig. 117. the greater depth of the arteries and the conse- quent difficulty in reach- ing them. When the external iliac artery is tied, the circula- tion in the lower limb is carried on principally by the internal iliac, the branches of which (gluteal, sciatic, and obturator) anas- tomosefreelywith branches of the profunda femoris. In addition, the anasto- moses between the epigas- tric and the internal mam- mary branch of the sub- clavian, and between the circumflex iliac and the lumbar arteries, become greatly developed. If the internal iliac were tied, a return current would be established from the profunda femoris to the branches before mentioned, whilst the visceral branches would be supplied by free anastomoses from the vessels of the opposite side. When the common iliac is tied, the circulation in the limb depends mainly upon the internal mammary and epigastric, aided by blood brought circuitously from the opposite internal iliac to that of the same side, and thence to the profunda femoris. The middle sacral artery would also form a direct com- munication between the aorta and the lateral sacral branch of the internal iliac. The Kidney (Fig. 113, 14) may be roughly said to lie between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. It generally, however, reaches Fig. 117.â€”(From Fergusson's 'Practical Surgery.')

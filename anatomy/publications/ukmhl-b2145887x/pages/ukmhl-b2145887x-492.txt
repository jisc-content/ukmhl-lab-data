The remainder of the mucous membrane has columnar and ciliated cells, except at the anterior part corresponding to the cartilaginous portion of the nose, where the epithelium is squamous. The Olfactory Nerve (Fig. 210, a) is the special nerve of smell, and its branches, which are derived from the olfactory bulb, reach the nasal cavity by piercing the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The branches are distributed to the olfactory region, *.e., upon the superior and middle turbinate bones and the upper third of the septum, but are very difficult to follow, owing to their being destitute of the white substance of Schwann. The nerves of common sensation to the nose are derived trom Meckel's ganglion, and will be afterwards dissected. rWith a strong pair of scissors the turbinate bones may be readily cut, so as to expose the several openings into the three meatuses.] The Nasal Duct {ductus ad nasum) communicates between the lachrymal sac and the inferior meatus of the nose. It grooves the superior maxillary, lachrymal, and inferior turbinate bones, and consists of a fibrous tube lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium. . . â€ž The nasal branch of the fifth nerve (ophthalmic division) (Fig. 210, d) may be found in a groove on the under surface of the nasal bone m its passage from the orbit to the face, and gives a branch to the septum (pp. 320 and 356). Dissection of Meckel's Ganglion, etc. Before beginning this dissection, the student should ascertain the position of the sphenopalatine foramen (Fig. 209, e), opposite to which maxllary artery enters the nose. This will be found on either half of the skull immediately behind the superior meatus of the nose.

g4 PALM OF THE HAND. The Lumbricales (Fig. 25, 7) are four little muscles connected with the deep flexor tendons, and bear some resemblance to a worm (lumbricus). The first lumbricalis, counting from the radial side and sometimes the second), arms from the radial side of a single ndon ^t the others arise by distinct slips from the ^ of two deep tendons. The four muscles end m small tendon, which wind to the radial side of the four fingers, and, passing over the Tansve se Anient of the metacarpus, are inserted into the expansion rf Z e~ tendons on the back of the first phalanges. The lum- Wks act with the interossei as flexors of the first phalanges and e^oMe second and third phalanges. The first and second have been seen to be sullied by branches of the media,. nerve ; the third and fourth receive branches of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which will be seen in the deeper dissection. The Tendon of the Plexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 2o 9) is at th11 level as the tendons of the flexor -d can b traced between the halves of the flexor brevis pollicis to the base ot he tergal phalanx of the thumb. It lies in a fibrous sheath of^s own, but the synovial sheath communicates with the one beneath the annular ligament. [The tendons of the ^-J—^ & ^ ^ 6 C16 d. • ^| MOSCLES OP THE LITTLE FlEOEK.

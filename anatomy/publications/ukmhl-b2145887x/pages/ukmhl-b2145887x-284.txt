At this stage they may be seen giving off their lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the obliquus interims at once. Close above the crista ilii may be found the branches of the first lumbar nerve (16) (ilio-hypo- gastric and iHo-mguinal) running downwards to the pubes. The Transversalis Muscle (Fig. 99, 6) has its origin—I, from the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs, where it interdigitates with the diaphragm ; 2, by three aponeu- rotic slips «j*^to^<^«*»">»- abdominis muscle (from "Wilson).

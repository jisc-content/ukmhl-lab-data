THE INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 149 the digital vessels and nerves pass. It connects the heads of the metatarsal bones together and crosses the tendons of the interossei muscles. The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, viz. four dorsal and three plantar, the former being strictly between the bones, but Fig. 76. 13 It the latter lying rather on their under surfaces. The dorsal are penniform muscles and are readily seen ; the plantar are a little obscure, owing to the fibres of the dorsal interossei appearing bY their sides. Â° J The four dorsal interossei (Fig. 77) arise from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones in nearly the whole length of their shafts, and Fig 76. A section of the right leg in 1.

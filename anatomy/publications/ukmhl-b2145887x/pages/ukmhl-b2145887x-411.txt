THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. 321 along the outer side of the orbit to the lachrymal gland, which it supplies. 6. The Supra-orbital artery (n) ascends to join the frontal nerve and afterwards the supra-orbital nerve, which it accompanies through the supra-orbital notch to the forehead. c. Muscular branches (4) are given to all the muscles of the orbit, entering them on their ocular surfaces. Fig. 173. d. The Ciliary branches (6) are numerous small arteries which run by the side of the optic nerve to pierce the sclerotic, and have been divided into anterior and posterior. One of them pierces the optic nerve to run m it to the retina, and is called the arteria centralis retina, (3) T}\fhm°ulal arte™s, anterior (9) and posterior (7), pass through the ethmoidal foramina in the inner wall of the orbit, the anterior accompanying the nasal nerve. They supply meningeal twigs and branches to the nose, the anterior ending on the face. bP .tfSlttalP f«\ Series (14) leave the orbit at the inner side, to be distributed to the upper and lower eyelids.

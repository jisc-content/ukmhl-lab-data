Thus five divisions correspond to grooves on the radius and one to that R TJ on the ulna, and they may be remembered by the formula 2 2121: 1 (Fig. 24.) The dorsal interosseous muscles, four in number, can be most con- veniently dissected with those of the palm of the hand. Palm op the Hand. Surface-Marking. â€”The delicacy of the skin of the palm will depend very much upon the previous occupation of the individual, but in every case it will be found to present no hairs and to be ribbed by the rows of papillse, upon which the orifices of the sweat-ducts can be seen with a magnifying glass.

177 THE DEEP MUSCLES OF THE UKETHRA. median line ; the bulb should also be drawn over to the left side with hooks, so as to increase the space brought into view as much as possible.] Parts between the layers of the Triangular Ligament.— These are, the sub-pubic ligament and the deep muscles of the perinseum ; the membranous portion of the urethra ; Cowper's glands; portions of the puclic artery and nerve ; the artery to the bulb ; and the dorsal vein of the penis. Posterior to these is a process of the pelvic fascia, forming the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, and continuous with the capsule of the prostate. Deep Muscles.—Muscular fibres having a transverse direction but varying considerably in size and distinctness, will be seen on the removal of the anterior triangular ligament. These form the com- pressor urethrse, but the lower part, when very distinct, may be called the deep transverse muscle. The Compressor vel Con- strictor Urethrse (Fig. 90, 7) (Guthrie's muscle) arises from the posterior aspect of the ramus of the pubes, and divides into two slips, which run inwards trans- versely to enclose the membranous portion of the urethra, meeting the opposite muscle in a median raphe, and being expanded upon the whole length of this portion of the canal. Circular muscular fibres surround the membranous urethra beneath the compressor, but these are in- voluntary, and continuous with the muscular fibres of the prostate (Ellis). Behind the lower portion of this muscle near the middle line is situate one of Cowper's glands, and the muscle may conceal the artery to the bulb if it should arise lower than usual.

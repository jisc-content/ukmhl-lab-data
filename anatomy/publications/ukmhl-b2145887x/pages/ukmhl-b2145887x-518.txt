PAET V. THE THORAX. [Tlie arms having been previously removed, the dissectors of the thorax should detach the remains of the pectoral, serrati, and abdo- minal muscles from the outer surfaces of the ribs and their cartilages, and dissect the external intercostal muscles.] The External Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99,4) eleven in number, are placed between the ribs, being attached to the lower and upper borders of the adjacent bones, the fibres running obliquely downwards and forwards. The external intercostals extend from the tubercles of the ribs to their line of junction with the cartilages, beyond which point a thin fascia is prolonged to the sternum. Between the floating ribs the fibres cease at the extremities of the bones. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99, 5) take a direction opposite to that of the external muscles, and can now be seen partially near the sternum, where the external muscles are wanting, but are fully seen subsequently from within the thorax. TThe knife is to be carried through the cartilages of all the true ribs as near the bones as possible, and then along the intercostal space between the 5th and 6th ribs to the lower part of the sternum, lhe sternum being sawn across at this point can then be turned up, tlie â– pleurae beina divided near the median line so as to preserve the an- terior mediastinum, and the internal mammary vessels being neces- sarily cut across with the bone.] The Triangularis Sterni Muscle (Fig. 225, 3) lies at the back of the sternum, but is ordinarily damaged by the incision made for inject- ing the subject, and the muscle is therefore best seen on a fresh sternum from a post-mortem examination. It arises from the inner surface oi the ensiform cartilage and lower part of the sternum, and from the carti- lages of the last three or four true ribs ; and is inserted mto the carti- lages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs.

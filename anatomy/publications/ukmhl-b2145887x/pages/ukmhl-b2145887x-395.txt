The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 161, 4) should be traced to the upper opening of the carotid canal in the petrous bone. It makes a sigmoid turn by the side of the sella turcica, and then winds close behind the anterior clinoid process, where it was cut off in removing the brain. In a well-injected body, a few small branches (arterix receptaculi) may be seen in the cavernous sinus going to the dura mater; and the ophthalmic artery will be seen entering the optic foramen to the outer side of the optic nerve. Sympathetic Nerve.-A few filaments may be traced upon the carotid artery, forming the carotid plexus, which gives a branch of communication to the sixth nerve ; and the cavernous plexus may be lound close to the anterior clinoid process The Circular Sinus (Fig. 161, 6) surrounds the pituitary body in the sella turcica, and forms a communication between the two cavernous sinuses.

69 LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. into the radial side of the first phalanx of the middle finger ; the 3rd into the ulnar side of the same phalanx ; the 4th into the ulnar side of the first phalanx of the ring finger. These muscles vary slightly as to their attachments, but the following points respecting them have been elucidated by Duchenne's electrical investigations :—The insertion into the base of the first phalanx (Fig. 29), enables the interossei to act as flexors of that phalanx, whilst giving lateral move- Fig. 29. ment to the fingers to which they are attached. The slip (d)' sent forward to join the expansion of the extensor tendons extends the second and third phalanges ; and thus the action of the interossei is shown to include adduction to and abduction from the median line of the hand, with flexion of the first and extension of the second and third phalanges. [The interosseous muscles of the hand-should be compared with tnose oi the loot, when the same arrangement will be found to exist m both cases, with the exception that, in the foot, the imaginary line is drawn through the long or second toe, and that the muscles are . arranged in corresponding relation.] Ligaments op the Scapula. _ [The muscles about the scapula are to be followed to their exact insertions and cut short; the deltoid and the remains of the trapeziu must be carefully removed in order that the ligaments of the scapula and clavicle may be seen.] outpuid, The Acromioclavicular Articulation (Fig. 30) is a simple Fig. 29.—Attachment of an interosseous muscle (from Duchcnne). a.

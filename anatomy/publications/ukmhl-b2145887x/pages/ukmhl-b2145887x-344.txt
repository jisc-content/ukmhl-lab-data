VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 254 these the interlobular arteries arise, which pass between the sub- divisions of the cortical substance or pyramids of Ferrein and give off Fig. 138.

Each of these consists of a capillary plexus with an arterial twig (or afferent vessel) entering, and a venous radicle (or efferent vessel) leaving it, and these bodies are arranged along the arteries " Uke Fie 138 —Section of the kidney, surmounted by the suprarenal capsule (from 8' ' "Wilson). 5. 5, 5.

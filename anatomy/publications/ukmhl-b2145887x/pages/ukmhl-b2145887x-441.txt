The Levator Labii Superioris Proprius (Fig. 186, 9) arises from the superior maxilla and margin of the malar bone above the infra-orbital foramen, and is inserted into the npper lip externally to the slip from the common elevator. The Levator Anguli Oris (Fig. 186) arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla immediately below the infra- orbital foramen, and passes downwards and outwards be- neath the preceding muscle to the angle of the mouth, joining the fibres of the orbi- cularis. The Zygomaticus (Fig. 186) is either a single muscle, or has two slips forming the zygomaticus major and minor. The Zygomaticus major (11) arises from the malar bone close to its junction with the zygoma, and passes obliquely to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbi- cularis oris. Fie. 186.

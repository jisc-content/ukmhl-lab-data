516 THE EYEBALL. fleeted upon its surface, but can be readily stripped up as far as the margin of the cornea. The sclerotic overlaps the margin of the cornea as the case of a watch does the watch-glass, and encroaches upon it slightly above and below. The sclerotic and the cornea are inseparably united, the tissue of the two structures being continuous. By squeezing the eyeball between the finger and thumb the cornea Fig. 265. will be rendered white and opaque, but will resume its former appearance when the pressure is relaxed. The Cornea (Fig. 265, i) is one of the transparent media of the eye • and in man is perfectly circular when seen from within, but appears wider transversely from without, on account of the greater overlapping of the sclerotic above and below. The curvature of the cornea varies in different individuals, but the anterior and posterior surfaces are always parallel. The cornea is divisible into five layers : 1, anterior epithelium (conjunctiva) ; 2, anterior elastic lamina ; 3, cornea proper ; 4, posterior elastic lamina; 5, posterior epithelium (of aqueous humour). The cornea in health is a non-vascular structure, no blood-vessels existing m it and its Fig. 265.—Longitudinal section of the eye (drawn by H. Power). 7. Ciliary body and process. 8.

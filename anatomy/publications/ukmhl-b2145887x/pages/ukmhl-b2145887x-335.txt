THE ILEO-C^CAL VALVE. 245 inverted, the cut ends may be tied and the piece inflated and dried that the valve may be again examined in the dry condition.] The Ileo-ccecal valve (Fig. 128, 5) is formed by a prolongation of a piece of ileum through the wall of the caecum, to which it is firmly attached ; and being stretched from side to side, the small intestine Fig. 127. Fig. 128. forms two folds which project into the ca3cum and form the valve. The upper fold, which is horizontal in direction, is sometimes known as the ileo-colic, and the lower or more vertical one as the ileo-ccecal Fig. 127.—Section of the lower part of ileum of the calf, through a Peyer's gland (from Wilson, after Kolliker). 1.

LIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 74 attached to the upper margin of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, and to the edge of the olecranon process of the ulna. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 32, 2) is triangular, the apex being attached to the promi- Fig. 32.

The External Lateral Liga- ment (Fig. 33, 4) is a short thick band attached to the outer con- dyle, and radiating slightly at its attachment to the upper border of the orbicular ligament of the radius. The Synovial Membrane will be seen by removing the anterior ligament, and will be found to be reflected between the humerus, radius, and ulna, and also into the small joint between the head of the radius and the lesser sigmoid cavity. The articular surfaces of all the bones are encrusted with cartilage, but occasionally those of the coronoid and olecranon processes are separated by a groove aeross the bottom of tire sigmoid cavity. .

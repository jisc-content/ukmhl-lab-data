THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 313 [Supposing the dissection of the axilla to be sufficiently advanced, the clavicle should now be divided at the outer border of the sterno- mastoid and again at the edge of the trapezius. The knife being- then passed carefully beneath and close to the bone to detach the sub- clavius, the piece may be removed, but the parts will still be retained in position by the muscle. The suprascapular artery and vein will now also be better seen, and can be thoroughly cleaned. The sub- clavius muscle is to be divided close to the trapezius, when the scapula will fall back, and the brachial plexus will be fully exposed and should be carefully cleaned. The upper digitation of the serratus niagnus, which was mentioned as forming part of the floor of the triangle, can now be seen.] The Brachial Plexus (Fig. 167) is formed by the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical nerves and part of the 1st dorsal nerve, a small branch of communication being given by the lowest cord of the cervical plexus (4th). The nerves appear at the outer border of the Nerve to rhomboids Supra-scapular nerve Nerve to subclavius ..

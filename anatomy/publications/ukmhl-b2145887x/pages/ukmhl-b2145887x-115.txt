25 and inner heads of the triceps BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL ARTERY. The Branches of the "brachial artery are— 1. Muscular, arising at various points to supply the adjacent, muscles. 2. Nutritious, which enters the foramen on the inner side of the humerus about the middle of the hone, and has a general direction towards the elbow. 3. The Superior profunda which comes off from the inner side of the artery, just "below the teres major, and immediately joining the musculo-spiral nerve, accompanies it between the outer and, under cover of the long- head, round the humerus to the outer side. It now may he seen with the nerve between the bra- chialis anticus and supinator longus in front of the elbow, where it anastomoses with the radial recurrent artery. It gives off muscular branches (principally to the triceps), one long branch running to the anconeus and back of the elbow, which will be Fig. 8.—Deep dissection of the front of the upper arm (front'Hirschfeld and Leveille).

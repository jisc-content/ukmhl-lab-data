The branches to the small intestine form a series of priniary and secondary loops, which inoscnlate freely with one another and at last ramify in the submucous areolar tissue of the mtestine. The hrtrs to the large intestine take the f*J*^ names • thus the ileo-colic goes to the end of the oleum and com of the colon (—), the right coHc££ and the middle colic to the transverse colon. Each of these arteries dMdes into primary loops, which spread out on each side n iuosculate with one another and with the branches ^ the Bmal intestine ; and thus a free anastomosis is established from one part to another of the intestinal canal. .

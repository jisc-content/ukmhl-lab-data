208 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. It will be well for the student to notice the distinctive appearances of the several parts of the intestinal canal, and particularly the differences hetween the large and small intestines. The condition of the intestines will vary so much according to the mode of death, that mere size is no criterion, the small intestines heing occasionally distended to a much greater size than the large ; hut attention to the "g points will prevent all possibility of error The cylinder of the smaU intestine is uniform throughout, and the surface is perfectly smooth ; the large intestine on the contrary wi 1 be found to be pouched or slightly constricted at short intervals throughout except the rectum. Moreover it will be seen to be marked by distinct bands of longitudinal muscular fibres three m in most subjects small pieces of fat (appendices epiploic*) will be W attached along the free border. In the healthy condition the large intestine is about as large again as the small intestine The Peritoneum (Fig. 107).-The serous membrane covering the intestines is now to be traced, in doing which the student must bear " that he has already opened the cavity of the peri oneum, wMch was previously a shut sac. The best way to learn the pen- tonelTs to trace it as simply as possible at first, and afterwards to ^^^Z^, the membrane will be seen to hue the abdommal wall, and so to reach the diaphragm; from this it is SSSt the upper surface of the liver, round its and on the under surface of the,cganufr ^^f™ figure It then passes down to the stomacn, ioiumi0 favTof the gaL-hepaUc or lesser omentum, covers the anterior See of the stomach and is prolonged downwards over he intes- tines to form the anterior layer of the great omentum or,„loon.

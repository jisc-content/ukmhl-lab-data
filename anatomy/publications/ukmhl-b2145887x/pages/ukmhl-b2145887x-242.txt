The tendon of the popliteus and the external inferior articular artery have been traced beneath it. The short ligament, which is derived from the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is placed behind the long, and reaches from the condyle to the head of the fibula, but it is often very indistinct. . , The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 79, 5) « * broad band closely connected with the capsular ligament.

PART IV + DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. [The Student is requested to read the 'Introduction' before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.'] Before beginning the dissection the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of tbe part, and the relation of surface-markings to deeper structures. If he has already dissected this region, he should make the irxcisxons necessary for ex- posing the common carotid artery and the third part of the sub c avian artery, and may also advantageously perform the Wf^*^ gotomy and tracheotomy, and practise extraction of the teeth and ?he operation for plugging the posterior nares which last can be done with a flexible catheter. The surface of the scalp presen t . nothing worthy of note, but in a well-injected body the temporal artery will be prominent, and arteriotomy may be performed upon it. The superficial appearances on the face will be.describedmore particularly under that head, and reference may be made to that Â«prtion now if time allows. . In the neck, the median line is the boundary of the disseetoon, and mesents the following prominences and depressions, which thould be fully recognised with the finger. First of the lower iaw, next a depression corresponding to the mylo-hyoid mn^e Mowed by the projection of the hyoid which can he felt distinctly on each side in some subjects J.fie lepression corresponding to the thyro-hyoid prominent powum Adami of the thyroid cartilage are next- fV*^ which are the interval of the crico-thyroid memtaneand the rm of the cricoid cartilage. Below this may <~^^ to isthmus of the thyroid gland or body, and even the subject; and on each side there is (particularly m women) the sli0fit projection of the thyroid gland.

FEMORAL HERNIA. 88 licrament. Three vertical incisions, one in the centre and one at each side of the tubular sheath, will enable the dissector to see that it is di- vided by two slender septa into three compartments, the femoral artery occupying the outermost, the Fig. 40. 1 f j —o femoral vein the middle, and the innermost or smallest one being occupied only by a lym- phatic gland. This last divi- sion of the femoral sheath is the femoral or crural canal. The Femoral or Crural Ring- (Fig. 41, 12).—If the finger be passed upwards along the crural canal it will enter the Crural or Femoral Ring beneath Poupart's ligament, displacing a lymphatic gland and a little piece of subperi- toneal fat, which occupy it and form the septum crurale. The boundaries of the crural ring can be better felt than seen, and are, in front, Pou- part's ligament, or crural arch (with occasionally a distinct band of fascia transversalis bene** it, called the ^seplS the and body of the pubes ; externally, ^JT^qZ,^ ligament, septum ; ami internally, tbe sbarp »^™°lal hem° kaves olt; tbe Anger sbould ^^g^ an incb • T KSSSfflSS t* tbe Ual nag to m length, along which lemora forced its way the saphenous opening ; but asoon „^ attachment of the through that spot, it ascends, owing to tne cu* _ Kg. .O.-Crura! sheath laid open (from Wood a.

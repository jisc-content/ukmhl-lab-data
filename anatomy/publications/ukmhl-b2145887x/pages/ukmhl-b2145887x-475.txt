385 THE SPINAL-ACCESSORY NERVE. other, is the communicating branch from the first and second cervical nerves (Fig. 204, 19). The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 203, 8) commences outside the skull by.the junction of the lateral sinus with the inferior petrosal sinus. Its course in the neck has been already seen, and it should now be divided close to the skull and removed. The Spinal-accessory Nerve (Fig. 203, 6) emerges from the .Fig. 203. foramen jugulare, where it is closely connected with the pneumo-- gastric nerve, and may be traced to the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid muscle (Fig.. 204. 4).

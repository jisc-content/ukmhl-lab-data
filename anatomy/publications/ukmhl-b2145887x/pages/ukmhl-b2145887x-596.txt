INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 506 veins (Vence Galeni), which open into the straight sinus of the dura mater (Fig. 263, 3). The Great Transverse Fissure, or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 253, 11) which is now opened, is the slit by which the pia mater enters Fiff. 259 the brain. It is opposite the interval between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and reaches forward in the brain beneath the fornix and corpus caHosum, and above the great ganglia of the brain (corpora striata and optic thalami). The fissure is continued downward on each side in the descending comu of the lateral ventricle, and reaches the base of the brain at the outer side of each cms cerebri. [The velum interpositurn is to be reflected, when the two small choroid plexuses of the third ventricle will be seen on its under surface. The third ventricle will now be seen, and behind it the corpora Fi°\ 259.—The velum interpositurn, showing its continuity with the pia mater (from University College Museum). 1 Fornix divided. 7.

243 INTESTINAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE. the mucous membrane, which give it a velvety appearance, and may be best seen by floating a piece of intestine in water. Each villus is a prolongation of the mucous membrane, formed of lymphoid tissue and covered with columnar epithelium. It contains in its centre a single or double lacteal, surrounded by a delicate layer of involuntary muscle prolonged from the muscularis mucosae; external to which is a capillary plexus, with the basement-membrane on which the epithe- lium rests (Fig. 123). The capillary plexus is supplied by a small artery passing up one side of the villus, and ends in a vein running down the opposite side (Fig. 124). Lieberkiihn's follicles (Fig. 127, 2) are minute tubes, which are placed between the villi, and resemble the mucous glands of the stomach ; they dip into the submucous areolar tissue, and are lined with columnar epithelium. Solitary glands, or lymphoid follicles (Fig. 126) are minute white Fig. ,125. Fis. 126. round bodies, consisting of closed vesicles containing milky fluid and covered with villi. Brunner's ajlands (Fig. 125), peculiar to the upper part of the duo- denum, are small lobulated glands situated in the submucous areolar tissue and having small ducts which open into the intestine. To see these it is necessary to pin out a piece of duodenum with the mucous Fig. 125.—Vertical section of mucous membraneof duodenum, showing BrumWa glands (from Wilson, after Ecker). a.

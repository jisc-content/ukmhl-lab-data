THE TYMPANUM. 406 foramen to the foramen ovale. By this cut the cavity of the tympanum will be divided, and it will be possible to examine its walls and ossicula, together with the seventh nerve and the chorda tympani.] The Tympanum or Middle Ear (Fig. 212) is an irregular six- sided cavity, which may be conveniently said to resemble a room, with a passage (meatus auditorius externus) leading to it. The outer wall of the chamber is formed by the membrana tympani, which is placed obliquely Fig. 212. at the end of the meatus, and consists of three layers, epithelial, fibrous, and mucous ; the inner wall corresponds to the outer wall of the vesti- bule and cochlea, parts of the internal ear; in front, is the opening of the Eustachian tube, with the special tube for the tensor tympani muscle formed by the processus cochleari- formis ; behind, is the opening into the mastoid cells. The roof of the chamber is a thin portion of bone separating it from the cavity of the cranium ; the floor is a thicker portion corresponding to the jugular fossa. following The inner wall is the most important, and presents the Mowmg points for examination (Fig. 208): (1) the fenestra ovate m winch the base of the stapes articulates ; below this (2) the fenestra rotunda^ opening into the cochlea closed by a membrane, the secondary mm- riff 212.-Int.emal view of the Otic ganglion and Tympanum (from Â°' " Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

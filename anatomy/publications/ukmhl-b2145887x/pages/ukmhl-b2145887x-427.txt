THE INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. 337 Fig. 178. left side, and may be considered to be a branch of the first part of the subclavian. 1. The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 178, 5) is seen now in only a small part of its course. It ascends between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles, being crossed by the inferior thyroid artery and on the left side, by the thoracic duct; and enters the foramen m the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra (usually), beino- accompanied by a branch from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The artery passes through the transverse processes of all the upper cervical vertebrae, giving off muscular and spinal branches m its course, and is seen, in the suboccipital region to wind inwards upon the atlas and enter the foramen magnum, to supply the brain. The Vertebral vein has no course in the skull, but commences in small branches about the atlas. It takes the same course as the artery, receiving corresponding branches and also the ascending cervical and deep cervical veins, and after cross- ing the subclavian artery, opens into the termination of the subclavian vein. It often passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. 2. The Internal Mammary- Artery (Fig. 178, 4) arises from the lower surface of the subclavian artery, and at once descends into ZL â„¢ 1 Cr0SSed suPerficiaU7 an<* obliquely by the phrenic nerve, ine left artery has been seen to pass through the anterior medxastmum, but the right is excluded by the pleufa, which binds it to the costal cartilages. Both arteries pass between the triangularis term muscle and the costal cartilages, and divide opposite the seventh costal cartilage into two terminal branches-superior eZ gastric and musculo-phrenic.

83 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. of Poupart's ligament. In such a case, if the hernial protrusion be returned, the finger can he readily passed into the enlarged saphenous opening and up into the crural ring behind Poupart's ligament. The crest and anterior superior spine of the ilium will be readily seen and felt, the anterior inferior spine less so, on account of the muscles covering it; the spine and crest of the • pubes can also be distinguished. The great trochanter is easily recognised from three • to four inches below the crest of the ilium, and should be thoroughly i manipulated that its relation to the upper border of the pelvis and surrounding parts may be clearly appreciated during the movements of the limb • and the. two sides of the body should be compared if i any morbid change about the hip is suspected. An important diagnostic sign of a healthy condition of the neck of the femur is, that when the limb is rotated the trochanter describes part of the arc of a circle, which is not the case when fracture exists. When an impacted fracture or absorption of the neck of the femur has taken place, the arc is much smaller and the movement less complete. The head of the femur may be felt behind the trochanter when the limb is rotated, and in a very thin subject it may be detected in front, when the finger is thrust deeply into Scarpa's triangle. Fig. 38. Nekton's test line for dislocation of the head of the femur upwards hr backwards is one drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to :he tuberosity of the ischium (Fig. 38, a b), which in health touches |:he toP of the great trochanter.

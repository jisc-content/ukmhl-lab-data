EXTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 496 verse and longitudinal fibres may be seen. These are in alternate layers, the transverse being continuous with the crura cerebelli, and the longitudinal with the fibres of the cord and the crura cerebri. On slicing one of the crura cerebri deeply, a mass of grey matter (locus niger) will be found.] The Exterior of the Brain. [The brain being placed with the base downwards, the pia mater is to be removed from the upper surface of the cerebrum.] The Upper Surface of the Brain (Figs. 254 and 255) is divided into two symmetrical halves, or hemispheres, by the loiigitudinal Fig. 254.

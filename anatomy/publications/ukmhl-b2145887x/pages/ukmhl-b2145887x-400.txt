310 POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. overlain by the levator anguli scapula.. In some subjects, where the aP x oTthe triangle is wider than usual, a portion of the complexus may be seen and will he recognised by the vertical directum of its fibTes Not nnfrcqueutly, if the attachment of the sterno-mastoid Tthe clavicle is not well developed, both the anterior scalenus and the nhrenic nerve lying on it are seen in the posterior triangle. Tht teangleTs subdivided into two portions by the posterior beUy of he omo-hyoid muscle, the height of which above the clavicle may vary the contents of each subdivision being modified accordingly TheLper or occipital por(to» contains the branches of the super- ficial cervical plexus derived from the first four accessory nerve (which may be traced into the trapezius, Sre iTcomZmicates with branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical ner^s) muscular branches of the cervical plexus; the transverse 3 vein; and the glcmM* cmcatemt* or lymphatic glands ulaced along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The C?or cilicatar portioa contains the brachial plexus and its supraclaXular branches ; the third part of the subclavian arterj; the transverse cervical artery; the suprascapular vessels ; and the external jugular vein, all of which must now be dissected.

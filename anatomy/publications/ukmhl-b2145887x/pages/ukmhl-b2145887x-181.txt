SCARPA'S TRIANGLE. 91 The Crural branch of the Genito-crural nerve pierces the fascia half an inch below Poupart's ligament and just outside the femoral artery, and joins the middle cutaneous nerve. It is very seldom satisfactorily seen unless traced from the lumbar plexus. Fig. 43. The External cutaneous nerve (3) is to be found in a fold of fascia lata close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and pierces the fascia at a variable point, to be distributed by an anterior and a pos- terior branch to the outer side of the thigh and part of the buttock. The Middle Cutaneous nerve (5) (from the anterior crural,) pierces the fascia in the upper third of the. thigh, and will be afterwards- traced as far as the knee. The Internal cutaneous and Long Saphenous nerves are not seen at present. Scarpa's Triangle. [The fascia lata is to be removed from the hollow below Poupart's ligament as far as the skin has been reflected, and the muscles, ' vessels and nerves thus exposed, are to be as thoroughly cleaned as is possible without disturbing their relations.] Scarpa's triangle is the space in the upper third of the front of the I thigh, containing the first part of the femoral vessels. The base of the triangle is upwards, and is formed by Poupart's ligament j the outer border is formed by the sartorius muscle, which crosses the , thigh obliquely ; the inner border corresponds to the inner margin of Fi • 43.—Irregular origin of obturator artery from epigastric. 1st variety (1 in 4) external to crural ring (from Wood ' On Rupture').

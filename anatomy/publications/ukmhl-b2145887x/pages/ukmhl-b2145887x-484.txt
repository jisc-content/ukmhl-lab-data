394 THE PALATE. it is lubricated by a minute bursa, and then takes a horizontal direc- tion to the soft palate. It is inserted into the palate by an expansion beneath the levator, and also into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the palate bone. Fig. 207. The levator palati raises the soft palate, and the circuniflexus makes- it tense on each occasion of swallowing. The azygos uvula, can have but a slight and unimportant action, viz., that of shortening the uvula. The levator palati and azygos uvulae are supplied by palatine branches from the sphenopalatine (Meckel's) ganglion; the tensor palati receives a branch from the otic ganglion. m Sureerv -The muscles above the palate, and especially the levatoi palati, are of interest surgically in relation to the operation of staphyloraphy, or that for closure of a congenital fissure of the Fig. 207—Muscles of the palute Q 1.

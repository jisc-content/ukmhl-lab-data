INGUINAL HERNIA. 197 the transversalis muscle, and the interval between that muscle and the internal oblique.. Inguinal Hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. Oblique passes through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal, and out of the external ring. Direct breaks through or pushes before \ Fig. 101. Fascia transversali Conjoined tendon.

The coverings of each hernia will be best seen by tracing them from within outwards ■ thus oblique hernia would have (1) peri- toneal sac ; (2) in coining through the internal ring it would have the fascia transversalis, or infundibular fascia ; (3) in passing beneath the internal oblique it would have the cremaster muscle, the fibres of which are muted by cellular tissue and are sometimes known as the cremasteric fascia ; in emerging from the external ring it would have (4) the mtercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial iascia and skin. Direct hernia would have, (1) the peritoneum, and (2) the fascia transversalis, (for both line the abdomen) ; then pushing into the inguinal canal it would have a covering (3) from the conjoined tendon ; and lastly emerging from the external ring, it would have (4) the mtercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial Fig. lOl.-Diagram of the inguinal canal, showing its anterior and ™ * • boundaries (drawn by J.

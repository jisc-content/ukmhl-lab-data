PAET VII DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Before dissecting the Membranes or Vessels of the Brain It will he well to recognise the several parts of the Encephalon, as this will assist the student in following the description. The upper part of the brain is formed by the Cerebrum or great brain which is divided into two symmetrical halves by a median longitudinal fissure. The under surface or base of the brain is much more complicated than the upper surface, and will be subsequently examined more particularly. At the posterior part will be seen the Cerebellum or smaller brain, which consists of two symmetrical halves like the great brain; these are united by a convex white body, the Pons Varolii, at the lower border of which is the. upper part of the spinal cord or Medulla Oblongata. These parts will be readily recognised by referring to Fig. 253. TThe brain is to be placed in a plate with the base upward for the examination of the membranes and the dissection of the vessels.J The Membranes of the Brain are the Dura Mater, the Arachnoid, and the Pia Mater. m , . The Dura Mater has been already seen lining the skull and giving off processes for the support of the brain (p. 299). The Arachnoid is a serous membrane which has been seen to consist of two layers â€”parietal, which lines the dura mater, and visceral, which is now to be examined. The Visceral layer is more or less united with the subjacent pia mater but differs from it in passing from one convolution to another without dipping into the sulci. It passes into the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres of the cerebrum, but does not quite reach the corpus callosum, and may be conveniently traced from the anterior termination of this over the base of the cerebrum, (the lobes of which it binds together) to the cerebellum and medulla oblongata,

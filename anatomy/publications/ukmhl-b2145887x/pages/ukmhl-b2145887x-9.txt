PBEFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION â™¦ In preparing a new edition of Practical Anatomy, I have had the advantage of submitting its pages to my friend and colleague, Mr. Eickman Godlee, who has care- fully revised it throughout. In deference to suggestions from Professor Thane and Dr. Carrington I have added a deep dissection of the neck from the side, and have made the dissection of the thorax a separate section. The number of coloured plates from Maclise's " Surgical Anatomy " has been increased to twenty-four, and a few new woodcuts have been added. 36, Cavendish Square, September, 1881. CHRISTOPHER HEATH.

The convoluted tubes are lined with similar flattened epithelium, but the looped tubes, as they increase in diameter, are filled with granular epi- thelium. The large collect- ing tubes have a distinct columnar epithelium (Fig. 141). Between the straight tu- buli of the medullary por- tion are numerous straight arteries, which are recur- rent branches from the arches between the cortical and medullary substances, and these are joined by the straight efferent vessels of some of the deeper glome- ruli. The renal artery also supplies the fibrous cap- sule of the kidney with branches, which anasto- mose with the lumbar arteries from the aorta.

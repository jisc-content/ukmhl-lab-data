478 THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The Semispinalis (Fig. 246) is divided into the semispinals colli and semispinalis dorsi. Semispinalis colli (11) arises from the transverse processes of the six upper dorsal vertebras and the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebras, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical ver- tebras from the 2nd to the 5th inclusive. Semispinalis dorsi (io) arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras from the sixth to the tenth inclusive, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the last two cervical and upper four dorsal vertebras. Spinal Nerves (Fig. 248).—The Posterior Divisions of all the spinal nerves (with the exception of the first cervical and fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal) divide into internal and external branches, which supply all the muscles of the back. The Internal branches of all the cervical nerves (except the first) and of the upper six dorsal nerves become cutaneous near the spinous processes. The External branches of the lower six dorsal and of all the lumbar nerves, become cuta- neous at an oblique line corresponding to the margin of the aponeurosis of the la- tissimus dorsi. The External branches of the upper sacral nerves become cutaneous near the median line. The fourth and fifth sacral nerves are very small and join with the coc- cygeal nerve.

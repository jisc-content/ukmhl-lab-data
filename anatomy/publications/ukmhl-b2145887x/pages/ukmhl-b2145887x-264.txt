174 THE MALE PERINJSUM. muscles dissected out. The accelerator urinse is in the median line, the erector penis parallel to the ramus of the puces and the trans- versa perinsei crosses between them posteriorly ; the muscles thus bounding a triangular space in which a part of the triangular liga- ment is seen.] Superficial Muscles of the Perinseum. The Accelerator Urinse (Fig. 88, 8) (ejaculator seminis or hulbo- cavernosus) is a single muscle, composed of two symmetrical halves united in the middle line by a delicate fibrous raphe. The fibres arise from the central point of the perineum and from the fibrous raphe in the middle line, and are thus inserted .--the posterior fibres which are nearly transverse in their direction, overlie the bulb and are lost upon the triangular ligament; the middle fibres enclose the urethra and corpus spongiosum ; and the anterior fibres enclose the entire penis, including the dorsal vessels. The Erector Penis (Fig. 88, io) covers the crus penis on the ramus of the os pubis. It arises from the anterior and inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, and also from the ramus of the ischium, and ends in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides of the crus penis. . . , The Transversa Perinsei (Fig. 88, 14) varies m size, and may be divided into two slips. It arises from the inner side of the ramus of the ischium, and meets its fellow muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perinseum, where it is also blended with the fibres of the accelerator urinse and sphincter ani. The action of the accelerator is to expel the contents of the urethra by its sudden and spasmodic contraction. It is not put in action during the greater part of the act of micturition ; but when the flow of urine has ceased, it serves to eject the small remaining portion or mav be used to arrest the flow of urine suddenly, when its action dves rise to considerable pain. Its action during coition is expressed bv the name ejaculator seminis, and its anterior fibres assist materi- ally in producing erection of the penis by compressing the dorsal The erector penis assists somewhat in the production of vein. erection, by compressing the corpus cavernosum.

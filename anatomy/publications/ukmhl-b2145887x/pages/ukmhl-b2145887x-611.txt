521 THE RETINA. and nuclei developed in it. 2. The ganglionic layer consisting of nerve cells of spheroidal or pyriform shape. 3. The inner molecular layer. 4. The inner nuclear layer consisting of transparent nucleus-like bodies. 5. The outer molecular layer much thinner than the inner one. 6. The outer nuclear layer. b. The membrana limitans exter- na. 7. The outer layer on Jacob's membrane consists of a peculiar arrangement of particles to which the names rods and cones Fig. 268. Fig. 269. have been given. These rods are continuous with some fibres which pierce the whole depth of the retina, and are called the fibres of Muller. 8. The pig- mentary layer consisting of hex- agonal pigment cells, which were formerly considered to belong to „ the choroid coat (Fig. 268). A needle passed from before backwards through the axis of the eye, would pierce the following structures :—1. Cornea Anterior chamber filled with aqueous humour, terior chamber. 5. Anterior capsule of lens. 6. 2. 3. Pupil. 4. Pos- Lens. 7. Posterior 1. The surface. Fig. 268.—Pigmentary layer of the retina. 2. Cells seen edgeways. Fig. 269.—The Retina (from Schultze). 3.

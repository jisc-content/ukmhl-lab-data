THE INFERIOR HEMORRHOIDAL ARTERY. 171 and to the pelvic fascia between those points. It is now seen at its insertion into the central line of the perinseum, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side both in front of and behind the rectum ; it is inserted also into the side of the rectum, and into the anterior surface of the extremity of the coccyx with the opposite muscle. The levator ani supports the pelvic viscera, and, when in contrac- tion, tends to prevent the expulsion of their contents. It may also be considered as an extraordinary muscle of expiration, since it acts upon the viscera in opposition to the diaphragm. It is supplied by the fourth sacral nerve. The Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Artery (Fig. 88, 13) arises from the pudic artery under cover of the ischium, and takes a nearly transverse Fig. 88.â€”Superficial dissection of r 1.

THIJ CAPSULAR LIGAMENT. 121 ment is put on the stretch, in adduction of the limb, and being thin, is always torn in dislocation of the head of the femur backwards. The anterior part is put on the stretch in abduction of the thigh, and the ilio-femoral band serves to prevent the head starting from the cotyloid cavity, hence the rarity of dislocation forwards. The capsular ligament having been divided, the thigh will be seen to be held by the so-called ligamentum teres, which will be brought into view by abducting and everting the limb. In doing this a squeaking noise will probably be heard, which is clue to the sudden separation of the moist articular surfaces of the femur and pelvis, Fig. 58. which are covered with cartilage. The inter-articular ligament (teres) being divided, the limb can be removed. The single synovial membrane of the joint will be seen to be reflected over the mner surface of the capsular ligament on to the neck of the femur, and to be prolonged over the ligamentum teres to the bottom of the acetabulum, which it lines. In the bottom of the cavity it is Fig. 58.—Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint (from Wilson) 1. Oblique sacro-iliac ligament. 6. Cotyloid ligament. 2. Great sacro-sciatic ligament. 7.

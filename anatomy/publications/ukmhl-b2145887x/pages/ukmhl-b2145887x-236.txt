146 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. tarsal bone of the great toe, opposite which it divides.into the com- municating branch to the sole of the foot and the: dorsal ^artery of the great toe. Its direction is from the centre of the instep to the first interosseous space, and it lies at first superficially between the tendons of the extensor proprius pol- licis and the extensor longus digitorum, but is crossed near the point of bifurca- tion by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The artery lies upon the bones of the tarsus and their dorsal ligaments, and has the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. Two vence comites accompany the vessel. Surgery (Fig. 74). The dorsal artery may be tied in the upper part of its course by an incision on the outer side of, but parallel to, the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis. It occasion- ally happens, however, that the artery is displaced to the middle of the foot beneath the tendons of the extensor digitorum.

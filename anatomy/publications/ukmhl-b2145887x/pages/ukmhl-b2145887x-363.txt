273 THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS. narrow space of cellular tissue, are the two coccygei muscles ; and posterior to these the two smaller sacro-sciatic ligaments, which bound the great sacro-sciatic foramen. This foramen is closed by the pyri- formis muscle, above and below which vessels and nerves leave the pelvis. The Levator Ani Muscle (Fig. 151, 23) takes its origin from the back of the pubes, and from the front of the spine of the ischium ; between those points its fibres are usually attached to the white line marking the division of the pelvic fascia, and seen on the dissection of the fascia from without (Fig. 144), but occasionally the fibres arise irom the pelvic fascia an inch above the white line, the obturator fascia being then a separate structure (p. 261). The anterior fibres pass beneath the bladder and prostate to unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe of the perhiEeum, the name levator prostate being sometimes given to those fibres which pass beneath the prostate [m the female they are connected with the vagina] ; the middle fibres are inserted into the rectum and blend with the sphinc- ter ; and the posterior fibres unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe behind the anus, and are attached to the apex of the coccyx. It is supplied by branches from the 4th sacral nerve and by a branch from the anterior perineal nerve ' The Ooccygeus (Fig. 151, 34) is the little triangle of pale muscular fibres having its insertion into the side of the coccyx and its ongm (the apex of the triangle) from the spine of the W^Tlf^1^ ^ attacWt 0f the levator ani from which the muscle is separated by a narrow cellular interval sctticC llCygeUS, 18 Connected with the lesser sacro- ciatic 1 gament, which passes from the sacrum to the spine of * ^ ^ * a ^ ^ 4th aPnd The Obturator Internus Muscle (Tier 1*1 rn\ i 1 i strrwpfl nn -i , ■™-Ubl'ie V-^g- ±51, 19) has been de- the f_ M fM as ^L^Z^^ ^ a tendon, which passes out nf i . es eucl 111 deep surface hemg subdivided into lour or five sma 1 1, ' 8 winds „vcr the edge of the sacro-sciatic notch, wHchTi™,A°™ as * cartdage and lubricated bv a bursa.

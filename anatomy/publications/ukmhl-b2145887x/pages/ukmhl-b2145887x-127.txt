FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 37 afterwards supplies the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, brachialis anticus (in part), and the anconeus ; and the branch to the last muscle with an accompanying artery should be at once traced through the fibres of the triceps at the back of the external condyle. The Superior Profunda branch of the brachial artery closely accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve around the bone, and supplies the triceps in its course. At the outer edge of the triceps it gives ■off a large superficial branch which runs clown to the elbow; it then divides into two branches, one going to the back of the elbow beneath the triceps to anastomose with the interosseous recurrent and inferior profunda arteries; the other running between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to anastomose with the radial recurrent artery. The Front op the Fore-arm. [One incision is to be made down the middle of the fore-arm, and another at right angles to it across the front of the wrist, and the flaps of skin are to be turned to each side.] The Cutaneous "Veins (Fig. 13) will be found in the superficial fascia, and can be defined without injury to the nerves. The Anterior Ulnar Vein (10) is pretty regular in its course, and will be found to commence in one or two small branches about the wrist ; then running along the inner side of the fore-arm, it joins the Posterior Ulnar Vein (8) near the elbow and assists in forming the basilic vein. The Median Vein (9) is seldom in the centre of the arm at first, but commences near the root of the thumb, coursing obliquely to the centre of the arm near the bend of the elbow, where it is joined by the profunda vein and divides into median basilic and median ■cephalic branches (p. 21). The Radial Vein (7) commences at the back of the hand, and appears on the outer side of the fore-arm about its middle. It has been seen to unite with the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein (p. 21). Besides these named veins there are numerous smaller branches which assist, and occasionally take the place of, the larger ones. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 13) are now to be followed out. The Internal cutaneous nerve (4) can be traced to the whole of the inner side of the fore-arm, the branches winding round to the back of the limb. It sometimes forms a junction with— A cutaneous branch of the Ulnar nerve (12), which may, with care be found piercing the fascia about a hand's breadth above the wrist

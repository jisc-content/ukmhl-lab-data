MUSCLES OF THE THUMB. 65 It must be divided to see the following :— Muscles of the Thumb. The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 25, 2) is a slender muscle, and is the most superficial of the series. It arises from the ridge on the trapezium, and from the annular ligament. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, with the outer half of the flexor brevis The Opponens Pollicis (Fig. 25, 3) arises from, the front of the Fig. 25. trapezium and from the annular ligament, and is inserted into the outer border of the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its action is to "oppose" the thumb to the fingers, an action peculiar to man and monke}Ts, the muscle being sometimes called the flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis. The Plexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 25, 4) consists of two por- tions at its insertion, between which the tendon of the Ions flexor is placed, one head being more or less conjoined with the adductor, and the other with the abductor pollicis. It arises from the lower part of the annular ligament, from the front of the trapezium, trapezoides and os magnum, the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis. The two heads are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and into the sesamoid bones which are developed at this Fig. 25.—Muscles of 1. Annular ligament. 2,2.

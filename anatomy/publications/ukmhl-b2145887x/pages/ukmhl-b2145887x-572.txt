THE SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 482 Fig. 251. nerves. It is formed by a series of twenty-one or two serrations, connected witli the pia mater and with the inner surface of the dura mater midway between the apertures of exit for the nerves. It serves to sling the cord and secure it from shocks. The Anterior Spinal Artery and the two Posterior Spinal Arteries may be traced upon the cord if well-injected. They are branches of the vertebral arteries, the anterior being formed by the junction of a branch from each side. The arteries ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with the spinal branches which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral fora- mina. The Veins of the cord pass through the intervertebral foramina to join the vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar veins. The Spinal Cord (Figs. 250, 251) extends from the termination of the medulla oblongata at the level of the upper border of the atlas, to the first lumbar vertebra. It is cylin- drical in shape, but presents two flattened enlargements, one the bra- chial, which extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and the lower or lumbar enlarge- ment near the lower extremity of the cord.

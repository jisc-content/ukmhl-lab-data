Meckel's ganglion. 403 The Spheno-palatine, or Meckel's Ganglion (Fig. 211, i) is a minute red body situated opposite the spheno-palatine foramen, which is connected with the superior maxillary nerve by one or two branches (p. 398); with the facial nerve by the Vidian nerve ; and with the sympathetic upon the internal carotid artery by a branch which joins the Vidian nerve (Fig. 208). Fig. 211. 10 The Branches (Fig. 211) of the ganglion are ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. 1. The ascending branches are two or three of very small size, which pass to the periosteum of the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure. 2. The descending branches go to the palate, and are three in number:— Fig. 211.—Meckel's ganglion and its branches (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

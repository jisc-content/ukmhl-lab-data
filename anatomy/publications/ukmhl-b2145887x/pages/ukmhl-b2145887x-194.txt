The deep division pierces the obturator externus and lies on the adductor magnus both of which it supplies, and gives an articular branch through the adductor macmus to the back of the knee, which affords one explanation of the pain referred to the knee in disease of the hip-joint _ An Accessory obturator nerve is occasionally found passing from the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus over the pub*> beneath the pectineus. When this exists it more or less replaces the super- ficial division of the obturator nerve. , The Adductor Magnus (Fig. 49, 26) anses from the lower part of the descending ramus of the pubes ; from the ascendmg ramus ol the ischium ; and from the lower part of the tuberosity.

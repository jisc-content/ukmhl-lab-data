The Sublingual is) generally of good size, comes off at the anterior margin of the hyo-glossus, and is directed to the chin across Fig. 200. the genio-hyo-glossus, which muscle it supplies, together with the sublingual gland. 4 The Ranine (2) is the termination of the lingual artery and after leaving the genio-hyo-glossus enters the under surface of the tongue, to be continued in its substance to the tip, where it anasto- moses with the vessel of the opposite side. Surgery —The lingual artery can be most conveniently tied 111 the triable formed by the two bellies of the digastric and the hypo- crlossal nerve, by dividing the fibres, of the hyo-glossus horizontally near the hyoid bone. A curved incision from the symphysis menti to near the angle of the jaw, reaching to the level of .the hyoid bone will expose the lower border of the submaxillary gland, which must be drawn upwards so as to expose the digastric muscle.

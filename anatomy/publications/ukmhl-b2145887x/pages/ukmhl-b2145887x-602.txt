[The brain being again placed with the base downward, an incision is to be made through the valve of Vieussens and the cerebellum, in order to expose fully the cavity of the/ourth ventricle.] The Fourth. Ventricle (Fig. 261, 6) is situated at the back of the pons Varolii and the medulla oblongata, those bodies forming its floor. The roof is formed by the valve of Vieussens and the inferior vermi- Fijv. 262. form process of the cerebellum ■ the sides by the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum (processus ad testes) above, and below by the restiform body. The cavity of the ventricle is lozenge-shaped, and it communicates above with the third ventricle by the Aqueduct of Sylvius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum), which passes beneath the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263, 16). Below, the fourth ventricle is closed by a reflection of pia mater, in which there is usually an opening establishing a communication between the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. Connected with this process of pia mater is the Choroid "plexus of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 262, 3), which extends for some distance into the cavity.

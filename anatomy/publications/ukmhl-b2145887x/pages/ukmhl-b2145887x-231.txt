141 THE FASCIA OF THE LEG. foot ending in the internal and external saphena veins on opposite sides. The internal saphena vein is to "be traced in front of the internal malleolus to the inner side of the knee. Cutaneous Nerves.—On the outer side of the leg are a few cutaneous branches from the external popliteal nerve. The Musculocutaneous Nerve (Fig. 75, 13) pierces the deep fascia about the lower third of the outer side of the leg, and at once divides into two branches, which however often appear at different points. The internal division (15) gives branches to the inner side of the great toe, the outer side of the second, and the inner side of the third toe ; frequently also giving a small branch to join the anterior tibial nerve between the first and second toes. The outer division (17) supplies the outer side of the third toe, both sides of the fourth, and either one or both sides of the fifth toe. The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 75, 21) winds round the external malleolus from the back of the leg, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; or occasionally to both sides of the little toe and half the next, joining the musculo-cutaneous nerve The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 75, 16) appears in the interval between the great and the second toes, the adjacent sides of which it supplies, often joining with a branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Internal Saphenous Nerve lies in front of the internal malleolus with the saphena vein, which it accompanies. It may be traced along the inner side of the foot, bat is of small size The Fascia of the leg is dense and white, and is attached to the tibia on the inner side and to the fibula on the outer side, forming an intermuscular septum between the extensor and the peroneal irtr I grs, f?n *° muscuiar fiires at ^ ^ of the leg where it should therefore be allowed to remain undisturbed ■ the m farrhOTld be rem0TCd> ««Pt a thickened hand over he ankle joint the anterior annular ligament.

497 UPPER SURFACE OF THE BRAIN. fissure, in which will be found the branches of the anterior cerebral artery. By separating the hemispheres, the white corpus callosmn will be seen at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure. The surface of the brain is marked by convolutions, the intervals between which are called sulci, and these have recently acquired sufficient impor- tance to require individual notice, although the arrangement of the convolutions is not precisely the same in any two brains, or even on both sides of the same brain.

Fig. 255.—Lateral view of the brain of a bush-woman (from Marshall). The references to this figure are the same as to Fig. 254, which should be studied with it. Note.—In order to facilitate the study of the convolutions of the brain, copies of two drawings from Mr. Marshall's paper on the brain of a bush-woman ("Philosophical Trans.," 1864), are by his permission insertedj so that the student may have the simplest form for reference when studying the more complex brain of Europeans.

THE POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 129 1. The Peroneal (12), always of considerable size and sometimes larger than the posterior tibial, comes off about two inches below the popliteus. It lies first between the tibialis posticus and flexor longus pollicis, but afterwards pierces the fibres of the flexor pollicis and runs close to the fibula to near its lower end. In this part of its course it gives muscular branches, and the nutri- tious artery to the fibula, which runs from the knee-joint. It then gives a good-sized anterior peroneal branch to the front of the leg between the tibia and fibula below the interosseous mem- brane, which will be afterwards dis- sected ; and a communicating branch to join that from the posterior tibial. The peroneal artery ends below the ex- ternal malleolus by anastomosing with the malleolar and plantar arteries. 2. Muscular branches are given to the deep muscles and also to the soleus.

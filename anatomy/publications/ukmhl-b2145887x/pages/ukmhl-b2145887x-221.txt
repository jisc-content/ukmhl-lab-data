PARTS BEHIND THE INNER MALLEOLUS. 131 Fig. 65. taken of them in this part of their course, as their relations are important. A portion of the skin on the inner side of the heel and sole of the foot is to be reflected if necessary, so as to expose the whole breadth of the internal annular ligament, which stretches from the inner malleolus to the os calcis and gives origin by its lower border to one head of the abductor pollicis. The divisions in the annular ligament are four in number, and are occupied as follows, beginning from the tibia. In the first division is the tibialis posticus ; in the second the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum; in the third the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, though this nerve is generally divided; and in the fourth the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis* but this last lies so deeply in order to pass in the grooves in the astragalus and os calcis that it is not readily seen from the side. Each of the tendons is lubricated by a distinct synovial membrane (Fig. 65). The Sole of the Foot.

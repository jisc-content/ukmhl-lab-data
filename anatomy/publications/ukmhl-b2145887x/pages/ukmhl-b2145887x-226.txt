The nerve also gives muscular branches to the flexor brevis pollicis and the two inner lunibricales muscles, and cutaneous branches to the sole. The External plantar nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in front of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and ac- cessorius in its course. At the outer border of the accessorius 1 divides into superficial and deep portions, the deep accompanying the artery. The superficial por- tion supplies the flexor brevis urinimi digiti and the interosseous muscles in the fourth or oute- most space, and gives cutaneous branches to the sole.

Entering the mediastinum, they anastomose to form the rete testis (5), which terminates in the vasa efferentia (6); and these, from twelve to fifteen in number, pierce the tunica albuginea to form the com vasmlosi (7) of the globus major of the epididymis. The ducts are now all collected into one, which by its convolutions forms the body and globus minor of the epididymis, and ends in the vas deferens, which enters the abdomen through the inguinal canal, and has been traced to its opening into the sinus poculans of the Attached to the to?10oSftathe testis immediately in front of the oil white bodv which has been supposed by M.

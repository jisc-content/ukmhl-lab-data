The twisting of the biceps; tendon has already been re- ferred to. By slightly displacing the supinator longus outwards, the musculo-spiral nerve will be seen lying between it and the brachialis anticus and dividing into radial and pos- terior interosseous nerves ; but this nerve is not, strictly speaking, in the triangle. The radial nerve may be traced for a short distance upon the stipulator brevis, whilst the posterior interosseous can be seen entering its fibres. It is supposed that by the time the dissection of the bend of the elbow is finished the subject will be turned, in which case the student of the arm should dissect the first two layers of the muscles of the back (see Dissection of the Back), proceeding afterwards with the following dissections. If necessary, however, the dissection * Artificial Memory, NAT. Pig. 9.â€”The bend of the elbow (from University College Museum). 1. Biceps. 5. Anastomosis of superior profunda 2. Median nerve. 3.

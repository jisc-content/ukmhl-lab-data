562 THE, PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.-The external lateral la- ment (Fig 192, 5) is a short thick hand of fibres broader above than Passes obliquely downwards and backwards from the lower border of the root of the zygoma to the neck of the jaw. It is continuous with the capsular ligament, which is attached to the matins of the articular Surfaces, and is sometimes described as con- Fig. 191.

The inter-articular fibre-cartilage (Fig. 193, 3) is seen to fit into the glenoid cavity, and its upper surface is accordingly concavo-convex from before backwards, the lower surface being concave. the cartilage, together with the condyle, being detached from the temporal bone and turned forward with the external pterygoid muscle, will be found to be oval in outline and thicker at the margins than in the centre, which is occasionally perforated. The internal lateral ligament (Fig. 194, 4) now fully exposed, is a membranous band, narrow above, where it is attached to the spineof the sphenoid bone and is crossed widening below to be attached to the projecting margin oi the dental Zmen It is covered by the inferior dental nerve and^xtgyat to bring the muscles into view. _ _ 1.

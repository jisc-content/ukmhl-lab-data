LIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 72 are antagonistic in the fact that the pectoralis major draws the arm acrosfthe chest after rotating it, whilst the latissimus dors, draws it behind the back. n , ^WvWr The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 30, 5) » -en to bloosal0. m partial dislocation of the humerus now that all the muscleare divided, and rough, owing to the insertion of some of the mu cl of the scapula into it.

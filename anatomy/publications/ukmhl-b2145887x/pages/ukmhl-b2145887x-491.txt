MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF NOSE. 401 or Schneiderian membrane, and is thickest over the turbinate bones, particularly the lowest, and on the septum ; but is thin on the floor, and in the sinuses connected with the nose. The upper part of the mucous membrane both on the outer and inner walls of the fossa is peculiar, and has been named the Olfactory- Region, from the fact that the branches of the olfactory or first nerve are distributed to it. It is impossible to distinguish this region except immediately after death, but it comprises the upper and a portion of the middle turbinate bones, and the corresponding portion of the septum.

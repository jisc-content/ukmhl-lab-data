The Superior Constrictor (Fig, 205, n) arises from the lower third of the internal pterygoid plate and from the hamular process of the sphenoid hone ; from the pterygo- maxillary ligament opposite the at- tachment of the huccinator ; ironi the inner surface of the lower jaw ahove the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and slightly from the side of the tongue. The fibres curve backwards, leaving an interval between the muscle and the base oi the skull in which the fibrous bag of the pharynx is visible, and are inserted into the median raphe, bent Wapped at the lower part by the middle constrictor D s ^tendinous fibres may occasionally be traced the under surface of the basilar process, to which the fibious ba oi h pharynx is attached. The superior constrictor is separated from bemmdle constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus ^ ! artery, and the levator palati muscle and the SachtS cross oblio^n^ muscles of the pharynx (from Wilson). 11.

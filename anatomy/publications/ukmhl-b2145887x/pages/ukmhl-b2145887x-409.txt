NERVES OF THE ORBIT. 319 [The rectus having been divided, a quantity of fat will be brought into view, through which the optic nerve passes to the eye-ball. The nasal branch of the 5th is at once to be looked for crossing the optic nerve from without inwards, and the lenticular ganglion, a minute pink body, is to be found on the outer side of the optic nerve. All small branches of nerve running from the ganglion along the optic nerve are to be preserved, and all branches of the ophthalmic artery.] Fig. 171. Fig. 171.â€”Nerves of the orbit, seen Ar 1.

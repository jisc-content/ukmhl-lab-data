The Omo-hyoid (Fig. 176, 17) can now be seen in its whole length, crossing the neck beneath the sterno-mastoid and consisting of two bellies nnited by a small tendon, which has been seen to be held down to the clavicle and first rib by a process of the deep cer- vical fascia (v. p. 310). It arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch, and from the transverse ligament which converts the supra-scapular notch into a hole. It is inserted into the body _ot the hyoid bone external to the sternohyoid, and superficial to .he thyro-hyoid muscle. vtm»A These four muscles are direct or indirect depressors of the hyoid bone. They are all supplied by the descender* nam nerve, except the thyro-hyoid, which receives a special branch from the 9th nerve. The Digastric (Fig. 176, 1) muscle consists of two portions placed in front of and behind the submaxillary^ gland abovejhe hyoid bone, to which the intermediate tendon is attached. It am* from the gr'oove on the inner side of the mastoid process of^ the em poral bone; and is inserted into the digastric fossa rttobm border of the inferior maxilla close to the median line. Its action is to open the mouth, or if the jaw is fixed, to raise the hyoid bom. and larynx.

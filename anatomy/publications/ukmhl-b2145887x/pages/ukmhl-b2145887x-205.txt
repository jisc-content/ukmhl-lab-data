POPLITEAL NERVES. 115 The Internal Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 54,4) is the most superficial of the important.structures in the ham. It is one of the divisions of tne great sciatic nerve, and passes with a very slight degree of obliquity from the outer to the inner side of the ham, extending through, the whole 'length of the space and disappearing beneath the gastrocnemius muscle. It thus crosses from the outer to the inner side of the popliteal artery, which it accompanies to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its branches are (1) articular, which pierce the posterior surface of the knee-joint and accom- pany the inferior internal and azygos articular arteries ; (2) muscular to the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and popliteus ; and (3) the external saphe- nous nerve or ramus communicans tibialis, which lies in the groove between the heads of the gastrocne- mius (sometimes beneath a few of its fibres), and will be traced in the dis- section of the back of the leg. The External Popliteal Nerve or Peroneal (Fig. 55, 8), the other division of the great sciatic, is alto- gether under cover of the biceps at the upper part of the space, but be- comes visible close to its tendon near the head of the fibula. It gives a com- municating branch (ramus communi- €°^^^ ^AmJoZ^* °f th& (from Hirschfeld and LeveiUe. 1. Adductor magnus 2. Vastus externus. 3. Popliteal vein. 4. Great sciatic nerve, o.

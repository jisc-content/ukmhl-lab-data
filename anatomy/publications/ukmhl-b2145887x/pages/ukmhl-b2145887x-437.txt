347 THE EXTERNAL EAR. Fig. 183. behind the lower margin of the orbit; the handle of the knife being then brought against the forehead, and the point pushed downward and a little outward, it will be felt to be in the nasal duct, and a probe can be passed down into the nose without difficulty. The lids being separated, close to the inner canthus will be seen a small space called the lacus lachrymalis, and on the free margin of each Hd close to this will be seen a little eminence (papilla lachrymalis) perforated by a minute hole, the punctum lachrymale (9). A small probe introduced vertically through the punctum will pass hori- zontally along the canaliculus into the lachrymal sac (12), situated in the groove in the lachrymal bone and beneath the tendo oculi. This is a delicate fibrous bag wider above than below, where it is con- tinuous with the nasal duct. It is lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epi- thelium. The canali- culi may be opened up upon the probe or with a fine-pointed pair of scissors, when a good- sized probe may be readily introduced into the sac and be pushed down into the nasal duct and nose. If the upper lid is everted over a probe, the con- junctiva lining it, with the Meibomian glands Fig. 183.â€”The pinna and its muscles 1. Helix. Cms helicis. Spina helicis.

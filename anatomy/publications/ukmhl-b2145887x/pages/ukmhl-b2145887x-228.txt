The accessories is supplied by the external P^ar n-ve ; the two inner lumhricales by the internal plantar, and the Uo outer lumbricales by the external plantar nerve. The tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 70 4) alter lvincr in the -roove below the lesser process of the os calcis, runs &ard to th^ great toe, lying beneath the nerves, and being crossed by the tendon of the which it is connected by a lew nores. ine tendon lies between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis and then enters a sheath, in which it is enclosed until its insertion into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great toe. [The long tendons and the accessorius miscle are to be cut about the middle of the Sot and turned down, when the muscles of the third layer are to be cleaned.] The Third Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversa ^The Plexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 70, 5) arises by a narrow tendinous origin from the under surface of the external cuneiform bone and adjacent surface of the cuboid, and 1 connected with the insertion of the tibiahs posticus.

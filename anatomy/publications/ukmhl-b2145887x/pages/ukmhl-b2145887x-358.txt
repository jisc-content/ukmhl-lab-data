The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) closely resembles that viscus m the male, but is rather larger, and its fundus is in contact with the vagina instead of with the rectum. The Urethra (Fig. 148, 6) in the female is about an inch and a half long, placed immediately beneath the pubes and curved upwards slightly to the bladder. It may be said to correspond to the prostatic and membranous urethra of the male. The Uterus (Fig. 148, 18) is situated behind the bladder, and, it in its proper position and healthy, its upper end or fundus shoiild not reach above a line drawn from the upper edge of the pubic symphysis to the lumbo-sacral articulation (Savage). The uterus is tilted slightly forwards so that its axis corresponds to that ol the pelvis, and its lower end or cervix is received into the upper end ot the vagina. . r , -, * The Broad Ligament (Fig. 109, 6) of the uterus is the fold of peritoneum attached to each side of the fundus, in which are three partial subdivisions, viz., a superior in which is the FaUopian tube an anterior in which is the round ligament of the uterus, and a posterior covering the ovary. The right round ligament of the uterus is now to be traced from the internal abdominal ring to the fundus of the uterus, but the Fallopian tube and ovary may be more conveniently examined with the uterus at a later period. . • The Vagina (Fig. 148, 12) is a curved tube of which the anterior wall is considerably shorter than the posterior, the former m he virgin rarely exceeding two inches in length, but the lat er being nearly twice as long (Savage). It is in contact with the bladder in fron and with the rectum behind at the lower part but the recto- " illpouch of peritoneum intervenes between the two organs above The neck of the uterus projects backwards into the upper extremity of the vagina, and its lower extremity passes through the levator ani muscle and is surrounded by the sphincter vagina, [The viscera of the pelvis being drawn down.to the> le^the internal iliac vessels and sacral plexus of ^$g*Jfi^the examined, and they should also be dissected_on pelvis, which has been preserved lor the ]urpos^e ^es 0*f be taken to trace branches of the sympathetic neive to the pelvic organs.] The Internal Iliac Artery (Fig. 149, 4) ia a branch of the com-

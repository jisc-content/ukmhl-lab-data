INN EE SIDE OF THE THIGH. 102 The Branches of the Profunda are the external and internal circumflex, three perforating arteries, and a terminal branch, besides branches to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. l; The External circumflex artery arises from the outer side of the • profunda near its origin, and has been already seen in the dissection of the thigh (p. 97). 2. The Internal circumflex artery (Fig. 48) arises from the inner side of the profunda near its origin, and passing beneath the pectineus, reaches the obturator externus muscle above the adductor brevis, when it divides into two ter- minal branches. One passes superficially to the adductor brevis, to supply the muscles on the inner side of the thigh; the other passes beneath the adductor brevis, and after giving a branch to the hip- joint, ends in a branch which will be found between the quadratus femoris and ad- ductor magnus in the dissec- tion of the buttock. 3. The Perforating arteries (Fig. 48) which are three in number, pierce the adductor, muscles to reach the ham- strings, which thev supply on their deep surfaces. The upper and Series perforate the adductors brevis and magnus ; the fa£ arises below the level of the adductor brevis, and therefore p ^rforat s only the adductor magnus. The nutritious artery to he femur generally comes from the middle perforating artery, and when end - ing the foramen in the linea aspera has a direction from the knee ^ The Terminal branch (Fig. 48) ends in the fibres of the adductor magnus. .

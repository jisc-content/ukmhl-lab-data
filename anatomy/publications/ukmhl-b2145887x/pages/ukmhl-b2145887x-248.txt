Fig. 85. and passes horizontally to the posterior surface of the astragalus behind the articulation with the tibia (Fig. 83, 5). The Calcaneo-astragaloid Articulation has external, posterior, and interosseous ligaments. The external is a short band passing obliquely backwards from the side of the astragalus to the upper margin of the greater process of the os calcis. The posterior is placed between the posterior parts of the two bones, close to the groove in the astragalus through which the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis passes. The interosseous ligament will be seen when the joint is opened. It is a strong thick band, passing from the groove between the two inferior articular surfaces of the astragalus, to the cor- responding groove between the two convex articular surfaces on the superior aspect of the calcaneum.

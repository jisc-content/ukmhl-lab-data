This may be most satisfactorily and safely relieved by cutting cautiously inwards with a hernia knife, so as to notch or divide Gimbernat's liga- ment ; but if this should not prove sufficient, the sac must be carefully opened and the stricture divided from within it. The only possible danger which can be met with in the deep inci- sion, is an abnormal distribution oi the obturator artery (Figs. 43 and 44), which, if it arise from the epi- gastric artery and wind close to the inner side of the neck of the sac, might be divided and give rise to troublesome haemorrhage, fortu- nately this vessel, if it exists, is seldom damaged by a cautious use of the knife, and, as it is impossible ta ascertain its presence beforehand, its existence may be ignored m PraCtlCli' „f «,«. mnxa part of the front of the thigh expose Scarpa's triangle.] £ htXUe see, to enclose anu support all the muscles of the thigh nio-ingumcd nerve, which Cutaneous nerve^Fv * >.ml ^ Qne or tw0 small emerges from the externa <*u branches to the thigh. ___ ^ Femoral sheath. °- x"1 ° 1.

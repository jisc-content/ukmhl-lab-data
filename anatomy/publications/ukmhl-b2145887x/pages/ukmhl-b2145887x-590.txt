500 INNER SURFACE OF THE HEMISPHERE. the occipital hie (o) by the parieto-occipital fissure (p o), a continuation of the fissure of the same name seen externally. The Occipital Lobe (o) is triangular in shape, and is placed between the parieto-occipital and the calcarine fissure (c), which separates it from the internal convolutions of the temporal lobe (t). The Calcarine Fissure (c) of Huxley runs below the occipital lobe to the extremity of the gyrus fornieatus, being joined midway by the parieto-occipital fissure. It is an important fissure, since it corre- sponds to the projection called the hippocampus minor m the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. . The Internal Temporal Convolutions form the lower part of the inner waU of the hemisphere, and are continuous with those of the temporal lobe externally. The most important is the Uncinate Gyrus (3), which is immediately below the calcarine fissure and runs horizontally ior- Fi°\ 256.-—The inner and under surfaces of the Drain to show the convolutions (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

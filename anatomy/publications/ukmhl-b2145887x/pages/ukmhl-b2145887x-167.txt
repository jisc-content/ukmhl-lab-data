77 THE WRIST JOINT. Fig. 36. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 35, 5) is longer than the external, and is attached to the styloid process of the ulna, and to the upper surface of the cuneiform bone. The Bones of the Carpus (Fig. 35, 6) are bound together by vertical and transverse dorsal and palmar, and at each side by slender lateral ligaments, which will not repay a special dissec- tion ; also by interosseous liga- ments which bind together the several bones of each row (except the pisiform which has a sepa- rate capsular ligament), and will be seen when the joints are opened (Fig. 36). The Metacarpal Bones (Fig. 35, 8) (with the exception of the first) are connected with the second row of the carpus by dorsal and palmar ligaments, and the four metacarpal bones are joined together by transverse dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments. The first metacarpal bone has a separate capsular ligament con- necting it with the trapezium, this joint being enarthrodial (Fig. 35, g). The^ bones of the carpus and metacarpus are capable only of a slight gliding or arthrodial movement, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which is capable of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction.

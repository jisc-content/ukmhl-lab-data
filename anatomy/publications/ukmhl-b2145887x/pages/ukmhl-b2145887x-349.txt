THE PELVIC FASCIA. 259 of the obturator foramen, the extremities of the two cuts being about an inch apart in the bottom of the cavity. These are to be joined by a vertical cut with the chisel, and the piece of bone having been loosened with that instrument can be removed with the bone-forceps. "With the chisel and bone-forceps the margins of the obturator fora- men may then be cut away so as to leave only a ring of bone. The obturator internus being now fully exposed, should be carefully detached from the adjacent structures, and may then be readily Fig. 144. removed by graspmg the tendo- with the bone-forceps and drawing the whole muscle out through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia will then be exposed.] _ The Pelvic Fascia (Fig. 144) consists of several more or less distinct structures, which are however in many places continuous with one another. It is a single layer down to the level of a white Fig. 144.â€”Pelvic fascia seen from the outside (drawn by J. T. Gray). External cutaneous nerve Poupart's ligament. Sartorius. Anterior crural nerve.

466 THE THORAX. transverse process of the vertebra to the rough non-articular portion of the tubercle of the rib (Fig. 244, 5). Tin order to see the middle costo-transverse ligament it will be necessary to make a horizontal section through the transverse process of a vertebra and the neck of the corresponding rib, when the short ligament will be found between the two.] The Middle Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 244, 4) consists of short strong fibres passing between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib and the corresponding transverse process. A synovial membrane exists between the facet upon each ot the transverse processes of the ten upper dorsal vertebrae and the articu- lar tubercle of the corresponding rib. # The anterior extremity of each rib has a hollow into which the costal cartilage fits, being firmly united by the periosteum. Chondro-Sternal Articulation.â€”The cartilages of the true ribs fit into depressions on the side of the sternum, and are attached by anterior and posterior ligaments. A band attaching the seventh rib to the xiphoid cartilage is called the costo-xiphoicl ligament The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth cartilages are connected together by fibrous bands. _ Synovial Membranes.-^ first costal cartilage is continuous with the sternum and has no synovial cavity. The second and tod car- tilages have a double synovial membrane, owing to the existence ot an Particular ligament. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh car- tilages have a single synovial membrane at the external articulation, and there are in addition three synovial membranes between the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth costal cartilages respectively.

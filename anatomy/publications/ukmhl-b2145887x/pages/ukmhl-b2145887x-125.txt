THE TRICEPS MUSCLE. 35 separated by another somewhat triangular interval from the back of the upper third of the humerus, until it joins the fibres of the external head at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone. The outer head arises from immediately below the insertion of the teres minor into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and from the outer side of the posterior aspect of the bone, as far down as the mus- culo-spiral groove ; also slightly from the external intermuscular septum, which intervenes be- tween it and the deltoid. The inner head arises from the whole of the posterior aspect of the humerus below the insertion of the teres major and the musculo- spiral groove, to within half an inch of the elbow-joint on the inner side, and extending to the back of the condyle on the outer side. Its fibres arise on each side from the intermuscular septa which intervene between it and the muscles of the front of the arm. The whole of the fibres converge to be inserted into the top of the olecranon process of Fig. 11.—Dissection of back of upper arm (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Infra-spinatus. 2. Deltoid. 3.

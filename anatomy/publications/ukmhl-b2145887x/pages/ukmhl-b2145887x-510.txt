The plates of both series are arranged one within another, the superficial ones being slightly bent towards the surface and the deeper ones towards the centre. < The Articular Processes are surrounded by Capsular Ligaments me 220, 2), which are looser in the cervical than in the dorsal and lumbar regions ; they permit a simple gliding movement (arthrodia) between the processes, which are invested by a simple synovial membrane. » The Arches are united by the Ligamenta Subflava (Fig. 220, i). These are to be seen on the internal surfaces of the arches which have been removed, and wiU be found to consist of a series of yellow elastic ligaments, extending between the arches of the vertebrae on each side of the middle line from the axis to the sacrum. Owing to the overlapping of the vertebrae, the ligaments are attached to the posterior surface of the arch below and to the anterior surface of the arch above, ex- tending from the articular process to the root of the spinous process on each side.

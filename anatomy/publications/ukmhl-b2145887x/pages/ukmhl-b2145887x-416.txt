326 SIDE OF THE NECK. seen the sterno-hvoid, the sterno-thyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles ; and the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid which runs obliquely across the triangle, dividing it into an upper and lower part. The common carotid artery comes into view between thesterno- mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles, with the descensus nomnerve superficial to it, and the internal jugular vem to its outer side and concealing the pneumo-gastric nerve. The external and internal carotids are seenat, or near, the upper border of the thyroid^cartdage and are crossed superficially by the hypoglossal nerve ; both cro s the superior laryngeal nerve, which is seen passing to the larynx be- tween the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx, to the inner side of the carotid vessels. The superior thyroid, Ungual, and facial arteries are seen m par. in the aJerior portion of the space ; and the occipital _artery » s en turning backwards below the digastric, and m relation with the hypoglossal nerve. between the two clavicles, may be cleaned. J Sterno-Clavicular Articulation (Fig. 175). The Inter-clavicular Kgrnrntfy) is a inter-clavicular notch of the —, a^attache^tott* Was ties of the two clavicles. The Stemo-clavicular liga- ment (i) may be considered to form a capsule to the joint, or may be divided into an- terior and posterior ligaments. The fibres pass obliquely from the inner extremity of the cla- vicle to the margin of the arti- cular surface of the sternum. Fig. 175. 1. Anteriorsterao-clavicular ligament. 2. Inter-clavicular ligament. 3. Costo-clavicular or rhomboid liga- ment ; seen on both sides. 4. Inter - articular fibro - cartilage, brought into view by the re- moval of the anterior and posterior ligaments. Anterior costo-sternal ligaments of the first and second ribs.

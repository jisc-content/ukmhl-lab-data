The Thyro-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, c) connects the lower border of the epiglottis Fig. 217.' with the back of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the notch in its upper border. The Hyo-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, b) is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the apex of the epiglottis and the upper border of the hyoid bone. Cartilages of the Larynx. [The large cartilages of the larynx, viz. the thyroid, cricoid, two arytenoid, and the cartilage of the epiglottis, are readily re- cognised, but two pairs of minute cartilages, the cornicula laryngis and the cuneiform cartilages, are to be looted for in the arytseno- epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane.] The Thyroid Cartilage (Fig. 214, i) (6vpe6s etSo?,like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx, and consists of two halves or alee, which meet at an angle give attachmenttoJh^rico:t^ l^iT^Y^^ tongue (from Universrty • Jug-i" ' College Museum). ^ .„ • i1of^ 7.

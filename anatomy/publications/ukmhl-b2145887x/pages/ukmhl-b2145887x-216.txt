The Tibialis Posticus (Fig. 61, 8) is the only one of the deep muscles which is attached to both bones of the leg, between which it therefore lies, its tendinous surface forming septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique Hue and external to the flexor longus digitorum, to within two inches of the ankle ; from nearly the whole length of the interosseous membrane ; and from the whole of the internal surface of the fibula immediately behind the interosseous line * as well as from the intermuscular septa on each side, which are continuous with the aponeurosis over it The muscle is overlapped by the flexor digitorum, and between the tibial and fibular origins the anterior tibial vessels pass. The fibres end in a single broad tendon, which passes beneath and then to the inner side of that of the * The internal surface here spoken of is not the sur- face called internal by Cloquet Cruyeilhiei-Wilson and Holden, which includes the surface m front of the inter osseous line,-nor that considered internal by Waid and Grav which extends from the interosseous line to the nosterio: border of the bone; but is the surface existing Tly in the middle of the bone, between the rnterosseous SJand an oblique line which cuts it oft from the posterior surface.

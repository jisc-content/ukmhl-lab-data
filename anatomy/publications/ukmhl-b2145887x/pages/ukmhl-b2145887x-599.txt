The Cerebellum. The Cerebellum (Fig. 253, 28) or small brain lies beneath the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, and in the skull is separated from Lm by the tentorium cerebelli. It is of a darker colour than the cerebrum, and its surface is divided into laminae instead of convolu- tions and these are separated by shallow sulci. The cerebellum is

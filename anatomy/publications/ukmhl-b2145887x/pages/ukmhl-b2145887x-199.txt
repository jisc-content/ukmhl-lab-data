THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS AND GEMELLI. 109. the inner surface of the pelvis in front of and behind the obturator foramen, and also from the inner surface of the obturator membrane. The tendon winds out of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, and being joined by the gemelli, passes for- • wards and outwards beneath the tendon of the pyriformis (with • which it is more or less united), : to be inserted into a depression ; at the anterior part of the upper : margin of the great trochanter. The gemelli (twin muscles) are ; placed above and below the tendon of the obturator internus and are inserted into it, but one or both may be absent; the superior arises Ifrom the spine of the ischium i and adjacent portion of the lesser sciatic notch ; the inferior urises from the upper and back part of the tuber ischii, and is the larger . and more constant muscle. If the tendon of the obturator internus be divided near its in- • sertion without disturbing the gemelli, and drawn up from the margin of the sciatic foramen a large bursa will be found, which, when opened, will be seen to lubricate the under surface of the tendon and the margin of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The under surface of the obturator tendon is subdivided into from three to five small tendons, and the margin of the bone is encrusted with cartilage and grooved to corres- pond with these.

It is continuous with the iliac fascia in the pelvis, and passes upwards over the psoas to be attached to the lower edge of the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, and to the sides of the bodies of the vertebra from which the muscle takes its origin. It is owing to this fascia that " psoas abscess," the result of diseased spine, is conducted along the psoas muscle to the inner side of the thigh. The Iliac fascia covers the iliacus interims muscle and is con- tinuous with the fascia over the psoas magnus, being strengthened

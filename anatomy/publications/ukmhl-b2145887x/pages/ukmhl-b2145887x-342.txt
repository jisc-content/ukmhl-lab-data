VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 252 Fig. 136. capsular branches from the fibrous tissue of the organ, and subse- quently divide until their branches run bet.een the minute obul s o1, acini, and are therefore called ^Ij^l interlobular veins, from which the lobular plexus of capillaries is derived, converging to the centre of each lobule and pouring its blood into the intra- lobular vein (a). Each in- tralobular vein passes out of the lobule at right angles to the portal vessels, and unites with other in- tralobular veins to form the sublobular veins ; these open into the vena; cavce hepaticw or hepatic veins, which have been traced into the vena cava. The appearance of a piece of minutely injected liver is shown ^ 135g The commencement of each primary hepatic duct is m^thecentre of each minute lobule, being continuous, according to Beale with the basement membrane upon which the hepatic cells are placed. But according to other observers, the ducts commence in inter- cellular passages or biliary capillaries, with „n„ fVicr l-Vn The minute ducts proper walls (.big. i-^'h ^ i^ip run towards the circumference of the lobule, and the radicles of adjacent lobules unite, the resulting ducts running along the portal canals by the side of the portal vein to emerge eventually at the transverse fissure.

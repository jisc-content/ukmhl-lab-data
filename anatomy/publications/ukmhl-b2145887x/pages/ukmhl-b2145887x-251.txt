THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES OF THE FOOT. .161 the astragalus and the upper surface of the os calcis will now be seen. It is attached to the deep groove found between the two articulations in each bone. An interosseous ligament will also be seen, when the astragalus is displaced, passing from the upper border Fig. 87. of the greater process of the os calcis to the cuboid and scaphoid bones. • The 4th synovial membrane (iv) is placed between the greater process of the os calcis and the back of the cuboid bone, and, when it is opened, the peculiar manner in which the two bones are locked together will be seen. An interosseous ligament will be found between the os calcis and cuboid bone to the inner side of the synovial cavity. The 5th synovial membrane (v) is between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and will be found to pass between the middle and external cuneiform bones to their anterior surfaces, and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones (vn). It is also prolonged into the articulations between the second, third, and Fig. 87.-Section to show the seven synovial membranes of the foot (from Wilson). v 9* T!,+?.o'„„■!„,. 8.

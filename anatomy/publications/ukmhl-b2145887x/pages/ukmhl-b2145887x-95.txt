PAKT I. DISSECTION OF THE ARM. [The Student is requested to read the 1 Introduction' before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the dissection, the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part, and the relations of surface-markings to deeper structures ; and if he has already dissected this region, he should make the incisions necessary to expose the several arteries in the positions in which they are usually tied, according to the directions which accompany the description of each vessel, taking care not to disturb the tissues unnecessarily, and to stitch up the incisions without delay. The curves of the clavicle are generally seen with ease ; but the finger should be carried along the bone to note any irregularity denoting old fracture, and to trace its articulation with the acromion process of the scapula. The sterno-clavicular joint should also be examined, and if the arm is freely moved, the extensive range of motion in that joint will be better appreciated. The development of the mammary region will vary according to the sex and age of the subject. In the case of a female subject, the advanced student should notice the condition of the nipple and its surrounding areola, as indicating previous pregnancies or the contrary, and may advan- tageously practise removal of the breast by two elliptical incisions, one above, the other below the nipple, taking great care to remove the whole of the breast, and not to leave any glandular tissue attached to the skin or the deeper structures. The roundness of the shoulder will be found to depend upon the projection of the head of the humerus beyond the bony arch formed above it by the acromion and clavicle, and in a thin subject the head of the bone and the bicipital groove may be readily felt when the arm is rotated. About a finger's breadth to the inner side of the

The Superficial Veins form ply the adjacent sides of the great and next toe ; and also a small branch to the inner side of the great toe. The External Plantar Nerve (Fig. 71, 5)â€”The deep portion of the nerve accompanies the artery beneath the adductor pollicis, in which it ends. In its course it gives small branches to the two outer himbricales, to the transversus pedis, and to all the interosseous muscles both plantar and dorsal, except those of the fourth or outermost inter- osseous space, which are supplied by the superficial portion. The Fourth Layer of Muscles consists of the plantar interossei, which will be better seen when the dorsal interossei are dissected. Front of the Leg and Foot.

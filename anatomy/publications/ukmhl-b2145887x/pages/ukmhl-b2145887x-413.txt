323 THE OBLIQUUS INFEEIOE. Fig. 174. The Obliquus Inferior (Fig. 174, 9) muscle lies transversely in the orbit beneath the rectus inferior. It arises from the superior maxilla behind the lachrymal groove, and passing below the inferior rectus, but between the external rectus and globe, is inserted into the sclerotic above the level of the rectus externus and close to the in- sertion of the obliquus super- ior. • The actions of the muscles of the orbit are not very readily appreciated, owing to the fact that the movements of the eyeball depend upon the com- bined influence of several of them. The action of the Levator palpebra3 is implied by its name • it raises the eyelid, and therefore when paralysed from some affection ot the third nerve, the characteristic dropping of the lid, ptosis, results. 1 ' The Recti muscles, when acting together, would draw the eye-ball towards the back of the orbit, but each, when acting separately would draw the front of the eye in its own direction ; the superior and inferior recti having in addition a tendency to draw the eye inwards Internal and external strabismus are produced by the direct action of the internal and external recti respectively The Oblique muscles when acting alone are rotators of the eye-ball ouWdTtr8', " "Tr1 °b%Ue I0Ui^ tU <** Awards and he Xt ^ m ComLinatio* *ith the recti, and thus give the oblique movements to the eye-ball.

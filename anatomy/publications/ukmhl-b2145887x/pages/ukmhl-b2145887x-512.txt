422 LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS, AXIS, AND OCCIPUT. The Posterior Occipito-Atlantal Ligament (Fig 222 3) re- sembles the ligamenta subflava, but is composed of white fibrous tissue It is thin aud membranous, and is attached above to the I0 teriorMargin of the foramen magnum, and below to the posterior arch of the atlas. On each side this ligament is perforated by the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, over which some of its fibres ^ The Lateral Occipito-Atlantal Ligaments (Fig. 222,4) are short strong bands, passix^between the roots of the t—se processes of the a&as and the jugular processes of the occipital bone. Fis. 222. Fig. 223. The Anterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 221, 4) resembles the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and consists of a-^P^ ^ a deep portion. The superficial portion is round, and is continuous titrthe anterior common ligament, being attached to the anterior Tubercle of the atlas and the body of the axis. The ^J™j broad and thin, and extends from the anterior arch of the atlas to the body of the axis.

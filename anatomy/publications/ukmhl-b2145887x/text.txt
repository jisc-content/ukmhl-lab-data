HOLME PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL SURGERY IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON, AND SURGEON TO UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL ; LATE EXAMINER IN ANATOMY AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND; HONORARY FELLOW OF KING'S COLLEGE FIFTH EDITION WITH 24 COLOURED PLATES AND 269' ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD LONDON J. & A. CHURCHILL NEW BURLINGTON STREET 1881PBEFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION ♦ In preparing a new edition of Practical Anatomy, I have had the advantage of submitting its pages to my friend and colleague, Mr. Eickman Godlee, who has care- fully revised it throughout. In deference to suggestions from Professor Thane and Dr. Carrington I have added a deep dissection of the neck from the side, and have made the dissection of the thorax a separate section. The number of coloured plates from Maclise's " Surgical Anatomy " has been increased to twenty-four, and a few new woodcuts have been added. 36, Cavendish Square, September, 1881.

By Practical Anatomy is meant the study of Anatomy by dissection of the dead body, in contradistinction to Descriptive Anatomy, taught by lectures, diagrams, and preparations. In dissecting, there are four principal objects to be constantly borne in mind by the student:—1st. The impression on the memory of those facts of general anatomy taught in the lectures. 2nd. The study of those parts of the body more especially concerned in surgical affections and operations. 3rd. The education of the sense of touch, and of the hand in the use of instruments ; and 4th, the education of the eye in the knowledge of the several tissues of the body, in various positions, and under varying, circumstances. It is to assist the student in these requirements that the following work is designed; and every effort has been made to present the facts of Anatomy in such a manner, that they may be most easily grasped by the mind and retained by the memory ; it will be found also, that as far as is compatible with a work of the kind, attention is drawn to all those points which have especial interest in the practice of medicine or surgery, and directions are given for the performance of many opera- tions which do not seriously interfere with or injure the dissection. The education of the eye is a gradual and tedious process, but one which is pretty certain to be satisfactorily accomplished if the student do but use his hands properly, and therefore a few words on the manual part of dissection may not be out of place. First, as to the INSTRUMENTS requisite for dissection. A case containing six or eight scalpels, two pairs of scissors, a pair of dissect- ing forceps, a set of chain-hooks, a blow-pipe, and a probe, will enable the student to make all requisite dissections, supposing that he is allowed the use of a saw and chisel in the dissecting-room. BINTRODUCTION. 2 Great variety exists in dissecting cases, both as to form and expense, but so long as the instruments themselves are strong and good, the simpler the case the better. SCALPELS-for dissection are made of two principal shapes ; in one, the edge is bevelled to the point, the back being straight; in the other, both back and edge are bevelled to a point midway be- tween the two. The latter form is preferable for most purposes. The blade should not be more than an inch and a half long, and never double-edged, but the material of which the handle is con- structed is a matter of indifference. For all ordinary dissection it will be found most convenient to hold the scalpel like a pen ; but for cleaning the fascia off muscles, and following out small nerves, it is better to hold it reversed, so that the back of the knife may be against the tissue which is to be preserved. In making the first incision through the skin of a limb, or in any other position where a long incision is required, the knife may, with advantage, be held under the hand, by which the wrist has more play, and the student has the opportunity of practising a mode of holding the knife which he will find very useful when operating on the living body. The FORCEPS should be broad at the extremities and coarsely serrated, so that it may retain a firm hold on small portions of tissue. It is very important that the forceps should not be too strong in the spring, for in that case it becomes so fatiguing to the hand that it is impossible to continue its use for any length of time. The forceps should be held lightly between the thumb and the first and second fingers of the left hand, which may be steadied by resting the little finger on a neighbouring part. The CHAIN" HOOKS should be strong, and bent in the direction of the thickness and not of the breadth of the steel, as is sometimes done. These latter are very inferior, being liable to be unbent under any considerable strain. Care should be taken that the chains are firmly linked, and that the central ring is sufficiently stout to bear any force that may be applied to it. The SCISSORS should be large and strong, and it will be found to be advantageous to have one curved pair, which is very useful in preparing the ligaments. Sounds and staffs will be required for the purpose of practising the introduction of instruments into the bladder ; but these are found in most dissecting-rooms, together with saws and other large tools requisite for dissection. The student will do well to bear in mind that he will probably be called upon in after-life to operate on the living body, the only true preparation for which is careful dissection ; he should therefore, asINTRODUCTION. 3 far as possible, conduct all his dissections as methodically^ and with as much care as if operating on the living body, and by this means he will do much to fit himself for his duties as a practical surgeon. The SKIN consists of two principal layers, the true skin or derma, and the scarf-skin or epidermis. In the dead body if at a 1 decom- posed, the epidermis or cuticle is easily separated, but should be cprefully preserved during the dissection, as it prevents the subjacent parts from drying. In removing the skin, the first incisions should be made at once through its whole thickness, and a corner being held with the forceps, the knife is to be carried with a sweeping movement beneath it, the edge being towards the skin and the back to the fascia, which should be left smooth and uniform. The under surface of skin neatly reflected is white, and the tissue beneath it more or less yellow. The SUPERFICIAL FASCIA consists of loose areolar tissue containing more or less fat. It contains the superficial blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, and may in some situations be divided into two lavers. The" DEEP FASCIA is a dense fibrous layer, white and glisten- ing in appearance. It lies beneath the superficial fascia and forms sheaths for the limbs ; being attached to various ridges of bone, and sending processes (intermuscular septa) between the muscles. In cleaning muscles, it is essential to have the fibres stretched and rendered tense, which may be accomplished by moving the limb or applying the hooks. A muscle should invariably be cleaned along its fibres, the dissector beginning at one edge and advancing steadily to the other, and thus reflecting a complete layer of fascia ; the knife being held with the back to the muscle, to avoid injury to it. The attachments of a muscle (origin and insertion) should be most care- fully followed out, and studied on the separate bones ; but it is important also to clean the fascia from the whole length of the muscle, or it will soon look dirty. A muscle should always be divided, when necessary, midway between its origin and insertion, so that these important points may be preserved for study. The ARTERIES of a subject are usually injected, and it is impossible to follow out all the minute branches without this assist- ance ; but opportunity should be taken by the advanced student to repeat his dissection upon an uninjected subject, in which the rela- tions and appearance of the parts more closely resemble those of the living body. The main trunks of the NERVES and their principal branches are readily followed out, but their minute ramifications require b 24 INTRODUCTION. more time and labour for their dissection than a student can afford to bestow upon them., The student should bear in mind that his manual labour is only a part of his duty, and will be thrown away, unless he at the same time study the description of the part upon which he is engaged ; he therefore should not carry the dissection further than he can learn the description on the same day, and at the subject; and should if possible re-peruse the description in the evening, and always on the next morning, before carrying the dissection any further. In order to preserve a part, it is essential that the dissector should himself secure the skin around it with a few stitches, and wrap it with damp cloths. These may be dipped in some preservative solu- tion, or common salt may be grated finely over the part. This latter, however, destroys the colour of the part and its smooth appearance. A dissected part should be sponged over daily, when it is uncovered for fresh dissection.PAKT I. DISSECTION OF THE ARM. [The Student is requested to read the 1 Introduction' before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the dissection, the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part, and the relations of surface-markings to deeper structures ; and if he has already dissected this region, he should make the incisions necessary to expose the several arteries in the positions in which they are usually tied, according to the directions which accompany the description of each vessel, taking care not to disturb the tissues unnecessarily, and to stitch up the incisions without delay. The curves of the clavicle are generally seen with ease ; but the finger should be carried along the bone to note any irregularity denoting old fracture, and to trace its articulation with the acromion process of the scapula. The sterno-clavicular joint should also be examined, and if the arm is freely moved, the extensive range of motion in that joint will be better appreciated. The development of the mammary region will vary according to the sex and age of the subject. In the case of a female subject, the advanced student should notice the condition of the nipple and its surrounding areola, as indicating previous pregnancies or the contrary, and may advan- tageously practise removal of the breast by two elliptical incisions, one above, the other below the nipple, taking great care to remove the whole of the breast, and not to leave any glandular tissue attached to the skin or the deeper structures. The roundness of the shoulder will be found to depend upon the projection of the head of the humerus beyond the bony arch formed above it by the acromion and clavicle, and in a thin subject the head of the bone and the bicipital groove may be readily felt when the arm is rotated. About a finger's breadth to the inner side of the6 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. head of the humerus, and indistinctly felt on account of the muscles attached to it, is the coracoid process, and the relation of these hones in health should he fully appreciated. Iu a muscular subject, a long, nearly vertical groove or dimple at this point marks the separation between the deltoid and pectoralis major ; and another, seen occasionally extending obliquely from near the inner end of the clavicle, marks the division between the sternal and clavicular fibres of the latter muscle. By lifting the arm and drawing it from the body, the anterior and posterior boundaries of the axilla will be made prominent, and the fascia extending from one to the other will be put on the stretch so that the finger cannot be pushed into the armpit; whereas if the arm is brought to the side the fascia is relaxed, and the finger will readily reach the head and neck of the humerus, with the great vessels and nerves to their inner side, and internal to these again, the wall of the thorax, with probably some lymphatic glands. The brachial artery and nerves can be traced along the inner border of the biceps to the bend of the elbow, and the shaft of the humerus can be readily felt. In front of the elbow is a hollow, corresponding to a space to be afterwards dissected, and occasionally the superficial veins stand out prominently, in which case ventesec- tion should be practised. The prominent internal condyle of the humerus and its relation to the olecranon process of the ulna are readily seen, and the ulnar nerve can be felt between the two points of bone. The rounded external condyle, with the ridge leading to it, can be felt in most subjects, as also the head of the radius, which should be rotated, that its relation to the condyle may be better appreciated. In the fore-arm the radius can be but little felt, except at its lower extremity; but the olecranon process and sharp posterior margin of the ulna are always to be distinguished even in very muscular subjects. It should be observed that the ulna is the more prominent of the two bones at its lower end, whilst the end of the radius is a little lower down than that of the ulna ; the styloid process of each can be readily distinguished. The tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris are usually prominent, and serve as guides to the radial and ulnar arteries, which may be felt (if injected) to the outer side of each tendon. The metacarpus and phalanges are to be examined, and the advanced student may advantageously amputate one or two fingers (middle or ring). It is to be borne in mind that the transverse markings, on either the palmar or dorsal aspect of the fingers, form no guide to the articulation, which is7 THE MAMMA. always nearer to the nail. When the finger is bent, the prominence at the articulation is due to the proximal phalanx, and the joint is below that point. The best rule, therefore, in amputating through the phalangeal articulations, is to bend the phalanx whichi is to be removed to a right angle with the one above it and to begin the incision at a point midway in the thickness of the upper phalanx, cutting transversely to a corresponding point on the opposite side The limb should be carefully bandaged from the fingers to the middle of the upper arm, and only uncovered as may be necessary m the progress of the dissection. (The arm being drawn away from the side an incision is to be made half an inch to one side of the median line of the sternum m its whole length, and to be joined at right angles by another running alone the whole length of the clavicle on to the acromion process and then?e in a vertical direction half-way clown the upper arm and then across the inner aspect of the arm as far as the posterior lold of the axilla Another incision is to be made transversely from the ensi- form cartilage, and must be carried beyond the posterior fold oi the armpit The large flap of skin thus marked out is to be reflected towards the arm, the dissector on the right side beginning at the lower end of the sternum, and on the left side at its upper extremity. J Beneath the skin is the subcutaneous fascia, which is often very fatty in the female. The mamma will also be exposed (an incision being carried round the nipple so as to leave it attached to the organ) in the female, or its rudiment in the male subject. In a well- developed body the fibres of the platysma myoides may be seen arising from the fascia below the clavicle. The Mamma, or breast, is a gland of very variable bulk lying upon the great pectoral muscle, from which it is separated by a quantity of loose cellular tissue. Its base is nearly circular, and usually extends from the side of the sternum to the margin of the anterior wall of the axilla, reaching from the third to the seventh rib in the vertical direction. Near its centre, and between the fourth and fifth ribs is the mamilla or nipple, around which is the areola of discoloured skin, the tint of which becomes darker as pregnancy advances. The nipple may be shown to be pierced by numerous small lactiferous ducts by introducing bristles into their openings, and its skin is thin and delicate. The gland consists of numerous lobules bound together by tough cellular tissue, and having a quantity of fat interspersed between them. Each lobule is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels and has a separate galactoferous duct. These last converge towards theDISSECTION OF THE ARM. 8 nipple, and beneath the areola become straight and somewhat dilated so as to form lacteal sinuses or ampulla;. Fig. 1.

Cutaneous Nerves and Vessels.—In the superficial fascia on the front of the chest are the anterior cutaneous branches of the inter- costal nerves and arteries. They appear at regular intervals on each side of the sternum as they pierce the pectoral muscle, and are of small size. The terminations of the descending branches of the superficial cervical plexus may also be found beneath, or piercing, the platysma, and crossing the clavicle in the positions their names imply, viz. sternal, clavicular, and acromial. [The pectoralis major is to be put on the stretch by drawing the arm from the side and supporting it at a convenient height, its fibres are then to be cleaned from below on the right, and from above on the left side.] Pectoralis Major (Fig. 1, i) consists of a sternal and a clavicular portion separated by a cellular interval. The sternal portion arises from the whole length of one side of the sternum and from the carti- lages of all the true ribs except the seventh, and is connected below with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The clavicular portion arises from the inner or sternal half of the anterior border of the clavicle, and is separated from the deltoid muscle by another cellular interval, containing the cephalic vein and the humeral branch of the acromio-thoracic artery. The two portions are united at their insertion into the anterior or outer edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus, the muscle being doubled upon itself near its insertion, so that the sternal fibres pass behind, and reach higher up the bone than, those from the clavicle. The deeper portion of the insertion is more tendinous than the superficial fibres, which are closely con- nected with the deltoid. The action of the pectoralis major is to rotate the humerus inwards and then cross it over the chest. If the arm were raised above the 12. External oblique. 13.

It may also act as an ex- traordinary muscle of inspiration when the arm is fixed, as is seen in the case of asthmatic persons. It is supplied by the external anterior- thoracic nerve and partly by the internal anterior thoracic nerve. In very well developed subjects, muscular slips are not unfrequently found lying at the side of the sternum and superficial to the pectoralis, with which they may have some connection ; but they are more frequently continuous with the sterno-mastoid or rectus abdominis. The Axilla. [If the arm is well drawn from the side the boundaries of the axilla or armpit will be readily seen, and if the skin has not been already removed from the posterior boundary (latissimus dorsi), it should now be turned back. The strong deep fascia will be seen stretching from the pectoralis to the latissimus dorsi, forming the base of the conical space known as the axilla ; and the student should again, notice that it is impossible to thrust the finger deeply into the space so long as the fascia is stretched by the extension of the arm, but that when the arm is drawn to the side the finger passes into the space, and can feel the axillary artery (if injected), and the head of the humerus partially.] The lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves are to be found behind the border of the pectoralis major, by carefully dividing the fascia parallel to the ribs. The first intercostal nerve has no lateral branch, but six lateral branches from the upper nerves (from 2nd to 7th) will be found appearing at the side of the chest, between the digitations of the serratus magnus. Each lateral cutaneous nerve, except that of the second, divides into anterior and posterior branches, which turn forwards to the pectoral region and backwards over the latissimus dorsi respectively (Fig. 2). The lateral cutaneous branch of the second nerve passes down the inner side of the arm to join the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or nerve of Wrisberg, and is hence called the intercosto-humeral nerve (24). The posterior branch from the third nerve usually accompanies and joins this. These last must be found at once and are to be carefully preserved. [All the fat is to be removed from the axilla, and the muscles cleaned so far as they are exposed, care being taken not to injure the axillary vessels (particularly the vein) and nerves, which are to the outer side of the space ; nor the posterior thoracic nerve, wlncliTHE AXILLA.

The base of the cone has already been seen to be the axillary fascia stretched between the anterior and posterior boundaries, and the apex will now be found with the finger in a triangular interval between the clavicle, the upper border of the scapula, and the first rib. The great vessels and nerves lie along the outer boundary of the space, the artery being between the nervous cords and the vein to their inner side, whilst the branches of the artery take a general direction towards the thorax. On the inner side of the space and imbedded in fat are the glands, ten or twelve in number, which receive the lymphatics from the mamma and arm, the superficial ones lying along the edge of the pectoralis, and the deeper ones in close proximity to the axillary vessels, occasionally even surrounding them. Opportunity is to be taken, before any further dissection is made, to expose the lower part of the axillary artery thoroughly, as that is the portion of the vessel to which a ligature may be best applied. Surgery.— To tie the axillary artery: the arm being drawn away from the trunk, an incision, three inches long, is to be made in the length of the limb, at a distance behind the edge of the pectoral muscle equal to one-third of the whole width of the axilla. On dividing the deep fascia, the large axillary vein will come into view, which must be drawn down and held aside, when the large nervous cords will be seen, and a little dissection will exjDose the axillary artery placed deeply between them. The aneurism needle is to be passed from below (in this position), i.e. between the vein and artery. When the axillary artery is tied the circulation in the limb will depend upon the anastomoses between the branches of the artery above and below the ligature, i.e. of the superior and acromio- thoracic with the subscapular and circumflex arteries. These last will also bring blood by their anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries from the thyroid axis. [The clavicular portion of the pectoralis major is to be divided vertically about its middle and reflected, without injui'ing the cephalic vein, when branches of the acromio-thoracic artery and the external anterior thoracic nerve will be seen entering its under surface. The upper border of the pectoralis minor will now be exposed, with the costo-coracoid membrane above it.] The Costo-Coracoid Membrane is the strong fascia seen im- mediately above the pectoralis minor, where it covers the axillary vessels and gives passage to the acromio-thoracic artery, the cephalic13 THE AXILLARY ARTERY. vein, and the external anterior thoracic nerve. It is attached to the coracoid process, to the lower surface of the clavicle, and to the first rib, and when divided will he seen to cover the axillary vessels and nerves and to enclose the subclavius muscle, being continued for some distance on the vessels, the sheath of which it strengthens. The Subclavius (Fig. 1, 5) is a small muscle which arises by a tendon from the cartilage of the first rib, and is inserted into the groove on the under surface of the middle third of the clavicle. It is a depressor of the clavicle, and is supplied by a special branch of the brachial plexus above the clavicle. The sheath of the axillary vessels is derived from the fascia in the neck, and passes beneath the clavicle. It is strengthened by a pro- cess of the costo-coracoid membrane, and is gradually lost upon the vessels. [The remains of the costo-coracoid membrane and sheath of the vessels are to be carefully removed without injury to the superior and acromio-thoracic arteries, and the axillary artery and vein and brachial nerves in their upper part are to be cleaned. This dissec- tion will admit light into the upper part of the axilla, and allow its boundaries and contents to be better studied. The remainder of the pectoralis major is then to be divided to expose the pectoralis minor with the long thoracic artery at its lower border.] The Pectoralis Minor (Fig. 1, 6) is beneath the pectoralis major, and therefore assists in forming the anterior boundary of the axilla. It arises from the anterior extremities of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, about an inch from their junctions with the cartilages, and is " inserted into the inner side of the coracoid process of the scapula, thus crossing obliquely the axillary vessels and nerves. The pectoralis minor would draw the coracoid process and scapula downwards, but is principally a muscle of inspiration, taking its fixed point from the coracoid process, and so raising the ribs. It is supplied by the internal anterior thoracic nerve. [The pectoralis minor is to be divided two inches from its insertion, when the axillary vessels and nerves will be fully exposed and are to be cleaned. The small nerve emerging from between the artery and vein, and entering the pectoralis minor, is the internal anterior thoracic] The Axillary Artery (Fig. 2, 11) is the continuation of the sub- clavian, and extends from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the insertion of the teres major.

The long thoracic (5) runs along the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the chest, where it supplies the mamma and is hence sometimes called the external mammary artery. It anasto- moses with the internal mammary, intercostal and subscapular branches. A separate external mammary artery often exists in females and assists in supplying the breast. 4. The alar thoracic (3) is a small branch to the axillary glands. It very seldom arises directly from the axillary, but generally from one of the other branches. 5. The subscapular (15) is a large branch which runs along the lower border of the subscapularis muscle to the side of the chest with the long subscapular, nerve, and then supplies the adjacent parts, anastomosing with the long thoracic artery. An inch or less from its origin this artery gives off a large branch, the dorsahs scapulce (17), which winds round thelower border of the subscapularis muscle and, after giving an infrasc^ular branch, disappears through a triangular interval, bounded (as seen from the front) by the long head of the triceps,.the teres major, and the subscapularis. ^ 6. The anterior circumflex is a small branch which winds round the neck of the humerus beneath the coraco-brachialis and biceps, which it supplies, giving also a branch up the bicipital groove to the shoulder-joint. . 7. The posterior circumflex (12) is larger than the anterior, and winds behind the neck of the humerus to supply the deltoid, passing through a quadrilateral space bounded (as seen in front) by the teres major, subscapularis, long head of the triceps, and the neck of the humerus. . . The Axillary Vein lies to the inner side of the artery, bemg tne continuation of the basilic vein from the lower border of the teres major; at a variable point it is joined by the vena comites of the brachial artery, and having received branches corresponding to those of the axillary artery, and the cephalic vein immediately below the. clavicle, it ends in the subclavian vein.

The several branches are to be thoroughly identified, and their relations to the vessels ascertained (vide Axillary Artery) ; but the description of the majority is more conveniently taken at a later stage of the dissection. The External anterior thoracic nerve (n) is a small branch derived from the outer cord, going to the under surface of the pectoralis major, which it supplies. The Internal anterior thoracic nerve (io) is a small branch from the inner cord, which passes between the axillary artery and vein to supply the pectoralis minor and, after communicating with the pre- ceding nerve, the pectoralis major. The Circumflex (Fig. 3, 19) is a large nerve from the posterior cord, and lies behind the axillary artery for a short distance, leaving it then to accompany the posterior circumflex artery through the quadrilateral space already described, and winding round the humerus to the deltoid, to which it will be subsequently traced. Three Subscapular nerves (Fig. 4, 27, 28, 29) are derived from the posterior cord. The long subscapular nerve is seen at the lower border of the subscapularis muscle accompanying the subscapular artery„ and ends in the latissimus dorsi, sometimes giving a branch •also to the upper part of the teres major. The two shorter sub- scapular nerves will be better dissected when the arm is removed; they enter the subscapularis and teres major muscles, and supply them, The Posterior or long thoracic nerve (external respiratory of Bell) (16) lies upon the serratus magnus, which it supplies, and is one of the supra-clavicular branches of the brachial plexus, being derived * The brachial plexus may consist occasionally of only two cords when it enters the axilla; in which case a third cord is formed below the clavicle by the union of branches derived from these two cords, the relations to the artery re- maining the same as are given above. 018 THE AXILLA. from the fifth and sixth nerves, with an occasional branch from the seventh ; it descends behind the brachial cords and axillary vessel* to its distribution upon the surface of the serratus.

The fibres have a general direction backwards to the inner surface of the base of the scapula, where they are inserted, but the first two dictations unite to form a thicker portion corresponding to the sur- face at the upper angle, while the last four form a still larger bundle, corresponding to the surface at the inferior angle of the scapula. These last slips interdigitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The serratus magnus is a great muscle of forced inspira- tion, taking its fixed point from the scapula, which is firmly held hj the rhomboids and levator anguli scapulae muscles, and thus raising the ribs. If the muscle has the ribs for its fixed point, the scapula is drawn forward, the bone gliding over the ribs and a quantity of loose cellular tissue which lies upon them, and the strong bundle inserted into the lower angle serving to antagonize the levator anguli scapulas and rotate the scapula so as to raise the arm above the head. The serratus is supplied by the posterior thoracic nerve. Insertions of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Major.—The upper part of the latissimus winds round the lower angle of the scapula, which it envelopes in a sort of fold, and ends in a broad, thin tendon, which passes in front of the teres major to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus above the level of the teres major. The tendon of the latissimus dorsi, like that of the pectoralis major, : is twisted, so that the fibres of the muscle which were highest at their origin are lowest at their insertion, and vice versd, and it is the narrowest of the three tendons inserted into the bicipital groove. The teres major, which is fleshy throughout, passes behind the tendon of the latissimus, being more or less incorporated with it, and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove, i exactly opposite the pectoralis major, a bursa being formed between the insertions of the latissimus and teres. Opportunity should be taken, when the clavicle is divided by the i dissector of the neck, to trace the axillary nerves to their origins, and to study the brachial plexus, the description of which is given with the " Posterior Triangle." 21.

("An incision is to "be made down the front of the arm to three inches below the bend of the elbow, and the skin is to be reflected on each side for a couple of inches, to allow of the dissection ol the superficial nerves and veins.] The Internal Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 5, 8) is to be followed out from the inner cord of the plexus to the fore-arm. It lies at first to the inner side of the axillary artery, and then, piercing the deep fascia at or near the point at which the basilic vein enters, it runs m front of the inner condyle and subdividing, sends branches both over and under the median basilic vein to the inner side of the fore-arm. A posterior branch winds above the inner condyle to the back of the fore-arm. . * The Lesser Internal Cutaneous Nerve (nerve of Wnsberg) (Fig. 5, 2), after joining with the intercosto-humeral nerve, pierces the&fascia at a variable point, and supplies the lower third of the inner side of the upper arm behind the internal cutaneous nerve. It is not always present. A cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve appears on the inner side of the upper arm, below the teres major, and is distributed to the skin (Fig. 5, 6). TThe veins of the arm are very variable, and the best way of dis- secting them therefore, will be to follow both basilic and cephalic veins down to the elbow, and to trace out their radicles.] The Median Vein (Fig. 5, 14) is near the centre of the fore-arm and divides into two branches, the median basilic and median cephalic, which pass obliquely inwards and outwards respectively, to assist in forming the basilic and cephalic veins. Piercing the deep fascia near the centre of the bend of the elbow is the profunda vein, which joins the median near its point of bifurcation, and forms a communication between the vence comites of the arteries of the fore-arm and the super- ficial veins, the direction of the current of blood varying in different subjects. The Anterior and Posterior Ulnar Veins (Fig. 5, 12) end on the inner side of the fore-arm in a single trunk, which unites with the median basilic to form the basilic vein. The Basilic Vein (Fig. 5, 10) runs up the inner side of the arm to about its middle, where it pierces the deep fascia and becomes the axillary vein, receiving, at a variable point, the venae comites of the brachial artery. To the inner side of the basilic vein, and about an inch above the condyle is a lymphatic gland of small size.THE MEDIAN CEPHALIC VEIN. 21 Fig. 5. The Radial Vein (Fig. 5, 11) ascends on the outer side to join the median cephalic and form the Cephalic Vein (5), which passes up the outer side of the arm, between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and has already been traced to its termination in the axillary vein. The Median Basilic Vein has important relations, since it lies su- perficially to the brachial artery, and crosses over or under the internal cutaneous nerve. It is the vessel usually selected for venisection on account of its size ; and protection is afforded to the artery beneath by the interposition of a process of fascia (bicipital or semilunar), which is connected with the tendon of the biceps, and may now be defined. The Median Cephalic Vein is of smaller size and crosses the tendon of the biceps, close to the outer side of which, and beneath the vein, the External Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 5, 9) makes its appearance and supplies the adjacent parts. Above and to the outer side of the external cutaneous nerve will be found two external cutaneous branches of the Fig. 5.—Superficial dissection of the arm (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

Close to the deltoid may he found one or two cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve (3). The deep fascia of the arm is sufficiently seen in following the superficial vessels and nerves. It is continuous with the tascia of the axilla and fore-arm, and is attached to ridges ahove the condyles of the humerus, forming the external and internal intermuscular septa, which give attachment to muscular fibres. The internal is the stronger, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna arteries. The external is pierced by the nmsculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. [The muscles of the front of the arm are now to be cleaned together with the vessels and nerves, but the fascia on the upper part of the muscles of the fore-arm need not be disturbed.] The Biceps (Fig. 6, 7) is the superficial muscle of the upper arm, and arises by two heads which generally unite in the upper third of the arm, but occasionally remain distinct nearly to their insertion. The long or outer head cannot be fully traced at present, smce it arises Within the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint from the top of the glenoid cavity, and also from the glenoid ligament. Traversing the joint and enclosed in a tube of synovial membrane, the tendon enters the bicipital groove of the humerus, and is seen to emerge from the capsular ligament and lie upon the tendon of the latissimus, and between the insertions of the pectoralis major and teres major muscles. The short or inner head arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, in common with, but to the outer side of, the coraco- brachial, • and the two heads unite to form a large fleshy beUy. The fibres converge to a broad tendon, from which, immediately above the elbow-joint, an expansion, called the bicipital or semilunar fascia is given off to join the fascia on the upper and inner part of the fore-arm (Fig. 8, 16). This must be divided in order to follow the tendon of the biceps, which passes deeply to be inserted into the back of the bicipital tubercle of the radius, a bursa being placed between the tendon and the upper smooth surface of the tubercle. The tendon becomes flattened near its insertion, and is twisted so that its outer edge becomes anterior. The action of the biceps is to supinate the fore-arm, and then flex it upon the upper arm (as m drawing a cork), being a good example of force applied to a lever of the third order. Its action as an abductor of the upper arm is very slight. The Coraco-brachialis (Fig. 6, 6) arises from the tip of theTHE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 23 Fig. 6. coracoid process, in common with, but to the inner side of, the short head of the biceps, from the tendinous upper part of which it also takes origin. It is generally pierced by the external cutaneous nerve, and is inserted on the inner side of the shaft of the humerus about its middle, and exactly opposite the insertion of the deltoid. It adducts and ilexes the humerus. The Brachialis anticus (Fig. 8, n), arises from the front of the shaft of the humerus in its lower half; it has two slips of ■origin, which embrace the insertion of the deltoid, and the fibres have also an ex- tensive attachment to the internal inter- muscular septum, and a smaller one to the upper part of the external intermuscular septum above the supinator longus. It is inserted into a triangular surface on the front of the coronoid process of the ulna, •covering the front of the elbow joint. It is the direct flexor of the fore-arm upon the upper arm. The biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachi- alis anticus are supplied by the external or musculo-cutaneous nerve; and the brachialis anticus has an additional supply from the musculo-spiral nerve, which is •close to its outer border, lying deeply be- tween it and the supinator longus. The Brachial Artery (Fig. 8, 14) is the direct continuation of the axillary, and extends from the lower border of the teres major to the point of bifurcation into radial and ulnar arteries, which is usually a quarter of an inch below the bend of the elbow. The artery is superficial, or at least crossed by no muscle, in the whole of its course, and it gradually turns from the inner side of the arm to the middle of the bend of the elbow. ' In front it has the skin and fascia, with the basilic vein at the lower Fig. 6.—Muscles of the anterior aspect of the upper arm (from Wilson). 1. Coracoid process of the scapula. 2.

Behind it has first the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda vessels, which separate it from the long head of the triceps, and then rests upon a small portion of the internal head of the triceps ; next, on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis ; and afterwards upon the brachialis anticus for the rest of its course. To the outer side is the median nerve, with the coraco-brachialis muscle for a short distance, and afterwards the biceps muscle, which is the guide to the vessel in applying a ligature. To the inner side is the ulnar nerve as far as the internal inter- muscular septum, and afterwards, from a varying point, the median nerve, which continues in close relation to the vessel for the rest of its course. The basilic vein lies to the inner side of the artery in the upper part, after piercing the deep fascia. Surgery.—To tie the brachial artery (Fig. 1). An incision, three inches long, is to be made close to and exposing the inner edge of the biceps in the middle third of the arm. A little dissection parallel to Fig. 7. the muscle will expose the median nerve, and the artery will be found in close relation to it, and generally to its outer side in this position, but this will vary in different bodies. The needle is to be passed from the nerve, care being taken of the venae comites. When the brachial artery is tied, the circulation in the limb will be maintained by .the anastomoses between the branches of the artery above and below the ligature, viz., of the superior profunda, and possibly of the inferior profunda above, with the anastomotica magna, and with the recurrent branches of the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries below.

The Branches of the "brachial artery are— 1. Muscular, arising at various points to supply the adjacent, muscles. 2.

The Superior profunda which comes off from the inner side of the artery, just "below the teres major, and immediately joining the musculo-spiral nerve, accompanies it between the outer and, under cover of the long- head, round the humerus to the outer side. It now may he seen with the nerve between the bra- chialis anticus and supinator longus in front of the elbow, where it anastomoses with the radial recurrent artery. It gives off muscular branches (principally to the triceps), one long branch running to the anconeus and back of the elbow, which will be Fig. 8.—Deep dissection of the front of the upper arm (front'Hirschfeld and Leveille).

The Inferior profunda, which arises at a variahle distance below the preceding, or in common with it, and passes with the ulnar nerve, behind the internal intermuscular septum. It runs with the nerve to the groove between the inner condyle and the olecranon, and there joins the posterior ulnar recurrent artery. 5. The Anastomotic, which arises an inch and a half above the elbow and runs directly inwards, piercing the internal intermuscular septum and supplying the parts about the elbow. It anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries, and gives a branch to join the superior profunda behind the humerus. Irregularities of the Brachial Artery.—The point of bifurcation is occasionally much higher than, the bend of the elbow, so that two large vessels may be found side by side in any part of the arm from this cause, or from an extra branch (generally the radial) being given off high up. Vasa aberrantia, or irregular branches connecting the brachial or axillary vessels with either radial or ulnar arteries, are also occasionally found. The two profunda arteries not uncom- monly arise together, and occasionally there is an axis common to all the branches of the brachial. Venae Comites are in close relation with the brachial artery, and receive twigs corresponding to its branches : they unite with the axillary vein. Nerves of the Arm. The Median Nerve (Fig. 8, 6) is derived from the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus by two roots, which embrace the axillary artery in the third part of its course. The nerve aftenvards lies to the outer side of the axillary artery for a short distance, and continues in the same relation to the brachial artery for about half its length; then, crossing either over or under that vessel, the median nerve lies to its inner side, and continues in the same relation to the bend of the elbow. The median nerve ordinarily gives off no branch in the upper arm, but occasionally communicates with the external cutaneous nerve. . The External Cutaneous Nerve (musculo-cutaneous) (Fig. 8, i) arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus in common with the outer head of the median, and lies to the outer side of the median nerve and the axillary vessels for a short distance. It then pierces the coraco-brachialis obliquely (hence, n. pcrforans Casseni), andTHE BEND OF THE ELBOW. 27 having given a branch to that muscle,-it lies between the biceps and the brachialis anticus, both of which muscles it supplies. It finally becomes cutaneous at the outer side of the tendon of the biceps just above the bend of the elbow, where it has been already seen to lie beneath the median-cephalic vein. The Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 8, 8) arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and lies close to the inner side of the axillary vessels, and afterwards in a similar relation with the upper part of the brachial artery. It leaves that vessel about the middle of the arm, piercing, and then running behind, the internal intermuscular septum, accompanied by the inferior profunda artery, to the interval between the internal condyle and the olecranon process. The ulnar nerve gives no branch in the upper arm. The Musculo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 8, 13) is derived from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and lies at first behind the axillary artery and upon the subscapularis muscle with the circumflex nerve. It then rests upon the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and, after giving off a cutaneous branch to the inner side of the arm, winds backwards around the humerus, lying against the inner head of the triceps and disappearing between it and the outer head of that muscle. Branches supplying the triceps can now be seen, and in a subsequent dissection the nerve will be followed through the fibres of that muscle. Its lower portion is now visible between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, to both of which and to the extensor carpi radialis longior, a branch may be traced; the division into radial and posterior interosseous nerves is also to be dissected out. The Bend op the Elbow. {The boundaries of the space in front of the elbow are now to be exposed by removing the fascia from the muscles of the fore-arm to the extent to which the skin has been already reflected, the tendons of the biceps and brachialis are to be thoroughly cleaned, and the fibres of the supinator brevis in the floor of the space carefully dissected.] The Triangle in front of the Elbow (Fig. 9) is bounded above by an imaginary line drawn across the arm above the condyles, and below the apex is formed by the junction of the pronator teres and supinator longus two inches below the joint. The external boundary is the supinator longus, the internal the pronator teres, whilst the floor is formed, first, by the lower part of the brachialis anticus, and afterwards by the oblique fibres of the supinator brevis, which however cannot be seen until the space is opened up. The relations28 THE BEND OF THE ELBOW. of the superficial veins and nerves have been already examined (p. 20), and the contents of the space are now seen to he (1) the median nerve, (2) the brachial artery, and (3) the tendon of the biceps, which lie in that order from within outwards * The median nerve (2) lies nearly verti- cally in the space, and disap- pears between the heads of the pronator teres : the brachial, artery (4) usually bifurcates into radial and ulnar upon the insertion of the brachialis anticus, the radial resting against the tendon of the biceps and supinator brevis, and the ulnar lying upon the brachialis till it disappears beneath the pronator teres. The twisting of the biceps; tendon has already been re- ferred to. By slightly displacing the supinator longus outwards, the musculo-spiral nerve will be seen lying between it and the brachialis anticus and dividing into radial and pos- terior interosseous nerves ; but this nerve is not, strictly speaking, in the triangle. The radial nerve may be traced for a short distance upon the stipulator brevis, whilst the posterior interosseous can be seen entering its fibres. It is supposed that by the time the dissection of the bend of the elbow is finished the subject will be turned, in which case the student of the arm should dissect the first two layers of the muscles of the back (see Dissection of the Back), proceeding afterwards with the following dissections. If necessary, however, the dissection * Artificial Memory, NAT. Pig. 9.—The bend of the elbow (from University College Museum). 1. Biceps. 5. Anastomosis of superior profunda 2. Median nerve. 3.

Since in some dissecting-rooms the dissector of the arm has no part in the back, the following directions are given for the removal of the limb :— [The two superficial layers of the muscles of the back comprise the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboidei, and levator anguli scapulae. These having been divided, the suprascapular artery and nerve and omo-hyoid muscle are to be traced to the upper border of the scapula, and the posterior scapular artery followed between the rhomboidei .and the back of the serratus magnus. If the clavicle has been already divided in the dissection of the neck, the scapula can now be drawn away from the ribs and will be seen to be attached solely by the serratus magnus, between which and the ribs is a quantity of loose areolar tissue which enables the bone to glide smoothly upon the thorax. The serratus magnus having been divided, and the clavicle cut at its middle if still entire, the axillary vessels and nerves are to be severed after being tied together, and the entire limb removed from the trunk.] Paets about the Scapula. [The limb having been placed on the table, it is advisable to identify again the several insertions of muscles on the scapula, cutting each muscle to about an inch in length.] The trapezius extends along the whole length of the 'upper border of the spine of the scapula and for the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle. The omo-hyoid arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch and from the transverse ligament. The levator anguli scapulae is inserted into that part of the base of the scapula which is above the spine, the rhomboideus minor into the part opposite the spine, and the rhomboideus major into the base below the spine, by means of a tendinous arch to which the muscular fibres are attached. The serratus magnus is inserted into •the inner surface of the base of the scapula for its whole length, but the fibres are much thicker at the upper and lower angles than in the centre. The small insertion of the pectoralis minor is attached to the inner border of the coracoid process, which also gives origin to the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps. [A small block is now to be placed beneath the lower border of the^scapula so as to put the deltoid on the stretch, and the remainder of its fibres are then to be cleaned, notice being taken of one or two small branches of the circumflex nerve which turn round its posterior border, and of a few descending acromial branches from the superfi- cial cervical plexus (Fig. 5,. i) winch supply the skin of the shoulder.]SO PARTS ABOUT THE SCAPULA. The Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 10, 6) arises from the outer half or third of the anterior border of the clavicle and from the lower border of the acromion and spine of the scapula. Its strong coarse fibres converge to a point, and are inserted into a rough surface of a triangu- lar shape on the outer side of the humerus in the middle of the shait, being embraced by the bifid origin of the brachials anticus, and closely connected with the insertion of the pectorahs major The action of the deltoid as a whole is to raise the arm to the level of the shoulder, i.e., to abduct'the humerus; but the anterior fibres will assist in flexion and the posterior in extension of the shoulder-joint. It is an example of power applied to a lever of the third order, and is supplied by the circumflex nerve. FThe deltoid is to be divided near its origin and turned down the circumflex vessels and nerve being preserved.

Aove and below it removed, the humerus being rotated inwards to put their fibres on the stretch.] The Parts beneath the Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 10) are-the Infra- spinatus, Teres Minor, and Teres Major muscles, and the long head of the Triceps, with the head and neck of the humerus. The quadrilateral and triangular intermuscular spaces referred to in the dissection of the axilla (p. 16), can now be seen from behtnd, when the quadrilateral or outer one will be found to be Wed by the teres major, teres minor, humerus, and long head of triceps ; the triangular or inner one, by the teres major teres minor, and long head of triceps ; and the vessels and nerve they transmit are now to be traced out. (A triangular interval between the teres major and the long and external heads of the triceps must not be mistaken for this latter space.) The posterior circumflex artery and circumflex nerve pass through the quadrilateral space ; he dorsalis scapula artery lies in the triangular space, and the large musculo-sprral nerve with the brachial artery will be seen between the heads of the '"The Supra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 10, 3) occupies the supraspinal foS Srom the greater part of the fossa itself from£ upper surface of the spine, and from the fascia covering the muscle, the tendon passes beneath the acromion to be inserted into the _ort facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and slightly into the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint.

It is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint, being blended there with the supra-spinatus and teres minor.

The Suprascapular Nerve (from the 5th and 6th nerves of the brachial plexus) (Fig. 10, i) passes through the suprascapular notch and beneath the ligament, and is distributed to the supra- and infra- spinatus muscles. The Omo-hyoid Muscle arises from about half an inch of the superior border of the scapula immediately behind the suprascapular notch, and from the transverse or posterior ligament over it. Its relations and insertion are seen in the dissection of the neck. [The limb is to be turned over and the humerus rotated outwards to put the fibres of the subscapularis on the stretch ; they should then be cleaned, care being taken of the subscapular nerves entering the muscle. The axillary vessels and nerves should be tied to the coracoid process, so as to bring them as nearly as may be into then- proper positions.] The Subscapularis Muscle (Fig. 6, 4) is covered in by a thin fascia, and has been already seen to form part of the posterior wall of the axilla. It arises from the whole of the venter scapulae except the part to which the serratus magnus is attached and the portion nearest the neck of the bone, and has several tendinous septa between its fibres which are attached to the ridges on the surface of the bone. It is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus and the bone below it for an inch, and into the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, a large bursa intervening, which not unfrequently communicates with the cavity of the joint. The subscapularis is an internal rotator and adductor of the humerus, and is supplied by the short subscapular nerves. The most important action of the supra- and infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles is their combination to keep the head of the humerus in its proper relation to the glenoid cavity, and ■ thus prevent dislocation. In the post-mortem relaxed condition of the parts, the head of the humerus can be drawn away from the glenoid cavity to the full extent of the loose capsular ligament. The Subscapular Nerves (Fig. 4) are branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and are three in number. The long subscapular nerve has been already seen in the axilla, and can still be traced to the latissimus dorsi ; the short subscapular nerves (upper and lower) are now to be followed, the upper to the subscapularis muscle, the lower to give a branch to the subscapularis and supply the teres major.

The outer head arises from immediately below the insertion of the teres minor into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and from the outer side of the posterior aspect of the bone, as far down as the mus- culo-spiral groove ; also slightly from the external intermuscular septum, which intervenes be- tween it and the deltoid. The inner head arises from the whole of the posterior aspect of the humerus below the insertion of the teres major and the musculo- spiral groove, to within half an inch of the elbow-joint on the inner side, and extending to the back of the condyle on the outer side.

The Superior Profunda branch of the brachial artery closely accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve around the bone, and supplies the triceps in its course. At the outer edge of the triceps it gives ■off a large superficial branch which runs clown to the elbow; it then divides into two branches, one going to the back of the elbow beneath the triceps to anastomose with the interosseous recurrent and inferior profunda arteries; the other running between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to anastomose with the radial recurrent artery. The Front op the Fore-arm. [One incision is to be made down the middle of the fore-arm, and another at right angles to it across the front of the wrist, and the flaps of skin are to be turned to each side.] The Cutaneous "Veins (Fig. 13) will be found in the superficial fascia, and can be defined without injury to the nerves. The Anterior Ulnar Vein (10) is pretty regular in its course, and will be found to commence in one or two small branches about the wrist ; then running along the inner side of the fore-arm, it joins the Posterior Ulnar Vein (8) near the elbow and assists in forming the basilic vein. The Median Vein (9) is seldom in the centre of the arm at first, but commences near the root of the thumb, coursing obliquely to the centre of the arm near the bend of the elbow, where it is joined by the profunda vein and divides into median basilic and median ■cephalic branches (p. 21). The Radial Vein (7) commences at the back of the hand, and appears on the outer side of the fore-arm about its middle. It has been seen to unite with the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein (p. 21). Besides these named veins there are numerous smaller branches which assist, and occasionally take the place of, the larger ones. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 13) are now to be followed out. The Internal cutaneous nerve (4) can be traced to the whole of the inner side of the fore-arm, the branches winding round to the back of the limb. It sometimes forms a junction with— A cutaneous branch of the Ulnar nerve (12), which may, with care be found piercing the fascia about a hand's breadth above the wristFRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 38 Fig. 13. close to the edge of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, which can be readily felt. . .

The Deep Fascia is now to be cleaned, and will be found to be continuous with the deep fascia of the arm above, and with the an- nular ligament below. It gives- numerous intermuscular septa in the fore-arm, which in a thin sub- ject are seen as white lines, running- more or less in the length of the limb. [The muscles from the internal condyle are to be exposed by re- moving the deep fascia from the front of the arm, and they are then to be cleaned carefully in the direc- tion of their fibres.] Fi°- 13.—Cutaneous dissection of the- °" front of the fore-arm (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Muscles (Fig. 14) from the inner condyle are five in number, four being flexors of the carpus and fingers, and one a, pronator of the fore-arm. Beginning from the outer side, their relative positions are :—1, pronator teres; 2, flexor carpi radialis ; 3, palmaris longus (which may be absent); 4, flexor sub- limis digitorum ; 5, flexor carpi ulnaris. All these muscles have a common origin from (1) the internal condyle, (2) the fascia of the fore-arm, and (3) the inter-muscular septa derived from it; but three of them, viz., the pronator teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris, have extra bony attachments. The Pronator Radii Teres (Fig. 14, 4) arises from the internal condyle above the other muscles; from the fascia of the fore- arm over it; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the flexor carpi radi- alis. Its second head is from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna outside the origin of the flexor sublimis, the median nerve lying between the two heads. It is inserted by a broad tendon into the middle of the outer side of the radius, immediately below the supinator brevis. It pronates the hand by rolling the radius on the ulna, and flexes the elbow, and is supplied by the median nerve. The Flexor Carpi Radialis (Fig. 14, 5) arises from the internal condyle in common with the remaining muscles; from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and from the intermuscular septa between it and Fig. 14.—Superficial muscles of the 1.

It is a flexor of the carpus and abductor of the hand, and is supplied by the median nerve. The Palmaris Longus (Fig. 14, 6) arises from the common attach- ment to the inner condyle; from the fascia of the fore-arm; and from the intermuscular septa on each side of it. Its long and narrow tendon passes superficially to be inserted into the strong palmar fascia in the centre of the hand, and slightly into that over the muscles of the thumb. It serves to make tense the palmar fascia, and thus protect the deep tissnes of the palm, and may slightly flex the hand when largely developed. It is supplied by the median nerve. _ The palmaris longus is frequently wanting, but it is occasionally largely developed, the whole length of the tendon being covered with strong muscular fibres connected with the flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (Fig. 14, 8) arises from the common attachment to the internal condyle j from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the adjacent muscle. It has an additional aponeurotic origin from the inner side of the olecranon process and from the inner side of the posterior ridge of the ulna for two-thirds of its length, this latter origin being common to itself and the flexor profundus digitorum. The muscle . is inserted by a flattened tendon (upon which the muscular fibres extend nearly to the wrist) into the pisiform bone, and slightly into the fifth metacarpal bone and the annular ligament Between the two origins of this muscle the ulnar nerve enters he fore-arm, after winding close behind the internal condyle, and both ulnar artery and ne?ve will be seen beneath a process of the deep fascia close to the outer side of the tendon near the wrist. It is a flexor of the carpus and adductor of the hand, and is the only one ot either the flexors or extensors of the carpus which is inserted directly into one of its bones. It is supplied by the ulnar nerve.

To its outer side in addition it has the radial nerve, which in the upper third of the arm is at some little distance, in the middle third is in close relation, and in the lower third quits the vessel altogether by passing beneath the supinator longus.

It runs forward, and generally beneath some of the fibres of the muscles of the thumb, to complete the superficial palmar arch formed by the ulnar artery. 4 The anterior carpal is a small branch which runs across the wrist beneath the deep tendons, to join a corresponding branch ot the ulnar artery at the level of the lower border of the pronator qUSurterv (Fig. 7).-The radial artery is readily tied, about an inch above^he wrist, by an incision one inch and a half midway between the tendons of the flexor carpi.radialis and supinator lonaus, when the vessel will be found lying immediately benea h the deep fascia with the venae comites in close connection, but with no nerve near.

It arises from the internal condyle of the humerus and slightly from the internal lateral ligament of the elbow ; from the intermuscular septa between it and the more superficial muscles; from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna inside the pronator teres ; and from the whole of the oblique line on the front of the radius and part of the anterior border of this bone. Between the origins from the ulna and the radius is the median nerve. The muscle ends in four tendons, of which the two to the second and third fingers lie in front of those to the first and fourth fingers ; all pass under the annular ligament and through the palm of the hand to the second phalanges of the four fingers. The sheath of the finger which is exposed should be laid open along the centre, when it will be found to be thick opposite each phalanx (lig'amentum vaginale), but thin at each joint, and to be attached to the lateral ridges on the first and second phalanges and to the base of the third phalanx. The sheath is lined by a synovial membrane which is continued into the palm and from which bands (vinculo, vasculosa) pass between the flexor tendons and the phalanges. The tendon of the flexor sublimis (perforatus) will be seen to be flattened on the first phalanx and split to give passage to the tendon of the flexor profundus (perforans), the two slips of the flexor sublimis being; inserted into the sides of the second phalanx, and the tendon of the flexor profundus into the base of the third phalanx. The flexor sublimis is a flexor of the phalanges and then of the carpus, and is- supplied by the median nerve. The position of the ulnar artery, between the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the innermost tendon of the flexor sublimis in the lower half of the fore-arm, is now to be noticed, and by a slight separation of the tendons the -ulnar nerve can be seen lying close to the ulnar side of the artery. This is the point where the ulnar artery is usually tied. [The flexor sublimis is now to be divided near its origins and turned down without injuring the median nerve, from which a branch may be traced to the deep surface of the muscle.] The Deep Muscles (Fig. 16) of the fore -arm are the flexor longus. pollicis to the radial side, the flexor profundus digitorum to the ulnar side, and the pronator quadratus, a small square muscle with transverse fibres, to be seen above the carpus by drawing aside the tendons. These are now to be cleaned, all vessels and nerves being carefully preserved.FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 44 Fig. 16. The Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 16, 5) arises from the whole of the anterior surface of the radius between the oblique line and the at- tachment of the pronator quadratus, and from the outer half of the interosseous membrane in nearly its whole length. It veiy generally has a small additional origin, by a slip of very variable size, from the outer side of the coro- noid process of the ulna. A single round tendon passes beneath the annular ligament and through the palm of the hand, between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, to be inserted into the terminal phalanx of the thumb. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum (per- forans) (Fig. 16, 4) arises from the anterior surface of the ulna between the coronoid pro- cess (which it embraces) and the origin of the pronator quadratus, and from the adjacent half of the interosseous membrane ; also from the upper two-thirds of the inner surface of the ulna, extending to the olecranon process and the posterior border of the bone, to which an aponeurosis is attached from which some of the fibres arise. The muscle ends in four tendons (that to the index finger alone being quite separate in the fore-arm), which pass beneath the annular ligament, and after aiving origin to the lumbricales muscles in the palm, pierce the tendons of the flexor sublimis opposite the first phalanges, and are inserted into the bases of the third phalanges of the four fingers. The two preceding muscles are direct flexors f 4*1 fhTiTYi-h and finders, and afterwards of the carpus. The flexor X^W^lSwV mediannerve;thefle,oxprofanduS the fore-ami (from "Wilson). 6.

The Pronator Quadratus (Fig. 16, 6) is the only muscle in the arm whose fibres are transverse. It arises from a somewhat oval surface on the front of the ulna below the origin of the flexor pro- fundus, and is inserted into the whole of the front of the radius, below the attachment of the flexor longus pollicis. This muscle is a powerful pronator of the fore-arm, and is supplied by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. The Ulnar Artery (Fig. 17, 16) arises from the bifurcation of the brachial artery at the bend of the elbow, and at once takes an oblique course inwards beneath the median nerve and four of the muscles arising from the internal condyle (pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitomm). It lies first upon the insertion of the brachialis anticus, and then upon the flexor profundus di»itorum for the remainder of its course in the fore-arm, being- bound down by a process of deep fascia. It is joined in the middle third of its course by the ulnar nerve, which lies to its ulnar side for the rest of its course in the fore-arm. In the lower third of the fore- arm both artery and nerve lie comparatively superficially between the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor sublimis (but slightly overlapped by the former), until they both pass over the annular ligament into the hand. Two venae comites are in close relation with the artery. Surgery (Fig. 7).—The ulnar artery is easily reached in its lower part by an incision two inches long upon the outer edge of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The tendon being drawn a little inwards,'it would only be necessary to divide the intermuscular layer of the deep fascia in order to expose the vessel with the nerve to its ulnar side. The operation for tying the vessel in its upper part between the flexor muscles is impracticable on the living body, but the vessel may be reached on the subject by separating the flexor carpi ulnaris from the flexor sublimis digitorum until the ulnar nerve is exposed, when the artery will be found to its outer side. When the ulnar artery is tied, the circulation is mainly carried on by the radial through the palmar arches, and also by the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, which anastomose at the back of the fore-arm. Branches.—1. The Anterior ulnar recurrent will be found between the brachialis anticus and pronator teres, running up in front of the elbow joint to join the anastomotica. 2. The Posterior ulnar recurrent is to be followed beneath the46 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris to the back of the prominent internal condyle, where, after passing between the heads ot the flexor carpi ulnaris, it runs in the groove occupied by the nlnar nerve, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries. " 3 The Interosseous artery is a short trunk arising about two inches from the commencement of the artery, which is directed backwards to the interosseous space, where it subdivides into anterior and pos- terior interosseous branches. The posterior interosseous passes between the radius and ulna to the back of the arm, where it will be dissected. The anterior interosseous is to be foUowed down the front of the interosseous membrane, where it will be found lying with a branch of the median nerve between the flexor longus pollicis and flexor profundus digitorum, until it disappears beneath the pronator Ladratus to reach the back of the wrist. The anterior interosseous arterv "ives off numerous muscular branches ; a median branch to accompany the median nerve (sometimes of large size) ; and two nutritious arteries to the radius and ulna, winch are directed towards Carpal arteries, anterior and posterior, supply the front and back of the carpus, and anastomose with corresponding branches from ^TheMeLn Nerve (Figs. 15 and 17) enters the fore-arm between the heads of the pronator teres, and then passing between the origins of the flexor sublimis digitorum, crosses the ulnar artery to lie between the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus muscles. It is nlaced superficially between the flexor tendons near the wrist, and nasses with them beneath the annular ligament into the hand. P Brancnes.-The median nerve supplies all^he muscles of the front of the fore-arm except the flexor carpi ulnaris and half he flexor profundus, in the following manner :-As soon as it enters he fore-arni it gives branches to the pronator teres, flexor carpi radiahs, flexor-Hi-is digitorum, and palmaris longus, and, after: crossing S a inl™r arterv gives off the anterior interosseous nerve (Fig. 17 25). ^Z^n the front of the interosseous membrane giving Whes to the flexor longus pollicis and tlie outer half of the p oWus\ligitorum, and then beneath the pronator quadratus gffi supples) to'the front of the wrist-joint, where it gives a branch to the articulation. as will be seen in tlie dissection of the back of the band.THE ULNAR NERVE. 47 A cutaneous palmar "branch.

The Superficial Veins (Fig. 18) of the hand form an arch across the back of the metacarpus, which joins the radial and posterior ulnar veins at its extremities; the veins of the fore-arm wind round the limb to join the radial and ulnar veins respectively, and one or two branches form communications be- tween them and across the back ot the fore-arm.

The Extensor Communis Digitorum (Fig. 19, 8) arises from the external condyle with the preceding muscles; from the fascia of the fore-arm, and from the intermuscular septa on each side of it. It ends in three tendons, which pass through the fourth divi- sion of the annular ligament with the extensor indicis and, the innermost having subdivided, the four tendons thus formed are inserted into the fingers in the following way:—Opposite the metacarpophalangeal joint each tendon sends slips to both sides of the base of the first phalanx, which are firmly bound to the phalanx and the metacarpophalangeal articu- lation ; it then expands upon the phalanx, being joined by slips from the lumbricales and interossei muscles j this expansion is stronger at the margins than in the middle; and its sides are prolonged to the third phalanx, whilst the middle triangular portion is attached to the base of the second phalanx. This division is artificial and must be made with the scalpel, since the three parts are originally united. The tendon of the extensor indicis joins the ulnar side of the first or outer- most tendon at the first phalanx. The three innermost tendons of the extensor are joined Fig. 19.—Superficial muscles of the back of fore-aim (from Wilson). 1. Biceps. 2. Brachialis anticus. 3.

The posterior interosseous nerve piercing the muscle is to be carefully preserved and its branches traced to the extensors.] The Supinator Brevis (Fig. 20, 5) has very oblique fibres, which are covered at the upper part by a tendinous expansion or inter- muscular septum, from which some of them take their origin. It arises from the external condyle ; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow ; from the orbicular ligament of the radius ; from the triangular space below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and from the margin of bone below it as far as the attachment of the anconeus. Its fibres sweep round the radius and are inserted into the outer and back part of the neck of that bone above the oblique lines, with the exception of the bicipital tubercle and the posterior surface of bone above and below it. The supinator is pierced by the posterior inter- osseous nerve (which supplies it), and is separated from the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis by the posterior interosseous artery. It is a powerful supinator of the radius on the ulna. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis (Fig. 20, 6) is usually the only one of the special extensors of the thumb which has an origin from both bones of the forearm, though occasionally the next muscle has a double origin. It arises from the middle of the pos- terior surface of the radius for about two inches, the origin reaching across the bone from the interosseous line to the attachments of the supinator brevis and pronator teres ; from a corresponding portion of the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane ; and from two inches of the middle of the outer side of the posterior surface of the ulna, between the attachments of the supinator brevis and anconeus above, and the extensor secundi internodii below. The muscle " crops out" between the extensors of the carpus and fingers, and having crossed the extensor carpi radialis longior and the brevior obliquely, it passes on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius, through the first division of the annular ligament and over the radial artery, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb (1st metacarpal bone), sending a slip to the trapezium and the short muscles of the thumb. The Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis (Fig. 20, 7) arises from the back of the radius immediately below the extensor ossis meta- carpi pollicis and close to the interosseous line, for a space two inches long and half an inch wide; also from the radial half of the inter- osseous membrane for a corresponding distance. Its tendon lies to the ulnar side of the tendon of the extensor of the metacarpal bone in its whole course, passing through the same division of the annular54 BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. Fig. 20. ligament, and is prolonged to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. .. The Extensor Secundi Internodii Fol- licis (Fig. 20, 8) arises from the middle of the outer half of the posterior surface of the ulna (between the origins of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis above, and the indicator below), and from the ulnar half of the cor- responding portion of the interosseous mem- brane. Its tendon becomes superficial just above the annular ligament, through which it passes very obliquely in a separate division (the third) ; then crossing the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and the radial artery, it runs along the ulnar side of the extensor primi internodii to be inserted into the base of the terminal phalanx of the thumb. This muscle varies very much in.size. The Extensor Indicis (indicator) (Fig. 20, 9) arises from the posterior surface of the ulna below the preceding muscle (by the size of which its attachment is influenced), and slightly from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon is covered by those of the common extensor, and running through the fourth division of the annular ligament with them, is inserted into the common expansion on the back of the first phalanx of the fore-finger. The actions of the special extensors are im- plied by their names. They are all supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve. _ , J „e Ar+pw CFio\ 22, 8) arising from The Posterior Interosseous Aiteiy ^iB- **> ) » ine jrostenur *j artery, reaches the back ot the interosseous, a branch oi .lie umar «ute y, Fig. 20-Deep muscles of the hack-of fore-arm (from Wilson) 8.

It appears between the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (usually), giving muscular branches to the extensor muscles and a recurrent branch to the elboW joint; and terminates by joining the pos- terior carpal arteries and also the terminal branch of the anterior in- terosseous artery (id), which will be found to reach the back of the arm by piercing the interosseous mem- brane immediately above the lower end of the radius. The recurrent (6) branch runs upon or through the supinator brevis to the outer and back part of the elbow, where it anastomoses with the superior pro- funda and recurrent radial arteries. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve (Fig. 21, 9) is a division of the musculo-spiral, which has been already seen to divide on the outer Pig. 21.—Dissection of the musculo-spiral nerve and its branches (from Hirsch- feld and Leveille). 1.

The posterior interosseous nerve can now be traced running obliquely in the fibres of the supinator brevis, and at its lower border breaking up into muscular branches and an articular branch to the wrist lhe muscular branches supply the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnans the three special extensors of the thumb and the indicator ; and the supinator brevis is supplied by a branch or two as the nerve passes through it, and must be divided to see them. The arhcular branch to the wrist is the continuation of the nerve, and reaches the interosseous membrane between the extensors of the first and second phalanges of the thumb ; passing beneath the latter muscle it rims to the back ot the carpus, beneath the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum, where a gangliform enlargement may be found. „..,,, The Radial Artery at the wrist (Fig. 22, 18).-After leaving the front of the lower end of the radius (p. 40) the radial artery lies a-ainst the external lateral ligament of the wrist-jomt, and beneath the extensors of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the thumb. It then winds over the back of the carpus, to the interval between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and fore-finger, where it is crossed by the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, and lastly passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the abductor indicis (first dorsal interosseous muscle). The Branches (Fig. 22) of the radial artery at the wrist very commonly vary, but should be five in number. 1 The Posterior carpal (17) is a small branch which runs trans- versely close upon the bone immediately below the annular ligament, to ioin the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar and form an arch. From this two dorsal interosseous arteries are given, which run on the third and fourth interosseous muscles, and receive the perforating arteries which appear between their heads of origin. 2 The Metacarpal (20) is the first dorsal interosseous artery, and closely resembles the others. It runs on the second interosseous muscle, and at the root of the fingers often joins the digital branch from the front of the hand. . 3 and 4 The Dorsales pollicis (24) are two small arteries which are distributed 011 the metacarpal bone of the thumb; one is often wanting 5 The Dorsales indicis (22) is a similar branch, which runs along the metacarpal bone of the index finger. This is frequently repW by a large arterv which runs along the metacarpal bone and divides into branches to the fore-finger and thumb, being m act the radialis indicis, a branch of the radial in the palm, arising earlier than usual.57 POSTERIOR ANNULAR LIGAMENT. The Posterior carpal branch (Fig, be found appearing beneath the extensor carpi ulnaris, and hav- ing completed the arch formed by the posterior carpal of the radial, it ends in a branch to the ulnar side of the fifth metacarpal bone. The Posterior Annular Li- gament (Fig. 19, 15) is attached to the radius externally, and to the cuneiform and pisiform bones internally. It has six subdivi- sions, which should be carefully examined and compared with the grooves on the bones. The first division corresponds to the groove on the outer side of the styloid process of the Pig. 22.—Arteries of the back of the fore-arm (drawn by Gr. E. L. Pearse). 1. Inferior profunda. 2.

It is supplied by the ulnar nerve, and is often absent. [The central portion of the palmar fascia is to be detached from the annular ligament and turned clown, care being taken not to injure the vessels and nerves which are close beneath, and these are to be cleaned.] The Superficial Palmar Arch (Fig. 15, 34) is the direct con- tinuation of the ulnar artery, which reaches the hand by passing- over the annular ligament. The vessel is subject to very great variations, but if regular, forms an arch with the convexity forwards, reaching to about midway between the annular ligament and the root of the middle finger. The arch is completed on the radial side either by the superficialis voice branch of the radial artery, which generally pierces a few of the fibres of the muscles of the thumb, or more commonly by the radialis indicis (p. 67), the superficial volar being absent. From the convexity of the arch, and principally from its ulnar side, are given off four digital arteries, the first of which runs to the ulnar side of the little finger, whilst the three others bifurcate about half an inch from the web of the fingers to supply the radial side of the little finger, both sides of the ring, both sides of the middle, and the ulnar half of the index finger. These branches should be traced along the sides of the fingers, and will be found to inosculate in the pulp of the terminal phalanx, being accompanied by the digital nerves ; but the relation between them differs in the palm and in the fingers,—in the former the arteries are superficial to, in the latter they are deeper than, the nerves. Each of the three outer digital arteries at its point of bifurcation re- ceives a communicating branch from the deep arch (radial artery), and the branch to the forefinger inosculates at its tip with a branch on the other side of the finger also derived from the radial (radialis indicis). The Profunda Artery is a small communicating branch arising from the ulnar artery as soon as it has crossed the annular ligament. It passes deeply, with an accompanying branch of the ulnar nerve, between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, and will be found to complete the deep palmar arch of the radial artery. The superficial palmar arch is subject to considerable variation, one of the most common irregularities being its non-completion by the superficialis volse, in which case it generally joins the radialis indicis at the root of the incl ex-finger. The median artery from the anterior interosseous (p. 46) may be large, and join the superficial palmar arch or supply digital branches.£2 PALM OF THE HAND. the annular ligament, lying to its ulnar side, and immediately divides into a superficial and a deep portion. The deep branch (28) accom- panies the profunda branch of the ulnar artery between the muscles of the little finger, all of which it supplies, and will be seen again m the deep dissection of the palm. The superficial ^« subdivides into two digital branches which supply one and a half fingers, the iTer one tuning on the ulnar side of the little finger, and he other bifurcating at the roots of the fingers into branches for the radial side of the little and ulnar side of the rmg finger, the latter uniting with a branch of the median nerve. The digital nerves can be traced along the sides of the tendinous sheaths, lying superficially to the arteries and joining one another in the pulp of he finger, where the corpuscles of touch (Paccini) are developed like little biids noon a twig. A large branch also passes backward at the tip oi the finder to supply the matrix of the nail. The ulnar nerve gives a small branch to the palmaris brevis muscle* The Anterior Annular Ligament (Fig. 25, 1) is the broad band of fascia binding down the flexor tendons at the wrist, and is only a tl^Zl^n of the common fascia of the limb. It is attached tl scaphoid bone and to the ridge of the trapezium on the on er side and to the unciform process of the unciform bone and slightly ?o the pisiform bone on the inner side. The ulnar artery and nerve and the utaneous palmar nerves cross it, and also the tendon of the oalmaris lon«ms in part.

This tissue must be carefully dissected away. The Median Nerve (Fig. 17, 33) passes beneath the annular ligament superficially to the tendons, and divides into two trunks which subdivide into four digital nerves, to supply three and a half fingers. The first or outermost, after giving a small branch to supply some of the short muscles of the thumb, bifurcates into branches to supply the two sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb ; the second digital nerve supplies the radial side of the index-finger, after giving a small twig to the first lumbricalis muscle ; the third, after supply- ing the second lumbricalis, bifurcates near the root of the finger to supply the ulnar side of the index and the radial side of the middle fingers ; the fourth bifurcates to supply the ulnar side of the middle- finger and the radial side of the ring-finger, this last branch joining the branch from the ulnar nerve previously seen. The digital branches of each finger unite in the pulp of the terminal phalanx, and have Paccinian corpuscles developed on them like those of the ulnar nerve, and also give branches to the matrix of the nail. [The ulnar artery is to be divided beyond the origin of the pro- funda and the arch turned clown as far as possible, but the nerve may be left uncut. The median nerve is to be divided at the wrist and turned down, and the flexor tendons with the lumbricales muscles cleaned and traced to their insertions. The sheaths of the flexor tendons have been already described (p. 43), but at least one more should be laid open m order that the tendons may be well seen.] The Tendons of the Flexor Sublimis, four in number, pass beneath the annular ligament and lie immediately beneath the median nerve in the palm. Each tendon becomes somewhat flattened, and on the first phalanx splits into two portions, which are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx, giving passage to the tendons of the flexor profundus between them. The vinculo, accessoria or syno- vial slips which unite the tendons to the sheath (ligamenta longa) .and also the short elastic bands (ligamenta brevia) connecting each tendon with the front of the first phalanx, should be observed. The Tendons of the Flexor Profundus (Fig. 25, 8), also four in number, lie beneath the corresponding superficial tendons which they perforate over the first phalanges ; they then pass on to be inserted into the bases of the third phalanges. Each pair of tendons is lubricated by&a synovial sheath, that of the little finger (together with that of the flexor of the thumb) com municatmg with the general synovial cavity beneath the annular ligament already described. <*nnuiarg4 PALM OF THE HAND. The Lumbricales (Fig. 25, 7) are four little muscles connected with the deep flexor tendons, and bear some resemblance to a worm (lumbricus). The first lumbricalis, counting from the radial side and sometimes the second), arms from the radial side of a single ndon ^t the others arise by distinct slips from the ^ of two deep tendons. The four muscles end m small tendon, which wind to the radial side of the four fingers, and, passing over the Tansve se Anient of the metacarpus, are inserted into the expansion rf Z e~ tendons on the back of the first phalanges. The lum- Wks act with the interossei as flexors of the first phalanges and e^oMe second and third phalanges. The first and second have been seen to be sullied by branches of the media,. nerve ; the third and fourth receive branches of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which will be seen in the deeper dissection. The Tendon of the Plexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 2o 9) is at th11 level as the tendons of the flexor -d can b traced between the halves of the flexor brevis pollicis to the base ot he tergal phalanx of the thumb.

The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 25, 2) is a slender muscle, and is the most superficial of the series. It arises from the ridge on the trapezium, and from the annular ligament. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, with the outer half of the flexor brevis The Opponens Pollicis (Fig. 25, 3) arises from, the front of the Fig. 25. trapezium and from the annular ligament, and is inserted into the outer border of the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its action is to "oppose" the thumb to the fingers, an action peculiar to man and monke}Ts, the muscle being sometimes called the flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis. The Plexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 25, 4) consists of two por- tions at its insertion, between which the tendon of the Ions flexor is placed, one head being more or less conjoined with the adductor, and the other with the abductor pollicis. It arises from the lower part of the annular ligament, from the front of the trapezium, trapezoides and os magnum, the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis. The two heads are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and into the sesamoid bones which are developed at this Fig. 25.—Muscles of 1. Annular ligament. 2,2.

The deep arch has a slight convexity towards the fingers, and is placed upon the bases of the metacarpal bones, being completed by the deep branch of the ulnar artery. Before terminating in the deep palmar arch the radial artery gives off two branches, viz. :— 1. Princeps pollicis, a large branch of uncertain origin, and frequently arising from the radial at the back of the abductor indicis ; it passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and then bifurcates to supply both sides of the thumb superficially. 2. Raclialis indicis, which runs on the palmar aspect of the abductor indicis to the forefinger, of which it supplies the radial side, giving a branch of communication to the superficial palmar arch, and anastomosing at the tip of the finger with the digital artery derived from the superficial arch. The deep arch gives some small recurrent branches to the carpus ; three perforating arteries to the dorsum, which pass between the heads of the three inner interosseous muscles ; and three interosseous arteries which run on the three palmar interosseous muscles to the roots of the fingers, and then anastomose with the digital branches of the superficial arch at their points of bifurcation. The tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis can now be easily traced through the groove in the trapezium to its insertion into the base of ' the second metacarpal bone. The Transverse Metacarpal Ligament (Fig. 35, 14) passes in front of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and is closely connected with the sheaths of the flexor tendons. It must be divided to follow < out the palmar interossei, which pass beneath it. The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, three palmar and four dorsal. Two of the palmar interossei are readily seen, but I the adductor pollicis must be entirely detached from the middle 1 metacarpal bone in order to expose the remaining one. The Three palmar interossei (Fig. 27) are muscles placed in the ■ three metacarpal spaces between the fingers, and are numbered 1st :2nd, and 3rd from the radial side. They are arranged as adductors of the fingers to an imaginary line drawn through the long or middle finger, as follows :—The 1st palmar interosseous muscle "arises from the ulnar side of the 2nd metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the v 268 PALM OF THE HAND. idnarside of the corresponding first phalanx ; the ^ the radial side of the 4th metacarpal bone, and is inserted mtc the "Se of the corresponding first phalanx ; the 3rd anses from Fig 27. the radial side of the 5th metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the radial side of the corresponding first phalanx. %te Four dorsal interossei (Fig. 28) are penniform muscles a^umg from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, and therefore hoW by the sides of the palmar muscles to some extent but are best Sssected from behind.

These muscles vary slightly as to their attachments, but the following points respecting them have been elucidated by Duchenne's electrical investigations :—The insertion into the base of the first phalanx (Fig. 29), enables the interossei to act as flexors of that phalanx, whilst giving lateral move- Fig. 29. ment to the fingers to which they are attached. The slip (d)' sent forward to join the expansion of the extensor tendons extends the second and third phalanges ; and thus the action of the interossei is shown to include adduction to and abduction from the median line of the hand, with flexion of the first and extension of the second and third phalanges. [The interosseous muscles of the hand-should be compared with tnose oi the loot, when the same arrangement will be found to exist m both cases, with the exception that, in the foot, the imaginary line is drawn through the long or second toe, and that the muscles are . arranged in corresponding relation.] Ligaments op the Scapula. _ [The muscles about the scapula are to be followed to their exact insertions and cut short; the deltoid and the remains of the trapeziu must be carefully removed in order that the ligaments of the scapula and clavicle may be seen.] outpuid, The Acromioclavicular Articulation (Fig. 30) is a simple Fig. 29.—Attachment of an interosseous muscle (from Duchcnne). a.

The suprascapular artery goes over the ligament, but the nerve beneath it. The movements between the scapula and clavicle are very slight, but the two bones move freely together upon the thorax, the sterno- clavicular joint (vide Side of Neck) admitting of movement in every direction. The scapula is raised by the trapezius (upper part), levator anguli scapulae and rhombodei muscles ; being again de- pressed by the weight of the arm, assisted probably by the pectoralis minor, the lower fibres of the trapezius, and (indirectly) by the latissimus dorsi. It is drawn forward by the serratus magnus, and backward by. the rhomboidei. The rotation of the scapula upon the ribs, by which the head of the bone is elevated and the arm is raised beyond a right angle with the trunk, is due to the trapezius and to lower fibres of the serratus magnus ; the upper fibres of the latter muscle, the rhomboidei and the pectoralis minor acting in the opposite direction. The Shoulder Joint. [The muscles surrounding the shoulder are to be carefully removed those which are inserted into the tubercles of the humerus bein^ dissected as close to the capsular ligament as possible without iniurin^ it, and then cut short.] J 0 The shoulder is an enarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint, and has therefore a capsular ligament. It is surrounded and strengthened by the following muscles -.—above by the supra-spinatus, below by the long head of the triceps, in front by the subscapulars, and behind by the infra-spinatus and teres minor. The shoulder-joint admits of the following movements—flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction, which may be conveniently taken to resemble the same movements in the hip-joint. Thus the humerus is flexed (in front of the trunk) by the pectoralis major and coraco-brachialis muscles, and the anterior fibres of the deltoid. It is extended (behind the trunk) by the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and posterior fibres of the deltoid It is adducted by the weight of the limb, by the action of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, the two teres muscles, and coraco-brachialis and abducted by the deltoid and supra-spinatus. Rotation of the humerus upon the glenoid cavity is produced outwards by the infra spmatus and teres minor, inwards by the subscapular!s, teres maior latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major muscles. The last two musclesLIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 72 are antagonistic in the fact that the pectoralis major draws the arm acrosfthe chest after rotating it, whilst the latissimus dors, draws it behind the back. n , ^WvWr The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 30, 5) » -en to bloosal0. m partial dislocation of the humerus now that all the muscleare divided, and rough, owing to the insertion of some of the mu cl of the scapula into it.

It is attached above to the outer margin of the "fen k^caX of the scapula, and Mow to the anatomical neck of the Wei Ind is pierced at its lower margin by the long tendon of "eps It is thickened in front by a band of fibres attached to the root of the coracoid process and called the Coraco-Uuvural U9a- m The tendon of the biceps is to be followed into the articulation by laying open the capsular liga- Fig. 31. ment, when it will be found to be surrounded by a tube ^ of synovial membrane, and having become flattened, to be attached to the glenoid ligament and upper part of the glenoid cavity. This tube can be demonstrated before the capsule is opened by making traction upon the ten- don, when the tube will be everted (Fig. 31).

[The muscles about the elbow are to be removed, and great care must be taken in detaching the supinator brevis not to remove or damage the external lateral and the orbicular ligaments. Beneath the triceps close to the joint may be found a little slip of muscular fibre attached to the lower end of the humerus and the back of the joint; this is the Subanconeus, which is however often wanting or but slightly developed. All the muscles of the fore-arm and hand should now be removed to facilitate the examination of the wrist, &c. In removing the deep muscles of the fore-arm, care must be taken not to injure the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament.] The articulation of the humerus and ulna is a good example of ginglymus, or hinge-joint, and therefore has lateral ligaments ; the articulation of the upper end of the radius is an example of diarthrosis rotator ius, the head being surrounded by a ring partly of bone and partly of ligament; and the articulation between the head of the radius and the outer condyle of the humerus is an example of simple arthrodia. The ligaments of the elbow are united together and form one general capsule, but may be divided into anterior, posterior, external lateral, and internal lateral. The elbow-joint has in front the brachialis anticus with the brachial artery and median nerve; behind are the triceps and an- coneus muscles. To the inner side are the muscles arising from the intern al condyle, and the ulnar nerve with the inferior profunda artery lies upon the internal lateral ligament. Externally the muscles arising from the external condyle, with the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery, are in relation, and the supi- nator brevis is closely connected with the external lateral liga- ment. The fore-arm is flexed by the biceps, brachialis anticus, and supinator longus, and indirectly by the flexors of the wrist and fingers. It is extended by the triceps and anconeus, and indirectly by the extensors of the wrist and fingers. Eotation of the radius upon the ulna and humerus, and consequently pronation and supina- tion of the hand are produced as follows —Pronation by the pronator quadratus and pronator teres, supination by the biceps, supinator brevis, and very feebly by the supinator longus. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 32, i) is a broad membrane attached to the humerus immediately above the coronoid fossa and to the edge of the coronoid process of the ulna, and partly to the orbicular ligament of the radius. The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 33, 8) is thin and loose, and isLIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 74 attached to the upper margin of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, and to the edge of the olecranon process of the ulna. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 32, 2) is triangular, the apex being attached to the promi- Fig. 32. Fi*. 33. nent internal condyle, and the base being attached all along the inner margins of the coronoid and olecranon processes, and bridging across the notch between them'. The External Lateral Liga- ment (Fig. 33, 4) is a short thick band attached to the outer con- dyle, and radiating slightly at its attachment to the upper border of the orbicular ligament of the radius. The Synovial Membrane will be seen by removing the anterior ligament, and will be found to be reflected between the humerus, radius, and ulna, and also into the small joint between the head of the radius and the lesser sigmoid cavity. The articular surfaces of all the bones are encrusted with cartilage, but occasionally those of the coronoid and olecranon processes are separated by a groove aeross the bottom of tire sigmoid cavity. .

Superior (Fig. 34, 3).—This is a part of the elbow joint, and con- sists of the Orbicular ligament, a strong flat band of fibres which is attached to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and gives insertion to the external lateral ligament of the elbow, which must be removed to see the orbicular ligament satisfactorily. Middle (Fig. 32, 5).—The Interosseous ligament or membrane is the great bond between the shafts of the bones of the fore-arm, its fibres running obliquely downwards from the radius to the ulna. It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones in all their lower part, a space being left between the bones above, through which the posterior interosseous vessels go. The membrane has a large opening in it near the lower part for the anterior interosseous artery, and one or two smaller ones for its branches. The Round or oblique ligament (Fig. 32, 4) is very rarely seen, but is a band attached to the outer side of the coronoid process of the ulna and to the radius below the bicipital tubercle. Its direction is therefore the reverse of that of the interosseous membrane. Inferior (Fig. 35, 2) is formed by anterior and posterior ligaments, which are short fibrous bands passing between the extremities of the radius and ulna, and by an inter-articular fibro-cartilage which will be seen when the joint is opened (Fig. 37, 3). The Wrist Joint. This is a condyloid joint or hinge-joint admitting of considerable lateral movement,' and has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The wrist joint has in front the radial artery, the tendons of the flexor longus pollicis, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis and profundus, with the median nerve, ulnar artery and nerve, and flexor carpi ulnaris. To the outer side, the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and prirni internodii pollicis, with the radial artery and nerve. Behind, the extensor carpi radialis longior and the brevior, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, extensor communis digitorum, indicis, and minimi digiti, and the extensor carpi ulnaris (Fig. 24). The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments (Fig. 35, 3) are broad bands attached to the front and back of the lower end of the radius and to the front and back of the first row of carpal bones, beim- united with the ligaments of the carpus. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 35, 4) is a thick bandLIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 76 attached to the styloid process of the radius, and to the outer side of the scaphoid and trapezium. Kg. 34. Fig. 35.

Fig. 36. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 35, 5) is longer than the external, and is attached to the styloid process of the ulna, and to the upper surface of the cuneiform bone. The Bones of the Carpus (Fig. 35, 6) are bound together by vertical and transverse dorsal and palmar, and at each side by slender lateral ligaments, which will not repay a special dissec- tion ; also by interosseous liga- ments which bind together the several bones of each row (except the pisiform which has a sepa- rate capsular ligament), and will be seen when the joints are opened (Fig. 36). The Metacarpal Bones (Fig. 35, 8) (with the exception of the first) are connected with the second row of the carpus by dorsal and palmar ligaments, and the four metacarpal bones are joined together by transverse dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments. The first metacarpal bone has a separate capsular ligament con- necting it with the trapezium, this joint being enarthrodial (Fig. 35, g). The^ bones of the carpus and metacarpus are capable only of a slight gliding or arthrodial movement, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which is capable of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction.

The Posterior ligament is a distinct structure beneath the expansion of the extensor tendons. The Lateral ligaments are strong bands which are attached to the sides of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and pass obliquely to the anterior margins of the phalanges. Each joint has a separate synovial membrane. The Phalangeal Articulations are similar to those between the metacarpus and phalanges.

The crest and anterior superior spine of the ilium will be readily seen and felt, the anterior inferior spine less so, on account of the muscles covering it; the spine and crest of the • pubes can also be distinguished. The great trochanter is easily recognised from three • to four inches below the crest of the ilium, and should be thoroughly i manipulated that its relation to the upper border of the pelvis and surrounding parts may be clearly appreciated during the movements of the limb • and the. two sides of the body should be compared if i any morbid change about the hip is suspected. An important diagnostic sign of a healthy condition of the neck of the femur is, that when the limb is rotated the trochanter describes part of the arc of a circle, which is not the case when fracture exists. When an impacted fracture or absorption of the neck of the femur has taken place, the arc is much smaller and the movement less complete. The head of the femur may be felt behind the trochanter when the limb is rotated, and in a very thin subject it may be detected in front, when the finger is thrust deeply into Scarpa's triangle.

'THE FEMORAL SHEATH. 87 is the saphenous opening, which is obscured by the attachment of a portion of the superficial fascia, called from the numerous perfora- tions in it cribriform. If the cribriform fascia be carefully removed together with the small veins, the artificially produced saphenous opening will then be clearly seen.] The Saphenous opening (Fig. 39, o) varies considerably in dif- ferent subjects, and is generally best seen in the female. It is an oval opening half an inch wide, produced by a splitting and folding of the fascia lata at this point; the outer edge of the opening being formed by the iliac portion of the fascia which is attached to the whole length of Poupart's ligament, whilst the inner and deeper part is formed by the pubic portion of the fascia lata which, passing beneath the femoral vessels, binds down the pectineus muscle and is attached to the pectineal line. The outer border, which can be made sharp and semicircular with the scalpel, is known as the falci- form or sickle-shape margin (process of Burns), and over the lower part of this the saphena vein passes to open into the femoral vein. The superior extremity of the margin, where it joins Poupart's liga- ment and overlies the femoral vessels, is sometimes called Hey's ligament. The saphenous opening is the external aperture through which femoral hernia when of large size passes, and might there- fore well be called the external femoral ring, although strictly speak- ing there is in the undissected condition no definite ring, but merely a weak point in the fascia through which the hernia protrudes, pushing before it the cribriform fascia. The position of the thigh has considerable influence upon the condition of the saphenous opening, and its edges will be found to be relaxed when the thigh is flexed and adducted, the position in which the patient is placed when the " taxis" is applied for the reduction of a hernia. [An incision is to be made from the lower end of the saphenous opening transversely outwards for two inches, and a corresponding one immediately below Poupart's ligament, and the piece of fascia thus marked out and including the falciform process is to be reflected to the outer side.] Sheath of the vessels (Pig. 40, Jc).—Beneath the fascia lata in the upper part of the thigh will now be seen a delicate fascia, con- taining a little fat and covering the femoral vessels, called the sheath of the femoral vessels. This sheath is a tube, broader above than below and becoming gradually lost upon the vessels, the anterior part of which is continuous with the fascia transversalis, and the posterior part with the fascia iliaca of the abdomen, beneath Poupart'sFEMORAL HERNIA. 88 licrament. Three vertical incisions, one in the centre and one at each side of the tubular sheath, will enable the dissector to see that it is di- vided by two slender septa into three compartments, the femoral artery occupying the outermost, the Fig. 40. 1 f j —o femoral vein the middle, and the innermost or smallest one being occupied only by a lym- phatic gland. This last divi- sion of the femoral sheath is the femoral or crural canal. The Femoral or Crural Ring- (Fig. 41, 12).—If the finger be passed upwards along the crural canal it will enter the Crural or Femoral Ring beneath Poupart's ligament, displacing a lymphatic gland and a little piece of subperi- toneal fat, which occupy it and form the septum crurale. The boundaries of the crural ring can be better felt than seen, and are, in front, Pou- part's ligament, or crural arch (with occasionally a distinct band of fascia transversalis bene** it, called the ^seplS the and body of the pubes ; externally, ^JT^qZ,^ ligament, septum ; ami internally, tbe sbarp »^™°lal hem° kaves olt; tbe Anger sbould ^^g^ an incb • T KSSSfflSS t* tbe Ual nag to m length, along which lemora forced its way the saphenous opening ; but asoon „^ attachment of the through that spot, it ascends, owing to tne cu* _ Kg. .O.-Crura! sheath laid open (from Wood a.

The Coverings of a Femoral Hernia (Fig. 42) will be readily learned if the course it takes has been thoroughly under- stood. In its descent the intestine pushes before it (1) peritoneal sac, (2) sep- tum crurale, (3) femoral sheath, (4) cribriform fascia, (5) superficial fascia and skin. It must not be supposed that the surgeon will meet with these various coverings in ope- rating upon a strangulated femoral hernia, since he usually pays no attention to any of them until he reaches the sac or peritoneum, which is to-be recognised by its thin bluish appearance, and by the fluid generally to be seen : through its slightly transparent wall.* Surgery.—Operation for strangulated femoral hernia.

It is very seldom satisfactorily seen unless traced from the lumbar plexus. Fig. 43. The External cutaneous nerve (3) is to be found in a fold of fascia lata close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and pierces the fascia at a variable point, to be distributed by an anterior and a pos- terior branch to the outer side of the thigh and part of the buttock. The Middle Cutaneous nerve (5) (from the anterior crural,) pierces the fascia in the upper third of the. thigh, and will be afterwards- traced as far as the knee. The Internal cutaneous and Long Saphenous nerves are not seen at present. Scarpa's Triangle. [The fascia lata is to be removed from the hollow below Poupart's ligament as far as the skin has been reflected, and the muscles, ' vessels and nerves thus exposed, are to be as thoroughly cleaned as is possible without disturbing their relations.] Scarpa's triangle is the space in the upper third of the front of the I thigh, containing the first part of the femoral vessels.

The part now exposed is that above I the sartorius, and is usually nearly half of the whole length of the • vessel. When the thigh is slightly flexed and abducted, the artery :runs from a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the ; anterior superior iliac spine (or a little to the inner side of the centre of Poupart's ligament), through the middle of the triangle in a line with the pronii- : nent tubercle on the inner condyle of the : femur ; but when the thigh is fully ex- ' tended it will be seen to wind slightly to I the inner side of the limb. This portion i of the artery is covered only by the super- lficial fascia and fascia lata, except near '! Poupart's ligament, where it has been l seen to be enclosed in the femoral sheath. 1 One or two branches of the internal cuta- neous nerve cross the vessel at variable points. Behind the artery from above downwards are, the psoas (with a portion of the femoral sheath and the nerve to the pectineus) ; the pectineus, but separated from the femoral artery by the profunda artery and vein and the femoral vein ; and the adductor longus. To the outer side throughout is the anterior crural nerve, but separated at the upper part by a small > piece of the psoas ; and the long saphenous branch is in close relation at the lower part of the space. The femoral vein is to the inner side near Poupart's ligament, but lower down is behind the artery, forming one of its posterior relations. Surgery (Fig. 46).—From its superficial position the femoral artery can be readily felt during life, and compression may be effected m any part of the triangle, but most satisfactorily against the margin of the pubes. The artery has been tied above the origin of the profunda, through an incision parallel to Poupart's ligament and half an inch below it, but the vessel is more commonly tied at the lower part of the triangle. The latter operation is readily performed through an incision, from three to four inches long, beginning two inches below Poupart's ligament and running in the middle of the Fig. 4G.-Incision3 for tying the femoral artery (from Fergusson's < Surgery').g| SCARPA'S TRIANGLE. j ir, iW direction of the liml), which is lower part of the space, and m the <B h the to he abducted.

When inflamed, this bursa forms what is commonly known as "house- maid's knee." The Fascia lata or deep fascia of the thigh is now thoroughly exposed. It has been seen to be attached to Poupart's ligament and the crest of the pubes, and can now be followed to the crest of the ilium. The fascia is strongest on the front and outer side of the thigh, and on each side of the prominent extensor muscles may be seen a white line marking the positions of the external and internal intermuscular septa. The fascia blends with the capsule of the knee, and is continued over the patella to the heads of the tibia and fibula, being incorporated with the several tendons attached to those parts. Piercing the fascia lata at several points are the cutaneous nerves of the thigh, some of which have been already seen, but the follow- ing are now to be traced to their distributions and then to their origins, the fascia being removed as may be necessary for the latter purpose. The Internal cutaneous nerve (Fig. 45, 7, 8) is a branch of the anterior crural, and divides at a variable point into two branches, outer and inner. The outer branch frequently perforates the sartorius muscle, which it supplies, and becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the thigh, the branches reaching as far as the pateUa. The inner branch having crossed the femoral artery appears close to the saphena vein a little above the knee, and its branches unite with those of the other branch and with the internal saphenous [nerve. Occasionally a junction between this nerve and the obturator may be traced on the inner side of the middle of the thigh. The Long or Internal Saphenous nerve (Fig. 45, 16) (the course of which will be afterwards seen) becomes cutaneous at the inner side * This last is often described as coming from the suDerfiri-.l rli™;™ i • above is the more common arrangement. superncial division, but the96 FRONT OF THE THIGH. of the hnee joint, where it lies at f*^^^t Before looming cutaneous it sends a'^nierees the siin of the felM^—J^t^t-ST^ ' Muscles of the Front of the Thigh. insertion of each.] Connected with the fascia lata on the outer side of the thigh is the Tensor Fascia or Vagina Femoris (Fig. 47, 4 which M to etosed hy removing the fascia helow the crest of the Searises from the outside of the anterior superior spine of the oX 1 mh • it is also an internal rotator of the femur.

It is supplied by the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural nerve. The Quadriceps Extensor is the fleshy mass on the front of the thigh consisting of the rectus femoris super- ficially, with the crureus beneath it, and the vastus externus and internus on either side. The Rectus Femoris (Fig. 47, 6) has no attachment to the femur, but stretches over it from the pelvis to the patella. It arises 1 by a double tendinous origin, from the ante- rior inferior spine of the ilium and from the rough depression above the acetabulum, but !the outer or reflected tendon cannot be tho- iroughly seen at present. The two heads unite to form a fusiform penniform muscle, which is tendinous on its under surface at ; the lower part, and passes to be inserted into : the upper part of the patella in conjunction with the other extensor muscles. Beneath the rectus will be seen the Exter- nal circumflex branch of the profunda artery. This arises from the outer side of the vessel near its origin, and runs transversely between the branches of the anterior crural nerve upon the vastus externus and beneath the sartorius and rectus femoris, to the outer side bf the thigh, where it divides into ascending, Jansverse, and descending sets of branches.'

In order to relax the muscles and bring the fragment down, it is necessary to ' extend the leg upon the thigh and flex the thigh upon the pelvis.' The Femoral Artery in Hunter's Canal (Fig. 49).—Hunter's canal is formed by a tendinous expansion derived from the adductors longus and magnus and the vastus internus, which encloses the femoral vessels and long saphenous nerve in the middle third of the thigh. The canal begins at the crossing of the sartorius muscle and ends at the opening of the adductor magnus, where the artery enters the popliteal space, being covered by the sartorius in its whole length. On laying open the canal, the femoral artery will be found to have its vein behind and to the outer side until it reaches the opening in the adductor magnus ; the saphenous nerve, at first to the outer side, crosses the artery to wind round the tendon and become cutaneous on the inner side of the knee. The Opening in the adductor magnus, as it is commonly called, is in reality an opening between the round tendon of the adductor magnus on the inner side, and the fibres of the vastus internus and the femur on the outer side, the tendinous fibres of the adductor lormrng the remainder of its circumference. The only structures passing through it are the femoral artery and vein. The Anastomotica magna is the only vessel arising from the femoral artery in Hunter's canal, but its branches not unfrequently come off at two or more separate places. The anastomotica has a superficial and deep branch : the superficial accompanying the saphenous nerve to the skin, the deep branch entering the vastus internus, through which it descends to the knee to anastomose with the articular branches of the popliteal artery. Surgery (Fig. 46).-Deligation of the femoral artery in Hunter's canal is not frequently performed in the present day, but the vessel is readily reached by an incision to the inner side of the vastus internus in the middle third of the thigh, by which the outer edge of the sartorius muscle is met with. The sartorius is turned inwards, open the artery will be exposed. It is more convenient to pass the aneurism needle from without inwards than the reverse, the vein lying to the outer side. ' The Anterior Crural Nerve (Fig. 49, 5) supplies branches to all the muscles of the front 0f the thigh except the tensor fasci* femoris and also gives a branch to the pectineus on the inner side of Z Wb. The branch to the sartorius has been aWy ^n to arte H 2100 INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. from the middle cutaneous nerve, and the remaining branches can now be traced from the deep division.

It arises from the upper part of the triangular surface immediately in front of the ilio-pectineal line, and slightly from the line itself, and winds to the back of the femur to be inserted into the line lead- ing from the trochanter minor to the linea aspera, a bursa intervening. Jt is supplied by the anterior crural nerve. [The pectineus should be divided and turned aside, in order to bring the deeper parts into view.] Insertion of the Psoas and Iliacus.—The muscles form a single tendon, along the inner border of which, however, muscular fibres are continued for its whole length. The insertion of the tendon is into the back of the lesser trochanter, and the muscular fibres are prolonged for. a short distance below that point. The Adductor Brevis (Fig. 49, 18) has the superficial division of the obturator nerve lying upon it, and the deep division of the same nerve appearing between it and the adductor magnus. It arises from the front of the pubes below the adductor longus and between the gracilis and obturator externus, and is inserted into the whole of the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera behind the pectineus. It is supplied by the obturator nerve. The action of the adductors is implied by their name, but they •act at the same time as external rotators of the thigh. The power ■of adduction can be carried beyond the middle line so as to cross the thighs over one another. The pectineus is an adductor and a flexor of the thigh, and the gracilis is in addition a flexor of the leg. All the muscles of the inside of the thigh are supplied by the obturator nerve except the pectineus, which receives its nerve from the anterior crural. The Profunda Artery (Fig. 48) has been seen to arise from the femoral artery in Scarpa's triangle about two inches below Poupart's ligament. It lies at first to the outer side of the femoral artery and against the iliacus and psoas, but then winds inwards on to the pectineus behind the femoral artery, which is separated from ■it by both the profunda and femoral veins. The profunda next winds between the borders of the pectineus and adductor longus and lies against the adductor brevis; then passing behind the adductor longus, it runs on to the adductor magnus, where it ends The profunda vein is superficial to its artery in the- whole of its course.INN EE SIDE OF THE THIGH. 102 The Branches of the Profunda are the external and internal circumflex, three perforating arteries, and a terminal branch, besides branches to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. l; The External circumflex artery arises from the outer side of the • profunda near its origin, and has been already seen in the dissection of the thigh (p. 97). 2. The Internal circumflex artery (Fig. 48) arises from the inner side of the profunda near its origin, and passing beneath the pectineus, reaches the obturator externus muscle above the adductor brevis, when it divides into two ter- minal branches. One passes superficially to the adductor brevis, to supply the muscles on the inner side of the thigh; the other passes beneath the adductor brevis, and after giving a branch to the hip- joint, ends in a branch which will be found between the quadratus femoris and ad- ductor magnus in the dissec- tion of the buttock. 3. The Perforating arteries (Fig. 48) which are three in number, pierce the adductor, muscles to reach the ham- strings, which thev supply on their deep surfaces. The upper and Series perforate the adductors brevis and magnus ; the fa£ arises below the level of the adductor brevis, and therefore p ^rforat s only the adductor magnus. The nutritious artery to he femur generally comes from the middle perforating artery, and when end - ing the foramen in the linea aspera has a direction from the knee ^ The Terminal branch (Fig. 48) ends in the fibres of the adductor magnus. .

[The adductor "brevis is to be divided in order to expose the deep portion of the obturator nerve, the adductor magnus, and the obtu- rator externus, which are to be cleaned.] The Profunda Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery and ends in the femoral vein, being superficial to the pro- funda artery throughout. The Obturator Nerve (Fig. 49, 8) is the last branch of the lumbar plexus, being derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It leaves the pelvis at the upper part of the obturator foramen with the obturator ar- tery, and immediately divides into superficial and deep por- tions. The superficial division lies upon the adductor brevis and supplies the adductor longus, Fig. (from 49.—Nerves of the tliigh Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Gangliated cord of sympathetic. 2.

The deep division pierces the obturator externus and lies on the adductor magnus both of which it supplies, and gives an articular branch through the adductor macmus to the back of the knee, which affords one explanation of the pain referred to the knee in disease of the hip-joint _ An Accessory obturator nerve is occasionally found passing from the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus over the pub*> beneath the pectineus. When this exists it more or less replaces the super- ficial division of the obturator nerve. , The Adductor Magnus (Fig. 49, 26) anses from the lower part of the descending ramus of the pubes ; from the ascendmg ramus ol the ischium ; and from the lower part of the tuberosity.

The lower fibres, forming an almost distinct muscle, end in a round tendon which is inserted into the tubercle above the inner condyle of the femur, and, by means of an expansion, into the lower part of the line leading to it. It is this tendon which bounds the " opening in the adductor inagnus." The muscle is supplied by the obturator nerve, and also by the great sciatic. Above the upper border of the adductor inagnus a portion of the Obturator Externus can be seen. It arises from the margin of the anterior half of the obturator foramen, and from the corresponding- portion of the outer surface of the obturator membrane. The fibres are directed backwards, and end in a tendon which passes in a groove below the acetabulum, to be inserted into the digital fossa of the femur, as will be seen in the dissection of the buttock. The obturator externus is an external rotator of the thigh and is supplied by the obturator nerve. The obturator artery is best seen after the removal of the thigh from the pelvis, in the dissection of which it is included. The Buttock. [The body being turned on its face, the buttocks are to be raised by blocks beneath the pelvis until the thigh can be well flexed with the knee on the table, or, if preferred, the legs may be allowed to hang over the end of the table.] The dissector should recognise the crest of the ilium, which will bound his dissection superiorly, also the sacrum and coccyx, and the tuberosity of the ischium, which can be felt through the gluteus maxinius. The relation of the trochanter to the several parts of the pelvis in the different positions of the limb is to be noted also, as being of great practical importance in the diagnosis of fractures and dislocations. The " fold of the buttock " formed bv the lower border of the gluteus maximus will be seen when the muscle is stretched by rotating the thigh inwards, but will vary according to the muscular development of the subject. The prominences of°the inner and outer hamstrings and the hollow of the ham will be readily seen, and it should be noted how much deeper the space appears when ithe knee is flexed, and how readily, under these circumstances the (popliteal vessels can be felt, owing to the relaxation of the fascia,' [An incision is to be made along the crest of the ildum and down106 THE BUTTOCK. the middle of the sacrum to the tip of the coccyx when if; the perineum and thigh have been dissected, it will only he necee^ to make another cut across the upper part of the hack of the thigh to allow the large flap of skin to he reflected outwards.J The amount of fat beneath the skin of the buttock varies consider- ably, and if there is a large quantity it will be a waste of time to look for cutaneous nerves. . The Cutaneous Nerves are descending and ascending. The descending branches will be found passing over the middle o the crest of the"ilium, and are the iliac branches of he last dorsal and first lumbar (ilio-hypogastric) nerves, the former being fiont of the latter. There are a few branches also derived from the pos- terior divisions of the lower lumbar and upper sacral nerves, ^hicn pass obliquely from near the middle line P The ascending branches turn round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are branches of the lesser sciatic nerve. [The portion of deep fascia covering the g^SfrfuteS inlront of the gluteus maximus is to be '^flexto^and maximus itself, the fibres being put on ^«^h^^older inverting the thigh, and the dissector beginning at the m£orue of the muscle on the right, and its lower border on the left limb. J The Gluteus Maximus (Fig. 51, 2) arises from the between the posterior third of the.crest of curved line on the dorsum ilii ;* from the side of the lower part ot Z .rum, and the side of the coccyx ; fromtte tendinous expansion over the back of the sacrum ; and from the surface of the great LcLsciat c ligament, which will be seen when the muscle is divided The^fib fs run downwards and outwards, and the upper two-third, of hrmuscle are inserted into-the fascia lata covermg the grea Lchanter (ilio-tibial band), the lower tlnrd being attached to he rough-Ige leading from the back of the trochanter major to the linea asoera of the femur, and into the fascia as well. outwards.

Some branches of the superficial gluteal artery at the upper, and of the sciatic at the lower part of the muscle must necessarily be divided, but the nerves going to its under sur- -^S- 51. face from the small sciatic should be preserved if possible.] Three bursas will be found in connection with the gluteus maximus ; one between its fascia and the great trochanter; a second between the fascia and the vastus externus ; and the third over the tuberosity of the is- chium, which is remarkable for its change of relation to the muscle ; since when the body is in the erect posture the muscle covers the tuber and its bursa, but when in the sitting posture, the muscle slips back and the bursa becomes subcutaneous. The Parts beneath, the Glutens Maxi- mus (Fig. 52) can now be seen, although covered by loose cellular tissue which is to be afterwards removed. They are from above downwards :—1, gluteus medius; 2, super- ficial gluteal vessels ; 3, pyriformis muscle ; 4, sciatic vessels and nerves (great and small); 5, pudic vessels and nerve, and nerve to obturator interims ; 6, tendon of the obturator internus with the gemelli muscles above and below it; 7, tendon of the obturator externus ; 8, quadratus femoris and upper border of adductor magnus ; 9, great sacro-sciatic liga- ment ; 10, tuber ischii and muscles attached to it.

In order to clean the museles, the thigh must be well rotated inwards, and m the case of the gluteus medius, it must be crossed beneath the opposite limb.J The Gluteus Medius (Fig. 53, 2) arises from the dorsum ilii between the superior and middle curved lines, and from the fascia covering its anterior part. The fibres converge to be mserted into the outer surface of the great trochanter, extending obliquely from its posterior superior angle downwards and forwards. The anterior boier of the gluteus medius is united with the minimus, which lies beneath it. The insertion of the gluteus medius is best seen when the muscle has been divided. TThe gluteus medius is to be divided close to its origin without iniurincr the -luteus minimus, the separation from which is marked bv Artery ? and hHuterior borders of the muscles having been Belated with the scalpel, the gluteus medius is to be turne^0wn without injuring the vessels and nerves beneath A bursa will be found on the great trochanter beneath the tendon.j The Gluteus Minimus (Fig. 52, 8) arises from the dorsum ilii between the middle and inferior curved lines, being united by its anterior border with the gluteus medius. It is mserted into the anterior surface of the great trochanter. , . . n„+ The two smaller glutei muscles assist in mamtaining the erect posture by fixing the pelvis on the femur, or if the pelvis be fixed, they act as abductors and rotators of the thigh, the gluteus mminiu and the anterior portion of the medius rotating inwards, and^ the posterior portion of the medius rotating outwards. They are both suvvliecl bv the superior gluteal nerve. ThPy^iformL (Fig- 52, 9) is only partly seen m he dissection of the buttock. It arises from the front at the ateral mass 0the sacrum between the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sacral foramina and often from the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and passing out of he great sacro-sciatic foramen ends in a round tendon which is ^nserted mto , distinct depression at the posterior part ^^^^ great trochanter. The muscle is occasionally divided mto.two par* by the passage of a portion of the great sciatic ^ fibres.

If the tendon of the obturator internus be divided near its in- • sertion without disturbing the gemelli, and drawn up from the margin of the sciatic foramen a large bursa will be found, which, when opened, will be seen to lubricate the under surface of the tendon and the margin of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The under surface of the obturator tendon is subdivided into from three to five small tendons, and the margin of the bone is encrusted with cartilage and grooved to corres- pond with these.

It lies against the back of the hip-joint, to which it gives a branch. The Pudic Nerve (Fig. 53, 7) from the sacral plexus, is seen lying on the spine of the ischium internal to the pudic artery. If the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve should happen to arise separately from the sacral plexus, it will be found accompanying the pudic in this position. The dissection of the popliteal space should be made before the skin on the back of the upper part of the thigh is removed, so that the re- lations of the parts in the ham may be undisturbed. The Popliteal Space. [A vertical incision is to be made in the middle line of the limb at the back ot the knee, extending for six inches above and the same distance below the joint. A transverse incision at each end of this will _allow the skin to be fully reflected. A few branches of the small sciatic nerve may be found in the superficial fascia, which is to be re- moved m order to expose the deep fascia.] Deep or Popliteal Fascia.-This is continuous with the fascia lata, being strengthened by the hamstring tendons, and stretches across the popliteal space to protect the vessels and nerves beneath. When the limb is extended it is tightly stretched, but is at once relaxed on bendmg the knee. I The fascia being removed, the hollow of the ham will be brought into view filled with loose fat, which is to be removed to expose the popliteal vessels and nerves. Imbedded in the fat of the popliteal space are some lymphatic glands, and it may be noted that there are no glands m the limb below this point. The boundaries of the space are to be carefully cleaned, care being taken, at the lower part, of two small nerves and a vein which run on the back of the leg. the Pophteal Space (Fig. 54) is a lozenge-shaped cavity at the back of the knee, which in the dissected state extends for some dis- tance above and below the joint. Its upper part is bounded externally by the tendon of the biceps ; internally by the tendons of the senii- tendmosus. and semi-membranosus muscles, with the gracilis and sir tonus more superficially.

It is one of the divisions of tne great sciatic nerve, and passes with a very slight degree of obliquity from the outer to the inner side of the ham, extending through, the whole 'length of the space and disappearing beneath the gastrocnemius muscle. It thus crosses from the outer to the inner side of the popliteal artery, which it accompanies to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its branches are (1) articular, which pierce the posterior surface of the knee-joint and accom- pany the inferior internal and azygos articular arteries ; (2) muscular to the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and popliteus ; and (3) the external saphe- nous nerve or ramus communicans tibialis, which lies in the groove between the heads of the gastrocne- mius (sometimes beneath a few of its fibres), and will be traced in the dis- section of the back of the leg. The External Popliteal Nerve or Peroneal (Fig. 55, 8), the other division of the great sciatic, is alto- gether under cover of the biceps at the upper part of the space, but be- comes visible close to its tendon near the head of the fibula.

The vein lies superficially to the artery, and to its inner side at the lower part of the space, but crosses to the outer side above. It receives branches corresponding to those of the artery and, at a variable point, the external saphena vein, which lies on the back of the leg between the heads of the gastrocnemius, opens into it. Some lymphatic glands are placed close to the artery, into which lymphatics, from the back of the leg, discharge themselves. The Back of the Thigh.

The biceps and semi-tendinosus, which arise m common, are superficial to the semi-membranosus near the tuber ischii, and the semi-tendinosus maintains this relation to the semi-membranosus throughout. The short head of the biceps will be found on the outer side of the lower part of the femur. The Biceps (Fig. 53, 19) or outer hamstring arises by its long head from the anterior or lower of the two surfaces on the tuber ischii in common with the semi-tendinosus, and from the great sacro-sciatic ligament. It crosses the great sciatic nerve and, by diverging from the semi-membranosus in the lower fourth of the thigh, forms the outer boundary of the popliteal space.

The inner slip limits especially extension and rotation inwards ; the outer slip rotation outwards and adduction ot the femur, and both have an important influ- ence on the production of the several forms of dislocation of the head of the femur. A bursa intervenes between the tendon of the psoas and the front of the hip-joint, which occasionally . communicates with the synovial cavity through the capsular ligament. . It should be noticeW^^ ^ Fig. 57.-The mo-femoral.or T-ligament of Bigelow (from Bryant).

The anterior part is put on the stretch in abduction of the thigh, and the ilio-femoral band serves to prevent the head starting from the cotyloid cavity, hence the rarity of dislocation forwards. The capsular ligament having been divided, the thigh will be seen to be held by the so-called ligamentum teres, which will be brought into view by abducting and everting the limb. In doing this a squeaking noise will probably be heard, which is clue to the sudden separation of the moist articular surfaces of the femur and pelvis, Fig. 58. which are covered with cartilage. The inter-articular ligament (teres) being divided, the limb can be removed. The single synovial membrane of the joint will be seen to be reflected over the mner surface of the capsular ligament on to the neck of the femur, and to be prolonged over the ligamentum teres to the bottom of the acetabulum, which it lines. In the bottom of the cavity it is Fig. 58.—Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint (from Wilson) 1. Oblique sacro-iliac ligament. 6. Cotyloid ligament. 2. Great sacro-sciatic ligament. 7.

S. 123 Fig. 59. — 2 The Gastrocnemius (Fig. 60, 4), the superficial muscle of the calf, has a double-headed origin from the back of the femur imme- diately above the condyles, both heads being firmly attached to the capsule of the knee-joint. A bursa, sometimes communicating -with the knee-joint, lies between the inner head and the tendon of the semi-membranosus. The two heads are the lower boundaries of the popliteal space, and unite to form one large muscle, the fibres of which end about the middle of the leg in a broad tendon, which contracts near the heel into the thick rounded tendo Achillis (6). This, which is the common insertion of the gastrocnemius and the subjacent soleus, expands again slightly, to be inserted into the lower part of the posterior surface of the calcaneum, a bursa intervening between it and the upper part of the same bone. [The remaining head of the gastro- 7 cnemius being carefully divided near its origin, and the muscle turned down as far as possible, the plantaris and soleus, with the popliteus covered by its fascia, will be brought into view.] The Plantaris (Fig. 54, 12) arises from above the external condyle of the femur and from the line leading to it from the linea aspera, the muscle lying internal to the outer head of the gas- trocnemius. Its fleshy fibres are about '^-—Superficial nerves of the back of the leg (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Internal popliteal nerve. 2. External popliteal nerve. 3. Internal saphenous vein.

It is placed between the gastrocnemius and soleus, and crosses obliquely so as to get to the inner side of the tendo Achillis, by the side of or in common with which it is inserted into the os calcis. It is analogous to the palmaris longus of the upper extremity. The Soleus (Fig. 60, 5) is tendinous on its surface, to allow the corresponding tendinous expansion on the under surface of the gastro- cnemius to move freely upon it, and between the two is a quantity of loose areolar tissue. It arises from the oblique line of the tibia and from the inner border of the tibia in its middle third ; also from the posterior surface of the head and upper third or more of the fibula, and from a deep tendon which arches over the tibial vessels and nerves. The fibres end in a broad tendon, which joins that of the gastrocnemius in the lower third of the leg to form the tendo Achillis, the insertion of which has been seen. The muscular fibres are inserted into the deep surface of the tendon to within two inches of the heel. . By dividing the fibres of the soleus vertically and with care, a tendinous expansion on the deep surface of the muscle will be brought into view, which stretches across the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and protects them from pressure during the movements of the limb. This deep tendon is an important guide in the operation of tying the posterior tibial artery, and must be divided • to reach it.

The fonn of club-foot known as ' talipes equinus' is due in part to contraction of the muscles of the calf, and division of the tendo Achillis is practised for its relief. [The plantaris is to be divided and the soleus cut near its attach- ments to the tibia and fibula, when these muscles and the gastro- cnemius are to be turned clown, and the bursa between the tendon and the os calcis noticed. The posterior tibial vessels and nerve, partially covered by the deep layer of fascia, will now be exposed, and beneath them the deep muscles of the leg, with the popliteus covered by its lascia above.] J The Popliteus (Fig. 61, 6) is covered by a strong fascia which is derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, upon which the lower parts of the popliteal vessels and nerve rest. This must be removed to expose the oblique fibres of the muscle, and an incision must be made through the coverings of the knee immediately in front of the external lateral ligament to see its tendinous origin. The popliteus arises from within the general capsule of the knee (though outside the synovial cavity) by a round tendon, which is fixed to a distinct pit on the outer side of the external condyle, below and a little in front of the tubercle for the attachment of the external lateral ligament. The tendon passes through a groove in the bone and beneath the external lateral ligament, and after quitting the joint the fleshy fibres are developed, which are inserted into nearly the whole of the triangular surface on the back of the upper part of the tibia above the oblique line. upon the thigh, and has a tendency to rotate the tibia inwards, which is checked bv the arrangement of the crucial ligaments within the knee. The popliteus is supplied by a branch of the internal popliteal nerve. [The incomplete intermuscular layer of fascia of the leg beino- removed, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve are to be cleaned when the subjacent muscles will be found in the following posil tions :-flexor longus digitorum most internally, tibialis posticus in the middle, and flexor longus pollicis to the outer side.] P The Flexor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 61, 7) arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line and internal to the attachment of the tibialis posticus (from which it is separated ht an indistinct vertical ridge and an intermuscular septum attach, ! tn t *» of*e lmiscle reachineto ^ of the lower end of the tibia.

The Tibialis Posticus (Fig. 61, 8) is the only one of the deep muscles which is attached to both bones of the leg, between which it therefore lies, its tendinous surface forming septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique Hue and external to the flexor longus digitorum, to within two inches of the ankle ; from nearly the whole length of the interosseous membrane ; and from the whole of the internal surface of the fibula immediately behind the interosseous line * as well as from the intermuscular septa on each side, which are continuous with the aponeurosis over it The muscle is overlapped by the flexor digitorum, and between the tibial and fibular origins the anterior tibial vessels pass.

The Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 61, 9) is a well-marked penniform muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the fibula below the origin of the soleus to within an inch of the ankle ; and-* also from the intermuscular septa between it and the peronei muscles'' on the outer side of the bone, and the tibialis posticus internally. The muscle ends in a tendon which lies to the outer side of the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and, passing through a separate division of the annular ligament, winds to the sole of the foot through an oblique groove at the back of the astragalus and another below the lesser process of the os calcis. The flexor longus pollicis and flexor digitorum are direct flexors of the toes and extensors of the foot, i.e., they point the toes. The tibialis posticus is also an extensor of the foot, which it tends to draw inwards. The three muscles are supplied by the posterior tibial nerve. Surgery.—The form of club-foot called 'talipes varus' which causes the patient to walk on the outside of the foot, is clue in part to the contraction of the tibialis posticus and sometimes of the flexor digitorum. The operation of dividing these tendons is performed immediately above the internal malleolus, a blunt-pointed tenotomy knife being used after the first incision, to avoid all danger of wound- ing the posterior tibial artery. ^ The Posterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 63, 21) is the direct con- tinuation of the popliteal artery, and begins at the point of bifurca- tion of that vessel, which is usually the lower border of the popliteus muscle. In the upper part of its course the posterior tibial artery lies between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg, but below the origin of the soleus it is only bound down by the intermuscular layer of fascia, and lies by the side of the tendo Achillis. It rests upon (in the position for dissection) the tibialis posticus for two-thirds of its length, but then upon the flexor digitorum ; and at the ankle lies upon the tibia between the tendons of the flexor digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. The vessel after wards passes through a division of the annular ligament to the" interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides into internal and external plantar arteries. The posterior tibial nerve has a close relation to the artery throughout, lying first to itsBACK OF THE LEG. 128 inner side and then crossing to its outer side, m which relation it con- toes to the foot.

The Peroneal (12), always of considerable size and sometimes larger than the posterior tibial, comes off about two inches below the popliteus. It lies first between the tibialis posticus and flexor longus pollicis, but afterwards pierces the fibres of the flexor pollicis and runs close to the fibula to near its lower end. In this part of its course it gives muscular branches, and the nutri- tious artery to the fibula, which runs from the knee-joint. It then gives a good-sized anterior peroneal branch to the front of the leg between the tibia and fibula below the interosseous mem- brane, which will be afterwards dis- sected ; and a communicating branch to join that from the posterior tibial. The peroneal artery ends below the ex- ternal malleolus by anastomosing with the malleolar and plantar arteries. 2. Muscular branches are given to the deep muscles and also to the soleus.

A portion of the skin on the inner side of the heel and sole of the foot is to be reflected if necessary, so as to expose the whole breadth of the internal annular ligament, which stretches from the inner malleolus to the os calcis and gives origin by its lower border to one head of the abductor pollicis. The divisions in the annular ligament are four in number, and are occupied as follows, beginning from the tibia. In the first division is the tibialis posticus ; in the second the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum; in the third the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, though this nerve is generally divided; and in the fourth the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis* but this last lies so deeply in order to pass in the grooves in the astragalus and os calcis that it is not readily seen from the side.

The Plantar Fascia (Fig. 66 2) closely resembles the fascia of'the palm, and is divisible into threeportions. The central, which is the strongest, is attached to the under surface of the great tuber- osity of the os calcis,but expands as it passes forwards to nearly the entire width of the foot. It splits into five portions opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and at this point distinct trans- verse fibres will be seen passing across the foot. The five processes are attached to the sheaths of the flexor tendons of each toe and between them the several digital vessels and nerves pass. A transverse ligament has been described in the skin of the web of the toes, passing over the digi- tal vessels and nerves.

The centrcal portion of the fascia gives origin to muscular fibres "by its deep surface, and also by two intermuscular septa which will subsequently be seen on each side of the flexor brevis digitorum. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are much thinner than that m the centre, and mainly cover the muscles of the great and little toes on the inner and outer sides of the foot, but there is also a strong band on the outer side running from the outer tubercle of the calcaneuni to the base of fifth metatarsal bone. [The central portion of the fascia is to be cut across about two inches from, the heel and may then be turned down over the toes without injuring the digital nerves, when the flexor brevis digitorum will be exposed m part and the intermuscular septa on each side may be seen. The lateral portions of the fascia are1 to be removed and the abductor pollicis and abductor minimi digiti cleaned ] The First Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis digi- torum in the middle, the abductor pollicis to the inner side, and the abductor ininiini digiti to the outer side. The Flexor Brevis Digitorum (Fig. 67, 5) arises from the great tuberosity of the os calcis ; from the plantar fascia covering it (which has therefore been left undisturbed); and from the intermuscular septa on each side. It divides into four tendons, which pass through tendinous sheaths on the under surfaces of the four smaller toes, and are mserted each by two slips, into the bases of their second phalanges. Passing between the subdivisions of each tendon is the corresponding tendon of the long flexor, which goes to the terminal phalanx ; and thus the arrangement is precisely similar to that found in the hand, and he flex0r brevis might be spoken of ^ perforates, and the flexor longus as perforans.

Its tendon is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe.* The actions of the superficial muscles of the foot are sufficiently indicated by their names, but it should be remarked that abduction and adduction are from and to the median plane of the foot and not of the body. The flexor brevis digitorum and abductor pollicis are supplied by the internal plantar nerve ; the abductor minimi digiti by the external plantar nerve. [To bring the deeper parts into view, the best way will be to remove with the saw a thin slice of the os calcis, including the attach- ments of the superficial muscles, when, if the attachment of the abductor pollicis to the internal annular ligament be divided, they can be turned forwards, and the plantar nerves and vessels will be •seen.] The Plantar Arteries (Fig. 68) internal and external, are the terminal branches of the posterior tibial, and enter the foot beneath the abductor pollicis in close relation with the plantar nerves. The internal plantar artery, which is the smaller of the two, is accompanied by the large internal plantar nerve, the large external plantar artery going with the smaller external nerve. The Internal plantar artery (6) is usually of small size, and runs forward to the great toe, where it gives digital arteries to the great and one side of the second toe, and anastomoses with the dorsal artery of the foot. If well-injected it may sometimes be traced with the nerve to the third interosseous space, giving muscular branches and digital branches to the three inner toes. Two vena comites accompany it. The External plantar artery (7) runs obliquely outwards across the loot between the flexor brevis digitorum and the accessorius muscle, and turning round the outer border of the latter muscle, takes a deep course inwards towards the great toe, where it will be subse- quently traced. It is accompanied by the external plantar nerve which also gives a deep branch across the foot, and by vence comites ' and supplies the adjacent muscles, giving a branch to the outer side oi the loot to anastomose with the peroneal artery. The Plantar Nerves (Fig. 69) internal and external, are the136 SOLE OF THE FOOT. branches of the posterior tibial nerve ; their relation to the arteries ^""^ L> (5) ^ of thet.0 d * the abductor pollicis ^^^^Z Fig. 69. side of the great toe, and breaks up into three other digital branches ; each of these hifur- cates at the roots of the toes, and they thus supply the outer side of the great toe, both sides of the second and third toes, and half the fourth toe. The nerve also gives muscular branches to the flexor brevis pollicis and the two inner lunibricales muscles, and cutaneous branches to the sole. The External plantar nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in front of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and ac- cessorius in its course. At the outer border of the accessorius 1 divides into superficial and deep portions, the deep accompanying the artery.

A slender branch of communication between the internal and external plantar nerves may sometimes be found. It may be noticed that the nerves of the sole of the foot closely resemble those of the palm of the hand in their distribution, the internal plantar corresponding to the median, and the external plantar to the ulnar nerve ; the deep branches of the latter nerves also correspond. The Second Layer of Muscles includes the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, with the small accessorius and iumbricales muscles, all of which should now be cleaned. _ The tendon of the Flexor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 70, 3) is single at the annular ligament and lies to the inner side of the vessels and nerves, but it will now be seen to cross beneath them and over the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis to the centre of the foot, where it has the fibres of the accessorius attached to its deep surface. It then divides into four tendons, which give origin to the lumbricales muscles and pass beneath the digital nerves to the four small toes where they enter the digital sheaths, lying beneath the tendons of the short flexor. Each deep tendon then passes through the slit in the superficial tendon, and is inserted into the base of the third or terminal phalanx. The Accessorius (Fig. 69, 8) arises from the under surface of the os calcis by two heads, between which the long plantar ligament is seen The inner head, which is fleshy and the larger of the two, is attached to the hollow in front of the greater tuberosity ; the outer head, which is tendinous, is attached to the bone in front of the lesser tuberosity and to the long plantar ligament. The muscle is inserted into the deep surface of the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, or rather, is connected with it, and then sends slips to the tendons con- nected with the second, third, and fourth toes. The Lumbricales (Fig. 67, 7) are four small muscles, which are so named from their fancied resemblance to earth-worms. They arise from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum,-the most internal from one, and the rest from two tendons each,-and wind to the mner sides of the four small toes to reach their dorsal aspects, where they join the expansions of the extensor tendons. The action of the accessorius is to bring the line of traction of the flexor tendons into the centre of the foot. The use of the lumbricales d0uUM' but accor^g to Duchenne is similar to that0 th ■SOLE OF THE FOOT. 5. Flexor brevis pollicis. o5 Fig. 70. interossei. The accessories is supplied by the external P^ar n-ve ; the two inner lumhricales by the internal plantar, and the Uo outer lumbricales by the external plantar nerve. The tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 70 4) alter lvincr in the -roove below the lesser process of the os calcis, runs &ard to th^ great toe, lying beneath the nerves, and being crossed by the tendon of the which it is connected by a lew nores. ine tendon lies between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis and then enters a sheath, in which it is enclosed until its insertion into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great toe. [The long tendons and the accessorius miscle are to be cut about the middle of the Sot and turned down, when the muscles of the third layer are to be cleaned.] The Third Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversa ^The Plexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 70, 5) arises by a narrow tendinous origin from the under surface of the external cuneiform bone and adjacent surface of the cuboid, and 1 connected with the insertion of the tibiahs posticus.

The Adductor Pollicis (Fig. 70, 6) arises from the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, and from the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon; and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx: of the great toe, with the outer head of the flexor brevis. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 70, 7) arises .from the under surface of the projecting base of the fifth metatarsal bone and the sheath of the peroneus longus, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe with the abductor.* The Transversus Pedis (Fig. 70, 8) is of variable size, and con- sists of three or four small bundles, which arise from the transverse metatarsal ligament over the heads of the three or four outer meta- tarsal bones. It is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the great toe with the adductor and part of the flexor brevis pollicis. The action of the flexor brevis pollicis and flexor minimi digiti is obvious; the adductor pollicis.acts towards the median plane of the foot, and the transversus draws the toes together and narrows the foot. The flexor brevis pollicis is supplied by the internal plantar nerve, the other muscles by the external plantar nerve. [The adductor and flexor brevis pollicis are to be cut near their origins and turned down, when the plantar arch of the external plantar artery with the accompanying nerve is to be fully traced out.] The External Plantar Artery (Fig. 68, 8) after turning round the accessorius muscle takes a deep course beneath the adductor and flexor brevis pollicis, but upon the interosseous muscles, to the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.. This deep portion of the artery has been called the plantar arch, which is completed by the communicating branch of the dorsal artery of the foot entering the sole between the first and second metatarsal bones. Branches.—Three small posterior perforating arteries are given off by the plantar arch, which pierce the interosseous muscles to anasto- mose with the interosseous arteries on the dorsum. Four digital arteries arise from the anterior part of the arch ; the outer one goes to the outer side of the little toe, the others bifurcate to supply the adjacent sides of two toes each, and at the point of bifurcation send anterior perforating arteries to the back of the foot The digital arteries run on the sides of the toes with the digital nerves, and anastomose in the pulp of the terminal phalanx The communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis artery enters the be*iowdPP°nenS miniMi dm attaChed t0 the metata^l ^ne may occasionally140 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. sole between the heads of the first dorsal'interosseous muscle, and besides completing the plantar arch, gives off the artena magna pollicis, which bifurcates to sup- Fig. 71.

The External Plantar Nerve (Fig. 71, 5)—The deep portion of the nerve accompanies the artery beneath the adductor pollicis, in which it ends. In its course it gives small branches to the two outer himbricales, to the transversus pedis, and to all the interosseous muscles both plantar and dorsal, except those of the fourth or outermost inter- osseous space, which are supplied by the superficial portion. The Fourth Layer of Muscles consists of the plantar interossei, which will be better seen when the dorsal interossei are dissected. Front of the Leg and Foot.

The internal saphena vein is to "be traced in front of the internal malleolus to the inner side of the knee. Cutaneous Nerves.—On the outer side of the leg are a few cutaneous branches from the external popliteal nerve. The Musculocutaneous Nerve (Fig. 75, 13) pierces the deep fascia about the lower third of the outer side of the leg, and at once divides into two branches, which however often appear at different points. The internal division (15) gives branches to the inner side of the great toe, the outer side of the second, and the inner side of the third toe ; frequently also giving a small branch to join the anterior tibial nerve between the first and second toes. The outer division (17) supplies the outer side of the third toe, both sides of the fourth, and either one or both sides of the fifth toe. The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 75, 21) winds round the external malleolus from the back of the leg, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; or occasionally to both sides of the little toe and half the next, joining the musculo-cutaneous nerve The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 75, 16) appears in the interval between the great and the second toes, the adjacent sides of which it supplies, often joining with a branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Internal Saphenous Nerve lies in front of the internal malleolus with the saphena vein, which it accompanies. It may be traced along the inner side of the foot, bat is of small size The Fascia of the leg is dense and white, and is attached to the tibia on the inner side and to the fibula on the outer side, forming an intermuscular septum between the extensor and the peroneal irtr I grs, f?n *° muscuiar fiires at ^ ^ of the leg where it should therefore be allowed to remain undisturbed ■ the m farrhOTld be rem0TCd> ««Pt a thickened hand over he ankle joint the anterior annular ligament.

The muscles, vessels, and nerves are to be cleaned. The Extensor Muscles (Fig. 72) are tibialis anticus to the inner side ; the extensor longus digitorum with an extra slip (the peroneus tertius) to the outer side ; and between the two, the extensor proprius pollicis appearing about the middle of the leg. The Tibialis Anticus (Fig. 72,3) arises from the upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the tibia and from its outer tuberosity ; from the inner half of the interosseous ligament for the same distance; and from the fascia covering the muscle. The fibres end in a broad tendon, which becomes narrower near the ankle and passes through the most inter- nal division of the annular ligament, to be inserted into the under surface of the internal cuneiform bone and the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The tibialis anticus is a flexor of the foot and draws up its inner side. It is one ol the tendons which helps to produce the form of club-foot called 'talipes varus.' It is supplied bv the anterior tibial nerve. The Extensor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 72, 4) arises from the upper three- fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula (see note, p. 126), and for about an inch from the adjacent interosseous mem- brane ; from the outer tuberosity of the tibia close to the tibialis anticus ; from the fascia upon the^pperpartjf^ ^Mn^Tofl^^ (from Wilson). • i0j q Q Borders of the solens muscle 1.

The mus- cular fibres are continued upon the tendon to the annular ligament,, through the outer division of which it passes, and at once°divide& into four tendons for the four smaller toes. The insertion of the extensors into the toes is similar to that of the extensors of the fingers, but on a smaller scale. The extensor tendons form an expansion on the back of the first phalanx of each toe, which is joined by the tendons of the corresponding lumbricalis and interossei muscles, and m the case of the second, third, and fourth toes, by the tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum ; this is continued forwards, the central triangular portion going to the second phalanx and the lateral stronger pieces to the third phalanx. The action of the extensor longus digitorum is principally to flex and abduct the foot, since it only extends the first phalanges of the toes, by means of short fibres connecting each tendon with the corresponding bone (Fi<* 73 3) The expansion on the second and third phalanges is connected with the interossei and lumbricales, which are the extensors of the second and third phalanges. (Compare the description of the fingers, p. 51 > The Peroneus Tertius (Fig. 72, 6) is often a part of the extensor longus digitorum.

As there is no definite guide to the outer border of the tibialis, it is well to make the incision a little obliquely and not less than four inches long, beginning about one inch below the head of the fibula, at a point midway between the bone and the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The fascia should be di- vided in the same direc- tion as the skin, when, if the fore-finger is intro- duced into the wound, it will probably pass into the cellular interval between the two muscles, there "being no intermuscular septum or white line to guide the operator, though these are commonly men- tioned.

The Tarsal artery arises immediately below the annular ligament, and crosses the foot beneath the extensor brevis digitorum to anas- tomose with the arteries about the external malleolus. The Metatarsal artery arises lower than the preceding and near the bases of the metatarsal bones. It also runs outwards beneath the extensor brevis digitorum, and gives off three interosseous branches to the outer spaces. These run forward upon the interossei muscles, and bifurcate at the roots of the toes to supply the adjacent sides of two toes each, the outer one giving off a branch also to the outer side of the little toe. The anterior and posterior perforating arteries of the plantar arch join these interosseous arteries at their origins and points of bifurcation. The Communicating branch passes between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to the sole of the foot, where it joins the plantar arch (p. 139). The Dorsalis Pollicis (vel hallucis) artery runs forward upon the great toe and, after giving a branch to its inner side, bifurcates to supply the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 75,4) is a branch of the external popliteal nerve, and reaches the anterior tibial artery by piercing the fibres of the extensor longus digitorum. It lies to the outer side of the artery m the upper part of the leg, but crosses it about the middle reaching its outer side again at the ankle. Its muscular relations are the same as those of the artery, with which it passes under the annular ligament. In the leg it supplies the four extensor muscles, and as soon as it enters the foot divides into two branches The outer branch (19) is distributed to the extensor brevis digitorum and the articulations of the foot and ankle joint, having upon it a gangli- form enlargement; the inner branch (16) lies to the outer side of the dorsal artery, and becomes cutaneous in the interval between the great toe and next, the adjacent sides of which it supplies. /^SS muscles are to be exposed on the outer side of the ™u7 movin§1 ^fascia covering them, when a strong intermus- cular septum will be found attached to the fibula on each? sideSepa- rating them from the muscles of the front and back of the it 11 portion of the fascia is to be left below the malleolus to fonn in external annular ligament.] 1 an The Peroneus Longus (Fig. 72, 7) arises from the upper half of he outer surface of the fibula ; from the intermuscular s pta on each pide, and from the fascia.

Though considered anatomically as adductors and abductors, all the muscles by their connection with the extensor tendons are flexors of the first and extensors of the second and third phalanges (v. p. 143). The Knee-Joint. The knee is a good example of ginglymus or hinge-joint, the move- ment taking place between the femur and the tibia, and the patella gliding upon the former bone. It is remarkable for having inter- articular fibro-cartilages, and its synovial membrane is the most extensive in the body. The knee-joint has in front the expansion of the extensor muscles which help to form its capsular ligament, and in front of the patella is a bursa. Behind the joint are the popliteal artery, vein, and nerves, with the two heads of the gastrocnemius and the popliteus. To the inner side of the joint, but posterior to it, are the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, semi-tendinosus, and semi-membranosus ; and the biceps occupies a similar position on the outer side. The ligaments of the knee may conveniently be divided into extra- and intra-articular. The Extra-articular Ligaments are anterior, posterior, two lateral, and capsular. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 79, 3) is the ligamentum patella, which is a broad band reaching from the lower margin of the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, and forming part of the insertion of the quadriceps extensor. The expansions of the vasti muscles on each side form an additional covering to the front of the joint and become incorporated with its capsule. Between the ligament and the head of the tibia is a bursa, which must not be confounded with the proper bursa patella in front of the bone. [To see the remaining ligaments, the popliteal vessels and nerves and the remains of the gastrocnemius and plantaris must be removed. I he tendons of the biceps, semi-membranosus, and popliteus are to be traced out fully, and should be carefully preserved, but cut short.] The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 80, 1) (ligamentum posticum Winslowii) is closely connected with the tendon of the semi-mem- branosus, from which a large band of fibres passes obliquely upwards and outwards across the back of the joint, superficially to the fibres of the capsular ligament. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 80, 6 & 7) is divided152 LIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. into two portions, the long and short, the long being the anterior one of the two The divisions of the tendon of the biceps embrace the Ion- ligament, and must be divided to expose it thoroughly. It is a round cord attached to the side of the external condyle immediately Fig. 79. Fig. 80. above the depression for the popliteus, and to the outer side of the head of the fibula. The tendon of the popliteus and the external inferior articular artery have been traced beneath it. The short ligament, which is derived from the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is placed behind the long, and reaches from the condyle to the head of the fibula, but it is often very indistinct. . , The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 79, 5) « * broad band closely connected with the capsular ligament.

The Capsular Ligament is a fibrous layer closely connected with the exterior of the synovial membrane and the inter-articular carti- lages, being attached to the margin of the articular surface of the tibia below, and above to the fascia lata and an expansion from the vasti. It blends with the posterior and internal lateral ligaments, and encloses the ligamentmn patellae and the external lateral ligament; it is strengthened by expansions from the several tendons, but is pierced by the tendon of the popliteus. [The tendon of the rectus is to be divided and drawn down in order to see the extent of the synovial membrane above the patella, since it reaches for a couple of inches above the articular surface of the femur and gives attachment to the Subcrureus, a small muscle arising from the lower part of the anterior surface of the femur. The synovial membrane is then to be divided on each side, as near the condyles as possible, and the patella turned down, when the ligamenta mucosum et alaria will be seen.] The Ligamentum Mucosum (Fig. 82, 10) is a process of synovial membrane attached to the notch between the condyles, from which it stretches to immediately below the patella. The Ligamenta Alaria (Fig. 82, 9) are two folds of synovial membrane with fringed borders, which are seen on each side of the ligamentum mucosum. [The ligamentum mucosum is to be divided and the patella turned down completely, when the bursa of the ligamentum patellae can be opened and seen. The capsular and posterior ligaments are to be removed, but the lateral ligaments are to be preserved and the crucial ligaments dissected.] The Intra-articular Ligaments are the two crucial, the coronary, and the transverse ligaments. Within the joint also are the two semi- lunar cartilages. The Anterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 81, 2) is attached to the external condyle of the femur at its inner and back part, and passes oblkmely across the joint to be inserted into the top of the tibia in front of the spine, between the attachments of the internal and external semilunar cartilages, with the latter of which it is closely connected.154 LIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. The Posterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 81, 3) loader and stouter than the anterior. It is attached to the internal condyle at its anterior and outer part, and passes nearly vertically to the poste- rior margin of the top of the tibia and popliteal notch, being closely connected with the posterior extremity of the internal semilunar The° crucial ligaments would alternately check extreme flexion and extension, the anterior ligament becoming tightened when the knee joint is extended, and the posterior when the knee is ^7/the lateral ligaments are now divided, it will be found that the femur and tibia become more separated than before, showing that the obiect of the crucial ligaments is not simply to maintain the articular surfaces in apposition. It will also be seen that whilst rotation of the tibia outwards can now be carried to an extreme degree (so as to bring the crucial ligaments almost parallel), rotation inwards is im- mediately checked by the crossing of the ligaments and it .is thus that the tendency of the popliteus muscle to rotate the leg inwards is counterbalanced. . The Transverse Ligament (Fig. 81, 4) is a small band connect- ing the anterior extremities of the semilunar cartilages, and often not distinct. _r . The Semilunar Cartilages (Fig. 81) can be partly seen now, but will be fully exposed by dividing the crucial ligaments. _ lney are nbro-cartilages which are thicker at the outer than at the inner mar- gins, and which serve to deepen the condyloid cavities on the top of the tibia, being attached to the margin of the bone by short hbres called the coronary ligaments. The extremities of each cartilage are fixed respectively in front of and behind the spine of the tibia, by short strong bands of fibrous, tissue. The Internal Semilunar Cartilage (Fig. 81, 6) is oval m form and embraces the extremities of the external cartilage. Its anterior extremity is attached to the tibia in front of the anterior crucial l.ga- mentrihe posterior extremity is attached in front of the posterior "Slfi Semilunar Cartilage (Fig. 81 7) is nearly circu- lar ; its anterior extremity is attached to the tibia .front of the spine, and is connected with the insertion of the antenor crucial ligament.

The Synovial Membrane (Fig. 82) extends for at least two inches above the articular surface of the femur, forming a pouch beneath the extensor muscles. It is reflected from the articular surface of the femur over the crucial ligaments to the articular surface of the tibia, covering both aspects of the semilunar cartilages and then lines the capsular ligament. It gives a tube around the tendon of the popliteus where it is within the capsule, and has already been seen to form the ligamentum mucosum and Ugamenta alaria. Tibio-Fibular Articulations. TThe whole of the muscular fibres connected with the bones of the lei and lot must be removed, but the tendinous insertions about the foot should be kept to be examined with the ligaments.] The Superior tibio-fibular articulation (Fig. 81) is a simple arthro- dial joint, the synovial membrane of which is occasionally continuous with that of the knee. The anterior and posterior ligaments are short bands connecting the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the fibula with the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The Middle tibio-fibular articulation is formed by the interosseous ligament or membrane, which is the great bond between the shafts of the bones ol the leg, its fibres running downwards from the tibia to the fibula. It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones in all their lower parts, a hole being made above by the passage of the anterior tibial vessels. The membrane has an opening in it near the lower part, through which the anterior peroneal artery reaches the front of the Fig. 83. leg.

Below the interosseous membrane is the inferior interosseous liga- ment, which consists of very short fibres passing between the tri- angular rough impressions on the adjacent surfaces of the tibia and fibula, immediately above their inferior articulation. The Inferior tibio-fibular articulation (Fig. 83) is a simple arthro- dial joint continuous with the ankle-joint. It has anterior and pos- terior ligaments between the two bones resembling those above, and, in addition, placed below the posterior and distinct from it, a trans- verse (or inferior) ligament (3) which reaches from the external malleolus to the posterior surface and malleolus of the tibia, forming part of the true ankle-joint. Ankle-Joint and Articulations op the Foot. The ankle-joint is a hinge joint capable of limited lateral motion when the toes are pointed. It has in front the tendons of the tibialis anticus, the tibial vessels and nerve, the extensor proprius pollicis, and the extensor longus digitorum with the peroneus tertius. Behind, to the inner side are the tendons of the tibialis posticus, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve (or it maybe the plantar vessels and nerves); the flexor longus pollicis near the middle ; and to the outer side, the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis (Fig. 65). The ankle-joint has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 84, 7) is a broad membrane which is seldom seen entire. It is attached to the lower margin of the tibia, and to the superior surface of the astragalus, close to its head and joining the lateral ligament on each side. The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 83, 7) is not described by many authors, and is little more than a few fibres stretching over the syno- vial membrane between the back of the tibia and the astragalus. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 84, 6) is triangular in shape, and hence has been called deltoid. The apex is attached to the extremity of the internal malleolus, and the base to the posterior part of the astragalus, to the lesser process of the os calcis, and the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone. A strong deep portion passes from the apex of the malleolus to the side of the astragalus. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 85) consists of three slips ; two horizontal attached to the astragalus, and one, more or less vertical, to the os calcis. The anterior slip (6) is attached to the front of the external malleolus and to the side of the astracralus in front of the superior articular surface ; the middle (7) is a round cord which reaches backwards from the tip of the malleolus to the outer158 LIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. side of the os calcis about its middle ; the posterior (8) is attached to the deep groove behind the articular surface of the external malleolus, Fig. 84. Fig. 85. and passes horizontally to the posterior surface of the astragalus behind the articulation with the tibia (Fig. 83, 5). The Calcaneo-astragaloid Articulation has external, posterior, and interosseous ligaments. The external is a short band passing obliquely backwards from the side of the astragalus to the upper margin of the greater process of the os calcis. The posterior is placed between the posterior parts of the two bones, close to the groove in the astragalus through which the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis passes. The interosseous ligament will be seen when the joint is opened. It is a strong thick band, passing from the groove between the two inferior articular surfaces of the astragalus, to the cor- responding groove between the two convex articular surfaces on the superior aspect of the calcaneum. The tendon of the tibialis posticus is to be fully traced out now, and Fig> 84.—Internal view of the ankle-joint (from Wilson) 1. Internal malleolus of the tibia. 2. 2. Astragalus. 3. Os calcis. 4'.

Fig. 86. will be found to have a fibro-cartilage developed in it where it passes under the head of the astragalus, and to be principally attached to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the adjacent internal cuneiform bone, giving slips also to all the adjacent bones of the tarsus (with the exception of the astragalus), and to the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. These must be removed to see the true ligaments of the joints. Ligaments of the Tarsus. On the dorsal aspect of the remaining tarsal bones will be found a number of short bands or fibres which pass between adjacent bones, and have received names as ligaments accordingly. On the plantar aspect there are similar liga- ments, three only of which are worthy of special notice, viz., the long and short calcaneo-cuboid ligaments, and the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The Long Calcaneo-Cuboid Ligament (Fig. 86, 4)—ligamentum longum plantce—is a broad ligament, which has been already seen in the dissection of the sole of the foot. It is extensively attached to the under surface of the os calcis in front of the tuberosities, and passes forward to be attached to the posterior margin of the peroneal groove in the cuboid bone. Some of the fibres pass on over the tendon of the peroneus (to which they form a sheath), and are attached to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. The Short Calcaneo-Cuboid Ligament (Fig. 86, 5) lies to the inner side of the long ligament, and is more deeply placed. It reaches from the tubercle on the under surface of the greater process 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 7. 8, 9, Fig. 86.—Ligaments of the sole of the foot (from Wilson). Os calcis. Astragalus.

Numerous interosseous ligaments bind the bones of the tarsus firmly together, and will be seen when the joints are opened. The Metatarsal Bones (Fig. 86, 9) are connected with the tarsus bv strong dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal ligaments are one to each metatarsal bone from the arsal bone with which it articulates ; but the second metatarsal, m additmn to its ligament from the middle cuneiform, has extra slips&oml the internal and external cuneiform bones, between which its base is WThe plantar ligaments are less regular, and are united with the slips from the calcaneocuboid ligament. i^-u+w The interosseous ligaments are short strong bands, and vary sligntiy in different subjects. There is always one between the interna cuneiform and the second metatarsal bone ; a second may exist between the external cuneiform and the same metatarsal bone ; and a third between the external cuneiform and the fourth metatarsal bone "Transverse dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments connect the bases of the metatarsal bones. * The Synovial Membranes (Fig. 87) of the foot, including the ankle-joint, are seven in number, and will be seen by opening the Rpveral ioints in succession. The 1st is the synovial membrane of the ankle (1), reflected over the upper surface of the astragalus, and upon the ligaments to the articular surfaces of the tibia and fibula ; it passes also between the tibia and fibula into the inferior tibio-fibular articulation The 2nd synovial membrane lines the posterior calcaneo-astraga ■loid articulation (11). , j The 3rd synovial membrane covers the head of the as ragal^ ad the concave surface of the scaphoid, being prolonged backwards into the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation (ill).

It is attached to the deep groove found between the two articulations in each bone. An interosseous ligament will also be seen, when the astragalus is displaced, passing from the upper border Fig. 87. of the greater process of the os calcis to the cuboid and scaphoid bones. • The 4th synovial membrane (iv) is placed between the greater process of the os calcis and the back of the cuboid bone, and, when it is opened, the peculiar manner in which the two bones are locked together will be seen. An interosseous ligament will be found between the os calcis and cuboid bone to the inner side of the synovial cavity. The 5th synovial membrane (v) is between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and will be found to pass between the middle and external cuneiform bones to their anterior surfaces, and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones (vn). It is also prolonged into the articulations between the second, third, and Fig. 87.-Section to show the seven synovial membranes of the foot (from Wilson). v 9* T!,+?.o'„„■!„,. 8.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. [The Student is requested to read the 'Introduction' before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.~\ Surgery.-Before the subject is tied up for the dissection of the perineum, the student should practise the operation of introducing the catheter. , In the case of the Male Subject the operator should stand on the left side of the body, and having oiled a perfectly smooth and clean staff or sound, should grasp the end of the penis with the left hand, and draw it upwards so as to stretch the^ urethra whdst introducing the instrument. The sound is to be held hghtly m the right hand, and is to be passed at first along the fold of the groin, bitt when it has entered the urethra for a few inches it is to be brought parallel to the median line of the body The mtroduction of an" instrument is more difficult on the dead than on the living body, owing to the want of the mucous secretion of the urethra and the relaxed Condition of the canal; and it is advisable therefore to withdraw the instrument and oil it afresh if any obstruction should When an obstruction to entering the bladder occurs, he left hand should be placed upon the perineum at the point to ^ch the s aft has reached, and may be made to grasp the urethra and guide the instrument in its right course. _ 1lQ11fllp ;„ to When the point of the staff has passed the bulb, the handle "to be depressed between the thighs, and the point of the probably enter the bladder. If it is found impossible to depress he handle, the student may be certain that he has WeU^e triangular ligament, and should be very gentle in his °^ or he will very probably perforate the bulb. By a series o very cautious efforts, aided by the left hand on the pennamm, the stattTHE PERINEUM. 167 may at least be passed, or if an organic stricture should exist, it will be necessary to use a smaller instrument. When the handle of the instrument can be depressed between the thighs, the student may judge of its having entered the bladder by the readiness with which it passed, and by the ease with which the end of the staff can be rotated in the bladder. In all cases, however, it is advisable for the student to introduce his left fore-finger into the rectum, in order to ascertain that the instrument is not in a false passage, and also in order to appreciate the thickness of the coats of the bladder, the size of the prostate, and the course the catheter would take on the living body. In the Female Subject it will be advisable to examine the position of the urethra by separating the labia, before attempting to introduce an elastic catheter. It will be seen that the orifice of the urethra is separated from the clitoris by the space known as the vestibule, and that it is close above the entrance to the vagina. To pass the catheter, the student should stand on the right side of the subject, and having passed the left fore-finger between the thighs and labia, should place it at the anterior edge of the orifice of the vagina; the flexible catheter being then passed along the fore-finger can be slightly raised so as to enter the urethra, and will be felt in its passage through that canal by the finger at the orifice of the vagina. It will be well to practise the operation once or twice with the parts exposed to view, and then to repeat it with a cloth thrown over the pubes, as would be done in actual practice. The Perineum. [The perineeum is now to be fully exposed by bringing the buttocks of the subject to the edge of the table, where they are to be raised upon a block. The thighs are then to be flexed upon the abdomen, with the legs bent; and the body is to be secured upon the table with a cord passing beneath it from one knee to the other, a block being placed lengthways between the knees to keep them sufficiently apart. The staff' is to be retained in the male urethra, and secured in its place by tying a loop of string round the penis, and fastening it to the handle of the staff.] External Appearances.—In the male the skin is of a darker tint than that of the rest of the body, and is more or less covered with hair, which should be removed. In front will be found the scrotum, containing the two testes, and obscuring at present the root of the penis and deeper portion of the urethra. Behind theTHE PEKINiEUM. 168 scrotum is the anus or orifice of the bowel, and between the two is the true perineum, which will be seen to be marked by a median raphe. Around the anus the skin is thrown into folds, which it enlarged, form one variety of external piles. By drawing the anus slightly open, a white line will be seen, marking the junction of the skin with the mucous membrane, and corresponding to the separation between the internal and external sphincter muscles ^illie'femcde (Fig. 92) the scrotum may be considered to be split in the median line, to form the two labia majora, which however consist simply of cellular tissue and fat, and are continuous above with the mons Veneris, a thickened portion of the integument oyer the pubes (only partially seen in this view). The labia are united in front by the anterior commissure; they bound the vulva and are continued backwards to the anterior boundary of the perimeum, where they are united by the posterior commissure In z lemale who has not borne children, a small transverse fold of mucous membrane may be seen just within the posterior coinmissure, which is called the fourchette, and between the two is the fossa By separating the labia the clitoris will be seen at the upper part of the vulva, resembling a diminutive penis in appearance and struc- ture, and having a small and ill-defined glans and prepuce. The numphce or labia minora extend obliquely downwards trom each side of the clitoris, being connected both with the organ itself and its prepuce, and are lost in the labia majora and wall.of the vasina below. „ ,, r. • The vestibule is a triangular interval, with the apex at the cbtoris and the base at the orifice of the vagina, the sides being formed by the nymph*. An inch below the clitoris is the meatus urmanus, which is slightly prominent, and is placed immediately above the orifice of the vagina. The entrance of the vagina may be more or less occluded by a Jwmen which is a reduplication of mucous membrane, usually at a cret entl form with the concave border _ upwards The; myrtiformes are three or four little projections from the vaginal wall behind the hymen, and are independent of that membrane On each side of the vagina immediately in front of the ^%°***^™> are the orifices of the vulvo-vaginal glands or glands of Bartholin._lhe orifices of numerous sebaceous follicles will also be found scattered over the vulva. , • „ The true perineum of the female is between the posterior commas-169 THE PERINEUM. sure of the labia and the anal orifice, and is from an inch to an inch- and-a-half long, but becomes considerably elongated during labour. The finger should be introduced into the vagina , to ascertain the position and condition of the cervix and os uteri. Boundaries of the Perinseum.—These are the same in both sexes, and can be best ascertained by placing a pelvis, on which the ligaments are preserved, in the same position as the subject, when the space under examination will be seen to correspond with the in- ferior aperture of the pelvis. In front is the symphysis pubis, with the divergent rami extending to the tuberosities of the ischia, which form the lateral boundaries. Posteriorly the great sacro-sciatic liga- ments extend to the sacrum, but in the recent subject the margins of the glutei maximi muscles overlap these and reach to the coccyx, which is the posterior limit of the space. The perinseum has been generally considered to resemble the heraldic lozenge, but has more aptly been compared to an inverted ace-of-hearts (Thompson). The inferior aperture of the pelvis is larger in the female than in the male, but considerable variation in the space between the rami of the pubes will be found in different individuals. The perinseal space may be conveniently divided into halves, by a line passing from the anterior border of one tuberosity of the ischium to the other ; the anterior or urethral half contains the urino-genital organs, and the posterior or rectal half the lower extremity of the bowel. Posterior Space in both Sexes. [A little cotton-wool is to be introduced into the rectum, and the anus is then to be carefully sewn up, the stitches being placed as near the white line mentioned above as possible. A transverse incision is then to be made in front of the anus, connecting the two tuberosities, and a similar one across the lower extremity of the coccyx. These are to be joined by incisions carried round the anus as near the sutures as possible, and the skin is to be reflected on each side.] The Sphincter Ani (Pig. 88, 16) (external) surrounds the anus and is close beneath the skin. It consists of two symmetrical halves, which are attached to the tip of the coccyx behind, and meet in front of the anus at the < central point of the perinseum.' The external sphincter controls the lower end of the bowel, and is supplied by the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve and by a branch of the fourth sacral nerve. The Internal Sphincter cannot be seen at present. It is merelyTHE PERINEUM. 170 a thickened band of the nnstriped circular fibres of the rectum, and differs therefore in structure from the external sphincter, which is a voluntary muscle. TThe edse of the gluteus maximus is now to be defined, since it foiL the boundary of the dissection; it will .be found extending obliquely upwards and outwards (m this position) irom the tip ol the coccyx. The fat filling the space between the anus and the edge of the muscle is to be carefully removed piecemeal, care being taken to preserve the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels and nerve which run nearly transversely towards the bowel, and also a little branch of the fourth sacral nerve near the posterior part of the space, or ischio-rectal fossa.] The Ischio-rectal Fossa (Fig. 88) is the space on each side of the rectum, bounded behind by the gluteus maximus muscle and great sacro-sciatic ligament, in front by the pubes and triangular ligament. Its deep boundaries are, on the- inner side the levator am muscle, which slings the rectum, and has an oblique direction towards the middle line ; and on the order side, the obturator interims lying on the internal surface of the thyroid foramen. Both these muscles are covered by processes of fascia derived from the pelvic fascia ; that covering the obturator muscle being called the obturator fasaa, and that upon the levator ani being the anal fascia (see diagram of pelvic fascia). When the finger is pushed into this space, it is Prevented from entering the pelvis by the reflection of this fascia upon the two muscles, and on the surface of the body the fossa corresponds to the space between the anus and the tuber ischii. The ischio-rectal fossa is filled with loose granular fat, which is traversed by the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels and nerve On the outer side of^the space and behind the margin of the pubes, he pudic vessels and nerves, which afterwards pass forward through the an- terior part of the space, can be felt enclosed m a tube of fascia ; and it is here that the artery can be effectually compressed in cases of 'hfPTnorrhao'e after lithotomy. , sTiery -The tissues in the ischio-rectal fossa are more or less Wvfd in the several forms of fistula in ano, and the together with some of the fat and a small branch of art y will be more or less divided in the ordinary operation for ^J^™. affection.

It is now seen at its insertion into the central line of the perinseum, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side both in front of and behind the rectum ; it is inserted also into the side of the rectum, and into the anterior surface of the extremity of the coccyx with the opposite muscle. The levator ani supports the pelvic viscera, and, when in contrac- tion, tends to prevent the expulsion of their contents. It may also be considered as an extraordinary muscle of expiration, since it acts upon the viscera in opposition to the diaphragm. It is supplied by the fourth sacral nerve. The Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Artery (Fig. 88, 13) arises from the pudic artery under cover of the ischium, and takes a nearly transverse Fig. 88.—Superficial dissection of r 1.

Vence comites take the same course as the artery, and join the pudic vein. The Inferior Hemorrhoidal Nerve (Fig. 88, 13) is a branch ol the internal pudic nerve, or may arise separately from the lower part of the sacral plexus. In the latter case it takes the same course as the pudic nerve and is contained in the same sheath of fascia. The nerve takes a nearly transverse course in the perineum, lying superficially to the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels, and is distributed to the external sphincter and skin of the anus, giving a branch forward to join the superficial perineal nerves. The Perinceal Branch of the fourth sacral nerve is of small size and not readily seen. It appears at the side of the coccyx by piercing the coccygeus muscle, and is distributed to the external sphincter. Anterior Space in the Male. TThe scrotum being drawn up with hooks, an incision is to be made in the median line, extending from the central point of the perineum to within three inches of the extremity of the perns. The skin is to be reflected to each side, and the testicles held out of the way with hooks.] The Superficial Fascia of the anterior half of the perineum is divisible into two layers—superficial and deep. The superficial layer of superficial fascia is continuous with the fascia over the body, which it resembles, but is peculiar in the scrotum, since there involuntary muscular fibres are developed in it, which oive it a pink appearance and constitute the dartos. * The deep layer of superficial fascia (Fig. 88, 6) is brought into view by the removal of the superficial layer, but varies considerably m appearance in different subjects, being a distinct membrane m thin subiects, but not easily defined in fat ones. _ It is continuous with the deep layer of fascia of the groin, and is attached on each side to the front of the rami of the pubes and ischium nearly to the tuberosity. It then makes a turn around tiie trans- versa* perinei muscle on each side, and joins the deep perineal fasm or triangular ligament. A pouch is thus formed containing the, bulb of the urethra with its surrounding muscles, vessels, and nerves ana this is divided into two parts by an incomplete median septum This pouch is of importance surgically with regard to extravasation of urine. If extravasation should occur from rupture of the bulbousSUPERFICIAL PERINEAL VESSELS AND NERVES. 173 or adjacent portion of the urethra, either from external violence or from the unskilful use of a catheter, the urine is effused into this pouch, and, "being prevented "by the arrangement of the fascia from running back to the anus, and by the attachment of the fascia to the rami of the pubes and ischium from extending laterally on to the thighs, it necessarily distends the pouch and creeps up into the scrotum and groin. [The deep layer of superficial fascia is to be removed, and the superficial perinseal vessels and nerves dissected out.] The Superficial Peringeal Artery (Fig. 88, 5) is a branch of the internal pudic, aud arises under cover of the ramus of the ischium, to run forwards and inwards. It enters the pouch of fascia by piercing the lower border of the triangular ligament, and then passes over or under the transversus perinsei muscle, to run forwards and supply the superficial muscles of the perinseum and the integuments of the scrotum. The Transverse Perinaeal Artery (Fig. 91, 11) is a branch of the internal pudic arising immediately in front of, or with, the pre- ceding vessel. It runs towards the median line close to the trans- versus muscle, and anastomoses with the opposite artery and with the neighbouring branches. Veins corresponding to the arteries open into the internal pudic vein. The Superficial Perinaeal Nerves (Fig. 88) are two in number, and are branches of the internal pudic nerve. The external or posterior (3) nerve has a short course in the ischio- rectal fossa, where it gives a branch to the anus. It then pierces the reflection of the deep layer of superficial fascia, and gives branches to the scrotum, forming a junction with the inferior pudendal nerve of Soemmering. The internal or anterior (7) nerve accompanies the superficial perinseal artery, either over or under the transversus perinau muscle, and is distributed to the scrotum near the median line, where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side, giving also one or two' small branches to the levator aui. The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Fig. 88, 1) (Soemmering) is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, which pierces the deep fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of the ischium. It varies a good deal in size and distribution, but generally runs inwards and forwards to the scrotum to join the external superficial perineal nerve. [The superficial vessels and nerves are to be turned aside and the174 THE MALE PERINJSUM. muscles dissected out. The accelerator urinse is in the median line, the erector penis parallel to the ramus of the puces and the trans- versa perinsei crosses between them posteriorly ; the muscles thus bounding a triangular space in which a part of the triangular liga- ment is seen.] Superficial Muscles of the Perinseum. The Accelerator Urinse (Fig. 88, 8) (ejaculator seminis or hulbo- cavernosus) is a single muscle, composed of two symmetrical halves united in the middle line by a delicate fibrous raphe. The fibres arise from the central point of the perineum and from the fibrous raphe in the middle line, and are thus inserted .--the posterior fibres which are nearly transverse in their direction, overlie the bulb and are lost upon the triangular ligament; the middle fibres enclose the urethra and corpus spongiosum ; and the anterior fibres enclose the entire penis, including the dorsal vessels. The Erector Penis (Fig. 88, io) covers the crus penis on the ramus of the os pubis. It arises from the anterior and inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, and also from the ramus of the ischium, and ends in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides of the crus penis. . . , The Transversa Perinsei (Fig. 88, 14) varies m size, and may be divided into two slips. It arises from the inner side of the ramus of the ischium, and meets its fellow muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perinseum, where it is also blended with the fibres of the accelerator urinse and sphincter ani. The action of the accelerator is to expel the contents of the urethra by its sudden and spasmodic contraction. It is not put in action during the greater part of the act of micturition ; but when the flow of urine has ceased, it serves to eject the small remaining portion or mav be used to arrest the flow of urine suddenly, when its action dves rise to considerable pain. Its action during coition is expressed bv the name ejaculator seminis, and its anterior fibres assist materi- ally in producing erection of the penis by compressing the dorsal The erector penis assists somewhat in the production of vein. erection, by compressing the corpus cavernosum.

In the first incision the surgeon cuts freely through the superficial structures, dividing the superficial perinseal and inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, and aiming at the lower part of this space, at which point the finger will feel somewhat indistinctly the staff in the urethra. The deeper incision necessarily divides the transverse muscle and artery, together with the lower part of the triangular ligament, and enables the operator to reach the staff in the mem- branous portion of the urethra. It should be noticed how the small space between the anus and the bulb of the urethra can be increased by drawing the whole penis upwards ; this fact is of importance in relation to median lithotomy, which is performed in this space, and in which operation there is some risk of wounding the bulb. It is obvious that any cutting operation in the median line of the perinseum would be accompanied by but little haemorrhage, until the vascular structure of the bulb or corpus spongiosum urethra? was reached. [The accelerator urinse is to be divided in the middle line, and dissected from the bulb beneath and from the triangular ligament, but its anterior fibres must not be interfered with. The transversus perineei is to be removed, and the erector penis detached from the bone with the crus penis, which will be seen to be a vascular body attached to the ramus of the pubes for nearly an inch. This is to be drawn forward, a branch of artery going to it being carefully pre- served ; the triangular ligament will then be exposed.] The posterior part of the Corpus Spongiosum Urethrae (Fig. 89, 6) will be seen to be a dark, vascular body, which expands to form the bulb, immediately in front of the triangular ligament. The Bulb is slightly expanded from side to side, and consists of two halves united by a delicate septum of fibrous tissue. It is closely connected with the triangular ligament, with which its delicate fibrous covering is continuous. The Anterior Triangular Ligament of the urethra or Deep Perinaeal Fascia (Fig. 89, 8) is a strong process of fibrous tissue stretching across the pubic arch, being attached to the rami of the pubes and ischium on each side behind the crura penis. The apex of the ligament is connected with the sub-pubic liga- ment, and the base has been seen to be continuous with the deep layer of superficial fascia which turns around the transversus perinaei •THE MALE PERINEUM. 176 but it is also connected with the central point of the perinseuni, and is continuous with the anal fascia over the levator ani muscle (p. 170). „ . About an inch below the pubes the urethra perforates the trian- gular ligament, with which it is inseparably united, and above this Fig. 89. point are the openings for the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis the vein being in the median Hue with the artery and nerve on each side, the last most external.

Posterior to these is a process of the pelvic fascia, forming the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, and continuous with the capsule of the prostate. Deep Muscles.—Muscular fibres having a transverse direction but varying considerably in size and distinctness, will be seen on the removal of the anterior triangular ligament. These form the com- pressor urethrse, but the lower part, when very distinct, may be called the deep transverse muscle. The Compressor vel Con- strictor Urethrse (Fig. 90, 7) (Guthrie's muscle) arises from the posterior aspect of the ramus of the pubes, and divides into two slips, which run inwards trans- versely to enclose the membranous portion of the urethra, meeting the opposite muscle in a median raphe, and being expanded upon the whole length of this portion of the canal. Circular muscular fibres surround the membranous urethra beneath the compressor, but these are in- voluntary, and continuous with the muscular fibres of the prostate (Ellis). Behind the lower portion of this muscle near the middle line is situate one of Cowper's glands, and the muscle may conceal the artery to the bulb if it should arise lower than usual.

The Deep Transverse Muscle is generally merely the lower portion of the preceding muscle, which meets its fellow of the opposite side in the median line below the urethra. [The muscular fibres are to be divided near the urethra in order to see one of Cowper's glands, and the pudic artery and nerve with their branches are to be followed out.] Cowper's Glands (Fig. 89,10) are close to the membranous portion of the urethra, one being on each side of the median line, and are most readily found by tracing to each gland a small branch from the artery to the bulb. Each gland resembles a dried pea in size and shape, but consists of numerous minute lobules. Although the gland is so close to the membranous urethra, the duct opens into the bulbous portion of the canal, being nearly an inch long and perforating the floor of the urethra very obliquely. _ The membranous portion of the urethra will be more satisfactorily examined afterwards than in the present dissection, but opportunity should be taken to feel the staff in the urethra at this point, since it is where that tube would be opened, on the left side, m the operation of lateral lithotomy, or in the middle line m the median operation. „ , The Pudic Artery (Fig. 91, 9) will be found under cover of the pubic arch. It ascends behind the triangular ligament, and, alter giving off the artery to the bulb and the artery to the corpus caver- nosum, ends in the dorsal artery of the penis. The Artery to the Bulb (Fig. 89, 7) is a good-sized branch, which is generally above the level of the compressor urethra muscle It passes transversely inwards to supply the bulb, to reach which it has to pierce the triangular ligament close to the middle line. It gene- rally gives a branch to the Cowper's gland of the same side. The size and position of the artery to the bulb vary considerably, and are of importance with reference to lateral lithotomy. When the origin is as high as represented in Fig. 89 the artery must be free from danger, but if it should arise lower (and it is occasionally found in the ischiorectal fossa), it would be liable to be cut, when from its size it might give rise to troublesome and even ^eemorrhage The Artery to the Corpus Cavernosum (Fig. 91, 14) MB small branch which enters that vascular body and ramifies in 1UTh?Dorsal Artery of the Penis is the termination of the internal pudic.

When the pudic artery is small, the dorsal arteries are derived from the trunks of the internal iliacs, and reach the penis by piercing the triangular ligament on each side of the dorsal vein. The Dorsal Vein of the penis will afterwards be seen piercing the pelvic fascia to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The Veins corresponding to the other branches of the pudic artery take the same course as their arteries, and open into the pudic vein.

It takes the same course as the artery, and ends in the dorsal nerve of the penis, which will be afterwards dissected. [The flaps of skin should be carefully sewed together before the body is moved from its position.] Anterior Space in the Female. TA little cotton-wool is to be inserted in the vagina, and the margins of the labia majora are to be fastened together by a tew stitches. An incision is then to be carried transversely above the iunction of the labia, from which two vertical incisions, as near the maro-in of each labium as convenient, are to be prolonged to the central point of the perinamm. The flaps of skm can now be re- flected from the middle line, supposing the transverse incision behind the labia to have been already made.] The Superficial Fascia of the anterior half of the female perinamm resembles that of the male, in being divisible into two layers-super- ficial and deep. . The superficial layer of superficial fascia is continuous with the fascia of the body generally, and usually contains much fat, forming the labium. , The deep layer of superficial fascia is not so strongly marked as m the male, but has the same connections. It is continuous with the deep fascia of the groin, and is attached on each side to the iiont ot the rami of the pubes and ischium, nearly to the tuberosity. It then makes a turn around the transversa perinaa muscle on each side, and loins the deep perineal fascia or triangular ligament v. p. 1M. Owing to the position of the vulva, the deep layer of superficial fascia is divided in the middle line and becomes continuous with the sheath of the vagina ; and thus also the pouch between the deep laver of superficial fascia and the triangular ligament (p. 1/2) is divided in the female into two parts, which have been named pudendal or mlvo-scrotal sacs of Broca. TThe deep layer of superficial fascia is to be removed, and the superficial perineal vessels and nerves dissected out.J The Superficial Perinseal Artery (artery of the lab*™)<*k 92, 5) is larger than in the male.

The internal or anterior (13) nerve runs upwards and inwards, entering the pouch of fascia and being distributed to the posterior part of the vulva. The external or posterior (14) nerve is larger, and is distributed over the superficial muscles of the perinseum, forming a junction with the inferior pudendal nerve of Soemmering. The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Soemmering) (Fig. 92, 16) is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, which pierces the deep fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of the ischium. It is usually of small size in the female, and runs upwards and inwards to join the external superficial perinseal nerve. ["The superficial vessels and nerves are to be turned aside and the muscles dissected out. The muscles are much less distinct than m the male perinEeum, and it is impossible to trace all their fibres without maceration and preparation, which it is impracticable tor the student to undertake ; he will be able to make out sufficient however to assist materially in following the description.] The Perinseal Body of Savage (Fig. 93, 14) is a structure peculiar to women, consisting of a mass of elastic tissue placed between the orifices of the vagina and rectum, and uniting all the tissues which meet in the central point of the perinseum. Its use appears to be to allow of great stretching, without tearing, during parturition. The Superficial Muscles (Figs. 92 and 93) of the female peri- nEeum closely resemble those of the male, with the exception that the two portions of the central muscle (corresponding to the accele- rator urinaO are separated by the vulva. On each side therefore of the vulva will be found the bulbo-cavernosus ; lying on the ramus of the pubes, the erector clitoridis ; and, passing from the tuber ischn to the central point of the perinamm, the transversa permaBi. The Bulbo-Cavernosus (sphincter vaginas) (Fig. 93, 5) arises from the elastic perinatal body between the anus and vagina, two or three of its superficial fibres being prolonged into the sphincter am ; also from the reflection of the deep layer of superficial fascia (isclno- perinaaal ligament of Savage) for nearly an inch, and decussating with the inner fibres of the transversa. The fibres of the muscle are divisible into three sets, corresponding to those of the accelerator urinaj of the male. The anterior fibres pass forward on each side ot the vulva to meet those of the opposite muscle upon the clitoris and to be partially inserted into the sheath of the clitoris ; the middle fibres pass beneath the clitoris and over the great vems upon tne183 SUPERFICIAL PERINEAL MUSCLES. urethra, which are analogous to the corpus spongiosum of the male, meeting those of the opposite side; the posterior fibres pass on to the triangular ligament (Savage). The Erector Clitoridis (Fig. 93, 3) resembles the erector penis in the male, and though actually smaller in size, bears a much larger Fig. 93. proportion to its organ than that muscle. It arises from the front ot the tuber ischii, and is inserted on the sides of the crus clitoridis. The Transversus Perinsei (Fig. 93, 7) arises from the inner Fig. 93.—The superficial muscles 1.

The Levator Ani (Fig. 93, n) is divided by Savage into three parts • 1. The pubo-coccygeus is now seen in part, its fibres having the same direction as the sphincter ani. It wises from the back of the pubes, and its fibres encircle the rectum between the superficial and deep sphincters, and are inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 2. The obturato-coccygeus arises from the ilio- pubic line of division of the pelvic fascia into obturator and recto- vesical layers (white-line), and is inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 3. The ischio-coccygens corresponds to the coccygeus muscle as ordinarily described, and extends from the spine of the ischium to the side of the coccyx. ["The bulbo-cavernosus muscle is to be divided at its origin and turned up being dissected from the bulb of the vagina beneath and from the triangular ligament. The transversa pennsei is to be removed, and the erector clitoridis detached from the bone with the cms clitoridis, which will be seen to be a vascular body attached to the ramus of the pubes for half an inch. This is to be drawn forward, a branch of artery going to it being preserved, and the triangular ligament will be exposed.] The Bulb of the Vagina (Fig. 93, 8) (bulbus vestibuli of Kobelt) corresponds precisely to one half of the bulb of the male. It is a vascular body placed on the side of the orifice of the vagina, and enclosed in a sheath of fascia derived from the triangular ligament or deep perineal fascia. Each bulb is about an inch long, and is composed of a plexus of veins, which communicate with the great veins of the clitoris. The Triangular Ligament (Fig. 93) or Deep Perineal fascia resembles that of the male, and is a strong process of fibrous tissue stretching across the pubic arch, being attached to the rami of the pubes and ischium on each side behind the crura clitoridis It is perforated by the urethra and by the vagina, with the coats of which it is firmly incorporated; it gives passage also to the terminal branches of the pudic arteries and nerves, as in the male, and to the large veins of the clitoris and bulbs which pass to the plexus on the neck of the bladder. [The triangular ligament is to be carefully detached from the bone anu removed, when the deep muscles and the terminal branches ot the pudic artery and nerve are to be dissected.]THE ABDOMINAL WALL. 185 The Deep Muscles are the Deep Transverse, and the Constrictor of the Vagina. The Deep. Transverse Muscle arises from the ramus of the ischium and passes to the central point of the perinceum, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side. The Constrictor of the Vagina consists of a few fibres which arise from the central point of the perinseum, and ascend to meet the muscle of the opposite side over the urethra. Involuntary circular fibres surround the whole length of the female urethra. The Glands of Bartholin (Fig. 93, 12) correspond to Cowper's glancls in the male. Each gland is of the size of a small bean, and is situated behind the triangular ligament opposite the lower border of the bulb. The minute duct of each gland opens on the mucous surface of the vagina, about half an inch from the orifice and in front of the hymen. Pudic Artery and Nerve (Fig. 92). The terminations of the pudic artery and nerve in the female correspond closely to those of the male, but are much smaller. The artery lies under cover of the ramus of the pubes with the nerve, and gives off an artery to the bulb, to the crus clitoridis, and the dorsal artery of the clitoris. The artery of the bulb (8) runs transversely inwards, and terminates in the bulb of the vagina. The artery to the crus clitoridis (9) is very small, and is lost in that organ. The dorsal artery of the clitoris (7) reaches the dorsum of the organ with the corresponding nerve. The Dorsal Vein of the clitoris is of large size, and passes backwards to open into the great veins around the neck of the bladder. The Pudic Nerve (11) gives off muscular branches (12), and ends in the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (18), which bears a much larger proportion to that organ than the corresponding nerve of the penis. [The flaps of skin should be carefully fastened together with stitches before the body is moved from its position.] Dissection of the Abdominal Wall. The dissection of the Perinaeum having been completed the student should proceed to examine the abdominal wall, the condition of which wiU vary considerably in different subjects. In a fat subiect the wall of the abdomen will be smooth and uniform, but in a thinTHE ABDOMINAL WALL. 186 muscular subject the prominences of the muscles will be readily recognised. In all bodies, the umbilicus will be seen in the median line about midway between the pubes and the ensiform cartilage of the sternum, and it should be noted whether there is any protrusion at this point, constituting an exomphalos or umbilical hernia. The median line will be found to be slightly depressed, corresponding, as will be afterwards seen, to the linea alba, and it is here, below the umbilicus, that the operation of paracentesis or tapping the abdomen is performed. On each side of the median line and parallel to it, is the promi- nence caused by the rectus abdominis muscle, and occasionaUy the markings in that muscle known as the linece transversa can be seen through the skin. Immediately above the pubes and close to the median line is occasionally seen the prominence of the pyramidalis muscle on each side. The pubic bone will be recognised with the fmaer, which should be carried outwards to the spine of the pubes, to which Poupart's ligament is attached. The ligament when traced 'out will be followed along the fold of the groin to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, from which the iliac crest passes backwards. On the sides of the lower part of the thorax, the interdigitations of the obliquus externus with the serratus magnus may be seen through, the skin, in a well developed subject The condition of the abdominal rings and inguinal canal should be carefully examined before the skin is removed. If the spermatic cord be traced up from the testis, it may be felt to disappear through an opening known as the external abdominal ring, and even in a per- fectly well-formed subject the fore-finger can be passed into the ring with tolerable facility, if pushed up from below, carrying the scrotum before it In a subject with a tendency to hernia, the finger can be carried along the inguinal canal to the internal abdominal ring, or if . a rupture actually exists, may be passed into the abdominal cavity, Linns before it the loose skin. If any tumour of the^ scrotum should happen to be present, it should be carefully examined and its natm-e diagnosed, with a view to confirmation by subsequent ^he1 female, the abdominal ring is usually of small s^e and generally too contracted to admit the finger, but may be I hernia. The projection above the pubes which is covered^ hair and Snown as the mons Veneris, is due simply to a of fat in the superficial fascia at this point. The skin of ^d^n of women who have borne children is marked by numerous small white scars, the result of its over-distension during pregnancy.CUTANEOUS NERVES OF ABDOMEN. 187 Percussion and palpation should be carefully practised, in order to make out the limits of the principal organs of the abdomen before the dissection is *begun, and the student is referred to Fig. 106, on which the position of the several viscera is shown in health, but from which considerable variations may be expected. The presence of fluid in the peritoneal cavity may be ascertained by the production of fluctuation, between the hands applied on opposite sides of the abdomen. [In order to dissect the abdominal wall, it is necessary to distend the abdomen fully with air. To do this, a narrow knife should be thrust through the umbilicus into the peritoneal cavity, and a blowpipe be inserted. A circular incision is then to be made through the skin round the umbilicus, and a piece of whipcord tied round the blow- pipe and in the groove cut in the skin. When the abdomen has been fully distended, the blowpipe is to be withdrawn, and the opening carefully secured. One incision is to be carried from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes (avoiding the umbilicus), and another at right angles to it along the crest of the ilium and from the anterior superior spine of the ilium horizontally to the middle line. A third at the level of the ensiform cartilage is to reach well back to the loins. The skin is then to be reflected from the median line by these incisions.] The Superficial Fascia in this region resembles that throughout the body, but is sometimes much loaded with fat; it is to be re- flected by the same incisions as the skin, and in doing this there will be found in it the terminations of the cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 94) consist of two sets, anterior and lateral. The anterior nerves, which are Very small, will be found in two rows, one close to the linea alba, and the other piercing the tendon of the external oblique two inches from the median line ; the lateral branches will be found of greater length, running along the fibres of the same muscle and also giving a few small twigs back- wards. Both sets are derived from the dorsal spinal nerves. About two inches behind the anterior spine of the ilium and half an inch above the crest, will be found the lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve, and close upon the crest of the bone a little pos- terior to the preceding nerve will be seen the iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve (1st lumbar), both of them going to the buttock (13). Accompanying the nerves will be found (in a well-injected body only) small branches of arteries derived from the intercostal, internal mammary, and epigastric arteries.THE ABDOMINAL WALL. 188 [The external oblique muscle is to n4 fton, below on the ^X^iSS. taking care not to remove Fig. 94.

The interdigitations with the serratus magnus and latissimus dorsi are to be carefully defined.] The Obliquus Exteruus (Fig. 1, 12) has its origin from the outer surfaces of the eight lower ribs, and thus interdigitates above with the serratus magnus by five points, and with the latissimus dorsi below by three points. Its fibres pass obliquely downwards and forwards towards the middle line, except the posterior ones, which pass vertically to the crest of the ilium. [In order to see the whole of the insertion of this muscle it will be necessary to continue the dissection by reflecting the triangle of skin left upon the groin.] The Superficial Fascia of the Groin (Fig. 95) differs from that over the abdomen in being divisible into two layers—superficial and deep. The superficial layer of superficial fascia (a) resembles that found elsewhere, but the deep layer (b) (Scarpa's fascia) is more mem- branous. It is directly continuous with the deep layer of the super- ficial fascia in the perinseum (p. 172), and is attached firmly to the fascia lata of the thigh a little below Poupart's ligament, thus pre- venting any urine which may have been infiltrated into the tissues from passing down the thigh. Superficial Vessels and Nerves (Fig. 95).—Between the layers of superficial fascia, will be found three small branches of the femoral artery with their accompanying veins. The superficial circumflex iliac (d) runs outwards about the level of Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior spine ; the superficial epigastric (e) runs upwards for a short distance on the abdominal wall; and the superior external pudic (/) runs over the spermatic cord to the scrotum. The veins corresponding to these arteries join the saphenous vein as it opens into the femoral. Upon, or a little below, Poupart's ligament will be found two or three glands, which receive the lymphatics from the penis and scrotum. The tendon of the obliquus externus being exposed, a nerve will be found piercing it about two inches above the pubes—the ilio- hypogastric from the 1st lumbar; and another maybe traced upon the spermatic cord—the ilio-inguinal (?i) also from the 1st lumbar (Fig. 94). 13.

In addition to these larger insertions there are two small ones which cannot be defined in the present stage, viz., into the ilio-pectineal line (forming Gimbernat's ligament) and into the crest of the pubes of the opposite side, forming the triangular fascia. Immediately above the pubes, the spermatic cord (or the round ligament of the uterus in the female) will be seen to emerge from the tendon, the opening being obscured by the intercolumnar or external spermatic fascia, which must be removed to expose the abdominal ring. The External Abdominal Ring (Fig. 95, i) is merely a slit in the external oblique tendon, placed obliquely immediately above and to the outer side of the spine of the pubes. In the healthy subject it is triangular with the base downwards and inwards, being about an inch in length and half an inch across, and its boundaries have been named the pillars or columns of the ring. It will be observed that the outer pillar is triangular at the upper part, but becomes round and thick below, and corresponds to Poupart's ligament; whilst the internal pillar is flat, and is continuous with the rest of the tendon. At the upper part of the ring may be seen some curved fibres running in a transverse direction and called the intercolumnar fibres, the con^ tinuation of which formed the intercolumnar or external spermatic fascia. It should be noticed that the spermatic cord does not lie in the centre of the ring, but upon the outer pillar or Poupart's ligament, which is slightly drawn down by the weight of the testis. [The external oblique is to be reflected by cutting, both verticallv and horizontally, through its muscular fibres where thev ioin the tendon, and by detaching them from the ribs immediately below their origin The greater part of the muscle can then be turned back towards the lorn, and the corresponding tendon may be dis- sected up as far as possible towards the median line. The handle of the kmfe should be passed under the triangular portion of tendon left m the groin parallel to and as near the median line as possible alter which the tendon may be readily divided by a vertical incision' and reflected towards the thigh without endangering the subjacent parts. When to is done, it will be found W the tendinous fibres of one side decussate or interlace with those of the other immediately above the pubes, and cross to the opposite side of the median line, where they become attached to the spine and crest of the pubes and sometimes as far as the ilio-pectineal line thu£ lorming the triangular fascia* The internal oblique muscle will * tissue, which can be defined in well-developed subjects cmW ?a i ^ named triangular fascia than triangular ligament, which iS £7' V betjei; with the deep fascia of the perinteum.

The origin is from the anterior two-thirds of the middle of the crest of the ilium; from the outer half of Poupart's liga- ment ; and slightly from the fascia lumborum. The upper fibres pass to be inserted into the cartilages of the last four ribs, and into the linea alba by an aponeurosis, which is split to enclose the rectus and form its sheath, as will be afterwards seen; while the lower fibres, becoming gradually more and more horizontal in their course to the middle line, in the end arch downwards to help to form the conjoined tendon, and to be inserted into the crest of the pubes and the ilio-pectineal line. In the male subject, some pale muscular fibres will be found to be continuous with the lower border of the internal oblique, and to overlie the spermatic cord, forming the cremaster muscle. The Cremaster (Fig. 100, h), consists of a series of thin muscular loops spread over the spermatic cord. It is attached externally to the inner end of Poupart's ligament, where it is continuous wlth the internal oblique, and internally to the spine and crest of the> pubes In addition to the loops, there are a few muscular fibres on each side of the spermatic cord connected with the cremasteric fascia. IJie cremaster is supplied by the genital branch ofthe^nito^crm-al nerve. Figs. 96, 97, 98,-Diagrams to illustrate the descent of the testis and the forma- tion of the tunica vaginalis (drawn by J. T. Gray).THE CREMASTER. 193 To explain the formation of this muscle it will be necessary to refer to the early stage of fcetal life, when the testis was situated within the abdomen and immediately below the kidney. About the seventh mouth of fcetal life the testis passes through the internal abdominal ring, and by the eighth month reaches the scrotum, a process of peritoneum (processus vaginalis) prece,ding it, and being connected with the testis by the plica gubematrix. The looped fibres of the cremaster would appear to be fibres of the internal oblique drawn clown by the testicle in its descent. According to Curling, a muscular band, consisting of three sets of fibres and called the gubemaculum testis, passed from the pubes to the testis, and its divisions had the following attachments—one to the bottom of the scrotum, and one, on each side of the external abdominal ring, to Poupart's ligament and the crest of the pubes (Fig. 96). By the action of these bands the testicle was drawn down as far as the external abdominal ring, but it is obvious that when it had reached this point the lateral bands must have become horizontal, and thus have lost all power of traction ; and the further progress of the testis depended therefore upon the middle band which continued to draw the gland to the bottom of the scrotum (Fig. 97). The effect of this was to stretch the lateral bands attached to the pubes on each side, and thus they formed more or less Fig. 97. Fig. 98. o194 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. Tig. 99.

At this stage they may be seen giving off their lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the obliquus interims at once. Close above the crista ilii may be found the branches of the first lumbar nerve (16) (ilio-hypo- gastric and iHo-mguinal) running downwards to the pubes.

Its insertion is into the middle line from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes, being insep- arably united with the internal oblique ; and into the ilio-pectineal line, forming with the internal oblique the conjoined tendon. Anatomy of Inguinal Hernia. This will be the best time for examining the parts concerned in inguinal hernia, winch is the protrusion of some part of the abdominal contents through certain openings in the region of the groin. To do this, the muscles shoidd be restored as nearly as possible to their natural positions, and the student will then see again the opening in the tendon of the external oblique called the external abdominal ring. Through this opening (the intercolumnar fascia having been previously removed) the spermatic cord with its vessels will be seen to pass, and on tracing it up by turning the muscles aside in their order, it will be found to disappear beneath the sharp arched border of the transversalis muscle. The tissue into which it disappears is the fascia transversalis, lining the abdomen externally to the peritoneum, and with a little care a hole may be artificially made in this fascia and around the cord, to which the name of internal abdominal ring is given. The opening of the in- ternal ring is necessarily artificial, because the fascia transversalis was prolonged upon the " cord when the testis was drawn out of the abdomen, and thus took the shape of a funnel, being hence called the infundibular fascia* (Fig. 100, i.) The Internal AbdoniinalRing (Fig. 101) is an opening in the fascia transversa^, placed midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and about half an inch above ve°S ^ immecHate1^ external to the deep epigastric ■ The Inguinal Canal (Fig. 100) is the space between the external and internal abdominal rings, an inch and a half in length and i, occupied by the spermatic cord.

The coverings of each hernia will be best seen by tracing them from within outwards ■ thus oblique hernia would have (1) peri- toneal sac ; (2) in coining through the internal ring it would have the fascia transversalis, or infundibular fascia ; (3) in passing beneath the internal oblique it would have the cremaster muscle, the fibres of which are muted by cellular tissue and are sometimes known as the cremasteric fascia ; in emerging from the external ring it would have (4) the mtercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial iascia and skin. Direct hernia would have, (1) the peritoneum, and (2) the fascia transversalis, (for both line the abdomen) ; then pushing into the inguinal canal it would have a covering (3) from the conjoined tendon ; and lastly emerging from the external ring, it would have (4) the mtercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial Fig. lOl.-Diagram of the inguinal canal, showing its anterior and ™ * • boundaries (drawn by J.

Bv dividing the fascia transversalis about half an inch to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, there will be found an artery called the deep epigastric, lying between the two rings and mnmng in a line from the middle of Poupart's ligament to the umbilicus, and the varieties of inguinal hernia have been named external or internal according to their relation to this vessel. It is obvious that a hernia passing through the internal ring must be external to this artery, and hence oblique hernia and external hernia the same way, direct hernia protrudes.through the abdommal jail.to the inner side of the epigastric artery, and thus internal is the same as direct hernia.

By a natuial processVAEIETIES OF INGUINAL HEKNIA. 199 occurring during the later months of foetal life, an obliteration of the portion of tube within the canal takes place, and thus a small sac is formed around the testis which is called the tunica vaginalis^ while a mere dimple is left in the peritoneum at the internal ring. Thus, when in the ordinary condition of the parts a hernia descends, its sac is above and quite distinct from the tunica vaginalis (Fig. 102). Occasionally, however, this obliteration does not take place, and the tunica vaginalis remains continuous with the peritoneum. In Tig. 102. Fig. 103. Fie?. 104. o that case the hernia descends at once into the tunica vaginalis and lies over the testis, and being the consequence of a congenital defect it is termed congenital hernia (Fig. 103). In what is termed congenital hydrocele the anatomical arrange- ment is the same, and the fluid runs from the peritoneal cavity into the scrotum and back again, according to the position of the patient. Infantile or encysted hernia exists when only a partial obliteration of the peritoneal tube has taken place, and the tunica vaginalis is left larger than usual and prolonged into the inguinal canal to a slight extent. Thus, when a hernia descends, it pushes down behind this portion of the tunica vaginalis, and there are therefore three layers of serous membrane in front of that covering the intestine, two Fig. 102.—Diagram of a common scrotal hernia, showing the relation of the sac to the tunica vaginalis testis (J.

An mcision is made over the external ring, and the surgeon dissects carefully down through the several layers (which are never distinctly separable in practice) until he reaches the peritoneal sac, which is recognised by its bluish appearance. Passing the forefinger carefuUy around this he feels for the stricture, which may possibly be at the external ring (where it is easily divided), or more probably within the inguinal canal. Having discovered the stricture, he next passes the hernia- knife along the finger, and, using it or a director as a guide, insinuates t^e knife, held rial* beneath the stricture, and divides it by bringing the edge of the knife upwards and pressing it against the tissues with thThe§direction in which the superficial incision is made is of little consequence, but in the deep incision the rule is to cut oirectly upwards, so as to be parallel to the epigastric artery; for once a in the diagnosis between an external and an interna henna Tav occur owing to the parts becoming distorted and the abdomina Igs ZwnToge°ther in old-standing hernhe, it is well to be careful lest the artery should be divided.

The Spermatic Cord may now be examined, and will be found to consist of the vas deferens or duct of the testicle, together with the spermatic artery and veins, bound together with loose areolar tissue and covered more or less by the cremaster muscle. In a well-injected subject a small branch may be traced from the epigastric artery to the cord, which is the cremasteric artery ; and the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve may be found in the cremaster muscle, which it supplies. The position of the vas deferens at the back of the cord should be noticed, and may always be recognised by its feeling like a piece of whipcord. Upon the vas may be found a small branch of the vesical artery—the deferential artery. Tunica Vaginalis Testis (Fig. 102).—By drawing the testicle out of the scrotum and making an incision over the anterior part of it, the tunica vaginalis will be opened, and will be seen to consist of two parts, the tunica vaginalis propria upon the testis, and the reflexa or part around. The tunica vaginalis propria converts the subjacent tunica albuginea into a fibro-serous membrane, the other examples of which are the pericardium and the dura-mater. The Penis should now be examined, and the student may advantageously practise the operation of circumcision. It should be noticed that the skin becomes continuous with the mucous membrane at the margin of the fore-skin or prepuce, which is lined by the membrane continued from the glans penis. Below the orifice of the urethra will be foimcl the fold called the frcenum prozputii, and around the base of the glans penis is a circular ridge, the corona glandis, upon which open a number of sebaceous glands, the glandules odoriferce, that secrete the smegma prceputii. An incision is to be carried along the upper surface of the penis, when there will be found the dorsal vein with the dorsal artery and nerve on each side of it, the nerve being most external. The artery and nerve are the terminations of the pudic artery and nerve, and the vein passes through the triangular ligament to open into the prostatic plexus. The Suspensory Ligament of the penis is a triangular piece of strong fibrous tissue, attached to the front of the symphysis pubis and to the upper surface of the penis, where it is divided into two layers to give passage to the dorsal vessels and nerves. [Returning to the abdominal wall the dissector will find the rectus muscle close to the median line and still enclosed in its sheath through which it is indistinctly visible. The line between the recti is known as the hnea alba, that at the outer border of each202 INGUINAL HERNIA.. muscle as the linca semilunaris, and the transverse markings, three or four in number, are the linece transversa.] The Sheath of the Rectus (Fig. 108) having been opened by a vertical incision, will be found to be formed by the tendon of the internal oblique, which splits at the linea semilunaris to enclose it. Thin in front of the muscle there is the tendon of the obliquus externus and one-half of the tendon of the obliquus internals, whilst behind is the other half of the tendon of the obliquus mternus and the tendon of the transversalis. This arrangement does not hold aood throughout, for upon lifting up the lower part of the rectus it will be found that a little below the umbilicus (seldom so low as midway between the umbilicus and pubes) the sheath is wanting behind, i.e. it passes entirely in front, and there is nothing between the muscle and the peritoneum but the fascia transversalis. The point where the sheath ceases to pass behind the rectos is marked by a sharp curved margin (fold of Douglas), over which the epigastric vessels will be seen to pass, and which will be after- wards seen from behind (Fig. 105, c). Tin many subjects immediately above the pubes, in front of the X ^enclosed in its sheath, will be found a little muscular slip, the pyramidalis. Both muscles are to be cleaned in the direction of their fibres.] The Pyramidalis (Fig. 94) arises from the crest of the pubes close to the median line, and passes up for about two inches to be inserted into the linea alba. The Rectus Abdominis (Fig. 94, 5) arises by two heads, one from the crest and the other from the symphysis pubis It expands into a broad thin muscle, and is inserted into the ensiiorm cartilage and into the cartilages of the last three true ribs (5th, 6th, and 7th). The lineas transversa are tendinous intersections corresponding to abdominal ribs ; one is placed nearly opposite the umbilicus, a second at the level of the ensiiorm cartilage, and a third between them. A fourth is occasionally found between the umbilicus and ^The Epigastric Artery (Fig. 100) is to be traced into the rectus muscle, which it will be found to enter at the part wheretafr is deficient, passing over the fold of Douglas The muscle should be divided and carefully dissected off the ^.T^^g be traced up to the sternum, where it anastomoses with the internal mammary artery. This is a most important anastomosis, forniing a direct comnmnication between the subclavian and the external203 FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. iliac arteries, which, comes into play after ligature of the external or common iliacs, or ohstruction of me descending aorta. The nerves piercing the rectus are the terminations of the lower intercostal nerves, which pass through it and the sheath to reach the skin (Fig. 94). The Eascia Transversalis is the membrane lining the trans- versalis muscle, and is continuous with the fascia iliaca covering the iliacus muscle. It varies in appearance, being usually thin and transparent, but in fat subjects becoming thickened and united with the sub-peritoneal layer of adipose tissue. Midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament in the fascia transversalis, is the internal abdominal ring, through which the spermatic cord of the male and round ligament of the female reach the groin, receiving in their passage a covering from the fascia transversalis (infundi- bular fascia). Beneath the middle of Poupart's ligament the fascia transversalis passes upon the external iliac vessels to join the iliac fascia in forming the sheath of the femoral vessels (p. 87), and a few thickened fibres lying beneath Poupart's ligament form the deep crural arch. Action of the Abdominal Muscles.—The abdominal muscles compress the viscera when put in action, and thus act as muscles of expiration, and in direct opposition to the diaphragm. The attach- ment of the muscles to the lower ribs enables them at the same time to depress the wall of the thorax, thus assisting the internal inter- costal muscles. The abdominal muscles are called into play chiefly in violent expiratory efforts, such as coughing, sneezing, etc., and have a most important action upon the viscera during the acts of micturition, defecation, vomiting, and parturition. The rectus abdominis has the power of approximating the pelvis and thorax, as seen in rising from the supine position without the aid of the hands, or in climbing. When spasmodically contracted in tetanus, it pro- duces the bowed condition of the trunk known as emprosthotonos. The abdominal muscles are supplied by the lower six intercostal nerves, and by the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first lumbar nerve (Fig. 94). The abdominal wall having been finished on both sides, the dissectors should cut through the remains of the abdominal muscles in two or three places until the peritoneum is exposed, but without injuring the latter, in order to study the appearance of the mem- brane which forms the sac of a hernia. They should then open the abdomen and dissect the viscera together1.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 204 Cavity of the Abdomen.

The central cord is the obliterated urachus (m), those on each side of -it are the obliterated hypogastric arteries (i), and the outside ones are the two epigastric arteries (b) seen through the wall. The peritoneum is raised into distinct folds by the obliterated hypogastric arteries, and external to the epigastric artery on each side may be seen a small dimple in the membrane, marking the position of the internal abdominal rings. The term " Hesselbach's triangle" {cl) has been applied to the tri- angular space bounded by the border of the rectus internally, the epigastric artery externally, and Poupart's ligament below, and it is through this that direct inguinal hernia forces its way. The fold of Douglas (c), or sharp lower margin of the posterior sheath of the rectus, will be readily perceived through the peritoneum. [By dividing the lower portion of the abdominal wall in the median line, it can be reflected on each side, and the abdominal contents will be exposed.] Abdominal Cavity (Fig. 106).—The parts first seen on opening the abdomen are the stomach and right lobe of the liver, with a small portion of the left lobe and the gall-bladder if distended, whilst the great omentum passing clown from the stomach conceals the rest of the intestines. Should, however, the great omentum be turned up, as often happens, the mass of the small intestines will be visible, and immediately below the stomach the transverse colon. The ascending and descending colon will be more or less visible on each side, according to the amount of their distension. A very much distended bladder, or the pregnant uterus, would be visible at once, a^i the amount of liver and stomach which will appear will depencKlpon the healthy condition of those organs, and upon their not having been displaced by tight-lacing. For convenience of description the abdomen is divided into the following regions, by imaginary lines passing vertically from the seventh costal cartilage to the middle of Poupart's ligament on each side ; and horizontally, at the level of the ninth costal cartilages and the spines of the ilium, respectively. In the centre are the epigastric umbilical, and hypogastric regions ; and at each side the^hypo- chondriac, lumbar, and iliac or inguinal regions. The position of the several viscera should now be noted and the different organs identified.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 200 Fig. 106. Regions of the Abdomen. Eight Hypochondriac. Epigastric.

Tracing the stomach to the right side it will be found to terminate in the small intestine (duodenum), and the point of demarcation between the organs is marked by a thickened band of fibres, the pylorus. The duodenum can be traced for a short distance only at present. By drawing up the great omentum the transverse colon will be exposed crossing the umbilical region, and continuous on the right side with the ascending colon, and on the left with the descending colon, which should be traced out. Occupying the hypogastric region are the coils of the small intestine, two-fifths of which constitute the jejunum, and the remainder the ileum ; this may be seen to end in the large intestine in the right iliac fossa, where the commencement of the colon (caput ccecum coli, or csecum) will be recognised by its little appendage, the appendix vermiformis. In the left iliac region will be seen the tortuous portion of the large intestine, called°the sigmoid flexure, which may be traced to its termination in the rectum at the brim of the true pelvis.

It will be well for the student to notice the distinctive appearances of the several parts of the intestinal canal, and particularly the differences hetween the large and small intestines.

This will be found by passing the finger carefully round the right border of the lesser omentum, immediately below the liver when its point maybe seen through the semitransparent double fold 'of the lesser omentum. To see the cavity of the lesser bag, an incision must be carefully made through the double anterior layer of the great omentum, when, if the parts are healthy, the bag will be readily opened and the finger passed through the foramen of Winslow will be clearly seen. Tracing it from the foramen, the membrane of the lesser bag will he found to form the posterior layer of the lesser omentum then to cover the posterior surface of the stomach, and to be prolonged down- wards to form the two internal layers of the great omentum ; after which it covers the upper part of the transverse colon and forms the unuer haver of the transverse meso-colon. It then passes up over the pancreas to the under surface of the liver behind the transverse fissure.

They then separate fo enclose the stomach, uniting at its lower border to form the anterior two layers of the great omentum; being reflected upon themsles they next form the posterior two layers, which separate toTnctse the transverse colon, forming the transverse meso-colon as they are prolonged to the spine.

A fold attaching the top of the descending colon to the under surface of the diaphragm (costo-colic, Jenner) should be noticed, since it passes below the spleen and influences the movements of that organ. Fig. 108. Above the colon the arrangement is a little complicated by the existence of the two sacs, the continuity of which however may thus be traced (Fig. 108). Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be traced into the right hypochondrium and over the right kidney ; it then passes through the loop of the hepatic artery (foramen Winslowii), and across the body in front of the pancreas, then to the posterior surface of the stomach and back to the foramen again, where it forms the posterior layer of the lesser omentum. Keflected at this point upon itself, the membrane will be seen to form the anterior layer of the lesser omentum and to be con- Fig. 108 —Transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of YVmslow (drawn by J.

The doubled edges of the upper layer of the coronary ligament on each side are called the right and left lateral ligaments. The false ligaments of the Bladder are formed by the peritoneum ; they are five in number, two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior false ligaments are the margins of the recto-vesical pouch, and are formed by the membrane being reflected over the obliterated hypogastric arteries. The lateral false ligaments are the pieces of peritoneum reaching from the bladder to the sides of the pelvis, and the superior is that passing over the obliterated hypogas- tric arteries and urachus to the umbilicus. In the female (Fig. 109), the pelvis is divided transversely by a fold of peritoneum reaching from each side of the uterus to the side of the pelvis, and called the broad ligament of the uterus ; in which will be found the ovary, the Fallopian tube, and the round ligament. It is by the open mouth of the Fallopian tube that the peritoneum has a communication with the mucous membrane of the uterus. The Uterus and Vagina intervene between the rectum and bladder of the female, and the peritoneum is prolonged from the rectum to the posterior wall of the vagina, and then over the uterus to the bladder, thus forming the recto-vaginal and utero-vesical pouches, the margins of which are the anterior and posterior ligaments of the uterus. In the child an arrangement may occasionally be found which is extremely rare in the adult—the posterior layer of the great omentum ascending directly to the pancreas, and then being again reflected to the colon to form its meso-colon. 4 Mesenteric Vessels. [In order to dissect the mesenteric arteries, the great omentum and transverse colon must be turned up over the cartilages of the ribs, and the small intestines be drawn down. Beginning at the upper end of the jejunum (i. e., at the point where the small in- testine can first be distinctly seen), the dissector should remove the whole of the anterior layer of the mesentery as far as the edge of the bowel where it is to be cut off. This must be continued atong the whole length of the small intestine, and the mesentery will be found to pass obliquely downwards from left to right.

The Cceliac Axis. [The intestines are now to be replaced, and the liver fastened up to the ribs, either with hooks or, better, by a few stitches : the stomach being drawn down, the lesser omentum is then to be carefully- removed.] Between the layers of the lesser omentum will be found three important structures, and in the following positions (Fig. 113). To the right and most in front is the bile-duct (7), to the left the hepatic artery (5), and behind and between the two the large vena portse (9). Behind the lesser omentum in the middle line will be found the short trunk of the Cceliac Axis and its branches, viz., the gastric (coronaria ventriculi), the hepatic, and the splenic arteries. The Gastric Artery (Fig. 112, 12), the smallest of the three,, passes along the lesser curvature of the stomach from left to right, giving branches to both surfaces of that organ and to the oesophagus ; it anastomoses at the pylorus with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. Branches of the sympathetic (gastric plexus) may be traced upon it. Its accompanying vein opens into the vena portse. The opportunity may be taken to notice the distribution of the pneumo-gastric nerves to the stomach. The left pneumo-gastric gives numerous branches to the front of the stomach and the right to the back of the viscus, and these can be generally seen through the peritoneal coat without further dissection. ^ The Hepatic Artery (Fig. 112, 1) passes upwards and to the right side (thus forming the inferior and anterior, boundaries of the foramen of Winslow), and will be seen to divide into the right and left hepatic branches, which enter the transverse fissure of the liver. The artery gives off the pyloric branch (3) which has been seen to anastomose with the gastric, and a trunk which immediately disappears behind the duodenum and is called the gastro-duodenal (13). From the right hepatic branch the small cystic (7) artery is given off, which is distributed to the gall-bladder by two branches, one passing between it and the liver and the other along its free surface. The Splenic Artery (Fig. 112, 20) can now be seen only in part, taking a tortuous course behind the stomach and along the upper border of the pancreas to the spleen. [To continue the dissection it will be necessary to remove the intestines which have been examined, by putting a couple of ligatures upon the upper part of the jejunum, and also upon the218 THE CCELIAC AXIS. upper part of the rectum, and dividing the intestine between the two ligatures at each point.

After passing behind the duodenum it divides into the right gastro-epiploic and the superior pancreatico- duodenal arteries. The Gastro-epiploica dextra (23) runs from right to left along the great curvature of the stomach and between the folds of the great omentum; it anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica sinistra of the splenic artery. The Pancreatico-duodenalis superior (17) will be found between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, the latter of which it sur- rounds ; it anastomoses with the small branch from the commence- ment of the superior mesenteric artery called the pancreatico-duode- nalis inferior (Fig. 110, 13), and gives branches to both pancreas and duodenum. The Splenic Artery (Fig. 112, 20) can now be seen in the whole of its course to the spleen, near which it breaks up into four or five branches which enter the hilum or fissure on the concave surface of that organ. As it passes along the upper border of the pancreas it gives off small branches to it {pancreaticoz parvai), and one (pancreatica magna) which runs along the whole length of the gland with the duct. It also gives small branches (vasa brevia) (14) to the great end of the stomach, and one large one (gastro-epiploica sinistra) (18), which runs along the great curvature to anastomose with the gastro-epiploica dextra of the hepatic. Upon the hepatic and splenic arteries are corre- sponding plexuses of the sympathetic. The Splenic Vein (Fig. 114, 3) is placed below its artery and lies behind the pancreas. It receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, and also at about the middle of the pancreas, the inferior mesenteric vein. It is joined by the superior mesen- teric vein behind the head of the pancreas, the two forming the vena portce. [The pancreas and duodenum should now be thoroughly defined, and the bile and the pancreatic ducts traced to their entrance into the intestine. If desired, the stomach may be removed by tying and cut- ting it near the pylorus, and at the oesophagus.] The Duodenum (Fig. 113, ir) is from eight to ten inches long (twelve finger-breadths), and makes a peculiar bend upon itself be- fore it passes beneath the mesenteric artery, to become the jejunum •220 THE CCELIAC AXIS. thus entering successively the right hypochondriac, the right lumbar, and the umbilical regions. The first or ascending -portion reaches from the pylorus to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, where it is in close proximity to the gall-bladder. It is covered both in front and behind by a pro- longation from the lesser omentum, and is therefore movable with the stomach. Behind it are the vena portse, the common bile duct, and the gastro-duodenal artery. The second or descending portion is covered in front by the perito- neum, which binds it to the surface of the right kidney, in front of which it descends for about three inches behind the ascending colon. It lies close to the outer side of the head of the pancreas, with the pan- creatico-duodenal arteries intervening, and into its posterior surface the biliary and pancreatic ducts open. The third or transverse portion^ fixed to the abdominal wall at the line of attachment of the meso-colon, and therefore has no proper peri- toneal covering. It is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein, and lying upon the vena cava, and upon the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm, it gradually ascends from the level of the third to that of the second lumbar vertebra, at the left side of which it becomes the jejunum. Immediately above it is the body of the pancreas with the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. This is the most fixed portion of the small intestine, and, owing to the weight of the remainder of the bowel, it is at the junction of the duodenum with the jejunum that laceration most commonly occurs in cases of abdo- minal injury. , The Pancreas (Fig. 113, 10, 13) lies transversely in the abdomen, occupying the right lumbar, epigastric, and left hypochondriac regions ; the head being embraced by the duodenum, the hody cross- ing the aorta between the coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric artery and the tail touching the spleen. It was covered by the lesser baa of the peritoneum, and from right to left it crosses the vena portse, the vena cava, and the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm; and then lies over nearly the whole length of the splenic vein, crossing the two mesenteric veins as they ascend to join it. The duct runs along the whole length of the gland to join the common bile duct, which lies in the groove between the duodenum and pancreas ; and the united ducts open very obliquely into the back of the second part of the duodenum. . .. The Bile Duct (Fig. 113, 7) should be traced up to the bvei, where it will, be found to commence in the right and left hepatic duct,, which emerge from the transverse fissure ; these unite to torm theTHE VENA PORT^. 221 common hepatic duct, which is joined at an acute angle by the duct of the gall-bladder (cystic), thus forming the common bile duct or ductus communis choledochus.

It lies against the left supra-renal capsule and the diaphragm, and the tail of the pancreas touches its lower margin. The splenic vessels will be seen to enter the hilum or slit on its concave surface. Deep Dissection of the Abdomen. [The stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and spleen should now be taken away by dividing the oesophagus, bile duct, and vessels, and the liver should then be carefully removed in order to see the arrangement of the coronary ligament. The round and falciform ligaments should first be cut and the liver pulled down ; by carrying the knife along the attachment to the diaphragm the upper layer of the coronary ligament will then be divided, as well as the lateral liga- ments on each side which are formed from it. The vena cava and a part of the liver uncovered by peritoneum will now be exposed, the latter being attached to the diaphragm by areolar tissue, and when these are carefully divided, the right supra-renal capsule and the top of the right kidney will be brought into view. The vena cava must be again cut through at the lower margin of the liver, when it will only be necessary to divide the under layer of the coronary liga- ment (derived chiefly from the lesser bag of the peritoneum) to re- move the organ. The viscera should all be placed in a covered pan for examination during the time that the subject is turned. The Diaphragm is to be cleaned by stripping off the peritoneum as far as possible m the direction of the muscular fibres • and at the same time the inner surface of the flap of abdominal muscles still attached should be cleaned, in order to follow out the fibres of the transversalis. Care must be taken not to puncture the diaphragm and to leave the branches of artery and nerve ramifying on its surface The crura or muscular slips on each side of the aorta must be caretuily cleaned, and two tendinous arches over the psoas and quadratus luniborum muscles defined, for which purpose it will be temporarily^ ^ ^ ** °V6r t0 the °PPosite side The Diaphragm (Fig. 115) is found to be arched after death being concave towards the abdomen (particularly on the right side)' owing to the fact that expiration is the last act of life, and rising to the level of the fifth costal cartilage on the right but the sixth on the left side. It arises from the back of the ensiform cartilage and from the inner surfaces of the six lower ribs, where it interdimtates with the transversalis abdominis ; also from the ligam,enta arcuata externa and interna, of which the internal one passes from the bodv to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and the exterDEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 224 nal one from the same transverse process to the last rih ; the two crossing the psoas and quadrates lumborum muscles respectively.

All the fibres of the diaphragm are inserted into the central cordi- form or trefoil tendon, but the inner fibres of the crura decussate with one another and form a figure-of-8 before they pass into the tendon, thus surrounding the aorta and oesophagus. Openings.—There are three large openings in the diaphragm, viz., the Aortic, the (Esophageal, and the Vena Caval openings, and two or three small orifices in the crura for the splanchnic nerves and vena azygos minor, and also for the vena azygos major if it does not pass through the aortic opening. The Aortic and (Esophageal openings are in the loops formed by the crura, and the front or oesophageal one, which is also to the left side, is entirely muscular; but that for the aorta will be found upon dissection to become tendinous, owing to some deep fibres which pass transversely over the vessel. The aortic opening is strictly speaking behind the diaphragm, being bounded posteriorly by the vertebral column. The opening for the Vena Cava is more or less quadrilateral (fora- men quadratum), is situated in the right division of the cordiform tendon, and is entirely tendinous. Through the aortic orifice pass the aorta, the vena azygos major, and the thoracic duct; through the oesophageal opening, the oesopha- gus with the two pneumogastric nerves; through the quadrilateral opening, the vena cava inferior, which is firmly attached to the mar- gins of the opening, and also a branch of the phrenic nerve. The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves pass through a slit in each cms, and the vena azygos minor (if it exists) passes through the left crus! The gangliated cord of the sympathetic is continued into the abdomen from the thorax beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum. ^ The position of the diaphragm alters considerably during inspira- tion, for the muscle then becomes flattened, and slopes downwards and backwards so as to deepen the posterior part of the chest. The diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves from the cervical plexus which, after traversing the thorax, pierce the fibres of the muscle and are distributed principally on its under surface. Its arteries are the phrenic, from the abdominal aorta, on the under surface, and the mus mlo-phrenic from the internal mammary. This last will be seen when the upper surface of the diaphragm is dissected with the Thorax. [The vessels and muscles of the abdominal cavity are now tn I,, cleaned.

Inferior mesenteric 8. Middle sacral. 9. Lumbar arteries. 10. Common iliacs. The Phrenic arteries (Fig. 116, 2) are two small branches, which arise close below the diaphragm and ramify on its under surface, where they form a circle and anastomose with one another and with the internal mammary artery, giving also a branch to the supra-renal capsule. The veins open into'the vena cava. ^ The Cceliac Axis (Fig. 116, 4) is only half an inch in length, and divides at once into the gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries (v. p. 217). The gastric and splenic veins open into the vena porta?, but the hepatic veins which receive the blood from the vena porta? as well as from the hepatic artery in the liver, open into the vena cava. The Superior Mesenteric artery (Fig. 116, 6) supplies all the small and half the large intestine (v. p. 213). Its vein opens into the vena porta?. The Supra-renal arteries (Fig. 116, 7) pass, one on each side, transversely to the supra-renal capsule, the right going beneath the' vena cava. In addition to this artery (middle capsular), the capsule is supplied by a branch from the phrenic (superior), and one from the renal artery (inferior). The right vein enters the vena cava, the left the renal or phrenic vein. The Renal arteries (Fig. 116, 9) arising on each side of the aorta immediately below the capsular arteries, pass transversely to the con- cave border of the kidney, the right going beneath the vena cava. The aorta being a little to the left of the vertebras at this point, the ri^ht renal artery is necessarily slightly longer than the left, and the veins are the reverse, owing to the position of the vena cava on the. right of the column. The renal artery breaks up into three or four branches just as it enters the kidney, and one or more of them may pass in front of the vein, but as a rule the relation of the parts at the hilum ot the kidney is (1) Vein, (2) Artery, (3) Ureter, from before back- wards, the renal or emulgent veins open into the vena cava, the left crossing the aorta. An additional renal artery not unfrequentlv arises from the lower part of the aorta, or from the common iliac artery. The Spermatic arteries (Fig. 116, 10) are two long slender branches which arise from the front of the aorta about an ink below the renal, and pass downwards to the interna] abdominal ring and through the inguinal canal to the testes.

In the female the spermatic arteries become the ovarian, and pass into the pelvis to ramify in the broad ligament of the uterus {Fig. 109, hf. The spermatic veins take a different course on the two sides, the left opening at a right angle into the left renal vein, and the right opening directly into the. vena cava ; which arrangement is said , to account in part for the more frequent occurrence of 'varicocele' on the left side. Dr. J. H. Brinton, of Philadelphia, has demonstrated the existence of a valve at the caval orifice of the vein of the right but not of the left side. The great length of the spermatic arteries is accounted for by the fact that the testicles were originally in the abdomen, opposite the point where the arteries arise, and that as they descended the vessels necessarily became elongated. The Inferior Mesenteric artery (Fig. 116, 12) supplies the lower half of the large intestine (v. p. 216), and its vein opens into the splenic vein. The Middle Sacral (Fig. 116, 18) is a small branch arising at the bifurcation of the aorta and passing down into the pelvis along the middle of the sacrum. It anastomoses with the lateral sacral branches of the internal iliac arteries, and its corresponding vein opens into the left common iliac vein. The Lumbar arteries (Fig. 116,14), four or five in number, arise in a double row from the back of the aorta and pass transversely, close upon the vertebras, beneath the gangliated cords of the sympathetic, and on the right side beneath the vena cava. Only small portions •of these arteries can be seen at present, but when followed out each will be found to divide into an anterior and posterior branch. Of these the anterior runs between the abdominal muscles, and the posterior passes between the transverse processes to the muscles of the back, giving also a branch into the vertebral canal through the mtervertebraUoramen, which supplies the membranes of the cord, and ends in the body of the vertebra. The lumbar veins open into the vena cava. The Common Iliac Arteries (Fig. 116, 16) are the direct con- tinuations of the abdominal aorta, and extend from the left side of the fourth lumbar vertebra to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis where «ach divides into the external and internal iliac arteries. The tMm common iliac is a little longer than the left, and the relations differ on the two sides, owing, principally, to the fact that the Uvo common280 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN, iliac « unite to form the vena cava teal column.

The following is the usual mode of f Pr^e^Sth~External Iliac aTterV) a iunated incision three and a half inches long is to be made about an inch above and parallel to Poupart's ligament (Pig. 117, a). The tendon of the external oblique and the fleshy fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are to be divided in the same direction and to the same extent, and it is usual to divide the transversalis on a director to avoid the possibility of injuring the peritoneum. Care must also be taken not to divide the epigastric artery. The fascia transversalis, now exposed, is to be divided on a director, and the peritoneum is then to be carefully stripped up from the iliac fossa and turned forward with the viscera, the ureter and spermatic vessels generally adhering to the membrane and being therefore drawn out of the way. The finger can now reach the inner border of the psoas, at which the artery can be felt, but the sheath must be carefully opened before the needle can be passed between the vein and the artery. The vessel should be tied as nearly as possible midway between the origins of the internal iliac and epigastric arteries. The Internal and Common Iliac arteries may be tied through aDEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 232 similar incision prolonged to a length of about five inches (Fig. 117, b), or "by one of similar length placed so that its centre is opposite the anterior superior iliac spine. The steps of the proceeding are the same as those for tying the external iliac, but the operations are more arduous, owing to Fig. 117. the greater depth of the arteries and the conse- quent difficulty in reach- ing them. When the external iliac artery is tied, the circula- tion in the lower limb is carried on principally by the internal iliac, the branches of which (gluteal, sciatic, and obturator) anas- tomosefreelywith branches of the profunda femoris. In addition, the anasto- moses between the epigas- tric and the internal mam- mary branch of the sub- clavian, and between the circumflex iliac and the lumbar arteries, become greatly developed. If the internal iliac were tied, a return current would be established from the profunda femoris to the branches before mentioned, whilst the visceral branches would be supplied by free anastomoses from the vessels of the opposite side. When the common iliac is tied, the circulation in the limb depends mainly upon the internal mammary and epigastric, aided by blood brought circuitously from the opposite internal iliac to that of the same side, and thence to the profunda femoris. The middle sacral artery would also form a direct com- munication between the aorta and the lateral sacral branch of the internal iliac. The Kidney (Fig. 113, 14) may be roughly said to lie between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. It generally, however, reaches Fig. 117.—(From Fergusson's 'Practical Surgery.')

It is continuous with the iliac fascia in the pelvis, and passes upwards over the psoas to be attached to the lower edge of the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, and to the sides of the bodies of the vertebra from which the muscle takes its origin. It is owing to this fascia that " psoas abscess," the result of diseased spine, is conducted along the psoas muscle to the inner side of the thigh. The Iliac fascia covers the iliacus interims muscle and is con- tinuous with the fascia over the psoas magnus, being strengthened234 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. at the lower part by an expansion from the psoas parvus, when that muscle is present. The iliac fascia should be traced to Poupart's ligament, beneath which it passes to unite with the fascia transversalis in forming the sheath of the femoral vessels (v. p. 87). The Psoas Magnus muscle (Fig. 118, 6) arises from the sides of the bodies and roots of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae, and from their intervertebral substances. A series of tendinous arches from which muscular fibres arise, con- nected with the intervertebral substance and upper border of each vertebra, will be seen to spring across the hollow in the side of the body to become attached to the lower border of the same vertebra and to the next intervertebral substance ; and thus the lumbar vessels are protected from pressure. The muscle passes along the border of the true pelvis in close relation to the iliac vessels, and disappears beneath Poupart's ligament to be inserted by a tendon into the back of the lesser trochanter of the femur. The Psoas Parvus (Fig. 118, 4) is a small muscle occasionally found upon the front of the psoas magnus. It arises from the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae, and ends in a long tendon, which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and part of the ilio- pectineal line, giving an expansion to the iliac fascia. The Iliacus Internus (Fig. 118, 8) lies in the iliao fossa, from the greater part of which it arises, as well as from the ilio-lunibar ligament and the base of the sacrum. A few fibres also are attached to the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. The fleshy fibres of the iliacus are united with the tendon of the psoas at its insertion into the femur. The psoas and the iliacus are flexors and rotators outwards of the thigh, but taking their fixed point below are flexors of the trunk upon the thisdi. This is seen in dislocation of the femur downwards into the thyroid foramen, when the body is always bowed forwards owing to the tension of these muscles. The psoas is supplied by the lumbar nerves, the iliacus by the anterior crural nerve. The Q-uadratus Lumborum (Fig. 118, 5) is the short muscle filling the space between the last rib and the crista ilii. It has its origin below, from the posterior portion of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium and from the.acljacent ilio-lumbar ligament; and ascends to be inserted into the lower border of the last rib, and by three or four slips into the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar verte- brae. It is sometimes described as consisting of two distinct parts. The quadratus draws down the ribs and is therefore a muscle of expi- ration ; it is supplied by the posterior branches of the lumbar nerves.235 THE LUMBAR PLEXUS. Twelfth dorsal nerve (Fig. 118, 3).—Crossing the quadratic, and immediately below the ligamentum arcuatum externum, will be found a large nerve, the twelfth dorsal, which will be seen to disappear through the transversalis muscle, and must not be confounded with the branches of the lumbar plexus. The Lumbar Plexus (Fig. 118).—At the outer border of the psoas, and about midway between the last rib and the crest of the ilium will be found two small nerves (often united), crossing the quadratus obliquely and piercing the abdominal muscles immediately above the crest, and generally close together. These are the ilio- hypogastric (7) and ilio-inguinal (9) nerves, and their size varies, considerably in different subjects, one being often larger than the other, or there being one trunk* only which subdivides in the abdo- minal wall. The after-course of the nerves has been given in the dissection of the abdominal wall, the ilio-hypogastric being distri- buted to the skin of the lower part of the abdomen and by its dorsal branch to the buttock, and the ilio-inguinal emerging from the external abdominal ring to supply the scrotum. The' Genito-crural nerve (11) appears on the front of the psoas at its upper part, and is of small size. It descends on the muscle,, and divides into a genital (29) branch which accompanies the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal to the cremaster, and a crural (27) branch which runs under Poupart's ligament to the. outer side of the external iliac artery, and is lost in the skin of the. thigh. The External cutaneous nerve (15) appears at the outer border of the psoas just below the level of the crista ilii. It crosses obliquely to the anterior superior spinous process, close to which it passes under Poupart's ligament to the outer side of the thigh. (This frequently comes from the anterior crural nerve and is nearly transverse in its. direction.) The Anterior crural (23) is the large nerve lying close to the outer border of the psoas at its lower part, and imbedded in the iliacus. It passes under Poupart's ligament into the thigh, but in the abdomen gives branches to the iliacus internus muscle. The Obturator nerve (25) will be better dissected with the pelvis,, but if desired may be seen passing below the brim of the true pelvis to disappear through the upper part of the thyroid foramen. An Accessory Obturator nerve is occasionally found arising with the obturator nerve, which is then diminished in size. The accessory nerve passes over the brim of the pelvis beneath the psoas, and joins the obturator nerve on the inner side of the thigh.236 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. [The psoas should be carefully removed piecemeal on one side, in order to dissect the lumbar nerves to their origins, and to trace out the plexus completely.] The Lumbar plexus will now be seen to be formed by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and part of the 4th lumbar nerves, with a branch from the 12th Fig. 118.

Thus it will be seen that the- origins of the nerves are very simple, a nerve being added or sub- tracted in regular sequence, as follows :— / 1 . . . Iliohypogastric and iUo-inguinal. \ 1 2 . .

Sympathetic Nerve (Fig. 113).—On each side of the aorta and close to the crura of the diaphragm will be seen an irregular mass of a somewhat crescentic form, called the semi-lunar ganglion, and into it the great splanchnic nerve from the thoracic ganglia may be traced. The Solar plexus is formed by fibres crossing from one semi-lunar ganglion to the other, and receives a branch from the right pneumo- gastric. Its continuation, the aortic plexus, will have been more or less seen in cleaning the aorta, and so also the secondary plexuses derived from it and distributed upon the several branches, viz., the phrenic plexus, gastric plexus, hepatic plexus, splenic plexus, superior- mesenteric plexus, supra-renal plexus, renal plexus, spermatic plexus, and inferior mesenteric plexus. In addition to the great splanchnic nerve, the lesser splanchnic nerve may, in a favourable subject, be- traced into the cceliac plexus, and the third or least splanchnic nerve into the renal plexus. The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 118, i) will be found on each side of the spinal column, and behind the vena cava upon the right side. A ganglion is situated opposite each vertebra, and branches of communication may be traced from each, which may be- divided into (1) those communicating with the ganglia above and below; (2) those communicating with the spinal nerves, which are- often two in number and join the nerves above and below each ganglion ; (3) ^ branches to the plexuses upon the neighbouring: arteries supplying the viscera. Some lymphatic glands (lumbar) may also be found by the side- of the aorta at the lower part, which receive the lymphatics from the testis, and are therefore affected in malignant diseases of that organ.VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 238 The Vena Azygos Major may be seen lying close to the right side of the aorta, and communicating with one or more of the lumbar veins. It passes through the aortic opening. The Vena Azygos Minor (if it exists) may be seen to commence in the left lumbar veins, and to pass through the left-cms of the diaphragm. Receptaculum Chyli.-By detaching the right crus of the dia- phragm from the vertebrae, and if necessary, removing a piece of the aorta'oppo'site the upper lumbar vertebras, the receptaculum chyli, an irregular tube about two inches long, will be seen lying to the right side°of the aorta, opposite the second lumbar vertebra. It receives the lymphatics andlacteals of the abdomen, and is continued upwards as the thoracic duct. The subject will now be turned for the dissection of the back, and the dissectors of the abdomen should occupy the time with the examination of the viscera. Viscera of the Abdomen. [The stomach and intestines should be cleaned by allowing a ■stream of water to pass through them ; and the stomach, as well as a piece of small and large intestme, should be distended with air by means of a blow-pipe, so as to permit of dissection of its coats.] The Stomach (Fig. 119) presents a lesser and a greater curvature at its upper and lower borders, and a greater and lesser end. The oreat end is the dilatation on the left side of the body near the en- trance of the oesophagus, and is called the cardiac or splenic end, or sometimes known as the fundus. The small or pyloric end presents a small dilatation called the antrum of the pylorus, and terminates m the duodenum, the junction of the two viscera being marked by a thickened band of fibres which can both be seen and felt, and is called the pylorus. The coats of the stomach are four—serous, muscular, areolar, ana mucous. , i The serous coat is continuous with the lesser omentum above, and with the great omentum below ; that in front of the stomach being derived from the greater bag, and that behind from the lesser bag oi the peritoneum. Along the lesser and greater curvatures the two Layers of peritoneum are separated by the pyloric and gastroepiploic Y&tU'muscular coat consists of three sets of unstriped fibres longi- tudinal, circular and oblique. The longitudinal fibres are contmuous239 THE STOMACH. with those of the oesophagus, and, running principally along the lesser curvature, are continued into the duodenum. The circular fibres, which are next in order, enclose the entire viscus, and are collected together at the small end to form the pylorus. The oblique fibres are most internal, and are continuous with the circular fibres of the Fig. 119. oesophagus; they are distributed principally over the great end of the stomach. The areolar or sub-mucous coat consists of areolar tissue in which the blood-vessels ramify, and between this and the mucous coat is a fine layer of involuntary muscle the muscularis mucosas. On laying open the stomach along its lesser curvature, the mucous membrane will be seen to be arranged in longitudinal folds or ridges called rugce, which disappear when the viscus is distended and are Fig. 119.—"Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum (from Wilson). 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.

Each villus is a prolongation of the mucous membrane, formed of lymphoid tissue and covered with columnar epithelium. It contains in its centre a single or double lacteal, surrounded by a delicate layer of involuntary muscle prolonged from the muscularis mucosae; external to which is a capillary plexus, with the basement-membrane on which the epithe- lium rests (Fig. 123). The capillary plexus is supplied by a small artery passing up one side of the villus, and ends in a vein running down the opposite side (Fig. 124). Lieberkiihn's follicles (Fig. 127, 2) are minute tubes, which are placed between the villi, and resemble the mucous glands of the stomach ; they dip into the submucous areolar tissue, and are lined with columnar epithelium.

The pancreatic lies close to the bile duct, and the two pierce the duodenal wall together, opening usually by a common orifice. Occasionally there is a separate duct from the head of the pancreas opening into the duodenum by itself. The pancreas derives its blood from the splenic and from the superior and inferior pan- creatico-duodenal arteries ; its nerves from the solar plexus.

Each in- tralobular vein passes out of the lobule at right angles to the portal vessels, and unites with other in- tralobular veins to form the sublobular veins ; these open into the vena; cavce hepaticw or hepatic veins, which have been traced into the vena cava.

It gives off vaginal branches which run in the portal canals, and capsular branches which supply the fibrous tissue on the surface, the blood being eventually returned into branches of the portal vein. The interlobular branches accompany the inter- lobular veins, and their blood enters the plexus within the lobules from which the bile is secreted. The Kidney (Fig. 116).is convex on its anterior and flattened on its posterior surface, and its upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower. Its outer border is convex and regular, while the internal is notched at the point where the vessels enter. An average kidney measures about four inches in length, two-and-a-half in breadth, and rather over an inch in thickness. Its weight in the male is about 4^ ounces, and rather less in the female. The renal artery enters, and the renal vein and ureter emerge at a slit on the inner border called the hilum, and the trunks of the vessels have the following relation from before backwards, viz., vein, artery, and ureter (compare vessels entering transverse fissure of liver in the reverse order, p. 250). Yery generally, however, one of the branches of the renal artery will enter the hilum in front of the vein. The ureter, if traced upwards, will be found to expand, forming the pelvis of the kidney, and it should be noticed that the pelvis has a direction downwards, so that by referring to this, to the position of the vessels, and to the flattening of the posterior surface, the side to which the kidney belongs can be readily ascertained. The kidney is enclosed in a tough fibrous capsule, which may be peeled off to see the kidney substance. To see the internal structure of the organ it should be opened through the convex border by a vertical incision, which is to be carried into the pelvis. The Pelvis (Fig. 138, 6) will be found to be subdivided at the upper, middle, and lower part of the kidney into three portions, which are called the Infunclibula ($), and are "again subdivided into the Galices. Projecting into the calices are small nodules of kidney substance termed the papillce or mammillae (4), which will be seen to be the apices of certain triangular dark-coloured bodies called the pyramids of Malpighi or cones (3). These pyramids, which are arranged more or less regularly side by side, constitute what is called the tubular or medullary substance of the kidney, the lighter granular portion at the margin of the section being the cortical substance (2) The renal artery breaks up into four or five branches, which again subdivide and pass between the pyramids to the cortical substance forming arches between the cortical and medullary portion FromVISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 254 these the interlobular arteries arise, which pass between the sub- divisions of the cortical substance or pyramids of Ferrein and give off Fig. 138.

The tube then becomes suddenly smaller, and passes for a variable distance into the pyramid, again curving upon itself to reach the cortical portion, where the diameter increases and the tube opens into the straight or collecting tubes of the pyramids. These small tubes are known as the looped tubes of Henle (Fig. 142). The uriniferous tubes of the pyramids converge at their apices, where they empty themselves into the calices j from these the urine passes into the infundibula, and thence into the pelvis and ureter. The relation of the epithelium to the blood-vessels of the Mal- pighian body is uncertain. The capsule is lined with pave- Fig. 140.—Plan of the renal circulation (from Wilson, after Bowman). a.

The convoluted tubes are lined with similar flattened epithelium, but the looped tubes, as they increase in diameter, are filled with granular epi- thelium. The large collect- ing tubes have a distinct columnar epithelium (Fig. 141). Between the straight tu- buli of the medullary por- tion are numerous straight arteries, which are recur- rent branches from the arches between the cortical and medullary substances, and these are joined by the straight efferent vessels of some of the deeper glome- ruli. The renal artery also supplies the fibrous cap- sule of the kidney with branches, which anasto- mose with the lumbar arteries from the aorta.

The Supra-Renal Capsule (Fig. 138, i) is irregularly triangular in shape, or is commonly said to resemble a cocked hat. Its height is from 1^ to If inch, and its breadth about l£ inch. It is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and on section will be seen to consist of two parts, cortical and medullary, the latter being generally broken clown in the centre by decomposition so as to form a cavity. The cortical portion (Fig. 143) consists of polyhedral cells arranged in columns, radiating from the centre, and held in position by septa continuous with the fibrous envelope. The medullary portion consists of a very fine network of connec- tive tissue, containing cavities filled with cells, which are by some observers thought to be nerve cells, and continuous with the numerous branches of the sympa- thetic which go to the organ from the solar and renal plexuses. The supra-renal capsule is abundantly supplied with arterial blood from the phrenic aorta, renal, and lumbar arteries. Its function is unknown The subject being replaced on its back, the dissectors should pro- ceed with the examination of the pelvis, unless they were unable to finish the aorta, lumbar plexus, and iliac arteries before the body was turned, m which case they must revert to the dissection of them at once {v. p. 226). In any case the dissector is strongly advised to read through the dissection of the deep parts of the abdomen atin before proceeding any further.

In addition, it gives a thin layer to the under surface of the levator ani, called the anal fascia (Fig. 146), which is lost on the rectum and external sphincter, and was seen in the dissection of the perinaaum. The recto-vesical layer is seen within the pelvis, and is continued over the internal surface of the levator ani to the bladder, forming the lateral true ligaments, and from the back of the pubes, forming the Fig. 146. anterior true (pubo-prostatic) ligaments of the bladder ; whilst between them it is seen to dip down to the prostate, of which it forms the capsule, and is thus continued from one side to the other of the pelvis, of which it closes the outlet. The recto-vesical fascia is continuous behind with the fascia covering the pyriformis, coccygeus, and sacral plexus, and on each side with the obturator fascia already described. J he line along which the recto-vesical is continuous with the obturator iascia extends from the back of the pubes to the spine of the ischium and corresponds to the origin of the levator ani muscle. This is com- monly known as the "white Hue » (Fig. 144,18), but is often wanting the nbres of the levator ani passing upwards beyond the position of the white line, and thus separating the obturator from the uelvic fascia (Quam).

The neck of the bladder is the narrowed portion attached to the prostate, and the remainder of the viscus is termed the body. The upper part of the body is the apex or summit, to which the obliterated urachus is attached, and over which the obliterated hypogastric arteries pass to the abdominal wall. The base or fundus of the bladder is the lowest part of the organ, which is seen to rest on the horizontal portion of the rectum, with the vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia intervening. The peritoneum is reflected from the second portion of the rectum on to the fundus of the bladder at the level of the entrance of the ureters, and is then continued over the back of the bladder until it is reflected over the urachus to the abdominal wall, leaving the anterior surface uncovered. It should be noticed how much the extent of bladder uncovered by peritoneum, both above and below, depends upon the distension of the viscus ; since, in the contracted state its anterior surface is in contact with the pubes, whilst in the distended condition it rises above the bone and is in contact with the posterior surface of the abdominal muscles, and thus tapping above the pubes without injury to the serous membrane is possible. The depth of the recto-vesical pouch will similarly be found to vary, the peri- toneum reaching nearer to the prostate when the bladder is empty than when it is full; consequently the operation of tapping by the rectum can be only safely undertaken when the bladder is distended. Cripps gives the average distance of the recto-vesical pouch from the anus as 2| inches when both rectum and bladder are empty, and 3£ inches when the bladder is distended. The left Ureter (Fig. 147, 12) descending from the kidney is contained in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, and can now be traced beneath the peritoneum to its entrance into the posterior part of the fundus of the bladder, at a point nearly opposite the posterior extremity of the vesicula seminalis. The left Vas Deferens (Fig. 147, 8) can be traced from the testicle, and has been seen to turn down into the pelvis to the inner side of the external iliac artery, after leaving the inguinal canal It is now seen to wind over the back of the bladder, crossing the oblite- rated hypogastric artery, and to be continued beneath the peritoneum to the fundus of the bladder, where it hooks round the ureter to become internal to it; the vas will be afterwards traced to the prostate.266 THE pelvis. The Prostate Gland (Fig. 147, 17) is now seen in front of the Madder, and enclosed by a process of recto-vesical fascia which trams the capsule of the gland. It is placed over the commencement ot the third part of the rectum, and in front of, hut below the level of, the bladder. In old age the prostate is frequently enlarged m which case it presses upon the rectum as well as upon the urethra; the latter passes through its substance nearer the upper than the lower surface Within the capsule derived from the recto-vesical lascia is the special fibrous capsule of the gland ; between the two is the large prostatic plexus of veins. TA transverse cut is now to be made at the bottom of the recto- JyS which will allow the bladder to be drawn forward Xn a Stle dLection will expose the surface of the viscus uncovered by peritoneum and lying over the rectum.] The portion of the base of the bladder uncovered by peritoneum is triangular in shape,and is bounded on each and vesiculce seminales ; the base of the triangle is formed by the re- flection of peritoneum at the line of the entrance of the ure ers and the apex is at the back of the prostate. It is here that the bladder is opened when punctured from the rectum. A process of the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia can now be traced between the rectum and bladder, giving a covering to those organs, to the prostate, and to the vesicuhe seminales. The Vesicul* Seminales (Fig. 147, 14) are two convoluted sacs situated on the under surface of the bladder, and converging to enter e prostate close to the median line. They are somewhat expanded at their posterior extremities, which are about two inches apart and reach nearly to the recto-vesical pouch. They have the vasa deferent* lying close to their inner sides, and together they form the sides ot the triangle mentioned above. The mm defercntm become somewhat enlarged as they pass be- neaSthe bladcler ; they lie close to the inner sides of the resicul* and the duct of each vesicnla joins the corresponding vaa deferens at the prostate, thns forming the common cjacnlatory dmt.

The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) closely resembles that viscus m the male, but is rather larger, and its fundus is in contact with the vagina instead of with the rectum. The Urethra (Fig. 148, 6) in the female is about an inch and a half long, placed immediately beneath the pubes and curved upwards slightly to the bladder. It may be said to correspond to the prostatic and membranous urethra of the male. The Uterus (Fig. 148, 18) is situated behind the bladder, and, it in its proper position and healthy, its upper end or fundus shoiild not reach above a line drawn from the upper edge of the pubic symphysis to the lumbo-sacral articulation (Savage). The uterus is tilted slightly forwards so that its axis corresponds to that ol the pelvis, and its lower end or cervix is received into the upper end ot the vagina. . r , -, * The Broad Ligament (Fig. 109, 6) of the uterus is the fold of peritoneum attached to each side of the fundus, in which are three partial subdivisions, viz., a superior in which is the FaUopian tube an anterior in which is the round ligament of the uterus, and a posterior covering the ovary. The right round ligament of the uterus is now to be traced from the internal abdominal ring to the fundus of the uterus, but the Fallopian tube and ovary may be more conveniently examined with the uterus at a later period. . • The Vagina (Fig. 148, 12) is a curved tube of which the anterior wall is considerably shorter than the posterior, the former m he virgin rarely exceeding two inches in length, but the lat er being nearly twice as long (Savage). It is in contact with the bladder in fron and with the rectum behind at the lower part but the recto- " illpouch of peritoneum intervenes between the two organs above The neck of the uterus projects backwards into the upper extremity of the vagina, and its lower extremity passes through the levator ani muscle and is surrounded by the sphincter vagina, [The viscera of the pelvis being drawn down.to the> le^the internal iliac vessels and sacral plexus of ^$g*Jfi^the examined, and they should also be dissected_on pelvis, which has been preserved lor the ]urpos^e ^es 0*f be taken to trace branches of the sympathetic neive to the pelvic organs.] The Internal Iliac Artery (Fig. 149, 4) ia a branch of the com-THE INTEENAL ILIAC ARTERY. 269 mon iliac, from which, it comes off at the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, and immediately passes into the pelvis. In the foetus the hypogas- tric artery, the direct continuation of the internal iliac in size and direction, passed forwards over the bladder to the umbilicus, but it is now converted into a fibrous cord, which however is pervious for a short distance, and thus gives branches to the bladder. The inter- nal iliac is crossed bytfche ureter and closely covered by the peritoneum in front; behind it are the internal iliac vein and the lumbosacral cord, with a portion of the pyriforniis muscle. At the upper border of the great sacro-sciatic notch it divides into anterior and posterior trunks, which give branches to the viscera and to the inside and outside of the pelvis. Branches (Fig. 149).—From the anterior division are given off three visceral and three parietal branches ; from the posterior trunk three parietal branches. Visceral branches. Anterior Division.

A middle vesical branch is some- times derived from one of these, and from another is derived the artery of the vas deferens, which accompanies the duct to the testicle and anastomoses with the spermatic artery. 2. The Inferior vesical, and 3, Middle hemorrhoidal (16) arteries genera ly come off together, and are distributed to the under surface of the bladder and vesical* seminales, and to the adjacent portion of the rectum. The middle hemorrhoidal artery anastomoses with thp superior hemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric above and with the inferior hemorrhoidal branch of the pudic artery below 4.

The distribution of the obturator artery out- side the pelvis has been already seen on the right side (p. 258) but may now be followed out on the left side. When the obturator arises from the epigastric artery, there is generally a small branch running in the proper position with the obturator nerve (i\ p. 91). 6. The Pudic (13) and 7, the Sciatic (14) arteries can only be seen for a short distance within the pelvis, as they lie on the pyriformis to pass through the lower part of the greater sacro-sciatic foramen below that muscle. The pudic is generally smaller than the sciatic, and a little in front of it, but the size and relation of the vessels vary. Supposing the perinseum and buttock to have been dissected, the opportunity may be taken to trace the sciatic artery through the great sacro-sciatic foramen to its distribution outside the pelvis, and to follow the pudic in its course around the spine of the ischium, and through the lesser foramen to the perinseum, where it will be seen running close to the margin of the pubes. The three parietal branches from the posterior division of the internal iliac artery are, the gluteal, ilio-lumbar, and lateral sacral arteries. 1. The Gluteal (6) artery is a thick trunk, disappearing at once through the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, between the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerves and above the pyriformis. It supplies muscular branches and a nutritious artery to the pelvis' and is distributed to the buttock (p. 110). 2. The Ilio-lumhar artery passes into the iliac fossa beneath the psoas and iliacus muscles j and then divides into a lumbar branch which anastomoses with the last lumbar artery, and an iliac branch which supphes the iliacus and the bone, anastomosing with the cir- cumflex iliac branch of the external iliac artery. 3 The Lateral sacral artery (often double) descends on the front of the sacrum, internally to the sacral foramina, to the coccyx where it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side and with the sacra media from the aorta. In its course it gives branches which enter the sacral foramina, and to the pyriformis muscle The Veins corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac arW open into the internal iliac vein, with the exception^ the ilio hli and occasionally the lateral sacral veins, which join t^^S" veins.

This foramen is closed by the pyri- formis muscle, above and below which vessels and nerves leave the pelvis. The Levator Ani Muscle (Fig. 151, 23) takes its origin from the back of the pubes, and from the front of the spine of the ischium ; between those points its fibres are usually attached to the white line marking the division of the pelvic fascia, and seen on the dissection of the fascia from without (Fig. 144), but occasionally the fibres arise irom the pelvic fascia an inch above the white line, the obturator fascia being then a separate structure (p. 261). The anterior fibres pass beneath the bladder and prostate to unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe of the perhiEeum, the name levator prostate being sometimes given to those fibres which pass beneath the prostate [m the female they are connected with the vagina] ; the middle fibres are inserted into the rectum and blend with the sphinc- ter ; and the posterior fibres unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe behind the anus, and are attached to the apex of the coccyx.

[The bladder with the urethra and the rectum having been removed as directed, should be laid on the table with the rectum uppermost and that viscus should be filled with cotton-wool and cleaned, and its muscular fibres exposed.] The Rectum is about eight inches long and is generally largest just above the anus, which will be seen to be surrounded by the sphincter muscle. The arrangement' of the peritoneum upon the rectum has been already described (p. 263), and the longitudinal muscular fibres will be now seen to differ from those of the rest of the large intestine, in being spread all around it instead of beino- coUected in three bands. The internal or circular muscular fibres become thickened near the anus to form the internal sphincter muscle, which is best seen when the bowel is opened. The numerous arteries entering the rectum are derived from three sources—the superior hemorrhoidal artery from the inferior mesenteric which may be traced to within three inches of the anus; the middle hemorrhoidal from the internal iliac; and the inferior hemorrhoidal from the internal pudic. The veins open both into the vena portce and the mternal iliac vein. The intestine being opened along its unattached border, the mucous membrane will be seen to be smooth, except near the anus where it is thrown into longitudinal folds by the sphincter Here also it frequently happens that hemorrhoids exist. Three'or four transverse ridges of mucous membrane (valves or folds of Houston) will be found from three to six inches above the anus, which occa- sionally cause difficulty in the introduction of a bougie or rectum, tu be.

The dorsal vein may now be traced to its junction with the plexus of veins around the prostate and neck of the bladder. The Prostate (Fig. 152, 7) is shaped like a chestnut, having the small end or apex in front, and weighs in the adult something less than an ounce. The length of the organ from base to apex is in health from 1J to 1^ inch, and the greatest transverse diameter about If inch (H. Thompson); but these measurements undergo great variation in old persons, the subjects of "enlarged prostate." The prostate consists of two lateral lobes, the division between which is marked by a slight groove on the under surface, the projection in the floor of the urethra described by some authors as the third or middle lobe being the result of morbid changes. A little hollow in the centre of the posterior aspect, or base, receives the common ejaculatory ducts. The structure of the prostate is partly glandular and partly muscular, the fibres (of the unstriped variety) being con- tinuous with those of the bladder. The Vesiculee Seminales (Fig. 152, 9) are two membranous receptacles for the semen, attached to the under surface of the bladder immediately behind the prostate, from which they diverge. Eacli vesicle consists of a convoluted tube, which becomes straight at the base of the prostate, and joins the corresponding vas deferens to form the common ejaculatory duct, to be afterwards seen opening into the urethra. The Bladder (Fig. 152,4).—The peritoneal coat of the bladder has been already dissected (p. 265). The muscular coat consists of three layers, external or longitudinal, middle or circular, and internal (submucous of Ellis), also longitu- dinal. The external layer, sometimes known as the detrusor urince, is attached to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder at the back of the pubes. It is continued over the bladder and joins the posterior part of the prostate. The middle layer consists of circular fibres, which form the sphincter vesica around the neck of the bladder, and are then continued over the prostate. They become more or less oblique in their distribution over the bladder. The internal layer is continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the urethra, and is joined by the fibres of the ureters, which meet in the middle line and are also spread over the trigonum (Ellis) Sir Charles Bell described special muscular bands continued from280 MALE PELVIC VISCERA. the ureters to the hack of the prostate, the existence of which as separate structures is doubtful. According to Dr• Pettigrew, whose beautiful preparations are in the museum of the College of Surgeons of England, the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the bladder is reducible to a series of figure-of-8 loops, the so-called circular fitee. depending upon compression of the two halves of the figure-thus 8 BenSth the muscular is the fibrous coat of the bladder, composed of loose connective tissue. [The bladder is to be opened along its upper surface dinal cut which is to be continued with a strong pair of sensors tCuXtne upper surface of the prostate and the whole length o.the urethra, £ the latter portion being a little to one Bide of the middle line.] Interior of Bladder and Urethra (Figs. 152 and 153).-The « membrane of the bladder, if healthy, will be pale and mo e " less in folds throughout, except near the urethra, where is the triangular space called the trigone vesicale or tngonum vestcce liua sPace0corresponds to that between the vesiculae semmales ex ernaUy L the sides of the triangle are about an inch and a half bug, bein- bounded by the orifices of the ureters, which will be lecog- S as httle slits in the mucous membrane.

The wall of this portion is thin and membra- nous, but it will be seen to be enclosed by circular involuntary fibres continuous with the circular fibres of the bladder and prostate. The mucous membrane is smooth, and presents no orifices ; it is fre- quently stained of a red colour. The Bulbous portion (d) is the part cor- responding to the bulb externally, and is about an inch long, but there is no line of demarcation between it and the spongy portion. The canal is dilated at this spot, and in the floor of it are the two minute orifices of the ducts of Cowper's glands, which rim obliquely through the wall of the urethra for some distance. The cut edge of the bulb will be seen to be con- tinuous with the corpus spongiosum, which surrounds the spongy or thl O^°Sf-i011 °f P°cul?5is isjiyen differ enty by various authors ; oni?nS^ 7 antd™on Place the interior, and Cruveilhier and Ellis vari^m?! ^' P^ °f th?

Its calibre is somewhat smaller than that ot the bulbous portion, but it expands in the glans perns to form tlvz fossa navicularis, again becoming contracted at the meatus or orifice, at which point the urethra is as smaU as in the membranous portion, and occasionally smaller. Along the floor of the spongy portion numerous mucous follicles or lacunce,the orifices of which are directed towards the meatus ; a few similar follicles are situated on the upper surface of the urethra, one of which opposite the fossa naviculars is the lacuna magna. This can seldom be made out when the urethra is opened from above as here directed. The mucous membrane is smooth and pale m health but the student should notice carefully any traces of stricture which will probably be found, if present, in the bulbous V^J^\^ Hum of the posterior part of the urethra is columnar, but it becomes tesselated near the glans penis.

The dorsal vein, with a dorsal artery and nerve on each side of it, lie along the upper surface of the corpora cavernosa. The Testicle (Fig. 155) has already "been seen in its position in the scrotum, and its structure should now be investigated as far asf possible, but cannot be thoroughly seen without mercurial injection. The testis consists of two parts, an anterior or larger portion, the body of the testis, and the accessory and more slender posterior part, the epididymis, which is to the outer side of the body, and from the lower end of which the vas deferens or duct arises. The testicle has three tunics or coverings. The tunica vaginalis (i) is a serous covering derived originally from the peritoneum, and described as consisting of two portions, the tunica vaginalis propria, which covers the organ, and the tunica vagincdis reflexa or re- flected portion. The tunica albuginea (2) is a fibrous covering enclosing the body of the testis, and sending into its centre a vertical process called the mediastinum (3) or corpus Highmorianum. From this, secondary processes or septa are derived, which separate the lobules of the testicle. The tunica albuginea is inseparably connected with the tunica vaginalis, thus forming a fibro-serous membrane. The tunica vasculosa (4) is beneath the tunica albuginea, and contains the- ramifications of the blood-vessels, which cannot be seen except when finely injected. The Epididymis (Fig. 156) is divided into three parts. The upper extremity is the head or globus major (7), which is divisible into coni vasculosi; the central portion is the body (8), and the lower ex- tremity the tail or globus minor (9), which is larger than the body, but not so large as the head. From this the vas deferens (10) or duct of the testicle arises, and close to its point of origin may Fig. 155.—Transverse section of the testicle (from Wilson). 3. 1.

[The organs removed from the pelvis are to be laid out upon the table with the rectum upwards-; this is to be cleaned, and after it has been examined is to be dissected from the uterus.] The Eectum (Fig. 148, 19) corresponds in all particulars to that of the male, but is sometimes much distended. The description of the rectum will be found at page 277. [The preparation being reversed, the bladder and urethra are next to be dissected and examined. The peritoneum is to be dissected ur, from the bladder and left attached to the uterus.] ai&sected up The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) is more capacious than in the male and is directly continuous with the urethra without the intervention of a prostate, the relation to the vesicuhe seminales and vasa deferent* being of course wanting. The bladder is firmly attached to the neck of the uterus and front waU of the vagina. On each side of the upper part of the vagina the ureters ton upwards to gain the sides of the bladder, running obliquely for a short distance in the vesico-vagmal septum, then forwards obliquely through its coats to open by two orifices an inch and a half apart, about where they would open m the male (Savage).

The Great sacro-sciatic ligament (2) is broad at its upper attach- ment, which is to the posterior inferior spine of the ilium and to the sides of the sacrum and coccyx, and narrows to its insertion into the inner and hack part of the tuberosity of the ischium. A portion of this ligament, by its falciform prolongation to the ramus of the ischium, has been seen to protect the pudic vessels and nerve. The Lesser sacro-sciatic ligament (3) is attached to the side of the sacrum and coccyx close to, but in front of, the great ligament, and reaches to the spine of the is- Fig. 158. chium; - thus separating the greater from the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen. Articulation of the Sa- crum and Coccyx.—The ante- rior sacro-coccygeal ligament is a thin fasciculus, passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament is attached to the lower opening of the sacral canal, and passes along the whole length of the posterior surface of the coccyx. A small inter-articular carti- lage intervenes between the sa- crum and coccyx, and the cornua of the latter are connected to the tormer by short ligamentous bands. The Obturator Ligament (Fig. 158, 5) is a fibrous membrane filling up the obturator hole except at its upper part, where an opening is left for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. It gives origin to the fibres of the obturator externus and interims muscles by its outer and inner surfaces.

[The Student is requested to read the 'Introduction' before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.'] Before beginning the dissection the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of tbe part, and the relation of surface-markings to deeper structures. If he has already dissected this region, he should make the irxcisxons necessary for ex- posing the common carotid artery and the third part of the sub c avian artery, and may also advantageously perform the Wf^*^ gotomy and tracheotomy, and practise extraction of the teeth and ?he operation for plugging the posterior nares which last can be done with a flexible catheter. The surface of the scalp presen t . nothing worthy of note, but in a well-injected body the temporal artery will be prominent, and arteriotomy may be performed upon it. The superficial appearances on the face will be.describedmore particularly under that head, and reference may be made to that «prtion now if time allows. . In the neck, the median line is the boundary of the disseetoon, and mesents the following prominences and depressions, which thould be fully recognised with the finger.

The clavicle and sternum bound the dissection below, and across the side, of the neck the prominence of the sterno-mastoid marks the division into anterior and posterior triangles ; in an injected body the carotid artery may be felt near the middle of the anterior border of this muscle. The external jugular vein, if full of blood, will probably be seen crossing the sterno-mastoid obliquely, and may be opened secundum artem by an incision parallel to the muscle. It will be found to be impossible to dissect both sides of the head and neck simultaneously, and the students should therefore arrange to work together, and to take turns at dissecting and reading. The dissection of both sides of the scalp should be completed on the first day, in order that the brain may be removed on the second morning. The Scalp. [The head being shaved and raised on a block, one incision is to be carried from the root of the nose to the occiput, and another at right angles to it from the front of the ear across the head to the corresponding point on the opposite side, and the flaps thus marked out are to be dissected by beginning at the top of the head. Great care must be taken to remove only the skin and not the subcutaneous tosues, which are very thin ; the best guides are the roots of the hair which should be exposed on the under surface of the flaps The ffi^t^f11 muscles of the externaiear ^« The Muscles of the Pinna (Fig. 159) are the Attollens aurem (c) (superior) the Attrahens aurem (i) (anterior), and the Betrahmi aurem, (9) (posterior).

The posterior turns back above the ear and anastomoses with the occipital artery. r„~+rt+W* The Temporal vein is formed by branches corresponding to those of the artery, and disappears in the parotid gland to join the internal maxillary vein, and form the external jugular vein. Surgery-It is on the anterior branch of the temporal artery tha the opfration of arteriotomy is performed when itis desixed toabstract blood from the head. In the operation it is necessary to make only a puncture in the artery, and, when sufficient blood divide the vessel, in order that the ends may be able to retract and urevent the formation of a false aneurism. ^TU Posterior Aurkular nerve (13) [facial] will be found immediately behind the ear and running over the mastoid P^-'T; panying artery. It is distributed to the posterior belly of the oeeipito frontalis and to the attollens and retrahens aurem muscles.

The Occipital Artery [external carotid] lies close to the great occip- ital nerve, but its relation to it is inconstant. It ramifies on the back of the scalp, anastomosing with the artery of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and temporal arteries of the same side. The vein opens into the internal jugular. The Temporal Fascia will be fully exposed by removing the temporal artery and the branches of nerves over it. It is attached above to the temporal ridge on the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones, and below to the zygoma, where it is split so as to be attached to both lips of its upper border ; between the layers are the small orbital branch of the temporal artery and the temporal branch of the orbital nerve of the superior maxillary. It is pierced by the middle temporal artery and the temporal branch of the orbital nerve, and gives origin to fibres of the temporal muscle by its deep surface. The Temporal Muscle will be exposed in part by removing the fascia covering it. It arises from the temporal fossa and from the under surface of the temporal fascia, and its fibres are seen to con- verge to a tendon, which will be found to be inserted into the coronoid process of the lower jaw in a subsequent dissection. Eemoval op the Brain. [Both sides of the scalp having been dissected, the knife should be drawn round the skull, marking out a line an inch above the orbit in front, and half an inch above the occipital protuberance behind, and passing through the temporal muscle between those points. The outer plate of the skull is to be carefully sawn through, particularly at the anterior and posterior extremities of the temporal ridge, and at the occiput. With the chisel the remaining thickness of the skull can then be readily divided without injuring the brain, and the calvana removed.] Upon Removing the Skull-cap the rough outer surface of the dura mater will be seen, and it should be noticed that it formed the internal periosteum of the calvaria, which will be found to be bare The inner surface of the skull-cap presents a longitudinal groove in the median lme, which corresponds to the superior longitudinal sinus and on each side may frequently be seen depressions of variable size corresponding to the Pacchionian bodies. The groove for the middle meningeal artery will be seen on the inner surface of the parietal bone. The dura mater is cream coloured, but often has a bluish appearance, resulting from its translucency, which allows the veins of298 KEMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. the surface of the brain to he partially seen. On each side of the middle line will he seen the glandule Pacchionii, which are fibrous growths from the pia mater, and frequently project through the dura mater and indent the skull. Ramifying upon the dura mater will be found the large middle meningeal artery [internal maxillary], and in a well injected body the anterior meningeal [ethmoidal] may some- times be seen. , „ , The Superior Longitudinal Sinus (Fig. 160, i) should be opened at once. It runs along the middle line of the head and will be seen to be triangular in section, being formed by a splitting of the dura mater and lined with venous endothelium. It commences in a small vein which enters the skull from the nose through the foramen cajcum, and, running along the whole length of the upper border of the falx cerebri, it ends in the torcular Herophih. Within the sinus may be seen some small tendinous cords-c/wnto Willisvi, and also the orifices of the veins opening into it, which all pass from behind forwards, i.e., contrary to the current of blood m the sinus itself.

The 5th pair (trifacial) will be found to be composed of two parts, the larger superior one being sensory, and the deeper one, which is anterior at its origin, motor in function. The 6th pair (abducentes) will be found nearer the median line. The 7th consists of two distinct nerves with a small intermediate portion. The anterior is the facial nerve, and the posterior the auditory, the intervening portion being called the pars intermedia. The entire nerve is seen to disappear through the meatus auditorius intemus with an accompanying auditory artery. The 8th pair consists of three distinct nerves. The most anterior fibres form the small Glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which pierces the dura mater separately; the next and largest portion is the Pneumo-gastric or Vagus; and the part coming out of the foramen magnum is the Spinal-accessory. The whole nerve disappears through the foramen lacerum posterius or jugular hole. The 9th (hypoglossal) nerve consists of two bundles placed near the median line, which pierce the dura mater at separate points to pass together through the anterior condyloid foramen. The Veins of Galen, which pass from the brain to the anterior border of the tentorium, should be divided so that the fold of dura mater may be quite free. The knife is now to be pushed through the foramen magnum so as to divide all the parts passing into the skull, viz., the spinal cord and its membranes, the two vertebral arteries, the small spinal vessels, and the two spinal accessory nerves ; and it should be noticed that the cord can be cut considerably lower than the point at which the vertebral arteries enter the spinal canal. The brain can now be lifted out of the skull, by slipping the fingers beneath the cerebellum and allowing the head to fall back. [Before placing the brain in methylated spirit, the dissectors should pick off the arachnoid and the pia mater from the base, and carefully lay out the nerves in the proper positions, taking care not to_ interfere with the arteries. The brain should be placed in a pan witn the base upwards, and with a piece of calico bandage beneath it, so that it may be easily lifted out; but if too decomposed to be worth preserving, the vessels of .the base should be dissected at once.] The Dura Mater and Sinuses op the Skull. The Dura Mater is firmly attached to the base of the skull and sends processes through the several foramina to form sheaths for the nerves. It is continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord through the foramen magnum, to the margin of which it is closely attached.300 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER.

The Tentorium Cerebelli (Fig. 160, 8) is the horizontal process of dura mater placed between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and when perfect it leaves only an oval opening of small size, through which the crura cerebri, the superior peduncles of the cerebellum and the posterior cerebral arteries pass. In front it is attached to the •anterior and posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone and the superior border of the petrous bone, and behind it is attached to the upper margin of the lateral sinus where it grooves the occipital, parietal, and temporal bones. The Falx Minor (Fig. 160, 14) or falx cerebelli is below the tentorium in the median line, and reaches to the foramen magnum, being attached to the median ridge of the occipital bone. It generally divides below, sending a slip to each side of the foramen magnum. The Sinuses are the venous canals of the skull into which the veins of the brain, orbit, and diploe empty themselves, and differ from the ordinary veins, (1) in not having the usual venous coats but being formed by layers of the dura mater lined with venous endo- thelium, and therefore remaining patent when divided; (2) in having no valves ; and (3) that the veins open into them hi a direc- tion contrary to that of the current of blood within them. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus (Fig. 160, 1) runs along the upper border of the falx major (v. p. 298), and along its lower border is a much smaUer canal, the Inferior Longitudinal Sinus (4) This begins about the middle of the falx and opens into the straight sinus. & The Straight Sinus (Fig. 160, 10) must be opened along the line of attachment of the falx to the tentorium. It is formed by the vena Galeni of the brain and the inferior longitudinal sinus, and opens into the torcular Herophili, thus connecting the two longi- tudinal sinuses together.

The Inferior Petrosal Sinus (Pig. 161, 14) will he opened by carrying the knife from the foramen jugulare, directly forwards along the lower border of the petrous bone to the clinoid process. It communicates with the cavernous sinus, and with the jugular vein outside the skull, passing through the foramen jugulare Si front of the 8th pair. The Cavernous Sinus (Fig. 161, 8) is placed by the side of the pituitary body, and requires careful dissection on account of the nerves in relation with it. They are the 3rd, 4th, ophthalmic division of the 5th, and 6th, and their positions should be at once ascertained. The 3rd, of good size (1), will be recognised close behind the anterior clinoid process ; the 4th, very small (3), in the cut edge of the tentorium; the ophthalmic division of the 5th, the largest and somewhat flattened out (5), will be seen immediately beneath the tentorium ; and the 6th, piercing the dura mater nearer the median line, upon the basilar process (9).

It is formed upon the larger or sensory portion of the 5th, and the smaller or motor portion passes beneath it. From the ganglion the three great divisions of the 5th are to be traced as follows :-The first or ophthalmic division to the sphenoidal fissure ; the second or superior maxillary division to the foramen rotundum; and the third or inferior maxillary division to the foramen ovale. The motor trunk of the nerve joins this last division outside the skull. The ophthal mic division is seen to pass along the outer side of the cavemo™ sinus, and to give off a branch (nasal) before it enters the sphenoid fissure.

Care must be taken as soon as the upper border of the platysma is reached to keep close to the skin, or the superficial nerves may be injured. The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 164, 6) is only seen now in its lower part, the remainder of it will be found in the dissection of the anterior triangle and face. It is a subcutaneous muscle arising from the fascia over the pectoral and deltoid muscles, and very slightly from the front of the clavicle ; it passes obliquely across the neck to be inserted into the lower border of the lower jaw near the symphysis and into the side of the mouth, the fibres of opposite sides interlacing below the symphysis, and the muscle if well developed reaching as high as the zygoma. It is supplied by the superficial cervical nerve. Through the platysma will generally be seen the External Jugular Vein (Fig. 164, 13), which, it is to be noticed, runs parallel or nearly so to the fibres of the muscle ; if therefore, in bleeding from the jugular, an incision were made in the direction of the vein there would be no opening by which the blood might escape, and hence the rule m practice, viz., to cut parallel to the sterno-mastoid t.e., across the fibres of the platysma, so that they may retract The Platysma is to be detached from the clavicle and turned forward, and the Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus are to be found These are in two sets,-the ascending, comprising the Superficial Cervical, Great Auricular, and Small Occipital nerves and the descending set comprising the Sternal, Clavicular, and Acromial branches. a.

The Frontal Nerve (Fig. 169, 8) [5th], the largest nerve entering through the sphenoidal fissure, lies in the centre of the orbit and divides at its anterior part into the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear branches ; these turn round the margin of the orbit to the forehead, the supra-orbital through the supra-orbital notch, and the supra- trochlear close to the inner angle of the orbit. Frequently the supra- trochlear nerve, the more internal of the two, is double. The Lachrymal Nerve (Fig. 169, 12) [5th] lies on the outer side of the orbit and passes to the lachrymal gland, which it sup- plies. It frequently sends a branch to the forehead close to the outer angle of the orbit, which forms a junction with the temporo-malar nerve. The Supra-Orbital Artery (Fig. 170, 8) is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, and accom- panies the supra-orbital nerve to the forehead. The Lachrymal Artery (Fig. 170, 12) is a smaller branch also from the ophthalmic, and supplies the lachrymal gland.

It secretes the tears, which its ducts, seven or eight in number, carry to the surface of the conjunctiva beneath the upper eyelid. TThe frontal nerve is to be divided, and a hook inserted into the upper eyelid so as to put the levator palpebral in the centre of the oibit on the stretch ; this muscle and the superior oblique are then to be cleaned, care being taken not to destroy the little pulley through which the tendon of the latter works.] The Obliquus Superior (Fig. 169, 3) » the most superficial muscle of the orbit at its origin, which is from the upper margin of the optic foramen, above and a little to the inner side oj.the levator palpebra. It lies superficially along the inner side of the orbit and ends in a round tendon which, passing through the trochlea or pulley- like rin- of fibrous tissue attached to the frontal bone, turns down abruptly to the eye-ball. The tendon becomes flattened near its m - sertion, and passes beneath the superior rectus to be murted on the outer side of the eye-ball, between the superior and the external rectus With a little dissection a delicate synovial membrane can be seen, lubricating the tendon where it passes through the trodden.

This latter is of very variable extent, and between the two heads of origin is a cellular interval, which may extend for some distance up the neck. The muscle is inserted across the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and into the outer half of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. The action of each sterno-niastoid is to twist the head and flex it, so as to throw the chin over the opposite shoulder ; if both muscles act together they draw the head and upper part of the spine forwards, as in rising from a piUow. The stemo-mastoid is supplied by the spinal-accessory nerve and by deep branches of the cervical plexus. Along the posterior border of and beneath the sterno-mastoid will be seen several smaU lymphatic glands (glandules concatenatce). The Deep Cervical Fascia, which has been traced from the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae across the posterior triangle (p. 308), is now seen to cover in the parts included in the anterior triangle, and to extend to the median line ; the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid should be dissected up a little, and turned back to see the continuation of the fascia beneath it. The fascia gives sheaths to all the muscles of the front of the neck, and is continued into the thorax, where it is attached to the pericardium. It forms the sheath of the carotid artery, which is now to be seen beneath the sterno- mastoid.

Its base is above, and is formed by the lower jaw and a line from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; the apex is below, at the top of the sternum. The skin and superficial fascia, the platysma, the deep fascia, and the superficial nerves have been turned aside to expose the contents of the triangle, which are as foUows. The digastric and stylo-hvoid muscles are seen to cut off the submaxillary triangle, in which U lodged the submaxillary gland, resting upon the mylo-hyoid muscle Ween the jaw and the hyoid bone.

The Stemo-clavicular liga- ment (i) may be considered to form a capsule to the joint, or may be divided into an- terior and posterior ligaments. The fibres pass obliquely from the inner extremity of the cla- vicle to the margin of the arti- cular surface of the sternum. Fig. 175. 1. Anteriorsterao-clavicular ligament. 2.

The Cesto-clavicular or Rhomboid ligament (3) is a strong band of fibres of a rliomboidal shape, attached to the upper surface of the cartilage of the first rib, and to the rough impression on the under surface of the inner end of the clavicle, close to the articulation. [It is supposed that the clavicle has been cut close to the attach- ment of the sterno-mastoid in the dissection of the posterior triangle of the neck, but if this has not been the case it should now be divided. The inner end of the clavicle being then drawn up, the costo-clavicular ligament is to be divided, and the knife passed into the sterno-clavicular articulation from below and close to the clavicle. By this, one of the synovial membranes will be opened, and the other can be exposed by cutting from above close to the sternum, thus leaving the inter-articular cartilage uninjured.] The Inter-articular fibro-cartilage (4) is circular and fiat, and is thinner in the centre than at the circumference, being occasionally perforated. It is attached to the clavicle above, and to the sternum and cartilage of the first rib below, and by its circumference to the ligaments of the articulation. A synovial membrane is placed on each side of it. The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial joint admitting of extensive movements of the clavicle in all directions. [The inter-articular fibro-cartilage is to be divided and the inner end of the clavicle dislocated, the fibres of the sterno-hyoid which are attached to it being separated. The sterno-mastoid (with the portion of the clavicle) is then to be turned back, being carefully separated froni the fascia beneath. The spinal-accessory nerve will be found to pierce it at the upper part, and some branches of the cervical plexus enter the under surface of the muscle.] Parts beneath, the Sterno-Mastoid Muscle. By the removal of the sterno-mastoid the following structures will be brought into view, which must be subsequently studied in detail. The posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid, with the posterior auricular artery and parotid gland at the upper border, and the occipital artery at the lower border of the digastric. Lower down are parts of the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulse, and scalenus medius, with the cervical nerves and lymphatic glands. In front, immediately below the digastric, the spinal-accessory nerve will be found, and the hypoglossal nerve arching forward over the carotid vessels.

A small special branch of nerve from the 9th should be traced to this muscle. The Omo-hyoid (Fig. 176, 17) can now be seen in its whole length, crossing the neck beneath the sterno-mastoid and consisting of two bellies nnited by a small tendon, which has been seen to be held down to the clavicle and first rib by a process of the deep cer- vical fascia (v. p. 310). It arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch, and from the transverse ligament which converts the supra-scapular notch into a hole. It is inserted into the body _ot the hyoid bone external to the sternohyoid, and superficial to .he thyro-hyoid muscle. vtm»A These four muscles are direct or indirect depressors of the hyoid bone. They are all supplied by the descender* nam nerve, except the thyro-hyoid, which receives a special branch from the 9th nerve.

On the right side it commences at the sterno-clavicular articulation, by the bifurcation of the innominate into common carotid and subclavian arteries, but on the left side it begins at the arch of the aorta. Its direction in the neck is upwards and a little outwards, and would be sufficiently indicated by a line from the end of the clavicle to the external auditory meatus. It ordinarily divides at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into external and internal carotids, which lie at first side by side, the external being nearer the median line. It has in front of it the sternal origin and anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and the lower parts of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles ; it is crossed by the omo-hyoid muscle and superior thyroid vein, and quite superficially by the platysma ; close upon the vessel throughout are the descendens noni nerve and the sheath, and cross- ing the sheath at the lower part is the middle thyroid vein, and at a variable point the sterno-mastoid artery. Behind the artery are the sheath, the sympathetic cord, and its middle cervical ganglion ; the inferior thyroid artery, and the longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major muscles. To its outer side are the pneumo-gastric nerve and the internal jugular vein ; and to the inner side the trachea, larynx, and thyroid body; the pharynx, oesophagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. The point of bifurcation of the common carotid may vary a little, but is more frequently above than below the thyroid cartilage. Surgery.—To tie the common carotid artery (Fig. 166, e). This may be accomplished either above or below the omo-hyoid, but above the muscle is the better situation. An incision three inches in length along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, beginning at the level of the hyoid bone, will allow that muscle to be turned out- wards sufficiently to bring the omo-hyoid into view. In the an«le between the two muscles the carotid is to be found, and this partTof the operation will be much facilitated by slightly reflecting the omo- hyoid towards the median line (Fig. 164). The descendens noni nerve may be seen on the sheath of the vessels, and is to be avoided, and the sheath is to be carefully onened on its inner side so as to avoid possible injury to the internal jugular332 SIDE OF THE NECK. vein. The needle is to be passed from the outer side, care being taken not to include the pneumo-gastric nerve or the sympathetic. On the dead body the vein is frequently empty, and is liable to be injured unless the sheath be opened well to its inner side. The operation below the omo-hyoid might be performed through a similar incision along the border of the lower part of the sterno- mastoid, but would be facilitated by dividing the sternal origin of the muscle. The sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles would require to he turned inwards, or even divided, in order to reach the vessel. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 180, 2) ascends to the base of the skull, lying close to the pharynx and upon the prevertebral muscles, the vagus, and the sympathetic cord. It is first to the outer side of the external carotid and at the same level, and is crossed by the 9th nerve with the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and the posterior auricular and occipital arteries ; but it crosses the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. Its course is then deeper than the external carotid, from which it is separated by the styloid process with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glossopharyngeal nerve, and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, until it finally enters the carotid canal in the petrous bone. The internal carotid will be more fully traced out in the deep dissection of the neck and pharynx. The External Carotid Artery (Fig. 177) is derived from the common carotid opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and, lying to the inner side of the internal carotid, ascends beneath the sterno-mastoid to a point between the ear and the jaw, where it gives off its terminal branches. It is crossed by two muscles and a nerve (the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles and the 9th nerve), and is separated by the styloid process with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glossopharyngeal nerve from the internal carotid at the upper part, where that vessel lies deeper than it. It is crossed by the lingual and facial veins, and enters the substance of the parotid gland behind the angle of the jaw, where it lies beneath the facial nerve and the commencement of the external jugular vein. ^ Its branches may be divided into three sets, each containing three Anterior set: 1, Superior Thyroid ; 2, Lingual 5< 3 Facial.

The Occipital Artery (Fig. 177, l) is seen only n * It runs backwards .along the inferior border of the dlgastnc, andTHE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 335 may usually be recognised by the fact that the 9th nerve (hypo- glossal) hooks round it. The occipital artery crosses the following important structures, the hypoglossal nerve, internal carotid artery, pneumo-gastric nerve, internal jugular vein, spinal-accessory nerve, and sympathetic trunk. It gives a small posterior meningeal branch to enter the jugular foramen. The Posterior Auricular Artery runs along the upper border of the digastric, and can only be seen by turning that muscle a little down. At the mastoid process it gives the stylo-mastoid branch to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and then supplies the pinna. The Sterno-Mastoid Artery is a small branch of uncertain origin, coming either from the external carotid artery near its commencement, or from the occipital or superior thyroid arteries, or both the latter. It is of smaU size and enters the under surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, crossing the carotid sheath. Veins corresponding to the branches of the external carotid artery take nearly the same courses as those vessels, and terminate as follows : The internal maxillary and temporal veins unite in the parotid to form the temporo-maxillary vein, which afterwards receives the posterior auricular vein. At the angle of the jaw this divides into the External Jugular and the facial communi- cating. The latter joins the facial vein to form the common facial which enters the Internal Jugular. All the other veins open into the Internal Jugular Vein directly, or into an Anterior Jugular if one exists. ° The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 177, 5) is deeply placed to the outer side of the internal carotid artery immediately below the base of the skull being crossed by the styloid process and stylo- pharyngeus muscle, and the spinal accessory nerve, which, however is sometimes beneath the vein. Havirfg been crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoxd and the occipital artery, it is covered by the sterno- mastoid for the rest of its course. It lies to the outefside of Z internal and common carotid arteries, having the pneumo-gastric rLltcT^-1111'^ * enCl0S6d ^idThefthTf cervical iascia. The internal jugular vein receives the facial, Ungual occipital, pharyngeal, superior and middle thyroid veins, and unites with the subclavian vein to form the vena innominata.

The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 178, 5) is seen now in only a small part of its course. It ascends between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles, being crossed by the inferior thyroid artery and on the left side, by the thoracic duct; and enters the foramen m the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra (usually), beino- accompanied by a branch from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The artery passes through the transverse processes of all the upper cervical vertebrae, giving off muscular and spinal branches m its course, and is seen, in the suboccipital region to wind inwards upon the atlas and enter the foramen magnum, to supply the brain. The Vertebral vein has no course in the skull, but commences in small branches about the atlas. It takes the same course as the artery, receiving corresponding branches and also the ascending cervical and deep cervical veins, and after cross- ing the subclavian artery, opens into the termination of the subclavian vein. It often passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. 2.

The Third Part of the Subclavian Artery has been dissected in the posterior triangle of the neck (p. 311). The Subclavian Vein is the continuation of the axillary vein, and has been seen to lie below the level of its artery in the third part of its course. It then passes in front of the scalenus anticus, which muscle separates it from the second portion of the subclavian artery; and lastly lies in front of and a little below the first part of the artery, with the phrenic nerve intervening on both sides of the body, and on the right side the pneumo- gastric nerve also. Each subclavian vein joins the internal jugular vein of the same side to form the innominate vein, and at the point of junction of these two veins the thoracic duct opens on the left side, and the right lymphatic duct on the right side of the body. Branches.—The external and anterior jugular veins open into the subclavian vein outside the scalenus anticus, and the vertebral vein just before it joins the internal jugular. The Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Figs. 179 & 180) (8th pair) is only seen m its cervical portion at present. It is enclosed in the carotid sheath, lying between the jugular vein and the artery, and enters the superior aperture of the thorax, passing, on the right side, between the subclavian artery and the innominate vein, and on the left side between the common carotid and subclavian arteries and behind the innominate vein. m Its Superior Laryngeal branch (14 & 9) curving forwards beneath the internal carotid artery, appears opposite the hyoid bone, and pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane to supply the mucous membrane of the larynx. Before entering the larynx, the nerve gives a small external laryngeal branch, which runs obliquely downwards under the sterno- thyroid muscle to supply the crico-thyroid, one of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (26 & 21) (inferior) is seen running along the side of the trachea between it and the oesophagus, and disappears beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx It takes a different course on the two sides of the body; on the right arising from the pneumo-gastric in the neck and winding round the subclavian artery ; on the left arising in the thorax, and turning round the arch of the aorta. The Cardiac Nerves (17) are one or two slender branches of the pneumo-gastric m the lower part of the neck, running into the thorax to join the cardiac plexuses. 0 eSIDE OF THE NECK. 342 Fig. 180.343 THE SYMPATHETIC. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 179, 9) (9th pair) appears below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, hooking round the occipital artery and then curving forward superficially to the great vessels. It then passes beneath the tendon of the digastric close to the hyoid bone, where it is seen in the angle between the two bellies of the muscle lying upon the hyo-glossus muscle, and finally disappears beneath the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle to supply the muscles of the tongue (Fig. 180, 11). Its descending branch (ramus descendens noni) arises opposite the occipital artery, and runs downward and forward either upon or within the carotid sheath, to supply the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, and to form one or more loops with the communicans noni branch from the cervical plexus (Fig. 177, 7). The nerve to the thyro-hyoid muscle is a very delicate branch derived from the 9th nerve, just before it passes beneath the digastric. The Sympathetic (Figs. 179 & 180) in the neck lies behind the carotid sheath upon the prevertebral muscles. It is a greyish nerve which has three cervical ganglia developed upon it, of which only the upper two can now be seen, the lowest being on the neck of the first rib. The superior cervical ganglion (11 & 16) is a fusiform enlargement of the nerve behind the internal carotid artery, and lying upon the rectus capitis anticus major.

The Spinal-Accessory Nerve (Fig. 179, 5) (8th pair) appears below the digastric and close to the transverse process of the atlas. It pierces the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, giving branches to it, and then emerging, crosses the posterior triangle to the trapezius, which it supplies. The Cervical Plexus (Fig. 177) is formed by the anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves, but the loop from the 1st nerve to the 2nd is of very small size, and cannot be well seen in this stage of the dissection. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nerves appear between the rectus capitis anticus major and the middle scalenus, lying beneath the sterno-mastoid. Each of these nerves communicates with the one above and'below it, and gives off superficial and deep cervical branches. The superficial branches of the cervical plexus have been already dissected in the posterior triangle, and can now be traced to their source,—the great auricular, small occipital, and superficial cervical branches to the 2nd and 3rd nerves, and the descending branches to the 3rd and 4th nerves. The deep branches of the cervical plexus are— 1. Communicating branches with the 8th and 9th cranial nerves and the sympathetic, which will afterwards be dissected. 2. Muscular branches to the rectus capitis anticus major, rectus minor, and rectus lateralis. 3. The Communicans noni (7) usually consisting of two branches from the 2nd and 3rd nerves, which join the descendens noni branch. 4. The Phrenic nerve (11) arising from the 4th nerve (or from the 3rd & 4th) and having in addition a branch of communication with the 5th. It lies upon the scalenus anticus, getting to its inner border at the lower part of the neck, and has a communicating branch from the sympathetic, and also, frequently, from the nerve to the subclavms from the brachial plexus. The phrenic will subse- quently be traced to the diaphragm in the dissection of the thorax. 5. Muscular branches are derived from the plexus, which «o to the sterno-mastoid levator anguli scapula;, and trapezius muscles, and also to the scalenus medius. 'THE FACE. 346 The Face. The face is a region in which it will he convenient to make different dissections on the two sides, i.e., of the muscles and vessels fn one and of the nerves on the other; and the dissectors are there- fore advised to adopt this method of proceeding. Before commencmg the dissection, the student should observ th external anatomy of the eye and its appendages so that they may he seen in as natural a condition as possible (Jng.

The lids being separated, close to the inner canthus will be seen a small space called the lacus lachrymalis, and on the free margin of each Hd close to this will be seen a little eminence (papilla lachrymalis) perforated by a minute hole, the punctum lachrymale (9). A small probe introduced vertically through the punctum will pass hori- zontally along the canaliculus into the lachrymal sac (12), situated in the groove in the lachrymal bone and beneath the tendo oculi. This is a delicate fibrous bag wider above than below, where it is con- tinuous with the nasal duct. It is lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epi- thelium.

The lowest part of the ear is the lobule, which consists of fat. The extrinsic muscles of the ear (Attrahens, Attollens, and Ketra- hens) have been seen in the dissection of the scalp. Various small muscles have been described as passing from one point to another of the cartilage of the pinna, but do not require special description. They can be sufficiently seen in Figs. 183 and 184, and will not repay the trouble of dissection. [The cheeks are now to be distended with cotton wool and the lips carefully sewn together. A little piece of wool may also be intro- duced beneath the eyelids with advantage. An incision is to be made from the temple in front of the ear, along the jaw to the chin (the scalp having been already dissected), and the skin is to be care- ful iy reflected towards the median line. A cut around the orbit and mouth will avoid interference with the eyelids and lips. All muscular fibres and vessels are to be carefully preserved, but the small nerves are to be cut away, together with aU the loose fat The parotid aland in front of the ear is to be preserved, and its duct traced across the face below the malar bone.] Muscles of the Face or Muscles op Expression. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum (Fig. 186, 4) is a broad muscle surrounding the orbit and attached to its inner angle, being continuous above with the fibres of the occipito-frontalis (v. p. 293) It arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, from the tendo ocuh passing between the nasal process of the superior maxilla and the inner extremities of the tarsal cartilages, and from the nasal process itself. Its fibres surround the orbit and are attached to the skin ; those passing on the lids are called the palpebral fibres (or palpebrahs muscle) and are attached externally'to the malar bone and external tarsal ligament. The orbicularis palpebrarum is the muscle which closes the eye- lids and is therefore the direct antagonist of the levator palpebral The Corrugator Supercilii will be seen by removing the portion 0 the orbicular* covering the brow. It arises from the inn™ of the superciliary ridge, and is inserted into the orbicularis about the centre of the eyebrow. uul tlle The Pyramidalis Nasi (Fig. 185, 1) is a small slip 0f mwlp lymg along the nasal bone, continuous with the occipito350 THE FACE.

The Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi (Fig. 186,8) arises from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxilla close to the margin of the orbit; it widens as it descends, and divides into two slips, which are inserted into the alar cartilage of the nose and into the upper lip. The Compressor Naris (Fig. 185, 3) is to be traced beneath the preceding muscle to its origin from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla. The muscle is triangular in shape, and passes to be inserted on the bridge of the nose, where it unites with the opposite muscle and the pyraniidalis nasi. The Depressor Alas Nasi (Fig. 185, 7) is a small muscle which can only be properly seen by everting the lip (at a later stage) and removing the mucous membrane. It arises from the myrti- form fossa over the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, and is inserted into the posterior part of the columna and the ala of the nose.

The Levator Labii Superioris Proprius (Fig. 186, 9) arises from the superior maxilla and margin of the malar bone above the infra-orbital foramen, and is inserted into the npper lip externally to the slip from the common elevator. The Levator Anguli Oris (Fig. 186) arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla immediately below the infra- orbital foramen, and passes downwards and outwards be- neath the preceding muscle to the angle of the mouth, joining the fibres of the orbi- cularis. The Zygomaticus (Fig. 186) is either a single muscle, or has two slips forming the zygomaticus major and minor. The Zygomaticus major (11) arises from the malar bone close to its junction with the zygoma, and passes obliquely to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbi- cularis oris. Fie. 186.

It S" — and as far bach as the and below, it is separated from the ^^J^^3oneTHE FACIAL ARTERY. 353 the styloid process and the deep vessels and nerves of the neck. The duct of Stenson (ductus Stenonis) arises from the anterior part below the socia parotidis, and passes transversely across the masseter, to open into the mouth through the buccinator muscle opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. Immediately below the duct is a large branch of the facial nerve, and above it the transverse facial artery. The gland is traversed by the external carotid artery, which gives off its two terminal branches (temporal and internal maxillary) in its substance; by the external jugular vein ; and by the facial and auriculotemporal nerves, from both of which it receives branches. The structure of the parotid is that of a compound racemose gland, like the other salivary glands. It receives parotid branches from the temporal artery, and its special nervous supply from the auriculo-temporal and sympathetic nerves. [The remains of the platysma are to be removed to show the facial artery and vein m front of the masseter, and the artery is to be fol- lowed out to the inner angle of the eye with as little iniurv to the muscles as possible.] J v m The Facial Artery (Fig. 187) [external carotid], the cervical por- tion of which has been already dissected (p. 334), appears on the face immediately m front of the masseter muscle, where it lies on the lower jaw and is crossed by the platysma. It then passes upwards and in- wards beneath the zygomatic! muscles to the side of the nose bring upon the buccinator, levator anguli oris, and levator labii superioris muscles in its course. At the side of the nose it is crossed by the outer portion of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and reaches the angle of the orbit to anastomose with the nasal branch of the ophthalimc artery.

Surgery.—The facial artery may be compressed or tied immedi- ately m front of the masseter, where its pulsation can be readily felt through the thin platysma. The position of the coronary arteries immediately beneath the mucous membrane should be borne in mind in operating for hare-lip or cancer, as it is necessary to thrust the hare-hp pm deeply into the substance of the lip, in order to control the haemorrhage effectually. The Facial Vein commences at the inner angle of the orbit in the angular vein, formed by the frontal and supra-orbital veins. It then runs obliquely across the face to the edge of .the masseter, where it lies close to the outer side of the artery, and, after receiving the anterior internal maxillary branch from the pterygoid region, passes into the neck to join the internal jugular vein. It is crossed by the zygomatici muscles, but lies upon Stenson's duct. Its branches corre- spond to those of the artery. The Transverse Facial Artery (Fig. 187, 12) arises from the temporal artery m the parotid gland, and appears on the face above the parotid duct, to run transversely inwards towards the nose and anastomose with the facial artery. In a well-injected body the terminations of the infra-orbital and nfiltT arteneS^111 be ^ eme1^ at the -f-orbital and mental foramina, with branches of the 2nd and 3rd divisions of the th nerve.

The structures in the lower lid are the same, minus the levator palpebras. This will be the best opportunity to dissect the Tensor Tarsi Muscle of Horner, by dividing the outer tarsal ligaments and de- taching the eyelids, so as to turn them over the nose and expose their internal surface. By removing the conjunctiva over the tendo oculi, the two little slips of muscular fibre will be seen above and below it. The muscle arises from the ridge on the lachrymal bone, and is in- serted into the tarsal cartilages and canaliculi. Cartilages of the Nose (Figs. 189 and 190).—Only the lateral cartilages and cartilages of the aperture on each side can now be seen, the cartilage of the septum being dissected with the Nose. The lateral cartilage is triangular, its posterior border being continuous with the nasal bone and the nasal process of the maxillary bone, and its anterior border being separated from that of its fellow of the oppo- site side by the edge of the septum. The cartilage of the aperture (alar) is semicircular in shape, and is bent upon itself in front, so as to surround the nostril in front.' It has no attachment to bone, being embedded in the dense cellular tissue of the ala nasi, in which there are frequently two or three little addi- tional nodules, sesamoid cartilages. The cartilages of the two sides adjoin at the tip of the nose, and are attached to the lateral cartilages by fibrous tissue. The Pterygo-Maxillary Kegion.

The piece of bone with the masseter attached ean then be turned down, when the deep fibres of the muscle will be seen attached to the lower jaw, and the masseteric branch of artery and nerve will be found behind the coronoid process, and must neces- sarily be divided. The temporal muscle is to be cleaned and the fat beneath the masseter removed, so as to expose the buccinator muscle thoroughly, together with its branch of nerve and artery, which appear in front of the coronoid process, and are to be preserved.] The Temporal Muscle (Fig. 196, 2) arises from the whole of the temporal fossa and from the under surface of the temporal fascia, which has been seen to be attached to the whole length of the temporal ridge. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the apex of the outer surface of the coronoid process, and into the inner surface of the coronoid process and ramus of the lower jaw, as far as the last molar tooth. It is also connected with the pterygo- maxillary ligament. [With the saw and bone-forceps the coronoid process and the anterior part of the ramus of the jaw are to be carefully cut off, and turned up. The neck of the jaw is then to be sawn through trans- versely just below the condyle, and the ramus divided transversely at the level of the molar teeth. In making this last cut the saw should only go through half the thickness of the jaw, after which the bone-forceps can be applied at the upper border so as to split the piece of bone, and allow of its removal in two pieces without injurv to the nerve. On removing the portion of ramus thus separated, the periosteum will probably be left behind, and on this being dissected away, the inferior dental nerve and artery will be seen lying on the internal lateral ligament before entering the dental foramen, and in front of these the lingual (gustatory) nerve. Crossing both nerves transversely at the upper part of the space now exposed is the external pterygoid muscle, with the internal maxillary artery lying either upon or beneath it. It superficial to the muscle it had better be cleaned, divided, and held aside with a hook.] The External Pterygoid Muscle (Fig. 191, 1) arises by two heads, one from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, and the tuberosity of the palate and maxillary bones ; the other from the under surface of the sphenoid below the pterygoid crest. Its fibres run transversely to be inserted into the hollow on the front of the neck of the jaw, and into the inter-articular fibro-cartilao-e of the joint. 0562 THE, PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.-The external lateral la- ment (Fig 192, 5) is a short thick hand of fibres broader above than Passes obliquely downwards and backwards from the lower border of the root of the zygoma to the neck of the jaw. It is continuous with the capsular ligament, which is attached to the matins of the articular Surfaces, and is sometimes described as con- Fig. 191. Fig. 192. dating of anterior, posterior, and internal portions. By dividing the ligaments, the inter-articnlar cartilage and the synovial membranes above and below it will be brought into view. The inter-articular fibre-cartilage (Fig. 193, 3) is seen to fit into the glenoid cavity, and its upper surface is accordingly concavo-convex from before backwards, the lower surface being concave. the cartilage, together with the condyle, being detached from the temporal bone and turned forward with the external pterygoid muscle, will be found to be oval in outline and thicker at the margins than in the centre, which is occasionally perforated.

It arises from the internal surface of the external pterygoid plate, and from the tuberosity of the palate Fig. 193. Fig. 194. bone and superior maxilla, and is inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw, its fibres running parallel to the superficial portion of the masseter. In many subjects a portion of the internal pterygoid arises from the outer surface of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, anterior to the fibres of the pterygoideus externus (Fig. 196). The Buccinator (Fig. 196, 14) forms the greater part of the cheek, and has been partly seen in the dissection of the face. It arises from the alveolar border of the superior maxilla opposite the molar teeth ; from a corresponding portion of the inferior maxilla ; and between the jaws from the anterior border of the pterygo-maxillary ligament.

The muscle is inserted into the angle of the mouth, joining the orbi- cularis oris, and its middle fibres decussate with one another as they pass to their insertion. The buccinator is perforated by the duct of the parotid gland opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The Pterygo-Maxillary Ligament (Fig. 197) is a white fibrous band extending between the internal pterygoid plate and the lower jaw, close to the last molar tooth. By its anterior border it gives attachment to the buccinator, and by its posterior border to the superior constrictor of the pharynx ; it thus establishes the connec- tion between the cavities of the mouth and the pharynx, the mucous membrane covering its inner surface. The temporal, masseter, external and internal pterygoids, and buc- cinator are classed together as the Muscles of Mastication. The temporal, masseter, and internal pterygoid muscles close the jaws, but the masseter and internal pterygoid draw the lower jaw forward, whilst the temporal draws it back, thus producing the anteropos- terior movement. The lateral movements of the jaw are produced by the alternate action of the two external pterygoid muscles, which, if acting together, protrude the chin. The principal action of the buccinator is to keep the food between the teeth during mastication, but it also expels air from the mouth (and hence the name "trumpeter"), as is well seen m using the blowpipe. The muscles of mastication are all supplied by the motor portion of the third division of the 5th nerve, but the buccinator is also, and principally, supplied by the facial nerve (7th) ; as is shown by the fact that in paralysis of that nerve the buccinator fails m its action, and food collects between the teeth and the cheek. The Internal Maxillary Artery (Fig. 195) is seen m this dissection in its first and second portions, the third being m the sphenomaxillary fossa. One of the terminal branches of ^ external carotid artery, it arises in the parotid gland immediately behind tlie neck of the jaw. The First Part of the internal maxillary artery, with its accom- panying veins, lies, between the neck of the jaw and tlie interna LLl ligament. It gives off a descending branch, the Infenor dented, and an ascending branch, the Middle meningeal a. The Inferior dental artery (u) descends on the internal lateral ligament to the inferior dental foramen, by which it enters ^ lower jaw ; it then runs in a canal in the substance of that bone supplying the posterior teeth, and, after giving an vncisor branch toTHE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 365 the front teeth, appears on the face at the mental foramen with the third division of the 5th nerve. Immediately before entering the dental foramen it gives off the mylo-hyoid branch, which pierces the Fig. 195. internal lateral ligament with a nerve of the same name, and runs in a groove on the internal surface of the lower jaw to the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoid and to the digastric muscle, joining the submental artery. b.

It passes between the roots of the auriculotemporal nerve to the foramen spinosum, by which it enters the skull. Before doing so, it gives off the meningeaparva to enter the foramen ovale, and a tympanic branch to enter the Glasserian fissure. The Second Part of the internal maxillary artery varies in position in different subjects. It is always intermuscular, but it may He between the temporal and external pterygoid, or between the external and internal pterygoid muscles. If it lies superficially to the external pterygoid muscle, it passes between its two heads to reach the pterygo-maxillary fossa. Its branches are all muscular ie to the muscles of mastication. There are two deep temporal branches (anterior (2) and posterior (3)) running in the substance of the temporal muscle; a masseteric branch (15) of small size passing through the si-moid notch to the under surface of the muscle (now neces- sarily divided); two pterygoid branches, uncertain in origin and course ; and a buccal branch (10) which generally pierces the external pterygoid muscle to accompany the nerve to the surface of the buccinator. . , , The Posterior dental artery (6), one of the branches of the third part of the internal maxillary artery, can be seen entering one of the fora- mina on the posterior surface of the superior maxilla, in which it ramifies, supplying that bone and the molar teeth. _ The Internal Maxillary Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, and between the muscles forms the pterygoid plexus, which communicates with the facial vein by the anterior internal maxillary vein. It enters the parotid gland, to join the temporal vein and form the external jugular. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve (Figs. 196 and 197) (3rd division of 5th) as soon as it emerges from the foramen ovale divides into a motor and a sensory portion, the latter, however, having a few motor fibres mingled with it. The Motor Portion (Fig. 196) with which there are also sensory fibres, is of small size, is placed externally to the sensory portion, and is distributed to the muscles of mastication, running with the cor- responding branches of the internal maxillary artery. Its branches are! anterior and posterior temporal (2 & 3), masseteric (i5),.pW* and buccal (10), and are difficult to find, except the last, which is ot good size, and may be traced to the surface of the peculator where it communicates with the facial nerve, which has probably most to do with the supply to that muscle. . ,or_ai The Sensory Portion (Fig. 197) gives off abranch to the internalTHE LINGUAL NERVE. 367 pterygoid which is connected with the otic ganglion, and'divides close to the base of the skull into three trunks, the Lingual Nerve (or gus- tatory) the most anterior ; the Inferior Dental Nerve (which has some motor fibres) in the middle ; and the Auriculo-Temporal Nerve most posterior and smallest.

Beneath the external pterygoid the nerve is joined at an acute angle "by the small chorda tympani nerve (7), a branch of the facial nerve in the temporal bone, which passes through the tym- panum between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, and emerges through the canal of Huguier at the inner side of the Glasserian fissure, to which it should now be traced. The Inferior Dental Nerve (Fig. 197, 18) has a branch of com- munication with the lingual trunk, and then descends upon the I pterygoideus interims, and afterwards upon the internal lateral -ligament, to the dental foramen. After entering the bone it -supplies all the teeth of the lower jaw, either directly or by its incisor branch (22), and emerges at the mental foramen with its accompanying artery. Immediately before entering the dental foramen it gives off the mylo-hyoid nerve (17), which pierces the internal lateral ligament with the accompanying artery, and, after running in a groove on the inner surface of the bone, is distributed on the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, and also supplies the anterior belly of the digastric. The Auriculotemporal Nerve (Fig. 197, 9) passes horizontally backwards behind the teraporo-niaxillary articulation, and often ias two roots of origin which embrace the middle meningeal artery. It then turns upwards in front of the ear through the parotid gland and is distributed on the temple (v. p. 294). It gives branches to the ear (auricular), to the parotid (of which it is the excitory nerve ac- cording to Bernard), and to the joint; and communicates with the Bacial nerve and with the sympathetic.

It is inserted into the side of the tongue, where its fibres decussate with those of the stylo-glossus. It is sometimes' described as consisting of three separate portions—basio-glossus, kerato-glossus, and chondro-glossus. The hyo-glossus draws the sides of the tongue downward. It is supplied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-Glossus (Fig. 199, 9) arises from near the tip of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and passing obliquely forwards and downwards, reaches the side of the tongue, into which it is inserted, decussating with the hyo-glossus and joining the fibres of the lingualis. The stylo-glossus raises the margins of the tongue and draws it upwards and backwards, and therefore back into the mouth when it has been protruded, thus assisting the anterior fibres of the genio- hyo-glossus. It is sillied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-Pharyng-eus (Fig. 199, 11) arises from the root of the styloid process on its inner side, and passes downward to disappear between the upper and middle constrictors of the pharynx opposite the hyoid bone. Its insertion will be seen in the dissection of the pharynx.* The stylo-pharyngeus is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve, which winds round its posterior border. [The hyo-glossus is to be divided near the hyoid bone to expose the lingual artery, the branches of which are to be cleaned. The tongue being put on the stretch, all remains of mucous membrane covering the genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossus muscles are to be- removed and the muscles cleaned.] The Lingual Artery (Fig. 200) has been seen for a short distance m the anterior triangle, viz. from its origin from the external carotid, until crossed by the hyo-glossus. It was crossed by the hyo-glossus digastric, and stylo-hyoid muscles, and by the hypoglossal nerve' and is now seen to lie against the origin of the middle constrictor of the pharynx immediately above the hyoid bone, and thenlo pass on to the genio-hyo-glossus, by which it is conducted to the tip of the tongue.

Surgery —The lingual artery can be most conveniently tied 111 the triable formed by the two bellies of the digastric and the hypo- crlossal nerve, by dividing the fibres, of the hyo-glossus horizontally near the hyoid bone. A curved incision from the symphysis menti to near the angle of the jaw, reaching to the level of .the hyoid bone will expose the lower border of the submaxillary gland, which must be drawn upwards so as to expose the digastric muscle.

The author has on two occasions tied the lingual artery without difficulty by this method, which is much more satisfactory than attempting to find the vessel opposite the great cornu of the hyoid bone, to which its relation is uncertain. The Lingual Vein has branches corresponding to those of the artery, and passes beneath the hyo-glossus to open into the internal jugular vein. Not unfrequently, however, a large vein lies super- ficially to the hyo-glossus, in addition to a smaller vein accompanying the artery. The Genio-hyoid muscle (Fig. 200, 6) arises from the lower of the two genial (or mental) tubercles close to the symphysis menti, and passes downwards immediately beneath the mylo-hyoid and close to the median line, to be inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. The Genio-hyo-glossus muscle (Fig. 200, 4) arises from the upper of the genial tubercles, and is triangular or fan-shaped, being inserted close to the median line all along the under surface of the tongue, and to the body of the hyoid bone above the genio- hyoid. The genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossus are elevators of the hyoid bone or depressors of the jaw, as they alternately take their fixed point above or below. The genio-hyo-glossus has an important action on the tongue, the posterior and middle fibres drawing up the hyoid bone and thrusting the tongue out of the mouth (and to the opposite side if acting singly), and the anterior fibres drawing the tongue into the mouth again, being assisted by the stylo-glossus. .Both the genio-hyoid and the genio-hyo-glossus are supplied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-maxillary Ligament (Fig. 194, 6) will be seen attached to the angle of the jaw, which is turned up. It is a process of deep cervical fascia attached to the apex of the styloid process (where it gives origin to fibres of the stylo-glossus), and inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the jaw, where it is much gknds mtervenes between the parotid and submaxillary The Stylo-hyoid Ligament is a narrowband passing from the styloid process to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, where it The Inferior Palatine and Tonsillitic branches of the }mMDEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. 376 artery can be seen ascending, the former between the styloglossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the latter either with it or between the stylo-glossus and pterygoideus interims, to the outside of the pharynx, where they lie upon the superior constrictor. They will be more fully seen in the dissection of the pharynx. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 198, n) (8th) is seen emerging from between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and winding round the stylo-pharyngeus muscle ; if the stylo- glossus be now divided, the nerve may be followed beneath that muscle to the base of the tongue, where it supplies the papilla drcumvallatas. It gives branches to the stylo-pharyngeus and to the pharynx in this part of its course, and will be again seen in another dissection. Deep Dissection op the Side of the Neck. On one side only of the subject it will be useful to make a deep dissection, bringing into view, from the side, parts which will be afterwards seen from behind in the dissection of the pharynx'. [Divide the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and cut through the inferior dental and lingual nerves and reflect them carefully upwards. The branch to the internal pterygoid muscle from the deep surface of the inferior maxillary nerve can now be traced to the posterior border of the muscle, and m close connec- tion with it may possibly be found a small pink body, the otic ganglion.] The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 201) is a minute body which receives its motor root from the internal pterygoid nerve of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth. Its sensory root may be traced from the'auriculotemporal nerve, where it embraces the middle meningeal artery and a second sensory root is derived from the tympanic branch of thecdosso-pharyngeal (Jacobson's nerve) through the small super- ficial petrosal nerve of Arnold, connected with the facial trunk. The sympathetic root also enters the ganglion behind, coming from that upon the middle meningeal artery. A branch passes from the ganglion forwards and downwards to the tensor pHati muscle, and another backwards to the tensor tympani. [The internal pterygoid muscle is to be from its attachment to the inner surface of the efel™ ^Xte plate. The tensor palati lying upon the internal will now be exposed, and posterior to it the superior constuctorTHE SUPERIOR CONSTRICTOR. 377 of the pharynx with the ascending pharyngeal artery lying upon it.] The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery (Fig. 203, 9) can now be traced from the external carotid artery near its origin, and lies between the internal carotid and the pharynx. It gives branches to the prever- tebral muscles, anastomosing with the ascending cervical artery, and near the base of the skull divides into pharyngeal and meningeal branches. The meningeal branches are very small and enter the skull by the foramen lacerum medium and the foramen jugulare, to supply the dura mater. The pharyngeal branches supply the pharynx, and turn over the upper border of the superior constrictor to supply the palate. A palatine branch also accompanies the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. The Tensor Palati (Fig. 207, 6) is now seen in part, and will be more fully exposed by cutting away the external pterygoid plate with bone-forceps. Its vertical fibres covering the internal pterygoid plate arise from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal plate, and slightly from the under surface of the wing of the sphenoid and the outer surface of the Eustachian tube. The tendon winds round the hamular process to its insertion into the palate ; but this is obscured at present by the attachment of the fibres of the superior constrictor to the internal pterygoid plate. The Superior Constrictor of the Pharynx (Fig. 201, 1) is now seen arising from the lower third of the internal pterygoid'plate, and from the hamular process of the sphenoid bone ; from the pterygo- maxillary ligament opposite the attachment of the buccinator ; from the inner surface of the lower jaw above the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and slightly from the side of the tongue. The fibres curve backwards, leaving an interval between the muscle and the base of the skull in which the fibrous bag of the pharynx is visible, to be inserted in the median raphe. [In order to complete a side-view of the Internal Carotid, Ju<mlar Vein, and Eighth nerve it will be necessary to remove the rem W oi the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and the ektern^cS^d artery, cutting it above the origin of the ^r^)„ u carot]d Wch.

The Stylo-hyoid Ligament lies between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and gives origin to some fibres of the middle constrictor of the pharynx. It is attached above to the tip of the styloid process, and below to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. [The styloid process is to be cut through at its base and turned aside with the stylo-pharyngeus, when the careful removal of a process of fascia will expose the internal carotid, the jugular vein, and the eighth pair up to the base of the skull; with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves, and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic] The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 201) commences at the point of bifurcation of the common carotid, usually opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It is at first to the outer side of the external carotid, and, like it, is covered by the sterno-mastoid and platysma muscles, and crossed by the hypoglossal nerve with the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. It then lies behind the ex- ternal carotid, and is crossed by the styloid process and the stylo- pharyngeus muscle, with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and pharyn- geal branch of the vagus. Posteriorly it rests against the sympathetic trunk and the rectus capitis anticus major, and is crossed by the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. The pneumo- gastric nerve and internal jugular vein lie to its outer side in the whole of its course, and to the inner side is the pharynx with the ascending pharyngeal artery. The artery enters the carotid canal of the temporal bone, in which it will be subsequently traced. The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 201) commences outside the skull by the junction of the lateral with the inferior petrosal sinus, and lies to the outer side of the internal and common carotids in the neck, with the eighth and ninth nerves intervening, and in front of the rectus capitis lateralis. It receives no branch above the hyoid bone, but below that level it receives the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital, pharyngeal and middle thyroid veins, and joins the subclavian vein to form the innominate or brachio-cephalic vein (p. 335). The Pneumo-gastric Nerve or Vagus (Fig. 201, 4) leaves the skull at the foramen jugulare in front of the vein, and in the same sheath as the spinal-accessory nerve. It follows the carotid artery380 DEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. lying between it and the jugular vein, and close to the skull is joined lay the accessory portion of the spinal-accessory nerve,, and expands to form the ganglion of the trunk, from which the two following, branches can now be traced. The pharyngeal branch (Fig. 180, 3,) receives a branch from the spinal-accessory nerve and then passes in front of (or behind) the internal carotid artery to the pharynx, where it joins the pharyngeal plexus (p. 388). The superior laryngeal nerve (Fig. 180, 9) takes an oblique course behind the internal carotid to the thyro-hyoid membrane. The cranial branches of the pneumo-gastric will be subsequently described (p. 386). . , The Spinal-accessory Nerve (Fig. 201, 10) leaves the jugular foramen in the sheath of the pneumo-gastric nerve, with which it has communicating branches. It gives branches, by means of the accessory part which joins the vagus in the jugular foramen, to jom the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus, lie principal or spinal part passes over or under the internal jugular vein, and pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle to end in the trapezius. _ The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 201, 6) emerging at the anterior condyloid foramen, conies forward between the pneumo-gastric and spinal-accessory nerves, and crosses the external carotid artery. It has branches of communication with the pneumo-gastric and sym- pathetic, and also with the first spinal nerve. Its distribution to the muscles of the tongue has been already seen (p. 372). The Bectus Capitis Lateralis (Fig. 202, 8) is now seen from the side between the jugular vein and the vertebral artery. It wyes Irom the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. mv carefully removing the rectus lateralis, the small anterior branch of tS first cervical nerve may be found upon the anterior arch of the atlas, forming a loop with the second nerve.] The First Cervical Nerve (sub-occipital nerve) (Fig. 201) has a small anterior division, which leaves the posterior division on the ;0XL arch of the atlas.

It will be much more satisfactorily examined later on, from behind. Prevertebral Eegion. ' [The carotid arteries, with the jugular veins and the pneunio-gastric and sympathetic nerves, are to be divided at the level of the top of the sternum, and the trachea with the oesophagus is to be severed a little lower down. The neck is then to be bent forcibly backward so as to make the cut surface of the skull rest upon the table, and the oesophagus and trachea with the vessels and nerves being drawn forcibly forward, the cellular tissue between the pharynx and the front of the vertebral column is to be cautiously dissected through, until the under surface of the base of the skull is exposed. The saw is now to be applied close behind the mastoid process, and an oblique cut made, which is to be carried through the whole thickness of the temporal bone into the jugular foramen, and prolonged through the remaining portion of the parietal bone to the cut which wras made in removing the brain. A similar cut having been made on the oppo- site side, a broad chisel is to be applied to the basilar process of the occipital bone where it is exposed behind the pharynx, and it is to be divided. The chisel being again applied on each side of the middle line will unite this cut with those made by the saw, and the prepara- tion will then be divided into two parts ; the anterior part of the skull with the pharynx and deep vessels and nerves is to be wrapped up for subsequent examination, and the muscles attached to the vertebral column with the posterior part of the skull are now to be examined.] The Scalene muscles have been seen already in part, but can now be fully dissected. The Scalenus Anticus (Fig. 202, i) arises from the tubercle on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib (scalene tubercle), and ascends to be inserted into the anterior tubercles on the trans- verse processes of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebra. The phrenic nerve will probably still be found on the anterior surface of the muscle, and behind it the brachial nerves emerge and the sub- clavian artery passes. The Scalenus Medius (Fig. 202, 7) lies behind the brachial nerves, arising from the rough marking upon the upper surface of the first rib behind the groove for the subclavian artery. It ascends to be inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebra?. The Scalenus Posticus (Fig. 202), which is the smallest of the three muscles, arises from a rough mark on the outer surface of theTHE PREVERTEBRAL REGION. 382 Pig. 202. second rib, posterior to the attachment of the serratus magnus ; and is inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lowest three cervical vertebrae. _ The Rectus Capitis Anticus Major (Fig. 202, i) arises from the anterior tubercles on'the transverse processes of the 3rd 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebras (thus corresponding to the insertion of the scalenus anticus), and is in- serted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone close to the median line. The in- sertions of this and the following muscles are very generally damaged by the division of the base of the skull. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig. 202, 4) is beneath the preceding muscle, which must be turned aside to show it, It arises from the front of the lateral mass of the atlas, and partly from its transverse process, and ascends obliquely inwards to be inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, posterior to and further from the median line than the rectus major.

The inferior oblique 'portion (3) arises from the bodies of the 1st and 2nd dorsal vertebrae, and passes obliquely upward to be inserted into the transverse processes of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebra?. The superior oblique portion (5) arises from the anterior tnbercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical vertebrae, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the anterior tubercle of the atlas. ' The vertical portion (6) arises from the bodies of the three lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the bodies of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cervical vertebrae. All the prevertebral muscles draw forward the upper part of the vertebral column or bow the head, when acting symmetrically ; ot when the muscle of one side acts alone, it draws the spine to that side. The scalene muscles, when the vertebrae are fixed, act upon the ribs and raise them, thus being ordinary muscles of inspiration. The scaleni and longus colli are supplied by branches derived from the nerves of the brachial plexus, close to the intervertebral foramina. The recti antici are supplied by the anterior branches of the first and second cervical, and the rectus lateralis by the anterior branch of the first cervical nerve. The small Intertransverse muscles may be seen between the trans- verse processes. The anterior ones pass between the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes, and the posterior ones have been already seen in the dissection of the back. Between them the anterior divisions of the cervical nerves appear. The Vertebral Artery will be seen between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli muscles, and may be more conveniently traced through the foramina in the transverse processes now than at an earlier period (v. p. 337). Dissection of the Pharynx. Before dissecting the anterior half of the skull with the pharynx the dissector should examine the fauces and upper part of the pharynx from the mouth. The soft palate with the uvula in the median line will be readily recognised, and passing from the soft palate on each side will be seen the two pillars of the fauces with the tonsil between them. The anterior pillar extends from the soft palate to the tongue being vertical in direction, and formed by the palato-glossus muscle* The posterior pillar passes obliquely backwards, and is lost in the pharynx, being formed by the palato-pharyngeus muscle. The tonsil384 ' THE PHARYNX. is generally much shrunken in a subject which has arrived at this stage of dissection. The vessels and nerves now to be examined have all ^en seen in part in previous dissections, and then from either the front or the lile They are now all seen from behind, and this must be borne m niind thoroughly, or it will lead to misconception of the description. ?he section of t ie base of the skull is seldom precisely simdar on 2 two sides, and it will generally be found advisable totaeto trace the parts first brought into view on one side and the caiotid artery etc., on the other, as in the illustration (* ig. 203). The Sympathetic Nerve (Fig. 203) with its superior and middl cereal ganglia is at once exposed, and some of its branches may be ^^e^„Uon (I2) is fusiform, and nearly an inch in length.

The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 203, 8) commences outside the skull by.the junction of the lateral sinus with the inferior petrosal sinus. Its course in the neck has been already seen, and it should now be divided close to the skull and removed. The Spinal-accessory Nerve (Fig. 203, 6) emerges from the .Fig. 203. foramen jugulare, where it is closely connected with the pneumo-- gastric nerve, and may be traced to the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid muscle (Fig.. 204. 4).

Fis. 204. Two ganglia are found upon the pneumo-gastric nerve, viz., the superior or ganglion of the root, and the inferior or ganglion of the trunk. The ganglion of the root is very small, and is placed in the jugular foramen. It has minute branches of commu- nication with the glosso- pharyngeal, spinal-accessory, sympathetic, and facial nerves. The communication with the latter is through a minute auricular branch, which enters a hole within the jugular fossa, and passes through the temporal bone to the pinna (Fig. 204, 17). The ganglion of the trunk is nearly an inch long, and of a pink colour, and has branches of communication with the hypoglossal, the sympathetic, and the loop of the first and second cervical nerves. It gives off the following branches :— 1. The pharyngeal branch oj the pieuvw-gastric (14)5 which receives a communicating branch from the spinal-acces- sory nerve, and then passes in front of (or sometimes l^oI-Diagx-am of the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves (from xig. ^t. 6 Hirschfeld and Leveille). 3.

The superior laryngeal nerve (16), which takes an oblique course behind the internal carotid to the larynx, where it has been already seen to give off the external. laryngeal branch, and then to pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane (Fig. 204, 22). The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 203, 2) lies in a little special notch in the lower border of the petrous bone as it leaves the jugular foramen, being thus isolated from the remainder of the eighth nerve. It then passes forward over the internal carotid artery, and reaches the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, at the lower border of which'it has already been seen in the submaxillary region, and has been traced to the tongue (p. 376). It presents two small ganglia, one at the upper part of the foramen, the superior or jugular ganglion, which is of very small size, and the other at the lower part of the foramen, which is larger, and is called the inferior or petrous ganglion or ganglion of Andersch (Fig. 204, 2). The upper ganglion involves only some of the fibres of the nerve, but they all pass through the lower ganglion. The lower ganglion has branches of communication with the pneumo-gastric nerve, one going to its superior ganglion, and another to the auricular nerve ; also with the superior ganglion of the sym- pathetic ; and with the facial nerve by a branch which pierces the posterior belly of the digastric (Fig. 204, 25). The glosso-pharyngeal nerve gives off the following branches in its course to the tongue :— 1.

The carotid takes a tortuous course in the temporal bone and eranium, making two sigmoid turns, one, the longer, in the petrous bone, and the other by the side of the sella turcica. In this part of its course it is more or less surrounded by a plexus of nerves derived principally from the sympathetic. The Ascending- Pharyngeal Artery (Fig. 203, 9) is one of the ascending branches of the external carotid artery. It arises near the bifurcation of the common carotid, and ascends by the side of the pharynx, and to the inner side of the internal carotid artery, to the base of the skull. It gives branches to the prevertebral muscles, anastomosing with the ascending cervical artery, and divides into meningeal and pharyngeal branches. The meningeal tranches are very small, and enter the skull by the foramen lacerum medium and the foramen jugulare, to supply the dura mater. The pharijngeal branches supply the pharynx, and turn over the upper border of the superior constrictor to supply the palate; they anastomose with the inferior palatine branch of the facial artery. The ascending pharyngeal vein opens into the internal jugular. [The constrictor muscles of the pharynx are to be cleaned in the •direction of their fibres, beginning at the lower border of the inferior constrictor. In order to see the origin of the superior constrictor, it will be necessary to remove the internal pterygoid on one side. The pharyngeal plexus must necessarily be destroyed in the course of the dissection, but the superior and inferior laryngeal, and the glosso- pharyngeal nerves are to be preserved.] The Inferior Constrictor (Fig. 205, 9) is the most superficial of the three muscles of the pharynx, the upper oblique border over- lapping the middle constrictor, and the lower straight border being continuous with the oesophagus. It arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage in front of the articular facet, and from the ala of the thyroid cartilage behind the oblique line. All the fibres are inserted into the median raphe. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor, and the superior laryngeal nerve and artery intervene between it and the middle constrictor. The Middle Constrictor (Fig. 205, 10) is a fan-shaped muscle, which with its fellow of the opposite side forms a trapezium in the median line. It arises from the upper surface of the greatfcornu of the hyoid bone, from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid liga-THE PHARYNX. 890 Kg. menf and its fibres ascend and descend obliquely to be ftyrti into ^t!^^ b, tbe J*£ — and itself coTCIs tbe enperio, —^ 205. superior laryngeal nerve and vessels, and from the superior constrictor the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glossopharyngeal nerve. The Superior Constrictor (Fig, 205, n) arises from the lower third of the internal pterygoid plate and from the hamular process of the sphenoid hone ; from the pterygo- maxillary ligament opposite the at- tachment of the huccinator ; ironi the inner surface of the lower jaw ahove the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and slightly from the side of the tongue.

The three constrictors are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus of nerves ; the superior has also branches from the glossopharyngeal, and the inferior from the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The Stylo-Pharyngeus Muscle (Fig. 205, 12) has already been seen at its origin, and can now be followed to its insertion by dividing some of the fibres of the middle constrictor. It arises from the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and passes between the superior and middle constrictors to be inserted into the bag of the pharynx, and into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. It is supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Fibrous lag of the Pharynx is very thin at the lower part, where it lies between the muscular fibres and the mucous membrane, but above the border of the superior constrictor it is much stronger, and is expanded from side to side, covering in the Eustachian tubes and the levatores palati muscles. At the base of the skull it is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone, by a fibrous band (cranio- pharyngeal ligament, Quain), to the Eustachian tube, and to the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and is carried forwards to the root of the pterygoid process and the internal ptery- goid plate of the sphenoid bone, becoming continuous with the pterygo- m axillary ligament. [The pharynx is to be opened from behind by an incision in the median line, from the basilar process to the commencement of the oesophagus. The fibrous bag is to be detached from the occipital bone on each side and held widely open with hooks, and the whole of the cotton wool is to be removed from the interior of the pharynx.] The Interior of the Pharynx (Fig. 206) presents seven openings in the following order from above downwards; (1 and 2) the two posterior nares separated by the vomer; (3 and 4) the two Eusta- chian tubes ; (5) the isthmus faucium or opening of the mouth ; (6) the superior aperture of the larynx guarded by the epiglottis; and (7) the opening into the oesophagus. The soft palate or velum pendulum palati (5) intervenes between the nose and the mouth, and consists of a fibrous membrane which is attached to the palate bones, and is strengthened by expansions from the several muscles of the palate ; it is covered by mucous mem- brane, which is ciliated on the upper but not on the lower surface. The centre of its free border is prolonged into the uvula, and on each side will be seen the two folds called the pillars of the fauces, formed by mucous membrane reflected upon the palato-glossi and palato- pharyngei muscles. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with both392 THE PHARYNX. that of the nose and of the mouth, and its epithelium varies m different situations, being squamous throughout the canal below the level of the palate, but columnar and ciliated above that point. Close to the base of the skull is a collection of follicular glands, extending from one Eustachian tube to the other, and forming the pharyngeal tonsils of Kolliker. These are hypertrophied in cases of congenital cleft-palate, when they can be readily seen, and appear to assist in closing the aperture between the nose and mouth during deglutition. This is the best opportunity for study- ing the Process of Deglutition. The food having been duly masticated and insalivated, the mouth is closed in order that the lower jaw may afford a fixed point from which the muscles of the tongue may act. The bolus of food is then carried back to the fauces by the movement of the tongue, and is there grasped by the pillars of the fauces and prevented from returning. The pharynx is now raised by the stylo-pharyngei muscles and is at the same time widened to receive the food, which is prevented from ascending into the nares by the raising and tension of the soft palate, due to the action of the levator and circumflexus palati of both sides, and by the approximation of the posterior pillars by means of the contraction ot the palato-pharyngei. The constrictors, by their successive contraction from above, downwards, next force the food towards the oesophagus. At the same moment the larynx is raised by the action of the eleva- tors of the hyoid bone, and the aperture of the larynx is compressed against the epiglottis and base of the tongue; by which means the food is prevented from entering the windpipe. An additional security is provided by the epiglottis, which when healthy is folded down over Pig. 206.-Pharynx laid open from behind (from Wilson) 1. Section of base of skull. 2, 2.

Lastly the contraction of the oesophagus carries the food down to the stomach. The Palate. [The soft palate is to be stretched by inserting a hook into the uvula, and the mucous membrane is to, be removed from the upper surface of the palate and the neighbouring bones, so as to expose the muscles above the palate and the Eustachian tube. The levator palati will be found passing obliquely inwards, the azygos uvulee in the median line of the palate, and the tensor palati can be best seen by dividing the levator and detaching the fibres of the superior con- strictor from the hamular process, when the muscle will be found upon the internal pterygoid plate.] The Soft Palate (velum pendulum palati) is a musculo-membra- nous curtain attached to the posterior border of the hard palate in front, and with a free border behind terminating in the uvula. It consists of an aponeurosis attached to the palate bones, overlaid by expansions from the palatine muscles, and covered on both surfaces with mucous membrane, which on the oral surface presents a thick layer of mucous glands. From behind forwards the soft palate con- sists of 1. Pharyngeal mucous membrane; 2. Thin attachment of palato-pharyngeus; 3. Azygos uvulae ; 4. Levator palati; 5. Thicker attachment of palato-pharyngeus ; 6. Tendon of tensor palati; 7. Fibrous aponeurosis ; 8. Palato-glossus ; 9. Oral mucous membrane with mucous glands. The Azygos Uvulae (Fig. 207, 8) consists of two small muscular slips placed parallel to, and on each side of, the median line. It arises from the posterior nasal spine of the palate bone, and is inserted into the uvula. The Levator Palati (Fig. 207, 5) arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the under surface of the Eustachian tube. The muscle passes inwards above the border of the superior constrictor muscle, and is inserted into the soft palate by a broad expansion, which meets that of its fellow muscle in the median line. The Circumflexus or Tensor Palati (Fig. 207, 6) arises from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, and slightly from the under surface of the wing of the sphenoid; also from the outer surface of the Eustachian tube. The tendon descends verti- cally to wind round the hamular process of the sphenoid bone, where394 THE PALATE. it is lubricated by a minute bursa, and then takes a horizontal direc- tion to the soft palate. It is inserted into the palate by an expansion beneath the levator, and also into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the palate bone. Fig. 207. The levator palati raises the soft palate, and the circuniflexus makes- it tense on each occasion of swallowing. The azygos uvula, can have but a slight and unimportant action, viz., that of shortening the uvula. The levator palati and azygos uvulae are supplied by palatine branches from the sphenopalatine (Meckel's) ganglion; the tensor palati receives a branch from the otic ganglion. m Sureerv -The muscles above the palate, and especially the levatoi palati, are of interest surgically in relation to the operation of staphyloraphy, or that for closure of a congenital fissure of the Fig. 207—Muscles of the palute Q 1.

Sir W. Fergusson showed that the two segments of a fissured soft palate are drawn asunder by the levatores palati on every occa- sion of swallowing, and he therefore proposed and carried out the division of these muscles, by means of a knife having a lancet-shaped blade set at right angles to the handle, which is passed through the fissure. Opportunity is to be taken, before the pillars of the fauces are- dissected, to observe the important surgical fact that a bistoury, if made to transfix the tonsil from before backwards, will pass internally to the carotid artery, unless the point of the instrument is directed purposely to one side, in which case only would it be possible to injure this important vessel. The Eustachian Tube (Fig. 207, 2) is the communication be- tween the pharynx and the tympanum or middle ear. The osseous portion of the canal is in the temporal bone, but the cartilaginous portion is now seen to be nearly, an inch in length, and to ter- minate in a broad trumpet-shaped end at the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinate bone. The cartilage of which the tube is formed is triangular in shape and is doubled upon itself, the defi- ciency at the lower part being completed by fibrous tissue. In the recent condition the thick mucous membrane converts the opening into a mere vertical slit, which is generally closed, but during the process of deglutition is opened by the action of the circumflexus- palati muscle, and thus the equilibrium of the air in the tympanum is maintained. [The palate is to be drawn up so as to put the pillars of the fauces on the stretch as much as possible, and the mucous membrane is to- be removed to expose the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus muscles.] The Palato-glossus is placed in front of the tonsil, and is very small and indistinct. The muscle arises from the middle line of the soft palate in common with its fellow, and descends to the side of the tongue, where it is inserted, joining the fibres of the stylo-glossus and hyo-glossus muscles. The Palato-pharyngeus (Fig. 207, 9) is larger than the palato- glossus, and is placed behind the tonsil. I*t arises in the palate by two slips, which are separated by the levator palati and azygos uvulae muscles, and the fibres of which meet those of the opposite muscle in the median line. The muscle passes obliquely downwards to the- pharynx, to be inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid carti- lage with the stylo-pharyngeus, and to be lost in the wall of the pharynx itself.THE PALATE. 396 The palatoglossus muscle is a constrictor of the fauces, and grasps the bolus of food when it has passed out of the mouth, thus prevent- ing its return. The palato-pharyngeus raises the pharynx, but its most important action is to approximate the posterior pillars of the fauces, which-with the uvula then make an inclined plane along which the bolus passes into the grasp of the constrictors. Both the palatoglossus and the palato-pharyngeus are supplied by branches from Meckel's ganglion. The Amygdala or Tonsil is placed between the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus muscles, and is usually much shrunken after death. It consists of lymphoid tissue with a number of mucous follicles, the orifices of which may be seen on the internal surface. The outside of the tonsil is in close relation with the superior constrictor of the pharynx and with the ascending pharyngeal artery. It is to be noticed that it is anatomically impossible for any enlargement of the tonsil to obstruct the Eustachian tube, and thus produce deafness. TThe tongue and the larynx are to be detached by dividing all the structures between them and the palate, and are to be ^rfuny^e- served for subsequent examination. By inverting the skull the naid palate will then be brought into view.] The Hard Palate (Fig. 209, 7) is continuous with the soft palate, but its mucous membrane is much more dense, being inseparably united in great part with the periosteum of the maxillary and palate bones. The mucous membrane presents a median ridge indicative ot the foetal division of the parts, and is thrown into more or ]ess trans- verse folds near the anterior part, where it is prolonged on to the gums. Numerous mucous glands lie immediately beneath the mucous membrane and open upon its surface. The Gums (Fig. 208) are composed of dense fibrous tissue insepar- ably united with the periosteum of the alveolus, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth, which is prolonged into the sockets of the teeth, where it becomes continuous with the periodontal mem- brane covering them. _ The Teeth (Fig. 208) of the upper jaw are 16 m number, viz., 4 incisors, 2 canines^ bicuspids, and 6 molars, the most posterior molars being the denies sapiential or wisdom teeth. Each tooth consists of a arown, a neck, and a fang, and upon extracting a molar be found to have three fangs, two being on the outer (buccal) and one on the inner (palatine) side. , The teeth of the lower jaw correspond in number to those of the upper jaw, but have been necessarily interfered with in the progress397 THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. of the dissection. The lower molar teeth differ from those of the upper jaw in presenting only two fangs. The Lips (Fig. 208) are formed externally by skin, and internally by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to them from the gums 5 Fig. 208. and between the two are the fibres of the orbicularis oris, with some cellular tissue and mucous glands and the coronary arteries. The fold of mucous membrane connecting each lip with the alveolus in the median line is called the frcenum labii, and is more prominent in the upper than in the lower lip. The Superior Maxillary Nerve. [The skull being placed with the base downwards, a cut with the chisel is to be carried in a straight line from the sphenoidal fissure to the foramen ovale. The side of the skull is then to be sawn through at right angles to the first incision, meeting it at the foramen ovale.

S98 that the incision shall pass downwards and outwards from the lower and outer angle of the orbit, the cut is to be carried into the spheno- maxillary fissure. The piece of hone will now he detached and may he removed, and with the hone-forceps any remaining hone is then to be taken away, so as to expose the whole extent of the superior maxillary nerve.] The Superior Maxillary Nerve (Fig. 208, i) (second division of the 5th) leaves the cranium at the foramen rotundum, and, having crossed the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the infra-orbital canal and appears on the face at the infra-orbital foramen. It gives off the following branches:— 1. Orbital branch (temporo-malar) (4) which enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two branches (malar and tem- poral), which have been seen in the dissection of the face and scalp. 2. Sphenopalatine branches (6) which descend to Meckel's ganglion placed opposite the sphenopalatine foramen, and will be afterwards cl i s sc c t gcI • 3. Posterior dental branches (2) which supply the gums, and enter the canals on the posterior aspect of the upper jaw, to supply the molar and bicuspid teeth and to communicate with the anterior dental nerve. 4. Anterior dental branch (5) which arises from the nerve in the infra- orbital canal, and can only be seen by laying the canal open. It descends in a special canal in the wall of the antrum to the incisor and canine teeth, and has a communication with the posterior dental nerve. The branches of the dental nerves can only be traced to the teeth by removing the outer plate of the alveolus, but the expenditure of time and trouble necessary for this will not be repaid by the results. The facial branches of the superior maxillary nerve have been seen in the dissection of the face (p. 356). The Infra-orbital Artery accompanies the superior maxillary nerve. It is the terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery, and gives a branch to the orbit, and an anterior dental branch which accompanies the anterior dental nerve to the teeth. The infra-orbital vein communicates with the facial vein, and ends in the internal maxillary vein. The Cavity of the Nose. Tin making a section of the nasal cavities it will be found to be almost impossible to preserve the septum and the turbinate bonesot both sides uninjured, and the better plan therefore is to prwen e the septum carefully at the expense of the turbinate bone, oi: 0ne side, and afterwards to remove it so as to obtain a good vie* 01 tneTHE CAVITY OF THE NOSE. 399 turbinate bones and meatuses of the nose on the opposite side. The saw being placed on one side of the septum and parallel to it, is to be carried through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and the palatine processes of the maxillary and palate bones; and the soft palate having been split in the middle line, the skull will be divided into two portions, one of which can be used for the examination of the nose, and the other for the dissection of Meckel's ganglion, etc.] The Septum Narium (Fig. 210, i) is a vertical plate, which upon removal of the mucous membrane will be found to be partly bony and partly cartilaginous. The bones entering into its formation are the following :—the crest of the nasal bone, the nasal spine of the frontal bone, the large perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer, a part of the rostrum of the sphenoid bone, and the crests of the maxillary and palate bones upon which the vomer rests below. The cartilage of the septum is triangular in shape, and fits into the interval between the vertical plate of the ethmoid and the vomer, but it not unfrequently extends backwards for a considerable distance between those bones when they are not so fully developed as usual. The whole septum may be bent considerably to one side as the result of congenital malformation or of violence, and the cartilage may be perforated either congenitally or from disease. The vomer presents an oblique groove for the naso-palatine nerve, which will be afterwards seen upon the opposite side of the bone. [The septum is to be removed piecemeal with the bone-forceps, so as to leave the mucous membrane on the opposite side untouched. The naso-palatine nerve and artery, and some branches of the olfactory nerve at the upper part of the membrane, may be seen if putrefaction is not too far advanced. The mucous membrane is then to be de- tached below and turned up, when the nasal cavity will be exposed.] The Nasal Fossa (Fig. 209) is a cavity bounded above by a roof which slopes anteriorly and posteriorly, but is horizontal in the middle, being formed anteriorly by the nasal bone and the nasal spine of the frontal bone ; in the middle by the horizontal cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone ; and posteriorly by the under surfaces of the body of the sphenoid bone and of the sphenoidal process of the palate bone. The floor is slightly concave from side to side, and is formed by the palatine processes of the maxillary and palate bones. The inner wall is formed by the septum, which has been examined. The outer wall is divided into three meatuses by the projection from it of the three turbinate bones, of which the two upper are portions of the ethmoid bone, but the lowest is a separate bone articulated upon the orifice of the antrum.THE CAVITY OF THE NOSE. 400 Fig. 2C9. The Superior Meatus (b) is "between the superior and middle tur- binate bones, and is the smallest of the three, extending for not more than one-third of the length of the outer wall. The posterior eth- moidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus open into this meatus, and the sphenopalatine foramen is immediately opposite to it. - The Middle Meatus (g) is between the middle and inferior turbinate a 1 bones, and extends along the posterior two-thirds of the outer wall, curving upwards anteriorly. The anterior eth- moidal cells, the frontal sinus (through the infundibulum of the ethmoid bone), and the antrum of Highmore open into the meatus. The Inferior Meatus (7c) is between the inferior turbinate bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It extends the whole length of the fossa, and at the anterior part has the nasal duct opening into it. It should he noticed that the orifice of the Eustachian tube is close to the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinate hone, and thatin using the Eustachian catheter, the point of the instrument has there- fore to he raised before it can enter the tube.

The upper part of the mucous membrane both on the outer and inner walls of the fossa is peculiar, and has been named the Olfactory- Region, from the fact that the branches of the olfactory or first nerve are distributed to it. It is impossible to distinguish this region except immediately after death, but it comprises the upper and a portion of the middle turbinate bones, and the corresponding portion of the septum. The mucous membrane of the olfactory region is of a yellow colour in the recent state, and its epithelium is of the columnar 11. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 0.

The remainder of the mucous membrane has columnar and ciliated cells, except at the anterior part corresponding to the cartilaginous portion of the nose, where the epithelium is squamous. The Olfactory Nerve (Fig. 210, a) is the special nerve of smell, and its branches, which are derived from the olfactory bulb, reach the nasal cavity by piercing the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The branches are distributed to the olfactory region, *.e., upon the superior and middle turbinate bones and the upper third of the septum, but are very difficult to follow, owing to their being destitute of the white substance of Schwann. The nerves of common sensation to the nose are derived trom Meckel's ganglion, and will be afterwards dissected. rWith a strong pair of scissors the turbinate bones may be readily cut, so as to expose the several openings into the three meatuses.] The Nasal Duct {ductus ad nasum) communicates between the lachrymal sac and the inferior meatus of the nose. It grooves the superior maxillary, lachrymal, and inferior turbinate bones, and consists of a fibrous tube lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium. . . „ The nasal branch of the fifth nerve (ophthalmic division) (Fig. 210, d) may be found in a groove on the under surface of the nasal bone m its passage from the orbit to the face, and gives a branch to the septum (pp. 320 and 356). Dissection of Meckel's Ganglion, etc. Before beginning this dissection, the student should ascertain the position of the sphenopalatine foramen (Fig. 209, e), opposite to which maxllary artery enters the nose. This will be found on either half of the skull immediately behind the superior meatus of the nose.

Fig. 211. 10 The Branches (Fig. 211) of the ganglion are ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. 1. The ascending branches are two or three of very small size, which pass to the periosteum of the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure. 2. The descending branches go to the palate, and are three in number:— Fig. 211.—Meckel's ganglion and its branches (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

The pterygopalatine artery is very small, and runs backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal. 4. The nasal or sphenopalatine artery enters the nose by the sphenopalatine foramen, and gives branches to the mucous-mem- brane of the upper part of the cavity, which anastomose with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery. The nasopalatine branch runs down the septum of the nose with the naso-palatine nerve, and anastomoses with the artery of the septum from the facial trunk, and also with the descending palatine artery through the anterior palatine canal. The veins correspond, and open into the internal maxillary vein. The Otic Ganglion. [If the part is not too much decomposed, the otic ganglion may be exposed, from within, on the side upon which the internal pterygoid muscle has not been cut away. The levator palati muscle and the Eustachian tube are to be carefully removed, when upon the inner surface of the pterygoid muscle will be found the nerve to that muscle, which if traced, upwards will lead to the ganglion.] The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 212, 7) (Arnold's) is a minute body lying on the inner surface of the third division of the fifth nerve, and especially connected with the branch to the internal pterygoid muscle. Like all the cranial ganglia, the otic has motor, sensory, and sympathetic roots ; the motor root from the 5th nerve; the sensory roots from the auriculo-temporal nerve, and from Jacobson's nerve by means of the small superficial petrosal nerve of Arnold, which is connected posteriorly with the facial nerve in the temporal bone ; and the sympathetic root from that upon the middle meningeal artery. The otic ganglion gives branches to two muscles, the tensor tympani and the circumflexus or tensor palati, i.e. it supplies two tensors as Meckel's ganglion does two elevators (v. p.^8^.14 0 i± The Tympanum.

By this cut the cavity of the tympanum will be divided, and it will be possible to examine its walls and ossicula, together with the seventh nerve and the chorda tympani.] The Tympanum or Middle Ear (Fig. 212) is an irregular six- sided cavity, which may be conveniently said to resemble a room, with a passage (meatus auditorius externus) leading to it. The outer wall of the chamber is formed by the membrana tympani, which is placed obliquely Fig. 212. at the end of the meatus, and consists of three layers, epithelial, fibrous, and mucous ; the inner wall corresponds to the outer wall of the vesti- bule and cochlea, parts of the internal ear; in front, is the opening of the Eustachian tube, with the special tube for the tensor tympani muscle formed by the processus cochleari- formis ; behind, is the opening into the mastoid cells. The roof of the chamber is a thin portion of bone separating it from the cavity of the cranium ; the floor is a thicker portion corresponding to the jugular fossa. following The inner wall is the most important, and presents the Mowmg points for examination (Fig. 208): (1) the fenestra ovate m winch the base of the stapes articulates ; below this (2) the fenestra rotunda^ opening into the cochlea closed by a membrane, the secondary mm- riff 212.-Int.emal view of the Otic ganglion and Tympanum (from °' " Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Aqueduct of Fallopius, or canal for the facial nerve, forms a slight projection curving behind the pyramid and above the fenestra ovalis, and may be opened with bone-forceps in the part which has not been already divided with the saw. It extends from the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus to the stylo-mastoid foramen. In the Upper part of the canal is the intumescentia ganglioformis, an enlargement of the facial nerve at the point where it is joined by the petrosal nerves through the hiatus Fallopii. The facial nerve in this part of its course gives off a minute branch to the stapedius muscle, and the chorda tympani. The Chorda Tympani (Fig. 212, 9) enters the tympanum close to the pyramid, and passes forward, between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, to an opening between the Glas- serian fissure and the Eustachian tube (canal of Huguier), by which it leaves the temporal bone to join the lingual nerve (p. 369). The Ossicula Auditus (Fig. 212) are the malleus, incus, and stapes. The Malleus (hammer) (4) consists of a head, neck, handle (manubrium), and two processes (processus gracilis and processus brevis). The head articulates with the incus ; the manubrium is in- serted between the mucous and fibrous layers of the membrana tym- pani ; the processus gracilis is inserted into the Glasserian fissure ; the processus brevis gives attachment to the tensor tympani muscle. The Incus (anvil) (6) consists of a body and two processes. The body articulates with the head of the malleus; the short process is attached to the margin of the orifice of the mastoid cells ; the long process is nearly parallel to the handle of the malleus, and has at its extremity a small nodule of bone, the os orbiculare, which in the foetus is separate, but becomes united in adult life and articulates with the stapes. The Stapes (stirrup) is articulated by its head with the long process of the incus, and at right angles to it. The base (at which the two crura unite) is attached to the fenestra ovalis ; the neck gives attach- ment to the small stapedius muscle. The Muscles of the Tympanum are three in number, viz., the tensor tympani, laxator tympani, and stapedius ; but some anatomists add a fourth, the Laxator tympani minor.THE TONGUE. 408 The Tensor Tympani (Fig. 212, 2) arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and from the Eustachian tube, and runs backwards in a distinct canal formed by the processus cochleariformis, to be inserted into the root of the handle and the processus brevis of the malleus. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. The Laxator Tympani arises from the under surface of the spine of the sphenoid bone and from the Eustachian tube, and entering the tympanum through the Glasserian fissure is inserted into the neck of the malleus. It is supplied by a branch from the chorda tympani. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and emerges from its apex to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. It is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve. The Laxator Tympani Minor arises from the upper margin of the meatus externus, and is inserted into the handle and processus brevis of the malleus. It is regarded as a ligament by many anatomists. The Tongue. TThe tongue and larynx, which were laid aside, are to be examined without separating them. The branches of nerves and the several muscles, which were necessarily divided in removing the tongue, are to be identified before the examination of the organ itself is proceeded with.] The Tongue (Fig. 213) is connected with the os hyoides by mus- cular fibres, and by a membrane (hyo-glossal) which is deeply placed between the muscles. On its under surface and sides will be found the attachments of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, viz., the hyo- glossus, stylo-glossus, palato-glossus, and superior constrictor (glosso- pharyngeus) ; and close to the median line will be seen the large genio-hyo-glossus of each side. All the anterior part of the dorsum of the tongue is covered by papillse, but behind a V-shaped row of large (circumvallate) papillae the surface only presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and follicles. , _.. The Papillse (Fig. 213) of the tongue are of three kmds, the Cir- cumvallate, Fungiform, and Filiform or Conical. The papillae circumvallatce (5) are from eight to fifteen m number, and are arranged in two oblique rows which meet at the foremen cceeum, a deep mucous follicle. Each papilla is surrounded by a fossa, and is covered on its free surface with secondary papilla?. Lha circumvallate papilla? are the special organs of taste, and are supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve.INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF TONGUE. 409 Fig. 213. The papilla fungiformes are scattered over the tongue, but par- ticularly at the tip and sides. They are globular in form and have slender attachments to the surface of the tongue ; they are of a dark red colour and are covered with secondary papillae. The papillae conicce and filiformes exist all over the tongue, but are most extensively developed at the tip. The conical papillae are covered with minute secondary papillae, and the filiform are prolonged into thread- like processes, wThich in the carnivora are developed into spines. The orifices of mucous follicles may be found among the papillae on the dorsum of the tongue, and behind the papillae circumvallatce are numerous compound racemose lingual glands, which lubricate the posterior portion of the organ. Beneath" the mucous membrane is a fibrous layer or corium, which gives attach- ment to many of the muscular fibres. In the centre of the tongue and dividing it into two symmetrical halves is a fibrous septum, the existence of which is marked by a raphe in the median line. The Intrinsic Muscles are the Lin- gualis Superior, the Lingualis Transversus, and the Lingualis Inferior. The Lingualis Superior extends along the surface of the tongue immediately beneath the mucous mem- brane, being connected with the septum internally. The Linguadis Transversus constitutes the chief bulk of the tongue, and is placed beneath the lingualis superior. Its fibres are attached to the median septum and pass outwards to the mucous membrane, giving passage to the ascending fibres of the lingualis inferior.

OS410 THE LARYNX. The Lingualis Inferior is to be seen on the tinder surface of the tongue by removing the hyo-glossus. It is larger than the lingualis superior, and extends along the under surface of the tongue, giving ascending fibres which pass between those of the transverse muscle, and being closely connected with the stylo-glossus muscle. Glands of the Frcenum (Blandin).—By removing the mucous mem- brane on the under surface of the tongue near the tip, a couple of oval glands may be seen. They are similar in structure to the sub- lingual glands although distinct from them, and are sometimes united in front, forming a single mass of an arched form (Deville). The Nerves (Fig. 198) of the tongue have been already examined, but may now be followed out minutely. They are the Hypoglossal nerve (9th) to the muscular structure of the tongue; the Lingual nerve (5th) to the fungiform and filiform papillae on the dorsum and apex of the tongue ; the Glossopharyngeal nerve (8th) to the circum- vallate papillre at the base of the tongue and to the surface behind them. / The Larynx. The Larynx or organ of voice is closely connected with the hyoid bone and tongue. On tracing the mucous membrane from the dorsum of the tongue, it will be found to form three little frcena between the base of that organ and the prominent cartilage of the epiglottis ; these are the glosso^iglottidean folds (Fig. 213, 9). After being reflected over the epiglottis, the mucous membrane forms the two arytceno-epiglottidean folds, which bound the superior aperture of the larynx ; and is then carried to the interior of the larynx and over its posterior surface into the oesophagus. The Superior Aperture of the Larynx (Fig. 206) is bounded in front by the epiglottis, behind by the arytenoid cartilages, and on each side by the aryteeno-epiglottidean folds. On looking through it the Glottis or Bima Glottidis will be seen, i.e., the space between the two inferior or true vocal cords, which varies from a mere clunk to a triangular aperture with the apex forwards, according to the movements of the arytenoid cartilages. Above the true vocal cords will be seen the less distinct false cords, and through the glottis may be seen the interior of the trachea. This view of the parts deserves especial notice, as it is exactly that which is seen reversed when reflected in the laryngoscope.

The Crico-thyroid Muscle (Fig. 179, 22) is placed on each side of the crico-thyroid membrane and is somewhat triangular in shape, being narrow below and expanded above. It arises from an oval surface on the side of the cricoid cartilage, and ascends to be inserted into the posterior part of the lower border and inner surface, and into the inferior cornu, of the thyroid cartilage. It is supplied by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. [The preparation is to be turned over and the mucous membrane is to be dissected off the back of the larynx, the remnant of the oesophagus being removed. The crico-aryteenoiclei postici muscles on the back of the cricoid cartilage are readily dissected ; but in order to clean the cross-fibres of the arytsenoideus it will be necessary to over- distend the larynx so as to stretch the muscle ; and this maybe most readily done by the finger of an assistant.] The Arytsenoideus (Fig. 214, 6) is an example of a single muscle in the median line, its fibres crossing one another and being equally distributed on each side. It occupies the concave posterior surfaces of the two arytsenoid cartilages, the fibres passing from one to the other, and being divisible into superficial and deep layers. The superficial fibres cross obliquely from the apex of one carti- lage to the base of the other, and vice versa, so as to form an X, whilst the deeper fibres pass transversely between them. The arytsenoideus is supplied by both the superior and the inferior laryngeal nerves. The Crico-Arytsenoideus Posticus (Fig. 214, 7) arises from the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage on one side of the median ridge, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and out- wards to be inserted on the posterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of the base of the arytaenoid cartilage. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. Fig. 214. Fig. 214.—Posterior view of the larynx (from Wilson). 1. Thyroid cartilage, right ala. 6. Arytamoideus muscle, consisting 2.

[To seethe crico-arytsenoideuslateralis and thethyro-arytsenoideus muscles, the superior and inferior cornua of one half of the thyroid cartilage should be cut through and the ala drawn forward, any tissue being detached from its inner surface to within a quarter ot an inch, of the median line. A vertical cut is then to be made through it there with strong scissors or the bone-forceps, and the piece is to be removed. The larynx being distended as before, the muscles can be readily dissected.] The Crico-Aryteenoideus Lateralis (Fig. 215,6) arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the anterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. This muscle is al- ways more or less closely connected with the thyro-arytamoideus, which is above it, and is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. The Thyro-Arytsenoideus (Fig. 215, 7) has a more horizontal direction than the preceding muscle. It arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately external to the inferior or true vocal cord, and reaches down to the crico-thyroid membrane, to which some of its fibres are attached. It passes backwards, the upper fibres being more oblique than the lower ones to be inserted into the anterior border of the arytenoid cartilage external to the attachments of the vocal cords. It is supplied bv the inferior laryngeal nerve. rif a second larynx can be procured, a very satisfactory way of Keeii /the thyro-aryta3noid muscles is to cut the thyroid cartilage horon ally a the level of the true vocal cords, when the muscles can beReadily displayed immediately outside them.] Above the preceding muscles a few muscular fibres may be traced to the epiglottis from both the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilage.

Actions of the Laryngeal Muscles. The cartilages are moved upon one another by the several muscles, producing an effect upon either the tension of the vocal cords or the size of the opening between them—the glottis. The Crico-thyroidei draw the thyroid cartilage downwards and forwards on the cricoid cartilage, and thus tighten the vocal cords. The Thyro-arytcenoidei being parallel to, and attached to the same points as, the vocal cords, must necessarily by their contraction approximate the points of attachment, and so relax the cords. The Crico-arytmnoidei postici swing the arytsenoid cartilages out- wards, and thus dilate the glottis ; as can be easily shown by making traction upon the two muscles simultaneously with the points of a pair of forceps. The Crico-arytmnoidei laterales are antagonists to the postici, and bring the arytsenoid cartilages back to their old positions, and after- wards approximate them, thus narrowing the glottis. The Arytamoideus draws the arytaenoid cartilages together, and thus (according to Mr. Bishop) narrows the glottis ; but it may be doubted whether the superficial fibres which are inserted farthest out would not swing the cartilages upon their axes and thus widen the glottis. [A side view of the interior of the larynx is now to be obtained by cutting away the crico-arytsenoideus lateralis, with the vocal cords and mucous membrane of the same side, but the cricoid cartilage is to be left entire.] On a Side-view (Fig. 216) of the interior of the larynx will be seen the horizontal projections of the mucous membrane formed by the superior and inferior vocal cords beneath it. Between the two cords is the cavity of the ventricle of the larynx, and from the front i of this a probe can be carried into the laryngeal pouch or sacculus laryngis, which projects upward between the upper cord and the I thyroid cartilage. The mucous membrane is continued from the • ventricle into the sac, in which it is provided with numerous mucous | glands. [The mucous membrane is to be dissected from the vocal cords and their attachments are to be clearly shown.] The Vocal Cords or Thyro-arytsenoid Ligaments (Fig. 216)THE LARYNX. 414 a. Epiglottis. Central portion of the same mem- Fig. 216. are four in number, two on each side of the larynx, the inferior pair, or chorda vocales being composed of yellow or elastic fibrous tissue. The superior ligament or false cord (h) has an arched direction and is much more slender than the inferior ligament. It is attached m front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the projection on the upper part of the front of the arytenoid cartilage The inferior ligament or true cord [%) is horizontal^ direction, being attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage below the superior ligament, and behind to the prominent anterior angle of the base of the aryte- noid cartilage. This is the free upper edge of the crico-thyroid membrane. The interval between the two true vocal cords is the rima glottidis. The Arteries of the larynx are de- rived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The superior laryngeal artery, derived from the superior thyroid, enters the larynx through the thyro-hyoid mem- brane, and divides into ascending and descending branches which supply the muscles and mucous membrane. The inferior laryngeal artery, derived from the inferior thyroid artery, reaches the back of the cricoid cartilage and anastomoses with the superior artery. ~"^T^3^^ laiW lowing its ligaments 11>= • (from Wilson).

The superior laryngeal nerve (9) has been seen to give a branch (external laryngeal) to the crico-thyroid muscle, and then to pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane with the superior laryngeal artery. It supplies the mucous membrane of the larynx and back of the tongue, and gives a branch to the arytsenoideus muscle, besides a communi- cating branch to the inferior laryngeal nerve. The inferior or recurrent nerve (21) is the motor nerve of the larynx, and has been seen to take a different course on the two sides, winding around the subclavian artery on the right, and around the aorta on the left side, but in the larynx the nerves have similar distributions. Each nerve running up the side of the trachea passes beneath the border of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx and beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, to end in branches to the muscles of the larynx. It supplies all the muscles of the larynx except the crico- thyroid, and thus one muscle, the arytamoideus, is supplied from two sources, though it is doubtful whether the superior nerve does not perforate the arytsenoideus without supplying it, in order to reach the mucous membrane. [In order to see the ligaments which bind the several parts of the larynx together, it will be necessary to remove cautiously all the muscular fibres and mucous membrane.] The Thyro-hyoid Ligament (Fig. 216, 8) connects the upper border of the thyroid cartilage with the hyoid bone. It is composed of yellow elastic tissue, and may be divided into a central portion or membrane, and two rounded lateral portions (9), which pass from the great cornu of the hyoid bone to the superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and in which a nodule of cartilage is often developed. The thyro-hyoid membrane is perforated by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. The Crico-thyroid Membrane or Ligament (Fig. 216, I, m) is composed of elastic tissue, and passes between the borders of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages in the median line, but at the sides is prolonged to the inferior vocal cords, with which it is incorporated. The Crico-tracheal Ligament is between the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and the upper ring of the trachea, and is a simple membrane like that between the several rings of the trachea. Capsular Ligaments surround the articular extremities of the cartilages, which are also furnished with synovial membranes. These exist in the articulations between the cricoid and the inferior cornui416 THE LARYNX. 6. Epiglottis. of the thyroid cartilage; and between the cricoid and the bases of the two arytenoid cartilages. The Thyro-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, c) connects the lower border of the epiglottis Fig. 217.' with the back of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the notch in its upper border. The Hyo-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, b) is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the apex of the epiglottis and the upper border of the hyoid bone. Cartilages of the Larynx. [The large cartilages of the larynx, viz. the thyroid, cricoid, two arytenoid, and the cartilage of the epiglottis, are readily re- cognised, but two pairs of minute cartilages, the cornicula laryngis and the cuneiform cartilages, are to be looted for in the arytseno- epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane.] The Thyroid Cartilage (Fig. 214, i) (6vpe6s etSo?,like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx, and consists of two halves or alee, which meet at an angle give attachmenttoJh^rico:t^ l^iT^Y^^ tongue (from Universrty • Jug-i" ' College Museum). ^ .„ • i1of^ 7.

On the side of the ala is an oblique ridge, extending from a.tubercle at the root of the superior cornu to another tubercle about the middle •of the lower border of the cartilage. The ridge gives attachment to the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles, and the surface behind it to the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The inner surfaces of the alse are smooth, and in the receding angle formed by their junction seven structures are attached, viz. the thyro-epiglottidean ligament, the two pairs of thyro-arytsenoid ligaments (false and true vocal cords), and the two thyro-arytsenoid muscles, just externally to the inferior ligaments or true cords (Fig. 216). The Cricoid Cartilage (Fig. 215, 4) (*ptW elSos, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, shallow in front (where it has been seen to be con- nected with the thyroid cartilage by a membrane, and has the crico- thyroideus attached to its surface), but deep behind, where it fills up a part of the space left between the posterior borders of the thyroid* The upper border of the deep portion presents two oval articular surfaces for the arytsenoid cartilages, external to which are the origins of the crico-arytsenoidei laterales. On each side, and near the lower border of the cartilage, are two small facets for articulation with the inferior cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The posterior surface is divided in the middle line by a vertical ridge, to which some of the fibres of the oesophagus are attached, the concave surface on each side giving origin to the crico- arytsenoidei postici muscles. The Arytsenoid Cartilages (Fig. 216, d) {apvraiva, a pitcher*) are two in number, and are of a pyramidal shape. The base of each cartilage is triangular, and articulates with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; its anterior angle gives attachment to the true vocal cord, and its external angle to the crico-arytsenoideus posticus and crico-arytsenoideus lateralis. The apex is curved backwards and inwards, and is surmounted by the corniculum laryngis. The posterior surface of the cartilage is concave, and gives attachment to the arytsenoideus muscle; the anterior surface presents a small tubercle for the attachment of the false vocal cord, and also gives attachment to the thyro-arytsenoideus muscle ; the internal surface is smooth, and covered with mucous membrane. The Cornicula !Laryngis or Cartilages of Santorini (Fie. 216,/) are two small conical cartilages connected with the apices of * This derivation has reference to the appearance of both cartilages taken together and covered by mucous membrane. In animals, which were th« E E418 LIGAMENTS OF T^E VERTEBRA. the arytenoid cartilages and with the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. They are composed of yellow fihro-cartilage. The Cuneiform Cartilages or Cartilages of Wnsberg (tig. 216 g) are two small bodies found in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, and are sometimes wanting. They are com- posed of yellow fibro-cartilage. The Epiglottis (Fig. 216, a) is composed of yellow nbro-cartilage shaped like a cordate leaf, and has been seen to be connected with the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone. It is covered with mucous membrane, upon removing which it will be found to be perforated especially in the posterior aspect, by numerous holes, in which mucous glands are lodged,/ ■ The large cartilages of the larynx are very apt to undergo calcareous degeneration in advanced life, and the epiglottis is not unfrequently thickened by disease or injured by ulceration. Ligaments of the Vertebra. [The ligaments of the spinal column are to be examined by re- moving all the remaining muscular fibres. J The Ligaments of the Bodies of the vertebra, are-1 the Anterior Common Ligament; 2, the Posterior Common Ligament; and 3, the Intervertebral Substance or Fibro-cartilage. The Anterior Common Ligament (Fig. 218, i) is a ro - of fibres extending down the front of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are attached princi- pally to the intervertebral substances, and only slightly to the upper and lower margins of the vertebrae ; the deep fibres passing between the adjacent bones, but the superficial crossing three or more vertebra. The ligament when divided will be seen to be thicker opposite the bodies of the vertebrae than on the inter- Fig. 218.

[To see the posterior common ligament it will be necessary to remove the spinal cord, if this has not been already done, as follows : the saw is to be applied over the pedicles of, say, six dorsal vertebrae, and these being divided on each side, the remains of the spinal cord can be removed, when the posterior ligament will be seen on the backs of the bodies of the vertebrae ; and the ligamenta subflava can be dissected upon the vertebral arches which have been removed.] The Posterior Common Ligament (Fig. 219, 3) is found upon the posterior aspect of the bodies of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum. It is remarkable in being broad opposite the intervertebral substances, with 219. which it is closely connected, and narrow oppo- site the bodies of the vertebras, over which it stretches to allow of the passage of vessels to the bone. It is broader in the cervical than in the lumbar region, but thickest in the dorsal region, and is composed of superficial and deep fibres like the anterior ligament. The Intervertebral Substance (Fig. 219, 1) is found between the bodies of all the vertebras 1 from the axis to the sacrum, and is largest in the lumbar region. Each substance is composed of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage externally, but has a soft elastic material in the centre. The substances vary according to the curves of the spinal column, being deepest in front in the cervical and lumbar regions and the reverse in the dorsal region. On dissecting the superficial fibres of an intervertebral substance they will be found to pass obliquely between the adjacent vertebrae, alternate layers taking opposite directions. By cutting through the attachment to one of the vertebrae with a strong knife, the pulpy material in the centre will be shown, and will expand considerably . above the level of the fibro-cartilaginous rings around it. On making a vertical section of two or more vertebrae with their intervertebral substances, the structure of the intervertebral sub- Fig. 219.—Posterior ligament of the vertebrae (from Wilson). I* 1.

The plates of both series are arranged one within another, the superficial ones being slightly bent towards the surface and the deeper ones towards the centre. < The Articular Processes are surrounded by Capsular Ligaments me 220, 2), which are looser in the cervical than in the dorsal and lumbar regions ; they permit a simple gliding movement (arthrodia) between the processes, which are invested by a simple synovial membrane. » The Arches are united by the Ligamenta Subflava (Fig. 220, i). These are to be seen on the internal surfaces of the arches which have been removed, and wiU be found to consist of a series of yellow elastic ligaments, extending between the arches of the vertebrae on each side of the middle line from the axis to the sacrum. Owing to the overlapping of the vertebrae, the ligaments are attached to the posterior surface of the arch below and to the anterior surface of the arch above, ex- tending from the articular process to the root of the spinous process on each side.

Ligaments op the Atlas, Axis, and Occiput. [In order to examine the special ligaments of the first two cervical vertebrae and the occipital bone, it will be convenient to separate the whole of the cervical from the dorsal spine.] The ligaments of the first two vertebrae and the occipital bone may be conveniently divided into (1) those external to, and (2) those internal to the vertebral canal. The external ligaments more or less resemble the ligaments common to the vertebral column, but the internal ligaments have special relation to the movements of nuta- tion and rotation which are peculiar to this region. 1. The External Ligaments are the Anterior, Posterior, and Lateral Occipito-Atlantal, and the Anterior and Posterior Atlanto-axial liga- ments ; besides Capsular ligaments for the articular processes of the vertebrae and the condyles of the occipital bone. The Anterior Occipito-Atlan- tal Ligament (Fig. 221) consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion (i) is round, and is attached to the basilar pro- cess of the occipital bone above, and to the anterior tubercle of the atlas below. The deep portion (2) is broad and membranous, and is attached to the occipital bone close to the foramen magnum above, and to the upper margin of the anterior arch of the atlas below. Fig. 221. 3. 4.

It ex- tends between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminae of the axis. 2. The Internal Ligaments are the Occipito-Axial, the Cruciform, and the Odontoid ligaments. [To expose these ligaments it will be necessary to saw through the occipital bone obliquely on each side of the foramen magnum. The posterior part of the bone being removed, the arches of the atlas and axis are to be cut through on each side and removed, and any re- mains of the spinal cord dissected away with the dura-mater, when the occipito-axial ligament will be exposed.] The Occipito-Axial Ligament (Fig. 223, 5) (apparatus ligamen- tosus colli) is continuous with the posterior common ligament. It is attached below to the back of the body of the axis, and above to the basilar groove of the occipital bone above the foramen magnum, through which it passes. [The occipito-axial ligament is to be divided and turned up and down, when the cruciform ligament of the atlas and axis will be brought into view, and immediately above the transverse portion will be seen the two oblique odontoid ligaments.] The Cruciform Ligament (Fig. 224) consists of a strong trans- verse ligament and two small vertical slips.

The vertical slips of the cruciform ligament pass from the transverse ligament to the basilar process of the occipital bone and the body of the axis re- spectively, and by detaching the upper one the odontoid ligaments will be fully seen. The Odontoid or Check Ligaments (Fig. 224, 5) are two strong bands of fibres, which pass obliquely from the apex of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum on each side, and they thus check the rotation of the cranium and atlas upon the odontoid process Between these is a central odontoid ligament (hgamentum suspens'orium dentis), passing vertically between the margin of the foramen magnum and the top of the odontoid process. On cutting all the ligaments of the articulation except the trans- verse ligament of the atlas, the odontoid process will be found to be still firmly held in position, owing to the fact that the ligament sur- rounds the contracted neck of the odontoid process, which is consider- ably smaller than the head.

[Tlie arms having been previously removed, the dissectors of the thorax should detach the remains of the pectoral, serrati, and abdo- minal muscles from the outer surfaces of the ribs and their cartilages, and dissect the external intercostal muscles.] The External Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99,4) eleven in number, are placed between the ribs, being attached to the lower and upper borders of the adjacent bones, the fibres running obliquely downwards and forwards. The external intercostals extend from the tubercles of the ribs to their line of junction with the cartilages, beyond which point a thin fascia is prolonged to the sternum. Between the floating ribs the fibres cease at the extremities of the bones. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99, 5) take a direction opposite to that of the external muscles, and can now be seen partially near the sternum, where the external muscles are wanting, but are fully seen subsequently from within the thorax. TThe knife is to be carried through the cartilages of all the true ribs as near the bones as possible, and then along the intercostal space between the 5th and 6th ribs to the lower part of the sternum, lhe sternum being sawn across at this point can then be turned up, tlie ■pleurae beina divided near the median line so as to preserve the an- terior mediastinum, and the internal mammary vessels being neces- sarily cut across with the bone.] The Triangularis Sterni Muscle (Fig. 225, 3) lies at the back of the sternum, but is ordinarily damaged by the incision made for inject- ing the subject, and the muscle is therefore best seen on a fresh sternum from a post-mortem examination. It arises from the inner surface oi the ensiform cartilage and lower part of the sternum, and from the carti- lages of the last three or four true ribs ; and is inserted mto the carti- lages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs. The triangularis sterni actsTHE MEDIASTINA. 429 as a muscle of expiration by depressing the ribs, and is supplied by the intercostal nerves. [The sternum, which is still attached by the muscles of the front of the neck, is to be divided in the centre, and the two halves are to be turned aside, so as to preserve the internal mammary arteries for after- examination.] On opening the thorax as directed, the lungs will be exposed by the necessary division of the pleurae, and will be seen to occupy the sides of the chest, having probably, unless attached by old adhesions, fallen back so as to leave the pericardium exposed. The great vessels of the heart will be seen emerging from the upper part of the peri- cardium, and if the lungs are fully collapsed, the roots of the lungs will be visible on each side. The pericardium will in all probability have been opened at the upper part to allow of the injection of the body, in which case a portion of the heart may be seen within it, and it may be advantageously closed with a stitch. The Pleurae (Fig. 225) are two shut sacs of serous membrane lining the thorax and covering the lung, but have been opened in removing the sternum. One of the lungs is to be drawn forward, when its pleura can be readily traced over the inner surface of the sternum and ribs (costal or parietal layer) on to the back of the lung; thence over the lung (pulmonary layer) to the front of the root of the lung, by which it is directed to the pericardium, and carried forward to the sternum a little to one side of the median line. Frequently it will be impossible to trace the pleura in this manner, owing to the adhesions which have formed between the pleura costalis and pleura pulmonalis as the result of inflammation. When the lung is drawn forward, below its root will be found a fold of pleura connect- ing the lower lobe with the side of the pericardium, which is called the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The pleura will be seen to be reflected on the upper surface of the diaphragm below, and to be prolonged in a conical form above the first rib, where it may be felt in relation with the subclavian artery. The diaphragm rises higher on the right side than on the left, owing to the presence of the liver, and the heart has a direction to the left; hence the right bag of the pleura is the wider whilst the left is the longer of the two, and the lungs correspond in shape. The Mediastina (Fig. 225), are the spaces between the pleurae and are three in number, anterior, middle, and posterior. The Anterior Mediastinum, which is now exposed, is the small space bounded by the sternum in front, the pericardium behind, and430 THE THORAX. the pleura at the sides, and is placed a little to the left of the median line. It contains (1) the triangularis sterni muscle ; (2) the origins of the sterno-hvoid and sterno-thyroid muscles; (3) the remains oi the thymus gland (a ductless gland largely developed m the foetus); (4) Fig. 225. the Ufi internal mammary vessels ; some cellular tissue and a few 17 The ^Middle Mediastinum is the space between the two lungs and contains therefore (1) the heart and large vessels, (2) the pericardium, (3) the roots of the lungs, and (4) the phrenic nerves. The Posterior Mediastinum is behind the pericardium, and will be afterwards dissected. It contains (1) the thoracic aorta, (2) the JraSL, (3) the oesophagus withjthe^pueuroo^^ -^^glj^ the thorax (altered from 1 Anterior mediastinum. 2 Internal mammary vessels. 3* Triangularis sterni muscle. 4 Bight phrenic nerve between pleura and pericardium. 5.

[To examine the middle mediastinum, the ribs should be divided about three inches from their cartilages, and the pieces turned back to give more room, but care should be taken to divide the first and second ribs in front of the attachments of the scaleni muscles. The lungs are to be drawn away from the heart, and the layer of pleura reflected on the pericardium is then to be carefully removed (the phrenic nerves lying between the two being preserved), and the roots of the lungs cleaned without injuring the pericardium.] The Pericardium (Fig. 225) is a hbro-serous membrane inclosing the heart and is of conical shape, the base being at the diaphragm and the apex lost in the great vessels, where it is incorporated with a process of the deep cervical fascia, which serves to maintain the position of the heart. The fibrous layer is pierced by and gives an investment to all the vessels connected with the heart, except the inferior vena cava, which pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm within the line at which the fibres of the pericardium are incorpo- rated with those of the central tendon of the diaphragm. The serous lining consists of a parietal and a visceral layer, the former being in- separably united with the fibrous layer, and the latter covering the heart and being reflected on all the vessels for a short distance, but binding the aorta and the pulmonary artery together in a single tube of membrane. The Phrenic Nerves (Fig. 225, 4, 5) will be seen in the whole of their course, and should be carefully preserved. Arising from the 4th and 5th cervical nerves, and frequently by a small branch from the 3rd, they lie on the scaleni antici muscles in the neck, and then to the inner sides of those muscles upon the subclavian arteries. The two nerves enter the thorax on each side, and passing between the subclavian vein and artery, cross the internal mammary arteries from without inwards. The left phrenic nerve is then superficial to the left pneumogastric nerve, and crosses the arch of the aorta inter- nally to it; and both nerves pass in front of the roots of the lungs and between the pleurae and pericardium to the diaphragm, which they pierce and supply, the right having a small ganglion connected with it. The left nerve is longer than, the right, having to pass round the heart to reach the diaphragm, which is lower on the left than the right side. Accompanying each nerve may occasion- ally be seen the small comes nervi phrenici artery from the internal mammary.THE THOEAX. 432 I"The pericardium is to be dissected from the roots of the lungs, ancl entirely removed from the great vessels, except a small piece, which should be left to mark the point at which it was attached to the aorta.] The Roots of the Lungs (Figs. 225 and 226) are each formed by a pulmonary artery, two pulmonary veins, and a bronchus, bound Fig. 226. toother by cellular tissue; together with the smaU bronchial vessels, the pulmonary plexus of the pneumogastric nerve and some lym- phatics The order of the vessels from before backwards on both sides of the body is the same, viz. veins, artery, and bronchus; from Tig. 226 1.

The reason of this difference is, that the left bronchus passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and therefore becomes lower than the pulmonary artery on that side. The right pulmonary vessels pass beneath the arch of the aorta.* The Lungs (Fig. 226) will vary very much, in condition in diffe- rent bodies. If perfectly healthy their surfaces will be smooth, and they will be somewhat contracted, but crepitant throughout. Every variety of disease may be found, the most common being tubercle and abscess in the upper lobes, with adhesion to the wall of the thorax, or pneumonic condensation through more or less of the organ. The lungs of subjects dying in large cities not unfrequently present black pigment in the lung tissue and the lymphatic glands. Each lung has a thin anterior margin and a thicker posterior one, which, lies against the spinal column, and is longer than the anterior border. The anterior margin of the left lung is notched so as to leave the apex of the heart uncovered. The outer surface of the lung is convex and the inner concave; about the middle of this latter surface, and near the posterior border is a slit, the hilum, at which the root of the lung enters, whilst in front of it is a hollow corresponding to the heart, and larger in the left lung than the right. The base of the lung is moulded to the diaphragm, and is, therefore, lower behind than in front; whilst the apex is rounded and reaches into the neck above the first rib, extending to a point an incli and a half above the clavicle. The right lung is the larger, owing to the direction of the heart to the left, but is shorter than the left, owing to the position of the liver. The left lung is divided into two lobes (upper and lower) by a fissure running obliquely across the external surface, from near the apex to the anterior border ; but the right has three lobes, owing to the existence of a second fissure running hori- zontally forward, from the middle of the first fissure to the anterior margin of the lung. The Heart (Fig. 22*7) is placed obliquely between the lungs, the base being to the right, and the apex to the left side; and resting on the diaphragm, which is now convex (the position of expiration), it is nearly horizontal. The base corresponds to the interval between the 5th and 8th dorsal vertebra?, and the apex beats between the 5th and 6tb ribs, the larger portion of the organ being to the left of the * It may be noticed that the order of structures from before backwards in the root of the lung corresponds to the arrangement in the hilum of the kidnev X vein, artery, ureter. «.iUiitjy, yiz.

The left auriculo-ventricular opening (mitral valve) lies behind the third intercostal space, about one inch to the left of the sternum. The pulmonary semilunar valves lie behind the junction of the third rib of the left side with the sternum. The Fig. 227 Fie v.i. (to. V. c. parts more'clearly (from Lusclika). Innominate veins.

For purposes of ausculta- tion the usual directions given are, the npper border of the third costal cartilage for the base of the heart, and a spot two inches below the nipple and one to the sternal side for the apex. The weight of the healthy heart averages lloz. in the male and 9oz. in the female. The anterior surface of the heart is convex, and is formed almost entirely by the right ventricle and auricular appendage, but the irregular border of the left auricular appendage appears to the left of the pulmonary artery. The posterior surface of the heart is flattened, and is formed by part of the right auricle, and the left auricle and ventricle, which last forms the apex of the heart. Each surface of the heart is grooved vertically and horizontally, marking the divisions between the auricles and ventricles. The anterior ventricular groove is near the left border of the heart, whilst the posterior ventricular groove is to the right, and they thus indicate the obJique position of the septum. In these grooves will be seen the descending branches of the coronary vessels. The Coronary Arteries (right and left) are the first branches of the aorta, and supply the substance of the heart. They are to be found one on either side of the pulmonary artery, with a plexus (coronary) of nerves accompanying each. The left coronary artery runs from right to left in the auriculo- ventricular groove, and gives a large branch to the front of the heart, which appears to the left of the pulmonary artery and runs down the anterior ventricular groove to the apex. The right coronary artery runs from left to right in the auriculo- ventricular groove, and gives a large branch to the back'of the heart, which runs along the septum to the apex. Both the vertical and horizontal branches of the two arteries anastomose, and supply branches freely to the substance of the heart. . '. The Veins of the heart do not correspond precisely to the arteries. The great cardiac vein runs up the anterior ventricular groove with the descending branch of the left coronary artery, but leaves it to pass along the horizontal auriculo-ventricular groove to the back of the heart. It becomes considerably enlarged and is then called the coronary sinus, and after receiving the posterior cardiac veins from the back of the heart, opens into the back of the right auricle. Some small anterior cardiac veins and other small veins called the venre cordis minima pass directly into the right auricle. The superficial cardiac plexus of the sympathetic is situated P j 243G THE THORAX. immediately, below the arch of the aorta, and gives branches to the front and back of the heart, which, are seldom seen. To it may be traced the left superficial cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, a cardiac branch from the left pneumogastric, and branches from the deep cardiac plexus. . The Great Vessels of the Heart (Fig. 226) have the following positions. The vena cava superior is to the right, and the pulmo- nary artery to the left, whilst between them the arch of the aorta is seen. The inferior vena cava can be seen piercing the diaphragm at the back of the heart, by drawing the organ upwards. _ The Cavities of the heart are to be opened in situ, and in the order in which the blood enters them. TThe right auricle is to be opened by one incision from the superior to the inferior vena cava, and another at right angles to it into the auricular appendage.] Bight Auricle (Fig. 228, ij.—The main cavity of the auricle is smooth internally, but in the appendix are the musculi pectinate or muscular bands "resembling a comb." The endocardium or lining membrane of the heart, is seen to be continuous with the lining membrane of the veins, and will be traced subsequently into the £LTt6XX6S The'krge openings into the right auricle are (1) the superior veua cava (3), which enters at the upper and anterior part; (2) tne inferior vena cava (4), which enters at the lower and back part; and (3) the coronary sinus (7), which enters close above (4) the aunculo- ventricular opening (9) and below the Eustachian valve. The foramina Thebesii are numerous small openings which are found in the wall of the auricle, corresponding to the anterior car- diac veins and the vense cordis minima?. The tubercle of Lower is a projection which is occasionally found in the wall of the auricle, between the superior and inferior vense ^The coronary valve (8) (valve of Thebesius) is a thin fold at the orifice of the coronary sinus, which serves to prevent regurgitation into it 111 The Eustachian valve (6) is a semilunar fold placed to the left of the vena cava inferior, and extending between it and the ami ^ ovalis immediately above the opening of coronary «^V^ served in the foetus to direct the current of blood torn ^™ vena cava through the foramen ovale.

' 437 The fossa ovalis and annulus ovalis (5) are remains of foetal structure, found on the inner wall of the right auricle, in the position of the foramen ovale, or communication between the two • auricles in the foetus. The annulus ovalis is a muscular ring, which is generally well marked, and which surrounds the shallow fossa ovalis, formed by a thin membrane thrown across the foramen ovale. This membrane is Fig. 228. Fig. 228.—Right side of the heart laid open (from Wilson). 1. Cavity of light auricle. 2. Auricular appendix : in its cavity are seen the musculi pectinati. 3.

After birth the aperture gradually becomes obliterated, but not unfrequently a small oblique opening will be found, through which a probe can be introduced. [To open the right ventricle, its flaccid wall should be grasped with the left hand and the scalpel made to transfix it about half-way down, and well to the right side of the septum ; the knife being then carried towards the apex, the cavity of the ventricle will be opened. The left forefinger is to be passed up into the pulmonary artery, and will serve to guide the incision, winch is to be pro- longed into that vessel if possible between two of the_ semilunar valves. All clots being removed, the whole of the ventricle will be displayed.] The Right Ventricle (Fig. 228, a) consists of a main cavity, the walls of which are irregular, owing to the projections of the mus- cular substance of the heart; and of a smooth funnel-shaped portion (infundibulum or conus arteriosus) leading upwards and to the left, into the pulmonary artery. The projections on the wall of the ventricle are the columnoe carnece (h) (fleshy columns) of which three varieties are described : one in which the column merely stands out in relief, being attached to the wall of the ventricle in its whole length ; a second in which the column is attached at both ends but is free in the middle, so that a probe may be passed between it and the waU ; and a third variety called the musculi papillares (gj. These last project into the cavity of the ventricle and give attach- ment by their extremities to the chord® tendinem, or fibrous cords attached to the flaps of the auriculo-ventricular valve. The right auriculo-ventricular valve (e) consists of three portions, and is hence called tricuspid. The flaps are formed by a reduplica- tion of the endocardium or lining membrane of the heart, between the layers of which are some tendinous and muscular fibres, the former being continuous with the chorda? tendinese. The entire valve is attached above to a fibrous ring (zona tendinosa), which bounds the auriculo-ventricular opening, and is divided below into three portions, anterior, posterior, and internal.* The anterior division of the valve is the largest and is in contact * Tho tricuspid valvo is very irregular in its divisions, ^fj?^^ of only two flaps like the mitral valve, and at others hemg divided into torn or even six small portions.THE RIGHT VENTRICLE. 439 with the anterior wall, whilst the posterior flap lies against the posterior wall, which is formed by the posterior part of the septum ventriculorum. The internal or left flap, which is the smallest of the three, shuts off the infundibulum from the general cavity of the ventricle. The auricular surface of the tricuspid valve is extremely smooth, for the purpose of facilitating the flow of blood into the ventricles ; whilst the surface which corresponds to the walls of the ventricle is- remarkably rough, from the prominences formed by the attachments of the chordae tendinese. The tricuspid valve acts during contraction of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle; though even in health there is said to be a slight reflux, which has been termed the "safety-valve action" (King.) The internal division of the tricuspid valve serves to prevent the blood from flowing into the pulmonary artery, until the ventricle is fully distended and able to contract forcibly on its contents. The pulmonary artery is attached to a fibrous ring, which inter- venes between it and the muscular substance of the heart, but the lining membrane of the artery is continuous with that of the ventricle. The semilunar valves (m) of the pulmonary artery, two anterior and one posterior, are three reduplications of the lining membrane, strengthened by fibrous tissue wmich is collected principally at the attached border of each valve, the thin portion near the free border where the fibrous tissue is absent being called the lunula. The attached border is convex, and is fixed to the wall of the artery ; the free border is sub-divided into two slightly concave portions by a little fibrous body, called the corpus Arantii. The semilunar valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent the regurgitation of the blood from the pulmonary artery. The blood (which is venous or dark-coloured) is carried by the pulmonary artery to its bifurcation, and then by the right and left pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is aerated ; and is brought back to the heart by the four pulmonary veins as arterial or red blood. The pulmonary veins open into the left auricle. [The left auricle is to be opened by one incision on its posterior aspect, placed vertically midway between the pulmonary veins and another into the auricular appendage. The heart must be drawn well over to the right side to expose the cavity properly. ]440 THE THORAX. The Left Auricle (Fig. 229, i) closely resembles the right auricle, hut is altogether on a smaller scale, and its border is thinner and more " crenate " than on the opposite side. The openings are those of the four pulmonary veins, two on each side, and the left auriculo- ventricular opening. Fig. 229. The musculi pectinati of the auricular appendix are like those of the right side but smaller, and on the septum of the auricles will be seen the annulus ovalis and fossa ovalis corresponding to those on the right side, but the ring of muscular fibre is not so well developed. [To open the left ventricle, the left forefinger should be intro- duced through the auriculo-ventricular opening, and the knife thrust through the wall of the ventricle near the apex to meet it.

The finger is next to be passed from below into the aorta, followed by the knife, which is to be carried through the front wall of the ventricle close to the septum, thus isolating the right flap of the mitral valve. The incision is to be prolonged into the aorta between two of the semilunar valves, and it will be found to be necessary to divide the pulmonary artery which lies in front of the aorta, but care should be taken to do so above the pulmonary semilunar valves.] The Left Ventricle (Fig. 229, 8) resembles the right, but its wall is thicker and its cavity reaches to the apex of the heart. The columnce carnece, musculi papillares, and cliorclce tendinece resemble those of the right side, but are more fully developed. The left auriculo-ventricular valve consists of two portions, and is hence called bicuspid, or (from the resemblance to a mitre) mitral. The flaps of the valve are composed of the lining membrane of the heart, strengthened by tendinous fibres derived from the chordse tendinese like those on the right side, and are attached to the fibrous ring bounding the auriculo-ventricular opening. The right flap of the valve is anterior to the left flap, and is placed between the cavity of the ventricle and the orifice of the aorta, against which it lies during diastole of the ventricle. It is perfectly smooth on both surfaces, so as not to impede the current of blood into the aorta, thus differing from the left flap, of which the surface next to the wall of the heart is rough (Power). Between the anterior flap of the mitral valve and the aortic valves is a small space with aponeurotic walls— the intervalvular space of Sibson—which receives the aortic valves when distended in " diastole." The mitral valve acts during contraction of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle. The anterior division of the mitral valve prevents the blood from flowing into the aorta, until the ventricle is fully distended and able to contract forcibly on its contents; and the pressure of the blood in the intervalvular space on the anterior flap of the mitral valve keeps the latter closed up to the end of the " systole " or contraction of the ventricle. The closure of the mitral valve accompanies the " first sound " of the heart, which is best heard at the apex. A bruit caused by disease of the valve would be heard in the same situation (Fig. 227, l.v.), and, if systolic, depends upon regurgitation through the valve, if diastolic upon roughness of the surface over which the blood passes from the auricle.442 THE THORAX. A fibrous ring intervenes between the muscular tissue of the heart and the aorta, the lining membrane of which is continuous with the endocardium. The Aortic semilunar valves resemble those of the pulmonary- artery but are more fully developed, and the corpora Arantii are better seen than on the right side. The aortic valves occupy a position the converse of those of the pulmonary artery, viz. one in Fi". 230. front and two behind ; and above each of the three valves there is a dilatation of the aorta, called the aortic sinus, or sinus of Valsalva. At the bottom of the anterior and left posterior sinuses will be seen the orifices of the coronary arteries, the first branches of the aorta. The aortic valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent regurgitation into the ventricle, their closure accom- panying the " second sound " of the heart, which is best heard over the base of the heart and on the sternum opposite the second inter- costal space (Fig. 227, ao.). If from disease of the valves their closure is not perfect and regurgitation occurs, a " diastolic aortic bruit is produced : if the surfaces of the valves should be so roughened as to Fig. 230 —A section of the heart at the level of the valves, seen from above (from Sibson's Medical Anatomy).

A horizontal section above the valves (Fig. 231) shows their relation to one another. The left ventricle occupies the posterior aspect of the heart, and the mitral orifice and valve are therefore behind. In front of this is the aortic orifice, separated only by a fibrous septum. To the left of the aorta, and a little in front, is the pulmonary artery, with its valves, and to the right is the tricuspid or right auriculo-ventricular valve. The Foetal Circulation (Fig. 231).—This will be the best opportunity for contrast- ing the adult circulation with that of the foetus. In the foetus the blood is brought from the placenta by the um- bilical vein, which enters the body at the umbilicus. It then passes along the longitudinal fissure of the liver, and at the transverse fissure divides into Fig. 231.—Diagram of the Foetal circulation (from Wilson). 7. 8. 9. 10.

In the inferior vena cava the placental blood is joined by that returned from the lower extremities, and afterwards, through the hepatic veins, by that circulated through the liver; and is then poured into the right auricle. The Eustachian valve, of large size in the foetus, directs the current across the auricle to the foramen ovale, which is patent, and the blood enters the left auricle. From the left auricle the blood necessarily passes into the left ventricle, and is thence propelled through the aorta to the head and upper extremities. From these it is returned by the superior vena cava, which enters the upper part of the right auricle, and the blood descends at once into the right ventricle, thus taking a course at right angles to the former one. From the right ventricle the blood is propelled into the pulmonary artery, and a small portion reaches the lungs through the right and left pulmonary arte- ries, but by far the larger portion passes through the ductus arteriosus (a short tube connected with the pulmonary artery close to the bifur- cation), and enters the descending portion of the arch of the aorta. Through the aorta the blood reaches the iliac arteries, and a small portion passes by the external iliacs to the lower extremities, but the rest passes by the internal iliacs to the hypogastric arteries, which run to the umbilicus and then wind round the umbilical vein to the placenta, under the name of umbilical arteries. The Pulmonary Artery (Fig. 232, 13) has already been seen to arise from the right ventricle and to lie in front of the aorta. It then passes to the left side of the aorta, where it bifurcates into right and left pulmonary arteries, which go to their respective lungs ; the right being the longer of the two and necessarily passing beneath the arch of the aorta, and the left crossing the descending aorta. The position of each of the arteries in the root of the lung has been already seen, the right being below and the left above its bronchus. . Connecting the pulmonary artery with the descending portion ot the arch of the aorta is a fibrous cord, externally to which the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the left side passes from the trunk of the pneumo- gastric. This is the obliterated ductus arteriosus, which in the foetus is a vessel nearly as large as the aorta, passing from the left division of the pulmonary artery to the arch of the aorta just beyond the left; subclavian. The Pulmonary Veins (Fig. 232, 19) are four in number, two to each lung. Their positions in the roots of the lungs have been seen, and they have been traced to the left auricle of the heart. The ngntTHE ARCH OF THE AORTA. 445 veins are the longer and pass beneath the arch of the aorta,, the left veins crossing the descending aorta. The Arch of the Aorta (Fig. 232)—The aorta has been seen to arise from the left ven- tricle, and it at first takes a course upwards and to the right side, but then backwards and to the left, thus forming an arch. For convenience of descrip- tion the arch is divided into three portions— ascending, horizontal or transverse, and de- scending. 1. The ascending 'por- tion (i), beginning op- posite the third costal cartilage of the left side, reaches as high as the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side close to the sternum. It is almost entirely enclosed within the pericardium, and is crossed at first by the pulmonary artery. In front of the pericardium are the sternum and both pleurae ; behind the ascending aorta is the right Eig. 232.—Diagram of the large vessels of the heart and lungs (from Wilson). 1.

Its branches are the two coronary arteries, which have been already traced. 2. The horizontal or transverse portion has a direction backwards and to the left side, reaching from the second costal cartilage of the right side to the left side of the fourth dorsal vertebra. In front of this portion are the sternum and left pleura, and, from left to right, the left pneumogastric with the small cardiac nerves and the left phrenic nerve ; behind are the trachea, the oesophagus and thoracic duct, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Above is the left innominate vein ; and below are the left bronchus and the bifurca- tion of the pulmonary artery, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the obliterated ductus arteriosus. The branches of this portion are the innominate, the left carotid, and the left subclavian arteries. 3. The descending portion extends to the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra, where the descending thoracic aorta begins, but the division between the two vessels is arbitrary. It is invested almost entirely by the left pleura, which binds it to the side of the vertebrte. The Vena Cava Superior (Fig. 227 v.c.) is formed by the junction of the right and left brachio-cephalic or irmominate veins, on the right of the innominate artery. The vena cava receives the vena azygos major just above the pericardium, and then, piercing the pericardium, passes in front of the root of the right lung to enter the upper part of the right auricle. Note.—The levels of the aorta here given are lower than those ordinarily laid down but are the result of numerous independent observations by the author, and by Professor Wood, who originally investigated the subject, and -whose paper, in the Journal of Anatomy for December, 1868, may be consulted with advantage. Great Vessels of the Eoot of the Neck. The three great branches of the second part of the arch of the aorta are the Innominate, the Left Carotid, and the Left Subclavian The Innominate Artery (Fig. 232, 4) passes upwards and to the right side, and at the sterno-clavicular articulation divides into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. It has in front of it the upper piece of the sternum, with the remains of the thymus gland, and the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles; and is crossed nearly at right angles by the left brachio- cephalic or innominate vein, and obliquely by the right inferior thyroid vein. Behind it at first is the trachea, but afterwards the447 THE RIGHT INNOMINATE VEIN. prolongation of the right pleura into the neck. To the right side are the right innominate vein and right phrenic nerve; to the left side, the origin of the left common carotid, and afterwards the trachea. The. innominate artery ordinarily gives off no branch, hut occasion- ally a small branch (thyroidea ima, middle thyroid artery of Harrison) arises from it or from the aorta close to it, and runs np the front of the trachea to the thyroid body. The Left Common Carotid Artery (Fig. 232, n).—The left common carotid runs upwards and to the left side, at a level anterior to that of the left subclavian artery, and from the left sterno- clavicular articulation its relations correspond to those of the right carotid artery (p. 331). The thoracic portion has in front of it the upper piece of the sternum, with the remains of the thymus gland, and the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles ; and is crossed by the left innominate vein. It lies against the trachea at first, and then upon the oesophagus and thoracic duct ; having the innominate artery, the trachea, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve to its right side, and the left pneumogastric nerve with its cardiac branches, the left sub- clavian artery and the pleura to its left side. The Left Subclavian Artery (Fig. 232, 12) extends from the arch of the aorta to the inner border of the scalenus anticus, and may be conveniently divided into a thoracic and a cervical portion. The thoracic portion is nearly vertical in its direction, and lies to the left side of, but in a plane posterior to that of, the left carotid artery. It is crossed by the left innominate vein and by the left pneumogastric and cardiac nerves; it lies against the spine; with the oesophagus and thoracic duct to the right side, and the pleura to the left. Irregularities of the Great Vessels.—The number and position of the branches of the arch of the aorta are subject to variation. The commonest variety is for the left carotid to arise from the innominate, thus reducing the branches to two ; but four branches may be due to the right carotid and subclavian arising separately from the arch. Occasionally when four branches are present, the right subclavian arises from the extreme left of the arch, and passes to the right side in front of or behind the oesophagus. The left vertebral artery not unfrequently arises from the aorta between the left carotid and left subclavian; and the thyroidea ima may occasionally arise from the arch. The Right Innominate Vein (Fig. 227) commences atj;he inner end of the clavicle by the junction of the subclavian and. internal jugular veins, and then descends on the outer side of the innominate448 THE THORAX.

It is closely invested by the right pleura, and has the phrenic nerve on its outer side. The Left Innominate Vein (Fig. 235) commencing at a corre- sponding point to and in the same way as the right vein, runs obliquely downwards and to the right side, lying just above the level of the arch of the aorta and crossing its large branches. It unites with the right innominate vein on the right of the sternum, between the cartilages of the first and second ribs, to form the vena cava superior (p. 446). Branches.—Each innominate vein receives the internal mammary, the inferior thyroid, and the superior intercostal branches. The left vein receives in addition small thymic and pericardiac branches. [The ascending portion of the arch of the aorta and the vense cavse are to be divided, and the remains of the heart removed with the pulmonary vessels, which are to be cut close to the lungs. The arch of the aorta is to be held to one side by hooks, and the bifurcation of the trachea with the deep cardiac plexus dissected out.] The Deep Cardiac Plexus (Fig. 233) is situated on each side of the trachea close to its bifurcation. The right half of the plexus receives all the cardiac nerves of that side, viz., three cardiac nerves from the three cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, the three cardiac branches of the pneumo-gastric, and the cardiac branch of its recur- rent laryngeal nerve. The branches of this half of the plexus are distributed to the right side of the heart and the right lung, and many of them have been necessarily destroyed. The left half (Fig. 234) of the plexus receives the same nerves as the right, with the exception of the superior cardiac nerve of the sympathetic and the inferior cardiac branch of the pneumo-gastric, which have been 7.

The branches of this half of the plexus are distributed to the left side of the heart and the left lung, and also communicate with the superficial cardiac plexus. The Trachea (Fig. 233, 24) is now sufficiently exposed for the examination of its relations, but its structure will be given with that of the lungs. The trachea extends from the lower border of the larynx, about the level of the fifth cervical vertebra, to the level of the fifth dorsal vertebra, where it bifurcates into the bronchi. The trachea occupies the middle line, lying in front of the oesophagus and vertebral column, and has the following structures in front of it in the neck : the sterno-hyoid and -thyroid muscles with the deep cervical fascia ; the isthmus of the thyroid body with the inferior thyroid veins ; and the arteria thyroidea ima from the innominate, • if it exists. In the thorax it lies in the posterior mediastinum, and has in front the sternum with the remains of the thymus gland; the arch of the aorta and the nerves crossing it; the innominate and left carotid arteries (for a very short distance); and the left innominate vein. The Right Bronchus (Fig. 231, 17) is larger than the left, and has been seen to be posterior and superior to the pulmonary vessels in the root of the lung. It is about one inch long, and takes a more horizontal course than the left. The vena azygos major hooks round the right bronchus to open into the vena cava. The Left Bronchus (Fig. 231, 18) is nearly twice as long as the right, and takes an oblique course beneath the arch of the aorta, crossing the oesophagus and the descending aorta, and lying posterior to, but being visible between, the pulmonary artery and veins (p. 432). The Thyroid Body (Fig. 234, 19) has been seen incidentally 111 the dissection of the neck, but is now fully exposed for examination It consists of two symmetrical conical lobes, placed on each side of the upper part of the trachea, and united opposite the second and third rings of the trachea by the isthmus. The lobes are subject to great variations in size, and when much hypertrophied constitute Bronchocele or Goitre. The thyroid body is covered by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-tnyroid muscles, and occasionally a few muscular fibres pass from the hyoid bone to the isthmus, constituting the levator glandular thyroidece oi Soemmering. It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior thyroid and inferior thyroid arteries of each side, and occasionally by an additional branch from the innominate. The arteries freely anastomose in the substance of the body, and return their blood by three veins on each side, viz., the superior and middle thyroid, which join the internal jugular vein, and the interior451 THE (ESOPHAGUS. thyroid, which, has been traced down the front of the trachea to the innominate vein. The thyroid body is composed of numerous closed vesicles contain- ing a yellow fluid, but its function is not understood. [The right lung is to be drawn forward, and the pleura divided where it is reflected from the lung to the wall of the thorax, and the parts in the posterior mediastinum are to be cleaned. The muscular oesophagus will be at once seen, and the right pneumo-gastric nerve is to be traced to it and to the back of the right bronchus. On displacing the oesophagus the side of the descending thoracic aorta will come into view, but it will be better seen in the dissection of the left side. The vena azygos major will be seen to the right of the aorta, and between the two will be found the slender and collapsed thoracic duct. The intercostal vessels will be seen crossing the back of the space, and near the diaphragm will be found the splanchnic nerves from the sympathetic cord, which is itself outside the mediastinum.] The Posterior Mediastinum (Fig. 225) is the interpleural space behind the pericardium, bounded by the vertebra? behind, the peri- cardium in front, and the reflection of the pleura on each side. It contains the trachea, oesophagus, and the two pneumo-gastric nerves; the descending thoracic aorta, vena azygos major and thoracic duct; and, at the lower part, the great splanchnic nerve with some areolar tissue and lymphatic glands. The (Esophagus (Fig. 233, 29) is a muscular tube continuous with the pharynx. It begins opposite the 5th cervical vertebra, and can now be seen to lie to the left side of the median line in the neck. It then passes through the superior aperture of the thorax, being in re- lation with the left common carotid artery, and reaches the front of the spine, passing behind the arch of the aorta and being crossed by the left bronchus. It is now seen to pass in front of the descending thoracic aorta, which it crosses very obliquely, to reach the left side and pass through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, opposite the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra. The oesophagus is from nine to ten inches in length, and consists of two layers of muscular fibres, the outer longitudinal and the inner circular, which are of the striped variety in the upper part, but of the unstriped variety in the lower part of the tube. Within the muscular coats are a delicate fibrous coat and a simple mucous membrane with tesselated epithelium, which is thrown into longitudinal folds when the oesophagus is not distended with food. The long meshes of nerve upon the oesophagus are derived from the two pneumo-gastrics and form the plexus qulaz. G 6 2452 THE THORAX. Fig. 234. L Gasserian ganglion of 5th nerye. 2. Internal carotid artery.453 THE THORACIC DUCT. The Thoracic Duct (Fig. 235, 13) is a delicate tube about eighteen, inches long, embedded in loose tissue between the aorta and the vena azygos major. By cutting away the remains of the diaphragm care- fully, it may be traced from the receptaculum chyli (12) opposite the second lumbar vertebra, and will be found to pass through the aortic opening to the right side of the aorta. It continues to the right of the aorta, lying between it and the vena azygos, as high as the fourth dorsal vertebra, and then crosses obliquely to the left of the spine behind the arch of the aorta, and runs along the left side of the oeso- phagus through the superior aperture of the thorax. In the neck the duct reaches as high as the sixth cervical vertebra, and then, crossing the left vertebral artery and thyroid axis, curves downwards in front of the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve, to enter the left subclavian vein at its junction with the left internal jugular. The duct occa- sionally passes higher in the neck, and opens into the jugular at the point where some irregular vein joins it. The duct is dilated near its termination, and is often double both there and in the thorax. It has valves at various points, and by opening the subclavian vein a pair may be found at its entrance into the vein, which prevent the reflux of blood into the duct. Between the ribs close to the vertebrae, some intercostal lymphatic glands may be found, which open into the duct. (Esophageal and bronchial glands may also be seen in connection with the tubes of the same name. 3. Pharyngeal branch of pneumo- gastric. 4. Glossopharyngeal nerve. 5. Lingual nerve (5th). 6.

The Vena Azygos Major (Fig. 236, 15) commences in one of the lumbar veins, and is to be traced through the aortic' orifice of the dia- phragm. It lies to the right of the thoracic duct upon the vertebrae, cross- ing the right intercostal arteries, and receiving directly or indirectly all the right intercostal veins except the first. About the level of the seventh dorsal vertebra it receives the vena azygos minor, passing from the left side be- hind the aorta, and very generally a vertebra or two higher receives the vena azygos superior from the left side. It lastly arches forward over the right bronchus, and after receiving the right bronchial vein, opens into the superior vena cava just outside the pericar- dium. Frequently the superior inter- costal vein communicates with the vena azygos close to its termina- tion. The azygos veins contain some im- perfect valves, and form an important communication between the superior and inferior vena? cava?. The Right Pneunio - Gastric Nerve (Fig. 233, 6) has been seen to enter the thorax between the sub- Fig. 235.—The course and termination of Arch of the aorta. _ Descending thoracic aorta.

It is now seen to run backward to the right side of the trachea, along which it passes to the bifurcation, to form the posterior pulmonary plexus at the back of the right bronchus. The nerve then supplies the oesophagus, form- ing, with the nerve of the opposite side, a plexus of long meshes which has been called the plexus gules. Lastly the right nerve reaches the back of the stomach. Cardiac branches from the trunk of the pneumo-gastric nerve and from its recurrent laryngeal branch arise in the thorax, and the cervi- cal cardiac branches may also be traced out, and will be afterwards seen to join the deep cardiac plexus. [The left lung is now to be drawn forward, and the pleura removed in the same manner as on the right side. The oesophagus with branches from the left pneumo-gastric will be seen near the dia- phragm, and upon displacing it, the descending thoracic aorta will be brought into view with the left splanchnic nerves and vena azygos minor.] The Left Pneumo-Gastric Nerve (Fig. 234, 31) enters the thorax between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and passes behind the left innominate vein. It then crosses the arch of the aorta, around which it gives its recurrent branch (21), and can now be traced to the back of the left bronchus, where it breaks up into numerous branches to the left lung and, after giving branches to the oesophagus which unite with those of the opposite side in the plexus gulce, terminates on the anterior surface of the stomach. From the left recurrent branch cardiac nerves pass to the deep cardiac plexus. The Descending Thoracic Aorta (Fig. 234, 32) is the con- tinuation of the arch of the aorta, and extends from the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra to the twelfth dorsal vertebra, opposite which it passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm to be- come the abdominal aorta. In its course it lies at first to the left, but afterwards in front of, the bodies. of the vertebrae, crossing the vena azygos minor. It is crossed by the root of the left lung and, very obliquely, by the oesophagus, which overlies it near the diaphragm. The artery has the thoracic duct and the vena azygos major to its right side, and is closely invested by the pleura on the left side. Branches.—From the front of the aorta pericardiac, bronchial, ceso- phageal and mediastinal branches are given off, which can now be seen. From the back part of the aorta the right and left intercostal arteries arise, which will be afterwards traced.457 THE AOKTIC INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES. a. The pericardiac "branches are irregular. 6 The bronchial arteries, one or two to each lung, run on the pos- terior surface of each bronchus and supply blood to the tissues of the luncrs. A bronchial vein accompanies each artery ; the right opening into the vena azygos major, and the left into the left superior inter- costal vein. c. The oesophageal arteries are four or five small branches to the gullet. d. The mediastinal are small twigs to the cellular tissue and glands of the posterior mediastinum. They anastomose with the pericardiac and oesophageal arteries, and form part of the sub-pleural mediastinal plexus of Turner. [The trachea is to be cut just above the bifurcation, and the lungs are then to be removed from the chest and kept for subsequent examination. The intercostal vessels, the azygos veins, and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic with its branches are now to be dissected out by removing the pleura, and opportunity may be taken to follow out the thoracic duct, if this was not done satisfac- torily before.] The Aortic Intercostal Arteries (Fig. 236) are nine or ten in number on each side, and arise from the back part of the aorta. They supply the nine lower intercostal spaces, anastomosing with the superior intercostal artery above, and the arteries of the right side are necessarily longer than those of the left, owing to the position of the aorta to the left side of the median line. The upper arteries necessarily ascend to reach their proper intercostal spaces, but the lower ones run transversely, passing beneath the oesophagus, thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and gangliated cord of the sympathetic on Ei°\ 236.—Veins of the trunk and neck (from Cruveilhier). 1.

Each artery gives off a posterior branch close to the vertebra?, which passes backwards between the transverse processes to the muscles of the back, giving off a small spinal branch through the intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and body of each vertebra (Fig. 225). The intercostal arteries lie against the external intercostal muscles at first, and are only covered by pleura. A vein and nerve are in relation with each artery, the vein being highest and the nerve lowest in most of the spaces, but the artery being below the nerve at first in the three or four upper spaces. The arteries then disappear beneath the internal intercostals, by the removal of one or two of which the vessels and nerves can be traced out. The artery soon reaches the lower border of the adjacent rib, along the groove in which it runs, being thus protected from injury in the operation of paracentesis thoracis. Lateral and anterior cutaneous branches are given off by both arteries and nerves, which have been already seen. The Intercostal Veins (Fig. 236) open into the azygos veins on each side. The vena azygos major of the right side has been already seen. The Vena Azygos Minor (Fig. 236, 18) commencing in the left lumbar veins (and often in the renal), pierces the left crus of the dia- phragm and receives the lower intercostal veins of the left side ; it has been seen to pass behind the aorta and open into the vena azygos major. The upper intercostal veins of the left side either open into the superior intercostal vein, or form a separate vein (vena azygos minor superior) which, communicating with the superior intercostal vein above, either terminates below in the vena azygos minor, or crosses the spine separately to open into the vena azygos major. The Intercostal Nerves (Fig. 234) are twelve in number and, with the exception of the first, accompany the intercostal arteries, and are distributed to the front and sides of the chest. The first nerve gives only a small branch to the first intercostal space, and then passes through the superior aperture of the thorax to join the brachial plexus. The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 233, 31) is placed over the heads of the ribs on each side of the thorax, just out- side the posterior mediastinum and beneath the pleura, being conti- nuous with the cervical portion of the sympathetic, the inferior cervical ganglion of which should now be dissected on the neck of the first rib.UPPER SURFACE OF THE DIAPHRAGM. The thoracic ganglia are generally said to correspond to the ribs in number, but there is seldom a distinct ganglion for the first rib, it being united with the inferior cervical ganglion; and occasionally two of the lower ganglia are united. The inferior cervical ganglion has branches of communication with the two lowest cervical nerves, and gives branches upon the vertebral artery, and an inferior cardiac nerve to the deep cardiac plexus (Fig. 234). The thoracic ganglia may be divided into two sets, upper and lower. From the six upper ganglia communicating branches are given to the six upper intercostal nerves, and to the pulmonary and aortic plexuses. From the six lower ganglia branches of communication are given to the six lower intercostal nerves, and the three splanchnic nerves arise. There are generally two branches of communication between each ganglion and an intercostal nerve, one grey and one white. Splanchnic Nerves (Fig. 233, 43).—The great splanchnic nerve is derived from four ganglia (7th, 8th, 9th, 10th) by separate fibres. The nerve runs inwards and thus enters the lower part of the medi- astinum, and, after piercing the cms of the diaphragm, joins the solar plexus in the abdomen. The lesser splanchnic nerve is derived from the 10th and 11th ganglia, and also pierces the cms of the diaphragm to join the solar or renal plexus. The least splanchnic nerve is derived from the 12th ganglion, and goes to the renal plexus. It is seldom found, because the lesser nerve is connected with the lowest ganglion. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 236) can be seen be- neath the pleura without any further dissection. Beginning at the sternum the muscles reach as far as the angles of the ribs, at which points the intercostal vessels and nerves lying against the external intercostals are visible. The fibres of the internal intercostals take a direction contrary to that of the external intercostal muscles, i.e., they run forwards and upwards. The relation of the parts passing through the Superior Aperture of the Thorax can be now fully understood, and will be found in the following table and the accompanying diagram taken from nature (Fig. 237). The Upper Surface of the Diaphragm (Fig. 238) will now also be thoroughly exposed, the structures in relation with it having been already dissected; but these should be again carefully studied in con- nection with the muscle.460 THE THORAX. [The lungs, which have been removed and laid aside, are now to be dissected,'and the structure of the trachea and lungs is to be examined.] The Trachea is about four inches and a half in length, and is con- vex in front, but flattened posteriorly, being composed of a series Fig. 237.

Within this again is a longitudinal layer of elastic fibres closely con- nected with the mucous membrane, the epithelium of which is columnar and ciliated. On looking into the lower end of the trachea, a slight septum will be seen between the two bronchi but placed to the left of the median line, thus favouring the passage of foreign bodies into the right bronchus, the orifice of which is seen to be larger than that of the left. IThe trachea and bronchi are to be laid open from behind with scissors, and the divisions of the bronchi should be followed for a short distance into the substance of the lungs.] The Lungs.—The mucous membrane of the air tubes is of a pinkish colour and has ciliated epithelium. Numerous mucous glands are embedded in the submucous areolar tissue. On tracing the bronchi they will be found to divide (for the most Fig. 239. Fig. 240.

The muscular fibres, which were only at the back of the large bronchi, surround the smaller tubes, and can be traced further than the car- tilages. The fibrous and elastic coats may be traced into the smallest ramifications of the air-tubes, which thus become eventually membra- nous. The minute bronchia terminate in intercellular passages, in which the mucous membrane is covered with squamous epithelium. Opening out of the intercellular passages are the air-cells, or alveoli, the average diameter of which is -j-^-oth of an inch, and the septa be- tween which are formed by reduplica- tions of the lining membrane. (Fig. 241). Fig. 241. The air-cells collected around the ex- tremity of each minute bronchial tube form a lobule or infunclibulum, and these aggregated together form the substance of the lung, but the air-cells of one lobule have no connection with those of another. (Fig. 239). The pulmonary artery subdivides like the bronchus which it accompanies, giving a branch to each lobule, which ends in a plexus of capillaries distributed beneath the mucous membrane of the air-cells and their septa, and also on the walls of the inter- cellular passages; the capillaries of each lobule being distinct (Fig. 240). The pulmonary veins convey the arterialised blood from the lobules, and correspond to the branches of the arteries. They have no valves, and the veins of different lobules anastomose freely. The bronchial arteries, arising from the thoracic aorta, may be traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance. They supply the substance of the lung, and their blood is returned partly by the bronchial veins and partly by the pulmonary veins. The bronchial veins open on the right side into the vena azygos, and on the left usually into the superior intercostal vein.

They can be traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance, and are said to have minute ganglia developed upon them. The lymphatics of the lung are connected with the bronchial glands found about the bifurcation of the trachea. Articulation of the Eibs with the Vertebra. The ligaments of the ribs may be divided into two sets, (1) those connecting the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae (costo-vertebral), and (2) those connecting the ribs with the transverse processes (costo- transverse). 1. The costo-vertebral ligaments are Anterior, Capsular, and lnter- articular. . The Anterior Costo-vertebral or Stellate Ligament (.big. 242, 2) consists of three short fasciculi which radiate from the ante- rior surface of the head of the rib. The superior fasciculus passes to Fig. 242. Fig. 243 "l^rS^Anterior ligament of the vertebrae, and ligaments of the ribs ' (from Wilson). 1. Anterior common JW-t. **&%!&2ff££tt 2.

The whole ligament is closely connected with the anterior common ligament of the vertebrae. This arrangement only holds good in the case of those ribs which articulate with two vertebras. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate with a single vertebra each, the stellate ligament is attached principally to that vertebra, but sends a few fibres to the vertebra above. The Capsular Ligament is a thin layer of fibres surrounding the articulation where the anterior ligament is wanting. The Interarticular Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is seen by removing the stellate ligament, and is a short band passing between the ridge on the head of the rib and the intervertebral substance. It divides the articulation into two parts, each of which has a separate synovial membrane, but it is absent from the articulations of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which have a single synovial membrane. 2. The Costo-transverse ligaments are Anterior, Posterior, and Middle. Fig. 244. The Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 3) is attached to the upper border of the neck of all the ribs except the first, and ascends to the lower border of the transverse process of the vertebra above. It separates the anterior from the posterior division of the intercostal nerves. The Posterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is a short thick band, passing obliquely upward from the apex of the Fig. 244.—Transverse section of dorsal vertebra and ribs (Quain). 1.

Tin order to see the middle costo-transverse ligament it will be necessary to make a horizontal section through the transverse process of a vertebra and the neck of the corresponding rib, when the short ligament will be found between the two.] The Middle Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 244, 4) consists of short strong fibres passing between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib and the corresponding transverse process. A synovial membrane exists between the facet upon each ot the transverse processes of the ten upper dorsal vertebrae and the articu- lar tubercle of the corresponding rib. # The anterior extremity of each rib has a hollow into which the costal cartilage fits, being firmly united by the periosteum. Chondro-Sternal Articulation.—The cartilages of the true ribs fit into depressions on the side of the sternum, and are attached by anterior and posterior ligaments. A band attaching the seventh rib to the xiphoid cartilage is called the costo-xiphoicl ligament The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth cartilages are connected together by fibrous bands. _ Synovial Membranes.-^ first costal cartilage is continuous with the sternum and has no synovial cavity. The second and tod car- tilages have a double synovial membrane, owing to the existence ot an Particular ligament. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh car- tilages have a single synovial membrane at the external articulation, and there are in addition three synovial membranes between the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth costal cartilages respectively.PAET VI. * ' DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND SPINAL CORD. In dissecting the Back it is customary for the dissectors of'the arms to take the first two lavers of muscles, and the dissectors of the head and neck the remainder of the region, including the spinal cord. [An incision is to be made from the occiput to the sacrum in the median line, and another along each crest of the ilium at right angles to it. The dissectors should then raise the skin with all the infil- trated fascia, going at once down to the superficial muscles, through which the cutaneous nerves appear. On the left side of the subject the arm is to be drawn forward so as to put the latissimus dorsi on the stretch, and the dissector should begin to clean the lower part of that muscle, and work upward to the trapezius ; on the right side the arm should be pulled down at first, and the head drawn over to the opposite side with hooks, to put the upper fibres of the trapezius on the stretch, and the dissector must begin at the upper border of that muscle (already exposed in the posterior triangle) and work down- ward to the latissimus dorsi. On both sides the arm and scapula will require to be moved from time to time to put the different sets of fibres on the stretch in turn.] The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 248) are derived from the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves, and are mostly of small size ; but the upper dorsal nerves reach the shoulder and the lumbar the buttock. The cervical and upper dorsal nerves pierce the trapezius close to the spine, the second and third turning up to the occiput; the lower six dorsal and the lumbar nerves appear near the angles of the ribs and pierce the latissimus dorsi along the oblique line at which the muscular fibres commence ; and the sacral nerves give small branches through the tendinous expansion near the spine. The First Layer of Muscles (Fig. 245) consists of the Trapezius and Latissimus Dorsi. The Trapezius partially overlaps the latissi- mus, but between them and the base of the scapula is a small triangular interval in which the lower fibres of the rhomboideus major can be seen, and also, below that muscle, the posterior surfaces of two or three ribs and their intercostal muscles. H h 2468 THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The Trapezius (Fig. 245, i) of one side is triangular, but the two muscles together resemble a trapezium. It arises from the external Tig. 245. layer occupies 1.

The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle, and into the upper border of the acromion process and spine of the scapula. The fibres thus have different directions, and the action of the muscle upon the scapula is said to vary according to the fibres brought into use. The action of the entire muscle is to draw the scapula towards the spine, and thus the two trapezii throw back the shoulders. When the scapulae are fixed by other muscles, the two trapezii throw the head back, or one muscle acting by itself would draw the head and spine to that side. The trapezius has been seen to be supplied by the spinal-accessory nerve and branches of the deep cervical plexus, it also receives branches from the posterior divisions of the nerves which pierce it. The Ligamentum Nuchce is a band of white fibrous tissue, which extends from the prominent spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital protuberance, being connected by small slips with the spines of the intervening vertebrae. It intervenes between, and gives origin to, the muscles of the two sides of the neck, and in the lower animals, being composed of yellow elastic tissue, it gives an important support to the head. The Latissimus Dorsi (Fig. 245, 4) arises by a tendinous origin from the posterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium and the back of the sacrum ; from all the lumbar and the six lower dorsal spines ; and from the outer surfaces of the three lower ribs, inter- digitating with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The broad muscular fibres become collected together as they wind round the inferior angle of the scapula, to which they sometimes have a slight attachment, and then pass forward and upward in front of the teres major, to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of . the humerus. The fibres of the muscle are twisted, so that those which were highest at their origin are lowest at the insertion and vice versa. The latissimus dorsi, when taking its fixed point below, rotates the humerus inwards and then draws it behind the back, the two muscles, is seen attached to the spinous 18.

When the humerus is fixed, the muscle would draw up the trunk as in climbing, and may act as an extraordinary muscle of inspiration upon the lower ribs. It is supplied by the long subscapular nerve, and by the dorsal nerves which pierce it. [The trapezius is to be divided by a vertical incision near the spine, care being taken not to divide the subjacent tendinous origins of the rhomboidei in the cervical region. In reflecting the trapezius its tendon will be seen to glide over the smooth triangular surface at the inner end of the spine of the scapula. Care must be taken of the spinal-accessory nerve and the accompanying branches of the super- ficial- cervical artery. The posterior surface of the levator anguli scapulas and the two rhomboidei muscles are now to be cleaned.] Second Layer of Muscles. The Levator Anguli Scapulae (Fig. 245,10) arises from the pos- terior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper four cervical vertebras, and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the supraspinous fossa. The anterior surface of this muscle has been seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, where the levator covers the splenius colli muscle. The Rhomboideus Minor (Fig. 245, n) is a narrow muscle arising from the Ugamentum nuchas and from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebras. It is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the spine. The Rhomboideus Major (Fig. 245, 12) arises from the spinous processes of the upper four dorsal vertebras, being often united with the minor; and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the infraspinous fossa, the middle fibres being attached to a fibrous arch, which is connected with the bone at its extremities. The three muscles of the second layer act upon the scapula, the levator drawing up the superior angle, and the rhomboidei taring the lower part of the bone towards the spine, and thus tending to rotate the scapula and depress the glenoid cavity. The muscles are supplied by branches from the upper part of the brachial plexus and twigs from the cervical plexus. TThe posterior belly of the omo-hyoid is to be traced out to the scapula, and the levator, rhomboidei and the upper ha f of the latissimus dorsi are then to be divided, when the scapula can be drawn away from the ribs, and the posterior surface of the seriati s magnus miiscle with a quantity of loose cellular tissue between it and the ribs will be brought into view. This muscle is to be cgviaea by a vertical incision, and the clavicle being sawn through (it tms has not already been done), the arm will be attached only by tne471 THIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. vessels and nerves, which may be cut through and the limb removed. Between the rhomboidei and the senates will be seen an artery, which is the posterior scapular. The dissector of the arm will proceed at once with the dissection of the scapular muscles. The tendinous origin of the latissimus is then to be removed to expose the subjacent muscles.] The Third Layer of Muscles (Fig. 245) consists of the Serrates posticus, superior and inferior, and the Splenius, which is divided into splenius capitis and splenius colli. The Serratus Posticus Superior arises from the ligamentum nuchas, and the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper two dorsal vertebras; it passes downwards to be inserted into the superior borders of the upper four ribs, externally to their angles. The Serratus Posticus Inferior (Fig. 245, 16) arises from the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and upper two lumbar vertebras; it passes upwards to be inserted into the lower borders of the last four ribs externally to then angles. The serrati postici are antagonistic muscles, the superior raising the ribs, and being therefore a muscle of inspiration, the inferior depressing the ribs, and being therefore a muscle of expiration. TThe serrati muscles are to be divided and turned aside, when the posterior portion of the fascia lumborum covering the deeper muscles and united more or less with the origins of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior, as well as with the subjacent muscles will be seen. The name of vertebral aponeurosis has been given to the continuation of this structure beneath the serratus posticus superior and over the deep muscles; this is to be denned and afterwards must be removed.] The Splenius (Fig. 245) is single at its origin, which is from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchas, and from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper six dorsal vertebras. The splenius capitis (13), or upper portion, is inserted across the mastoid process and into the outer third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, immediately beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle. The splenius colli (14), or lower portion, is inserted into the pos- terior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper four cervical vertebras.* The splenii draw the head and neck backward, and thus assist in maintaining the erect posture. One muscle acting alone, draws the head over to the same side, i.e. it antagonizes the sterno-mastoid. * The splenius is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the vertebra) which gave origin to the levator anguli scapula).472 THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. ( The splenitis capitis was seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, but the splenius colli was hidden by the levator anguli scapulae. At the upper border of the splenius the nearly vertical fibres of the complexus appear.* The Fourth Layer of Muscles (Fig. 246) consists of the Spinalis dorsi, the Erector spinas with its subdivisions, and the Complexus. The Spinalis Dorsi (Fig. 246,4) lies close to the spinous processes, arising from the last two dorsal and upper two lumbar spinous processes, and being inserted into the spinous processes of the upper six dorsal vertebras. The Erector Spinae (Fig. 246, 1) is the great muscle filling up the hollow at the back of the sacrum and lumbar vertebras. It arises from the posterior fifth of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium ; from the posterior surface of the sacrum ; from the transverse and spinous processes of all the lumbar vertebras; as well as from the aponeurosis covering the muscle. Opposite the last rib the erector divides into the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi muscles, of which the sacro-lumbalis is the farther from the median line. The Sacro-Lumbalis (Fig. 246, 2) is the smaller of the two divisions, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the angles of the six lower ribs. The Accessorius (musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem) is placed internally to the sacro-lumbalis, and consists of muscular slips which pass from the lower six to the upper six ribs near their angles. The Cervicalis Ascendens (Fig. 246, 5) is placed internally to the accessorius, of which it is the continuation, arising from the upper four ribs, and being inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower four cervical vertebras, with the exception of the seventh, f The Longissimus Dorsi (Fig. 246, 3), the inner division of the Erector spinas, is inserted into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebras, and into the ten lower ribs externally to their tubercles. The Transversalis Cervicis (Fig. 246, 6) is the continuation of the longissimus, and lies to its inner side, arising from the transverse * The student is advised not to burden his memory with the attachments of the remaining muscles of the back, with the exception of the small muscles ot the suboccipital region.

It is inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebra. The Trach.elo-mastoid.eus (Fig. 246, 7) is to the inner side of the transversalis, and between it and the complexus. It arises, with the transversalis, from the transverse processes of the upper four dorsal vertebrae and from the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae ; and is inserted into the posterior part of the apex of the mastoid process beneath the splenitis capitis. The Complexus (Fig. 246, 8) is a large muscle placed close to the vertebra and reaching to the oc- ciput, and is remarkable for a tendinous intersection about its middle, and for being pierced by the great occipital and third nerves. It arises from the transverse pro- cesses of the upper six dorsal and last cervical vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the 4th? 5th5 and 6th cervical vertebrae. Its fibres ascend nearly vertically to be in- serted into the occipital bone be- tween the curved lines. The most internal and superficial part of the coniplexus has been Fig. 246.—Fourth, and fifth, and part of the sixth layer of the muscles of the back (from Wilson). 1.

The erector spina} is one of the most important muscles for main- taining the erect position of the trunk, and the complexus in addition draws back the head. Occipital Artery (Fig. 247, 3).—The second portion of the occi- pital artery is now exposed in its course between the muscles attached to the occipital bone. It was traced along the lower border of the digastric in the neck, and, leaving that muscle, it now runs beneath the splenius capitis and over or under the trachelo-mastoid, lying above the border of the superior oblique muscle, and then getting on to the complexus close to its insertion. It lastly pierces the trapezius to reach the back of the scalp, being accompanied by the great occipital nerve, which appears through the trapezius (1). The Arteria princeps cervicis is given off from this portion of the occipital artery,'and divides into a branch to the trapezius and. a descending larger one, which latter passes beneath the complexus to anastomose with the profunda cervicis artery on the semispmaHs. TThe complexus is to be divided transversely, at the point where the great occipital nerve pierces it, so as to preserve the nerve un- injured, and the muscle is then to be dissected up from the coixlensed cellular tissue beneath it and turned outward The small muscles with the vessels and nerves of the suboccipital region are then to be dissected out, together with the semispinals muscle which nils the vertebral groove in the cervical and dorsal regions. All vessels and nerves are to be carefully preserved.] The Fifth Layer of Muscles (Fig. 247) consists of the two Eecti, the two Obliqui, and the Semispinalis muscles. _ The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major (Fig. 247, 8) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the outer part of the inferior curved line upon the occipital bone, and into a smaU portion of the space below it. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor (Fig. 247,6) is placed close to the median line, and is slightly overlapped by the preceding muscle It arises from the posterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted by fleshy fibres into the space below the inferior curved Hue on the occipital bone, close to the median line and to its fellow muscle of the opposite side. The Obliquus Inferior (Fig. 247, 18) arises _ from the spinous process of the axis, and is inserted into the posterior tubercle ot transverse process of the atlas. Around the lower border ot tins muscle the great occipital nerve makes its appearance. nmarAa The Obliquus Superior (Fig. 247,10) is the contmuation upwards475 THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. of the preceding muscle. It arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into a mark above or outside the outer part of the inferior curved line of the occipital hone, externally to the corn- plexus and overlapping the rectus major. The occipital artery has been seen to run along the upper border of this muscle. The recti muscles draw the head backward, and the rectus major, owing to its oblique direction, assists slightly in producing rotation. The obliqui produce Eirr 24-7 rotation, the inferior JM&' -'" oblique rotating the atlas upon the axis ; the muscle of one side acting with the supe- rior oblique of the other, which latter acts slightly upon the skull. Vertebral Artery (Fig. 247, 5). — The horizontal portion of the vertebral artery will be found in the triangle formed by the rectus posticus major and the two oblique muscles. It ascends through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebra?, beginning at the sixth, and having perforated the atlas is seen to wind in the groove behind the superior articular process of that bone, and pierce the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament to: enter the vertebral canal. Lastly it reaches the interior of the skull through the foramen magnum. While in the transverse pro- cesses the artery gives small branches to the muscles and to the spinal cord, and in its horizontal portion it occasionally gives off a branch to the back of the skull to supply the muscles. The Vertebral vein does not accompany the artery in this part of Fig. 247.—Suboccipital region (drawn by J. T. Gray). 1. Occipital artery and nerve piercing 8. trapezius. 9. 2. Trapezius. 10. 3.

The vein ac- companies the artery through the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and ends in the subclavian vein. The posterior division of the Suboccipital Nerve (Fig. 247, 7) (1st cervical) emerges between the occiput and atlas, and generally beneath the vertebral artery. It is of small size, and supplies branches to the recti and obliqui muscles and one to the complexus. The Great Occipital Nerve (Fig. 247, 9) is the posterior divi- sion (internal branch) of the second cervical nerve, and leaves the vertebral canal between the atlas and axis. It winds below the inferior oblique, giving a branch to that muscle, and then turns up- ward to pierce the complexus and trapezius muscles and supply the skin of the occipital region. Its external branch is of small size. The posterior division of the third nerve gives a branch which takes the same direction as the great occipital nerve but internally to it, and is joined with it. The suboccipital nerve often joins the internal branch of the 2nd, and the latter the internal branch of the 3rd (Posterior Cervical plexus). The Deep Cervical Artery lies upon the semispinalis colli muscle, and is exposed when the complexus is reflected. It is the posterior branch of the superior intercostal artery (p. 340), and reaches the back by passing between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It supplies the deep muscles, anastomosing with the muscular branches of the verte- bral, and with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery. There is thus an anastomosis established between a branch of the carotid and a branch of the subclavian artery, which would enlarge if the common carotid artery were tied.

The Semispinalis (Fig. 246) is divided into the semispinals colli and semispinalis dorsi. Semispinalis colli (11) arises from the transverse processes of the six upper dorsal vertebras and the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebras, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical ver- tebras from the 2nd to the 5th inclusive. Semispinalis dorsi (io) arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras from the sixth to the tenth inclusive, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the last two cervical and upper four dorsal vertebras. Spinal Nerves (Fig. 248).—The Posterior Divisions of all the spinal nerves (with the exception of the first cervical and fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal) divide into internal and external branches, which supply all the muscles of the back. The Internal branches of all the cervical nerves (except the first) and of the upper six dorsal nerves become cutaneous near the spinous processes. The External branches of the lower six dorsal and of all the lumbar nerves, become cuta- neous at an oblique line corresponding to the margin of the aponeurosis of the la- tissimus dorsi. The External branches of the upper sacral nerves become cutaneous near the median line. The fourth and fifth sacral nerves are very small and join with the coc- cygeal nerve.

The Posterior Divisions of the Intercostal and Lumbar Arte- ries divide like the nerves into internal and external branches, which accompany the nerves to the muscles of the back. The Sixth Layer of Muscles (Fig. 246) consists of the Inter- spinales, Intertransversales, Multifidus Spinas, and Levatores Costa- rum, which will not repay the trouble of dissection. The position of the Interspinales and Intertransversales is suffi- ciently indicated by their names. The Multifidus Spinas (16) fills up the vertebral groove beneath the erector spinas, arising from the articular processes of the cervical and lumbar vertebrse, and from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae and sacrum. The muscle is inserted into the spinous processes of all the vertebras except the atlas. The Levatores Costarum are twelve fan-shaped muscles passing between the dorsal transverse processes and the upper borders of the ribs. The Spinal Cord and Membranes. [To open the spinal canal, the remains of the muscles of the back should be cleared away as far as possible, when some part of the plexus of clorsi-sfpinal veins may be seen upon the vertebras. A block then being placed beneath the thorax so as to make the dorsal region prominent, a cut is to be made with the saw on each side of the middle line, so as to divide the laminas of the vertebras as far out as possible. Two or three of the arches being now removed with the chisel, the point of a spine-chisel or rachet is to be introduced into the canal and the rachet carefully hammered through the arches of the vertebras for the whole length of the spine, except the upper two cervical vertebras. The operation being repeated on the opposite side, the arches can be removed with the bone-forceps, and the canal will be thoroughly opened. On the inner surface of the arches will be seen the ligamenta subflava, which are described with the other vertebral ligaments (p. 420).] Upon opening the Spinal Canal some loose tissue and fat will be seen, together with the meningeo-rachidian veins, which are occa- sionally full of blood. These extend for the whole length of the spinal cord under the name of posterior longitudinal spinal veins, 13. Scalenus anticus with phrenic 16. Splenius colli. nerve. 17. Complexus. 14.

By removing the fat and veins the dura mater will be exposed. The Dura Mater (Fig. 250, i) of the spinal cord differs from the dura mater of the brain, in being comparatively smooth on its exterior, and in not forming the periosteum of the vertebras. It also does not send processes into the spinal cord, nor has it any sinuses formed in it, but has numerous large veins on its outside. The dura mater, being opened by a longitudinal incision, will be found to be a tube firmly connected with the margin of the foramen magnum, where it is continuous with the dura mater of the skull. The tube is largest in the cervical and lumbar regions, but at the top of the sacrum it becomes imper- vious, and is continued to the coccyx by a small fibrous process. Sheaths are given to all the spinal nerves, and take corresponding directions, being nearly horizontal in the cervical region and gradually becoming more vertical below. In the sacral canal the sheaths of the nerves lie side by side with the fibrous continuation of the dura mater between them. By removing the transverse processes of two or three of the dorsal vertebras, the tubes of dura mater may be traced upon the nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and will be found to be lost upon the nerves themselves. TBy opening one of the tubes of dura mater the position of the aan4ion upon the posterior root in the intervertebral foramen will he seen The cord is next to be removed by carrying the knife alono- the outside of the dura mater so as to divide the nerves as far out as possible, those which have been thoroughly exposed by the above dissection being divided beyond the ganglion. The cord attaching the dura mater to the coccyx is to be divided, and the, sacral nerves cut as long as possible, and lastly the dura mater divided transversely at the level of the axis. The cord when removed is to be laid out on a table with the posterior surface uppermost.] too. 950 —Transverse section of the spinal cord and its membranes (from B* * Hirschfeld and Lcveille). 1 Dura mater 5- Subarachnoid space. 2.

The anterior and the posterior surfaces of the spinal cord, when removed from the body, may always be distinguished as follows :— 1. There is a bright shining cord (linea splendens) running down the anterior surface. 2. There is one spinal artery on the anterior, but two arteries on the posterior surface. 3. The posterior roots of the nerves are ganglionic. The Arachnoid (Fig. 250, 2, 3) consists of a parietal and visceral layer like the arachnoid of the brain, with which it is continuous. The parietal layer is seen on the inner surface of the dura mater, to which it is firmly attached ; the visceral layer is reflected loosely upon the spinal cord, giving to the several nerves loose sheaths, which are reflected upon themselves at the point where the nerves pierce the dura mater. The Subarachnoid Space (Fig. 250, 5) is between the visceral layer of the arachnoid and the pia mater of the spinal cord, and can be shown by lifting up the arachnoid with forceps, or by inserting a blow-pipe and forcing air beneath the membrane. This space com- municates with the interior of the brain by an opening at the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle. It lodges the subarachnoid fluid, which also enters the ventricles, and is hence called cerebrospinal fluid.* [The cord is to be turned over so as to expose its anterior surface, and an incision is to be made through the dura mater to expose the arachnoid and subarachnoid space, as was done behind. The pia mater is then to be examined both on the front and back of the cord.] The Pia Mater encloses the spinal cord, giving prolongations upon the roots of the nerves. It is continuous with the pia mater of the brain, but is more fibrous and less vascular than it. It sends a process into the anterior median fissure of the cord, opposite to which is a fibrous band called linea splendens, and at the first lumbar vertebra (termination of the spinal cord) ends in the filum terminate or central ligament of the cord, which lies within the prolongation of the dura mater, to be attached with it to the coccyx. The Ligamentum Denticulatuni (Fig. 251, 16) is found on each side of the cord between the anterior and posterior roots of the * It has been supposed that a distinct serous membrane existed beneath the true arachnoid, in which the subarachnoid fluid was contained. Mr. Hilton has given prominence to this view in his " Lectures on Rest and Pain " (1863) but the question was decided some years since by Dr. Sharpey, who found 'that microscopically there was no evidence of a second serous membrane. I ITHE SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 482 Fig. 251. nerves. It is formed by a series of twenty-one or two serrations, connected witli the pia mater and with the inner surface of the dura mater midway between the apertures of exit for the nerves. It serves to sling the cord and secure it from shocks. The Anterior Spinal Artery and the two Posterior Spinal Arteries may be traced upon the cord if well-injected. They are branches of the vertebral arteries, the anterior being formed by the junction of a branch from each side. The arteries ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with the spinal branches which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral fora- mina. The Veins of the cord pass through the intervertebral foramina to join the vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar veins. The Spinal Cord (Figs. 250, 251) extends from the termination of the medulla oblongata at the level of the upper border of the atlas, to the first lumbar vertebra. It is cylin- drical in shape, but presents two flattened enlargements, one the bra- chial, which extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and the lower or lumbar enlarge- ment near the lower extremity of the cord.

The cord presents an anterior median fissure, which extends for its whole length, and a posterior median fissure, which is most distinct at the upper and lower parts of the cord. A lateral fissure extends along the line of attachment of the poste- rior roots of the spinal nerves, thus dividing each half of the cord into an antero-lateral and a posterior column. The anterior roots of the nerves emerge from the antero-lateral columns, and these are sometimes considered to mark a further sub- division into anterior and lateral columns. At the bottom of the median fissures is the commissure, which is nearer to the anterior than the posterior surface of the cord. The Spinal Nerves (Fig. 251) are thirty-one in number on each side of the cord. Each nerve has been seen to arise by two roots, the posterior (with the exception of the first nerve) being larger than the anterior. The posterior roots, with the exception probably of the first nerve, have each a ganglion which is generally placed in the intervertebral foramen, at which point and immediately beyond the ganglion, the anterior (motor) and posterior (sensory) roots unite to form a spinal nerve of mixed endowments. The first two cervical, with the sacral and coccygeal nerves, are exceptions to the general rule as regards the position of the ganglia. The ganglia of the two cervical nerves lie upon the arches of the atlas and axis, at which point the roots of the nerves unite. The ganglia of the sacral and coccygeal nerves are within the sacral canal. Each spinal nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk, the anterior divisions being the larger throughout, except in the case of the 1st and 2nd cervical nerves, of which the posterior is larger than the anterior division. The majority of the spinal nerves divide just outside the intervertebral foramina, but in the first cervical, the last sacral, and the coccygeal nerves, the division takes place within the dura mater; and the upper four sacral nerves divide within the sacral canal, the anterior and posterior trunks emerging at the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. On a transverse section (Fig. 250) the spinal cord will be found to consist of white nervous matter, in which are seen two grey crescents with their convexities turned toward one another and connected together by a grey commissure, in front of which are some white fibres forming the tvhite commissure. i i 2THE SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 484 The anterior comua of the grey crescents are larger than the posterior comua, but do not reach to the periphery of the cord ; the slender posterior comua are closely connected with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves in the lateral fissure. A small central canal (canal of Stilling) exists throughout the cord. It is impossible for the student in his ordinary dissection to inves- tigate the minute anatomy of the spinal cord, and he is therefore referred to works on minute anatomy for fuller details.PAET VII DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Before dissecting the Membranes or Vessels of the Brain It will he well to recognise the several parts of the Encephalon, as this will assist the student in following the description. The upper part of the brain is formed by the Cerebrum or great brain which is divided into two symmetrical halves by a median longitudinal fissure. The under surface or base of the brain is much more complicated than the upper surface, and will be subsequently examined more particularly. At the posterior part will be seen the Cerebellum or smaller brain, which consists of two symmetrical halves like the great brain; these are united by a convex white body, the Pons Varolii, at the lower border of which is the. upper part of the spinal cord or Medulla Oblongata. These parts will be readily recognised by referring to Fig. 253. TThe brain is to be placed in a plate with the base upward for the examination of the membranes and the dissection of the vessels.J The Membranes of the Brain are the Dura Mater, the Arachnoid, and the Pia Mater. m , . The Dura Mater has been already seen lining the skull and giving off processes for the support of the brain (p. 299). The Arachnoid is a serous membrane which has been seen to consist of two layers —parietal, which lines the dura mater, and visceral, which is now to be examined. The Visceral layer is more or less united with the subjacent pia mater but differs from it in passing from one convolution to another without dipping into the sulci. It passes into the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres of the cerebrum, but does not quite reach the corpus callosum, and may be conveniently traced from the anterior termination of this over the base of the cerebrum, (the lobes of which it binds together) to the cerebellum and medulla oblongata,ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 486 where it becomes continuous with the arachnoid of the spinal cord. It gives sheaths to the cranial nerves as far as the foramina of exit, where they are reflected to join the parietal layer of arachnoid. Between the arachnoid and the pia mater is the Subarachnoid Space, which contains the cerebro-spinal fluid, and which, though existing all over the brain, is only easily made out in the following places :— The Anterior Subarachnoid Space (diamond-shaped space) is imme- diately in front of the pons Varolii, and is formed by the stretching of the arachnoid from one middle lobe of the cerebrum to the other, as far forward as the optic commissure. The Posterior Subarachnoid Space will be found beneath the cere- bellum on lifting up the medulla oblongata. This communicates Avith the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and with the interior of the brain by means of an aperture into the fourth ventricle, which may now be seen by removing the layer of arachnoid. The Pia Mater is a vascular membrane closely investing the brain and passing into the sulci between the convolutions, besides giving processes into the interior of the brain which will be subse- quently examined. It becomes more tough and fibrous as it ap- proaches the spinal cord, upon which its vascularity almost entirely disappears. [The arachnoid is to be removed from the arteries at the base of the brain, which are to be cleaned and the branches followed. It will now be possible to show the longitudinal fissure between the two anterior lobes of the cerebrum more clearly than before, and also the fissure of Sylvius between the anterior and middle lobes of each side, into which a large artery may be traced.] The Arteries of the Brain (Fig. 252) are derived from four great trunks—the two vertebral and the two internal carotid arteries. The Vertebral Artery (i) has been seen to be a branch of the subclavian artery, and has been traced through the transverse pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae to the atlas. The artery pierces the dura mater between the occiput and the atlas, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum by the side of the medulla oblongata. At the lower border of the pons Varolii the two vertebrals unite in the Basilar Artery (6), which passes along the middle line of the pons Varolii to bifurcate at its anterior border into the posterior cerebral arteries (8). The Branches of the Vertebral Artery are :— 1. A small Posterior Spinal artery (3), which runs down the poste- rior surface of the spinal cord with its fellow of the opposite side.487 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 2. A small Anterior Spinal artery (2), which joins its fellow of the opposite side to form a small trunk running down the antenoi sui face of the spinal cord. 3 A small Posterior Meningeal" artery (4) to the dura mater. 4 The Posterior Inferior Cerebellar artery (5), which passes bacit- watd to the posterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and anastomoses with the other cerebellar arteries. The Brandies of the Basilar Artery are :— 1 The Anterior Inferior Cerebellar arteries, a pair of small brancnes pa sing to the anterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebelluin on each side, and anastomosing with the other cerebellar arteries. These are only two of the following. 2 Transverse arteries of the Pons, four or five on each side, winch supply the pons Varolii, and one of which, the auditory, accompanies the auditory nerve into the temporal bone. _ 3 The Superior Cerebellar arteries (7), which arise close to the bi- furcation, having the third pair of nerves between them and the pos- terior cerebral arteries. Each artery winds round the crus cerebri, parallel to the fourth nerve, to the upper surface of the cerebellum, where it anastomoses with its fellow and with the inferior cerebellar 4 The Posterior Cerebral arteries (8), which are the terminal branches of the basilar trunk. Each artery winds round the crus cerebri, par- allel to the superior cerebellar artery but separated from it by the third nerve, and is distributed to the under surface of the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, where it anastomoses with the middle cerebral artery. It gives off small branches to the locus perforatus posticus, and a choroid artery to the velum interposition. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 252, 10) has been traced to the anterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone, close to which it was divided in removing the brain. The artery reaches the base of the brain close to the outer side of the optic commissure, and at once breaks up into three branches—the anterior and middle cerebral, and the posterior communicating arteries. # 1 The Anterior Cerebral artery (13) runs forward m the longitu- dinal fissure, and, turning round the corpus callosum, is distributed to the anterior part of the cerebrum. The arteries of the two sides are united at the commencement of the fissure by a short transverse branch, the anterior communicating artery (14). 2. The Middle Cerebral artery (12) is a larger branch, which runs in the fissure of Sylvius between the anterior and middle lobes, and reaches the surface of the brain, where it anastomoses with theARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 488 anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. It gives off some small branches near its commencement, which pierce the locus perforatus anticus. 3.

TThe arachnoid and pia mater are to be carefully dissected from the base of the brain, care being taken not to detach any of the nerves It should be noticed that the pia mater disappears on the outer side of each cms cerebri, beneath the middle lobe of the cerebrum; this is the commencement of the great transverse fissure of the brain which opens into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The pia mater upon the cerebellum and posterior part of the cerebrum should be left undisturbed, so that the velum mterpositum may not be damaged.] The under surface of the great brain or Cerebrum is divided into three lobes on each side of the median line. The Anterior Lobe (Fig. 253, 2) of the cerebrum is separated from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius, and from the opposite side by the longitudinal fissure. Its under surface is hollowed out in the centre, and fits closely upon the orbital plate of the skull. It presents several small orbited convolutions, and close to the median line the extremity of the convolution of the longitudinal fissure (marginal convolution), in which, about half an inch from the fissure and parallel to it, is the olfactory sulcus which lodges the olfactory peduncle. The Middle Lobe (Fig. 253, 18) of the cerebrum is separated from the anterior lobe by the fissure of Sylvius, but is continuous with the posterior lobe, the division between the two being marked only by the border of the cerebellum, the under surface of which is now seen. It occupies the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and pre-BASE OF THE BRAIN". 490 sents the convolutions forming the temporal lobe, to be afterwards described. The Posterior Lobe is not divided from the middle lobe by any- marked fissure, but is that part of the cerebrum which is above the cerebellum. It will be most convenient to examine the several structures found in the base of the brain in front of the pons Varolii from before backward, first in the median line and afterwards on each side. In the median line from before backwards are—(1) the longitudinal fissure; (2) the lamina cinerea; (3) the optic commissure ; (4) the tuber cinereum (with the infundibulum and pituitary body); (5) the corpora albicantia ; (6) the locus perforatus posticus. On each side from before backward are—(1) the under surface of the anterior lobe of the cerebrum, with (2) the olfactory bulb and the olfactory peduncle resting in the olfactory sulcus ; (3) the optic nerve (in front of the commissure), and (4) the optic tract (behind the com- missure) ; (5) the locus perforatus anticus close to the commencement of (6) the fissure of Sylvius ; (7) the cms cerebri diverging from its fellow, with the commencement of the transverse fissure to its outer side ; (8) the third nerve appearing between the divergent crura; (9) the fourth nerve winding round the cms ; (10) the under surface of the middle lobe of the cerebrum. The Longitudinal Fissure (Fig. 253, i) is the terminal portion of the fissure which divides the upper surface of the brain into the two hemispheres. It separates the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, and, if these are drawn apart, a white body will be seen at the bottom of the fissure, which is the corpus callosum; the anterior part, around which the anterior cerebral artery turns, being known as the genu, and the central portion continued into the lamina cinerea as the rostrum. The Lamina Cinerea (Fig. 253, 4) is a thin grey layer, con- tinuous with the under surface of the corpus callosum and prolonged to the margin of the optic commissure. This is often torn in remov- ing the brain. The Optic Commissure or Chiasma (Fig. 253, 7) is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The fibres of each optic tract are said to have the foUowing arrangement :—The outer- most fibres pass to the optic nerve of the same side ; the middle fibres decussate with those of the opposite side forming a figure of X, and pass to the optic nerve of the opposite side ; the most internal fibres are reflected back to the brain along the opposite optic tract behind the cross arrangement, and a few fibres of the optic nerve pass in front of it from one eye to the other.491 THE TUBER CINEREUM. The Tuber Cinereum (Fig. 253, 8) is a grey body placed imme- diately behind the optic chiasma.

The pituitary body (if left attached) will be seen to be solid in the adult, and to consist of two lobes of a reddish colour. The anterior lobe is the larger, and is oblong in shape; the posterior lobe is round. The relation of the infundibulum and pituitary body to the tuber cinereurn will be better understood by referring to the vertical section of the brain (Fig. 263, 20). The Corpora Albicantia or Mammillaria (Fig. 253,10) are two white bodies resembling small peas, which are placed between the two crura cerebri. They are formed by the anterior crura of the fornix which, as will be afterwards seen, descend to the base of the brain and there make a sudden twist upon themselves, thus forming the bodies. Upon section grey matter will be found in the interior of each body (Fig. 256, 8). The Locus Perforatus Posticus (Fig. 253, 12) (Pons Tarmi) is placed in the angle between the two crura cerebri. It is composed of grey matter, and is perforated by numerous vessels going to the thalamus opticus. The several structures which have been enumerated in the median line, viz., lamina cinerea, optic chiasma, tuber cinereurn, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus posticus, are all included within the area of the circle of Willis, and also form the floor of the third ven- tricle of the brain, as will be seen on referring to a vertical section (Fig. 263). The Olfactory Peduncle (First nerve) (Fig. 253, 3) is of a pris- matic shape and is very soft, being destitute of neurilemma and only held in its place by a reflection of the arachnoid. The peduncle has three roots, two white and one grey. The external root (white) passes across the fissure of Sylvius in the middle lobe, and may be traced to the corpus striatum ; the internal root (white) goes to the inner side of the anterior lobe ; the middle root (grey) passes to the papilla of grey matter in the olfactory sulcus. The Olfactory Bulb (Fig. 253, 3) is formed upon the extremity of the olfactory peduncle, and from it the branches of the olfactory nerve arise which descend to the nose. It contains grey matter, is oval in shape, and rests upon the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The Optic or Second Nerve (Fig. 253, 7) passes from the optic commissure to the eye-ball, where it is lost in the retina. It is round and firm, and is invested by a sheath of dura mater. It has been "1or processus a cerebello ad pontem. Emerging from the side 0 the THE PONS VAROLII. ■town that each optic nerve has fibres derived from the opposite as pp^coS:r4h(thf brain!.

It is composed of grey nervous matter and is perfoiated by numerous small branches from the middle cerebral artery. The Fissure of Sylvius (Fig. 253, 5) runs outwards between he anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum, and is middle cerebral artery. It corresponds to the margin of thelesser wing of the sphenoid bone when the brain is m stiu, and is divided xnto two portions on the outer aspect of the bram which will be subsequently traced. At the bottom of the fissure will be seen a few KSi^t coavolnldanB (gyri operti) aggregated together, to which the name Island of Keil or central lobe has been applied. The Crus Cerebri (Fig. 253, 14) (peduncle of the cerebruin) is one of two large white bodies, which appear at the anterior 1>order of the pons Varolii and diverge to enter the under surface of the^ cere- brum It is continuous with the anterior columns of the spinal coid through the pons Varolii. Winding round each crus are the optic tract and the fourth nerve, and between the two crura is he inter- peduncular space containing the tuber cinereum, the corpora albicantia, and the locus perforatus posticus. m The Third Nerve (Fig. 253, 9) (motor ocuh) is a good-sized nerve which appears with its fellow between the crura cerebri in front of rt.P nous Varolii The fibres are connected with the grey substance ^I^b niger), and may be traced to the floor of the fourth ^TheFourth Nerve (Fig. 253, 11) (trochlearis vel patheticus) is the smallest of the cranial nerves, and winds round the crus cerebri. It will be afterwards traced to the valve of Vieussens > The Pons Varolii or Annular Protuberance (Fig. 253, 16) is the large white body immediately behind the crura and in front of the medulla oblongata. It is more or less convex from side to side, but is slightly grooved along the middle line by the basilar artery. On each side is a round thick process of white fibres passing obliquely outwards and backwards to the cerebellum, which is the crus cenbelh494 BASE OF THE BKAIN. pons is the fifth nerve, and overlying it (in this position) is the sixth pair of nerves. The Fifth Nerve (Fig. 253,13) (trifacial, trigeminal) is the largest of the cranial nerves, and consists of two portions, motor and sensory, of which the motor is the smaller and the anterior. The nerve arises from the side of the pons Varolii, a few fibres of which intervene be- tween the two roots ; but its deep origin can be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Sixth Nerve (Fig. 253, 15) (abducens oculi) arises from the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata close to the posterior border of the pons, and slightly from the pons itself. It may be traced deeply to a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Medulla Oblongata (Fig. 253) is the upper part of the spinal cord, and extends from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the pons, being about an inch and a quarter in length. The medulla oblongata contains all the elements of the spinal cord, which are continued through it to the great brain, and has in addition a special body, the olive or olivary body, and a number of grey nuclei for the origin of several nerves. It will be impossible to see more than the superficial anatomy of the medulla at this stage, the rest will be taken with the dissection of the cerebellum. The medulla is divided into two symmetrical halves by an Anterior Median Fissure, which is continuous with the anterior fissure of the spinal cord. On either side of the fissure is the rounded Anterior Pyramid (corpus pyramidal*) (20), which is continuous with the anterior column of the cord ; the two anterior pyramids decussate across the median fissure at the lower part of the medulla. The Lateral Tract (24) is continuous with the lateral column of the spinal cord. At the lower part of the medulla it is broad, and is placed between the anterior pyramid and the restiform body, but at the upper part it is narrowed and pushed aside by the projection of the olivary body between it and the anterior pyramid. The Olivary body (22) is an ovoid projection close to the anterior pyramid and immediately below the pons, but is separated by a groove from the surrounding parts. Some white fibres arching below and over the olivary body have been called the arciform fibres. The Restiform body is only slightly seen at the side of the medulla in this view, but will be afterwards dissected with the fourth ventricle. The Seventh Nerve (Fig. 253) consists of two portions, the portio dura or Facial nerve and the portio mollis or Auditory nerve, the 1495 THE NINTH NERVE. facial being anterior and the auditory posterior; and between the two is a minute nerve, which has been named pars mtermedza and ioins the facial nerve. J The vortio dura (17) is round, and smaller than the portio mollis ; it arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata close to the pons,' and slightly from the pons itself. The deep origin can be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. _ The vortio mollis (19) is flattened and very soft, owing to the absence of neurilemma. It arises from the floor of the fourth ventricle and from the restiform body, around which it winds to loin the facial nerve. The deep origin of the nerve is partly from the auditory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and partly from the posterior pyramid of the medulla. The Eighth Nerve (Fig. 253) consists of three portions, the Glossopharyngeal nerve, the Pneumo-gastric nerve, and the Spinal- accessory nerve, which lie in that order from before backwards. The Glossopharyngeal nerve (21) is the smallest of the three nerves, and arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata by three or four fibrillee. . The Pneumo-gastric or Vagus nerve (23) arises from the lateral tract below the glossopharyngeal, by a number of fibrillar which unite to form a single nerve. This lies parallel to the glossopha- ryngeal nerve and upon (in this view) a small lobe of the cerebellum, which has therefore been called the lobe of the pneumo-gastric or ^tTsvinal-accessory nerve (25) arises partly from the medulla and partly from the spinal cord. The upper part (accessory to vagus) arises bY fine fibrillae, below the origin of the pneumo-gastric, for the whole length of the medulla. The spinal portion (Fig. 251, 9) arises bv fine fibrillar from the side of the spinal cord, between the ligamen- tuni denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, as low as the sixth cervical nerve. The deep origins of the eighth pair may be traced to special nuclei in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres are connected with the grey matter of the spinal cord. The Ninth or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 253, 27) arises by numerous fibrillae from the groove between the anterior pyramid and the olivary body. The nerve consists of two bundles which pierce the dura mater separately. The deep fibres may be traced to a special nucleus at the lower part of the fourth ventricle.

These are in alternate layers, the transverse being continuous with the crura cerebelli, and the longitudinal with the fibres of the cord and the crura cerebri.

[The brain being placed with the base downwards, the pia mater is to be removed from the upper surface of the cerebrum.] The Upper Surface of the Brain (Figs. 254 and 255) is divided into two symmetrical halves, or hemispheres, by the loiigitudinal Fig. 254.

By separating the hemispheres, the white corpus callosmn will be seen at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure. The surface of the brain is marked by convolutions, the intervals between which are called sulci, and these have recently acquired sufficient impor- tance to require individual notice, although the arrangement of the convolutions is not precisely the same in any two brains, or even on both sides of the same brain.

K KEXTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 498 (p. 493), separating the anterior from the middle lobe, can now he traced out, and will he seen to divide into two portions, the posterior or horizontal, which runs between the frontal (f) and temporal (t), lobes, and the anterior or vertical (c) which ascends between the frontal convolutions. Posterior to this portion of the fissure of Sylvius is a well-marked groove, the fissure of Rolando (d) which, beginning at the margin of the longitudinal fissure, runs downward and forward nearly to the horizontal Sylvian fissure, being bounded in front and behind by two large and well-marked convolutions, and separating the frontal from the parietal lobe. The Parallel Fissure (/) is a well-marked fissure parallel to and below the horizontal Sylvian fissure, and running between the con- volutions of the temporal lobe. The Parieto-occipital fissure (h) separates the parietal and occipital lobes more or less completely, being sometimes a mere notch at the upper margin of the hemisphere. It is continuous with the parieto- occipital fissure seen on the inner surface of the hemisphere, which commences near the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous with the calcarine fissure, and passes upwards and backwards to the upper surface of the hemisphere. The Frontal Lobe (f) contains one well-marked vertical convolu- tion bounding the fissure of Rolando, and called the ascending frontal convolution (4), with three more or less horizontal convolutions in front of it, named respectively lower (1), middle (2), and upper (3) frontal. The Parietal Lobe (p) contains one well-marked vertical convolu- tion posterior to the fissure of Rolando, and called the ascending parietal convolution (5), with three more or less horizontal convolu- tions behind it, named respectively the parietal lobule, the supra- marginal lobule, and the angular gyrus. The Parietal Lobule ($') is continuous with the ascending parietal convolution, and lies along the margin of the longitudinal fissure, being connected to the upper part of the occipital lobe by the first annectent convolution (a). The Supra-marginal Lobule (a) lies below the preceding, and above the fissure of Sylvius. It is very variable in shape and size, and is connected posteriorly with the following convolution. The Angular Gyrus (6) is posterior to the supra-marginal lobule, and is very irregular in form. Behind, it is connected with the occipital lobe by the second annectent convolution (/3). Between the ascending parietal convolution and the supra-marginal lobule is the commencement of a fissure named by Turner intra- )K K 2 INNER SURFACE OF HEMISPHERE. ■parietal, which takes a curved course between the convolutions of the parietal lobe. . . The Temporal Lobe (t) contains three well-marked horizontal con- ■ volutions. The first (7) lies between the fissure of Sylvius and the parallel fissure, and the second (8) and third (9) are immediately below, separated from one another by the inferior temporal fissure. The second and third temporal convolutions are connected with the occipital lobe by the third (y) and fourth (8) annectent convolutions. The Occipital Lobe (o) is continuous with the temporal lobe, and contains three badly-defined convolutions placed horizontally, and named first (10), second (11), and third (12). TA slice of brain substance about an inch thick is to be removed from the right hemisphere, when the centrum ovale minus will be exposed.] The Centrum Ovale Minus is the oval mass of white cerebral matter, surrounded by convolutions, which forms the hemisphere. The convolutions will be seen to have a cortical layer of grey sub- stance superficial to their white substance, which is continuous with the centre of the hemisphere. Numerous minute points will be seen on the surface of the white matter, which are the puncta vasculosa or orifices of minute blood-vessels, from which blood exudes in the recent condition. The Inner Surface op the Hemisphere. [By slicing off one hemisphere to the level of the corpus callosum, a side view of the opposite hemisphere will be obtained, but to com- plete the study of the inner surface of the hemisphere a section ot a hardened brain should be referred to.] The Inner Surface of the Hemisphere (Fig. 256) at its anterior part presents two large convolutions, the upper, the marginal con- volution (1) (convolution of longitudinal fissure), and the lower, the convolution of the corpus callosum (2) or gyrus fornicatus, separated by the calloso-marginal .fissure (c m), which reaches the margin of the hemisphere and bounds the marginal convolution posteriorly. The Gyrus Fornicatus(2) is a well-marked convolution, which begins at the anterior perforated space in the base of the brain, and winds round the corpus callosum to the posterior part, where it becomes continuous with the upper internal temporal convolution or uncinate gyrus. Posterior to the marginal convolution, and continuous below with the gyrus fornicatus is the quadrate lobe (q), which is separated from500 INNER SURFACE OF THE HEMISPHERE. the occipital hie (o) by the parieto-occipital fissure (p o), a continuation of the fissure of the same name seen externally. The Occipital Lobe (o) is triangular in shape, and is placed between the parieto-occipital and the calcarine fissure (c), which separates it from the internal convolutions of the temporal lobe (t). The Calcarine Fissure (c) of Huxley runs below the occipital lobe to the extremity of the gyrus fornieatus, being joined midway by the parieto-occipital fissure. It is an important fissure, since it corre- sponds to the projection called the hippocampus minor m the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. . The Internal Temporal Convolutions form the lower part of the inner waU of the hemisphere, and are continuous with those of the temporal lobe externally. The most important is the Uncinate Gyrus (3), which is immediately below the calcarine fissure and runs horizontally ior- Fi°\ 256.-—The inner and under surfaces of the Drain to show the convolutions (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

TheTorpus Callosum (Fig. 257, 4) forms the great commissure of the brain, and consists of fibres passing transversely from one hemi- phe e to the other.

It lies hetween the two layers of the septum lucidum, and is deepest in front. It is lined by a delicate membrane, which in the adidt forms a shut sac, but in the foetus communicates with the subjacent third ventricle.

It is placed beneath the anterior part of the fornix, immediately behind its anterior pillars, and the choroid plexus has already been traced to it (Fig. 263, 10). The Hippocampus Minor (Fig. 258, 7) is a projection of variable size from the inner wall of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, corre- sponding to the calcarine fissure. It is white on the surface but grey in the interior.

The Hippocampus Major (Fig. 258, 3) » continuous with the posterior peduncle of the fornix. It is a prominent^convex body cor- responding to the *** fissure, and winds forward to the extremity of the cornu. Its anterior extremity is enlarged, and is marked with more or less distinct transverse grooves, and to this part the name Pes Hippocampi (1) has been given, from its fancied resemblance to the foot of an animal. ; . At the anterior border of the hippocampus major is a thm band ot white cerebral matter continuous with the corpus fimbnatum and therefore with the fornix, but now called the Taenia Hippocampi (Fi« 258 2) By lifting this up with the handle of the scalpel and turning it aside, a serrated free border of grey nervous matter will be seen which has been called the Fascia Dentata (4). This is the grey matter of the convolution which forms the pes hippocampi, as may be seen by making a transverse section of it. The Choroid Plexus of the descending cornu is continuous with the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and can now be seen to be connected with the pia mater through a slit immediately 111 front ot the taenia hippocampi (transverse fissure of Bichat). The Pes Accessorius or Eminentia Collateralis (Fig. 2o8, 5) is a projection of variable size at the commencement of the descend- ing cornu, and between the hippocampus major and hippocampus minor, corresponding to the collateral fissure. [By cutting through the fornix opposite the foramen of Monro, it can be carefully lifted up with the handle of the scalpel and turned backward, when some transverse markings on its under surface will be seen (from which it has been called the Lyra), and the velum interpositum beneath will be brought into view. By carefully scrapie away the brain substance with the handle of the knife, the continuity of the velum interpositum with the pia mater through the great transverse fissure may be demonstrated.] The Velum Interpositum (Fig. 259, 5) is a triangular process of pia mater carried into the interior of the brain through the great transverse fissure, which is now laid open. The continuity of the pia mater may be traced upon the upper surface of the cerebellum and the under surface of the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, and it may be followed through the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle to the base of the brain, where it appears by the side of the crus cerebri (v. p. 489). At each side of the velum interpositum are the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, and in the centre are twoINTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 506 veins (Vence Galeni), which open into the straight sinus of the dura mater (Fig. 263, 3). The Great Transverse Fissure, or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 253, 11) which is now opened, is the slit by which the pia mater enters Fiff. 259 the brain. It is opposite the interval between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and reaches forward in the brain beneath the fornix and corpus caHosum, and above the great ganglia of the brain (corpora striata and optic thalami). The fissure is continued downward on each side in the descending comu of the lateral ventricle, and reaches the base of the brain at the outer side of each cms cerebri.

The thalamus opticus forms the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and by drawing it upward on the side upon which the cornu has been opened, two projections on its under surface may be seen. These are the Corpora Geniculata (externum and internum)508 INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. of which the outer one is the larger. By turning the brain on its side the optic tract may he readily traced to the under surface of the optic thalamus, to which it is attached; and will he found to divide into two parts, which are connected with the corpora geniculata, and pass on to the corpora quadrigemina.

It is of a darker colour than the cerebrum, and its surface is divided into laminae instead of convolu- tions and these are separated by shallow sulci. The cerebellum isTHE CEREBELLUM. 510 Fig. 261. divisible into two lateral halves united by a commissure, and the horizontal fissure divides the organ into an upper and a lower part. The upper surface is flat except in the median line, where there is a slight, ridge forming the commissure, and called the superior vermiform process. The upper part of each hemisphere is divided into an ante- rior and a posterior lobe by an indis- tinct fissure. The anterior lobe is the larger, and of a square shape, reaching as far back as the posterior extremity of the vermiform process. The posterior lobe is the small por- tion behind the level of the vermi- form process, and reaches to the hori- zontal fissure. The cerebellum is connected to the cerebrum and spinal cord by three peduncles or crura, of which the superior one can now be seen. The Superior Peduncle (Fig. 261, 3) (processus a cerebello ad testes) is a broad, flattened white band, which is connected below with the inferior vermiform process, and passes forwards to the corpora quadrige- mina, the two peduncles of opposite sides converging at the posterior The two processes are prolonged beneath the border of the testes.

The Valve of Vieussens (Fig. 260,13) (Velum medullars anterius) is the thin layer of white nervous matter stretched between the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and connected with the anterior extremity of the inferior vermiform process. It is narrow in front, but broader behind, where it has a little grey matter connected with it, and is often torn through, in which case the cavity of the fourth ventricle is exposed. The fourth pair of nerves arises from the middle line of the valve close behind the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263,15). [The preparation is to be turned over for the examination of the remaining peduncles and of the under surface of the cerebellum.] The Middle Peduncle (Fig. 261,4) (processus a cerebello adpontem) has been already seen at the base of the brain. It is the largest of the three peduncles, and the fibres pass across the pons from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to the other, constituting the super- ficial transverse fibres of the pons, which have been already dissected. The Inferior Peduncle (Fig. 261, 5) (processus a cerebello ad medullam) forms part of the restiform body of the medulla, and will he better seen when the fourth ventricle is opened. The Inferior Surface (Fig. 262) of the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres by a deep fissure, the vallecula, at the bottom of which is the inferior vermiform process, which is to be seen by drawing the medulla oblongata well forward. Each hemisphere is divided somewhat arbitrarily into lobes, since the divisions between them are very uncertain. Beginning behind is the Posterior Lobe (11); next the Slender Lobe (10) ; and in front of that the Biventral or Digastric Lobe (5). The Amygdala or Tonsil (Fig. 253, 29) is a prominent lobe, close to the vallecula which it partially conceals. The Flocculus (Fig. 262, 4) is a small lobe immediately in front of the biventral lobe, which lies beneath the crus cerebelli, and is hence called the subpeduncular lobe. ■' The Inferior Vermiform Process (Fig. 262) is divided into the following portions. Most anteriorly is the Nodule (6), which projects into the fourth ventricle; posterior to this is the thin ridge called the Uvula (7), from the fact of its lying between the two tonsils ; behind this is the Pyramid (9), and- posterior to this again are a few trans- verse commissural fibres. By turning aside or cutting away the amygdalae, a layer of white matter will be brought into view, extending from the flocculus on512 THE CEREBELLUM. each side to the tip of the nodule. This is the Velum Medullare Posterius (8). [The brain being again placed with the base downward, an incision is to be made through the valve of Vieussens and the cerebellum, in order to expose fully the cavity of the/ourth ventricle.] The Fourth. Ventricle (Fig. 261, 6) is situated at the back of the pons Varolii and the medulla oblongata, those bodies forming its floor. The roof is formed by the valve of Vieussens and the inferior vermi- Fijv. 262. form process of the cerebellum ■ the sides by the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum (processus ad testes) above, and below by the restiform body. The cavity of the ventricle is lozenge-shaped, and it communicates above with the third ventricle by the Aqueduct of Sylvius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum), which passes beneath the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263, 16). Below, the fourth ventricle is closed by a reflection of pia mater, in which there is usually an opening establishing a communication between the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. Connected with this process of pia mater is the Choroid "plexus of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 262, 3), which extends for some distance into the cavity.

On each side of this groove is a convex body, the fasciculus teres, which is white at the upper part of the ventricle, hut covered below by grey matter, and is the Fig. 263. continuation of the fibres of the lateral tract and restiform body of the medulla. There are four gangliform projections or nuclei on each side of the median groove in the floor of the ventricle. The upper one is for the sixth and facial nerves, and immediately below are some white lines Fig. 263.—Vertical longitudinal section of the brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The lower nuclei are for the auditory, the eighth, and the ninth nerves. The lower extremity of the ventricle, which is bounded on each side by the enlarged extremities {processus clavati) of the Posterior Pyramids of the spinal cord, has been called the calamus scriptorius, from its fancied resemblance to a pen, of which the linese transversa? form the feathers. By slicing vertically either hemisphere of the cerebellum, the appear- Fi?. 264. ance known as the arbor vitai (Fig. 263, 19) will be brought into view. This is due to the pecu- liar arrangement of white cerebral matter within the grey matter of the external laminae ; and by careful slicing, an irre- gular grey body {corpus dentatum) will be seen in the centre of the white matter of each hemi- sphere. By making a transverse section of the medulla oblongata a small corpus dentatum will also be seen in the olivary body of each side (Fig. 264, c). When possible, the student as soon as he has finished the above dissection, should procure another brain in order that he may make various sections of it, and so more thoroughly understand the rela- tions of the several parts. The most useful section is one made in the median plane (Fig. 263), or a little to one side of it (Fig. 257), by which most of the important parts will be exposed.

In order to study the general anatomy of the globe of the eye it will he hest to procure half-a-dozen bullocks' eyes, since' the parts are larger than in the human eye, which also it is difficult to procure in a sufficiently recent condition. It must be borne in mind however that the eye of the bullock differs from that of man in the following particulars ; the cornea is oval instead of being nearly circular; the pupil is elongated into a slit instead of being a circular aperture ; the choroid coat presents the peculiar coloured appearance known as the tapetum lucidum, which is absent in man ; and the yellow spot which is present in the human retina is wanting in the eyes of quadrupeds. The following description will be of the human eye, which the student will find no difficulty in following. [All the fat and the remnants of the muscles of the eye are to be removed with scissors, the optic nerve being carefully preserved.] The Human Eyeball (Fig. 265) is nearly globular in shape, but has a portion of a smaller sphere (the cornea) projecting anteriorly, thus making its antero-posterior greater than the transverse diameter. The Sclerotic (Fig. 265, n) or external tunic is composed of dense white fibrous tissue, and serves to maintain the shape of the eyeball and to protect the internal parts. It is thicker behind than in front, and is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve, which enters at a distance of about its own breadth to the inner side of the axis of the eyeball. The opening in the sclerotic for the optic nerve is funnel-shaped, and the fibrils of the nerve pass through a fine fibrous tissue which has been named lamina cribrosa from its numerous aper- tures, one of which in the centre for the arteria centralis retinae has been called the porus opticus. The sclerotic is pierced at various points by the ciliary vessels and nerves. In front, the sclerotic gives insertion to the recti muscles, from which it receives an expansion {tunica albuginea), and in front of this point the conjunctiva is re- l l 2516 THE EYEBALL. fleeted upon its surface, but can be readily stripped up as far as the margin of the cornea. The sclerotic overlaps the margin of the cornea as the case of a watch does the watch-glass, and encroaches upon it slightly above and below. The sclerotic and the cornea are inseparably united, the tissue of the two structures being continuous. By squeezing the eyeball between the finger and thumb the cornea Fig. 265. will be rendered white and opaque, but will resume its former appearance when the pressure is relaxed. The Cornea (Fig. 265, i) is one of the transparent media of the eye • and in man is perfectly circular when seen from within, but appears wider transversely from without, on account of the greater overlapping of the sclerotic above and below. The curvature of the cornea varies in different individuals, but the anterior and posterior surfaces are always parallel. The cornea is divisible into five layers : 1, anterior epithelium (conjunctiva) ; 2, anterior elastic lamina ; 3, cornea proper ; 4, posterior elastic lamina; 5, posterior epithelium (of aqueous humour). The cornea in health is a non-vascular structure, no blood-vessels existing m it and its Fig. 265.—Longitudinal section of the eye (drawn by H. Power). 7. Ciliary body and process. 8.

Minute branches of the ciliary nerves have however "been traced into and through it. [Holding the eye lightly with the left hand, the scalpel is to be thrust through the margin of the cornea into the anterior chamber, when the aqueous humour will necessarily escape. With scissors the cornea may then be removed entirely.] The Anterior Chamber (Fig. 265, 3) is the space between the cornea and the iris. It communicates with the posterior chamber through the pupil, and is filled with the aqueous humour. The Iris (Fig. 265, 2) is the highly vascular curtain which separates the anterior from the posterior chamber. It is composed of involun- tary muscular fibres, blood-vessels, and pigment, and may be con- sidered to be a prolongation of the choroid coat. In man the pigment of the iris is of various colours, but it is absent altogether in albinos, and occasionally the iris itself is wanting. The Pupil is a circular opening (in man) in the centre of the iris, which varies in size according to the contraction of the tissue of the iris under the influ- ence of light. The Posterior Chamber is smaller than the anterior, and can be hardly said to exist when the aqueous humour has been let out. It is between the iris and the anterior layer of the capsule of the lens. [In order to see the choroid coat entire, a fresh eye should be. taken, and a puncture having been made through the sclerotic, about its middle, a blowpipe is to be introduced, through which air may be forced between the sclerotic and choroid coats, and they will thus be separated from one another. The sclerotic may then be cautiously divided circularly, and the posterior cup-like portion of the sclerotic being left as a support to the eye, the anterior part (with the cornea) is to be carefully detached from the choroid. In order to do this it will be necessary to scrape the interior of the sclerotic with the handle of the scalpel, in order to tear through the ciliary muscle which attaches the choroid to the sclerotic coat.] The Choroid Coat (Fig. 266, 3) is a vascular structure containing pigment, expanded over the whole of the posterior portion of the globe of the eye and continuous in front with the iris. It is pierced by the optic nerve, at which point it is closely connected to the sclerotic ; but is attached to the inner surface of that coat only by a delicate fibrous tissue, called the membrana fusca. On the outer surface of the choroid may be seen (in an injected specimen) the loops of blood-vessels; the name vasa vorticosa has been given to the veins; the arteries are derived from the ciliary branches of theTHE EYEBALL. 518 ophthalmic. Within this is the tunica Buyschiana, a plexus of capillaries. The dark pigment of the choroid is interspersed among the vessels, and is washed out when the eye is immersed in water. Surrounding the iris is a ring -which is the Ciliary Muscle 26g (Fig. 265,8), composed of °' \ unstriped fibre and hav- muscle, by drawing forward the anterior part of the choroid, relaxes the suspensory ligament of the lens and allows its own elasticity to come into play, in consequence of which the lens increases in thickness in order to accommodate the focus of the eye •to near objects. [In order to see the ciliary body and processes, a third eye should be divided circularly through the sclerotic and choroid coats, without damaging the vitreous humour ; the vitreous humour and lens are then to be carefully separated from the anterior part of the choroid, the ciliary processes being detached from the hyaloid membrane, upon which they will leave a circle marked with more or less pigment (circle of Zinn). The ciliary processes and iris are now seen from behind. If the lens and vitreous humour be drawn out of the fundus of an eye and left attached to the ciliary processes, a magnified view of these will be obtained.] Eig. 266.—The choroid coat and the distribution of the vasa vorticosa (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1.

The anterior part of the ciliary muscle is con- nected with the sclerotic coat, and the posterior part is attached to that portion of the choroid which is called the ciliary body, and from which the ciliary processes pass inwards to be connected with the capsule of the lens.

The Ciliary Body (Fig. 265, 7) is the thickened portion of the choroid from which the Ciliary Processes (Fig. 267, 4) project towards the centre of the eye. These are vascular fringes which resemble a series of plaits in appearance, and which form a circular curtain parallel but posterior to the iris, from which they are separated by the -posterior chamber. They fit into a corresponding series of grooves in the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour, and together constitute the ciliary zone. Between the anterior margin of the sclerotic and the ciliary body is a minute canal, which runs round the entire circumference of the eye and is called the Canal of Fontanel (Fig. 265, 5). [The lens will be seen on the posterior half of this section, or may be shown on the first eye by carefully removing the iris.] The Lens (Fig. 265, 4) is situ- ated in front of the vitreous humour, and is contained in a delicate and perfectly transparent capsule, which is united behind with the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour. The cap- sule is kept in its place by the suspensory ligament of the lens, a trans- parent membrane which passes from the ciliary processes to the capsule in front of the hyaloid membrane. By tearing through the capsule (as in the operation for extraction of cataract), its existence will be demonstrated and the lens itself allowed to escape. The lens is bi-convex, but the posterior surface has a greater curve than the anterior. It is perfectly transparent in health, but lias a complicated structure consisting of fibres arranged around three axes running in different directions, of which indications are usually visible in the bullock's eye. The exterior of the lens readily breaks down, but the interior or nucleus is very dense. The Canal of Petit (Fig. 265, 6) is a minute space surrounding Eig. 267.—Anterior half of the eye, seen from within (from Wilson). 1 Divided ed<*o of the three coats; 3.

The Vitreous Humour (Fig. 265, 13) is the transparent body filling all the posterior part of the eyeball. It is a gelatinous sub- stance contained in a transparent membrane called the hyaloid membrane, and is traversed by, numerous delicate and perfectly transparent septa. The existence of these may be demonstrated by crushing the vitreous humour with the fingers, when the fluid portion will drain away. In the eye from which the vitreous humour has been removed the retina will fall together, leaving the inner surface of the choroid exposed, and in the bullock's eye the tapetum lucidum will be seen. This is the coloured appearance which is peculiar to the lower animals, and is due to the presence of a thick layer of wavy fibrous tissue outside the choroidal epithelium. The object of this is to reflect the rays through the retina a second time, and thus to enable the animal to see with a very small amount of light. [The retina is best seen by looking through the vitreous humour of an eye from which the iris and lens have been removed.] The Retina (Fig. 265, 9) is the nervous coat of the eye and its essential part. It lines the choroid coat, being connected posteriorly with the optic nerve, and extends in front nearly as far forward as the ciliary body, where it terminates about one-eighth of an inch behind the margin of the cornea in.a finely jagged border, the ora serrata, being thicker behind than in front. During life the retina is transparent, so that the vascular choroid can be seen through it with the ophthalmoscope, but after death it has a greyish colour and is thrown into folds, owing to the diminution of the tension of the globe. The entrance of the optic nerve may be seen about one-tenth of an inch to the inner side of the axis of the eye, and radiating from this may be seen the branches of the arteria centralis retina;, which enters the eye at this point, and its accompanying veins. In the axis of the eyeball in the human eye is the yellow spot of Soemmering, the most sensitive point, which consists of a small elevation, in the centre of which is a minute depression, the fovea centralis. The retina (Fig. 269) consists of eight layers with two delicate limiting membranes, which are as follows, beginning from the inner surface :—a. The membrana limitans interna. 1. The fibrous layer continuous with the optic nerve (the fibrillte of which here lose their white substance of Schwann), and having numerous ganglionic cells521 THE RETINA. and nuclei developed in it. 2.

The outer layer on Jacob's membrane consists of a peculiar arrangement of particles to which the names rods and cones Fig. 268. Fig. 269. have been given. These rods are continuous with some fibres which pierce the whole depth of the retina, and are called the fibres of Muller. 8. The pig- mentary layer consisting of hex- agonal pigment cells, which were formerly considered to belong to „ the choroid coat (Fig. 268).

The description of the External Ear will he found at page 348, and that of the Middle Ear or Tympanum at page 406. The Internal Ear or Labyrinth is so difficult of dissection, owing to the density of the bone in which it is embedded, that it is impos- sible for the student to make its dissection with any advantage. He is therefore advised to study its anatomy on prepared specimens, and is referred for its description to works on general and minuteINDEX Abdomen, 166. surface of, 185.

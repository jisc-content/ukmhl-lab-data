PELVIC BLOOD-VESSELS. 261 the lateral lobe of the prostate to supply its sub- stance. The middle hcemorrhoidal almost invariably pro- ceeds from the inferior vesical. It is given to the coats of the rectum, and anastomoses above with the superior haemorrhoidal termination of the inferior mesenteric, and below with the inferior haemorrhoidal twigs from the internal pudic. The obturator artery proceeds forwards upon the inner aspect of the pelvic wall to the upper part of the thyroid foramen. Here it comes into relation with the nerve of the same name, and both leave the cavity by passing above the pelvic fascia and through the groove upon the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone. Within the pelvis it lies in the extra-peritoneal fatty tissue, between the peritoneum and the parietal pelvic fascia; the obturator nerve is placed at a higher level, whilst the vein lies below it. In this part of its course the obturator artery furnishes a small iliac branch to the parts in the iliac fossa, and a minute pubic branch, which ramifies upon the back of the pubic bone and anastomoses with a similar branch from the deep epigastric artery. Th.^ pudic artery is now seen in thQ pelvic part of its course. It proceeds downwards upon the pyriformis muscle and sacral nerves, and reaching the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, it leaves the pelvis by passing through it. In the gluteal region it appears between the pyriformis and the superior gemellus.

140 LOWER LIMB. two articular nerves are associated with the azygos articular artery, and one is given to the pouch of synovial membrane which projects upwards under cover of the quadriceps extensor tendons. There are thus ten nerves of supply to the joint, and they are derived as follows :â€”(i.) three from the iyiter- nal popliteal to accompany the two internal articular arteries and the azygos artery; (2.) three from the external popliteal to accompany the two external articular arteries and the recurrent tibial artery; (3.) one from the deep division of the obturator which pierces the posterior ligament of the knee-joint with the azygos artery ; (4.) three from the anterior crural; two of these come from the nerves of supply to the vastus externus and vastus internus respectively, and they accompany the descending branch of the external circumflex and the articular branch of the anastomotica magna ; the third comes from the nerve to the subcrureus, and supplies the upper part of the synovial pouch {vide p. 96). The dissection of the knee-joint, the ankle-joint, and of the various articulations of the foot may now be proceeded with. In all probability the ligaments have become hard and dry. If this be the case, soak the joints in hot water for an hour or two, and then rub them with a hard brush. The dissection will in this way be greatly facilitated.

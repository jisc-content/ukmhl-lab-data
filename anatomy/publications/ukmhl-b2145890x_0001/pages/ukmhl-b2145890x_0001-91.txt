79 FRONT OF THE THIGH. Lymphatic Glands and Vessels. —The large lymphatic glands in this region should next be dis- sected out from the fatty tissue in which they are embedded. In doing this take care to preserve as many of the minute ducts, which enter and leave the glands, as possible. A small artery and vein can be traced to each gland. The disposition of the glands into two groups will now be evident,—an upper inguinal group along the line of Poupart's ligament, and a lower femoral group, which extends for a short way down the thigh along the line of the internal saphenous vein. In a spare subject the general arrangement of the lymphatic ducts may also be made out. To the femoral group of glands proceed the ducts of the lower limb; to the inguinal glands go the ducts from the genitals, perinaeum, and the surface of the abdomen. In addition to these numerous ducts pass between the various glands and connect them with each other. Saphenous Opening.—This is the opening in the deep fascia through which the saphenous vein passes to effect its junction with the femoral vein. It requires an experienced dissector to display it in a satisfactory manner. Begin by removing the lymphatic glands. In doing this bear in mind that the crural brafich of the genito-crural nerve pierces the fascia lata in the middle line of the thigh about an inch or so below Poupart's ligament. Take care also of the two divisions of the middle cutaneous nerve, which make their appearance in the same line about three inches

204 ABDOMEN. of the vertebral column. It is necessary to bear in mind that the lumbar branches of the aorta as they proceed outwards pass behind this. Separate the right crus of the diaphragm from the aorta, and dissect in the interval between them. Here the receptaculum chyli and the vena azygos major will be found. A chain of lymphatic glands, termed the lumbar glands, will be noticed in relation to the aorta. The only branches of the aorta which are liable to injury are the spermatic arteries. These are two slender arteries which spring from the front of the vessel a short distance below the renal arteries. They are so small that they are apt to be overlooked. The Abdominal Aorta—The abdominal aorta is the direct continuation of the thoracic aorta, and enters the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm. It begins in the mesial plane in front of the last dorsal vertebra, and it ends upon the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra by dividing into the two common iliacs. It therefore pursues an oblique course—slightly inclining to the left as it pro- ceeds downwards. A line drawn between the highest points of the iliac crests would indicate the level of the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta; it takes place opposite the left side of the umbilicus. Most of the structures which lie in front of the abdominal aorta have been removed. In immediate relation to it from above downwards are:—(i.) The solar plexus and the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. (2.) The pancreas and splenic vein. (3.) The third part of the duodenum and the left renal

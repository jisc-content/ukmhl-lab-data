THORACIC CAVITY. to the root of the lung. Upon this it passes out- wards so as to envelope the lung. The smooth, glistening surface of this organ is due to the pleural investment which it thus acquires. When the pleura is stripped from the side of the pericardium the phrenic nerve which lies between them will be brought into view. From the back of the lung the pleura is prolonged over the root of the lung to the posterior aspect of the pericardium, and it no sooner reaches this than it is directed backwards to the sides of the vertebral bodies, from which it passes outwards to clothe the inner aspect of the ribs. The pleural sac of the one side is therefore quite I distinct from the pleural sac of the other side, and the interval which is left between them is called the mediastinum or mediastinal space. This space is j arbitrarily divided into an anterior^ middle^ and posterior part. The anterior mediastinum has already been studied. The posterior mediastinum is bounded in front by the posterior aspect of the pericardium, behind by the bodies of the vertebrae, and upon each side by the pleura as it is directed backwards from the pericardium to the spine. It contains a number of important structures which it is needless to enumerate before ' the dissection of the space is undertaken. The middle mediastinum is that portion of the interpleural space which is occupied by the heart, pericardium, and phrenic nerves. But a superior mediastinum is also somtimes described. The term is applied to that portion of the

85 ABDOMEN. different points-(i.) between the anterior superior iliac spine and the femoral artery, where it will be seen to be attached to Poupart's ligament; along this line also it becomes continuous with the fascia iliaca • (2) opposite the femoral vessels, where it is carried downwards into the thigh behind Poupart's ligament, to form the anterior part of the femoral or crural sheath ; (3.) internal to the femoral vessels, where it is attached to the ilio-pectineal line and the pubic bone, behind the conjoined tendon, with which it is partially blended. Internal Abdominal Ring.-We have seen that the transversalis fascia is pierced by the spermatic cord The opening through which it passes is called the internal ahdominal ring. This opening can only be defined from the front by an artificial dissection —viz by dividing the infundibuliform fascia around the cord, and pushing it upwards with the handle of the knife. The ring thus defined will be observed to lie about half-an-inch above Poupart's ligament, at a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Through the opening the dissector can see the extra-peritoneal fat upon which the transversalis fascia rests, and immediately internal to the opening he will notice the deep epigastric artery, pursuing its oblique course upwards and inwards, and shining through the fascia. If the handle of the knife be now introduced into the ring and carried outwards between the fascia and extra-peritoneal fat, the attachments of the fascia to

SPLENIC VEIN. 167 near the spleen, and is directed from left to right, along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the two anterior layers of the great omentum. It gives branches which ascend to supply both aspects of the stomach, and others which descend into the great omentum, and it ends by anastomosing with the right gastro-epiploic artery. From the above description of the branches of the coeliac axis it will be seen that the stomach is remark- ably rich in blood-vessels. Two proceed from left to rigkt~v\z., the coronary along the lesser curvature, and the left gastro-epiploic along the greater curvature; two, both branches of the hepatic, are directed from' right to leftâ€”Viz., the pyloric, in relation to the lesser curvature; and the right gastro-epiploic, in relation to the greater curvature. The arterial circle is completed on the left by the vasa brevia, which connect the coronary artery with the left gastro-epiploic. The Splenic Vein, formed by the union of the veins which issue from the spleen, runs from left to right behind the pancreas, and at a lower level than the artery of the same name. After crossing the aorta and the root of the superior mesenteric artery It ends in front of the vena cava by joining the superior mesenteric vein to form the vena ports. In Its course between the spleen and the vena port^e it receives the following tributaries veins corre- sponding to the vasa brevia; (2.) the left gastro- epiploic vein ; (3.) pancreatic veins ; (4.) the inferior mesenteric vein ; (5.) some duodenal twigs

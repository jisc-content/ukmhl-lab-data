136 ABDOMEN. liver and back part of the diaphragm, and to tJie left as far as the spleen. It is closed in the following manner :â€” in front, by the two anterior layers of the great omen- tum, by the stomach, and by the gastro-hepatic omen- tum ; behind, by the two posterior layers of the great omentum, by the transverse colon, by the transverse meso-colon, and by the layer which ascends on the posterior wall of the abdomen over the pancreas ; on the left side,hy the spleen and gastro-splenic omentum. In a favourable subject these points can be made out by dividing the two anterior layers of the great omentum along the greater curvature of the stomach, and introducing the hand into the lesser sac. The entire extent of the pouch can thus be explored and its continuity with the greater bag demonstrated by turning the forefinger to the right and bringing it out through the foramen of Winslow, or by passing the forefinger of the other hand into the foramen of Wins- low and making the two fingers meet behind the gastro- hepatic omentum. The peritoneal lining of the abdomen must also be traced in the transverse direction at different levels. Fig- 2$, gives a diagrammatic view of the manner in which it is arranged at the level of the foramen of Winslow or the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Taking the gastro-hepatic omentum as the starting-point, follow the two layers of which this is composed to the right. They become continuous around the hepatic artery and duct and the portal vein forming the right free border of this omentum and the anterior boundaiy of the foramen of Winslow. Following them to the left,

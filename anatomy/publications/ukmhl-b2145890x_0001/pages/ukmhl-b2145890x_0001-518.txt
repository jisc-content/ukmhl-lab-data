292 ABDOMEN. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament is by no means strong. It is composed of a series of short fibres stretching across in front of the joint, and connecting the bones anteriorly. The posterior sacro-iliac ligament is exceedingly strongly marked. It consists of fibrous bands, which connect the rough surface on the posterior part of the lateral aspect of the sacrum with a corresponding rough surface on the ilium behind the auricular sur- face. The oblique ligament is simply a part of the posterior sacro-iliac ligament specially thickened and having a special direction and attachments. Above, it is fixed to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; whilst inferiorly, it is inserted into the lateral tubercle of the third piece of the sacrum. The great sacro-sciatic ligament has a wide attach- ment to the posterior inferior iliac spine and to the side of the sacrum and coccyx. Narrowing consider- ably as it proceeds downwards and forwards, it again expands and is inserted into the inner border of the tuberosity of the ischium. From this it sends upwards a sharp falciform edge, which extends forwards for a short distance upon the ascending ramus of the ischium, and gives attachment to the parietal pelvic fascia. The small sacro-sciatic ligament is triangular in form. By its base it is fixed to the side of the sacrum and coccyx in front of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, the fibres of both mingling together;

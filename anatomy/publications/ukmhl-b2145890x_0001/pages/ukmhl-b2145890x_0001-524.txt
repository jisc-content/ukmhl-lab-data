298 ABDOMEN. Peritoneum.â€”The peritoneum, as it proceeds down- wards from the posterior abdominal wall into the pelvis, comes into relation with the rectum, and gives it a partial covering. The first part of the gut it clothes completely and connects by means of a dis- tinct fold, called the meso-rectum, to the anterior sur- face of the sacrum. Gradually it quits the rectum, leaving first its posterior surface, then its lateral, and finally its anterior surface. The peritoneum is now reflected on to the posterior wall of the upper part of the vagina, upon which it ascends to the posterior sur- face of the uterus, which it covers completely. Reach- ing the fundus of the uterus, it turns over this and descends upon the anterior aspect of the organ. This surface of the uterus it only invests in its upper three- fourths, and is then reflected on to the posterior aspect of the bladder. Whilst the vagina, therefore, receives a partial investment from the peritoneum posteriorly, it is altogether destitute of it anteriorly; and, again, whilst the entire posterior surface of the uterus is covered, the lower fourth of its anterior sur- face is bare, in so far as this membrane is concerned. From each lateral border of the uterus the peritoneum stretches outwards in the form of a wide fold called the broad ligament. This connects the organ to the wall of the pelvis and the iliac fossa. Upon the bladder the peritoneum is carried upwards, and at its apex is conducted to the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall by the urachus. On each side of the viscus it extends outwards as far as the obliterated hypogastric artery, along the line of which

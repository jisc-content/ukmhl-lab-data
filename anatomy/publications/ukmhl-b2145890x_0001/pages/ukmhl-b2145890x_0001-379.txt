153 INTESTINAL CANAL. ovarian) plexus of nerves which accompanies the sper- matic artery. Removal of the Intestines.—The jejunum, ileum, coecum, and colon may now be removed from the abdominal cavity. Apply two ligatures around the upper end of the jejunum, about an inch or so to the left of the point where the superior mesenteric artery crosses the duodenum, and divide the gut between them ; then place two ligatures around the great intes- tine at the junction of the sigmoid flexure and the rectum, and divide it in like manner. The entire in- testinal canal, with the exception of the duodenum and rectum, can now be taken away by carefully severing the blood-vessels and peritoneal folds which hold it in position. In cutting through the two layers of the great omentum which extend from the trans- verse colon to the stomach, keep the knife close to the gut so as to avoid injury to the vessels in relation to the greater curvature of the stomach. As soon as the intestines are detached they should be taken to the sink and the ligatures removed. The small intestine should be separated from the great intestine by dividing the ileum about six inches from the point where it enters the coecum, and, the remains of the mesentery having been taken away from the small intestine by means of the scissors, both should be thoroughly cleaned out by allowing the water from the tap to run freely through them. Coats of the Small Intestine.—A small portion of the jejunum should now be opened up and stretched

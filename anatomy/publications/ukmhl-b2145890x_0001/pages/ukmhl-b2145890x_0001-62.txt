CQ UPPER LIMB. found in relation to the wrist. Note how it is crossed by the three extensor tendons of the thumb and smks from view between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Its branches are very minute and can only be dissected in a well-injected subject. They areâ€”(i) The posterior carpal, which runs m- wards under the extensor tendons to join the pos- terior carpal branch of the ulnar. From the arch thus formed two twigs are given to the third and fourth interosseous spaces. (2.) The first dorsal interossecaa branch to the second interosseous space. (3.) ihe dorsalis indicis. (4.) The dorsalis pollicis-someUmes two in number. Posterior Annular Ligament.-The oblique direc- tion of this ligament is owing to its being attached to the styloid process of the radius on the outside and the hook of the unciform bone and the pisiform bone on the inside. These attachments interfore in no way with the free movements of pronation and supination. Contrast this ligament with the anterior annular ligament. In the latter case there is formed a single compartment or tunnel for the nine flexor tendons; here processes or septa pass from deep surface of the ligament to the ridges on the back of radius, and six compartments are formed, each containing its own tendon or tendons. Open these compartments and note the tendons which belong to each and the synovial membrane lining the compartments. Extensor Tendons.-FoUow these tendons to their insertions. In the case of those which go to

GANGLIATED CORD OF SYMPATHETIC. walls of the tubes. The further he traces the tubes into the lung, the scarcer and finer will these cartilaginous flakes and nodules become. Gangliated Cord of the Sympatheticâ€”The dissector should next turn his attention to the thoracic portion of the sympathetic nervous system. In order to expose it he must strip the parietal pleura from the sides of the vertebrae and the inner surface of the ribs. He will then observe the gangliated cord extending through the thoracic cavity. It lies upon the heads of the ribs and the intervening intercostal spaces and has an appearance somewhat similar to a knotted string. It requires considerable care to make a good dissection of the various ganglia and their branches. The thoracic ganglia are usually twelve in number, and, with the ex- ception of the two lowest, they are placed one upon the head of each of the upper ten ribs. Towards the diaphragm the cord inclines forwards, so that the two lowest ganglia come to lie upon the bodies of the two last dorsal vertebrae. The first ganglion is consider- ably larger than those which succeed it, and they are all linked together by intervening nervous cords. Supe- riorly, the thoracic part of the sympathetic is continu- ous with the cervical sympathetic ; whilst inferiorly, it becomes continuous with the abdominal portion of the sympathetic by passing behind the ligamentum arcu- atum internum of the diaphragm. The branches which spring from the ganglia may be divided into an external and an mternal series. The external series are branches of communication O

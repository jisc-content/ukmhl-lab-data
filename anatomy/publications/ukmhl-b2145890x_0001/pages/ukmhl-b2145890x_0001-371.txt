THE MESENTERY PROPER. I45 branches of the superior mesenteric artery it is neces- sary to remove also the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon and the peritoneum which proceeds on the posterior wall of the abdomen towards the coecum and ascending colon. Follow the main trunk of the artery upwards to its origin from the aorta, by raising the lower border of the pancreas. Superior Mesenteric Artery. — The superior mesenteric artery springs from the front of the abdom- inal aorta about a quarter of an inch below the coeliac axis. At its origin it is covered by the pancreas, and crossed by the splenic vein. Emerging from under cover of the pancreas, it crosses the transverse part of the duodenum, near where it becomes the jejunum, and the left renal vein, and then enters the mesentery proper. Between the two layers of the mesentery it takes a slightly curved course towards the right iliac fossa, where it ends by anastomosing with one of its own branches. The convexity of the curve which it describes is directed to the left, and the concavity to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesen- teric vein, which lies upon its right side, and by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves which surrounds It closely. The following branches proceed from the superior mesenteric artery:— (i.) Inferior pancreatico-duodenal. (2.) Branches to the jejunum ) and ileum. j ^^^^ intestini tenuis. (3.) Branches to the great ( ^J^^-^^l^^-. intestine. i ^'^^^ I Middle colic. PART II.

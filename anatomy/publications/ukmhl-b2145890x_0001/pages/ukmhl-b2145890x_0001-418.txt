192 ABDOMEN. be found to have the following position from before backwards:— (i.) Branches of the renal vein. (2.) Branches of the renal artery. (3.) Ureter or renal duct. In detailing the relations of the kidney, we shall first take note of those which are common to both. In front, the kidney is in contact on each side with the colon—on the right side with the ascending colon, and on the left side with the descending colon. The peri- toneum has a very limited and a very variable relation to this surface. Behind, the posterior surface rests upon the pillar of the diaphragm and upon the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles, separated from these, however, by the fascia which covers them. Superiorly, the upper end is capped by the suprarenal capsule, which also descends for a short distance on its anterior surface; whilst inferiorly, the lower pointed extremity is separated by a short interval from the iliac crest. It is in this interval on the left side that the operation of colotomy is performed. The relations which are special to each kidney are : (i.) On the right side, the anterior surface of the kidney is in contact with the second part of the duodenum as well as the colon, and its upper end is in relation to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver upon which it leaves its mark in the form of a depression. (2.) On the left side, the pancreas is in relation to the anterior surface, and the spleen to the upper end of the kidney.

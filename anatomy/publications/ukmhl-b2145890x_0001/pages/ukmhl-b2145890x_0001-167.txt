THORACIC CAVITY. of the pleural sac which forms the lateral boundary of the mediastinal space—to that portion of the membrane which extends from the sternum to the vertebrae ; and, where the root of the lung intervenes, it applies to the pleura which passes from the sternum to the anterior aspect of the root, and from the posterior aspect of the root to the vertebrae. The central piece of the sternum, with the attached costal cartilages, may now be removed, together with the triangularis sterni muscle, the costal pleura, and that portion of the pleura which is in relation to the pericardium. Branches of Internal Mammary.—The intevfial mammary artery will be observed to give off a long slender branch, which accompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. It is called the arteria comes nervi phrenici. Mediastinal and thymic twigs also come from the internal mammary, but these are very minute, and can only be satisfactorily studied when the injection of the body has been more than usually successful. The following, then, are the branches of the internal mammary artery:— (i.) Perforating. (2.) Anterior intercostal. (3.) Comes nervi phrenici. (4.) Mediastinal and thymic. (5.) Musculo-phrenic. (6.) Superior epigastric. Lungs.—The lungs should next occupy the atten- tion of the dissector. He must carefully study their

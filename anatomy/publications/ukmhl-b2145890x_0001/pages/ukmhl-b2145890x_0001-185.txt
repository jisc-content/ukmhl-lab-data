THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. ductus arterios2is—will be observed connecting the root of the left pulmonary artery with the under surface of the transverse portion of the aortic arch. The pulmonary artery may now be slit open, so as to expose the semilunar valve, which guards its orifice. » This incision must be made carefully, and the knife carried upwards through the wall in the interval between two of the segments. Each semilunar seg- ment will be observed to be attached by its convex margin, whilst its concave margin is free. Three minute pouches are thus formed around the mouth of vessel, and the openings of these pouches are directed upwards. A good idea of the valve may be obtained by filling the pouches with cotton wadding. The segments consist of a double layer of endocardium, strengthened by intermediate fibrous tissue, and if the free margins be taken between the finger and thumb a minute nodule of cartilage may be felt about its middle. This is the corpus Arantii. Opposite each segment the wall of the artery shows a slight dilata- tion or bulging, called the sinus of Valsalva. Pulmonary Veins.—The blood is conveyed back to the heart by the pulmonary veins. These have already been studied in the roots of the lungs. Two issue from each lung. The right veins are longer than the left, and pass inwards behind the superior vena cava, the right auricle and the ascending portion of the aortic arch. The left veins pass in front of the descend- mg aorta. If the inferior vena cava be now divided and the heart turned upwards, the pulmonary veins

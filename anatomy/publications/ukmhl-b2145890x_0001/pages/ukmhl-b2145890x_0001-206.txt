194 THORAX. between the ganglia and the intercostal nerves. Two run between each nerve and the corresponding ganghon. These differ in the kind of fibres which compose them. One is chiefly composed of white cerebro-spinal nerve- fibres, the other is mainly formed of grey sympathetic nerve-fibres. Through the agency of these two twigs, then, an interchange of fibres takes place between the intercostal nerve and the sympathetic ganglion. The internal series are branches of distribution. From the upper five or six ganglia the internal branches go to thoracic viscera, whilst in the case of the lozver six eang-lia, the internal branches unite to form the splanchnic nerves which are destined for the supply of abdominal viscera. The thoracic twigs of supply are very small, and are given to the aorta, to the vertebrae and their ligaments, and to the lungs. The pulmonary branches proceed from the third and fourth ganglia, and they enter the posterior pulmonary plexus. The splanchnic nerves are three in number, and are distin- guished by the terms great, small, and smallest The great splanchnic nerve is formed by the union of five roots derived from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ganglia. This description, however, must be regarded as being somewhat arbitraiy, as there is great variability in the number and manner of origin of the roots of this nerve. It is said that under certain circumstances filaments may be followed up- wards upon the sympathetic cord as high as the third or even the first ganglion. The great splanchnic has more the appearance of a cerebro-spinal nerve than a .sympathetic nerve, owing to the large amount of spinal

ANASTOMOSES AROUND THE KNEE-JOINT. 139 also the nerves which supply the joint, and he should avail himself of this opportunity before he proceeds to examine the articulations of the lower limb. Upon the outer aspect of the joint he will find from above downwards the following arteries :— (i.) Descending branch of the external circumflex. (2.) Superior external articular. (3.) Inferior external articular. Upon the inner aspect of the joint there are also three arteries, viz.:— (i.) Articular branch of the anastomotica magna. (2.) Superior internal articular. (3.) Inferior internal articular. Ascending upon the anterior aspect of the joint will be found the recurrent tibial artery. These seven arteries ramify upon the anterior and lateral aspects of the knee-joint and effect very complete anastomoses. The dissector should very particularly examine the relations of the articular branches of the popliteal artery. Each superior articular artery as it winds round the femur will be seen to pierce the inter- muscular septum of its own side. The superior internal articular will also be observed to pass under cover of the round tendon of the adductor magnus. Each inferior articular artery passes under cover of the lateral ligament of its own side. Articular Nerves of the Knee-joint.—An arti- cular nerve will be found accompanying each of the seven anastomosing arteries. In addition to these,

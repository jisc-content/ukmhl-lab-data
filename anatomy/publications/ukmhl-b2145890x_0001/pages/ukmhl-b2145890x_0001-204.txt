THORAX. thorax, the thoracic duct pursues a somewhat wavy or flexuous course. It frequently breaks up into two or more branches, which unite again to form a single trunk. It is provided at intervals with valves of two segments, and these, when the duct is injected, give it a beaded or nodulated appearance. The valves are more especially numerous in the upper part of the duct. Removal of Lungs.â€”The lungs may now be removed by dividing the trachea about an inch above its bifurcation. An examination of the trachea and bronchi will show that they are not uniformly cylin- drical tubes, but that they are flattened posteriorly. At first sight the cartilaginous rings which are embedded in the external fibro-elastic coat appear to describe complete circles around the tubes. This is not the case, however; the rings are deficient behind, and are therefore horse-shoe shaped. The posterior third of both trachea and bronchi is entirely membranous and muscular in its structure. The bronchi should be traced into the lungs and their manner of subdivision studied. As a general rule, they branch dichotomously, but in some few cases a tube may be seen to end by dividing into three, and it is by no means uncommon to observe one or more collateral branches springing from the side of a main trunk. Within the pulmonary substance the tubes be- come cylindrical, and the student will not fail to notice that the cartilaginous rings have now broken up into bars and flakes, which are scattered irregularly around

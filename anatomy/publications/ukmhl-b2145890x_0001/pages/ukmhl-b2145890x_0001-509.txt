283 URETHRA. Immediately in front of the highest part of the verumontanum, the mucous membrane dips back- wards and upwards behind the middle lobe of the prostate, and between the lateral lobes, so as to form a small recess or cul-de-sac. This is the sinus poailaris or the iitriculus. Gauge its extent by means of a probe. It will be observed to be from a quarter to half-an-inch long, and to be very narrow at its orifice, but to widen out considerably towards its blind extremity. It is of interest, both from a developmental and a surgical point of view. It is the representative in the male, of the uterus and vagina in the female. Practically, it is important, because in some cases it is large enough to entangle the point of a small catheter or bougie. The dissector should now pass bristles along the common ejaculatory ducts. They will be observed to run downwards between the middle and lateral lobes of the prostate. Finally, entering the wall of the sinus pocularis, they open by slit-like apertures, just within the margin of its orifice. Owing to the presence of the verumontanum on the floor of the canal, and the prostatic sinus upon each side of it, a transverse section of the prostatic portion of the urethra presents a crescentic figureâ€”the con- vexity of the crescent being directed forwards and the concavity backwards. As old age approaches, the prostate is veiy liable to become enlarged, and the most important result of this is the effect which it exerts upon the urethra. When the enlargement is uniform, the prostatic portion of the canal , is simply elongated ;

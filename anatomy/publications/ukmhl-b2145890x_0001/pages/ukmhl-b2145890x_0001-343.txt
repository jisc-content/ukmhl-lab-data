119 THE SPLEEN. with the diaphragm, and bound to it by the peritoneum, which passes from the one to the other. In the male subject the anterior sharp border projects very slightly, if at all, below the ribs,, but in females and children it almost always extends a short distance beyond them. The concave under surface is in relation to a number of important structures. Thus the left lobe overlaps the stomach, whilst in contact with the inferior surface of the right lobe are—(i.) the gall-bladder, which is tightly bound down to it by the peritoneum ; (2.) the duodenum, or commencement of the small intestine; (3.) the hepatic flexure of the colon; and (4.) the right kidney and suprarenal capsule. Even in health the position of the liver is variable. From its intimate connection with the diaphragm it is easy to understand how it must rise and fall with every respiratory act. Again, on account of its great weight the posture of the body must have a slight effect upon its position. Displacement of the liver from artificial causes, such as tight lacing in females, is by no means uncommon. In these cases the pressure upon the lower part of the chest forces the liver downwards. The gall-bladder should be examined in connection with the liver. It lies in the right hypochondrium, on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, to which it is tightly bound by the peritoneum. The Spleen.—The spleen lies deep in the left hypochondrium., and is altogether out of sight in the undisturbed condition of the viscera. By drawing the stomach to the right, and thrusting the hand into the

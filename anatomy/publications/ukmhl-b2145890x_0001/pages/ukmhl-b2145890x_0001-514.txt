ABDOMEN. its various parts are held together by the following articulations :â€” ' (i.) Lumbo-sacral. (2.) Sacro-coccygeal. is-) Coccygeal. (4-) Sacro-iliac. (5-) Pubic. Lumbo-sacral Articulation.-The junction be- tween the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum is- affected by an amphiarthrodialjoint, which connects the body of the vertebra to the base of the sacrum, and by two diarthrodial joints, between the two pairs of articular processes. The ligaments which take part in holding the bones in position are (i.) The capsular, (2.) The anterior and posterior common vertebral. (3-) The ligamenta subflava. (4.) The inter and supra-spinous. (5.) The sacro-vertebral, or lumbo-sacral. (6.) The iho-lumbar. The capsular ligaments surround the articulations formed by the apposition of the articular processes, and each is lined by a synovial membrane. The anterior common ligament of the vertebral column is continued downwards over the anterior aspect of the body of the last lumbar vertebra to the anterior aspect of the first segment of the sacrum. In a similar manner the posterior common ligament is pro- longed downwards within the spinal canal, over the posterior aspect of the body of the last lumbar vertebra,

49 FEMALE PERINEUM. its orifice on the vestibule. It measures about one and a-half inches in length, and has an oblique and slightly-curved course from above downwards and forwards. The concavity of the curve is directed forwards. So close is its relation to the anterior wall of the vagina, that it may almost be said to be embedded in it. At the present stage of the dissection, the urethral canal is seen covered by the fibres of the compressor urethras muscle. The leading peculiarity of the female urethra is its great dilatability. Cases are on record in which vesical calculi weighing from two to four ounces have traversed it, and thus escaped from the bladder. It thus happens that in the extraction of foreign substances from the female bladder, it is rarely necessary to have recourse to the knife. Compressor Urethrse.—This muscle differs some- what from the corresponding muscle in the male. It has the same origin (viz., from the inner aspect of the pubic arch at the junction of the pubic and ischial rami), and it also divides into two bundles ; but these have not the same intimate relation to the urethra. The upper or anterior bundle spreads out upon the upper or anterior surface of the urethra, whilst the lower or posterior bundle spreads out upon the side and posterior aspect of the vagina. In the middle line they meet with the corresponding bundles of the opposite muscle, and thus the urethra and vagina are both included in a kind of deep sphincter. PART II. • E

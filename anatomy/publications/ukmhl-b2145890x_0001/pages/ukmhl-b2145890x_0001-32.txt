20 UPPER LIMB. upper part of the axillary space is opened into, and the contents with a little dissection may be exposed. The axillary artery is the most important object. Lying to its inner side will be seen the axillary vein, and above and external to it three large brachial nerves. Crossing behind the artery is the external respiratory nerve. The thoracic axis artery will be seen to be a branch of this part of the axillary trunk, and a second branch, the superior thoracic, may be followed out. Lastly, the cephalic vein must be traced to its junction with the axillary vein. Reflection of the Sternal Portion of the Pector- aiis Major.—This constitutes the next step in the dissection. Divide the muscle about its middle and throw the two parts outwards and inwards. Twigs from both the external anterior thoracic and the internal anterior thoracic nerves will be observed to enter the muscle. The latter, to reach their destina- tion, pierce the pectoralis minor. ^ Reflection of the Pectorahs Minor.—This is effected by cutting the muscle midway between its origin and insertion. Trace now the internal and external anteri&r thoracic nerves to their origin from the inner and outer cords of the brachial plexus. The upper subscapular nerve sinking into the upper part of the subscapularis muscle can now be displayed. Section of the Clavicle.—The dissector of the head and neck must help in this dissection. It sim- ply consists in reflecting the subclavius muscle and removing the middle third of the clavicle by means

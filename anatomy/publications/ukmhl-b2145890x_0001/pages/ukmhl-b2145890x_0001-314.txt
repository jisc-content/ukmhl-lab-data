ABDOMEN. 90 riorly they effect communications with the lumbar arteries. The abdominal branches of the lumbar arteries are usually four in number, and ramify between the same two muscles as the preceding vessels, but at a lower level in the abdominal wall. Anteriorly they anas- tomose with the epigastric arteries ; above with the intercostal arteries ; and below with the deep circum- flex iliac and the ilio-lumbar. It is rare to find the intercostal and lumbar arteries injected in an ordinary dissecting-room subject. The A||ep Epigastric Artery, a branch of the external iliac, is a vessel of some size, and takes origin about a quarter or half-an-inch above Poupart's liga- ment. At present it is seen shining through the fascia transversalis and forming the outer boundary of Hessel- bach's triangle. Divide the fascia transversalis along its course and it will be seen to be accompanied by two veins. Study the course and relations of this vessel. At first it descends to the level of Poupart's ligament, and then curves forwards so as to reach the anterior aspect of the peritoneum. It is now directed upwards and inwards to the deep surface of the rectus. Here it enters the rectal sheath, and proceeding vertically upwards, ends near the lower margin of the thorax in branches which sink into the substance of the muscle and anastomose with the superior epigastric and intercostal arteries. In the first part of its course, the deep epigastric lies in the extra-peritoneal fat between the peritoneum

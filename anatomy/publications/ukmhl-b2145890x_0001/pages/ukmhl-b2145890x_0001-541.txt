FEMALE PELVIS. which anastomose with branches of the uterine artery. The other arteries of the female pelvis are identical with those of the male, and therefore it is needless to repeat the description which will be found at p. 258. Veins of the Pelvis.â€”Very few facts require to be added to those which are given regarding the veins of the male pelvis (p. 264). Of course there is no prostatic 1^ plexus of veins in the female, and therefore the dorsal vein of the clitoris ]o'ms the vesical plexus. Both the vagina and uterus are surrounded by large tortuous veins, constituting a vaginal and a uterine plexus. From the former, the blood is drained away into the internal iliac vein, whilst from the uterine plexus it is chiefly carried away by the ovarian veins. Pelvic Diaphragm. This is described at p. 265. The dissector should note, however, that the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle, which in the male are connected with the prostate, pass downwards upon the lateral aspect of the vagina and give it support (Fig. 52). The pelvic floor of the accoucheur is somewhat different from that of the anatomist. To the former the uterus is the all- important organ of the pelvic cavity, and the other contents are of importance merely in so far as they influence it. The pelvic floor, therefore, has recently been described (Hart) as consisting of an anterior triangular portion, made up of the bladder and anterior vaginal wall, and a posterior sacral portion. During parturition, the anterior or pubic part is

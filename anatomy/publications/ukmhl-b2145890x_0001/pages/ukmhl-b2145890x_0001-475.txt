249 PELVIC VISCERA. The first part of the rectum, about three and a-half inches long, extends from the left sacro-iliac articula- tion obliquely downwards, backwards, and to the right, and ends in the mesial plane upon the body of the third sacral vertebra. In this part of its course, the rectum is completely clothed by peritoneum, and is connected to the anterior surface of the sacrum by a short peritoneal fold called the meso-rectum. Between the two layers of this fold, the superior, haemorrhoidal artery will be observed descending to supply the gut. The first, part of the rectum is in relation posteriorly to the sacrum, the left pyriformis muscle, and the left sacral plexus of nerves, separated from them, however, by the peritoneum. In relation to its left side are the left ureter and branches of the left internal iliac vessels. In front it is separated from the posterior surface of the bladder by the recto- vesical peritoneal pouch, and, it may be, by some coils of small intestine contained within this pouch. The second part of the rectum, about three inches in length, descends in the middle line to the tip of the coccyx. It is in contact with the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and consequently describes a curve, the concavity of which is directed forwards. The peritoneum at first clothes it anteriorly and laterally; soon, however, it leaves the sides of the gut, and finally (about an inch above the end of this part of the rectum) quits it altogether, and is re- flected on to the bladder. Below the reflection of the peritoneum the rectum is in relation anteriorly to the base of the bladder. Only a small triangular

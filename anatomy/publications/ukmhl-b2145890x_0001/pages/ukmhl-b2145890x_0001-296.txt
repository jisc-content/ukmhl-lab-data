72 ABDOMEN. aponeurosis of the internal oblique splits into two layers —a superficial and a deep. The superficial aponeurotic layer passes in front of the rectus, and has already been seen to fuse with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The deep layer is carried inwards be- hind the rectus, and becomes incorporated with the subjacent aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle. But this arrangement does not hold good lower down than a point about midway between the umbilicus and the pubes. Below this point the tendon does not split, but passes entirely in front of the rectus, to join the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is very important to mark exactly the relation which the lower part of the muscle bears to the sper- matic cord. At first the cord lies under cover of the fleshy fibres, but it soon emerges, clothed by the cremaster muscle, and as it is continued downwards and inwards to the external abdominal ring, it lies in front of the conjoined tendon. Especially note the position of the conjoined tendon in relation to the external abdominal ring. It lies immediately behind it, and gives strength to this otherwise weak point in the abdominal parietes. Cremaster Muscle.—This muscle supports the testicle and spermatic cord, and is consequently peculiar to the male sex. It arises from the outer half of Poupart's Hgament, but it also derives fibres from the lower border of the internal oblique, and rarely from the lower border of the trans- versalis muscle. The fleshy fibres descend upon

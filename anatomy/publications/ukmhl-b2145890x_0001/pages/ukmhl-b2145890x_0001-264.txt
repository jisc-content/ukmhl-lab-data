ABDOMEN. 40 variable. Sometimes it is present in the shape of a circular septum pierced in the centre by a round opening; again it may be cribriform or fringed along its free margin. Lastly, it may present the two extremes—i.e., it maybe absent altogether, or constitute a complete septum across the opening of the vaginal canal. In the latter case most awkward results ensue from the retention of the menstrual fluid. When lacerated its position is marked by certain rounded elevations which have received the name of carunciilce myrtifonnes. Having mastered these facts regarding the external organs of generation, the dissector should practise the passing of the female catheter, and afterwards introduce a speculum into the vagina, so as to obtain a view of the os uteri. The difficulty in passing the catheter arises from the fact that the operation must be conducted without any exposure of the person. Place the forefinger of the left hand in the orifice of the vagina with its palmar surface directed upwards towards the pubes. If the instrument be now passed along this finger and the point raised slightly when it reaches the entrance to the vagina, a little manipulation will cause it to enter the urethra. When the speculum is introduced into the vagina the points to be noted in connection with the os uteri are:—(i.) the small size of the opening; (2.) the two rounded and thick lips which bound this aperture. In the virgin the opening is circular, but in women who have borne children it is somewhat transverse.

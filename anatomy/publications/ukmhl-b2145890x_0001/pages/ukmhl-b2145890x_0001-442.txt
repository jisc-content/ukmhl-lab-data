ABDOMEN. 2l6 quadratus lumborum, bear in mind that the last dorsal nerve runs outwards in front of this muscle, close to the lower border of the last rib, and that the ilio-hypo- gastric and ilio-inguinal nerves cross it obliquely at a lower level. Quadratus Lumborum.—This muscle arises from the ilio-lumbar ligament and from the crest of the ilium behind it. Narrowing slightly as it passes up- wards, it is inserted into the inner half of the last rib, behind the ligamentum arcuatum externum, and by four tendinous slips into the tips of the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebrae. The Psoas Magnus.—This muscle has three distinct modes of origin from the side of the vertebral column:—(I.) by five fleshy processes from the anterior surfaces and lower borders of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae close to their roots ; (2.) by five slips, each of which arises from the inter- vertebral disc and the contiguous margins of the bodies of two vertebrae—the first slip springing from the last dorsal and the first lumbar vertebra and the intervening disc, and that last slip from the two lower lumbar vertebrae and their intervening disc ; (3.) from four tendinous arches which bridge across the four lumbar arteries and protect these vessels from the pressure of the contracting muscle. The psoas tapers somewhat as it extends down- wards along the brim of the pelvis, and a tendon appears on its outer border, which affords attachment to the fibres of the iliacus.

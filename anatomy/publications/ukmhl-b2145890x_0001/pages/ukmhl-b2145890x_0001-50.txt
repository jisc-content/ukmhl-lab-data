UPPER LIMB. through the forearm. It is closely accompanied by the vena, comites. In order that its posterior relations may be clearly made out the various '"-^l- attachment to and clothing the anterior aspect of the radius must be cleaned. The branches of th,s ve se, are-f I ) The radial recurrent, which we have^already seen • (2.) Musa.lar branches comingloff at various ooints- (3.) Superficialis vol^, springing from the artery a short distance above the wrist and pas^ng downwards towards the ball of the thumb; (4.) The anterior carpal. Superficial Muscles—Now clean the muscles, •beginning with the pronator radii teres and its two heads of origin, and then working successively at the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the flexor carpi ulnar^. The supinator longus, which lies along the outer side of the limb, may also be cleaned at the same time. Reaching the lower third of the forearm, the dissector will observe that the flexor tendons, as they pass under cover of the anterior annular ligament, are enveloped by a loose bursal sac. A good view of this may be obtained by pulling the tendons upwards. The sac must on no account be removed or even punctured. Ulnar Artery.-Although this vessel in the first part of its course passes obliquely under cover of those muscles which take common origin from the internal condyle of the humerus, its relations can be readi y studied without reflecting any of them. It is merely necessary to slit up the intermuscular septum between

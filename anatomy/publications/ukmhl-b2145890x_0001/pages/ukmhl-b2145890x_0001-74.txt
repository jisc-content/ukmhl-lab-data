LOWER LIMB. 62 distributed under cover of the gluteus medius. It becomes necessaiy, therefore, to reflect this muscle. Except where it is attached to the crest, the gluteus medius can be very readily detachdd from the dorsum ilii with the handle of the knife. Its inferior limit of origin is clearly indicated by a large artery which runs along the superior curved line on the dorsum ilii —viz., the superior branch of the deep division of the gluteal. In throwing the muscle downwards, branches from the superior gluteal nerve and from the deep division of the gluteal artery will be seen to enter its deep surface, and it will be further observed that, ante- riorly, it is more or less fused with the gluteus minimus. Follow out the gluteal nerve and artery. Note the branch of the nerve which enters the gluteus minimus, and also the twig which passes outwards to gain the tensor fasciae femoris. The supeidor and inferior branches of the deep gluteal artery must in like manner be traced to their terminations. In the interval between the pyriformis and superior gemellus, two arteries with their accompanying veins and six nerves issue from the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. r (i.) Sciatic.

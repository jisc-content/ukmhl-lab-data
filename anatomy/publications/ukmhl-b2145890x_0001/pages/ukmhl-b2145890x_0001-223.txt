ABDOMEN. When the body is brought into the Rooms, it is first placed in the lithotomy position (PI. II.) Astout cord or bandage is doubled and passed in the form of a running noose over each hand of the subject, so as to grasp the wrist when tightened. The hands are then drawn downwards and the feet upwards until the palm of each hand rests upon the outer aspect and dorsum of the corresponding foot. In this position they must be securely fixed by passing the cord once or twice round the instep, and then tying a knot upon the inner aspect of the foot. The subject must now be drawn towards the end of the table until the breech projects slightly over the edge. A block is intro- duced under the pelvis, and the cords carried down- wards and fastened on each side to the leg of the table, so as to keep the lower limbs well apart from each other. A third cord must next be passed behind the flexed knee-joints, and then round the neck of the subject, and tightened so as to flex the thighs upon the abdomen. In this position the body is retained for one day, and during this time the dissector of the abdomen is expected to dissect the perineum. The PART II. B

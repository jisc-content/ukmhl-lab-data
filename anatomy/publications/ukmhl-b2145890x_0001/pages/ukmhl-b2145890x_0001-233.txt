MALE PERINEUM. 9 cleaned it will be seen to consist of a thin stratum of muscular fibres surrounding the orifice of the rectum. Behind it is attached to the tip of the coccyx and to the recto-coccygeal ligament; in /"mz/it is fixed to the central point of the perineum. The fibres, in passing between these two points of attachment, encircle the anal orifice and constitute a true sphincter muscle. It draws its nervous supply from two sources—viz., the fourth sacral nerve and the inferior hcemorrhoidal nerve. Ischio-rectal Fossa.—Although the rectum is the largest and most important object which is contained within the posterior portion of the perineum, it does not fill up the entire extent of the rectal triangle. An interval or recess is left upon each side of the rectum —between it and the ischium—and to this recess is given the name of the ischio-rectal fossa (Fig. 3, p. 12). In shape the ischio-rectal fossa is pyramidal, the apex of the pyramid being directed upwards towards the pelvic cavity, and the base downwards towards the integuments. Boundaries.—Whilst the term ischio-rectaV is applied to this fossa, it must be borne in mind that neither the ischium nor the rectum enter directly into the formation of its walls. Both are separated from the space by fascial and muscular layers. Upon the inner aspect of the ischium is the obturator internus muscle, and this again is covered by the parietal or obturator layer of the pelvic fascia as it is continued down to be attached to the tuberosity of the ischium and the great sacro-sciatic ligament.

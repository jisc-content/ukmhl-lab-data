51 ABDOMINAL WALL. corpus cavernosum, and runs forwards with the artery of the same name between the crura to reach the dorsum of the chtoris. Dorsal Vessels and Nerves of the Clitoris — On the dorsum of the cHtoris a Httle dissection will display the dorsal vein occupying the groove in the middle line, with a do7'sal artery and nerve lying upon each side of it. The arteries and nerves should be traced forwards to their distribution in the glans. The dorsal vein takes origin in the glans. As it proceeds backwards it receives certain superficial veins and also tributaries from the corpora cavernosa. At the root of the clitoris it dips downwards between the crura, and piercing the triangular ligament about half-an-inch below the subpubic ligament, is con- tinued backwards into the pelvis to join the plexus of veins around the neck of the bladder. ABDOMINAL WALL. On the fifth day after the dissection of the perineum is completed, the body is placed upon its back, with blocks under the chest and pelvis, and the dissectors of the abdomen begin the dissection of the abdominal wall (PI. III.) External Anatomy.—It is well, however, before proceeding to the actual dissection of the part, that they should bestow some attention upon the general configuration and bony prominences of the region. If the subject is obese the abdomen presents a smooth,

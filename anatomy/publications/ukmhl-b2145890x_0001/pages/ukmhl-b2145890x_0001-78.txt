66 LOWER LIMB. A good-sized block should, in the first place, be inserted under the knee, so as to support the limb, and render the muscles which bound the space tense. In the study of an anatomical space, the structures which we meet with in our dissection should be examined in a definite order. The coverings of the space should first engage our attention ; then we should proceed to define the boundaries; next we should dissect out and isolate the contents; lastly, the floor should be cleaned, and the parts entering into its formation recognised {vide p. 31). Coverings—Reflection of ^Ym—Incisions—{\:) A vertical incision along the middle line of the limb beeinnine about five inches above, and terminating about four inches below the bend of the knee ; (2.) A transverse incision at the upper end of the mesial incision ; (3.) A transverse incision at the lower extremity of the mesial incision. The two transverse incisions should extend almost half way round the limb. (PI. I., and PI. III. p. 2.) Two flaps of skin are thus mapped out, and these must be raised and thrown the one inwards and the other outwards. Superficial Fascia—External Saphenous Vein- Branches of Small Sciatic Nerve.—The fatty layer upon which the skin rests is now brought into view, and the cutaneous nerves and vessels must be secured. First look for a small nei-ve—a branch of the small sciatic—which passes downwards over the space near the middle line, and when this is found, dissect out

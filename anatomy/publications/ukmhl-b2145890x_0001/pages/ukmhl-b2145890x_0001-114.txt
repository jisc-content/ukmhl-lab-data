LOWER LIMB. 102 which surround it. Manipulate the Hmb and note the effect which the different movements have upon the different parts of the capsule. The attachment of the deep layer of the ilio-tibial band of fascia lata to the capsule can now be demonstrated, and it should be observed that this lamina of fascia is rendered very tense when the limb is slightly abducted and rotated outwards and the thigh slightly flexed. Reflect the tensor fasciae femoris and divide the cap- sular ligament first in front and then behind the joint. The head of the femur can now be withdrawn from the acetabulum, and by cutting through the ligamen- tum teres and the obturator externus muscle the limb can be removed from the trunk. Before doing this, however, the student should carefully study the anatomy of the joint. The limb should now be carried to one of those tables which are set aside for the dissection of separate parts, and after the student has again identified the several muscles of the thigh and studied their attach- ments, he should cut away the great bulk of them, leaving only a small portion of each where it is attached to the bone. The vastus externus and crureus, how- ever, should be retained intact. In the dissection of the leg the student should recognise four regions, viz. :— (i.) An Anterior tibio-fibular region—y^c^ embraces those structures which lie in front of the interos- seous membrane, and between the two bones of the leg.

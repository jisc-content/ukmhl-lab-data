GLUTEAL REGION. 6l externus will be revealed as it passes round the neck of the femur to reach the digital fossa. Lastly, the origin of the hamstring muscles from the tuber ischii,. and the upper part of the vastus externus in relation to the root of the great trochanter, should be noted. In each interval formed by the adjacent margins of these muscles, blood-vessels or nerves, or both, are to be found. Before proceeding to the dissection of these,, however, it is well that the student should renew his acquaintance with the skeletal peculiarities of this region. Let him obtain a dried pelvis with the liga- ments in situ, and study carefully the position and boundaries of the great and small sciatic notches, and how they are converted into foramina by the small and great sacro-sciatic ligaments. Through these foramina most important structures issue from the interior of the pelvis into the gluteal region. With the knowledge thus acquired, let him return to his dissection and dissect out the blood-vessels and nerves of the region. Gluteal Artery and Superior Gluteal Nerve.â€” In the interval between the pyriformis and the gluteus medius, the gluteal artery and the superior gluteal nerve will be seen to emerge from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The artery at once divides into a superficial and deep division. The dis- tribution of the former has already been noted. It has been seen to sink into the deep surface of the gluteus maximus. The nerve and the deep division of the artery are

ABDOMEN. of the lumbar vertebra. Trace it outwards and it will be noticed to join the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle. From these connec- tions the dissector will understand that this fascia is simply the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. But what are its superior and inferior attachments? Above, it is fixed to the last rib, and is thickened so as to form the ligamentiim arcuatum externum; whilst inferiorly, it is attached to the ilio-lumbar ligament. The quad- ratus lumborum muscle, therefore, is enclosed m a sheath formed anteriorly by the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia, and posteriorly by the middle lamella of the lumbar fascia (Fig. lo, p. 77)- The Fascia covering the Psoas and Ihacus is one continuous aponeurotic sheet. Ahom the level of the crest of the ilium, where it is merely in relation to the psoas, it is thin and narrow. Here it is attached externally to the fascia covering the quadratus lum- borum, whilst internally it is fixed to the spine by a series of fibrous arches which bridge over the lumbar arteries. Superiorly, it has been seen to form the thickened band termed the ligamentum arcuatum internum. Below, the fascia expands so as to cover both the psoas and the iliacus, and, at the same time, it becomes much denser and thicker. Here it receives the name of the fascia iliaca, and presents most important connections. The external iliac vessels he upon it, whilst the anterior crural nerve lies behind it. The genito-crural nerve pierces it, and comes into rela- tion with the external iliac artery. Externally it is

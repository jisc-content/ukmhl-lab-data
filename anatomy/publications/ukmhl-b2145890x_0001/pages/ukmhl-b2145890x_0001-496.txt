2/0 ABDOMEN. the gluteal region below the level of the pyriformis as the great sciatic nerve. This nerve, indeed, may be regarded as the direct continuation of the plexus into the thigh. The sacral plexus rests upon the pyriformis muscle; whilst, anteriorly, it is clothed by parietal pelvic fascia, which separates it from the branches of the internal iliac artery. The following are the branches which proceed from the plexus:â€” (i.) The great sciatic. (2.) The internal pudic. (3.) The small sciatic. (4.) Nerves to the pyri- formis. (5.) Nerve to obturator in- temus and superior gemellus. (6.) Nerve to quadratus fe- moris and inferior gemellus. (7.) Special branches to the gluteus maximus. The great sciatic, the small sciatic, and the internal pudic nerves all leave the pelvis through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and appear in the gluteal region in the interval between the pyriformis and the inferior gemellus. The special branches to the gluteus maximus quit the pelvis at the same point, and enter the deep surface of that muscle. The nerves to tJte pyriformis are usually two in number, and they may spring either from the plexus or from the sacral nerves before they enter the plexus. The nerve to the obturator internus proceeds from that part of the plexus which results from the union of the lumbo-sacral cord with the first sacral nerve.

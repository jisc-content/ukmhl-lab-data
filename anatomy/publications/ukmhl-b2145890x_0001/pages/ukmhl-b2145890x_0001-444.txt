2l8 ABDOMEN. here, however, it lies nearer the middle line, being carried forward by the psoas muscle. On the right side, it is in great part covered by the vena cava, and on both sides the lumbar vessels pass outwards behind it. As a general rule, a small oval ganglion is formed upon the body of each lumbar vertebra. An external and an ifiternal series of branches will be observed to spring from these ganglia. The external branches connect the ganglia with the anterior primary divisions of the lumbar spinal nerves. Two will be found accompanying each lumbar artery. Trace them carefully backwards by cutting through the fibrous arches which bridge over these vessels, and scraping away the fibres of the psoas muscle. They join the lumbar nerves close to the interverte- bral foramina. The internal branches are chiefly given to the aortic plexus, but some will be found passing down- wards in front of the common iliac arteiy to join the hypogastric plexus. Several twigs are also given to the vertebrae and their ligaments. Lumbar Nerves.â€”To bring the anterior primary branches of the lumbar nerves into view, it is necessary to scrape away the psoas muscle. This has already been partially effected in following the connecting sym- pathetic twigs backwards. An occasional branch, the accessory obturator, is very liable to injury unless it be secured at once. When present it will be found descending along the inner border of the psoas.

264 ABDOMEN. already been observed springing from the termination of the abdominal aorta, between the two common iliac arteries. It runs downwards upon the body of the last lumbar vertebra and under cover of the left common iliac vein. Reaching the sacrum, it continues its down- ward course in the mesial plane till it arrives at the coccyx. Here it ends by anastomosing with the lateral sacral arteries, and by sending minute branches to the coccygeal body. From each side it gives off small twigs, which ramify upon the anterior aspect of the sacrum, and inosculate with branches of the lateral sacral arteries. Veins of the Pelvis.—The arrangement of the veins in the pelvis corresponds in a great measure with that of the arteries ; still there are some import- ant points of difference, viz.:— (i.) The dorsal vein of the penis, instead of joining the pudic vein, proceeds backwards, divides into two, and enters the prostatic plexus of veins. (2.) The ilio-lumbar and the lateral sacral veins, as a general rule, pour their blood into the common iliac veins. (3.) The veins around the prostate, bladder, and lower end of the rectum are exceedingly large and numerous, and constitute dense plexuses, which freely communicate with each other. The prostatic and vesical plexuses have already been noticed. They are directly continuous, and the blood is drained from them by the vesical veins. The hcemorrhoidal plexus surrounds the lower third of the rectum

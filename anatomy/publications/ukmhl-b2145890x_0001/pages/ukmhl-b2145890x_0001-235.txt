MALE PERINEUM. filled up by a mass of fat which is prolonged upwards into it from the superficial fascia. The soft pliable nature of this fat readily allows of the distension of the rectum. Embedded in its midst are certain blood- vessels and nerves. Crossing the fossa from its outer to its inner wall are the inferior hcBinorrhoidal vessels and nerves; entering the fossa at its posterior part is the perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve; whilst in the anterior part of the space will be found the com- mencement of the posterior superficial perineal nerve (Fig. 3, p. 12). Dissection.â€”Begin by exposing the posterior mar- gin of the gluteus maxiinus muscle. Take a point a short distance to the outside of the tuber ischii and another in the middle line about an inch above the tip of the coccyx, and cut boldly down through the super- ficial fascia, in a line between these points, until the fleshy fibres become visible. Winding round the lower margin of the muscle so as to gain its superficial aspect, you will recognise a few small arteries and nerves. The arteries are derived from the inferior JuEmorrhoidal vessels, or from the sciatic artery, whilst the nerves are offsets from the small sciatic nerve. Both are destined for the supply of the skin in the lower part of the gluteal region. . Having secured these vessels and nerves, clean the lower margin of the gluteus maximus, and then proceed to dissect the ischio-rectal fossa. If the subject is obese, a con- siderable quantity of fat may be removed at once without endangering the inferior hemorrhoidal

LOWER LIMB. 92 Femoral Vessels — Sartorius Muscle. — The sartorius should now be cleaned throughout its whole extent and then drawn aside, so that we may be able to trace the femoral vessels in their course down the thigh. Note the deep recess in which they lie—a recess bounded by the adductor muscles on the inside and by the vastus internus upon the outside. Observe further how this is converted into a triangular canal by a strong fibrous membrane which stretches across it. The tunnel thus formed is Hunter's canal Examine carefully the fibrous expan- v.e.

Ihe femoral artery, the femoral vein, and the long saphenous nerve are seen occupying the canal At the point of section the nerve lies in front and slightly to the outside of the artery ; the vein lies behind and slightly to the outside of the artery. sion which closes in the canal anteriorly. Trace it upwards and it will be seen to become thin and ill- defined ; follow it downwards and it becomes dense,

226 ABDOMEN. pelvis there are placed certain muscles. Posteriorly, upon the anterior aspect of the sacrum, are the pyriformes muscles; laterally, upon the inner aspect of the innominate bone, is the obturator internus; whilst, in front, lying against the posterior surface of the triangular ligament, is the compressor urethrcE muscle. But, in addition, there is a strong aponeu- rotic membrane, called the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, which forms a complete lining for the pelvis, and is placed upon the deep surface of these muscles. The pelvic wall may therefore be regarded as con- sisting of three strata, each composed of parts which lie in the same morphological plane, viz. :â€” (i.) A bony, ligamentous, and membranous stratum.* (2.) A muscular stratum. (3.) An aponeurotic stratum. Inferiorly, the pelvic cavity is closed and marked off from the perineum by the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which passes inwards to the viscera from the parietal layer of the same aponeurosis, and also by the pelvic diaphragm, which is placed upon the under surface of the fascia. As we have already seen, this diaphragm consists of the two levatores ani muscles and the two coccygei muscles. Superiorly, the pelvic and abdominal cavities are directly con- tinuous. TJte contents of the pelvic cavity differ in the two * There are animals in which the sciatic ligaments are bony; and the author has seen a female pelvis in the dissecting rooms with the same ligaments in similar condition.

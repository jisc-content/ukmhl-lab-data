32 ABDOMEN. penis it supplies one or two twigs to the corpus cavernosum. The dissection of the perineum is now completed, but whilst the body is in the lithotomy position and the various parts of the perineum exposed, the student should consider what structures still cover the perineal aspect of the prostate gland. Three layers would still require to be removed to bring the prostate into view—viz. (i.) the compressor urethrae muscle ; (2.) the parietal pelvic fascia or the posterior layer of the triangular ligament; (3.) the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle. Such being the case, you will observe that within the limits of the urethral triangle, and dissecting from the surface towards the prostate gland, we meet with an alternation of mtis- adar and fascial strata, viz.:— (i.) Superficial fascia. (2.) Superficial perineal muscles. (3.) Triangular ligament. (4.) Compressor urethra muscle. (5.) Parietal pelvic fascia or posterior layer of trian- gular ligament. (6.) Levator ani muscle. (7-) Capsule of prostate and pubo-prostatic ligament. Further, you should note that the fasciae of the urethral triangle are so arranged that they form a superficial and a deep compartment, and that within one or other of these all the structures of this division of the perineum are contained (Fig. 5, p. 31). The superficial compartment is bounded in front hy

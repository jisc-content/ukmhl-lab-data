ABDOMEN. 244 it does so it pushes itself through the rectal layer, carrying downwards upon its walls a thin tubular prolongation of the fascia (Fig. 45). The arrangement of the visceral pelvic fascia in front of the pelvis must next be studied. The student has already noted that here the visceral layer has a direct attachment to the posterior aspect of the body of the pubic bone close to the lower end of the symphysis, and above the bony origin of the anterior fibres of the levator ani, and the attachment of the Obturator vessels 1 and nerve J â€¢Obturator internus Levator ani Pudic vessels and \ nerves j Prostate Kectum. Fig. 44. parietal pelvic fascia. Draw the bladder backwards and look down between it and the pubic bones. The vesical/aj^er will be seen to pass backwards on each side of the symphysis, in the form of a strong, rounded, and cord-like band, which proceeds over the prostate to the anterior aspect of the bladder. These cord-like bands are the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, or if they are looked at merely in their relations to the pubes and the prostate they are called the pubo- prostatic ligaments. In the middle line there is a

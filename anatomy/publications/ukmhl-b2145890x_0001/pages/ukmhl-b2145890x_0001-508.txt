282 ABDOMEN. the dorsum of the penis between the two corpora cavernosa and through the glans. This cut must be made as far as possible in the mesial plane. Prostatic Portion of the Urethra.—This part of the urethra is about one and a quarter inches in length. It traverses the prostate in front of its middle lobe, and is therefore nearer the anterior than the posterior surface of this structure. It is the widest and at the same time the most dilatable part of the canal, and further, it is fusiform, being wider in the middle than at either its commencement or ter- mination. In connection with the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, there are certain very important features to be noted. The mucous membrane along the mesial plane is raised into a prominent ridge called the verumontanum* This commences a short distance in front of the uvula vesicae, and extends forwards for about three quarters of an inch. Pos- teriorly, it rises to a considerable height, but anteriorly, it gradually fades away. On each side of the veru- montanum, the floor of the urethra is hollowed out into a longitudinal depression, termed the prostatic sinus, into which numerous prostatic ducts open. This may be rendered evident by squeezing the prostate, when fluid will be observed to exude into the sinus. * Other terms are applied to this mesial ridge on the floor of the urethra—viz., crest of the urethra, colliculus seminales, and caput gallinaginis.

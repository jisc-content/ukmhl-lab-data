224 ABDOMEN. The Last Dorsal Nerve will be found running outwards in front of the quadratus lumborum, along the lower border of the last rib. Near the spine it sends a small offset downwards to the first lumbar nerve, and at the outer border of the quadratus lumborum it pierces the aponeurosis of the transvers- alis abdominis, and then passes forwards between this muscle and the internal oblique. Its course and distribution in the wall of the abdomen have already been described (pp. 58, 76). Lumbar Arteries.—These have been traced to the inner border of the psoas. They are now observed to pass backwards behind this muscle to the intervals between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrse. Here each ends by dividing into a dorsal and an abdominal branch. The dorsal branch runs backwards between the transverse processes, and after giving a spinal branch, which enters the spinal canal through the interverte- bral foramen, ends in the muscles and integument of the back. The abdominal branches proceed outwards behind the quadratus lumborum, and are then directed for- wards between the abdominal muscles, where they anastomose, above with the intercostal arteries, below with the deep circumflex iliac and ilio-lumbar arteries, and in front with the superior and deep epigastric arteries. Dissection.—The lower limbs having, by this time, been removed from the trunk, the pelvis may also be i

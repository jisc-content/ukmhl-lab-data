LOWER LIMB. the femur with the handle of the knife. The posterior ligament should also be thoroughly exposed. With regard to the popliteus, it is better not to interfere with the fascia covering its popliteal surface, as this must be examined on a future occasion in connection with the tendon of insertion of the semimembranosus muscle, of which it is an expansion. The dissection of the back of the thigh must be completed on the fourth day. The structures met with after the skin has been thrown back are:— (i.) Superficial fascia. (2.) Cutaneous nerves. (3.) Deep fascia. Reflection of Skin.—A vertical incision must be made in the middle line of the thigh through the belt of skin which still encircles the thigh posteriorly. The two flaps can then be reflected, the one outwards and the other inwards. (PI. I.) Superficial Fascia—Cutaneous Nerves.—In the fatty superficial fascia thus brought into view cutaneous twigs from three sources must be looked for—(i.) Along the middle line of the limb a few minute branches of BACK OP THE THIGH. (4,) Muscles. Biceps. Semitendinosus. Semimembranosus. (5.) Nerves.

Then carry the knife through the intervertebral disc which intervenes be- tween the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, and, having cut the nerves and soft parts, complete the separation of the pelvis from the remainder of the trunk by means of the saw. PELVIS. 1/ The pelvis is the basin-shaped lower part of the abdominal cavity. It has already been defined as be- ing that portion of the general cavity of the abdomen which lies below the level of the ilio-pectineal lines of the innominate bones. Its walls are, for the most part, rigid and composed of bone; behind, it is bounded by the sacrum and coccyx; whilst, in front and laterally, it is bounded by the two ossa innominata. The bony wall, however, is deficient at certain points; thus posteriorly, there is an interval on each side, between the sacrum and the os innominatum, which is partially filled up by the sacro-sciatic ligaments; again, later- ally, there is the wide thyroid foramen, which is closed by the thyroid membrane; and, in front, there is the gap left by the pubic arch, which is occupied by the triangular ligament of the urethra.* Upon the inner aspect of these boundaries of the -Let it be clearly understood that it is the so-called "anterior layer " layer.'"

It emerges from the lower end of the sacral canal, and makes its appearance in the pelvis by piercing the sacro-sciatic ligament and the coccygeus muscle. It is now joined by the fifth sacral nerve and runs downwards. Near the tip of the coccyx it is directed backwards through the coccygeus muscle, and ends in the skin in this neighbourhood. Pelvic Plexus of Sympatheticâ€”The dissector should in the next place make out the distribution of the sympathetic nerves within the pelvis. These have, no doubt, been considerably injured in pre- vious dissections, but those which remain must be carefully traced. The hypogastric plexus has been observed to end inferiorly by dividing into two lateral portions, which are prolonged down- wards, one upon each side of the rectum. These are termed the pelvic plexuses, and each consists of a dense mesh-work of sympathetic nerves. In addition to the branches from the hypogastric plexus, they receive numerous twigs from the sacral spinal nerves, more especially from the third and fourth, and the points at which these unite with the sympathetic filaments are marked by minute ganglia. The pelvic plexuses also acquire branches from the sacral portion of the sympathetic cord. Prolongations from the pelvic plexus upon each

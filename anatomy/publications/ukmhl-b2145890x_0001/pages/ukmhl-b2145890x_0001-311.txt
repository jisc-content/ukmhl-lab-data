87 ABDOMINAL WALL. Poupart's ligament and to the iliac crest can be very clearly shown. Inguinal Canal.â€”The dissector has observed that the spermatic cord in the male and the round liga- ment in the female pierces the abdominal wall above Poupart's ligament. The passage which is formed for its transmission receives the name of the inguinal canal. Now, as this canal is a source of weakness to the abdominal wall, and as it is in connection with it that inguinal hernia occurs, the student will under- stand how necessary it is that he should examine it carefully from all points of view. The inguinal canal is a narrow groove or channel of about two inches in length. It begins at the internal abdominal ring, which may be spoken of as its inlet, and ends at the external abdominal ring, which con- stitutes its outlet, and, consequently, it is very oblique, having a direction almost directly inwards, with a slight inclination downwards and forwards. So much for its length and direction ; we have still to make out in connection with it (i.) a floor; (2.) an anterior wall; and (3.) a posterior wall. The floor is formed in the first part of the canal by the upper grooved surface of Poupart's ligament. To- wards the outlet, however, the floor becomes broader and more definite ; here it is formed not only by Pou- part's ligament, but also by Gimbernat's ligament. At this point, as the student has already observed, the cord rests directly upon the abdominal surface of the latter ligament. The parts which enter into the

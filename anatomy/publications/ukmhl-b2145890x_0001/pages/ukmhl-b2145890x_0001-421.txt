THE DIAPHRAGM. upon the psoas muscle, and, crossing the common or external iliac artery, it enters the pelvis, where it will be afterwards followed. In the abdomen proper it is placed immediately behind the peritoneum, and is crossed obliquely by the spermatic vessels. Before entering the pelvis it passes behind the ileum on the right side and the sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left side. The Suprarenal Capsules are two small flattened triangular bodies, each of which is placed upon the upper end of the kidney. They surmount the kidney after the fashion of a helmet, and are prolonged down- wards for a short distance upon its anterior surface. The suprarenal body rests upon the upper part of the pillar of the diaphragm. On the right side its anterior face is in relation to the under surface of the liver, and on the left side to the pancreas and spleen. The student has already observed its abundant nerve supply from the solar plexus. Its blood supply is equally rich. No fewer than three arteries enter its substance — viz., the superior^ middle^ and inferior capsular arteries. The Diaphragm.—Having now disposed of all the viscera within the cavity of the abdomen proper, the student should in the next place direct his atten- tion to the diaphragm—the great muscle which con- stitutes a moveable partition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Stripping the peritoneum from its lower concave surface, clean the muscular fibres and the central tendinous expansion towards which

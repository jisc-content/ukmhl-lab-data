239 PELVIC FASCIA. body of the pubis gradually sinks, and in front, it is found as low as the inferior border of the symphysis. There is thus a considerable part of the inner surface of the pelvis below the level of the ilio-pectineal line, and the crest of the pubis devoid of fascial lining. Here no continuity can be shown to exist between the iliac and pelvic fasciae, except through the medium of the periosteum. From the line of attachment thus indicated the parietal pelvic fascia descends upon the inner or deep surface of the obturator internus muscle, and is attached inferiorly to the tuberosity of the ischium and to the great and small sciatic ligaments. Traced forwards, it will be found to be fixed to the rami of the pubis and ischium in front of the obturator internus. In this manner, therefore, it may be said to have an attach- ment to the pelvic outlet from the symphysis to the sacrum. When followed backwards, the fascia will be noticed to pass over and close the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and then to turn inwards at an angle to reach the anterior aspect of the sacrum. We have previously seen that the parietal pelvic fascia gives off from its inner surface a layer called the visceral layer, which proceeds inwards towards the viscera, and acts as a partition between the pelvis and the perineum. The line along which this takes origin ' extends around the pelvic wall, from the spine of the' ischium behind to a point in front, a little above the, level of the lowfer end of the symphysis. Along this ' line the fascia is denser and more opaque, and con-) sequently it receives the name of the white line. It can

J 220 ABDOMEN. The ilio-hypogastric nerve emerges from the outer border of the psoas, and crosses the quadratus lum- borum obliquely. Reaching the crest of the ilium, it leaves the abdomen by piercing the transversalis muscle. Its further course has already been studied (p. 76). It is distributed by an iliac branch to the skin of the gluteal region, and by a hypogastric branch to the skin over the lower part of the abdominal wall. The ilio-ingiiinal nerve is smaller than the ilio- hypogastric, and leaves the psoas almost at the same point. It runs obliquely downwards and outwards over the quadratus lumborum and the upper part of the iliacus, and disappears from view by piercing the transversalis muscle a little way in front of the ilio- hypogastric. It is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and the inner aspect of the thigh (p. 76). The genito-crural nerve is directed forwards through the psoas, and appearing upon its anterior aspect, ends by dividing into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch proceeds downwards and inwards, and crossing the external iliac artery, reaches the internal abdominal ring. Here it joins the other constituents of the spermatic cord, and leaving the abdomen, is distributed to. the cremaster muscle. In the female it ends in the round ligament of the uterus and the labium pudendi. The crural branch runs downwards along the outer side of the external iliac artery, and crossing the deep circumflex iliac artery, passes behind Poupart's ligament. It supplies a limited portion of the integument in front of the thigh.

Il8 ABDOMEN. intestine will be seen, and also, in all probability, those parts of the great intestine which occupy the right and left iliac fossae. That part lying in the right iliac fossa is called t\i^-c(^cum, whilst the part situated in the left fossa is the sigmoid flexure. It may also chance that the bladder is full, in which case its apex will be observed projecting above the pubes. Lastly, in pregnant females the gravid uterus will be visible, reaching a height in correspondence with the period of gestation. Raise the great omentum and turn it upwards over the lower margin of the thorax. By this proceeding the coils of the small intestine are fully exposed, and a part of the great intestine which extends across the cavity of the abdomen will be seen shining through the posterior layer of the great omentum. This is the transverse colon. The position and connections of the various viscera should now be studied. The Liver.â€”The liver is the largest gland in the body. It is a solid massive organ, the chief bulk of which lies in the right hypochondrium ; it also extends into the epigastric region, and even enters for a con- siderable distance into the left hypochondrium. Its upper surface is smooth and convex, and is accurately fitted to the under surface of the diaphragm. Attached to this surface is the falciform ligament, which maps out the organ into a right and left lobe. Pass the hand backwards over the upper surface and you wil notice that its posterior rounded border is in contact

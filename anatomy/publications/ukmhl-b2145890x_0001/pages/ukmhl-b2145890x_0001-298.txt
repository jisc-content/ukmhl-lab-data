74 ABDOMEN. crest, and is then directed upwards upon its surface. Although this vessel has not attained the dignity of a name, it is a very constant branch. On the right side the fibres springing from Poupart's ligament should also be severed, but on the left side carry the knife hori- zontally inwards, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the outer margin of the rectus. Now turn your attention to the upper part of the muscle, and make an incision through it along the lower margin of the thorax, from the outer border of the rectus to the last rib. Lastly, carry the knife down- wards, from the tip of the last rib to the crest of the ilium. The muscle freed in this manner can be thrown forwards towards the outer border of the rectus. In doing this the dissector must proceed with caution, because he has reached the plane of the main trunks of the nerves of the abdominal wall and the arteries which accompany them. These pass forwards be- tween the internal oblique and transversalis, and, in. raising the former muscle, they are apt to adhere to its deep surface and be cut. In all probability the student will experience consi- derable difficulty in separating the lower part of the internal oblique from the corresponding portion of the transversalis. At this level these two muscles are always closely connected, and in some cases they may be even found to be partially blended. The cremaster muscle should also be reflected from the spermatic cord. This can best be done by making a longitudinal incision along it. Entering the deep

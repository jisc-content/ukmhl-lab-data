32 UPPER LIMB. bounds it on the outer side, the pronator teres on the inner side, and the base is formed by a Hne drawn between the condyles of the humerus ; the brachial artery and its two terminal branches, the median nerve, and the tendon of the biceps are the contents ; the brachialis anticus and the supinator brevis constitute the floor. When the bounding muscles are separated widely from each other, other structures come into view, but they cannot be regarded as lying within the space proper. They are—(i.) The musculo-spiral nerve, and the superior profunda and radial recurrent arteries lying deeply between the supinator longus and the brachialis anticus ; (2.) The anterior ulnar recurrent and some branches of the anastomotica magna, placed under cover of the pronator radii teres. BACK OP UPPER ARM. This dissection includes :— (1.) The triceps muscle. (2.) Superior profunda artery and the musculo-spiral nerve. (3.) The inferior profunda artery and ulnar nerve. (4.) Posterior branches of the anastomotic artery. (5.) Subanconeus muscle. (6.) Anconeus muscle. Reflection of Skin.—No additional incision is necessary. Remove the skin from the entire upper arm and for three inches below the elbow-joint. As the integument is being raised from the olecranon, a synovial bursa will be found intervening between the bone and the deep fascia.

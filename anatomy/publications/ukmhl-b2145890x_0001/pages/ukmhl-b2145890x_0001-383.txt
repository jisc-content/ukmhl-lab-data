INTESTINAL CANAL. by holding the bowel up to the light they can generally be detected. In our examination of Peyer's patches it is better to begin at the lower end of the ileum and pass upwards. A Peyer's patch consists of a large number of lymphoid follicles grouped together so as to present to the eye a patch of an elongated, oblong figure. The long axis of the patches corresponds in its direc- tion with that of the gut itself, and they are always placed upon that aspect of the wall of the gut which is opposite the line of the mesenteric attachment. This is the reason why the student was directed to open the bowel along this line. In the lower part of the ileum the patches may present a length of two or even four inches, and a breadth of about half-an-inch, but as we follow them up the tube into the jejunum they become much smaller and not nearly so numerous. The total number varies much, but the average number may be stated to be about thirty. The solitary glands are isolated lymphoid follicles, scattered everywhere over the mucous membrane of the small intestine. They are minute, rounded or ovoid, opaque white bodies, about the size of a millet seed, and they usually cause a slight bulging of the mucous membrane at the points where they occur. The valvulcB conniventes, the villi, and Peyei^s patches are the only special peculiarities of the mucous mem- brane of the jejunum and ileum which are visible to the naked eye, and from what has been said regarding them the dissector will understand that although they

2 UPPER LIMB. In certain of these structures the dissectors of the arm and head and neck have a joint interest. This dissection must be completed in two days, in order that the dissector of the head and neck m2.y continue the deeper dissection of the back. The first day's work should consist (^.) in the reflec- tion of the skin, in the dissection of the cutaneous nerves and vessels, and (^.) in cleaning the latissimus dorsi and trapezius muscles. The remainder of the dissection can quite well. be undertaken upon the second day. Reflection of Skin.—Incisio7is.—{i) From the tip of the coccyx upwards along the middle line of the body to the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra. (2.) From the upper end of this mesial incision trans- versely outwards to the inner border of the acromion process of the scapula. (3.) From the lower extremity of the mesial incision in a curved directio*n outwards along the crest of the ilium to within two or three inches of anterior superior iliac spine. (4.) An oblique incision from the spine of the first lumbar vertebra to the outer border of the acromion process (PI. I. and PI. III. p. 2). By these incisions two large flaps of skin are mapped out upon the back. Reflect the upper triangular flap first, and then deal in the same way with the lower lumbar flap. Cutaneous Vessels and Nerves.—Having studied the characters of the fatty superficial fascia, which lies subjacent to the skin, proceed with the dissection of

ANTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 111 (2.) Recurrent tibial (3.) External malleolar. (4.) Internal malleolar. The recurrent tibial comes off as soon as the parent trunk reaches the front of the leg. It passes upwards through the fibres of the tibialis anticus to reach the anterior aspect of the knee-joint. The malleolar are given off close to the ankle-joint. The ^;ir/m2^/passes outwards under cover of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, whilst the internal runs inwards under cover of the tendons of the extensor longus hallucis and tibialis anticus. Anterior Tibial Nerve.â€”This nerve, a branch of the external popliteal nerve, has already been seen in relation to the anterior tibial artery. Its various branches to the muscles on the front of the leg should be cleaned. It gives branches (i.) to the tibialis anticus, (2.) to the extensor longus hallucis, (3.) to the extensor longus digitorum, and (4.) to the peroneus tertius. You will notice that it reaches the anterior tibial artery by emerging from amongst the fibres of the extensor longus digitorum, in the upper part of the leg; further, that it leaves the leg by passing along with the artery under cover of the anterior annular ligament Anterior Peroneal Artery.~In a successfully injected subject this vessel will be exposed, as it runs downwards upon the lower part of the fibula, by drawing aside the peroneus tertius muscle. A little dissection will show that it reaches the front of the leg

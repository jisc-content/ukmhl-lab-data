2^ UPPER LIMB. towards the interval between the olecranon and internal condyle. They lie upon the dorsal aspect of the internal intermuscular septum, and have a thm covering of the fibres of the internal head of triceps. To find the small suhanconeus muscle the triceps must be divided transversely a short distance above the elbow-joint, and in making the dissection a communicating branch which passes across the back of the humerus from the anastomotica magna to the superior profunda artery will be discovered. The bursa between the tendon of the triceps and the olecranon must not be overlooked. Anconeus Muscle.-This muscle, although it is situated in the forearm, should be studied at this stage. It is simply a part of the triceps muscle-a continuation downwards of it. The nei-ve to this muscle from the musculo-spiral has already been noted. FORBABM. The skin should be removed from the forearm both on its anterior and posterior aspects. It is well also to remove the integument from the dorsum of the hand at the same time. The skin should be kept so that it may be restored to its position after each day s dissection. Reflection of Incisions.â€”ii^) A vertical incision along the middle line of the forearm on its anterior aspect to a point about one inch below the radio-carpal joint. (2.) A transverse incision at right angles to the lower end of the mesial cut from the

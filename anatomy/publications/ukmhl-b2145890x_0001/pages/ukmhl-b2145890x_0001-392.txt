166 ABDOMEN. and ends near the spleen by dividing into five or six branches, which enter the organ on its concave surface. To obtain a good view of the splenic artery, it is necessary to throw the stomach upwards towards the ribs. The vessel will then be seen to run along the upper border of the pancreas, which somewhat over- laps it. It is accompanied by the splenic vein, which, however, lies at a lower level, and therefore altogether behind the pancreas. The following are the branches of the splenic artery:â€” f Pancreaticse parvae. (I.) Pancreatic. | p^^^^^^.^,^ ^^g^a. . / Vasa brevia. (2.) Gastric. | ^^^^ gastro-epiploic. (3.) Splenic. The artericE pancreaticcB parvce are small twigs which come off at various points for the supply of the pan- creas. The pancreatica magna is a larger branch which arises from the splenic artery near its termina- tion. It sinks into the pancreas, and is directed from left to right in the gland substance in company with the duct. The vasa brevia are five or six small arteries, of which some arise directly from the splenic, whilst others take origin from its terminal branches. They run towards the stomach between the two layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, and are distributed to the cardiac end of this viscus, anastomosing with the coronary and left gastro-epiploic arteries. _ The left gastro-epiploic takes origin from the splenic i 1

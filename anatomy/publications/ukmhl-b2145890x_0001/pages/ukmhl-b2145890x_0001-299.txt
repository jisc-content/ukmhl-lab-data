ABDOMINAL WALL. 75 surface of the cremaster is a small branch of the deep epigastric artery and the genital branch of the genito- crural nerve. These constitute its vascular and nerv- ous supply, and must, if possible, be secured. Now- clean the transversalis muscle, and dissect out the vessels and nerves which lie upon it.

The six lower intercostal nerves issue from the anterior ends of the six lower intercostal spaces, and then pro- ceed forwards, between the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles, to the outer border of the rectus. Here they disappear by piercing and passing within the sheath of this muscle. In a future dissection they will be observed sinking into the substance of the rectus, supplying it with twigs, and then turning for- wards to pierce the sheath a second time. They end on the front of the abdomen as the anterior cutaneous nerves. Midway between the spine and the linea alba they give off the lateral cutaneous nerves. They like- wise supply offsets to the transversalis and two oblique muscles. Minute arteries accompany these nerves.

THE MESENTERY PROPER. 149 dense plexus of sympathetic twigs, which surrounds the superior mesenteric artery like a sheath. From it filaments are prolonged to the gut along the various branches of the artery. As the nerves approach the bowel, some of the twigs leave the vessels and effect a series of communications with each other in the inter- vals between the arteries. The superior mesenteric plexus is an offshoot from the solar plexus, and it distributes twigs to the jejunum, ileum, and to the right half of the great intestine. Mesenteric Lymphatic Glands.â€”These are very numerous, indeed considerably over a hundred in num- ber. In health they rarely attain a size greater than that of a bean or a pea, and they are scattered irregularly between the two layers of the mesentery in the intervals between the blood-vessels. It should be noted, how- ever, that they are most numerous opposite the jejunum, and that the mesentery in immediate relation to the gut is free from them. The lacteals on emerging from these glands converge and unite into two or three large vessels, which lie alongside the superior mesenteric artery, and finally end in the receptaculum chyli. A few lymphatic glands will also be noticed in con- nection with the great intestine. Inferior Mesenteric Artery.-The coils of the small intestine must now be pulled over to the right side of the body, and the peritoneum carefully removed by the fingers from the lower part of the aorta and the left side of the spine and psoas muscle. The inferior mesenteric artery is thus exposed, and its branches can

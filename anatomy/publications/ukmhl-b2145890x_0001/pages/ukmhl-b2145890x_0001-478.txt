I 252 ABDOMEN. backwards towards the concavity of the second part of the rectum. It is not in actual contact with the gut, however; above, it is separated from it by the lower part of the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum, and below this by the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia, the vasa deferentia, and the vesiculae seminales. The ureters open into the upper part of the base. The anterior surface^ which looks downwards and slightly forwards, is devoid of peritoneum, and is con- nected to the symphysis, the pubic bones, and the lower part of the anterior abdominal waU by some loose areolar tissue. The posterior surface is directed upwards and slightly backwards, and is covered by peritoneum. Intervening between it and the rectum is the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum and any coils of intestine that this may chance to contain. Upon the lateral surface the obliterated hypogastric artery and the vas deferens will be found. As the latter descends towards the base, it will be noticed to cross to the inner side of the obliterated hypogastric artery. This aspect of the bladder is clothed by peritoneum as far forwards as the obliterated hypogastric artery ; along the line of this fibrous cord it quits the viscus and passes to the iliac fossa and the lateral wall of the pelvis. The 7ieck or cervix of the bladder is that part from which the urethra issues. It is surrounded by the base of the prostate, and is directed downwards. The Ureters.â€”After entering the pelvis, the ureter of each side proceeds towards the base of the bladder

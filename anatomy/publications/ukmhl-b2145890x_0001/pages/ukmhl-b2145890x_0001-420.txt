194 ABDOMEN. the hilus it expands into a wide funnel-shaped portion called the pelvis. This enters the sinus and breaks up into two, or perhaps three, large primary branches, and these again break up into a large number of short stunted secondary divisions called calices or infun- dibula, which are attached to the walls of the sinus. An examination of the cut surface of the kidney will show that its substance is arranged in two parts —a medullary and a cortical. The medullary portio7i is situated next the sinus, and is seen to consist of pyramidal masses, the bases of which are directed towards the periphery, whilst their apices are free and project into the sinus. On the sinus wall each appears in the form of a prominent mamillary process, called a papilla, which projects into one of the calices of the pelvis of the ureter. If the kidney be squeezed, fluid will be seen to exude from these papillae, showing that the tubuli uriniferi open upon their surface. The cortical substance, which constitutes the peripheral part of the gland, is about two lines in depth, and it will be observed to send prolongations inwards between the pyramids. These are called the columns of Bertin. The Ureter.—This is the duct which carries the urine from the kidney to the bladder. The relations of its expanded upper end or pelvis at the hilus of the kidney have already been noted. Leaving the gland, it turns downwards and becomes contracted, so that when it reaches the level of the lower end of the organ it has acquired the appearance of a cylindrical tube. The ureter extends downwards and inwards

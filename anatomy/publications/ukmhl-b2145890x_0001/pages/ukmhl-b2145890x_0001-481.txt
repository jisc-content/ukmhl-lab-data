PELVIC VISCERA. receptacles for the semen, which intervene between the base of the bladder and the second part of the rectum. Conical or somewhat pyriform in shape, each seminal vesicle presents a narrow anterior end in close proximity to the base of the prostate, and an expanded or blunt posterior end in relation to the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum. In front, they are near to each other and the mesial plane, but they diverge widely as they proceed backwards, so that posteriorly they are separated by a considerable interval. The vas deferens lies along the inner side of each. In length, the vesicle measures about two inches. By introducing a blow-pipe into the narrow anterior extremity and inflating it with air a demon- stration of its capacity may be obtained. Each vesicula seminalis is in reality a closed tube, five or six inches long, coiled upon itself and held in its present form by dense areolar tissue. When unravelled, several diverticula will be observed to proceed from the main tube. The narrow anterior end of the vesicle joins the vas deferens at an acute angle to form the common ejaculatory duct. Vas Deferens.â€”The vas deferens, or duct of the testicle, has already been traced to the internal abdo- minal ring, through which it enters the abdomen. Separating itself from the other factors of the sper- matic cord, it now hooks round the deep epigastric artery, and descends upon the inner side of the external iliac artery into the pelvis. Here it is con- tinued downwards upon the lateral surface of the

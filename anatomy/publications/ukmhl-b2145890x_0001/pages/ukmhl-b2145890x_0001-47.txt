35 FOREARM. radial to the ulnar margins of the wrist; this incision should be carried well round the wrist so as to end on the dorsal aspect of the hand. (3.) Lastly, an incision from each extremity of the latter along the radial and ulnar margins of the hand. Superficial Veins. — The four superficial veins which we have previously seen entering into the formation of the cephalic and basilic veins must be followed down the forearm to their various points of origin. Begin with the median vem. This will lead us as far down as the root of the thumb. The anterior ulnar may be followed to the wrist, and the posterior ulnar to the dorsum of the hand, where it is formed by the junction of a small vein from the back of the little finger, and another from the dorsal venous arch of the hand. The radial vein on the outer side of the forearm springs from the outer end of this arch. Cutaneous Nerves.—Upon the outer aspect of the ' forearm, the student must trace out the following cutaneous nerves :—(i.) Cutaneous part of the musculo- cutaneous, which spreads out chiefly upon the anterior aspect of the limb. (2.) External cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral, which is mainly distributed to the skin posteriorly. (3.) The radial nerve. This nerve is found in the lower third of the radial margin of the forearm, as it emerges from under cover of the tendon of the supinator longus. It gives a few twigs to the back of the forearm, but its chief distribution is upon the dorsum of the hand, where it divides into the dorsal collateral branches for the thumb, index,

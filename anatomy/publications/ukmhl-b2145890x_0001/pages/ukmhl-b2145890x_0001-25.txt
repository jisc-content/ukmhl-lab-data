13 PECTORAL REGION. intercostal spaces) in the meantime. They are best dissected along with the other contents of the axillary space. The Descendijig Nerves come from the cervical plexus, and are found passing downwards over the clavicle. Whilst searching for these the dissector cannot fail to obsei-ve the sparse fibres of the platysma myoides arising from the pectoral fascia. Mammary Gland.—Examine next the mammary gland, and make out its precise extent and connections by removing the fatty superficial fascia around it.. Carefully reflect the skin, which has been left, towards the summit of the nipple, and inserting bristles through the minute external orifices, try to make out the milk ducts and their ampullae or sacculations. Pectoralis Major.—This muscle must now be cleaned and its division into sternal and clavicular parts clearly made out. The muscular fibres are rendered tense by abducting the arm from the side. On the right side of the body the dissector begins at the lower margin of the muscle, whilst on the left side he commences at the upper border. Clean also the anterior margin of the deltoid. In the cellular interval between it and the clavicular pectoralis major the cephalic vein and the humeral-thoracic artery will be discovered. Axillary Fascia.—In removing the deep fascia from the surface of the pectoralis major notice how it is continuous around the lower margin of the muscle with the axillary fascia. Continue the dissection so as

158 THORAX. Several twigs from the sympathetic enter this plexus. From both anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses nerves are prolonged into the interior of the lung. The bronchial arteries are the proper nutrient vessels of the lung. They convey the blood which supplies the lung-substance ; and they are usually placed upon the posterior aspect of the bronchus. The pulmonary vessels and the bronchus should now be separated from each other with the handle of the knife, and their relative positions in the root of the lung studied. The veins are placed most anteriorly and the bronchus most posteriorly, whilst the artery is inter- mediate in position. When examined in respect to their relations from above downwards, the two sides of the body differ from each other. On both sides the veins occupy the lozvest level. On the right side the bronchus is highest and the artery intermediate, whereas on the left side the artery is highest and the bronchus intermediate in position. The left bronchus descends lower in the chest than the right bronchus, and thus comes to lie intermediate between the pul- monary veins and the pulmonary artery. These relations may be shortly expressed thus :â€” From before backwards. ( Veins. Both sides \ Artery. V Bronchus. C Artery. Left sideX Bronchus. I Veins. Fro7n above downwards. ( Bronchus.

UPPER LIMB. 12 anterior fold of the axilla to the point at which this joins the upper arm. This last incision may with advantage be carried vertically down the arm for two and a-half ■or three inches (PI. II. and PL IV. p. 9). Two triangular flaps of skin are marked out by these incisions, and these are now to be raised from the fatty superficial fascia. If the subject be a female it is well to encircle the areola and nipple with the knife and leave the skin covering them undisturbed. Cutaneous Vessels and Nerves.—There are three distinct groups of cutaneous nerves, and each group has its own area of distribution. They are :— (r.) The Anterior Cutaneous. (2.) The Lateral Cutaneous. (3.) The Descending Cutaneous. TJie Anterior Cutaneous Nerves are minute terminal twigs of the intercostal nerves, and they become super- ficial close to the margin of the sternum. One is found in each intercostal space, and they are accom- panied by the perfoi^ating b7'anches of the internal mammary artery. The Latei^al Cutaneous Nerves are the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves. They are found upon the side of the chest between the digita- tions of the serratus magnus. Trace the anterior and posterior branches of these, forwards over the lower margin of the pectoralis major and backwards over the anterior margin of the latissimus dorsi. Do not attempt to secure the two highest lateral cutaneous nerves {i.e., those issuing from the second and third

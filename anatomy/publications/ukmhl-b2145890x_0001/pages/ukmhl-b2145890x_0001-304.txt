8o ' ABDOMEN. pubes it passes behind the rectus, and blends with the posterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique. Below this point it passes in front of the rectus, and blends with the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and external oblique. Contents of the Sheath of the Rectus.—The sheath of the rectus should now be opened on both sides of the body by a vertical incision along the middle line of the muscle. The divided anterior lamella should then be carefully raised from the surface of the muscle and turned outwards and inwards. At the linese transversa this can only be done with difficulty, so close is the connection between the sheath and the tendinous intersections of the muscle. Within the rectal sheath we find the following parts (i.) The rectus muscle. (2.) The pyramidalis muscle. (3.) The terminal portions of the six lower intercostal nerves, and the last dorsal nerve. (4.) The deep epigastric artery. (5.) The superior epigastric artery. In cleaning the rectus keep in mind the intercostal nerves and the last dorsal nerve. These will now be seen to enter the sheath and sink into the rectus. After supplying it with twigs, they come forward from its substance as the anterior 'cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. Rectus Muscle.—This is a broad band of muscu- lar fibres which stretches between the chest and the pubes, on each side of the linea alba. Inferiorly it

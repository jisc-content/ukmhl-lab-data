FEMALE PERINEUM. 39 The Clitoris is the homologue of the penis, and, notwithstanding its diminutive proportions, it presents a close resemblance to the male organ both in appearance and structure. It is a minute reddish elongated projection placed below the a.nterior com- missure. It is surmounted by a sensitive rounded tubercle called the glans. The manner in which its prepuce and frenum are formed has already been described. To obtain a proper view of the clitoris the student must lay hold of the glans with the forceps and draw it out from the prepuce. The dissector should next take note of a smooth triangular interval which exists between the clitoris and the entrance to the vagina. The term vestibule is given to this area. It is bounded laterally by the nymphae, and towards its lower part or base is seen the orifice of the urethra. The Urethral Orifice lies close to the opening of the vagina about one inch below the clitoris. It is circular in form, and the mucous membrane around it is prominent, pouting and slightly puckered, so that when the tip of the finger is passed over the vestibular area the opening can readily be distinguished by touch. The Vaginal Orifice is elliptical in form. In the virgin it is partially closed by the hymenâ€”a semi- lunar fold of mucous membrane attached to the posterior aspect and sides of the entrance of the vagina and presenting a free concave margin towards the pubes. The form of the hymen, however, is very

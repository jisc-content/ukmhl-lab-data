97 FRONT OF THE THIGH. The vastus exiemus can be partially separated from the crureus, and the line of separation is indicated by the descending branch of the external circumflex artery, and the nerve of supply to the muscle. The suhcnireus muscle is simply a part of the crureus. It consists of a bundle of muscular fibres inserted into the synovial membrane. It is displayed by the dissection which has been made to separate the vastus internus from the crureus. Its nerve of supply has been noted. Adductor Muscles. — The group of adductor muscles on the inner aspect of the thigh, together with the nerves and blood-vessels associated with them, must next be dissected. These muscles are disposed in three strata: the superficial stratum being formed by the adductor longus and the pectineus, which lie in the same plane; the second stratum being represented by the adductor brevis ; and the third or deep stratum by the adductor magnus. The gracilis muscle, also an adductor, extends along the inner aspect of the thigh. Interposed between these muscular layers, and afford- ing a means of separating the one from the other (even in animals where they are more or less fused), are the two divisions of the obturator nerve. The anterior division is placed between the superficial and middle layers, and the posterior division between the middle and deep layers. profunda artery also lies for a part of its course between the superficial and middle strata. Adductor Longus and Profunda Artery.—The adductor longus should be reflected after the dissector H

FEMALE PERINEUM. 43 In cleaning these muscles the dissector should look for the small nervous twigs which are given to each by the perineal division of the internal pudic nerve. The transversus perinei has the same disposition as in the male, but it is rare to find it so well marked in the female. In most subjects its fibres are pale, and it is very difficult to define. It is a slender fasciculus which takes origin from the inner surface of the ramus of the ischium close to the tuberosity, and passes ob- liquely forwards and inwards to its insertion into the central point of the perineum. The erector clitoridis corresponds with the erector penis in the male. It is a small muscle which arises from the inner aspect of the ischial tuberosity, and is inserted into a tendinous expansion on the surface of the crus clitoridis. The sphincter vagince is the representative of the accelerator urinse of the male. It is a true sphincter muscle, and consists of two halves, which are placed one on each side of the vaginal orifice and vestibule, and are closely adapted to the surfaces of the two halves of the vaginal bulb. Posteriorly the fibres of opposite sides unite behind the vaginal opening, and are attached to the central point of the perineum, some of the fibres intermixing with those of the sphincter ani. Anteriorly the two portions of the muscle become narrower, and converging towards the middle line, are attached to the sides of the clitoris. In some cases a small fasciculus on each side may be observed to reach the dorsum of the clitoris, and there gain insertion into a tendinous

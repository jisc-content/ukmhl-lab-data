LOWER LIMB. 128 nerves and vessels will be observed to perforate the deep fascia in order to reach the skin. Towards the heads of the metatarsal bones, the digital vessels and nerves are unprotected by the deep fascia, and here the dissector must proceed cautiously. The nerves and vessels which go to the tibial side of the hallux and to the fibular side of the little toe are especially liable to injury as they perforate the fascia further back than the others. Plantar Fascia.—The plantar fascia which is now brought into view will be noticed to consist of three portions—a central and {b) two lateral parts. This subdivision is indicated by a difference in the density of the three parts and by two shallow furrows which traverse the foot in a longitudinal direction, one upon either side of the strong central portion of fascia. Each of the three portions of fascia is in relation to a subjacent muscle. The ce7itral portion covers the flexor brevis digitorum, the' external lateral part clothes the abductor minimi digiti and the internal lateral part covers the abductor hallucis. The central portion of the plantar fascia stands out in marked contrast to the lateral portions in point of strength and density. Observe how it expands as it passes forwards, and how it splits into five processes, which are bound together by transverse fibres, and between which, the digital vessels and nerves, and the lumbrical muscles appear. Trace these processes forwards. One goes to the root of each toe, and there divides into two slips, which embrace the flexor

LOWER LIMB. 124 As the two last muscles, however, are followed down- wards they will be noticed to undergo a change in their relative positions. The broad tendon of the tibialis posticus inclines inwards under cover of the lower part of the flexor longus digitorum, so that it grooves the internal malleolus to the inner side of the tendon of the flexor. The strong fascia which covers the surface of the tibialis posticus deserves more attention than is usually given to it by the dissector. To see it thoroughly and to demonstrate its attachment to the fibula on the one side and to the tibia on the other, the flexor of the toes must be pushed inwards and some of its fibres of origin divided. The flexor longus hallucis must in like manner be pushed outwards. The fascia will then be seen to serve as a surface of origin to both these muscles ; and on its removal, it will also be observed to give fibres by its deep surface to the subjacent tibialis posticus. Peroneal Artery.â€”This vessel may now be traced downwards as it descends amidst the fibres of the flexor longus hallucis. It gives off muscular twigs, a nutrient vessel to the fibula, and it ends about two inches above the external malleolus by dividing into ' the anterior and posterior arteries. The anterior peroneal perforates the interosseous mem- brane, and it has been seen in the anterior tibio-fibular region. The posterior peroneal continues downwards to the posterior aspect of the external malleolus, and gives twigs to the parts upon the outer aspect of the ankle-

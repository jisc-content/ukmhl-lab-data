INTESTINAL CANAL. . 125 The coils formed by the jejunum and ileum are suspended from the posterior wall of the abdomen by a wide fold of peritoneum, called the mesentery. They are thus freely moveable within the cavity. They lie in the umbilical, hypogastric, and right and left iliac regions, and a few coils of ileum are always found extending downwards into the pelvis. The Large Intestine.—The large intestine, although possessing a much wider calibre than thesmall intestine, is not nearly so long. It extends from the right iliac fossa, where we have seen it to be continuous with the ileum, to the anus, and it rarely measures more than five or six feet in length. Like the small intestine, it is widest at its commencement, and gradually diminishes in diameter as it advances towards its termination. A short way above the anus, however, It again expands. It is subdivided arbitrarily into' the following parts :— The coecum. I Ascending colon. Hepatic flexure. Transverse colon. \ Splenic flexure. / Descending colon. V Sigmoid flexure. The colon. < The rectum. The ccecum is the blind commencement of the large mtestine. , It lies in the right iliac fossa, and is connected with the surface of the fascia iliaca by some loose areolar tissue.

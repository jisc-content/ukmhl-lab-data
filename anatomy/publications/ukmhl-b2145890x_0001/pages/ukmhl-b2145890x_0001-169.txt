THORACIC CAVITY. relation to the upper border of the pulmonary root; (2.) The superior vena cava, in the lower part of its course, lies in front of the pulmonary root. On the left side, the arch of the aorta arches over the root of the lung, and the descending thoracic aorta passes down behind it. Now proceed to dissect out the constituent parts of the root of the lung. The most important structures which enter into its formation areâ€”(i.) two pul- monary veins; (2.) the pulmonary artery; (3.) the bronchus. But, in addition to these, there are also one or two small bronchial arteries and veins, the pulmonary nerves, and the pulmonary lymphatic vessels. These are bound together by some loose areolar tissue, and the whole is invested by pleura. The pulmonary nerves are derived from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses. The anterior pul- monary plexus is composed of two or three exceedingly delicate filaments which come from the pneumogastric nerve. These join with the sympathetic twigs on the .wall of the pulmonary artery. The plexus of the left "side is larger than that of the right side, because it receives a few filaments from the superficial cardiac plexus. The deep cardiac plexus gives twigs to the anterior pulmonary plexus on both sides of the body. It is only under the most favourable circumstances that a good dissection of these nerves can be made. The posterior pulmonary plexus is easily dissected. It represents the entire trunk of the pneumogastric nerve broken up so as to assume a plexiform arrangement upon the posterior aspect of the pulmonary root.

15 AXILLA OR ARMPIT. will be exhibited, and these may also be removed as they come into view. Begin by dissecting out the subscapular artery and the long subscapular nerve as they traverse the posterior wall. The guide to their position is the lower margin of the subscapularis muscle. Lying against the anterior wall, and in relation to the lower margin of pectoralis minor, the long thoracic artery will be found. A vertical incision along the inner wall, a short distance anterior to the point at which this joins the posterior wall, will display the external respiratory nerve, or the nerve of Bell, upon the axillary surface of the serratus magnus. Next by carrying the knife obliquely through the loose tissue, from the inner to the outer wall, the lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal nerve and the intercosto-humeral branch of the second intercostal nerve will be found. These structures being secured, the dissector may proceed with his work more boldly, as the other con-^ tents of the space are not so liable to injury. Trace the branch from the third intercostal nerve and the inter- costo-humeral to their distribution on the inner aspect of the upper arm, and make out the junction between the latter and the nerve of Wrisberg. This will naturally lead the student to examine the important structures which lie in relation to the outer wall of the spaceâ€”viz., the axillary artery and vein and the axillary nerves. In the first place note the close manner in which these cling to the outer wall of the axilla in the various movements of the limb, and then proceed to isolate them and establish their

24 ABDOMEN. pudic artery and dorsal nerve of the penis which pierce the Hgament in its upper part. The triangular ligament is now seen to be a strong aponeurotic membrane which stretches across the pubic arch. It is not, as is frequently stated, continuous with the parietal or obturator layer of the pelvic fascia. It must be regarded as lying in the same morphological plane as the bony and ligamentous wall of the pelvis, and as completing the pelvic wall in front in the same manner as the thyroid membrane fills up the gap formed by the thyroid foramen. The attachments of this ligament are very precise. By its apex it is fixed to the subpubic ligament, and upon each side it is attached to the margins of the rami of the pubis and ischium. Its base is somewhat indefinite, and has already been seen to blend along the lower borders of the transversus perinei muscles with the deep surface of the superficial fascia. In addition to this attachment, however, a careful dissec- tion in a good subject will show that the central part of the base projects backwards and downwards in the form of a short process or peak, which joins the central point of the perineum. Surfaces—\\\ the erect posture of the body the superficial surface of the ligament looks downwards and forwards, whilst its deep surface looks upwards and backwards towards the cavity of the pelvis. In close contact with its anterior surface are the parts which constitute the root of the penis—viz., the bulb and the two crura and the muscles which are associated with them, also the transversus perinei muscles.

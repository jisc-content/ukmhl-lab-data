25 MALE PERINEUM. structures which are in relation to its deep surface will be studied when it is reflected. Apertures.—The triangular ligament is not an unbroken continuous layer of fascia. It is pierced —(i.) by the urethra ; (2.) by the pudic arteries ; (3.) by the dorsal nerves of the penis ; (4.) by the dorsal vein of the penis; (5.) and lastly, at its base, where it blends with the superficial fascia, by the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, as the dissector has already noticed. The aperture for the urethra is situated in the middle line, one inch below the symphysis pubis. It is not a clean cut hole with sharp edges. The margins of the opening are pro- longed over the bulb of the penis so as to form for it an aponeurotic capsule. As soon as the urethra gains the superficial aspect of the ligament, it sinks into the bulb and is carried forwards through the entire length of the corpus spongiosum to its external opening on the glans penis. The aperture for the dorsal vein of the penis is also placed in the middle line, but at a higher level—^viz., midway between the symphysis pubis and the opening for the urethra. The dorsal nerve of the penis and the internal pudic artery pierce the ligament at the same level as the vein, but external to it. The term " anterior layer'' of the triangular ligament is frequently applied to this membrane, which implies that there is a deeper or posterior layer to be studied in connection with it; and so there is. But whilst these layers are very intimately connected, they must be looked upon as being distinct structures. The

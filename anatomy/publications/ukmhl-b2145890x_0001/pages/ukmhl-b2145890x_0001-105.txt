FRONT OF THE THIGH. 93 and ends abruptly in a sharply-defined margin opposite :the opening in the adductor magnus. At this point !look for the long saphenous nerve and the superficial branch of the anastomotic artery. They will be found escaping from the canal by passing under cover of the .lower free border of the expansion. Divide this apon- ceurotic expansion in order that we may bring into view tthe contents of the canal. These are—(i.) The femoral cartery ; (2.) The femoral vein ; and (3.) The long saphe- 1 nous nerve. While the artery lies in Hunter's canal it .gives off the anastoniotica mag?ia. The deep branch .of this artery sinks into the substance of the vastus iinternus, and may be traced through its fibres to tthe knee-joint. The superficial branch, with the Hong saphenous nerve, escapes at the lower end of the (canal, and becomes superficial at the inner side of the Iknee. The various muscular branches of the femoral ; artery must also be preserved. Tensor Fasciae Femoris and Ilio-tibial Band i of Fascia Lata.—The tensor fasciae femoris will be :seen in the upper and outer part of the thigh. The li dissector should carefully study its peculiar relation to ■the fascia lata. Separating the ilio-tibial hd^nd of the fascia lata from the outer surface of the vastus externus, to which it is connected by some loose areolar tissue, and tracing it upwards, it will be observed to split into two layers—a superficial and a deep—so as to enclose the muscle. Both layers are exceedingly strong, and the tensor fasciae femoris is inserted into the angle of splitting. The superficial lamina is 1

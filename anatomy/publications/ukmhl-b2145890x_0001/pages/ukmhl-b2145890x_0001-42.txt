20 UPPER LIMB. arises close to the lower border of the teres major muscle, and accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve. The inferior profunda comes off a little lower down and following the course of the ulnar nerve, it sinks through the internal intermuscular septum. The mitrient artery seldom springs directly from the brachial. It is more usual for it to arise from the inferior profunda. The anastomotica magna will be found passing inwards over the brachialis anticus, immediately above the elbow. Some of its branches proceed down in front of the internal condyle, whilst others pass backwards through the internal inter- muscular septum. Muscles and Musculo-cutaneous Nerve.-The tnuscles in relation to the brachial artery-viz., the biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis anticus- should now be carefully cleaned and their attach- ments made out, and in connection with them the musculo-cutaneous nerve may be followed down- wards As it pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle it supplies it with twigs, and as it lies between the biceps and brachialis anticus it gives branches to both. Lastly, separate the supinator longus muscle from the brachialis anticus, and dissect out the musculo- spiral nerve and the superior profunda artery, which lie deeply between them. Here also the anastomosis between the superior profunda and the radial recurrent arteries may be made out in a well-injected subject, and the twigs from the musculo-spiral to the brachialis

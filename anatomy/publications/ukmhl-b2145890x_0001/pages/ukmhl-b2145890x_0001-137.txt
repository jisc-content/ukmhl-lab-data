POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 12$ joint. A short distance above the joint it receives the communicatmg branch from the posterior tibial artery. Internal Annular Ligament.—The connections of this thickened band of deep fascia should be care- fully studied, and also the arrangement of the structures which pass under cover of it into the sole of the foot. It bridges across the hollow between the prominence of the OS calcis and the internal malleolus, and it is attached to both. Above it is chiefly connected with that layer of the deep fascia which intervenes between the superficial and deep muscles on the back of the leg, but it is also continuous with the general apon- eurotic investment of the leg. Inferiorly its lower margin gives origin to the abductor hallucis, and is connected with the inner portion of the plantar fascia. Passing under cover of this ligament the dissector will observe—posterior tibial vessels and nerve ; {b) to the outer side of these the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis ; (<:.) to their inner side the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus. From within outwards these structures lie in the following order:— (i.) Tendon of tibialis posticus. (2.) Tendon of flexor longus digitorum. (3.) Posterior tibial vessels. (4.) Posterior tibial nerve. (5.) Tendon of flexor longus hallucis. The tendons are isolated from each other and from the vessels and nerve by septa which pass from the deep surface of the ligament to ridges on the bones.

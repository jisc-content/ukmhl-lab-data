THORACIC WALL. carried inwards, first upon the pleura, and then upon the triangularis sterni muscle. Lastly, they cross the internal mammary artery and come forwards at the side of the sternum as the anterior cutaneous nerves of the pectoral region. Before it reaches the surface each nerve pierces («.) the internal intercostal muscle, (<5.) the anterior intercostal membrane, (^r.) the origin of the pectoralis major, and (^.) the deep fascia. The intercostal nerves give twigs to the intercostal muscles, and also to the triangularis sterni. The lower six nerves on leaving the intercostal spaces pass forwards between the abdominal muscles. It is not necessary to make a dissection of these nerves in more than two or three of the spaces. Intercostal Vessels. —The intercostal arteries should be dissected in those spaces in which the nerves have not been traced, and in which, therefore, the internal intercostal muscles are still entire. It is only in a well-injected subject that a satisfactory view of these vessels can be obtained. In each inter- costal space one artery is found passing from behind forwards, and tzvo, the anterior intercostal arteries, running from before backwards. In the upper two spaces the vessels which run from behind forwards are derived from the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery ; in the nine lower spaces they spring directly from the aorta, and are called the aortic intercostals. The anterior intercostal arteries of the upper seven spaces proceed directly from the internal mammary, L

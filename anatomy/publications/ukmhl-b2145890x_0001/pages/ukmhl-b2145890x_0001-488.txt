ABDOMEN. 262 The sciatic artery can be recognised from its being the largest of the branches which spring from the anterior division of the internal iliac, and also from its generally lying a little behind the pudic. It proceeds downwards upon the pyriformis muscle and sacral nerves, and quits the pelvis for the gluteal region through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The ilio-lumhar artery is directed upwards, out- wards, and backwards behind the obturator nerve, the external iliac vessels, and the psoas muscle, to the iHac fossa, where it divides into a lumbar and an iliac branch. The lumbar branch runs upwards and ramifies in the substance of the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles, where it anastomoses with the lower lumbar arteries. It gives off a small spinal branch, which enters the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. The iliac branch breaks up into twigs, which run out- wards, some in the substance of the iliacus muscle, and others between it and the bone; of the latter set, one will be observed to enter the nutrient foramen in the iliac fossa. Reaching the crest of the ilium, the terminal branches of this vessel anastomose with the deep circumflex iliac and lumbar arteries. The gluteal artery is the largest of the branches of the internal iliac. It has a very short course within the pelvis. Passing downwards between the lumbo-sacral cord and the first sacral nerve, it leaves the pelvis through the upper part of the great sacro-

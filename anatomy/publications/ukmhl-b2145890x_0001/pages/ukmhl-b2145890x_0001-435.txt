VENA CAVA INFERIOR. 209 of the vertebrae, behind the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, and then disappear under the cover of the psoas muscle. The two upper arteries also pass behind the crura of the diaphragm and on the right side they are crossed by the inferior vena cava. The lumbar veins join the inferior vena cava, and those of the left side pass behind the aorta. Vena Cava Inferior.—This is the large vein which collects, by means of its tributaries, the venous blood from the lower limbs, the abdominal viscera, and a great part of the abdominal parietes. It is formed on the right side of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra by the union of the two common iliac veins. As it ascends, it lies in the first place upon the vertebral column, close to the right side of the aorta; above the level of the second lumbar vertebra it lies upon the fleshy part of the right crus of the diaphragm which intervenes between it and the aorta ; lastly, it is contained in a deep groove, in the posterior border of the liver, and turning forwards leaves the abdomen by passing through the vena caval opening of the diaphragm, to open into the right auricle of the heart. As it passes upwards it has already been seen to receive the following tributaries :— (I- (2. (3. (4. (5. (6. (7. (8. The common iliac veins. The middle sacral vein. The lumbar veins. The right spermatic or ovarian vein. The renal veins. The right middle capsular vein. The inferior phrenic veins. The hepatic veins. PART II. p

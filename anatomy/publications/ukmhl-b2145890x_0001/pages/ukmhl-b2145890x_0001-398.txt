172 ABDOMEN. (2.) the vena cava and vena portse ; (3.) the crura of the diaphragm, and between these the aorta and the root of the superior mesenteric artery ; (4.) the left kidney and the left suprarenal capsule. It must also be borne in mind that the splenic vein runs behind the gland, and that the two mesenteric veins, in passing up to join this, dip behind its lower border. Its upper border, in the middle line of the body, abuts against the cceliac axis, and to the left of this it is in relation to the splenic artery. Its lower border is related to the transverse part of the duodenum, but is separated from it to a certain extent by the superior mesenteric vessels. Sometimes, however, this artery is enclosed in a tube of gland substance. The duct of the pancreas, called the canal of Wirsung, is embedded in the gland substance. It begins at the tail and runs towards the head, somewhat nearer the lower than the upper border. By dividing the gland, therefore, horizontally along this line, little difficulty will be experienced in discovering it. The extreme whiteness of its walls, and the fact that it is accom- panied by the pancreatica magna artery, are a great help to the student in this dissection. As it approaches the head of the gland it will be observed to gain considerably in diameter, from its being joined by the small ducts which come from the various groups of lobules. Close to the duodenum it comes in contact with the common bile duct, and bending downwards they both pierce in company the coats of the de- scending part of the duodenum upon its inner aspect, and open into the gut by a common orifice.

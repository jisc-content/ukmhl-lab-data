THE PERITONEUM. pouch is the one into which we have opened in opening the cavity of the abdomen. Now it must be clearly understood that these are simply compart- ments of one serous sac, and that they communicate freely with each other through a narrow channel, called the Foramen of Winslow. To find this foramen, the hand must be thrust deeply into the right hypo- chondrium and the forefinger pushed inwards and to the left along the under surface of the liver and behind the right free margin of the gastro-hepatic omentum. It will slip through the foramen of Winslow into the lesser peritoneal sac* The foramen of Winslow has the following bound- aries :â€”in front, right free margin of the gastro- hepatic omentum, between the two layers of which are the hepatic artery, the portal vein, the hepatic duct, and some nerves ; behind, the vena cava, and the right crus of the diaphragm, covered by the layer of the transverse meso-colon, which passes upwards on the posterior wall of the abdomen ;. below, the duodenum ; and above, the lobulus Spigelii of the liver at its junc- tion with the lobulus can^datus. The lesser bag of the peritoneum may be looked upon as a portion of the greater bag invaginated or thrust over towards the left side of the abdominal cavity behind the hepatic vessels. It extends down- wards to the lower free border of the omentum, up- zvards to the under surface of the Spigelian lobe of the * A good way to 'find the foramen of Winslow is to lay hold of the fundus of the gall-bladder with the left hand, and then pass the fore- finger of the right hand backwards along it towards its duct. The finger will slip behind the gastro-hepatic omentum into the foramen. '

Hooking round this border is the recurrent laryngeal branch of the left vagus nerve. lis posterior surface \s in relation to the trachea, oeso- phagus, and thoracic duct, and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The descending portion of the aortic arch lies close against the left side of vertebral column, between it and the left pleura. The oesophagus and thoracic duct lie in relation to its right side, but on a plane somewhat anterior to it. Turn your attention, in the next place, to the three great arteries which spring from the upper surface of the transverse portion of the aortic arch. The Innominate Artery.—The innominate artery is the largest of the three branches. It passes obliquely upwards and to the right, and, gaining the posterior aspect of the right sterno-clavicular articulation, it there ends by dividing into the right common • caro- tid and right subclavian arteries. In front of the vessel is the manubrium sterni, to the posterior aspect of which are attached the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. Further, the artery is crossed superficially, and close to its origin, by the left vena innominata. Behind is the trachea ; but as the vessel inclines to the right, it comes to lie at a higher level upon the right side of the windpipe. To the right side of the artery are the pleura, the right innommate vein and the right phrenic nerve. With the excep- tion' of its two terminal branches, the innommate artery is devoid of branches.

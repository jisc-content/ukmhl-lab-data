INTESTINAL CANAL. 127 The hepatic flextire is the bend which connects the ascending colon with the transverse colon. It is situated in the right hypochondrium. When the colon reaches the concave inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver, it bends slightly forwards and then turns suddenly to the left, and this constitutes the flexure. The transverse colon, continuous on the one hand with the hepatic flexure, and on the other with the splenic flexure, stretches across the abdominal cavity. At first it descends from the right hypochondrium into the umbilical region, and then ascends into the left hypo chondrium. It takes an arched course, the summit of the arch being nearer the anterior wall of the abdomen and at the same time at a lower level in the body than Its extremities. The transverse colon possesses greater freedom of movement than any other part of the great intestine. It is attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a wide peritoneal fold, called the transverse meso-colon. The splenic flexure is the term applied to the bend which the colon takes in the left hypochondrium before proceeding downwards as the descending colon It receives its name from the fact that it lies in mbmate relation with the lower extremity of the spleen.

58 ABDOMEN. They pierce the flattened tendon of the external oblique muscle at variable points, some close to the middle line, and others a little distance from it. Entering the superficial fascia, they run for a short distance outwards. To find these nerves the best plan to adopt is to divide the superficial fascia along the middle line and reflect it cautiously outwards. The small arteries which accompany the nerves serve as guides. The hypogastric nerve is the terminal twig of the ilio-hypogastric, and it lies in series with the pre- ceding. In the dissection of the superficial fascia it has been seen piercing the aponeurosis of the external oblique immediately above the external abdominal ring. The ilio-ingiiinal 7ierve comes out through the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and the inner aspect of the thigh. The lateral cutaneous nerves are branches of the five lower intercostal nerves. They become superficial between the digitations of the external oblique muscle, and then each divides into an anterior and posterior division. The posterior divisions are small, and are directed backwards over the latissimus dorsi. The anterior divisions run forward, and a careful dissector may trace them as far as the outer margin of the rectus. The iliac branch of the last dorsal corresponds with the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves.

196 THORAX. the muscular stratum gives place to a thin membran- ous fascia, called the posterior intercostal membrane, which stretches from the sharply-defined posterior margin of the internal intercostal muscle to the spine. The subcostal muscles are also displayed. They are small fleshy fasciculi placed upon the lower ribs, internal to their angles. The muscular fibres which compose them have the same direction as the internal intercostal muscles, but they extend over one or two intercostal spaces. Remove the posterior intercostal membrane from one or two of the spaces, and the subjacent external intercostal muscles will be brought into view. These muscles reach backwards as far as the tubercles of ribs. Interposed between each of these muscles and the posterior intercostal membrane the dissector will obsei-ve the intercostal vessels and nerve. Intercostal Arteries and Nerves.—The aortic intercostaUrten^s have already been seen taking origin • from the thoracic aorta. One is given to each of the nine lower intercostal spaces upon both sides of the body. As the aorta lies somewhat to the left of the middle line, the right aortic intercostal arteries are lon-er than those of the left side. In both cases they run outwards over the bodies of the vertebrae, and under cover of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic^ On the right side the arteries also pass under cover of the oesophagus, the thoracic duct, and the vena azygos major As they leave the vertebral column to entei

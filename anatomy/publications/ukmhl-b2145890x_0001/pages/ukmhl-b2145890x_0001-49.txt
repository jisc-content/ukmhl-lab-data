FRONT AND INNER BORDER OF FOREARM. 37 adipose tissue. Note the great strength of this fascia, and this more especially in the lower third of the forearm, where the fleshy bellies of the subjacent muscles give place to the tendons. Remove the fascia from the front of the forearm. This can only be done in part, because the muscles which spring by a common origin from the internal condyle of the humerus are all more or less inseparably united to it at this point, as well as to the septa which it sends down between them. In dissecting the aponeurosis round the ulnar margin of the limb note its firm attachment to the posterior border of the ulna. FRONT AND INNER BORDER OP FOREARM. In this region we have to dissect out the following structures :— (i.) The radial and ulnar arteries and their branches. (2.) The ulnar and median nerves and their branches;, also the posterior interosseous and radial nerves. (3.) The pronator and flexor muscles. Radial Artery.—When an artery lies superficially in its whole course through a particular region, it is a good rule to begin the dissection of the region by cleaning it and the parts in immediate relation to it, before we disturb the neighbouring muscles. In this way the dissector obtains a very much better idea of the relations of the vessel. We followed this rule with the brachial artery, and now let us do likewise with the radial artery, which, like the brachial, is not covered by any muscular stmcture in its course

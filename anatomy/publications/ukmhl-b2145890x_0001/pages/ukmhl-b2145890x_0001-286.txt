62 ABDOMEN. Opening thus formed are prolonged downwards upon the cord in the form of a thin membrane called the external spermatic fascia. In defining this the blade of the knife must be discarded. Work entirely with the handle. The obliqims externus arises by eight pointed pro- cesses or digitations from the outer surfaces and lower borders of the eight lower ribs (Fig. 8). Of these, the upper five interdigitate with the digitations of the serratus magnus, and the lower three with those of the latissimus dorsi. From this origin the fibres proceed downwards and forwards with varying degrees of obliquity. The posterior fibres have a nearly vertical direction, and are inserted into the anterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium. The sicperior fibres are almost horizontal, and the intermediate fibres are directed obliquely downwards and forwards, and both end in a strong aponeurosis called the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique. Superiorly the aponeurosis of the external oblique is very thin, and is carried forwards to be attached to the ensiform cartilage. It is from this part of it that the pectoralis major derives fibres of origin. Inferiorly it is attached to Poupart's ligament, which, indeed, is simply the thickened lower border of the aponeurosis folded back upon itself Between iJiese attachments it proceeds forwards over the rectus, and is inserted into the linea alba and into the front of the os pubis. In connection with this aponeurosis note that it is broadest and strongest inferiorly, that it is narrowest

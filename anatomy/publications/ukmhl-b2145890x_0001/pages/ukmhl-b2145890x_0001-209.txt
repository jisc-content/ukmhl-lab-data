THORACIC WALL. 197 the intercostal spaces, each of the vessels gives off a large dorsal brancJi which passes backwards in the interval between the transverse processes and is dis- tributed to the muscles and skin of the back. From this branch a few twigs are supplied to the spinal cord and its membranes through the intervertebral foramen. In each space the intercostal artery proceeds outwards, first lying between the posterior intercostal membrane and the external intercostal muscle, and afterwards between the two muscular strata. Each artery is accompanied by a nerve and a vein. The vein usually occupies the highest level, the nerve the lozvest level, whilst the artery is intei^inediate. The distribution of these vessels in the thoracic parietes has already been studied {vide p. 146). The intercostal arteries which supply the tzvo highest intercostal spaces are derived from the siiperioi^ inter- costal artery of the subclavian. The superior intercostal artery descends upon the necks of the first two ribs, and external to the gangliated cord. It anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal artery, and sends out- wards two vessels for the two highest spaces. Each of these, in turn, gives off a dorsal branch similar to the dorsal branches of the aortic intercostal arteries. The i?itercostal nerves pass outwards in company with the arteries. The communicating twigs which pass between these nerves and the sympathetic ganglia have already been noted. Each nerve lies at a lower level than the corresponding artery, and is at f^rst placed between the posterior intercostal membrane and the external intercostal muscle, and then between

FRONT OF THE THIGH. 87 femoral artery occupies the outermost compartment; the femoral vein fills up the middle compartment; whilst in the innermost compartment is lodged a little loose areolar tissue, a small lymphatic gland, and some lymphatic vessels. This last compartment, from its relation to femoral hernia, has the special name of crural canal applied to it. Its boundaries and extent must be very thoroughly studied by the student. The best way to do this is to introduce the little finger into it and gently push it upwards. Its length is not nearly so great as that of the other two compartments. Indeed, its extent is rarely more than one inch. Its superior aperture is called the crural ring, and this is closed by the closely-applied extra-peritoneal fatty tissue. The parts which immediately surround this ring can be readily detected with the finger: externally the femoral vein, internally the sharp crescentic base of Gimbernafs ligament, anteriorly Pouparts ligament, and posteriorly the pubic bone covered by the pectineus muscle. That portion of the extra-peritoneal fat which closes the ring is called the septum crurale* Scarpa's Triangle.â€”This is the name which is given to the triangular hollow which lies below Poupart's ligament. To bring its boundaries into view the deep fascia must be removed from the anterior aspect of the upper third of the thigh. In the lower two-thirds the fascia lata should be left * Should it so happen that the walls of the abdomen have been dissected, and the cavity of the abdomen opened into, the ivfo dissectors should together examine the femoral sheath and crural canal from above.

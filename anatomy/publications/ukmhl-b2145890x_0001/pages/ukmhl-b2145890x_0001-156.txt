144 THORAX. of the intercostal arteries which lie between the two muscular strata. The internal intercostal muscles thus laid bare will be seen to be similar in their constitution to the external muscles. The fibres, however, run in the opposite direction—viz., from above, obliquely down- wards and backwards. Moreover, the muscles are prolonged forwards to the sternum. Posteriorly they reach backwards to the angles of the ribs, from which to the spine, this stratum is continued in the form of a thin membrane—the posterior intercostal membraite—which, will be seen after the thorax has been opened. If the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen has not been removed, the dissector should note how the anterior fibres of the two lowest internal intercostal muscles become continuous with the fibres of that muscle. Intercostal Nerves.—The intercostal nerves are altogether out of sight in the present stage of the dissection. They are hidden by the lower borders of the ribs which bound the intercostal spaces superiorly. By gently pulling upon their lateral cutaneous branches they can be drawn downwards, and they are then seen to lie between the two muscular strata as far forward as a point midway between the spine and sternum. Here they disappear from view by sinking into the substance of the internal intercostal muscles, amidst the fibres of which they may be traced as far as the anterior extremities of the bony ribs. They now reach the deep surface of these muscles and are

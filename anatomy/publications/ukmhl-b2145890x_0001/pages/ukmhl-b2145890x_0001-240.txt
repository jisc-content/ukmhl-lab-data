l6 ABDOMEN. superficial perineal muscles. It is accompanied by the superficial perineal nerves. The transverse perineal artery is a small vessel which usually springs from the pudic by a common root of origin with the preceding. It pierces the base of the triangular ligament, and, gaining the surface of the transversus perinei muscle, proceeds transversely in- wards to the interval between the rectum and the bulb, where it ends by supplying the parts in this locality, and by anastomosing with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The posterior siipei^ficial perineal nerve, a branch of the perineal division of the pudic nerve, has already been seen in the anterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, where it effects a communication with the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. It leaves the fossa by piercing the base of the triangular ligament, and is continued forwards with the superficial perineal artery to the scrotum. The anterior superficial perineal nerve, also derived from the perineal part of the pudic nerve, supplies a few twigs to the levator ani, and, piercing the base of the triangular ligament, is prolonged forward with the posterior nerve to the scrotum. In some instances this nerve passes under cover of the transversus perinei muscle. The long pudendal nerve is derived from an altogether different source. It is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, and pierces the deep fascia of the thigh a short distance in front of the tuber ischii and about an inch and a-half to the outer side of the margin of the pubic

171 THE PANCREAS. to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where it ends, in the jejunum. The extremity of the duo- denum is supported in this position by a band of non-striated muscular fibres, called the suspensory muscle, which descends from the coeliac axis and the left crus of the diaphragm. This part of the duo- denum is only partially covered by peritoneum. It lies between the two layers of the transverse meso- colon, where they reach the spine, and the descending layer of this fold is borne off its anterior aspect by the superior mesenteric vessels. Behind the third part of the duodenum are the vena cava and the left renal vein, the aorta and the two crura of the diaphragm ; in front it is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein ; above it is in contact with the lower border of the pancreas. The Pancreas is a flattened elongated gland which stretches across the posterior wall of the abdomen at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. Its enlarged right extremity, which is termed the head^ is embraced by the concavity of the duodenum ; its tapering left extremity, called the tail, is in contact with the lower part of the concave surface of the spleen. Its position is therefore somewhat oblique, its tail being higher than its head. The relations of this gland are very complicated. Its anterior surface is separated from the posterior aspect of the stomach by the lesser bag of the peritoneum, and is covered by the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. The posterior surface is in contact from right to left withâ€”(i.) the bile duct;

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE WRIST AND HAND. 49 pollicis, the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and the extensor indicis. Lastly, reflect the anconeus muscle by detaching it from the external condyle and throwing it inwards towards its insertion. This will give the dissector a better view of the supinator brevis, and display the recur7xnt branch of the posterior interosseous artery ascending to the back of the external condyle. The Anastomosis around the elbow-joint should now be reviewed as a whole. A distinct inosculation will be found to take place upon both the anterior and posterior aspect of each condyle of the humerus. Behind the external condyle the posterior interosseous recurrent joins the posterior branch of the superior profimda; in front of the same condyle the anterior branch of the superior profunda communicates with the radial recurrent. On the inner side of the joint the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries ascend respectively in front of and behind the internal con- ' dyle, and anastomose, the former with the afiterior branch of the anastomotic^ and the latter with both the anastomotic and the inferior profunda. DORSAL ASPECT OP THE WRIST AND HAND. There still remain to be examined in this locality :â€” (i.) The radial artery and its branches. (2.) The posterior annular ligament. (3.) The extensor tendons. It is only a very small part of the radial which is. E

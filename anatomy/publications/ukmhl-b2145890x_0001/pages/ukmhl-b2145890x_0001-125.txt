ANTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. II3 The anterior tibial nerve lies to the outer side of the dorsalis pedis artery. It has ah-eady been seen to become superficial in the first interosseous space and supply the contiguous sides of the hallux and second toe. Before it pierces the fascia it gives off a large branch which passes outwards under cover of the extensor brevis digitorum, to which it gives branches, and swelling out in a gangliform manner, it ends in twigs to the articulations of the foot. It likewise, in many cases, supplies delicate twigs to the first and second dorsal interosseous muscles. Anterior Annular Ligament.â€”The dissector should again examine this ligament and the arrange- ment of the structures which pass under it, seeing that all these are now fully dissected. The upper portion is attached to the fibula by its outer end, and to the tibia by its inner extremity. By dividing its fibular attach- ment and throwing it inwards, it will be seen to give a separate and distinct sheath to the tibialis anticus. The lower portion is the more important of the two. Its attachments have already been noted. Examine closely the manner in which it holds the tendons in their place. It consists of two layers, and these, by separating at certain points and becoming reunited at others, form three distinct sheaths. Through the inner- most passes the tendon of the tibialis anticus ; through the middle one passes the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis ; and through the outermost are trans- mitted the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius. On opening up these sheaths I

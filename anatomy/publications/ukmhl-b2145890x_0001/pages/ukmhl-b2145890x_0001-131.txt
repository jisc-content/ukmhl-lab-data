POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 119 nerviis comniunicans tibialis pierces the deep fascia midway between the knee and ankle, and a short distance below this it is joined by the nervus com- municans fibularis, and then acquires the name of external saphenous. On the outer aspect of the leg certain branches of the external popliteal nerve are to be dissected out. The largest of these—the nervus communicants fibularis —must be traced downwards to the point at which it joins the nervus communicans tibialis. The nerve which results from this junction is called the external saphenous. Deep Fascia.—A continuous view of the deep fascia can now be obtained by removing the remains of the superficial fat. Observe how thin and trans- parent it is in the upper part of the leg, and how it thickens as it is followed downwards towards the heel. At no point, however, is it very dense. As it passes over the interval between the heel and internal malleolus it forms the internal annular ligament. Divide the fascia along the middle line and turn it outwards and inwards. Leave the internal annular hgament intact. On raising the inner part of the fascia it will be seen to be attached to the tibia. In fact, it blends with the periosteum covering the inner surface of this bone. On turning the outer portion of fascia outwards it will be observed to be directly continuous with the fascia on the front of the leg ; further, the strong intermuscular septum which passes in to join the fibula between the peronei muscles and

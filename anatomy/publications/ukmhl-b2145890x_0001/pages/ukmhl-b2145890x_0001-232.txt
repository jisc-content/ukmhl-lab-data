8 ABDOMEN. superficial fascia to the base of the triangular ligament; it cannot pass down the inner aspect of the thighs from the attachment of the fascia to the sides of tl^^e pubic arch; it can only force its way forwards jinder the superficial fascia and dartos muscle of the scrotum, and from this on to the penis and along the spermatic cords to the anterior aspect of the abdomen. By this means the dissector obtains a very striking view of the course which would be taken by urine escaping from a rupture in the urethra in front of the triangular ligament. The attachments of this fascia are so important that the student should also test them by dissection. To do this it is necessar)^ to make two incisions through the superficial fascia. Enter the knife in the middle line, at the root of the scrotum, and carry it backwards and outwards to the tuber ischii on each side of the body. A central A shaped flap and two lateral flaps of fascia are thus marked out. By raising and turning backwards the central portion, the septum of the pouch is brought into view, and the attachment of the fascia, to the base of the triangular ligament is demon- strated, and by throwing each lateral flap outwards it will be seen to be firmly fixed to the side of the pubic arch. In effecting this dissection the utmost care is demanded on the part of the student. In the areolar tissue immediately subjacent to the superficial fascia are the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, which are certain to be injured, or perhaps even reflected with the fascia, unless the greatest caution be exercised.

The superior hsemorrhoidal J ^ The Internal Iliac Artery.—This is a short, wide vessel which commences opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation, at the bifurcation of the common iliac. It proceeds downwards and backwards into the pelvis, and ends near the upper part of the great sciatic notch by dividing into an anterior and posterior division. In length it measures about one and a-half inches, and its calibre in the adult is considerably smaller than that of the external iliac. In front, it is clothed by the peritoneum, and crossed by the ureter; whilst behind, it rests upon the pyriformis muscle, the lumbo- sacral cord, and the internal iliac vein. The imper- vious hypogastric artery extends forwards from its extremity. Condition in the Foetus.—Very different is the condition of the internal iliac artery in the foetus. It is termed the hypo- gastric artery, and is twice as large as the external iliac. Instead of terminating at the sciatic notch, it extends forwards to the side of the bladder, upon which it ascends to reach the abdo- minal parietes. Continuing its course upwards upon the posterior aspect of the anterior wall of the abdomen, it gains the umbili- cal orifice, through which it passes in company with its fellow of the opposite side and the umbilical vein. Outside the abdominal cavity the hypogastric arteries are important factors in the con- stitution of the umbilical cord, and, twining spirally around the umbilical vein, they reach the placenta, where the impure blood which they hold is brought into relation with the maternal blood.

LOWER LIMB. 122 comites, and the nerve lies first to the inner side of the vessels, but soon crosses over them and runs downwards in close contact with them externally. Observe that the three vessels and the nerve rest first upon the tibialis posticus, then upon the flexor longus digitorum, and lastly upon the lower end of the tibia and upon the ankle-joint. Now replace the superficial muscles, and you will notice how deeply they lie in the upper half of their course ; below this, however, they escape from under cover of these muscles, and are covered simply by the two layers of fascia and the internal annular ligament. The branches of the posterior tibial artery should now be studied. They areâ€”(i.) peroneal, (2.) the muscular to the neighbouring muscles, (3.) nutrient, (4.) communicating. The Jiutrie?it artery springs from the posterior tibial close to its commencement, and giving some twigs to muscles, enters the nutrient foramen of the tibia. The communicating artery is given off at the lower end of the tibia, and passing transversely across the back of the tibia, joins the posterior peroneal artery. The peroneal artery is the large branch which proceeds from the posterior tibial about one inch below the lower margin of the popliteus muscle. In the present dissection it is seen running obliquely outwards and downwards upon the tibialis posticus to reach the fibula. It is covered in this part of its course by the soleus, and is accompanied by the nerve to the flexor longus hallucis. This artery should not be traced further at present as it sinks

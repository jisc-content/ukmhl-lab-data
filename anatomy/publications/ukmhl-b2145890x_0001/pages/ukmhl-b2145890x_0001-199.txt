POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 187 tween the subclavian artery and the right innominate vein, and descends by the side of the trachea to the posterior aspect of the root of the right lung. Here it breaks up into the right posterior ptdmonary plexus, and, issuing from this in the form of two nervous cords, it takes part in the formation of the plexus gulce '. It leaves this plexus upon the posterior aspect of the oesophagus, and, entering the abdomen through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, it is distri- buted to the stomach upon its posterior surface. The pneumogastric nerves give off the following branches within the thorax :â€” (i.) Recurrent laryngeal. (2.) Thoracic cardiac. (3.) Pulmonary. , (4.) QEsophageal. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve springs from the pneumogastric as it. crosses the arch of the aorta. It hooks round the transverse part of the aortic arch, and reaching the trachea, ascends by the side of this to the larynx. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve arises in the root of the neck, and hooks round the sub- clavian artery. The thoracic cardiac branches of the right side pro- ceed in part from the pneumogastric and in part from the recurrent laryngeal nerve of that side. On the left side of the body they are derived from the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The pulmonary - branches have already been studied in connection with the root of the lung {vide p. 157). The oesophageal branches are dispensed to the gullet

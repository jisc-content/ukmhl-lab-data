PERITONEUM. 229 gives a partial covering. The first part of the rectum it invests completely, and connects by means of a fold called the meso-rectum to the anterior surface of the sacrum. Gradually it leaves the gut, first disappear- ing from its posterior surface, then from its lateral, and finally from its anterior surface, and passes on to the lower and back part of the bladder. The point at which the peritoneum departs from the rectum may be stated to be about three inches above the anus, or, in other words, along a line connecting the middle points of the two vesiculae seminalesâ€”some- what less than an inch from the base of the prostate. This is a point, however, which is subject to much variation. It is affected by the full or empty condi- tion of the bladder or rectum. When either viscus is distended, the peritoneum rises with it, and the line of reflection is placed at a greater distance from the prostate. But, again, it is not uncommon to find the peritoneum passing lower down; and, in rare instances, it may even reach the base of the prostate before it is continued on to the bladder. The peritoneum now ascends upon the back of the bladder, and reaching the summit, is conducted from it by the urachus on to the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall. On each side of the viscus it extends outwards as far as the obliterated hypo- gastric artery, along the line of which it quits the bladder, and is continued round the pelvic wall.

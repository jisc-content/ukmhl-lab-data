The obturator internus and pyrifonnis muscles should now be studied. They are described at page 274. The viscera should next be separated from each other, but the vagina must be left attached to the uterus, and the urethra to the bladder.

Bladder.—All further particulars regarding the bladder may be obtained by turning back to p. 277. In slitting open this viscus the urethra should be laid open along its upper surface at the same time. Urethra.—The external meatus is the narrowest part of this tube. As it is traced upwards, it will be seen to expand before joining the neck of the bladder, and close to the meatus its floor will be noticed to be somewhat depressed so as to form a slight hollow. Interior of the Uterus.—The uterus with its appendages should now be laid upon its posterior surface on a block, and opened by a longitudinal mesial incision, extending from the fundus to os uteri externum.

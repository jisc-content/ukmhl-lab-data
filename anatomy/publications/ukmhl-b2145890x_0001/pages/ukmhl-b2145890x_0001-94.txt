82 LOWER LIMB. sources. Three come from the lumbar plexus, and three are branches of the anterior crural:— (Ilio-inguinal. From lumbar plexus. X Crural branch of genito-cniral. I External cutaneous. C Middle cutaneous. From anterior crural. \ Internal cutaneous. V Long saphenous. The ilio-inguinal nerve will be found as it escapes from the external abdominal ring in company with the spermatic cord. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve pierces the fascia a little way below Poupart's ligament, and to the outer side of the femoral artery. With a little care a communication between this nerve and the middle cutaneous may be made out. The external cutaneous is found on the outer aspect of the thigh. It pierces the deep fascia in two parts. Of these, one—the posterior division—appears about two inches below the anterior superior iliac spine, and proceeds backwards and downwards. Some twigs of this nerve may be followed to the gluteal region. The «72^m^?r division comes to the surface about two inches lower down. It is the largest of the two, and has a wide area of distribution. The middle cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia lata in the middle line of the thigh about three inches below Poupart's ligament. It usually appears as two nerves which perforate the fascia at two points. The internal cutaneous also divides into two before it reaches the superficial fascia. The anterior division makes its appearance in the lower part of the thigh near the

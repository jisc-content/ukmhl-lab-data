42 UPPER LIMB. Superficial Structures.—The palmaris brevis muscle must first be displayed. Carry the knife transversely inwards through the granular fat on the ulnar margin of the palm immediately below the anterior annular ligament. The fleshy fibres of the muscle will come into view, and these must be cleaned. Next trace the palmai' cutaneous twigs from the median and ulnar nerves to their terminations, and then remove the fatty tissue which conceals the palmar fascia. Palmar Fascia.—Follow the four slips into which the central portion divides, and make out their con- nections at the roots of the fingers. Between the slips the digital vessels and nerves will be seen. Observe the transverse fibres which bind the slips together, and note the great contrast in strength and density between the central part of the fascia and the thin lateral portions which invest the short muscles of the thumb and little finger. Reflect the palmar fascia by dividing it transversely below the anterior annular ligament and throwing it downwards towards the fingers. Superficial Palmar Arch.—This is the most superficial of the structures now exposed. Study carefully its mode of formation, and follow its digital branches. For this purpose it will be necessary to reflect the skin from the front of the fingers by making a vertical incision along the middle line of each. The ulnar artery will be seen to take the chief part in forming the arch. On the outer side of the palm

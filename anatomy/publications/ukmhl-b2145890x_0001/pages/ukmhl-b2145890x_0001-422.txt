iq6 abdomen. they ascend. In making this dissection be careful not to injure the phrenic arteries which ramify upon this aspect of the diaphragm or the nerves which accompany them. The diaphragm, as Haller has put it, is, after the heart, the most important muscle in the body. It forms the dome-shaped roof of the abdomen, and the highly arched and convex floor of the thorax. It is the chief muscle of inspiration. Each respiratory act is accompanied by a descent and ascent of its muscular part, and in this way the capacity of the thoracic cavity is alternately increased and decreased in the vertical direction. The vault or cupola of the diaphragm is higher on the right side than upon the left side of the body. In forced expiration it rises on the right side as high as the upper margin of the fourth rib close to the sternum ; whereas on the left side it only reaches the upper border of the fifth rib. The central portion of the diaphragm is tendinous. From this the fleshy fibres will be observed to radiate and at the same time to arch downwards, so as to obtain attachment to the circumference of the lower aperture or outlet of the thorax. In front, it takes origin from the back of the lowest segment of the sternum ; behind, it springs by two partly fleshy and partly tendinous processes called the crura, from the bodies of the upper three lumbar vertebrae, and upon each side of these from two ligamentous arches, termed the ligamenta arcuata; laterally, it arises from the lower six costal arches. Examine each of these attachments in turn.

257 PELVIC BLOOD-VESSELS. bladder is separated from the rectum by the recto- vesical layer of pelvic fascia alone. It occasionally happens that in retention of urine, it is im- possible to pass a catheter into the bladder to relieve the distention. In these cases it becomes necessary to puncture the bladder with a trocar and canula. The foregoing facts concerning the relations of this viscus will show that the operation may be performed at two points without injury to the peritoneumâ€”^viz., (i.) in the middle line immediately above the pubic symphysis ; (2.) through the rectum and within the limits of the triangular space on the base of the bladder. In the dis- tended condition of the bladder, the peritoneum is absent from its walls at both of these points. The latter method is the one which is preferable, except where the retention is due to enlargement of the prostate, in which case it would in all probability be impossible to reach the point at which the puncture should be made. The middle line must be adhered to rigorously in both methods. Pelvic Blood-Vessels. The blood-vessels of the pelvis should now be followed out. For this purpose it is necessary to remove the stuffing from the rectum, and allow the air to escape from the bladder. The peritoneum upon the left side and the loose tissue around the vessels must be dissected away. Accompanying the arteries the dissector should notice numbers of fine nervous twigs from the pelvic plexus, and from the third and fourth sacral nerves. Preserve these as far as it is possible to do so. Upon the right side the blood- vessels are more or less injured, and some of them severed, by the removal of the innominate bone; on the left side, however, they are intact. PART II. S

THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. 167 auricle to the point of entrance of the inferior vena cava. In making this incision care must be taken not to injure the Eustachian valve—a fold of endocardium placed in front of the mouth of the inferior vena cava. (2.) An oblique incision carried from about the middle of the first cut to the tip of the auricular appendix. The dark venous blood should now be washed away from the interior of the auricle with a sponge. The internal surface of the .cavity presents a smooth glossy appearance, due to its endocardial lining. In the auricular appendix the wall is raised into a series of closely-applied parallel ridges called the musculi pectinati, from their resemblance to the teeth of a comb. These ridges are also present on the anterior wall of the auricle. The blood enters the auricle by the following open- ings :—(i.) the opening of the superior vena cava; (2.) the opening of the inferior vena cava \ (3.) the opening of the coronary sinus ; (4.) the orifices of one or two anterior cardiac veins from the surface of the right ventricle ; (5.) the foramina Thebesii. The blood flows out of the cavity, into the right ven- tricle, through the large auriculo-ventricular opening. The orifice of the superior vena cava is situated at the upper part of the auricle. The inferior vena cava opens into the lower part of the cavity. The dissector should note that these two veins are so directed that the currents of blood, which flow from them into the auricle, shall not be opposed, the one against the other. The blood of the superior vena cava is directed towards the auriculo-ventricular opening, whilst the stream of

191 POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. areolar tissue and glands in the posterior mediastinal space. The iJitercostal brandies will be observed arising in pairs from the posterior aspect of the aorta. Defer their examination, however, until the thoracic duct and the sympathetic cord have been dissected. The Thoracic Duct.â€”The thoracic duct, although a vessel of small calibre, is a highly important duct. It receives all the lymphatic vessels of the body below the diaphragm, the lymphatics of the left side of the chest (including the left lung and left side of the heart), and the lymphatics of the left superioi^ extremity and left side of the head and neck. It will be found by dissecting in the loose areolar tissue which lies between the aorta and the vena azygos major. Its diameter is not much greater than whip-cord, and it will be recognised from its position and by the great elasticity which it exhibits when it is pulled by the forceps. Trace it downwards, and it will be found to enter the thorax upon the right side of the aorta, and through the same opening in the diaphragm. It com- mences within the abdomen upon the second lumbar vertebra in a dilatation called the receptaciilum chyli. Follow it upwards, and you will notice that it gradu- ally inclines to the left. At the level of the fourth dorsal vertebra it passes behind the aortic arch and cesophagus. It now ascends to the neck between the oesophagus and left pleura, and ends by joining the internal jugular vein at its point of union with the subclavian vein. As it passes upwards through the

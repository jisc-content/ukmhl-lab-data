57 GLUTEAL REGION. margin of the gluteus maximus muscle to reach the skin over this region are a few offsets from the small sciatic nerve, and they can be very readily found by cutting directly down upon the muscle in this position, and carrying the knife in a direction trans- verse to that of the muscular fibres. They appear at different levels, and are in some cases accompanied by small arterial twigs from the sciatic artery. The Deep Fascia, in the next place, claims the attention of the dissector. This is brought into view by removing the remnants of the superficial fascia. Observe the marked contrast between the fascia covering the gluteus maximus and that clothing the anterior exposed portion of the gluteus medius. Over the gluteus maximus, it is present in the form of a thin transparent layer, through which the muscular' fibres are plainly visible, whilst over the gluteus medius it constitutes a strong, opaque, pearly-white aponeurosis, which is firmly attached by its upper limit to the crest of the ilium. Gluteus Maximus.—Now proceed to clean this muscle. If it is 'the right limb, begin at the anterior or upper margin of the muscle; but if it is the left, commence the dissection at the posterior or lower border. In undertaking this dissection, the dissector must keep clearly before him the rules which have already been laid down regarding the cleaning of a muscle:—(i.) Render the fibres as tense as possible by rotating the limb inwards. (2.) Remove the fascia in one continuous layer. (3.) Always cut in the

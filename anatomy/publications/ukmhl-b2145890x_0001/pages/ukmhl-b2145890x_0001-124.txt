112 LOWER LIMB. by piercing the interosseous membrane about two inches above the outer malleolus. Follow it downwards to its distribution on the outer aspect of the ankle- joint. It is the anterior or perforating terminal twig of the peroneal branch of the posterior tibial artery. Dorsalis Pedis Artery—Anterior Tibial Nerve on the Dorsum of Foot.—The arteria dorsalis pedis should now be followed as it runs forwards upon the dorsum of the foot. At the posterior part of the first interosseous space it will be seen to dip downwards between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, so as to gain the sole of the foot. A short way behind this point the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum crosses it. Observe how it lies in relation to the other tendons on the dorsum of the foot. To its inner side is the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis; to its outer side is a tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. It gives off three branches :—(i.) the tarsal, (2.) the metatarsal, and (3.) dorsalis hallucis. The tarsal artery arises opposite the scaphoid bone and the metatarsal branch a little further forwards. They both run outwards under cover of the extensor brevis digitorum to reach the outer margin of the foot. From the arch which is formed by the metatarsal artery three interosseous arteries proceed—one to each of the three outer interosseous spaces. The dorsalis hallucis artery springs from the dorsalis pedis just before it disappears from view, and it runs forwards in the innermost interosseous space.

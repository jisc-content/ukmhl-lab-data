7 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. here it will be seen to spring from the transversalis colli. The posterior scapular artery, which likewise proceeds from the transversalis colli, will then be seen to sink under cover of the levator anguli scapulae. Omo-hyoid—Suprascapular Artery andNerve.— The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid and the supra- scapular artery and nerve can now be displayed by dissecting towards the superior margin of the scapula. The dissector of the head and neck must take part in this dissection. Upon no account expose these structures for more than one inch from the upper margin of the scapula. Rhomboids.—The rhomboideus major and minor should next engage the attention of the student. Draw the scapula well over the edge of the block which supports the chest of the subject. The fibres are thus rendered tense, and the cleaning of the muscles greatly facilitated. Note how the larger of the two muscles is usually inserted, in great part, into the base of the scapula, through the medium of a tendinous arch. The Nerve to the Rhomboids can best be detected by dissecting in the cellular interval between the rhomboideus minor and the levator anguli scapulae about one inch to the inside of the superior angle of the scapula ; or it may be seen upon the deep surface of the muscles after they are reflected. Levator Anguli Scapulae.—In defining and clean- ing this muscle care must be taken of the nerves which pass to it from the cervical plexus and also of the nerve to the rhomboids and the posterior scapular

88 LOWER LIMB. undisturbed, so as to maintain the parts as far as possible in their natural position. Boundaries.—The outer boundary is formed by the sartorius as it runs downwards and inwards across the thigh, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and the inner boundary is constituted by the prominent internal margin of the adductor longus. Clean these muscles down to the point where they meet to form the apex of the triangle. Pouparts ligament is the base of the triangle.

Remove the remains of the femoral sheath and define the various branches which proceed from the vessels in so far as they are seen within the limits of the triangular space. Be very careful not to injure the small nerve which springs from the anterior crural and passes inwards behind the vessels to supply the

162 ABDOMEN. branches, viz.:—(i.) the coronary, (2.) the hepatic, and (3.) the splenic, which radiate from each other like the spokes of a wheel. The coeliac axis is sur- rounded by a thick plexus of nerves, called the coeliac plexus, which sends numerous nervous twigs with the three branches which spring from the axis. The coeliac plexus must be left undisturbed, and in following the coronary, hepatic, and splenic arteries the nerves which accompany them must be carefully preserved. The Coronary Artery, the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, proceeds upwards and to the left to the oesophageal opening of the stomach. Here it changes its direction, enters between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum, and runs from above downwards and to the right along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Near the pylorus it ends by anastomosing with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The branches of the coronary artery are :— (i.) GEsophageal. (2.) Gastric. The oesophageal arteries spring from the coronary at the point where it reaches the stomach. They pass up- wards upon the posterior aspect of the gullet, through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, and anastomose with the oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. The gastric branches take origin from the coronar>' as it runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and are distributed to both surfaces of this viscus.

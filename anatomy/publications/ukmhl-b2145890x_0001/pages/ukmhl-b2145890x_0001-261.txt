37 FEMALE PERINEUM. external anatomy of the urethral triangle demands the careful study of the student, because here we find the external organs of generation. They areâ€” (i.) The mons Veneris. (4.) The clitoris. (2.) The labia majora. (5.) The urethral opening. (3.) The labia minora. (6.) The vaginal orifice. All these parts are included under the common term of Vulva. The Mons Veneris is a marked cushion-like emin- ence situated in front of the pubes. This projection is due to a collection of adipose tissue under the integu- ment. It is covered with short crispy hair. The Labia Majora correspond to the scrotum in the male, cleft along the middle line. They are two rounded folds, which commence in front at the mons Veneris and extend downwards and backwards towards the anus. They diminish in thickness as they proceed backwards, and anteriorly they unite to constitute the anterior commissure, whilst posteriorly, about one inch in front of the anus, they join to form the posterior commissure. Externally, they are covered by skin studded with scattered hairs, whilst internally they are coated with smooth humid integument, the free sur- face of which is lubricated by an unctuous semi-solid secretion, derived from numerous follicular glands which open upon it. During parturition, the labia majora are unfolded and effaced, and thus give the vagina a greater capability of dilatation. The labia majora enclose an elliptical fissure, which IS termed the itro-genital fissure or opening on account

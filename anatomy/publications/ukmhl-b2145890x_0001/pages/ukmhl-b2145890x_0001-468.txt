242 ABDOMEN. feriorly, it is attached to the base of the triangular ligament, which, as we have seen, is on the same mor- phological plane as the bone; consequently this attach- ment is quite in keeping with the attachment of the fascia further back, to the tuberosity of the ischium, and to the sciatic ligaments. Visceral Layer of Pelvic Fascia.—In the greater part of its extent the visceral pelvic fascia springs from the inner surface of the parietal pelvic fascia, along the white line. In front, however, it has a limited attachment to the back of the body of the pubic bone above the attachment of the parietal layer. It is from the portion of bone between these layers that the anterior fibres of the levator ani arise. The visceral pelvic fascia now passes inwards upon the upper surface of the levator ani muscle to the side of the prostate and the base of the bladder, and divides into three layers, termed—(I.) the vesical; (2.) the recto-vesical; and (3.) the rectal. These have different connections, according to the point at which they are examined. In the region of the bladder, the splitting of the visceral pelvic fascia takes place at the outer margin of thevesicula seminalis, and the vesical, or higliest layer, turns upwards upon the lower part of the side of the bladder, and constitutes its ''lateral true ligament:' Upon the wall of this viscus the vesical prolongation gradually thins away until it is ultimately lost upon its coats. The recto-vesical, or intermediate layer, is carried inwards between the bladder and the rectum, and, in the mesial plane, it becomes continuous with

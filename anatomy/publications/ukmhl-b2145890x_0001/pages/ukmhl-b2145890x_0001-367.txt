THE PERITONEUM. 141 the ascending and descending portions of the colon. These they clothe anteriorly and laterally, as we have already seen, and then they are carried on to the anterior wall of the abdomen, where they become continuous. Peritoneal Ligaments.—In the abdomen proper, the student must specially examine—(i.) the gastro- phrenic ligament; (2.) the phrenico-splenic ligament; (3.) the phrenico-colic ligament'; and (4.) the hepatic ligaments. The gastro-phrenic ligament is a fold which connects the fundus of the stomach with the under surface of the diaphragm. It is placed close to the oesophageal open- ing, on its left side, and is formed entirely by that layer which ascends over the anterior surface of the fundus of the stomach to reach the diaphragm. It is simply a reduplication or exaggerated wrinkle of this layer. It is interesting to note that the stomach is not com- pletely covered by peritoneum. There is a small area of a somewhat triangular form situated on its posterior surface immediately below the oesophagus, which is bare, and rests directly upon the left crus of the diaphragm.* 1^^^ phrenico-splenic, and the phrenico-colic ligaments have been already noticed. The ligaments of tJie liver are five in number—viz., (I.) the ligamentum teres; (2.) the falciform ligament ; (3.) the coronary ligament; (4.)'the right lateral, and (5.) the left lateral ligaments. The ligamentum teres is not a peritoneal ligament, An7omv in'tV^T^ ^'^•^•S" Demonstrator of UoToT/r^^^: Brir ^' ^'"^ ^'"^ ^^'^

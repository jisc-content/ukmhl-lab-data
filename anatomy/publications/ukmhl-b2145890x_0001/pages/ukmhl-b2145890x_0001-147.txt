SOLE OF THE FOOT. inserted one upon each side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. The adductor hallucis has a very oblique position in the sole and hides to a great extent the interossei muscles. It lies to the outer side of the flexor brevis hallucis. The transversus pedis is placed transversely across the heads of the metatarsal bones. Its close association with the adductor hallucis is not generally recognised. Both are adductors of the hallux, and in some animals (certain monkeys) the two muscles are blended. Again, according to Ruge, at an early stage of the human embryo they lie side by side, in close apposition with each other, and it is only as development advances that they become separate by the transversus pedis travelling forwards so as to assume its transverse position upon the heads of the metatarsals. The flexor brevis minimi digiti is recog- nised from its lying in relation to the fifth metatarsal bone. Plantar Arch—Deep Division of External Plan- tar Nerve.—The playitar arch is that portion of the external plantar artery which extends from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone to the posterior part of the first interosseous space. The deep division of the external plantar nerve which accompanies it must be dissected at the same time. The nerve will be observed to end in the substance of the adductor hallucis. Detach this muscle from its origin and throw it for- wards. The transversus pedis, the interossei muscles with the exception of those in the fourth space and the two outer lumbrical muscles also receive twigs from

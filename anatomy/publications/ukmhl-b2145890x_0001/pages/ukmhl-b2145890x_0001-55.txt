PALM OF THE HAND. the superficialis voice may be traced downwards through some of the muscular fibres of the ball of the thumb to join the terminal branch of the ulnar, and thus complete the arterial arcade. The branches which it gives off are—(i.) The profunda, which sinks from view with the nerve of the same name between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti; (2.) Four digital arteries from the convexity of the arch ta supply both sides of each of the three inner fingers and the ulnar side of the index ; (3.) Minute recurrent tzvigs from the concavity. Nerves.—The nerves next claim the attention of the student; and, in the first place, he must note how they enter the palm. The ulnar passes superficial to the anterior annular ligament; the median reaches the palm by passing under cover of that ligament.. Trace each nei-ve to its distribution. The ulnar soon divides into a superficial and a deep division. The deep division accompanies the profunda artery. The superficial division supplies a twig to the palmaris I brevis, and ends by dividing into the palmar collateral branches for the little finger and the ulnar margin of. the ring finger. The muscidar branches of the median are especially liable to injury, and must therefore be sought for carefully. That to the outer head of the flexor brevis poUicis, the opponens poUicis, and abductor pollicis comes ofT almost on a line with the lower margin of the anterior annular ligament. The twigs to the two outer lumbricals spring, the one from the digital nerve . to the radial side of the index.

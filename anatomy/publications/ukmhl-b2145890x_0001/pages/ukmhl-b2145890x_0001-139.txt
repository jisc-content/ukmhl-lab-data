SOLE OF THE FOOT. 127 (11.) Arteria magna hallucis. (12.) Tendons of peroneus longus and tibialis posticus. (13.) Interossei muscles. The limb should be placed upon the table, with the sole of the foot facing the dissector, and the ankle supported by a good-sized block. Reflection of Skin.—Two incisions are required— (i.) A longitudinal incision along the middle line of the sole, from the heel to the root of the middle toe. (2.) A transverse cut, at the digital extremity of the mesial incision, across the sole at the roots of the toes. Superficial Fascia and Cutaneous Nerves.— When the two flaps of skin which are traced out by the above incisions are reflected, the peculiar char- acters of the superficial faScia will come under the notice of the student. He will observe that it is tough and granular, and that it, in many respects, resembles the superficial fascia which covers the tuber ischii. Traversing it are tough fibrous bands, which subdivide the fatty tissue into granular lobules and connect the thick skin of the sole with the plantar fascia. The internal calcanear nerve, which has already been found piercing the internal annular ligament, should be traced to its distribution. It supplies the skin of the sole in the neighbourhood of the heel. The superficial fascia may now be removed. Divide it along the middle line of the sole, and turn it out- wards and inwards, cleaning at the same time the deep fascia. As the dissector approaches the outer and inner margins of the foot respectively, some minute

73 BACK OF THE THIGH. the small sciatic may be discovered ; (2.) Towards tJie outer side of the thigh some twigs from the external cutaneotLS nerve may be detected ; (3.) Lastly, towards the inner aspect of the Hmb endeavour to find some offsets from the ifiternal cutaneous nerve. Deep Fascia.—On removing the superficial fascia the deep fascia will be observed to be exceedingly thin. It must now be turned aside, and in doing this be careful of the trunk of the small sciatic nerve, which passes down in the middle line of the limb immediately subjacent to the fascia. Hamstring Muscles.—The biceps is recognised from its diverging to form the outer and upper bound- ary of the popliteal space. The semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend downwards on the inner side of the thigh on its posterior aspect, and the former on the superficial aspect of the latter. In cleaning these muscles the dissector should proceed cautiously to work, otherwise he is certain to injure the arterial and nervous twigs which enter them. Observe the manner in which they arise from the tuber ischii; how the con- joined tendon of the long head of the biceps and the semitendinosus lies superficial and internal to that ' of the semimembranosus. Define the precise attach- ment which the short head of the biceps has to the ' femur, and note the tendinous intersection of the semi- I tendinosus and the tendinous expansion upon both j superficial and deep aspects of the semimembranosus. Great Sciatic Nerve.—Follow this nerve down- ' wards to its division into the internal and external I

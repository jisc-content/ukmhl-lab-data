ABDOMEN. 2 time allotted for this important dissection is somewhat limited, but it must be borne in mind that the litho- tomy posture admits of no other dissection being done, and consequently the other dissectors are unable to begin work until the position of the body is changed. MALE PERINEUM. To prepare the part for dissection, a staff should first be introduced into the bladder. The rectum should then be moderately distended with tow, and the orifice of the anus stitched up. In passing the staff into the bladder, the dissector must stand upon the left side of the subject. Having smeared the instrument with oil, hold it lightly in the right hand and guide it gently along the upper and right wall of the urethra. When the point of the instrument reaches the triangular ligament—a strong aponeurotic structure which is stretched tightly across the pubic arch—depress the handle, but use no force. Should any difficulty be experienced, introduce the forefinger of the left hand into the rectum to guide the point of the instrument along the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra. The most depend- ent part of the scrotum should now be stitched to the prepuce of the penis, and dragging both penis and scrotum forwards upon the staff, they should be fixed by means of the twine to its handle. Lastly, fasten the handle of the staff to the cord which passes behind the flexed knee-joints of the subject. Boundaries of the Perineum.—The perineal space

ABDOMINAL WALL. 65 pubic bone. The margins of the aperture are termed the pillars of the ring. The internal or superior pillar is flat and broad, and is attached to the symphysis pubis. Some of its fibres cross the middle Hne, decussate with the corresponding fibres of the other side, and are inserted into the front of the opposite pubic bone. The external or inferior pillar is simply the inner end of Poupart's ligament. It is, therefore, thick and strong, and is fixed to the pubic spine. The spermatic cord, as it issues from the external abdominal ring, rests upon the external pillar. The size of the external abdominal ring is very variable. In the male the average length may be said to be one inch or one inch and a-half, and the breadth about half-an-inch. In the female it is much smaller. In the female the round ligament of the uterus will be found to end in the superficial fascia of the groin. On a close inspection of the lower part of the ex- ternal abdominal aponeurosis, the student will observe a number of cross fibres. These are called the inter- columnar fibres, and in some cases they are very strongly marked. They begin at Poupart's ligament close to the iliac spine, and arch upwards and inwards above the external abdominal ring. The function of these fibres is very evident, and the term " inter- columnar " is derived from the part which they play. They bind together the two pillars of the ring, and prevent their further separation or divarication. There is a direct continuity between the intercolumnar fibres and the external spermatic fascia which clothes the PART II. p

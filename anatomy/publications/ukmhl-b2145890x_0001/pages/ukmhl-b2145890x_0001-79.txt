POPLITEAL SPACE. 67 the external saphenous vein. This vessel ascends in the middle line of the leg, and tracing it upwards it will be found to disappear from view by piercing the deep fascia, and entering the popliteal space. The terminal branch of the small sciatic nerve pierces the popliteal fascia at the lower part of the space, and here it will be seen lying close to the external saphenous vein. Popliteal Fascia.—Great care must be taken in removing the superficial fascia from the deep popliteal fascia. Although thin, the deep fascia possesses ^ considerable strength, owing to the transverse fibres which are interwoven amidst its proper aponeurotic fibres. In removing this fascia the dissector will notice that it is firmly attached on each side to the tendons of the muscles which bound the popliteal 5pace. Boundaries.—The structures which roof in the popliteal space being now removed, the dissector must in the next place proceed to define the boundaries. The space will now be seen to be diamond-shaped. Above, and to the outside, will be found the biceps muscle ; whilst above, and to the inside, the semitend- inosus and semimembranosus will be broueht into view—the former lying upon the surface of the latter. In front of these the sartorius, gracilis and the tendon of the adductor magnus can be exposed. Below, the space is bounded by the converging heads of the gastrocnemius. In the formation of the lower and outer boundary, the outer head of the gastrocnemius

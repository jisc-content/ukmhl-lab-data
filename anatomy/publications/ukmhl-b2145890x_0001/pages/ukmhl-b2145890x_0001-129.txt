POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. II7 (5.) Tendo-Achillis and its bursa. (6.) Posterior tibial vessels. (7.) Posterior tibial nerve. {Popliteus. Flexor longus hallucis. Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus digitorum. (9.) Internal annular ligament. Reflection of Skin.—Incisions.—(i.) A longitu- dinal incision along the middle line of the leg on its posterior aspect to the extremity of the heel. (2.) A transverse incision at the lower end of this, extending along the inner and outer margins of the foot for about two inches on either side. The two flaps of skin thus marked out must be raised and turned outwards and inwards. Superficial Veins.—The internal and external saphe- nous veins must be looked for in the substance of the fatty superficial fascia. Both of these vessels have been seen in previous steps of the dissection. The internal saphenous vein has been observed to arise from the inner extremity of the venous arch on the dorsum of the foot, and it has been traced upwards for a short distance in front of the inner malleolus and inner aspect of the tibia. It has also been dissected out upon the inner aspect of the thigh and knee. It can now be exposed in its course along the inner side of the leg. The external saphenous vein has been seen to arise from the outer end of the dorsal arch and to pass upwards behind the outer malleolus. It has also been noticed m the dissection of the popliteal space joining the

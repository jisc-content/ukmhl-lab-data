PELVIC BLOOD-VESSELS. 263 sciatic foramen, and appears in the gluteal region in the interval between the pyriformis and gluteus mini- mus muscles. The lateral sacral is usually represented by two arteries, which extend downwards upon the pyri- formis muscle and sacral nerves, external to the anterior sacral foramina and the sympathetic cord. They furnish twigs to the parts upon which they lie, and branches which enter the sacral foramina. The latter, after supplying the membranes and nerve-roots within the sacral canal, emerge behind, through the posterior sacral foramina, and there anastomose with branches of the gluteal artery. The lower of the two lateral sacral arteries inosculates inferiorly with the middle sacral. The Superior Haemorrhoidal Artery—This is the continuation into the pelvis of the inferior mesenteric artery. It descends behind the rectum, between the two layers of its mesentery, and soon divides into two branches which extend downwards, one upon each side of the gut. Near the end of the second part of the rectum these branches break up into numerous twigs, which surround the intestine. Approaching its external orifice, they pierce the muscular coat and continue downwards, subjacent to the mucous mem- brane, and at the anus they end by a series of anastomosing loops. The superior haemorrhoidal anastomoses freely with both the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal arteries. Middle Sacral Artery.—The middle sacral has

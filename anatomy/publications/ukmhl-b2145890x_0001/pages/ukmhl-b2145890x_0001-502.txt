The serous coat has already been examined. It is complete in the first part of the rectum, partial in the second part, and altogether absent from the third part. The subserous coat is the loose flocculent areolar tissue which intervenes between the peritoneum and the muscular coat. In its lower part the rectum derives a sheath from the rectal layer of pelvic fascia. The muscular coat is composed of two strata of involuntary nonstriated muscular fibres—viz., an external longitudinal and an internal circular layer. The longitudinal fibres are continuous above with the three longitudinal bands of the colon, but here they are spread out uniformly so as to form a continuous covering for the gut; they will be observed to terminate near the anus. The circular fibres extend transversely around the gut, and near the anus they are collected into a distinct circular band which surrounds the orifice and is termed the sphincter ani internus. The submucous coat differs in no respect from the same coat in the colon. To see the mucous membrane it is necessary to slit open the rectum along its anterior wall. The mucous membrane is somewhat thicker than that of the colon, and is more freely moveable upon the muscular tunic. In consequence of this mobility, it is thrown into irregular folds or rug^ when the

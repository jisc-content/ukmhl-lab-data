84 LOWER LIMB. band thus formed goes under the name of the ilio- tibial baizd, from its being attached above to the crest of the ihum, and below to the outer tuberosity of the tibia. Internally, the fascia lata is so exceedingly delicate and thin that the subjacent muscular fibres shine through it, and it is very apt to be removed with the superficial fascia unless care be exercised in the dissection. Patellar Bursa.—This is situated upon the super- ficial aspect of the patella. Pinch up the fascia lata as it passes over this bone with the forceps, and make a transverse incision through the wall of the sac, large enough to admit the finger. It will then be seen to extend downwards for a short distance upon the ligamentum patellae. It is usually intersected by fibrous bands and cords. DEEP DISSECTION.

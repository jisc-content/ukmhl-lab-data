These are all held together by loose areolar tissue, which intervenes between them, and also by the investments which are given to the cord by the abdominal wall. TAe cremasteric artery is a branch of the deep epigastric, and has already been seen entering the cremaster muscle. The genital branch of the genito- crural nerve has a similar destination. It has also been displayed in a previous stage of the dissection. The spermatic artery arises within the abdomen from the front of the aorta, and entering the cord at the internal abdominal ring, it proceeds to the testicle, into the posterior border of which it sinks, after dividing into several smaller twigs. The sper7natic veins issue from the testicle at its posterior border, and as they pass upwards they form in the cord a bulky plexus, which is termed the spermatic plexus. A single vessel issues from this, which enters the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring. On the right side it pours Its blood into the inferior vena cava; on the left side It joms the left renal vein. The vas deferens, the duct of the testicle, can always PART II. ^ ^

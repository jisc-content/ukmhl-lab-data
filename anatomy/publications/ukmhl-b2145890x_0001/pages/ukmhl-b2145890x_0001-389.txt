CCELIAC AXIS. 163 The Coronary Vein accompanies the artery of the same name along the lesser curvature of the stomach. At the pylorus it turns downwards and opens into the vena portae. The Hepatic Artery, intermediate in size between the coronary and splenic, at first takes a transverse course to the right. At the pyloric end of the stomach it changes its direction, and ascends between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum, inclining at the same time forwards and to the right side. Near the transverse fissure of the liver it ends by dividing into right and left hepatic arteries. The hepatic arteiy is accompanied by numerous large nervous twigs derived from the coeliac plexus, and, as it passes upwards to the liver, it is in close relationship with the bile duct and the portal vein. The duct lies upon the right side of the artery, and the vein lies behind and between both <Figs. 22 and 28.) The following are the branches of the hepatic artery:â€” (i.) Pyloric. (2.) Gastro-duodenal. | Superior pancreatico-duodenal. \ Right gastro-epiploic. <3.) Hepatic. / Rig^t.{ Cystic. 1 Left. pyloric is a small artery which springs from the . nepatic at the pylorus, and then runs from right to left I along the lesser curvature of the stomach between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. It ends by I inosculatmg with the coronary.

30 ABDOMEN. already been seen to give off the inferior hcemorrhoidal, the superficial perineal, and the transverse perineal arteries, and to divide into its two terminal branches— the dorsal artery of the penis and the artery to the corpus cavernosum. Between the layers of the triangular liga- ment it gives origin to the artery to the bulb. The artery to the bidb is a short wide vessel which springs from the pudic about a quarter of an inch above the level of the base of the triangular ligament. It passes transversely inwards between the two layers of this ligament, and, giving a small twig to Cowper's crland it enters the substance of the bulb. It supplies the bulb and corpus spongiosum with blood; some branches also are sent to the glans penis. The artery to the corpus cavernosum pierces the crus penis, and is carried forward in the substance of the corpus cavernosum, which it suplies with blood. The dorsal artery of the penis runs forward in the interval between the crura penis, and, passing between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, gains the dorsum of the penis, where it will be afterwards traced. The Pudic Nerve.—The pudic nerve is a branch of the sacral plexus. It has very much the same relations as the pudic artery. In the rectal triangle it is con- tained within the same sheath, in which it occupies the lowest level. After giving off the inferior hemor- rhoidal nerve, it divides into two terminal divisions— viz. (I.) the perineal nerve, and (2.) the dorsal nerve of the penis.

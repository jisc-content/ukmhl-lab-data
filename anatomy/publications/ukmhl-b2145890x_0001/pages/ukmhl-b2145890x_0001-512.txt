A transverse section through the spongy portion, except at its anterior part, would give the appearance of a transverse slit. In the fossa navicularis, however, the slit becomes vertical. Mucous Membrane of the Urethra.—The mu- cous lining of the urethra is continuous posteriorly with that of the bladder, and anteriorly with the integu- ment covering the glans penis. It is likewise con- tinuous with the mucous membrane which lines the various ducts which open into the urethra. It is every- where studded with the mouths of minute recesses, called lacuncB. These are particularly plentiful on the floor of the spongy part, and, as a general rule, they are directed forwards towards the meatus urinarius. One recess, specially deserving the attention of the student on account of its large size, is called the lacuna magna; and is usually placed on the roof of the fossa navicularis. Its orifice in rare cases is large enough to admit the point of a small bougie or catheter. Direction of the Urethral Canal.—The pros- tatic portion is directed downwards and slightly for- wards ; the membranous part describes a slight curve behind the symphysis, the concavity of which looks forwards ; whilst the spongy part at first ascends, and

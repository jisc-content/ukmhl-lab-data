150 ABDOMEN. be followed to their distribution. The ureter and the inferior mesenteric vein will be seen lying upon the psoas. The inferior mesenteric artery, considerably smaller than the superior mesenteric, springs from the left side of the abdominal aorta, about an inch and a-half above its bifurcation into the two common iliacs, and descends with a slight inclination to the left, towards the left iliac fossa. At first it is applied to the left side of the aorta, to which it is bound by peritoneum; it then crosses the left common iliac artery and enters the pelvis, where it receives the name of superior hceniorrhoidal Before leaving the abdomen proper it gives off two branchesâ€”viz., the left colic and the sigmoid. The left colic artery proceeds to the left, over the left kidney, and divides into two branches, of which one ascends to inosculate with the middle colic, whilst the other descends to unite with the sigmoid. From the arches thus formed twigs are supplied to the colon. The sigmoid artery runs almost horizontally across the psoas muscle to the left iliac fossa, where it breaks up into branches for the supply of the sigmoid flexure. It inosculates above with the left colic, and below with the superior hemorrhoidal. In place of one, there are frequently several sigmoid arteries. The superior hcemorrhoidal artery will be followed out in the dissection of the pelvis. The Inferior Mesenteric Vein receives tributaries corresponding with the branches of the inferior

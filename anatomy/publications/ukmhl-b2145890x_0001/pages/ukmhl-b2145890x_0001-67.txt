GLUTEAL REGION. 55 as the corresponding layer of fascia in other parts of the body. Notice, however, its special peculiarities in this region. How it is much more heavily laden with fat—especially in the female; how it thickens over the lower margin of the gluteus maximus, and how it becomes tough, elastic, and stringy over the ischial tuberosity, so as to form a most effective cushion upon which this bony prominence may rest while the body is in the sitting posture. Cutaneous Nerves.—The superficial fascia forms a bed in which the cutaneous nerves ramify before they enter the skin. In this region the cutaneous nerves are very numerous, . and they are derived from a great variety of sources. Some proceed from the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves, whilst others are branches of the anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves. From the posterior primary divisions there are usually six—tJiree from the sacral nerves, and three from the lumbar nerves. The three sacral nerves reach the surface by piercing the gluteus maximus muscle close to its origin from the sacrum and coccyx. They pierce the muscle in a line drawn from the posterior superior iliac spine to the tip of the coccyx. The largest is found opposite the lowest piece of the sacrum, the highest about an inch above this, and the lowest about the same distance below it. Owing to the coarseness of the muscular fasciculi between which they appear, they are somewhat difficult to find. In looking for them it is best to cut right down through

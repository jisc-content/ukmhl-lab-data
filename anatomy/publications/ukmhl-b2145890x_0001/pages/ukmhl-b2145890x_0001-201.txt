POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 189 major; whilst on the left side are the pleura and the thoracic aorta, except in its lower part, where the oesophagus lies in front of the vessel. Lastly, bear in mind that the pneumogastric nerves form the plexus gulae upon its walls. The Thoracic Aorta.â€”The thoracic aorta is the direct continuation of the aortic arch. It begins at the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra, and ends opposite the last dorsal vertebra by entering the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and becoming the abdominal aorta. At its commence- ment it lies somewhat to the left of the middle line, but as it proceeds downwards it inclines inwards, so that at its termination it is mesial in position. It lies upon the bodies of the vertebrae, and therefore it shows a curve corresponding to that of the vertebral column in the dorsal region. In front, it is covered by the pericardium, and is crossed by the root of the left lung. Behind, it rests upon the vertebral bodies and the intervening intervertebral discs, whilst crossing behind it the dissector will observe the vena azygos minor inferior, and, in many cases, the vena azygos minor superior. To the left side, and closely applied to the vessel, is that part of the pleura which forms the left lateral wall of the posterior mediastinum ; whilst on its right side will be noticed the thoracic duct and the vena azygos major. The oesophagus has a varying and important relationship to the thoracic aorta. At first it lies to the right of the aorta, but as it approaches the

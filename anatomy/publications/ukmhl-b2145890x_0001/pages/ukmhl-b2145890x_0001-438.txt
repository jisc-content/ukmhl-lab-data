Deep Lymphatic Glands.—The dissector has, doubtless, noticed a chain of lymphatic glands in con- nection with the external iliac artery, the common iliac artery, and also extending upwards upon the vertebral column in relation to the aorta and vena cava. The external iliac glands receive the efferent vessels which proceed from the inguinal glands. As we proceed upwards, the vessels which connect the various glands become greatly diminished in number but much increased in calibre, until at last they resolve themselves into four or five large lymphatic trunks, which join the lower part of the receptaculum chyli. Receptaculum Ohyli.-This is the dilated com- mencement of the thoracic duct. It is placed upon the body of the second lumbar vertebra, in the inter- val between the right crus of the diaphragm and the aorta. To bring it into view, it may be necessaiy to separate the right crus from the lumbar vertebrae and pull it aside. When fully displayed, the receptaculum chyli is seen to be a narrow elongated sac about an inch in length, which receives by its lower end several large lymphatic vessels, whilst superiorly, it contracts and becomes the thoracic duct. At its upper end it is joined anteriorly by the lacteal vessels. The vena azygos major lies along its right side, but the recep- taculum chyli is easily distinguished from this by the ■whiteness of its walls. The thoracic duct enters the

129 SOLE OF THE FOOT. tendons and become fixed to the flexor sheaths and to the lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The lateral parts of the plantar fascia are weak in comparison with the central portion. They simply constitute an aponeurotic covering for the muscles, which lie subjacent. A strong band is to be noted in connection with the outer part. It stretches be- tween the prominence formed by the base of the fifth metatarsal bone and the external tuberosity of the OS calcis. In connection with the plantar fascia two inter- muscular septa have also to be studied. These pass upwards into the sole, along the line of the longitudinal furrows which mark off the central portion of the fascia from the lateral parts. They consequently lie one upon each side of the flexor brevis digitorum, and form partitions which separate it from the abductor hallucis on the one hand, and the abductor minimi digiti on the other. To demonstrate these septa, make a trans- verse incision through the central portion of the plantar fascia about an inch in front of the internal tuberosity of the os calcis, and also a longitudinal cut through the same piece of fascia, extending from the first incision along the middle line of the foot. Now raise the divided fascia and throw it outwards and inwards. Some difficulty will be experienced in effect- ing this, owing to its affording a surface of origin in Its upper part to the subjacent flexor brevis digitorum. As we approach the margins of this muscle the septa are brought into view. K

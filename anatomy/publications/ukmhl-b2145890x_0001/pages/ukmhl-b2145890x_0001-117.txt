ANTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 105 the leg in its upper part. The external saphenous nerve can be readily found. It reaches the outer margin of the foot by passing behind the external malleolus in company with the vein of the same name. Trace it forwards, and it will be found to end upon the fibular side of the little toe. The internal saphenous nerve should be looked for in front of the inner maleolus. It descends in company with the internal saphenous vein. It can with care be followed half-way along the inner margin of the foot, but here it ends. Above the ankle-joint several minute twigs from this nerve may be found passing forwards to reach the front of the leg. The cutaneous portion of the musculo-mtaneous nerve appears in the lower third of the leg. It pierces the deep fascia a short way to the outside of the middle line of the limb. On following it downwards it will be observed to split into an inner and an outer pai^t. The inner division should be traced out first. It goes to the tibial side of the great toe. It gives a number of twigs to the skin upon the inner margin of the foot and effects a junction with the anterior tibial and internal saphenous nerves. The outer part will be noticed to divide into a number of branches, and on following these forward they will be found to supply twigs to the fibular side of the second toe, both sides of the third and fourth toes, and the tibial side of the fifth toe. The anterior tibial pierces the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot in the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones. It ends by dividing

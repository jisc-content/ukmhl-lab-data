41 FEMALE PERINEUM. Note further that the anterior lip is the longer of the two, whilst the posterior lip is the thicker. The rectum should now be moderately filled with tow, and the vulval and anal orifices stitched up. Reflection of Skin.—Incisions.—(i.) A transverse incision should, in the first place, be carried from one ischial tuberosity to the other, in front of the anus ; (2.) The uro-genital fissure and the orifice of the anus should next be closely encircled by incisions, and these joined by a cut along the middle line. (3.) Lastly, carry an incision forwards from the second or third piece of the coccyx along the middle line to the cut which surrounds the anus. Four flaps are thus marked out; the two anterior may be thrown forwards and outwards, and the two posterior backwards and outwards. Superficial Fascia.—The superficial fascia of the perineum is now laid bare. In the rectal triangle it agrees in every particular with the same portion of fascia in the male. In the anterior or urethral triangle, however, owing to the difference in the external organs of generation, there is a slight modification. It has- the same attachments—viz., to the anterior lips of the pubic arch, and to the base of the triangular ligament, but it is not so membranaceous, and consequently does not form so distinct a layer. The two fascial pouches are also present in the female, and are some- times spoken of as the vulvo-scrotalsacs. Their separa- tion along the middle line is not due to the interposition

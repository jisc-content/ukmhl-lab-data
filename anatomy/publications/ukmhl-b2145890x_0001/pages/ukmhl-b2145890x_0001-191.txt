THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. 179 the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side, it changes its direction, passes transversely to the left, and recedes from the surface so as to gain the lower border of the left side of the fourtJi dorsal vertebra. It now bends downwards, and at the lower border of the body of the fiftJi dorsal vertebra it be- comes continuous with the descending thoracic aorta. TJie ascending poi'tion of the aortic arch is enclosed within the fibrous pericardium, whilst the same sheath of serous pericardium surrounds it and the pulmonary artery. At its origin it lies under cover of the pul- monary artery, but higher up this vessel is placed to the left of the ascending aorta. To its right side is the superior vena cava, whilst behind, it is in relation to the bronchus and pulmonary vessels of the right side. The coronary arteries have already been seen to take origin from this portion of the aorta. The transverse part of the aortic arch lies under cover of the left pleura, towards the left side of the body. It is also overlapped by the left lung, and crossed superficially by (^.) the left phrenic nerve, {b) the left pneumogastric nerve, and (^.) between these by the two cardiac nei-ves which enter into the formation of the superficial cardiac plexus. In relation to its upper surface is the left vena innominata, and from this aspect of the vessel three large arteries take originâ€” viz., from right to left the innominate artery, {b) the left common carotid artery, {c) the left subclavian artery. Its lower surface is in relation to the bifurca- tion of the pulmonary artery, and is connected with the root of the left pulmonary artery by the fibrous

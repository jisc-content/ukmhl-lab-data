MALE PERINEUM. arch. As it proceeds forwards it inclines inwards, and, piercing the attachment of the superficial fascia to the margin of the pubic arch, it accompanies the other vessels and nerves to the scrotum, the outer and front part of which it supplies. Instead of searching for this nerve at the point where it be- comes superficial, and then following it towards its distribution, it is much easier to find it after it has entered the perineal pouch of fascia. Here it will be discovered lying in close relation to the two preceding nerves, but to their outer side. Trace it forwards and backwards. The long pudendal com- municates with the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve, and also with the posterior superficial perineal nerve. Divide the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, and throw them aside. Root of the Penis.â€”At this stage of the dissection the student should consider the position of the triangular ligament, and the relation which it bears to the root of the penis. The triangular ligament is a strong aponeurotic membrane which stretches across the pubic arch, and subdivides the urethral portion of the perineum into a superficial and a deep area. The root of the penis is placed altogether in front of it, in the superficial area of this region. With the handle of the knife clear away for a short distance the loose tissue which surrounds the body of the penis. The body of the pe?iis is then seen to consist of three cylindrical masses placed in close apposition with each PART II. r

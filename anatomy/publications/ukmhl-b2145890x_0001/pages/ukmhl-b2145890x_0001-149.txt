SOLE OF THE FOOT. (c.) three posterior perforating branches from the upper surface of the arch. The digital arteries supply both sides of the three outer toes and the fibular side of the second toe. The posterior perforating arteries pass upwards to the dor- sum of the foot through the back part of the three outer intermetatarsal spaces. Arteria Magna Hallucis. — This artery arises from the dorsalis pedis as it lies between "the first and second metatarsal bones. On dissecting its branches it will be seen to supply the adjacent sides of the hallux and second toe, and also to send a branch to the tibial side of the hallux. Fourth Layer of Muscles.—A satisfactory dis- play of the interossei muscles cannot be obtained unless the transverse metatarsal ligament be divided between the heads of the metatarsal bones. The toes can now be separated more freely from each other, and the in- terossei muscles traced to their insertions. It is well also to reflect at this stage the flexor brevis minimi digiti. The plantar interossei are three in number, and are so placed that they adduct the three outer toes towards a line drawn through the second toe. They lie upon the plantar aspect of the three outer metatarsal bones, and are inserted one upon the tibial side of each of the toes which correspond to these metatarsals. The dorsal interossei are four in number. They occupy the four intermetatarsal spaces, and consequently they must be dissected both upon the plantar and dorsal

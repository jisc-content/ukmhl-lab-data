THORAX. numerous twigs to the left auricle and left ventricle, and a large branch will be observed to pass down- wards in the anterior interventricular groove. The right coronary artery arises from the right anterior sinus of Valsalva, and winds round the right margin of the heart in the auriculo-ventricular groove to reach its posterior aspect, where it ends by inoscu- lating with the artery of the left side. An arterial circle is thus formed, which embraces the base of the heart. The right coronary artery gives off two large branches Of these one passes downwards upon the right sharp margin of the heart, whilst the other descends towards the apex in the posterior interven- tricular groove. It also supplies numerous smaller twigs to the right side of the heart. Accompanying each of these arteries are mmute nerves from the cardiac plexus. Cardiac Veins.-Take hold of the heart by the apex and pull it upwards, so as to bring into view its posterior surface. In the groove between the left ventricle and left auricle, you will notice the coronary short wide venous channel (Fig. n a, p. I74)- Open it with the scissors along its whole length. By one extremity it opens into the right auricle, whilst by its other end it becomes continuous with the great card^ac vein (Fig. n ^, P- I74), and the point of iunction is marked by a valve of two segments. Several posterior cardiac veins from the posterior aspect of the ventricles also open into this sinus and each orifice is guarded by a distinct valve. Of these one is much larger than the others, and ascends

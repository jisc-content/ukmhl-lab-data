FEMALE PERINEUM. 47 and united along the middle line; and (3.) two crura attached to the sides of the pubic arch. We have seen that the pars intermedia corresponds with the corpus spongiosum in the male. This apparatus in the female, therefore, closely resembles the penis in man, the chief differences being the diminutive size of the clitoris, and the fact that the glans clitoridis is not perforated by the urethra. The Triangular Ligament.—Detach the crura clitoridis from the sides of the pubic arch and throw them aside. This dissection requires care, because the pudic arteries, the dorsal nerves of the clitoris, and the small arteries which enter the crura are very apt to be injured. The pudic vessels and the dorsal nerve will be seen piercing the triangular ligament about half-an-inch below the symphysis pubis and a little way external to the middle line. A good view is now obtained of the triangular ligament. Owing to the greater width of the pubic arch, it is a more extensive membrane than in the male. It does not possess the same strength, however, and is not so perfect, seeing that it is pierced by the vaginal canal. Its attachments are precisely the same —-1.6., (i.) by its apex to the subpubic ligament; (2.) by its base to the superficial fascia and the central point of the perineum ; and (3.) by its sides to the margins of the pubic arch. In the middle line, and from above downwards, it is pierced—(i.) about half-an-inch below the symphysis pubis by the dorsal vein of the clitoris; (2.) fully an

THORAX. slender muscular fasciculi, which are difficult to isolate from the areolar tissue in which they lie. Pneumogastric Nerves.—The pneumogastric nerves can now be followed throughout their entire course within the thorax. They differ so much in their relations on the two sides of the body that it is best to examine each separately. The left prmunogastric nerve enters the thorax in the interval between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, and behind the left innominate vein. It has already been obsei-ved crossing the arch of the aorta upon the left side of the phrenic nerve and the two superficial cardiac nerves. Here also it has been seen to give off its recurrent laryngeal branch. Leaving the aorta, it sinks behind the root of the left lung, and at once breaks up into a number of branches, which unite in a plexiform manner to form the left posterior pulmonary plexus. It issues from this plexus in the form of one or two nervous cords, which pass to the anterior aspect of the oesophagus. Upon the oesopha- gus another plexus—the plexus gulce—is formed ; but this plexus differs from the pulmonic plexus, inasmuch as the pneumogastric nerves of both sides take part in its formation. From the plexus gulas the left pneumo- gastric emerges as one nervous cord, and passes out of the thorax by the oesophageal opening of the dia- phragm. It is distributed within the abdomen upon the anterior surface of the stomach. The right pneumogastric nerve lies deeper in the thorax than the left nerve. It enters by passing be-

ABDOMEN. 28o about the same distance from the luette or urethral orifice. Trigone of the Bladder.—The three orifices of the bladder constitute the angles of an equilateral tri- anele which is termed the trigone, the boundaries of which are formed by lines drawn between the open- ings of the ureters and from each of these forwards to the luette. The mucous membrane over this area presents a marked contrast to the same membrane in other parts of the bladder. Here it is always smooth, in whatever condition the viscus may be, and this is due to its being tightly bound down to the subjacent muscular coat. Again, it is more highly vascular, and has a more abundant supply of nerves. It is from the pressure of the urine against this highly sensitive portion of mucous membrane that the feeling which points to a necessity for micturition proceeds. It is important to note that the trigone in the interior of the bladder corresponds with the triangular area on the exterior of the base, which is bounded by the vasa deferentia, the vesiculae seminales, and the reflection of the recto-vesical peritoneal cul-de-sac. Urethra.—The urethra is the canal through which the urine, the semen, and the secretions of the vesi- culse seminales, the prostate, and Cowper's glands are emitted from the body. It commences at the neck of the bladder and ends on the glans penis, and its aver- age length is somewhere about eight or nine inches. It is customary to divide the urethra into three parts from the different character of the structures which it

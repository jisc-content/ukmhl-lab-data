ABDOMINAL "WALL. 85 versalis muscles, which, at this point, do not descend so low as Poupart's ligament. In this interval the transversalis fascia has a most important relation to the spermatic cord. Here the fascia is pierced by the cord, but as yet no opening is visible. Take hold of the cord and draw it downwards and inwards. The margins of the aperture through which it passes will be observed to be prolonged downwards upon the cord in a funnel-shaped manner, so as to invest it upon all sides with a tube of fascia. This invest- ment, which is thus seen to come directly from the fascia transversalis, is called the infimdibuliforin or internal spermatic fascia. It must now become the object of the student to demonstrate the more important attachments of this fascia. For this purpose divide the fibres of the transversalis muscle close to Poupart's ligament and the crest of the ilium, and raising the muscle from the subjacent fascia, throw it upwards. It is not neces- sary to reflect the entire muscle. When the fascia is cleaned with the handle of the scalpel, it will be seen to be attached laterally to the inner lip of the iliac crest. Along the line of this attachment, which is by no means firm, it becomes continuous with the fascia iliaca~t\i^.t portion of the same fascial stratum which covers the iliacus and psoas muscles in the iliac fossa. Close to the crest of the ilium the fascia transversalis is pierced first by the ascending branch and then by the terminal branches of the deep circumflex iliac artery. In front, in the inguinal region, its connections are more complicated, and must be studied at three

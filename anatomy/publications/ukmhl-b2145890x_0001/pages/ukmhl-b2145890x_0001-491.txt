PELVIC DIAPHRAGM. 265 subjacent to the mucous membrane. From this the blood is drained away by three different veins—viz., the inferior hsemorrhoidal, which carries it to the pudic vein; the middle haemorrhoidal, which leads it to the internal iliac vein ; and the superior haemor- rhoidal vein, which is one of the rootlets of the portal vein. The haemorrhoidal plexus may therefore be regarded as being the link between the systemic and portal system of veins. This has an important bearing upon the production of haemorrhoids, which consist in a varicose condition of the inferior haemor- rhoidal veins. As we have seen, the portal vein and its tributaries are devoid of valves; consequently, anything retarding the flow of blood through the portal system will react upon the hemorrhoidal plexus, cause its distention, and predispose to haemorrhoids. The internal pudic vein proceeds upwards behind the artery of the same name, and joins the common iliac vein. With the exception of the ilio-lumbar and lateral sacral veins, it receives tributaries correspond- ing to the branches of the artery. Pelvic Diaphragm. The diaphragm of the pelvis should next be examined. It is composed of two muscles upon each side—viz., the levator ani and the coccygeus. Draw .the viscera as' far as possible to the right and remove what remains of the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia upon the left side. This will expose the upper

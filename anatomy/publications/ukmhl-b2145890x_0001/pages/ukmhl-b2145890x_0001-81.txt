POPLITEAL SPACE. 69 Contents.—These must next be carefully dissected out and cleaned by the removal of the soft fat which surrounds them. Internal Popliteal Nerve.—This is the most super- -ficial structure in the popliteal space. It is readily found by slightly separating the adipose tissue in the middle line of the space. The nei^vus conimunicans tibialis^ which has been already secured, should now be followed upwards, and it will then be seen that it is a branch of the internal popliteal nerve. Follow the internal popliteal nerve downwards, and dissect out its various branches. The tJiree articular nerves which spring from it and accompany the two internal articular arteries and the azygos articular artery must be sought for with the greatest care. In addition to these, it supplies muscular branches to the gastroc- nemius, soleus, plantaris, and popliteus muscles. External Popliteal Nerve.—This nerve will be discovered lying along the inner side of the biceps. It leaves the space by following the tendon of this muscle, and then it occupies the interval between the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the biceps. In tracing the nerve downwards secure the branches which it gives off, viz.—(i.) The nervtis conimunicans Jibularis, which has already been noticed on its way downwards over the outer head of the gastrocnemius ; (2.) A few cutaneous twigs ; (3.) Tzvo articular nerves which accompany the two external articular arteries. Popliteal Artery and Vein.—These lie in very ■ close apposition—the vein superficial to the artery.

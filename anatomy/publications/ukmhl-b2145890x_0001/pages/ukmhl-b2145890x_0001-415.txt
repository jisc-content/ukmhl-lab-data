THE LIVER. exception of the lower end of the rectum), from the spleen, pancreas, and gall-bladder. As we have already seen, both artery and vein enter the liver at the transverse fissure, after dividing into right and left branches. Note particularly the relative position of the vein^ artery, and duct at the transverse fissure. The duct is placed in front, the vein behind, whilst the artery is intermediate in position. They and their branches are all enveloped in a common fibrous sheath called Glisson^s capsule. Trace them into the liver substance for a short distance. The portal vein branches like an artery, and, wherever it divides, there also will the hepatic artery and hepatic duct be found to divide. The branches of these three structures, therefore, traverse the liver substance in company, and Glisson's capsule is prolonged into the liver with them, and follows them in their ramifications. The student is now in a posi- tion to understand the meaning of the term "portal canal." It is employed to denote a channel in the liver substance lined by a prolongation of Glisson's cap- sule, and holding in its interior a branch of the portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery, and a branch of the hepatic duct. The hepatic veins which lead the blood out of the liver have an arrangement altogether different from the vessels which enter at the transverse fissure. They converge towards the posterior border of the organ, and cannot be said to have any course outside the liver, as they open directly into the vena cava inferior. The vena cava should be slit open, when

g(\ LOWER LIMB. Insinuate the handle of a knife under the main trunk so as to raise it above the level of the muscles between which it lies, and render it tense, and then follow the numerous branches into which it breaks up as far as the limits of the space will allow. The minute twig to the pectineus muscle must be looked for with espe- cial care. It passes inwards behind the femoral vessels and sinks into the superficial surface of the muscle. Floor.â€”The floor of Scarpa's triangle is peculiar because it slopes backwards both from the inner and outer boundary of the space. To the inner side of the femoral artery it is formed by the adductor longus and pectineus, and between these by a small portion of the adductor brevis; to the outer side of the artery are the psoas and iliacus. The adductor longus is placed at an oblique plane, the inner border being nearer the surface than the outer border; and thus it is that it not only forms the inner boundary of the triangle but also takes part in the formation of the floor. These muscles should be cleaned in so far as they stand in relation to Scarpa's triangle. The fascia lata may now be removed from the lower two-thirds of the thigh. This can best be effected by dividing it along the middle line of the limb and throwing it outwards and inwards. Preserve undis- turbed the thickened band of fascia which lies upon the outer aspect of the thigh, and in raising the inner part from the surface of the sartorius be careful of certain nerves which lie in close relation to the inner margin of the muscle.

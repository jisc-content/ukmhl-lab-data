300 ABDOMEN. pouch in the male. In front, it is bounded by the peritoneum clothing the vagina and uterus; behind, by the membrane investing the rectum ; whilst on each side it is limited by a semilunar fold, which proceeds forwards from the side of the rectum to the side of the uterus. Considerable importance is at- tached by the gynecologists to the fact that this pouch is slightly deeper on the left than upon the right side. The Utero-vesical Pouch is much shallower than the preceding. It is placed between the uterus and the bladder, and it is limited laterally by two slight folds, termed the utero-vesical folds, which pass between these viscera. False Ligaments of the Bladder and Uterus.— The false ligaments of the bladder 2.x^five in number, viz.—one superior, two lateral, and two posterior. The two posterior false ligaments of the bladder are the utero-vesical folds, which extend between the uterus and bladder, and limit the utero-vesical pouch laterally. The superior false ligament is that portion of the peritoneum which passes from the apex of the bladder on to the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is led away from the viscus by the urachus and the two impervious hypogastric arteries. The lateral false ligament is the term applied to the peritoneum as it passes from each side of the bladder to the wall of the pelvis and the iliac fossa. This reflection has been seen to take place along the line of the obliterated hypogastric artery.

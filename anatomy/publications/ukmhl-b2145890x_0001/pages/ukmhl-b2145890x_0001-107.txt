95 FRONT OF THE THIGH. :ternal intermuscular septum. Take hold of the lower ■cportion of the ilio-tibial band and draw it forcibly :Dutwards; at the same time push inwards the vastus eexternus muscle, and a strong fibrous septum will be loeen passing inwards from the fascia lata towards the ilinea aspera. This is the external intermuscular septum :of the thigh, a partition interposed between the vastus sxternus and the short head of the biceps. Follow it upwards and downwards with the finger. The fibres of the vastus externus are seen arising from it, but little difficulty will be experienced in making out its Fig. 6. Diagram to show how the thigh is subdivided into three compartments by its general J aponeurotic investment and the three intermuscular septa which pass inwards from i it to the linea aspera of the femur, a. Interna intermuscular septum ; c, external ! intermuscular septum ; b, the third septum which is interposed between the adductor Ir muscles and the flexor muscles, Each compartment contains its own group of muscles, jiand with each group a particular nerve is associated.—{After Professor Turner). cattachment to the linea aspera of the femur. Imme- tdiately above the external condyle of the femur it is ] pierced by the superior external articular vessels. The iinternal intermusciilar septum is interposed between ilthe adductors and the vastus internus, and should also I be examined. It is thin in comparison with the ji external septum. I i

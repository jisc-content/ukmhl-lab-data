FRONT OF THE THIGH. 85 (lo.) Tensor fascia femoris muscle. (ii.) Deep layer of the ilio-tibial band of fascia lata. (i2.) The external and internal intermuscular septa. (13.) Pectineus muscle. (14.) GraciHs muscle. (15.) Adductor brevis muscle. (t6.) Obturator nerve. (17.) Adductor magnus muscle. (18.) Obturator externus muscle. (19.) Obturator artery. Femoral Sheath.—The exposure of the femoral sheath is the next step in the dissection of the thigli. To attain this object the iliac portion of the fascia lata must be partially reflected. Divide the superior horn of the outer crescentic margin of the saphenous opening, and then carry the knife outwards along the lower border of Poupart's ligament, so as to sever the attachment of the fascia lata to this thickened band. This incision should extend to within an inch of the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The piece of fascia marked out by the incision above, and by the outer free margin of the saphenous opening internally, must be carefully raised from the subjacent femoral sheath and thrown downwards and outwards. On the removal of a little loose fat, the femoral sheath will be brought into view as it enters the thigh under Poupart's ligament. Isolate it carefully from adjacent and surrounding parts, by carrying the handle of the knife gently round it,—insinuating it first between the sheath and Pouparfs ligament, th^n between the sheath and Gimbernafs ligament, which lies internal to it, and lastly, between the sheath and the pubic portion of the

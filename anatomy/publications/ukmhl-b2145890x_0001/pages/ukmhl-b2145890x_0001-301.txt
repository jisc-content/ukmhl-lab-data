In point of fact, the lumbar fascia constitutes the posterior aponeurosis of this muscle. But the manner in which this fascia is attached to the vertebra requires further explanation. As it approaches the spine it splits into three layers or lamellae ; of these the posterior lamella is attached to the tips of the spinous processes, the anterior lamella to the bodies of the vertebrae at the

45 FEMALE PERINEUM. derived from the triangular ligament, upon the anterior surface of which they rest. Externally they present a rounded convex surface which is coated with the sphincter vaginae muscle, whilst internally each erectile mass rests upon the deep surface of the mucous membrane of the vagina. In front of the urethra, between it and the clitoris, the two halves of the bulb are brought into direct communication with each other by a smaller venous plexus called the pars intermedia, which in turn is continuous with the erectile tissue of the glans clitoridis. To obtain a proper idea of these connections, it is neces- sary to study specimens which have been specially injected and prepared. The arrangement of erectile tissue in the female, at first sight so unlike, corresponds in a remark- able degree to the bulb, corpus spongiosum, and glans penis in man. The apparent dissimilarity is due to the presence of the uro-genital fissure and orifice of the vagina. Let us suppose for a moment that these are obliterated ; the two halves of the bulb would then be in contact with each other, and its entire surface would be covered by a muscular stratum, after the manner of the accelerator urinse in the male. Further, the urethra would be surrounded by erectile tissue, and the pa7's intermedia would be seen to correspond in some extent to that portion of the corpus spongiosum which in man lies in front of the bulb, and becomes continuous with the glans. The Clitoris.â€”The crura clitoridis have already

FRONT OF THE UPPER ARM. 27 superficial at different levels—the one a little lower down than the other. The cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia close to the outer side of the tendon of the biceps, and it can very readily be found at this- point. Superficial Veins.—Observe the arrangement of the superficial veins at the bend of the elbow. The. anterior and posterior ulnar veins will be found on the inner side of the forearm, the radial vein on the outer side, and the median joined by the proftmda vein in the middle line of the forearm. The median divides into two diverging branches—Yiz.^thG^median basilic directed upwards and inwards over the bicipital fascia, and the media?t cephalic passing upwards and outwards. The .anterior and posterior ulnar veins may now be traced to^ their junction with the median basilic, and the result- ant vein—tJie basilic—can be followed upwards to the middle of the arm, where it usually disappears by pierc- ing the deep fascia. The radial vein joins the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein, and this may be followed up the outer aspect of the arm. Deep Fascia.—The brachial aponeurosis is in the next place to be cleaned by the removal of the superficial fatty layer, and its attachment to the bony points of the elbow made out. Notice how it is connected with the tendons of the deltoid, pectoralis major, &c., and more especially the accession of fibres it acquires at the bend of the elbow from the tendon of the biceps. These fibres constitute the bicipital or

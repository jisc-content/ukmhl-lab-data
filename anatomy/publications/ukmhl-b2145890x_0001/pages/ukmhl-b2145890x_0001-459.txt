233 PELVIC FASCIA. with the finger nails, the pelvic fascia will be brought into view. To expose it anteriorly, the bladder must be forcibly dragged backwards from the pubes, and the intervening areolar tissue taken away. At this point the pelvic fascia will not be encountered until we have descended to within half-an-inch from the lower end of the symphysis. Here it is so thick that it is beyond injury so long as we work with the fingers, or the handle of the knife, but laterally it is thin, and great care must be taken. The extra-peritoneal tissue which surrounds the internal iliac vessels must also be removed, and the relation of their parietal branches to the fascia made out. Dissection from Below.—The object of this dissection is to expose the perineal surface of the fascia. The pelvis must be placed so • that the outlet looks upwards. The fat having previously been removed from the ischio-rectal fossa, divide the inferior hse- morrhoidal vessels and nerves if they are still present, and then raise the levator ani muscle from the side of the rectum. To do this the muscle must be cut transversely about an inch above the anus. At first the levator ani will be observed to rest upon the side of the gut, separated from it, however, by a well-marked layer of fascia (the rectal layer of pelvic fascia), but as the dissector proceeds with the dissection the muscle will be found higher up to be in close contact with the under surface of the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia. Lastly, he will come to the line of origin of the muscle from the pelvic fascia—the line along

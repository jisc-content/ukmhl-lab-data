LOWER LIMB. 100 margin of the sartorius, and a delicate branch may be traced to the coats of the femoral artery. Having followed these nerves to their various destinations, the dissector may clean and then reflect the adductor brevis. This will bring into view the posterior division of the obturator nerve lying upon the surface of the adductor magnus. It is chiefly expended in the supply of this muscle, but it also gives filaments to the obturator externus and a delicate twig to the knee-joint. This latter branch pierces the lower fibres of the adductor magnus, and has already been seen in the popliteal space lying upon the popliteal artery. Adductor Magnus and Gracilis.—These muscles should now be cleaned and examined. In the case of the adductor magnus the tendinous arches formed for the passage of the perforating arteries and the large opening for the transmission of the femoral artery deserve the special attention of the student. The adductor magnus should now be detached from the innominate bone, in order that we may obtain a more satisfactory view of the obturator externus muscle and some small branches from the obturator artery. Obturator Externus — Obturator Artery — Psoas and Iliacus.—Clean the obturator externus and note its position in relation to the hip-joint. As it winds behind the neck of the femur to reach the digital fossa, it lies in relation to the inferior aspect of the capsular ligament. The obturator artery belongs to the dissector of the abdomen, but it is of interest to the dissector of the lower limb inasmuch as twigs from

GLUTEAL REGION. 59 dissector, owing to the close connection of the muscle with important structures which lie subjacent to it. It must be thrown down from its origin. Begin by- freeing the anterior and posterior borders of the muscle, and introducing the hand underneath it. Now, with the left hand still under the muscle (supposing that it is the left side of the body), detach the muscular fibres in turn from the dorsum ilii, sacrum, coccyx, and great sacro-sciatic ligament.* In removing the muscle from the latter attachment, the coccygeal branch of the sciatic artery which pierces the ligament is necessarily cut. As we con- tinue to turn the muscle downwards, numerous blood- vessels and nerves are displayed, sinking into its sub- stance. The arteries are—(i.) The superficialdiwlsion of tYieglictealdLrt&ry; and (2.) Branches of the i-a^^zV artery. The former enter the muscle at a higher level than the latter. The nerves are—(i.) Some i^^a^;/branches from the sacral plexus ; and (2.) A few twigs from the small sciatic nerve. These vessels and nerves must be very carefully cleaned and isolated, and then, in order that the muscle may be fully reflected, they must be divided. In doing this it is well to leave attached to each a portion of muscle substance, so that they may be afterwards recognised as the vessels and nerves of supply to the gluteus maximus. On the second day the dissector undertakes the dissection of those structures which are displayed by the reflection of the gluteus maximus. * On the right side of the body begin at the coccyx, and work upwards.

Vertical section through the pubic arch to show the two perineal com- partments and their contents, and also the manner in which the parietal pelvic fascia blends with the visceral pelvic fascia. the pubic arch. He must not suppose, because it has an attachment to the side of the pubic arch, that it stops there. It is continued onwards behind the com- pressor urethrae muscle, across the arch, and in this situation it is generally known as «the posterior layer of the triangular ligamentr Reaching the urethra, it sweeps backwards around the anterior border of the levator ani, and joins the visceral layer (Fig. 42).

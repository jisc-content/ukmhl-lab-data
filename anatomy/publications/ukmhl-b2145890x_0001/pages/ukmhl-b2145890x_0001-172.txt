i6o THORAX. nerve between it and the pneumogastric nerve. The cardiac branch from the left pneumogastric is the smaller of the two, and it may be recognised from its lying nearer the phrenic than the other. The super- ficial cardiac plexus can now be dissected. Its position upon the left pulmonary artery in the concavity of the aortic arch should be noted, as also the numerous twigs which it receives from the deep cardiac plexus. The pericardium should now be cleaned. In remov- ing the loose areolar tissue from its anterior surface you will in all probability notice two ligamentous bands which connect it to the posterior aspect of the sternum. Of these, one—inferior sterno-pericardiac ligament—binds it to the ensiform cartilage, whilst the other—the superior pericardiac ligament—connects it with the manubrium sterni. The upper surface of the diaphragm should be carefully cleaned at the same time, in order that its relation to the pericardium may be studied. • The pericardium is a conical sac, the base of which rests upon the diaphragm. When denuded of the loose tissue which surrounds it, the strong dense character of the fibrous membrane which forms the outer layer of the sac will be seen. Note how the pericardium narrows as it is traced upwards, how its outer fibrous layer is pierced by the various vessels which pass to and from the heart, and how this layer is gradually lost upon the coats of these vessels. Next examine it in its relation to the diaphragm. It will be seen to lie upon the central tendon, but also to extend outwards for a short distance on the muscular fibres

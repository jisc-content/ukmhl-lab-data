201 THE DIAPHRAGM. fibrous band which arches across the middle line and connects the tendinous portions of the two crura. Behind, a fibrous expansion is prolonged inwards, so as to limit the aperture posteriorly, and in this manner an almost complete fibrous ring is formed around the aorta.* The structures which pass through the aortic opening are—(i.) the aorta, (2.) the thoracic duct, and (3.) the vena azygos major—in this order from left to right. The vena caval opening is at a higher level, being situated opposite the ninth dorsal vertebra, in front and slightly to the right of the aortic opening. Note that it is placed in the back part of the central tendon at the junction between its middle and right lobes. Its form is somewhat quadrangular, and its margins are prolonged upon the walls of the vena cava as it passes through it. The contraction of the muscular fibres of the diaphragm will therefore tend to increase the size of this opening and the calibre of the vein which it holds. In addition to the vena cava, one or two minute twigs from the right phrenic nerve may be transmitted through the vena caval opening. The oesophageal opening is an oval or elliptical foramen in the muscular part of the diaphragm. It lies in front and slightly to the left of the aortic aperture, and also at a higher level, being placed opposite the lower border of the body of the ninth * On the left side the fibrous expansion which passes inwards behind the aorta is often absent. On both sides it is attached to the anterior aspect of the body of the last dorsal vertebra.

83 ABDOMINAL WALL. the muscle anteriorly. Ltferiorly, the posterior wall of the sheath is also absent, and the rectus rests on External oblique. Internal oblique. Trausversalis. Fascia trausversalis. Fig. 13. the transversalis fascia. Here, however, the anterior wall is formed by a blending of all three aponeuroses. The lower free margin of the posterior lamella of the sheath can be easily defined by raising the rectus and working with the handle of the knife. It usually presents a sharp lunated edge, the concavity of which is directed downwards to the pubes. It is called the semilunar fold of Douglas. The deep epigastric artery will be observed to enter the sheath by passing up- wards in front of this free border. Linea Alba.â€”The linea alba can now be studied to the best advantage. It is a dense fibrous cord or band which extends perpendicularly between the ensiform cartilage and the symphysis pubis. It is very generally regarded as the continuation downwards of the sternum. It is formed by the union and decussation of the fibres composing the aponeuroses of the two oblique and the transversales muscles of opposite sides. Above the umbilicus it is somewhat broader than in its lower part. A close examination will show that it is pierced by several small round openings for the transmission of blood- vessels, and from some of these the dissector may even

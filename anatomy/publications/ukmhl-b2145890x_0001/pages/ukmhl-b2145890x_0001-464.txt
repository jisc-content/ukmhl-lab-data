238 ABDOMEN. with each other over a very limited part of the posterior portion of the ilio-pectineal line. Parietal Pelvic Fascia—The parietal or lining portion of the pelvic fascia must be examined from three different points of view, viz.—(i.) posteriorly; (2.) laterally ; (3.) anteriorly.' On the posterior wall of the pelvis, the parietal pelvic fascia, is of little importance. It is simply represented by a thin cellular membrane covering, the anterior aspect of the pyriformis muscle, and the sacral plexus of nerves. Laterally, it is strong and dense, and its connections must be carefully studied. Superiorly, it is attached for a distance of about one inch to the back part of the ilio-pectineal line, where it will be observed to be directly continuous with the fascia iliaca, which is inserted into the same line; but the attachment of both to the bone is weak, so that by passing a probe down behind the latter the continuity of the two mem- branes can be determined. In front of this, the line of attachment of the parietal pelvic fascia leaves the ilio-pectineal line; it descends obliquely along the superior border of the obturator internus muscle to the upper margin of the thyroid foramen, and, opposite the groove on the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone, there is a break in its bony attachment. At this point it turns over^ the upper margin of the obturator internus, and, join- ing the thyroid membrane on the other side, con- verts the groove into a canal. From this onwards the line of attachment upon the posterior aspect of the

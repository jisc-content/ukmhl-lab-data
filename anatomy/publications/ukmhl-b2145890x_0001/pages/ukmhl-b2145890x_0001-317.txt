ABDOMINAL WALL. 93 Superior Epigastric and Musculo-phrenic Arteries are the two terminal branches of the internal mammary. The siipeinor epigastric will be found behind the rectus muscle and within the upper part of its sheath. It gives twigs to the rectus, and anasto- moses with the deep epigastric. The musculo-phrenic can only be seen by reflecting the transversalis from the ribs. It will be found at the level of the eighth rib. From this it proceeds downwards and backwards, along the attachment of the diaphragm to the last intercostal space. It gives branches to the diaphragm and others (the anterior intercostals), which enter the lower intercostal spaces. When the transversalis fascia is reflected the only layers which intervene between the dissector and the abdominal cavity are the extra-peritoneal fatty tissue and the parietal peritoneum. If the subject be a male, now is the best time for the student to examine the constitution of the scrotum, spermatic cord, and testicle. This can only be done at present on the right side, as the parts on the opposite side must be kept in situ for the study of hernia. After this, however, the dissection can be repeated on the left side. Scrotum.â€”This is a pendulous purse-like arrange- ment of the skin and superficial fascia for the lodg- ment of the testicles. The skin composing it is of a dark colour and rugose, and is traversed along the middle line by a median raphe or ridge, an indication of its bilateral character.

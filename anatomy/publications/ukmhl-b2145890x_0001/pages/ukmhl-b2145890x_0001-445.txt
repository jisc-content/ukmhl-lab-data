LUMBAR PLEXUS. 219 are five in number, and pass outwards in the sub- stance of the psoas muscle. They increase in size from above downwards, and each nerve is joined by two twigs from the sympathetic cord. Branches are given by them to the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The first three lumbar nerves, with a part of the fourth unite in a loop-like manner to form the lumbar plexus, whilst the remaining part of the fotirth joins the fifth to form the lumbosacral cord. Lumbar Plexus.—This plexus is placed in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae in the substance of the psoas. Above it is usually con- nected with the last dorsal nerve by a small twig which descends in the substance of the quadratus lumborum to the first lumbar nerve; below it is brought into communication with the sacral plexus by the branch of the fourth nerve, which enters into the formation of the lumbo-sacral cord. The following are the branches which proceed from the lumbar plexus :— (i.) Ilio hypogastric, ) (;jgj-iyg(j {xqxq. ist lumbar nerve. (2.) Ilio-mgmnal, J (3.) Genito-crural, „ ist and 2nd lumbar nerves. (4.) External cutaneous, „ 2nd and 3rd lumbar nerves. (5.) Anterior crural, „ 2nd, 3rd and 4th lumbar nerves. (6.) Obturator, 3rd and 4th lumbar nerves.

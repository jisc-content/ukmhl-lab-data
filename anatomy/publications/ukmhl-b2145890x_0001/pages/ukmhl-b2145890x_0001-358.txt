134 ABDOMEN. carried downwards over the posterior abdominal wall into the pelvis, where it may be traced over the rectum and bladder * to both of which it gives partial coverings, and then on to the anterior abdominal wall, where it becomes continuous with the layer which we left here. The two anterior layers of the great omentum therefore proceed upwards to the under surface of the diaphragm, and there separate, the one passing for- wards over the anterior portion of its under surface to reach the anterior wall of the abdomen, whilst the other is directed backwards over the posterior part of its under surface to reach the posterior wall of the abdo- men. On their way up to the diaphragm these layers enclose the stomach, form the gastro-hepatic omentum, and partially enclose the liver. On the other hand, the two posterior layers are directed backwards to the spine, and there separate. In passing back they enclose the transverse colon, form the transverse meso-colon, whilst at the spine the third part of the duodenum lies between them. The one layer ascends to become continuous with the layer on the posterior abdominal wall. The other layer passes downwards, forms the mesentery proper, enters the pelvis, and then reaches the anterior abdominal wall. A reference to Fig. 21 will show that the peritoneal sac is arranged in two pouches, a large pouch in front and a S7naller pouch situated behind it. The large * In the female it also gives a covering to the uterus, but the dis- position of the peritoneum in the pelvis, both male and female, will be fully described in connection with the pelvic viscera.

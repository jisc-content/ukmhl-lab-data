PELVIC ARTICULATIONS. 289 to the upper part of that portion of the sacrum which forms the anterior wall of the sacral canal. The ligainenta subflava are two short bands of yellow elastic tissue placed one on each side of the mesial plane. Superiorly they are attached to the anterior aspect of the lower border of the laminae of the last lumbar vertebra; whilst inferiorly they are fixed to the posterior aspect of the laminae of the first sacral segment, close to their upper margin. The interspinous ligament connects the lower border of the spinous process of the last lumbar vertebra with the upper border of the spinous process of the first sacral vertebra. The supraspinous ligament is a thickened band which joins the tips of the same spinous processes. So far, then, the ligaments of the lumbo-sacral articulation are identical with those which, above the level of the sacrum, help to bind the several segments of the spinal column together. The sacro-vertebral and tho-lumbar ligaments have also their representa- tives higher up. ^ The sacro-vertebral ligament corresponds with the intertransverse ligaments. It is a strong triangular fibrous band attached by its apex to the tip and lower border of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra Expanding as it proceeds downwards, it is fixed below to the posterior part of the base of the sacrum where some of its fibres intermingle with those of the sacro-iliac ligaments. The zho-lumbar ligament may be considered to be TrxT"' ''''^ costo-transverse liga- U

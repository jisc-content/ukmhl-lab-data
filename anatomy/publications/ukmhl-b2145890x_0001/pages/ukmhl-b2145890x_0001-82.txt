70 LOWER LIMB. To reach the vein the student should take its external saphenous tributary as his guide. To the inner side of the vein, and at a deeper plane, the artery will be observed lying upon the femur. In clearing away the fatty areolar tissue which surrounds these vessels, take note of two or three small lymphatic glands which lie embedded within it upon each side of the artery. Again great care must be taken in cleaning the vessels not to injure the obturator nerve which lies upon the coats of the artery. It is impossible in the present dissection to expose the popliteal artery in its entire length. Its division into its two terminal branches (viz., the anterior and posterior tibial) at the lower border of the popliteus muscle is hidden from view by the soleus muscle. It gives off—(i.) muscular, (2.) articular hx^nz\i^s>. Muscular branches may be followed to the ham- string muscles in the upper part of the space, and to the muscles of the calf in the lower portion of the space {surat). The articular branches are five in number—two superior, two inferior, and an azygos. The superior articular arteries spring from the mam trunk as it passes between the condyles of the femur. One proceeds from each side of the popliteal, and they are called internal and external according to the direc- tion which they take. They will be found resting directly upon the back of the femur, and they will be observed to incline slightly upwards, and then to wind round the bone immediately above the condyles. The external is the larger of the two. The student is veiy apt to mistake a muscular branch for one or other

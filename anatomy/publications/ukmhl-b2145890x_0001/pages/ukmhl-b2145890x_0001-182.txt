The anterior wall of the ventricle can, in this way, be raised in the form of a V-shaped flap and turned to the right. Wash away the blood and clots. With the exception of the conus arteriosus, the interior of which is smooth and even, the inner surface of the walls of the right ventricle is rendered extremely irregular by the projection of fleshy ridges called columnce caniece. It is customary to describe these as presenting three different forms—(^.) Simple elongated ridges ; (^.) fleshy slips free throughout the greater par^t of their extent, but fixed to the wall by their two extremities ; (^.) conical fleshy projections of consider- able size attached by their bases, only, and called musadi papillares. The free end of each of these papillary muscles gives origin to several delicate thread- like tendons—chordcs tendinecE—^rv^ by these they are brought into connection with the segments of the auriculo-ventricular valve. A transverse fleshy band will be noticed to spring from the base of the anterior papillary muscle and stretch across the ventricular cavity to the septum, to which it is attached. This is the moderator band By fixing the yielding anterior wall of the ventricle to the more solid septum, it pre- vents over-distension of the cavity. There are two openings in the right ventricle—(i.) The auriculo-ventricular, which gives admission to the stream of blood ; (2.) the pulmonary, through which the blood passes into the pulmonary artery. Both

156 ABDOMEN. far between, and a little beyond this they disappear altogether. The chief function of these valvulas conniventes is to increase the absorbing and secreting surface of the small intestine. It is also probable that they prevent the too rapid passage of the aliment along the tube, and that they break the flow so as to mix up the contents of the small intestine with the intestinal juices and other secretions poured into the canal. Another peculiarity characteristic of the mucous lining of the small intestine is the presence of villi. These are minute processes of the mucous membrane, varying in length fron one-fourth to one-third of a line. They 6ccur in enormous numbers over the entire extent of the inner surface of the gut, not only upon the valvulse conniventes, but also in the intervals between them, and they give to the mucous membrane a velvety or fleecy appearance. To obtain a proper view of these minute villous processes it is necessary to float out a portion of the small intestine in water after it has been carefully cleansed from adhering mucus, and examine it with an ordinary pocket lens. If a portion of the upper end of the jejunum be placed side by side with a portion of the lower part of the ileum, and inspected in this manner, the student will readily detect that the villi are, if anything, larger, and that they are decidedly more numerous in the jejunum than in the ileum. They diminish gradually in number and in size as we pass down the small intestine. Beyer's patches and the solitary glands must also be looked for. Frequently they are difficult to find, but

ABDOMEN. 126 it is clothed anteriorly and laterally by peritoneum, whilst its posterior aspect is bare. It is thus fixed in its position. In some few cases, however, the peritoneum may be found investing it completely, and connecting it with the iliac fossa by a distinct fold called the meso-ccecum. When this happens the coecum enjoys a certain amount of movement, and may even form a part of the contents of a hernial sac. The ileum opens into it upon its inner aspect about two and a-half inches above its blind end, and marks the point where it becomes continuous with the ascending colon. In connection with the coecum the dissector will find the vermiform appendix. This is a narrow coecal tube, which has a diameter slightly greater than that of a goose quill, and a length which varies from three to five or six inches. It opens into the coecum upon its inner and back aspect below the termination of the ileum. It is held in position by a minute peritoneal fold, which constitutes its mesentery. The ascending colon extends vertically upwards through the right lumbar region. It is continuous below with the coecum, whilst above it becomes the hepatic flexure. Its relation to the peritoneum is similar to that of the coecum ; it is clothed anteriorly and laterally, whilst posteriorly it is bare and this bare surface rests upon the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum muscle, upon the right kidney and upon the second part of the duodenum, with each of which it is connected by a little loose areolar tissue. In rare cases the peritoneum may surround the tube and form behind it a very short meso-colon.

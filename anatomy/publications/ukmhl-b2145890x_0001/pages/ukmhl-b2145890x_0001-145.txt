t33 SOLE OF THE FOOT. its course the nerve gives ofT two branches—(a) to the musculus accessorius; and (b) to the abductor minimi digiti. Second Layer.—The abductor minimi digiti should be detached from its origin and turned forwards in order to make a good display of the structures composing the second stratum of the sole. Observe that as the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis enters the sole it inclines inwards towards the great toe, whilst the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum inclines outwards to reach the middle of the foot where it divides into four tendons—one for each toe. Further, note that the tendons of these two muscles cross each other in the sole—the flexor tendon of the hallux lying subjacent to the flexor tendon of the other digits, and giving to it a tendinous slip.* The musculus accessorius which is inserted into the tendon of the long flexor of the toes and the four lumbrical muscles which arise from the flexor tendons should now be cleaned. Note the position of the long plantar ligament between the two heads of origin of the accessorius. Flexor Sheaths.—Before tracing the flexor tendons * Professor Turner has called attention to the fact that this slip, which passes from the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, varies greatly in magnitude and in the manner m which it is connected with the flexor tendons of the toes. In the majority of cases it goes to the tendons of the second and third toes ; in some cases, however, only to the tendon of the second toe or to the tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. Very rarely does it divide so as to bring all the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum into con- nection with the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis.

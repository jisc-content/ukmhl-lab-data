243 PELVIC FASCIA. the corresponding layer of the opposite side. As it proceeds inwards it splits to enclose and form a cap- sule for the vesicula seminalis and the vas deferens. The rectal, or lowest layer, is prolonged downwards upon the side of the rectum—between it and the levator ani muscle—and then, turning backwards behind the gut, it becomes continuous with the same layer of the other side. The rectum is thus enclosed in a sheath formed by the recto-vesical and rectal layers of the pelvic fascia. Bladder. / Vesicula seminalis 1 and vas deferens. Rectum. Fig. 43. Proceeding forwards to the region of the prostate and the neck of the bladder, the connections of the three layers will be found to be somewhat altered. Substitute the prostate for the bladder, and carry the vesical layer upwards over it, so as to meet its fellow of the opposite side, and the arrangement will be understood (Fig. 44). The prostate is thus enclosed in a capsule, the walls of which are exceedingly strong and dense. But at this point the lower part of the rectum passes backwards to reach the surface, and as

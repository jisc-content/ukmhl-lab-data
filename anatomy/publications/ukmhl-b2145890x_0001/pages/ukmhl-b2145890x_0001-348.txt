124 * ABDOMEN. diminish slightly in calibre. It is divided into three portions, viz.:— (i.) The duodenum. (2.) The jejunum. (3.) The ileum. The duodenum is the name which is given to the first part of the small intestine. It equals in length- the breadth of twelve fingers, and extends from the pylorus to the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. As it lies deeply in the greater part of its extent, and as dissection is necessary to bring out its relations, it is better to defer its descrip- tion till later on. The jejunum and ileum constitute the coils of the small intestine. The jejunum begins where the duodenum ends—viz., on the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra ; and the ileum ends, as we have seen, in the right iliac fossa by joining the coecum or the commencement of the great intestine. The subdivision of the small intestine is of the most arbitrary kind. After mapping off the duodenum it is customary for anatomists to look upon the upper two-fifths of the remainder as being jejunum, and the lower three-fifths as being ileum. There is no hard- and-fast line of demarcation between the three divi- sions—the one passes insensibly into the other; and as the distinction is only to be found by an examina- tion of the interior of the tube, it is impossible for the student at present to see any difference at all between them.

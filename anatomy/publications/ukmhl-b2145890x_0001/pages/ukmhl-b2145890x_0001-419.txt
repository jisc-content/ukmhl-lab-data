THE KIDNEYS. But the two kidneys also show a difference in shape and position. The left kidney is longer and narrower, and at the same time it is placed at a slightly higher level—reaching to the upper border of the eleventh rib; whereas the right kidney only reaches to the middle of the corresponding rib of the other side. Keeping these facts in mind, the student can never experience any difficulty in determining the side to which a given kidney belongs. Even allowing that the upper end cannot be distinguished from the lower end, or the anterior surface from the posterior surface, by differences in their appearance (which is often the case in a dissecting-room kidney), the ureter alone is sufficient for the purpose. It shows the posterior surface from its position at the hilus and the lower ■end from its curving downwards towards it. Kidney Capsule and Kidney Substance.—The kidney is invested by a strong fibrous coat, which can be easily stripped from its surface. Divide this capsule along the external margin of the organ and peel it off towards the hilus. Here it enters the sinus and becomes continuous with the sheaths of the vessels entering the gland and with the external coat of the ureter. The kidney should now be cut into two in the longi- tudinal direction. Use a large knife, and, entering it at the external border, carry it steadily through the gland substance to the hilus. This being done, examine in. the first place the manner in which the ureter or duct is connected with the kidney. As it approaches PART II. Q

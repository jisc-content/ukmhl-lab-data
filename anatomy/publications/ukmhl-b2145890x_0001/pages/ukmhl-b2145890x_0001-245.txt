MALE PERINEUM. 21 sweep around the corpus spongiosum so as to invest it completely, and are inserted into a common apon- eurosis upon the upper surface of this portion of the penis ; lastly, the anterior fibi'-es form two long narrow muscular bands which • diverge from each other like the limbs of the letter Yj ^^id, passing forwards over the sides of the corpora cavernosa, are inserted into an aponeurosis on the dorsum of the penis. Thus the posterior fibres partially embrace the bulb; the middle fibres embrace the corpus spongiosum; whilst the anterior fibres embrace the body of the penis. The accelerator urinse supports the urethra during micturition, and by its contraction it ejects the last drops of urine or semen from the passage. < Erector penis, or ischio-cavernosus.—This muscle lies upon the crus penis. It arises from the inner aspect of the tuber ischii, and is inserted by an aponeurotic expansion into the lower and outer surface of the anterior portion of the crus. Perineal Nerve.—This is one of the two terminal branches of the pudic nerve. It supplies twigs to the skin, to the muscles of the perineum, and to the bulb of the penis. The cutaneous branches have already been followed out. They are the posterior and anterior superficial perineal nerves. Miiscular twies may be traced to each of the three superficial perineal muscles, whilst a few minute offsets pierce the triangular ligament to supply the compressor urethrae muscle. The nerve to the bulb is a small branch which breaks up into filaments for the supply of the corpus spongiosum.

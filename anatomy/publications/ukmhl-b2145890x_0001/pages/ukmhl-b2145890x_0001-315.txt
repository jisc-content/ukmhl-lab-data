ABDOMINAL WALL. 91 and the fascia transversalis. It soon, however, pierces the fascia, and, passing in front of the fold of Douglas, ascends between the rectus muscle and the posterior lamella of its sheath. These are its immediate relations, but there are others of equal importance— viz., (i.) as it runs upwards it Hes close to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring; (2.) as the sper- matic cord traverses the inguinal canal it lies in front of this artery, only separated from it by transversalis fascia; (3.) as the vas deferens passes from the in- guinal canal into the abdominal cavity it hooks round the outer side of the artery ; (4.) and lastly, before the vessel reaches the rectus muscle it lies unde cover of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles. The branches which spring from the deep epigastric are— (i.) Cremasteric. (2.) Pubic. (3.) Cutaneous. (4.) Muscular. The cremasteric is a small twig which supplies the cremaster muscle and anastomoses with the spermatic artery. The pubic, also insignificant in size, goes to the back of the pubes, where it anastomoses with a small branch from the obturator. The importance of this branch arises from the fact that the anastomosis which it establishes sometimes becomes so large as to take the place of the obturator artery. The muscular branches are given to the substance of the rectus, and the cutaneous offsets pierce the abdominal muscles and anastomose with the superficial epigastric artery.

THORACIC CAVITY. brought clearly before the studentâ€”zV/ front, the pos- terior surface of the sternum clothed in its lower part by the left triangularis sterni muscle, and above by the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles ; behind, the pericardium covered by some loose areolar tissue in which ramify a few lymphatic vessels and some minute arterial twigs from the internal mam- mary artery ; and upon each side, the pleura as it passes from the back of the sternum to the front of the pericardium. The remains of the thymus gland constitute the only content of this space. It is situated in its upper part.* The student will now understand the object in making the section through the central portion of the sternum extend from the left margin of the bone obliquely upwards. He will notice that, whilst the right pleura extends upon the back of the sternum to the middle line of the body, the left pleura falls somewhat short of this. The anterior mediastinal space, therefore, is placed to. the left of the mesial plane. The parietal pleura should now be separated from * The left internal mammary artery, the left triangularis sterni muscle, and the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are frequently described as contents of this space. So far as the internal mammary artery is concerned the statement is altogether erroneous. In no part of its course does it lie within the space. It is immaterial whether the student looks upon the origins of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid as being contents, or as entering into the formation of the anterior boundary. The triangularis sterni should certainly be regarded as a boundary, because the pleura is reflected from the deep surface of the muscle on to the pericardium. Indeed, we might as well look upon the serratus magnus muscle as being a content of the axillary space. i

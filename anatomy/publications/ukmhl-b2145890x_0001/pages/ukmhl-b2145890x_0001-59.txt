BACK AND OUTER BORDER OF FOREARM. 4/ off from the radial as it passes forwards between the first and second metacarpal bones. The first is dis- played by reflecting the adductor poUicis, and the latter by reflecting the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Trace them in their course upon the index and thumb respectively. m BACK AND OUTER BORDER OP FOREARM. The cutaneous nerves and vessels in this locality have already been studied. The parts which still require dissection are :— (i.) The deep fascia. (2.) The supinator and extensor muscles. (3.) The posterior interosseous artery. (4.) The perforating branch of the anterior interosseous artery. (5.) The posterior interosseous nerve and its branches. Deep Fascia and Superficial Muscles.—In re- moving the deep fascia it will be found to be insepar- ably connected near the elbow-joint with the muscles which spring from the external condyle. Here, then, it will be necessary to let it remain undisturbed. The fascia being raised, the superficial layer of muscles must be cleaned. The supinator longus has already been cleared of its sheath, but proceeding inwards from this the student will meet in with the extensor carpi radialis longior, the extensor carpi radialis brevior, the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor minimi digiti, and the extensor carpi ulnaris. Further, the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii pollicis will be seen coming out between

J ^6 ABDOMEN. Stomach, and distributes twigs to both aspects of the viscus. ^ The hepatic plexus follows the hepatic artery, the vena portse, and the bile duct to the transverse fissure of the liver. It is joined by twigs from the left pneu- mogastric, and also from the right diaphragmatic plexus, and it gives origin to the pyloric, right gastro- epiploic,superiorpancreatico-duodenal,^n<i cystic plexuses, which accompany the arteries of the same names The splenic plexus is prolonged along the splenic artery to the spleen. It is joined by twigs from the right pneumogastric, and gives off branches to the pancreas and to the fundus of the stomach, and also the left gastro-epiploic plexus. Renal Plexus.-This consists of numerous nerves which spring chiefly from the outer part of the semi- lunar ganglion. Some will be found, however, coming from the cc^liac and others from the aortic plexus. The smallest or third splanchnic nerve, when it is pre- sent joins this plexus. Thus constituted, the filaments of the renal plexus run with the renal artery to the hilus of the kidney, and are distributed to the gland substance. Several twigs are likewise given to the spermatic plexus. A few scattered ganglia are usually found in connection with the renal plexus. Suprarenal Plexus.-The dissector will no doubt be struck with the large number of nerves which supply the suprarenal body. The plexus seems altogether out of proportion to the small organ to which it is distributed. The nerves composing it are chiefly

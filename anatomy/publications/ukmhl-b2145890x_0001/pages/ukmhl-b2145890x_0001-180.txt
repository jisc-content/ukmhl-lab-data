THORAX. i68 blood flowing from the mouth of the inferior vena cava is directed so as to impinge against the septum between the auricles. The auriculo-ventricular orifice is the large oval opening situated at the lower part or floor of the auricle. Through this aperture three fingers can be readily passed into the ventricle. If the student now looks between this opening and the orifice of the inferior vena cava, he will discover the mouth of the coronary sinus, imperfectly guarded by a fold of endocardium, v/hich receives the name of the coronary valve or valve of Thebesius. An attentive examination of the inner surface of the auricular wall will further reveal several minute, round, irregularly-scattered openings called the foramina Thebesii. Some of these are simply small coecal pits in the substance of the heart, whilst others are the mouths of minute veinsâ€”the venae Thebesii. Examine, in the next place, the posterior wall of the right auricle. It is formed by the partition which separates the two auricles from each other. Upon this an oval depression, surrounded by a pro- minent ridge, will be noticed a short distance above the mouth of the inferior vena cava. The depression is called fossa ovalis, and it marks the position of the foramen ovale of the foetal heart. The ridge, which is deficient below, is crescentic in form, and is called the annulus ovalis. In/a few cases, a communication between the two auricles may be found by slipping a probe under the upper and best-marked part of the annulus. Stretching between the anterior horn of the annulus ovalis and the anterior margin of the mouth of

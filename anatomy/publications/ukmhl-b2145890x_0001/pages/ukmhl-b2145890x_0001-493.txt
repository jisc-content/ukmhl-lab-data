267 PELVIC NERVES. behind the anus, and also into the side of the lower end of the coccyx. The levator ani draws its nervous supply from the fourth sacral nerve and the inferior hcemorrhoidal 7ierve. Ooccygeus.—This is a small triangular muscle which lies behind and upon the same plane as the levator ani—indeed, their margins are contiguous. It arises by its narrow end from the pelvic surface of the ischial spine, and from the small sciatic ligament; expanding as it passes inwards, it is inserted into the margin of the lower piece of the sacrum and the margin and anterior aspect of the coccyx. It is supplied by twigs from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves. Pelvic Nerves. Spinal Nerves.—The anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves in the pelvis are six in number—viz., five sacral and one coccygeal These should next be dissected, and the various branches which they give off followed to their distribution, or the point where they quit the pelvis. In every case, it is well to begin by cleaning the lumbo-sacral cord and securing the superior gluteal nerve which springs from it. The upper four sacral nerves appear through the anterior sacral foramina ; the fifth sacral nerve comes forward in the interval between the sacrum and coccyx; and the coccygeal a little lower down at the side of the coccyx. The two latter are very minute, but

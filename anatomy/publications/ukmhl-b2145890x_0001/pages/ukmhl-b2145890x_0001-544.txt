ABDOMEN. 3i8 now be pared so as to extend the view into the interior of the uterus. By this dissection the student will observe—(i )' That the walls of the uterus consist of three marked layers—viz., a peritoneal, a muscular, and a mucous (2.) That the uterine wall differs in thickness at different points. Thus it is thickest opposite the middle of the body, and again at the fundus it is thicker in the mesial plane than it is nearer the entrance of the Fallopian tubes. The cavity in the interior of the uterus is much smaller than would be naturally expected from the size of the organ. It is subdivided arbitrarily into an ttpper part, which occupies the body, and a lower or cervical part, which occupies the cervix. The upper portion is the larger of the two, and is triangular in form—the sides of the triangle being incurved, and its base directed upwards. At the two extremities of the base are the constricted open- ings of the Fallopian tubes. The lower cervical portion is fusiform or spindle- shaped in form, being also slightly compressed from before backwards. Above, it is somewhat constricted, and at the junction of the body with the cervix of the uterus it becomes continuous with the upper triangular part of the cavity. This narrow opening is termed the OS uteri internum. Below, the cavity of the uterus opens into the vagina at the os uteri externum.

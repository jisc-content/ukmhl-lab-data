130 ABDOMEN. or the serous pericardium, or the tunica vaginalis ; in these cases the serous membrane lines a cavity which holds a single viscus, and the reflection of the membrane from the walls on to the viscus, and from the viscus again on to the walls can be followed with the greatest ease. The peritoneal sac, on the other hand, belongs to a cavity which contains numerous viscera, some of which have undergone striking changes in position during development, and this is the reason why it is so very complicated. In opening the cavity of the abdomen, the peritoneal sac has been laid open, and the inner surface of the membrane is observed to present the usual smooth, polished, and glistening appearance. The part which lines the walls of the abdomen is termed the parietal peritoneum; that which is reflected on to viscera is called the visceral peritoneum. Before tracing the peritoneum through its many windings, it is well that some terms which are applied to certain of its folds should be explained. The term omentum is employed to denote a fold of peritoneum which connects the stomach with neighbouring viscera. Thus we have the great or gastro-hep^tUc omentum connecting it with the transverse colon; the small ox gastro-hepatic omentum connecting it with the liver; and the gastro-splenic omentum connecting it with the spleen. The term mesentery is applied to any fold of peritoneum which attaches the intestinal tube to the posterior wall of the abdomen, as, for example, the . mesentery proper in connection with the small intestine, the transverse meso-colon, the sigmoid meso-colon, the

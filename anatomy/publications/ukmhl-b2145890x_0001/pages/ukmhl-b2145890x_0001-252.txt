ABDOMEN. 28 middle line, and the muscular fibres which compose the two layers are inserted into a median raph^ both upon the upper and lower aspects of the urethra. This muscle is supplied by one or two delicate twigs from the perineal division of the pudic nerve.* Cowper's Glands.—As a general rule, these glands can readily be detected by raising the lower fibres of the compressor urethra. They are small lobulated bodies resembling peas both in size and shape. They are placed one on each side of the middle line, imme- diately below the membranous part of the urethra, and are overlapped by the posterior part of the bulb— separated from it, however, by the triangular ligament. From each a minute duct proceeds, but this duct does not open into the membranous portion of the urethra. It passes forwards between the wall of the urethra and the substance of the biilb for the distance of one inch, and opens on the floor of the spongy part of the urethra. Internal Pudic Artery.—The pudic artery is a *The accounts given by different writers of the muscular fibres surrounding the membranous portion of the urethra are somewhat conflicting. No less than three distinct muscles are described by some authors—viz. (i.) the compressor urethrae ; (2.) the levator urethrse, or Wilson's muscle ; and (3.) the deep transverse muscle. The two latter are only occasionally present, and should simply be looked upon as specially developed portions of the constrictor. The levator urethra consists of two minute muscular slips which descend from the back of the symphysis pudis to enclose the membranous portion of the urethra. It is inserted into the central point of the perineum. The traJtsversus perinei profundus is the name given to a few extra fibres added to the lower border of the constrictor by means of which it gains a distmct insertion into the central point of the perineum.

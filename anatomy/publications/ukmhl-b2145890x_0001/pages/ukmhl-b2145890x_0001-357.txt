THE PERITONEUM. 133 liver and diaphragm are in contact, it is reflected on to the diaphragm and proceeds forwards upon its under surface to reach the anterior wall of the abdomen. The other layer turns backwards upon the under surface of the liver, and reaching its posterior border is reflected on to the back part of the diaphragm, and turns downwards on the posterior wall of the abdomen. We will leave these layers for a little and trace the two posterior layers of the omentum. For this purpose it is necessary to turn up the great omentum over the ribs. Its two posterior layers in proceeding upwards come to the transverse colon. This they enclose, the one passing in front and the other behind, and coming in contact with each other again on the other side of the gut, they are prolonged backwards to the posterior wall of the abdomen, as the transverse meso-colon. They reach the back wall of the abdomen at the point where the transverse or third part of the duodenum extends to the left, across the spine, and here they separate. The one layer passes above this part of the duodenum, and then turns upwards over the pancreas to become continuous with the layer which we left upon the posterior wall of the abdomen. The other" layer gains the spine below the third part of the duodenum, and. is almost immediately led ofl" the posterior wall of the abdomen by the superior mesenteric vessels, which conduct it to the small intestme. Turning round the gut so as to invest it, It proceeds backwards upon the posterior aspect of the superior mesenteric vessels to the spine. In this manner the mesentery proper is formed. It is now

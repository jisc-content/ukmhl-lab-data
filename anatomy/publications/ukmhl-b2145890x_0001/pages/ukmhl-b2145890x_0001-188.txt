176 THORAX. dense reticulations on the inner surface of its walls. The muscidipapillares, with their attached chordae ten- dinese, are collected into two strongly-marked groups. The left ventricle has two openings—(i.) the auri- culo-ventricular opening, through which the blood flows from the auricle ; (2.) the aortic orifice, through which the blood flows into the aorta. Both of these apertures are situated at the base of the ventricle, the auriailo- ventricidar lying posteriorly and to the left, whilst the aortic orifice is placed anteriorly and to the right. Both openings are guarded by valves—the auriculo- ventricular opening by the mitral or bicuspid valve, and the aortic opening by the aortic valve. Examine first the mitral valve. It consists of two large pointed cusps with two smaller portions inter- vening. These are similar in structure to the cusps of the tricuspid valve, but the segments are much strons-er and thicker. The chordae tendineae from each musculus papillaris proceed to one of the two intervals between the cusps, and are attached to the adjacent margins and to the ventricular surfaces of the two cusps. Now look to the position which these cusps hold. The anterior cusp lies in front and to the right of the opening, being so placed as to intervene between the two apertures at the base of the ventricle. You will notice that both surfaces of this segment are smooth, for the very obvious reason, that the stream of blood flows over both. The posterior cusp lies behind and to the left of the opening. Looking upwards into the mouth of the aorta, the aortic valve will be seen. It is similar, in all respects

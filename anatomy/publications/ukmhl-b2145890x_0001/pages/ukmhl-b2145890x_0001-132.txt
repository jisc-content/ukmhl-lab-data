120 LOWER LIMB. the muscles on the posterior aspect of the leg will be demonstrated (Fig. 7 c, p. 107). Superficial Muscles.—Thethree superficial muscles should now be examined. Remove the fat which is usually accumulated under cover of the tendo-Achillis. This should be done carefully, because subjacent to it is an important layer of fascia which stretches betweeri the tibia and fibula, and separates the superficial from the deep group of muscles. When the fat has been removed this fascia will be seen to be very dense, and to be strengthened by numerous transverse fibres (Fig. 7 d, p. 107). It becomes continuous on the inner side of the ankle with the internal annular ligament— indeed, the dissector will not fail to observe that it takes a more prominent part in the formation of this ligament than the general aponeurosis of the limb. In the upper part of the leg it is very thin. The two heads of the gastrocnemius may now be divided about an inch and a-half from their origin. On raising the upper portion of the inner head a bursa intervening between it and the condyle of the femur, and in all probability communicating with the knee- joint, will be observed. The smooth and tendinous opposed surfaces of the gastrocnemius and soleus, and the narrow tendon of the plantaris passing downwards and inwards between them, are now brought under the notice of the dissector. Reflect the plantaris and follow its tendon downwards along the inner side of the tendo-Achillis to its insertion 'into the os calcis. Clean the tendo-Achillis right down to the lower part

148 ABDOMEN. terminal part of the superior mesenteric, and from the arch thus formed twigs are given to the lower end of the ileum, the vermiform appendix, and the coecum. The ascendinghx-^vic\i inosculates with a branch of the right colic, and sends offsets to the ascending colon. The right colic artery very frequently arises in com- mon with the ileo-colic. It takes a horizontal course to the right, and divides into two branches, a superior and an inferior. The superior branch ascends between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon to inos- culate with the middle colic; whilst the inferior branch joins the ascending part of the ileo-colic. From the convexity of these arches twigs proceed to the colon. The middle colic artery is the highest of the three branches which spring from the concavity of the superior mesenteric. It ascends between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon, and divides into a right and a left branch. The right branch joins the superior part of the right colic, whilst the left branch inosculates with the ascending part of the left colic artery, which is derived from the inferior mesenteric. The Superior Mesenteric Vein lies to the right of the artery and receives tributaries, which come from those parts of the intestinal canal which are supplied by branches from the superior mesenteric artery. Leaving the mesentery, it passes upwards in front of the duodenum, and then disappears under cover of the pancreas. Here it unites with the splenic vein to form the vena portcE. The Superior Mesenteric Nervous Plexus is a

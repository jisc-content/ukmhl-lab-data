ABDOMEN. 190 the wide gaping mouths of the terminal hepatic veins will be displayed. Trace these veins for a short distance into the substance of the gland. They are remarkable for the great tenuity of their walls, and also for the very small quantity of areolar tissue which separates them from the hepatic substance ; indeed this is so scarce that it is hardly appreciable to the naked eye. In the case of the smaller veins it is altogether absent, and the hepatic lobules rest directly upon the wall of the vessel. A section should now be made through the liver substance and the cut surface examined. The portal veins can be readily distinguished from the hepatic veins. The following are the points of difference Portal Veins. (i.) Are always accompanied by a branch of duct and a branch of hepatic artery. (2.) Mouths collapsed. (3.) Walls thicker. (4.) Walls separated from the liver substance by Glis- son's capsule. Hepatic Veins. (i.) Are solitary and not accompanied by any vessel. (2.) Mouths open and gaping. (3.) Walls exceedingly thin. (4.) Walls apparently in di- rect apposition with the liver substance. The Kidneys.—The kidneys are situated behind the peritoneum, against the posterior wall of the abdo- men—one in each lumbar region. They are envel- oped by a thick capsule of loose areolar tissue, the meshes of which are usually loaded with soft pliable fat. Clear this away, and. be careful not to remove at the same time the suprarenal body, which lies upon

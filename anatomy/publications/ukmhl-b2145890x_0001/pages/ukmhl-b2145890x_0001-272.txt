Its base is perforated, as we have seen, by the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, whilst the internal pudic artery and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris pierce it a little way external to the opening which transmits the dorsal vein of the clitoris. The so-called posterior layer of the triangular ligament is really a part of the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, as has already been explained, and it is altogether out of place to associate under one name two'structures so distinct. Opposite the pubic arch, the parietal pelvic fascia [i.e., posterior layer of trian- gular ligament) by its lower border fuses with the base of the triangular ligament. As it is traced upwards, however, it recedes from the triangular ligament, and consequently a space or interval is left between them. This interval is occupied by the following structures :— (i.) The urethra. (5-) The internal pudic (2.) A portion of the vagina. vessels, and the artery U ) The compressor urethrae to the bulb. muscle. (6.)

Detach it from the margin of the pubic arch and throw it inwards. Urethra.—The female urethra is a short wide canal, which extends from the neck of the bladder to

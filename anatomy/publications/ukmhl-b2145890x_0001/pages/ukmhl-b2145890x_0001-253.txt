29 MALE PERINEUM. branch of the internal iliac. It is met with in three different regions of the body—viz. (.1.) within the cavity of the pelvis ; (2.) in the gluteal region, where it lies upon the spine of the ischium ; and (3.) in the perineal space. It is consequently described as consisting of a pelvic, a gluteal, and a perineal part. The perineal or third part of the pudic artery enters the perineum by passing through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. At first it is placed deeply ; but, as it is traced forwards, it is found to become more superficial, and, at the same time, to incline inwards, so that, at its termination, it lies close to the middle line of the body. In the rectal triangle the pudic artery is contained within a sheath formed by the splitting of that part of the parietal pelvic fascia which forms the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. It lies fully an inch and a-half above the level of the iower border of the ischial tuber- osity, and is accompanied by two veins and the pudic nerve. The nerve occupies the lowest part of the sheath. Reaching the base of the urethral triangle, the pudic artery insinuates itself between the triangular ligament and the parietal pelvic fascia {i.e., posterior layer of the triangular ligament), and gradually emerg- ing from under cover of the bone, it proceeds forwards along the edge of the pubic arch to a point about half-an-inch below the symphysis, where it pierces the triangular ligament, and ends by dividing into two branches—viz. (i.) the artery to the corpus cavernosum, and (2.) the dorsal artery of the penis (Fig. 4, p. 23). Branches of the Pudic Artery.—The pudic has

THORACIC CAVITY. 149 (14.) The trachea and bronchi, (15.} The pneumogastric nerves. (16.) The oesophagus. (17.) The thoracic aorta and its branches. (18.) Thoracic duct. (19.) The ganghated cord of the sympathetic and the Pleura.—The dissection which has already been made shows the pleura lining the deep surface of the costal arches. This portion of the membrane is termed the parietal pleura or pleura costalis. The manner in which it enters into the formation of the anterior mediastinal space should now be examined. This entails a somewhat complicated dissection. The sternum must be divided with the saw into four portions by three separate cuts, viz.:—(i.) A transverse section through the manubrium sterni, on a line with the lower margins of the first pair of costal cartilages. (2.) A transverse cut through the lower part of the body of the sternum, in the interval between the fifth and sixth costal cartilages. (3.) An oblique section, beginning below at the inferior trans- verse cut, close to the left margin of the sternum, and carried upwards to the middle of the superior trans- verse cut. By the last section the central portion of the sternum is divided into two lateral pieces, to each of which four costal arches are attached.* * This dissection was devised by Professor Turner, and has been practised in the University dissecting-rooms for the last twenty years.

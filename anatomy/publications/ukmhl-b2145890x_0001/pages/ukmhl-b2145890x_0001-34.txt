22 UPPER LIMB. (8.) Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and teres major muscles. (9.) Burs^ in connection with the shoulder-jomt. (10.) Suprascapular nerve and artery. The divided ends of muscles should in the first place engage the attention of the student. Let him define the precise insertions of the trapezius, omo- hyoid, levator anguli scapulae, the rhomboids, and the serratus magnus, and then remove what is left of those muscles with the exception of half-an-inch close to the bone. Cutaneous Nerves—Deltoid Muscle.—Place a block in the axilla, and reflect the skin from before backwards over the deltoid muscle. In the superficial fascia, which is thus laid bare, cutaneous nerves from two sources will be found : {a) a few slender twigs which are prolonged downwards over the acromion process. These are the descending branches of the cervical plexus, and they ramify over the upper third of the deltoid, {b) the cutaneous branch of the circumflex nerve. The former are somewhat difficult to find, seeing that the main trunks have been divided in the removal of the arm, but the branch from the circum- flex is a large nerve and must in no case be over- looked. It becomes superficial at the posterior margin of the deltoid about two or three inches above its insertion, and here it is most readily found. After these nerves have been followed out and their area of distribution determined, the deltoid muscle should be cleaned. Depress the scapula, and

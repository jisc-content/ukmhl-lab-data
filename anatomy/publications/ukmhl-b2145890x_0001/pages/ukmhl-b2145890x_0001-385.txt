INTESTINAL CANAL. 159 If the longitudinal bands of muscular fibres be re- moved or divided at short intervals and the gut stretched, both sacculi and constrictions disappear, and the wall of the bowel becomes uniform. The mucous membrane of the great intestine is absolutely destitute of villi^ but solitary glands are present in considerable numbers. Coats of the Large Intestine.—The coats of the large intestine must be dissected in the same manner as in the case of the small intestine. In connection with the serous coat, the student has already taken notice of the appendices epiploicce. The external longitudinal muscular fibres have also been observed to be disposed in three flat bands. These are placed as follows:—(i.) One in relation to the attached surface; (2.) the second upon the anterior aspect; (3.) and the third along the inner aspect of the gut,—in the case of the transverse colon, this band is in relation to the inferior aspect of the tube. The internal circular muscular fibres are most distinct in the constrictions between the sacculi, but constitute a thm uniform layer over the entire extent of the gut The submucous coat is in no respect different from the corresponding coat in the small intestine. ^ Ileo-ccBcal Valve.-When the distended ccecum IS dry, the ileo-coecal valve should be examined. 1 his can best be done by removing the outer wall of he ccecum. A window is thus made into the gut through which the opening of the ileum into the ccBcum can be seen. This aperture is a narrow

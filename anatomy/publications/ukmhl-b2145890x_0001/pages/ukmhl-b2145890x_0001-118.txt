LOWER LIMB. io6 into two twigs, which go to supply the adjacent margins of the great toe and the second toe. Deep Fascia.—The fatty superficial fascia must ^w be removed, so that the dissector may obtain a view of the deep fascia. It is convenient to study it in the peroneal region at the same time. The deep fascia is not equally dense throughout. Note its great strength in its upper part, and how it thins lower down. On the dorsum of the foot it is so exceed- ingly fine that it can scarcely be said to exist. The reason of its great strength in the upper part of the leg is readily explained. At this point it gives origin to subjacent muscles, and here also it receives fibres from a number of the tendons in relation to the knee-joint—viz., from the vasti anteriorly, from the biceps externally, and from the expanded tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus internally. As it passes over the ankle-joint it forms two thick- ened '-ands in front of the joint, and a third upon the oute spect of the joint. These are the anteiHor and exter al annular ligaments. The anterior annular ligament will be observed to consist of an tipper and a lower part. The former stretches between the tibia and fibula immediately above the ankle-joint. The lower portion is attached externally to the outer surface of the os calcis and internally to the internal malleolus and plantar fascia. Its outer attachment is narrow and strong; its inner end is expanded and weak. The external annular ligament is short and narrow,

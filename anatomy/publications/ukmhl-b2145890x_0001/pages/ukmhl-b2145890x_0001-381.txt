INTESTINAL CANAL. —The student has noticed that externally no dis- tinction can be drawn between the jejunum and ileum, with this one exception—viz., that as the tube descends it diminishes slightly in its calibre and in the thickness of its walls. It is necessary, therefore, that he should open it up, with the view of determining what differences exist internally. The best way to do this is to tie a ligature around the lower cut end of the ileum, and fill the gut as full as possible with water. The scissors can now be easily carried along the line of the mesenteric attachment, and the intestine slit open in its entire length.* The valvtilcB conniventes are the most conspicuous objects on the inner wall of the small intestine. These are crescentic folds of the mucous membrane placed transversely to the long axis of the gut, and extending from one-third to two-thirds of the distance around the tube. Note particularly that they are permanent folds, and that no amount of stretching or distension of the walls will cause their obliteration. In the upper ■part of the jejunum the valvulae conniventes are strongly developed, and placed so closely together that the intervals between them are hardly greater than the thickness of one of the folds. As we follow them down, however, they gradually diminish m numbers, become more widely separated and not nearly so prominent. Approaching the middle of the ileum, they become exceedingly sparse and Bol-^"°^' "Directory to the Dissection of the Human rnrT^' 1 ""f ' ^ "'^^""^ Suggestion.

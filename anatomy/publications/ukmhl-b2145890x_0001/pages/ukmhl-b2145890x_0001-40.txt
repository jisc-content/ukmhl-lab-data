The deep fascia may be reHected by making an incision through it along the middle line of the arm. In , throwing the mner portion inwards, the dissector must leave the bicipital fascia in position. This may be done by separatmg it artificially from the general aponeurosis by an incision above and below it. It will be afterwards seen to intervene between the median basilic vein and the Fig. 3.

The position and extent of the exier7ial and internal intermuscular septa of the arm can now be seen, and the dissector should note how they divide the upper arm into an anterior and pos- terior osteo-fascial compartment.

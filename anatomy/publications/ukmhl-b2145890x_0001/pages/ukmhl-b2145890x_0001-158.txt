146 THORAX. whilst in the case of the four lower spaces they come from the outer of its two terminal branchesâ€”viz., the musculo-phrenic. The intercostal vessels are distributed between the two muscular strata. From the angles of the ribs onwards to a point midway between the spine and sternum, the aortic intercostals lie under shelter of the lower margins of the ribs which bound the spaces superiorly, and at a higher level than the corre- sponding nerves. Here each divides into two branches, and these pass forwards in relation to the upper and lower margins of the intercostal space. They give off small branches which accompany the lateral cut- aneous nerves. The superior intercostal arteries are disposed in a similar manner. The anterior inter- costal arteries at their origin lie under cover of the internal intercostal muscles, but they soon pierce these and run outwards in relation to the upper and lower margins of each space. They end by anastomos- ing with the aortic and superior intercostal arteries. The dissector should next proceed to remove the intercostal muscles. This dissection must be carried out with more than usual care, because immediately subjacent to the internal intercostal muscles, over the greater extent of the chest, is the delicate pleural membrane lining the inner surface of the costal arches. upon no account detach this membrane from the deep surface of the ribs. On the front of the chest the ijtternal mammary artery and the triangtdaris sterni muscle will be seen to intervene between the pleura and the costal cartil-

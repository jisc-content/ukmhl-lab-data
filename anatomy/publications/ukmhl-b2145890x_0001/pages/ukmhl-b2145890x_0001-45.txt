BACK OF THE UPPER ARM. 33 Triceps Muscle.â€”To place this muscle on the stretch the scapula must be extended, and the forearm flexed at the elbow-joint. The three heads can now be cleaned and isolated from each other. Observe how the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery disappear from view between the inner and outer heads. By thrusting the little finger or the handle of the scalpel along the musculo-spiral groove on the back of the humerus, the strong tendinous fibres which bridge over the groove and protect the nerve and artery may be demonstrated. These fibres are derived from the external head of the muscle. Now divide the external head and expose the musculo-spiral groove. It will be seen that no fibres arise from this. The external head arises above and external to it, and the internal head takes origin below and internal to it. But further, the musculo-spiral nerve will be observed to pass forwards through the external intermuscular septum, and the superior profunda artery to divide into two branches, of which one accompanies the nerve and passes down in relation to the anterior surface of the intermuscular septum, whilst the other continues its course behind the intermuscular septum. The branches of the musculo-spiral nerve to the triceps muscle must be cleaned. A long slender branch which passes downwards, and which seems to end in the triceps, may be followed downwards to the anconeus muscle. The external cutaneous branches will be seen arising close to the external intermuscular septum. The ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries must be traced in their course downwards D

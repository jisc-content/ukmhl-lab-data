ABDOMEN. 210 The Common Iliac Arteries.—The two terminal branches of the aorta should next be examined. They arise upon the left side of the body of fourth lumbar vertebra and, diverging from each other, proceed downwards and outwards upon the vertebral column. After a course of about two inches, each vessel ends opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation by dividing into the exter7ial and internal iliac arteries ; of these the former is the larger of the two and appears to be the continuation of the parent trunk, whilst the latter passes downwards into the pelvis. The common iliac arteiy of each side is covered by peritoneum, and overlapped by coils of the small intestine; furthermore, it is crossed by the large sympathetic twigs which connect the aortic and hypo- gastric plexuses and, close to its termination, by the ureter. But the artery of the left side has other structures in relation to it anteriorly—viz., the rectum and the superior haemorrhoidal artery, both of which pass down in front of it. The position of the corresponding veins should be carefully noted. This differs on the two sides of the body. The left common iliac vein is in relation to both arteries. It first lies along the inner or right side of its companion artery, and then crosses behind the upper part of the right artery to reach the vena cava inferior. The right common iliac vein at first lies behind its com- panion artery, but, as it ascends, it gradually comes to lie upon its right side, and here it joins the vena cava. No collateral branches of any consequence proceed from the common iliac artery.

ABDOMEN. 26o Branches of the Internal Ihac—The branches of this artery spring from the two divisions into which it divides, and may be tabulated thus :— Anterior Division. Posterior Division. Parietal. Visceral. Parietal. Visceral. (i.) Obturator, (i.) Superior vesical. (i.) Ilio-lum- bar. (2.) Internal pudic. (2.) Inferior vesical. (2.) Gluteal. (3.) Sciatic. (3.) Middle hsemor- rhoidal. (3.) Lateral sacral. Superior Vesical.—Under this name are included two or three small twigs which spring from the pervious part of the obliterated hypogastric artery, and proceed forwards in the posterior false ligament of the bladder to the coats of that viscus. They supply the summit and the greater part of the body of the bladder, and from one of them a minute twig, the artery to the vas deferens^ is given to the seminal duct. Although exceedingly slender, this branch can be followed along the vas as far as the testicle. Inferior Vesical.—This artery will be recognised from its distribution. It ramifies upon the base of the bladder, and sends twigs to the vesiculse seminales. A branch called the vesico-prostatic also takes origin from the inferior vesical, and runs downwards upon

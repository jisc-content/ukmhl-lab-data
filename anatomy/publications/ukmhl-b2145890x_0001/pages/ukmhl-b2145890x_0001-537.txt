FEMALE PELVIS. 311 therefore, it appears simply as a transverse or longi- tudinal slit according to the direction in which it is divided (Figs. 52 and 56). Posteriorly, the upper end of the vagina is in relation to the bottom of the recto-vaginal pouch of peritoneum. Below this it is in apposition with the second part of the rectum, the recto-vaginal layer of pelvic fascia intervening. Still lower down, it is separated from the third part of the rectum by an angular interval. Anteriorly, it is related to the base of the bladder and to the urethra—indeed, the latter may almost be said to be embedded in its wall. Upon each side of the vagina, the levator ani muscle descends and gives it support, whilst its lower end is embraced by the sphincter vaginae. Ovaries.—The ovaries are two small solid bodies contained within the posterior secondary folds of the the broad ligaments. Each ovary is oval or oblong in figure, slightly compressed from above downwards, and having a size little greater than that of a pigeon's egg. The superior and inferior surfaces, with the pos- terior border, are free. The inner end is joined to the uterus by a round cord-like structure called the liga- ment of the ovary, whilst the outer end is attached to the wide mouth of the Fallopian tube by one of the fimbria. The anterior border is thinner and straighter than the posterior border, and is frequently termed the hilus, because the vessels and nerves enter and leave the organ along its whole length. Before puberty the surface of the ovary is smooth

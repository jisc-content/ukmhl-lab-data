ABDOMEN. 110 which it in reality is, and pass inwards 171 front of the ring, and then descend along its inner margin. In this case, the ring is surrounded on all sides, except posteriorly, by vessels. (2.) It may run downwards between the ring and the external iliac vein. Internal to the crural sheath the passage of a hernial protrusion behind Poupart's ligament is effectually prevented by Gimber- nat's ligament. Femoral hernia is most common in females, and inguinal hernia in males ; and for the very evident reason, that in the female the crural canal is relatively larger, whilst in the male the passage of the spermatic cord weakens the inguinal region more than the passage of the small round ligament of the uterus. Umbilical Hernia.—Very little need be said regarding this form of hernia. In the foetus and infant the protrusion emerges through the umbilical orifice; in the adult, it usually pushes its way through the linea alba close to the umbilicus. The Penis—The penis has already,to a certain ex- tent, been studied in the dissection of the perineum (p. 17). It has been seen to be composed of the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum. Posteriorly, the corpora cavernosa separate from each other, become tapered and are attached to the sides of the pubic arch under the name of the crura penis ; anteriorly, they together form a blunt rounded extremity, which is covered by the glans penis. The corpus spongiosum, when traced backwards into the perineum, expands into the bulb of the penis, which is attached, in the mesial plane, to the anterior aspect of the triangular ligament; traced forwards to the extremity of the penis, it is again found to expand into the glans penis, which fits like a cap upon the rounded ends of the corpora cavernosa. The glans penis is somewhat conical in shape, and the projecting margin of its base is termed the corona glandis. The urethra opens at

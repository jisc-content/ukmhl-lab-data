38 ABDOMEN. of its containing the apertures of the urethra and vagina. Within this fissure, and a Httle way in front of the posterior commissure, a slightly marked trans- verse ridge or fold of mucous membrane will be observed passing between the two labia majora. This fold receives the name of the ^^fourchette'' or -frenulum pudendir whilst the term navicularis \s applied to the interval between it and the posterior commissure. The fourchette is usually ruptured in first labours. It may be well for the student to bear in mind that the term " perineum " in the language of the accoucheur is used in a very restricted sense. It is given to the narrow interval which exists between the anus and the posterior commissure. The Labia Minora or Nymphse represent the male prepuce. They are two pendulous folds of mucous membrane which lie within the labia majora. To dis- play them fully the labia majora must be pulled apart. They are placed one on each side of the vaginal orifice, and commence midway between the two commissures. As they proceed forwards they become more promi- nent, and at the same time converge so as to approxi- mate to each other more closely. Reaching the clitoris, each terminates by spHtting into two divisions or folds. The smaller and lower fold is attached to the under surface of the clitoris, and receives the name of - frenulum clitoridisV The upper fold arches over the clitoris like a hood, and unites with the corresponding fold of the opposite side to form the preputium clitor- idis.

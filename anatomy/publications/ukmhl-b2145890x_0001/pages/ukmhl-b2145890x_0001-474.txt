248 ABDOMEN. When the vesical layer of fascia is divided, a plexus of large veins will be discovered upon the bladder. These veins ramify over the entire organ, but are especially numerous towards the base and in the angle between the vesical and recto-vesical layers of pelvic fascia. These veins constitute what is termed the vesical plexus. The vesicul^ seminales must be carefully defined, and the obliterated hypogastric artery and the vas deferens followed upon the side of the bladder. Pelvic Viscera. Rectum.â€”This is the terminal part of the great intestine. It begins at the left sacro-iliac articulation, where it is continuous with the sigmoid flexure, and ends on the surface a short distance in front of the coccyx, in an orifice termed the anus. Its length is about eight inches, and although its walls are no longer sacculated and pouched like those of the colon, it does not present a uniform diameter throughout. At first its calibre corresponds with that of the lower part of the colon, but as if descends, it gradually dilates. Immediately above its termination, it presents a wide expansion, and then contracts to form the anus. In its course through the pelvis, the rectum is adapted to the concave anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and is commonly divided, from changes in its direction and connections, into three parts. This subdivision is purely arbitrary, and merely adopted for the purpose of rendering the description more exact.

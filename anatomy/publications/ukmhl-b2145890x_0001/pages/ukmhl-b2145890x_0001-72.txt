LOWER LIMB. 6o The tuber ischii, and the great trochanter are now exposed to view, and a bursa in connection with each may be demonstrated. That in relation to the great trochanter is of very large size, and is directly inter- posed between the muscle and the external surface of the bone. Open it with the knife, and estimate its extent by introducing the finger. Note the thinness of its walls, and further, that it usually consists of one sac. Next examine in a similar manner the bursa in connection with the tuber ischii. It will be found upon the inferior aspect of this prominence, and the dissector will not fail to observe that it lies more between the tough superficial fascia and bone, than between the muscle and bone. A third bursa will be found intervening between the vastus externus and the gluteus maximus. The insertion of the gluteus maximus can now be demonstrated in a satisfactory manner. In the next place define and clean the muscles, blood-vessels, and nerves, by removing the loose areolar tissue which clothes and passes in between them. The following muscles will be recognised as we pass from above downwards :â€”(i.) The gluteus medius ; (2.) The pyriformis, issuing from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen; (3.) The tendon of the obturator internus, with the gemellus superior attached to its upper border, and the gemellus inferior to its lower border; (4.) The quadratus femoris; (5.) The upper border of the adductor magnus. By separating the quadratus from the gemellus inferior, the tendon of the obturator

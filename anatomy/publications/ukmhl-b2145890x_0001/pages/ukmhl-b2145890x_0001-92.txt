So LOWER LIMB. below Poupart's ligament. A thin fascia, called the cribriform fascia, is spread over the opening and hides it from view. This fascia has received the name of " cribriform " because it is pierced by the saphena vein and by numerous lymphatic vessels. Some difference of opinion exists as to what this fascia really is. It is regarded by many as being a part of the superficial fascia, but it is more correct to look upon it as being a thin layer of fascia lata carried over the opening, or in other words a prolongation inwards of the outer margin of the opening. To define the saphenous opening the dissector should commence by cautiously removing the superficial fascia from the fascia lata over the upper parts of the adductor longus and pectineus muscles. The deep fascia at this point is called the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and as it is cleaned, from within outwards, it will be observed to recede gradually from the surface and to be continued behind the femoral sheath. The clearly-defined inferior cornu of the saphenous opening will now be brought into view, curving under the internal saphenous vein, and blend- ing with the pubic fascia. The cribriform fascia must now be removed so as to display the outer boundary of the opening. To a certain extent this dissection is artificial, seeing that the cribriform fascia is merely a continuation inwards of the outer lip of the opening. The outer boundary is usually very much broken up by the superficial branches of the femoral artery which pierce it, and its definition is a matter of some difficulty. In a spare subject, however, the line of

ABDOMEN. 222 The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh emerges from the outer border of the psoas about its middle, and descends obliquely across the iliacus muscle to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. At this point it leaves the abdomen by passing behind Poupart's ligament. It supplies the skin upon the outer aspect of the thigh. The anterior crural nerve is the largest branch of the plexus. It runs downwards in the interval between the psoas and iliacus, and passes from the abdomen behind Poupart's ligament. It will be observed to give twigs to the iliacus muscle, and a branch to the upper part of the femoral artery. The obturator nerve emerges from the inner border of the psoas, and extends forwards upon the inner wall of the pelvis a short way below the brim. At the upper part of the thyroid foramen it joins the artery of the same name, and escaping from the pelvis, enters the thigh.* Lumbo-sacral Cord.â€”This large nervous trunk- is formed by the union of the anterior primary division of the fifth lumbar nerve with a branch from the fourth lumbar nerve. It passes downwards over the base of the sacrum into the pelvis, joins the sacral plexus, and gives off the superior gluteal nerve. * A small nerve, the accessory obturator, is occasionally to be found. It may either spring directly from the obturator or from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It proceeds downwards along the inner side of the psoas, and it enters the thigh by passing over the pubic bone under cover of the pectineus. Here it gives branches to the hip joint and to the pectineus, and communicates with the obturator nerve.

PELVIC NERVES. 273 side are sent along the various branches of the internal iliac artery. There are thus formed various secondary plexuses—viz., the vesical plexus, to the coats of the bladder, to the seminal vesicle and the vas deferens ; the hcEmorrhoidal plexus to the rectum; and the prostatic plexus to the prostate. The prostatic plexus proceeds forwards between the prostate and the levator ani, and sends twigs to the erectile tissue of the penis. These latter are termed the cavernous nerves. GangHated Cord of Sympathetic—The sym- pathetic cord as it enters the pelvis is considerably reduced in size. It proceeds downwards in front of the sacrum, along the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina. Above, it is continuous with the lumbar portion of the sympathetic cord, whilst below, it ends in the mesial plane in front of the coccyx in a minute ganglion, termed the ganglion impar, which acts as a bond of union between the cords of the two sides. The ganglia are very variable in number, but as a general rule there are five—one in relation to each sacral vertebra. Each of these is brought into connection with the spinal nerves by two short twigs.. The branches of these ganglia are chiefly distri- buted upon the anterior surface of the sacrum and around the middle sacral artery. A few filaments, however, are given to the hypogastric plexus, and some minute twigs proceed from the ganglion impar to the parts about the coccyx and to the coccygeal body. PART II. ^

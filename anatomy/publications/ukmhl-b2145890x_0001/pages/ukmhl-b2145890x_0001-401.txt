SOLAR PLEXUS. ganglia and surrounds the coeliac axis is called the coeliac plexus. To the outer side of each ganglion the plexus ends in numerous branches for the suprarenal body and kidney, and these are classified under the terms of suprarenal and renal plexuses. Inferiorly, the plexus has already been seen to send downwards two large offshoots to accompany the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery; these are the aortic and superior mesenteric plexuses. Lastly, a small offset from the upper part of each semi-lunar ganglion is termed the diaphragmatic plexus. Semi-lunar Ganglia.—These are so large that they are usually mistaken by students for lymphatic glands. The ganglion of the right side is placed under cover of the vena cava inferior, and both lie in close relation to the coeliac axis. When thoroughly defined, they will be observed to be of a very irregular shape, and to show little of the outline from which their name is derived. The upper extremity of each ganglion is joined by great splanchnic nerve. The Coeliac Plexus.—This plexus of nerves connects the two semi-lunar ganglia with each other, and sur- rounds the coeliac axis so closely that it almost com- pletely hides its trunk from view. It is reinforced by twigs from the right vagus and is joined by the small or second splanchnic nerve. Three secondary plexuses —viz., the coronary, the hepatic, and the splenic—take origin from the coeliac plexus. The coronary plexus accompanies the artery of the same name along the lesser curvature of the

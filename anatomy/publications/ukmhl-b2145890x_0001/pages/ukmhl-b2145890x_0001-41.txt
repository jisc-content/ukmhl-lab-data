FRONT OF THE UPPER ARM. 2^ Brachial Artery—Nerves of Upper Arm.—Before the muscles are disturbed the brachial artery and its branches should be followed out. The venae comites, which lie one on either side of the vessel, render this dissection somewhat, tedious. A short distance below the bend of the elbow the artery ends by dividing into the radial and ulnar arteries. With the excep- tion of the musculo-cutaneous, all the nerves of the arm will be seen to lie for a certain part of their course in relation to the vessel. The median nerve lies at first along its outer side; at the middle of the arm it crosses the artery, and then it continues down upon its inner side. The ulnar and internal cutaneous lie close to its inner side, as far as the inser- tion of the coraco-brachialis, and they then leave the artery. The former inclines backwards, and piercing the internal intermuscular septum, it enters the poste- rior compartment of the arm. The internal cutaneous nerve, on the other hand, inclines forwards, and piercing the deep fascia, becomes superficial. The musculo-spiral lies for a short distance behind the brachial artery, but it soon leaves it, and passes back- wards and downwards between the outer and inner heads of the triceps. Do not trace it further at present. The median and ulnar nerves give off no branches in the upper arm. Now clean the branches of the brachial artery. From the outer side of the vessel spring the muscular twigs; from the inner side the superior profunda, the inferior profunda, the nutrient, and the anas- tomotica magna proceed. The superior profunda

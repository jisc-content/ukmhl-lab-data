254 ABDOMEN. and 45, p. 245. This capsule prevents the prostate altering its position in response to the continual changes in the state of distention of the bladder. Prostate Plexus of Veins.—O^^n into the capsule and lay bare the prostate. It will be found to be surrounded, particularly towards the base, by a dense network of veins. The dorsal vein of the penis passes backwards in relation to the upper surface of the prostate, and, after dividing into two, joins this plexus. Constitution of the Prostate—Two median grooves, one upon its anterior or pubic surface, and the other upon its posterior or rectal surface, indicate the subdivision of the prostate into two lateral lobes. This is further marked by a median notch in the posterior aspect of the base. A third or middle lobe is also present. It is a small piece interposed between the lateral lobes on the one hand, and the posterior aspect of the neck of the bladder and first part of the urethra on the other. Relations of the Prostate.—Anteriorly, the pros- tate is in relation to the pubo-prostatic ligaments and the dorsal vein of the penis; posteriorly, it rests upon the rectum ; laterally, it is supported by the anterior fibres of the levator ani, which, from this relation, receive the name of levator prostates; inferiorly, the urethra emerges from its apex; whilst superiorly, its base embraces the neck of the bladder, and the common ejaculatory ducts are received into the interval between its middle and lateral lobes.

ABDOMINAL WALL. 53 The student should now place his finger upon the upper part of the symphysis pubis and carry.it outwards, over the pubic crest, to the pubic spine; from this he should follow the line of Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and, having identi- fied these parts, let him next endeavour to determine the position of the external abdominal ring. This is easily done in a male subject. Immediately external to the spine of the os pubis the spermatic cord can be felt as it passes over Poupart's ligament to reach the scrotum. Taking this as a guide, push the loose skin of the scrotum upwards before the finger. The tip of the finger enters the opening, the sharp margins of which can now be felt. In females who have borne children the skin over the lower part of the abdomen is wrinkled and scarred. A dissection of the abdominal wall will display the following parts :â€” (i.) Superficial fascia. (2.) Cutaneous vessels and nerves. (3.) The external oblique muscle. (4.) The internal oblique muscle. (5.) The lower six intercostal nerves and accompanying vessels; the ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric nerves. (6.) The transversalis muscle. (7.) The rectus and pyramidalis muscles and the sheath of the rectus, (8.) The transversalis fascia. ^ (9-) The deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac arteries.

Il8 LOWER LIMB. popliteal vein. It should now be displayed in its whole length by tracing it upwards upon the back of the leg. Associated with each of these veins are certain superficial nerves, and these must be displayed at the same time. The small sciatic is closely related to the external saphenous vein in its upper part, and the external saphenous nerve accompanies it in the lower half of the leg. In company with the internal saphe- nous vein we find 'di^ internal saphenous nerve. Cutaneous Nerves.—These are very numerous. On the inner side of the leg look for—(i.) the internal saphenous ; (2.) the inner branch of the internal cutan- eous ; and (3.) the internal calcanear. The guide to the internal saphenous nerve is the vein of the same name. These two structures lie in close relation to each other. The internal cutaneous is found passing down a short distance behind the former. It usually ends about the middle of the leg. The internal calcanear is a branch of the posterior tibial nerve. Dissect for it in the interval between the prominence of the heel and internal malleolus. It pierces the internal annular ligament nearer the former than the latter. Its distribution to the skin of the heel and sole will be seen in a future dissection. In the middle line of the leg two nerves will be found, viz.,(i.) smallsciatic,^xi^{2?) the nervuscommmiicans tibialis. They both lie in relation to the external saphenous nerve, and they have both been previously seen in the dissection of the popliteal space. The

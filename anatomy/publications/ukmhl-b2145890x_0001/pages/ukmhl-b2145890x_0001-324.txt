100 ABDOMEN. may be studied, and also the manner in which the testicle is clothed by the visceral layer. The testicle is an oval body, with flattened sides. The posterior border is also somewhat flattened, and here we see the epididymis. This is an elongated and arched structure, which is adapted to the upper end and outer side of the posterior border of the testicle. Its upper end is enlarged, and is termed the globus major; its lower end is called the globus minor, and the intervening portion, which is narrow, receives the name of the body of the epididymis. The globus major is directly attached to the upper end of the testicle, which it surmounts like a helmet, by the vasa efferentia, which pass from the one into the other. The globus minor is merely fixed to the back of the testicle by areolar tissue, whilst the body is free. The vas deferens emerges from the lower end of the globus minor, and then passes upwards upon the posterior border of the testicle and to the inner side of the epididymis. By this relation, the side to which a given testicle belongs can be readily detected. The vessels have already been seen entering the posterior border of the testicle. Having learned these points concerning the testicle, the student is in a position to trace the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis upon its surface. Observe that it envelopes it closely on every side, with the ex- ception of the posterior border, where the vessels enter. The posterior aspect of the epididymis is also, to a certain extent, left bare. Follow it backwards over the outer surface of the organ, and it will be seen

ABDOMEN. 26 anterior layer or triangular ligament we have seen to be in the same morphological plane as the bony wall of the pelvis and the thyroid membrane, and, in fact, to complete the pelvic wall in front. Tho:posterior layer is simply the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia carried round to the front of the pelvis. Consequently the con- nections of this layer can be examined very much better in conjunction with the pelvic fascia. Suffice it for the present to say that inferiorly it is blended with the base of the triangular ligament, but that it recedes from the surface as it passes upwards, so that a space or interval is left between the two aponeurotic strata. Contained within this interval are the following structures :—• (i.) The membranous portion of the urethra. (2.) The dorsal vein of the penis. (3.) The compressor urethrse muscles. (4.) Cowper's glands. (5.) The pudic vessels and nerves and the artery to the bulb. To expose these parts, the anterior layer of the triangular ligament must be raised upon one side of the body. It should be carefully preserved upon the opposite side, for in the subsequent dissection of the pelvis it is required as a landmark. On the side selected detach the ligament from the margin of the pubic arch, and, cautiously raising it from the subjacent structures, throw it inwards towards the bulb. Membranous Portion of the Urethra.—The canal of the urethra is subdivided for descriptive purposes into three parts, according to the structures which are in relation to its walls as it passes from the

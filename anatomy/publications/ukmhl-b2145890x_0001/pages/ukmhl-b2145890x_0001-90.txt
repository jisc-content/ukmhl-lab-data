78 LOWER LIMB. far as Poupart's ligament. Here it will be found that the fingers can force their way no farther. The passage of the hand into the thigh is barred by the attachment of the deep surface of the superficial fascia to the fascia lata. In the superficiar fascia blood-vessels, glands, lym- phatic vessels, and nerves are embedded, and these must now be dissected out. Internal Saphenous Vein.—First look for this large vein. It will be found extending up the thigh a little way internal to the middle line of the limb. Trace it upwards till it reaches a point about two inches from Poupart's ligament. At this point it dips through the deep fascia, and joins the femoral vein. It is not desirable to define the opening in the fascia lata through which it passes, until a later stage of the dissection. Several tributaries join the internal saphenous vein at this point, and these should be dissected along with the small superficial arteries which accompany them. They are—(i.) The super- ficial pudic ; (2.) The superficial epigastric ; and (3.) The superficial circumflex iliac veins. Arteries.—The superficial pudic will be found run- ning upwards and inwards over the spermatic cord ; the superficial epigastric courses upwards and leaves the thigh by crossing Poupart's ligament about its middle ; the superficial circumflex iliac runs upwards and outwards along Poupart's ligament, to the anterior superior iliac spine. They are all branches of the femoral artery.

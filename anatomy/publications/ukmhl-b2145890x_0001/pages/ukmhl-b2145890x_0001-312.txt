88 ABDOMEN. formation of the anterior wall are—(i.) the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique throughout the entire extent of the canal; and (2.) the lower border of the internal oblique in the first part of the canal. These facts can be readily verified by restoring these structures to their original positions. The posterior wall next demands the attention of the student. The parts which compose it are still in situ. Naming them in order, from the inlet to the outlet, they are— (l.) the fascia transversalis ; (2.) the conjoined tendon; and (3.) the triangular fascia, when it is strongly developed. But it may be asked, Does the transversalis muscle take no part in the formation of the inguinal canal ? The student can readily satisfy himself as to this point. He will notice that the arched lower border of this muscle does not descend so low as that of the internal oblique, that, in fact, it stops short at the internal abdominal ring. It follows from this, then, that if a roof were described in connection with the canal it might be said to be formed by the approximation of the anterior and posterior walls above the cord, and by the intervention between these walls of the lower borders of the transversalis and internal oblique. There is still another point to be noted—viz., the relation which the deep epigastric artery bears to the posterior wall of the canal. This vessel can be felt ' (and, indeed, in most cases seen) extending obliquely upwards and inwards behind the transversalis fascia to the outer border of the rectus. A triangular space is thus mapped out by the artery, Poupart's ligament,

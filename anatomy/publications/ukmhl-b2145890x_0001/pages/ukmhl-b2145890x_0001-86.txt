74 LOWER LIMB. popliteal nerves. It will be found to give branches to each of the hamstrings and to the adductor magnus upon which it lies. In a few cases it may be observed to give off a long articular twig, which enters the popliteal space and accompanies the superior external articular artery. Perforating Arteriesâ€”Four perforating arteries will be found emerging from the surface of the adductor magnus muscle close to the linea aspera of the femur. They are called first, second, third, and fourth according to the level at which they appear from above downwards. The fourth is the terminal branch of the profunda artery of the thigh, and it makes its appearance about an inch above the open- ing in the muscle through which the popliteal artery enters the popliteal space. The perforating arteries and their branches must be thoroughly cleaned, but not only the arteries themselves, but also the aper- tures in the adductor magnus through which they pass. It will then be seen that they do not pierce the fleshy substance of the muscle. Prepared for each is a tendinous archway, and they reach the back of the thigh by passing between these and the linea aspera, to which the piers of the various arches are attached. These openings lie in the same line and are in all respects analogous to the large opening in the same muscle for the popliteal artery, and the result obtained is the same in both cases. When the muscle contracts, the vessels are protected from pressure. The external circumflex artery also sends a branch

MALE PERINEUM. 5 The four triangular flaps which are marked out should now be raised. The superficial fascia and the external sphincter muscle are thus exposed. Rectal Triangle. The dissection of this portion of the perineal space will disclose the following parts (Fig. 3, p. 12) :— (i.) The superficial fascia. (2.) The external sphincter ani muscle. (3.) The lower part of the rectum covered by the levator ani muscle and the anal fascia. (4.) The parietal or obturator layer of pelvic fascia. (5.) The lower border of the gluteus maximus muscle and the great sacro-sciatic ligament. (6.) The coccygeus muscle. (7.) The inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves. (8.) The perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve. (9.) The commencement of the posterior superficial perineal nerve. Superficial fascia.—The student should examine the superficial fascia as it is spread over the entire extent of the perineal space. It shows great differ- ences in character and texture in different positions. At the side of the anus it is remarkable for the large quantity of fat it holds in its meshes. This fat is soft and lobulated, and passes upwards upon each side of the rectum in the form of a pliable and elastic pad. Over the tuberosities of the ischium the superficial fascia undergoes a striking alteration. Here it becomes tough and stringy; dense fibrous septa separate the lobules of fat from each other and connect the skin

PELVIC FASCIA. 231 the bladder on to the posterior aspect of the an- terior abdominal wall. It is led away from the viscus by the urachus and the two obliterated hypo- gastric arteries. Hypogastric Nervous Plexus.—This is the lowest of the three great prevertebral plexuses, and is the main source from which the pelvic viscera are supplied with nerves. It is an exceedingly dense plexus, which lies in front of the body of the last lumbar vertebra in the interval between the two common iliac arteries. Superiorly^ it is joined by numerous large filaments, which proceed downwards from the aortic plexus and the lumbar ganglia. In- feriorly, it will afterwards be seen to end by dividing into two lateral parts termed the pelvic plexuses, but these must not be followed out at present. Pelvic Fascia.—Now is the time to study the pelvic fascia, and it is a work which will require some care and patience on the part of the dissector. Much of the difficulty which involves the study of the pelvic fascia will be removed if the student will constantly keep before him two facts regarding it, viz.—(i.) That it constitutes a lining for the inner surface of the entire pelvic wall. (2.) That it sends across the pelvic cavity a layer which acts as a partition between the pelvis proper and the perineum. The lining portion of the fascia miy be termed the parietal part, and the partition portion the visceral part. If the pelvis contained no viscera, the arrangement would be

PELVIC VISCERA. 251 stood, its form, and in a great measure its position and relations, are much influenced by the quantity of fluid which it contains. When empty, it lies entirely within the pelvic cavity, and is flattened and collapsed; further, it is somewhat triangular in form, and rests upon the symphysis and the bodies of the pubic bones. When distended, it assumes an ovoid shape, and, rising above the pubis, enters the hypogastric region of the abdomen proper. In this condition it presents for exam- ination an apex and base; an anterior, posterior, and two lateral surfaces; and a neck. The long axis of the distended bladder is directed from before back- wards, and slightly downwards, from the apex to the base.* The apex or summit of the bladder is directed for- wards, and rests upon the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall. From its centre a strong fibrous cord, the urachus, proceeds upwards in the middle line to the umbilicus.f The peritoneum gives a partial covering to the apex; it clothes it as far forwards as the urachus, which conducts it to the abdominal wall. The base of the bladder looks * In Braune's plates, the long axis of the bladder is represented as being horizontal (vide Plate i b). t This is a very interesting structure from a developmental point of view. It shows the connection which exists between the bladder and the allantoidal sac of the embryo. At an early stage of development the sac of the allantois consists of an extra-abdominal and an intra-abdo- minal portion, which communicate with each other through the umbili- . cus. In course of time the extra-abdominal part disappears. The fate of the intra-abdominal part is different; its lower portion is developed into the bladder, whilst its upper portion shrivels and becomes the urachus.

2^6 ABDOMEN. Anal Fascia.—It is necessary, before leaving the pelvic fascia, to take notice of a layer which has already been studied in connection with the perineum —viz., the anal fascia. This is a thin and delicate aponeurosis which covers the perineal or lower sur- face of the levator ani, and which is connected with the pelvic fascia along the white line. In consequence of this attachment, it is usually described as a distinct layer of the pelvic fascia, whereas it is merely the aponeurosis of the muscle. The levator ani is thus enclosed between two aponeurotic lamellae—viz., the visceral pelvic fascia and the rectal fascia above, and the anal fascia below. Relation of Blood-Vessels and Nerves to Pelvic Fascia.—The blood-vessels of the pelvis are placed on the peritoneal aspect of the fascia. It follows, therefore, that the parietal branches of the internal iliac artery, in passing out of the pelvis, pierce the mem- brane, and they always carry with them a prolongation from it which blends with their sheaths (Fig. 41, P- 240). There is an exception to this rule-viz., the obturator artery. It has been observed to pass over the upper border of the parietal pelvic fascia. The nerves, on the other hand, lie outside or behind the fascia, and do not require to pierce it in emerging from the pelvis. This difference in the relation of the nerves and blood- vessels can be well studied by looking at the fascia as it passes over the great sacro-sciatic foramen.

179 STOMACH. The muscular coat consists of involuntary or un- striped muscular fibres, and these are disposed in three layersâ€”each layer being distinguished by the direction of its fibres. The external layer is composed of longitudinal fibres. These are best seen at the curvatures and towards the pylorus. At the cardiac orifice they become continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, and at the pyloric orifice they mix with the longitudinal fibres of the duodenum. Very few longitudinal fibres can be detected on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the viscus. The middle layer is composed of circular fibres, and these constitute a uniform coating for the stomach. Very thin at the fundus, this layer becomes gradually thicker as we approach the pylorus, and, at the point where the stomach gives place to the duodenum, they are aggrcgated into a circular band, called the pyloric sphincter. The internal layer consists of oblique fibres, and only gives a partial covering to the stomach. They are continuous with the circular fibres of the gullet, and are best^seen'on the fundus of the stomach to the left of the oesophageal opening. From this they spread out upon both surfaces of the viscus, and embrace the oesophageal opening. The submucous coat is composed of loose areolar tissue. It intervenes between the muscular and mucous tunics, and binds the one to the other. The mucous coat must be studied from the inside of the stomach. Open up the viscus by running the scissors along the lesser curvature. The duodenum may be laid open at the same time. The gastric

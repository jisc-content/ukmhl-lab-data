FRONT OF THE UPPER ARM. 2$ around the bone may be made out. The posterior scapular artery in connection with the base or ver- tebral border of the scapula, the suprascapular artery in connection with the superior margin of the bone, and the subscapular and dorsalis scapula in con- nection with the axillary border, all take part m this inosculation. In addition to some branches to the venter scapulae, the dorsalis scapulae artery will be found to give off a -very constant branch, which runs down to the inferior angle of the bone between the origins of the teres major and teres minor muscles. Teres Major Muscle.—The part which this muscle plays in the formation of the quadrilateral and triangular spaces has already been seen. It only remains for the student to examine its origin and insertion. Lastly, remove the fleshy portions of the subscap- ularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres mmor muscles, leaving only a small part of each, close to their insertions, in order that they may again be examined in their relation to the shoulder-joint. FRONT OP THE UPPER ARM. In this dissection the following parts have to be studied:— (i.) Cutaneous vessels and nerves. (2.) Brachial aponeurosis. (3.) Brachial artery and its branches. (4.) Median, ulnar, musculo-spiral and musculo-cutaneous nerves, and the branches of the two last. (5.) Biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis anticus muscles.

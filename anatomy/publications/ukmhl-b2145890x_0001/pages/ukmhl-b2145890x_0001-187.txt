THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. 1/5 are confined entirely to the appendix. Everywhere else the inner surface of the walls is smooth. In the posterior wall the four openings of the pulmonary veins will be seen, and in the lower and fore part of the auricle is the oval auriculo-ventricular openings which is wide enough to admit the passage of two fingers into the ventricle. The position of the foetal foramen ovale can also be distinguished upon this side of the septum between the auricles, but it is not so well marked as it is in the right auricle. Left Ventricle.â€”To open the left ventricle the dissector should stand upon the right side of the body and grasp the heart with the left hand, so that the forefinger rests upon the upper part of the posterior interventricular furrow and the thumb upon the upper part of the anterior interventricular furrow. The wall of the ventricle should next be transfixed by a long knife. (Fig. ii.) Enter the knife below the thumb, about half-an-inch to the left of the anterior furrow, and push it through the ventricular wall towards the forefinger, so that the point emerges below this and half-an-inch to the left of the posterior furrow. Now carry the knife downwards towards the apex, but never allow it to come nearer to the furrows than it was when entered. If necessary, the cut on each side may be extended upwards towards the base of the ventricle with a small knife. When the lard injection and blood have been washed away from the interior of the left ventricle with hot water, the columnce carnecB will be observed to form

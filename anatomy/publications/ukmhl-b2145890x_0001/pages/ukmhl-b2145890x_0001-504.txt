278 ABDOMEN. The external longitudinal fibres, frequently termed the detrusor tirincE, give a continuous covering to the bladder, but are most apparent upon its anterior and posterior surfaces. In front they may be considered to spring from the back of the pubic bones and the base of the prostate. From this they mount upwards and spread out upon the anterior surface of the bladder. At the apex a few pass on to the urachus, but the majority are carried downwards over the posterior aspect and base of the bladder to the prostate, to which they are attached. The circular fibres give a very thin and sparse covering to the bladder. In direction they are more oblique than transverse. At the neck of the bladder they become greatly increased in numbers, and, arranged in a distinctly circular manner, they form a thick bundle, which is termed the sphificter vesiccs. The internal longitudinal fibres constitute a very feeble layer. Over the lower part of the bladder the stratum is tolerably complete; but, as it is followed upwards, the fibres open out and become oblique. The submucous coat is the loose areolar bed in which the blood-vessels and nerves ramify before they enter the mucous membrane. It connects the mucous and muscular coats, and has a considerable amount of elastic tissue entering into its composition. The mticous membrane which lines the bladder should now be examined, and, for this purpose, it is necessary to open up the viscus by an incision along its anterior aspect from the apex to the neck. It is better to lay open the first portion of the urethra at

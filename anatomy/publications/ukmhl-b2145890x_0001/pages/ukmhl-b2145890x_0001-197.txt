185 POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. postero-inferior aspect a slender muscular slip may, in some cases, be observed to take origin. This fasciculus connects it with the oesophagus, and is' therefore called the broncJio-mophageal muscle. The relations of the bronchi in the roots of the lungs have already been studied {vide p. 158). Posterior Mediastinum.—This is the term which is applied to that portion of the interpleural space which lies between the pericardium and the bodies of the vertebrse. The following is a list of the structures which it contains :— (i.) The thoracic aorta. (2.) The oesophagus. (3.) The pneumogastric nerves. (4.) The thoracic duct. (5.) The vena azygos major. (6.) The vena azygos minor superior. (7.) The vena azygos minor inferior. (8.) The great splanchnic nerves. (9.) Some lymphatic glands. To open into the space it is necessary to make a vertical incision through the pericardium, which forms its anterior wall. Carry the knife along the line of the cesophagus, and throw the pericardium outwards and inwards. If this be done with care, a fleshy band may, in some cases, be observed crossing the superficial aspect of the thoracic aorta, and extending from the oesophagus to the pleura, which forms the left lateral wall of the posterior mediastinal space. This is the pleuro-cesophageal muscle. In the majority of cases, however, this muscle is only represented by a few

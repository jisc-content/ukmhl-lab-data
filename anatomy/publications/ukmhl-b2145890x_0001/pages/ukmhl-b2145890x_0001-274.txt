50 ABDOMEN. The Vagina will be fully described in connection with the pelvic viscera. Barthohn's Glands.—These glands are the re- presentatives in the female of Cowper's glands in the male. They are two round or oblong bodies about the size of a horse-bean, placed one upon each side of the entrance to the vagina immediately behind the rounded end of the bulb, and under cover of the triangular ligament. A long duct proceeds from each gland, and opens on the inner aspect of the vaginal orifice external to the hymen. Internal Pudic Vessels and Nerve.—The internal pudic vessels and nerve have a precisely similar disposition to the corresponding vessels and nerve in the male (p. 29). If anything, they are somewhat smaller. The student must therefore look for the artery to the bulb, a branch of the internal pudic, which in this case is given to the bulb of the vagina, and the two terminal branches of the internal pudic artery—viz., the dorsal artery of the clitoris, and the artery to the corpus cavernosum. The internal pudic nerve ends by dividing into the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The perineal nerve gives off—(i.) the anterior and posterior superficial perineal branches to the skin covering the labium majus ; (2.) muscular twigs to all the perineal muscles, and (3.) a branch to the bulb of the vagina. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris gives a twig to the

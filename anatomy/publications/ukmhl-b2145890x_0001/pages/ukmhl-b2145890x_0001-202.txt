The branches of the thoracic aorta may be grouped under the heads of visceral and parietal. !Bronchial. Pericardiac. CEsophageal. Posterior Mediastinal. Parietal. | Intercostal (nine on each side). The bro7ichial arteries are usually three in number â€”tivo for the left lung and one for the right lung. They are very variable in their manner of origin. The right bronchial artery often springs from the first aortic intercostal arteiy. They run upon the posterior aspect of the corresponding bronchus, and they have already been studied as constituent parts of the roots of the lungs. The pericardiac branches are some minute twigs which are distributed to the posterior aspect of the pericardium. The oesophageal arteries are the vessels of supply to the gullet. They are four or five in number, and are irregularly placed. They spring from the front or right side of the aorta, and form a chain of anastomoses on the wall of the oesophagus. Above, this chain communicates with branches of the inferior thyroid artery, whilst below it communicates with the ascending branches of the coronary artery of the stomach. posterior medias- tinal branches are very small, and are given to the

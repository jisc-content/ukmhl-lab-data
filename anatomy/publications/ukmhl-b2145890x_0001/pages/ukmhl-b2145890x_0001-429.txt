203 THE DIAPHRAGM. 'J already pointed out (p. 122). The abdominal surface of the diaphragm is almost completely clothed by peritoneum. The only part of any extent left uncovered is that portion which is in relation to the bare area on the posterior border of the liver. The thoracic surface is clothed in the middle by the fibrous pericar- dium, and on each side by the pleura. A limited portion of the circumference, however, is bare, and this in apposition anteriorly with the triangularis sterni muscle, and laterally with the internal inter- costal muscles and costal arches. The Nerves and Blood-Vessels of the Dia- phragm.—The diaphragm draws its arterial and nervous supply from the following sources, viz.:— (i.) The phrenic nerves. (2.) Twigs from the lower five or six intercostal Nerves. { nerves. (3.) The diaphragmatic plexuses, offshoots from the solar plexuses. (i.) The inferior phrenic arteries. (2.) The accompanying arteries of the phrenic nerves. (3.) The musculo-phrenic arteries. (4.) Twigs from the lower intercostal arteries. (5.) Twigs from the upper lumbar arteries. Vessels on the Posterior Wall of the Abdomen. The abdominal aorta and its branches and the vena cava must now be cleaned. In doing this, care should be taken of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic which extends downwards on each side Arteries.

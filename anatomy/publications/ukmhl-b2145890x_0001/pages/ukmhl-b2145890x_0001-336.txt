112 ABDOMEN. Dorsal Vessels and Nerves.â€”On the dorsum of the penis, in the groove which extends along the middle line between the two corpora cavernosa, is the dorsal vein ; on each side of this is the dorsal artery, and superficial and external to the artery is the dorsal nerve. On the dorsum of the penis, therefore, we find one vein, two arteries, and two nerves. The dorsal vein of the penis begins by several twigs from the glans and prepuce. It extends backwards in the middle line, and disappearing between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, pierces the triangular ligament midway between the symphysis pubis and the urethra. Reaching the pelvis, it joins the prostatic plexus of veins. ..-^b^^^ The dorsal arteries are the terminal twigs of the internal pudic .vessels. Piercing the triangular liga- ment, thefj^ forward between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, and continuing their course on the dorsum of the penis, they terminate in branches for the glans penis. The dorsal nerves are branches of the internal pudic. They-have a similar course to the arteries, and end in fine twigs to the papillae of the glans. ABDOMINAL CAVITY. The abdominal cavity may now be opened com- pletely by carrying an incision from the umbilicus upwards to the ensiform cartilage. On throwing the two flaps thus formed upwards and outwards over the lower margin of the thorax, a strong fibrous cord,

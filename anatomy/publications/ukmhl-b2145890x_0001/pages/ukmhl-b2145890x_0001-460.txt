234 ABDOMEN. which the visceral layer leaves the parietal layer—and here he must stop. In the dissection of the ischio-rectal fossa (p. 9), the parietal pelvic fascia was exposed and recognised as forming the outer wall of the space. The entire inner surface of the parietal portion, both in its pelvic and perineal parts, is, therefore, now exposed, and, if the levator ani be drawn outwards and the pelvis held up to the light, the visceral pelvic fascia will be seen passing inwards from the parietal part to the viscera. But it is also necessary to obtain a view of the outer aspect of the parietal pelvic fascia, and, for this pur- pose, the following dissection must be made. Dissection from the Side.—To reach the pelvic fascia from this aspect a portion of the bony wall of the pelvis must be removed, and the obturator internus muscle raised from its position. The outer aspect of the innominate bone must first be thoroughly cleaned by removing the remains of the obturator externus muscle and all adhering portions of muscle from the pubic and ischial bones ; carefully preserve, however, the obtura- tor nerve and artery as they emerge from the upper part of the thyroid foramen. The membrane which closes the thyroid foramen may also be taken away. This will expose a part of the outer surface of the obturator internus muscle. Next, define the great and small sacro-sciatic foramina and the structures which emerge from and enter the pelvis through these aper- tures. The section of the bone may now be made. This

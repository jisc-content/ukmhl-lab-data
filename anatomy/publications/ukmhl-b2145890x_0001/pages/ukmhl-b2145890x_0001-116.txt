104 LOWER LIMB. Reflection of Skin.—The skin should be reflected from the tibial and peroneal regions at the same time. Incisions :—{\') A vertical cut along the middle line of the leg and dorsum of the foot to. the base of the middle toe; (2.) A transverse incision across the ankle-joint; (3.) A transverse incision across the dorsum of the foot at the roots of the toes. The four flaps of skin thus mapped out must now, be raised from the subjacent fatty tissue, and the superficial veins and nerves dissected out. Superficial Veins.—The vejious arch on the dorsum of the foot, which receives the digital veins, should in the first place be dissected. From the inner extremity of this arch the internal saphenous vein will be seen to take origin, whilst from its outer end the external saphenous vein proceeds. Trace these vessels upwards. The former will be found to pass in front of the internal malleolus, whilst the latter ascends behind the external malleolus. Each is associated with the nerve which bears its own name. Cutaneous Nerves.—The following are the cuta- neous nerves which must be secured in this dissec- tion :— (i.) Branches from the external popliteal. (2.) External saphenous. • (3.) Internal saphenous. (4.) Musculo-cutaneous. (5.) Anterior tibial. The twigs from the external popliteal are very minute, and are distributed upon the outer aspect of

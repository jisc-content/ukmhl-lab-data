64 ABDOMEN. External Abdominal Ring (Fig. 8).—In the male, the aponeurosis of the external oblique is pierced immediately above the pubes by the spermatic cord ; and in the female it is pierced, at the same point and in the same manner, by the round ligament of the uterus. The aperture, which is thus formed, receives the name of the external abdominal ring. At the present stage of the dissection, this opening is not visible, because its lips are carried downwards upon the spermatic cord or round ligament of the uterus in the form of a thin membranaceous fascia, which is called the external spermatic or the intercolitmnar fascia. If the cord be raised and rendered tense, this covering will be observed to invest it completely, and to be some- what funnel-shaped—wide above, but closing upon the cord as it is traced downwards. With the point of the knife divide the external spermatic fascia round the cord, and then, with the handle, define the margins of the external abdominal ring. When this is done, the dissector will obsei-ve that the term " ring," as applied to this opening, is calculated to convey to the mind an erroneous im- pression. It is not circular, but triangular in shape. The direction of the opening is very oblique, the base of the triangle being formed by the crest of the pubes, whilst the apex is directed outwards and slightly upwards. The external abdominal ring, therefore, is merely a small gap or interval left between that portion of the aponeurosis which is inserted into Poupart's ligament and that portion which is inserted into the front of the

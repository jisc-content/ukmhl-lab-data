76 ABDOMEN. The last dorsal nerve has the same relation in the abdominal wall as the preceding nerves. It gives off the same branches. Its latei^al cutaneous branch, however, goes to the skin of the buttock. The ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal are the two lowest nerves of the series. They are directed forwards between the internal oblique and the transversalis close to the crest of the ilium. The ilio-hypogastric is the higher of the two, and gives off an iliac or lateral branch, which pierces the two oblique muscles and then crosses the crest of the ilium to reach the skin of the gluteal region. The hypogas- tric portion of the nerve perforates the internal oblique a short distance in front of the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and then runs forwards towards the linea alba. It becomes superficial by piercing the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique immediately above the external abdominal ring. The ilio-inguinal nerve gives off no lateral branch. It pierces the internal oblique, to which it gives branches, and it becomes superficial by passing through the external abdominal ring. Transversalis Muscle.â€”This is the deepest of the three muscular strata which enter into the formation of the wall of the abdomen.* It has a threefold origin viz., from the pelvis, from the vertebral column, and from the costal cartilages. By its pelvic origin it is attached to the outer third of Poupart's ligament and * The transversalis lies on the same plane as the triangularis sterm muscle of the thoracic wall, and is thus considered by many to be the representative of that muscle in the abdominal wall.

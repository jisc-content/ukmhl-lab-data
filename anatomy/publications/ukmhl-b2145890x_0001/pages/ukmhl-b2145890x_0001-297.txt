ABDOMINAL WALL. 73 the outer and anterior aspects of the cord in the form of loops, the concavities of which are directed upwards. The depth to which these loops descend varies. Some reach the tunica vaginalis of the testicle, and the scrotum should now be opened up on the right side, in order that they may be traced downwards to this point; the majority of the fibres, however, do not reach so far down, some going no further than the external abdominal ring. Upon the posterior aspect of the cord the loops are directed upwards, and some reaching the os pubis, obtain a tendinous insertion into its spine. It will be noticed that the cremasteric fleshy loops do not form a complete investment for the cord and testicle. The intervals between the fasciculi are occupied by areolar tissue, and this combination of muscular and areolar tissue is sometimes termed the cremasteric fascia. Reflection of Internal Oblique.â€”On the right side of the body the entire muscle may be reflected, but on the left side preserve the lower portion of it (which is still covered by the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique) in situ. Begin below by dividing the muscular fibres along the crest of the ilium. The depth to which the knife should be carried is indi- cated by the dense areolar tissue, which lies between it and the subjacent transversalis muscle. An as- cending branch from the deep circumflex iliac artery will also serve as a guide. It emerges from the fibres of the transversalis close to the fore part of the iliac

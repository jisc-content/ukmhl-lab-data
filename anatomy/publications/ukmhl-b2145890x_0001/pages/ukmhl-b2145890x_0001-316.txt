92 ABDOMEN. The deep circumflex iliac springs from the outer side of the external iliac artery, about the same level as the deep epigastric, and runs outwards behind Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. From this point onwards it takes the crest of the ilium as its guide, and ends by anastomosing with the iUo-lumbar artery. At first it is placed in the extra-peritoneal fat, and consequently it lies between the fascia transversaHs and the peritoneum. Its course behind Poupart's ligament is indicated by a whitish line, which marks the union of the fascia transversaHs and fascia iHaca ; and if the former fascia be now divided along this line, the deep circumflex ihac will be exposed. At the crest of the ilium the vessel pierces the fascia transversaHs, and lies between this and the transversaHs muscle; and lastly, about the middle point of the iliac crest it pierces the transvers- aHs muscle, and its terminal twigs ramify between it and the internal oblique. In this manner, then, the artery gradually approaches the surface as we trace it from its origin to its termination, and its relations may be expressed thus :â€” (i.) Between fascia transversaHs and peritoneum. (2.) Between fascia transversaHs and transversaHs muscle. (3.) Between transversaHs muscle and internal obHque muscle. The dissector has already seen the ascending branch which it sends upwards between the internal oblique and transversaHs muscles.

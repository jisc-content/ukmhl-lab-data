BLADDER. 2/7 gut is empty. Owing to the contraction of the sphincter ani, and the narrowing of the anal orifice, the folds at this point are longitudinal, and are termed the columns of Morgagni^ or the coliimncB recti. When the rectum is distended, all these rugae disappear. In addition to the efifaceable rugs, there are three per- manent oblique folds which must be noticed; one is situated at the level of the prostate—at the junc- tion of the second and third parts of the rectum— another about the level of the promontory of the sacrum, and the third is intermediate. With these folds the name of Houston is usually associated. Coats of the Bladder.—The bladder must be fully distended with air before the dissection of its walls is commenced. It presents the same coats as the intestine, viz.:— (i.) Serous. (2.) Subserous. (3.) Muscular. (4.) Submucous. (5.) Mucous. The serous covermg is partial and confined to its posterior aspect. The subserous coat consists of a thin stratum of areolar tissue, which binds the peri- toneum to the muscular coat. The vesical layer of pelvic fascia may be considered to thin away into this coat. The muscular tunic presents three layers of non- striated muscular fibres, viz.: (i.) External longitudinal fibres. (2.) Circular fibres. (3-) Internal longitudinal fibres.

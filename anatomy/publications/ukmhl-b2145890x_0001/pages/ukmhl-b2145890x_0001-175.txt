THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. 163 The superior vena cava should also be examined at this stage. Its mode and place of origin have already been noted. It opens inferiorly into the right auricle of the heart. Note particularly its relation to the pericardium. The fibrous pericardium clothes it for about one inch and a-half above its termination, whilst the serous pericardium gives it a tubular sheath of nearly the same extent. At the point where the fibrous pericardium blends with the coats of the vein it is joined by the vena azygos major which comes 1 forward above the right bronchus for this purpose. â– . Now study the relations of the superior vena cava ; to J the right is the pleura and phrenic nerve; to the left is the ascending part of the arch of the aorta ; posteriorly lit is in relation to the root of the lung. THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. The position, relations, and external configuration cof the heart should now be studied, and before opening lits chambers it is well to dissect the vessels and nerves \which are distributed upon its surface. Coronary Arteries.-These are two in number. iTThey will be found by dissecting deeply upon each kside of the root of the aortic arch, from each side of which one will be seen to take origin. The left coronary ^artery springs from the left anterior sinus of Valsalva and proceeds outwards behind the pulmonary artery. [It now winds round the left side of the heart, and ^snds on its posterior aspect by anastomosing with the right coronary artery. Throughout its entire course it hes in the auriculo-ventricular groove. It gives off

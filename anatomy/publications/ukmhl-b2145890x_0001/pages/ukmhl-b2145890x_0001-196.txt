184 THORAX. and throw each outwards towards the lung with which it is connected. Draw aside the transverse portion of the aortic arch, the trachea will now be seen to ex- tend downwards as far as the foiirth ox fifth cervical vertebra, where it ends by dividing into the two bronchi. Remove the bronchial glands which occupy the angle between the bronchi. The relations of the thoracic part of the trachea may now be studied. In front of it the dissector will recogniseâ€”(I.) the manubrium sterni, to the posterior aspect of which the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are attached ; (2.) the remains of the thymus body; (3.) the left innominate vein; (4.) the transverse portion of the aortic arch and the origins of the inno- minate and left common carotid arteries ; (5.) the deep cardiac plexus. Behind, it rests upon the cesophagus, which lies somewhat to the left side. On its right side are the pleura and the right pneumogastric nerve; and on its left side are the pleura, the left pneumogastric nerve, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the left common carotid artery. The two bronchi differ greatly from each other. The right bronchus is shorter and wider, and almost hori- zontal in its course. The vena azygos major passes forwards, in contact with its upper surface, to reach the superior vena cava. The left bronchus is longer, narrower, and more oblique in its course. It enters the left lung fully an inch lower down in the chest than the right bronchus enters the right lung. As it passes outwards and downwards it crosses in front of the oesophagus and the descending aorta. From its

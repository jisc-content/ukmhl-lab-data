1^8 ABDOMEN. closely to the subjacent fibrous coat that it can only be removed with difficulty. With regard to '&i^fibro- elastic tunic, it should be noted that processes proceed from its deep surface and dip into the substance of the organ. These are the trabeculce, and they constitute the supporting framework of the gland-pulp. On account of this arrangement it will be found utterly impossible to strip off the fibrous coat of the spleen without at the same time lacerating its surface. Make a section through the organ, and carry a portion of it to the tap. By squeezing it and allowing the water to run freely over it, a partial view of the trabecular framework may be obtained. Stomach and Duodenum.-Detach the pancreas from the duodenum, but leave a portion of the duct m connection with the gut. Next clean out the stomach and duodenum by allowing water to run freely through them, and then render their walls tense by mflatmg them with air. The coats of the stomach should now be exammed. They are five in number, viz.:â€” (i.) Peritoneal, or serous. (2.) Subserous. (3.) Muscular. (4.) Submucous. (5.) Mucous. The serous coat, derived from the peritoneal mem- brane, can be best stripped off with the fingers. The subserous coatis composed of a little areolar tissue which intervenes between the muscular and serous strata.

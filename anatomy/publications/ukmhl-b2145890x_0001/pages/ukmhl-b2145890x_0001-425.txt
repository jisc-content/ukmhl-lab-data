199 THE DIAPHRAGM. gap or interval exists between the fibres which spring from the ligamentum arcuatum externum and those which arise directly from the last rib. The anterior, lateral and posterior attachments of the diaphragm are therefore in this manner marked off from each other. The crura of the diaphragm are two thick fleshy processes which descend upon the bodies of the upper lumbar vertebrae, tapering as they proceed downwards, and finally ending in pointed tendinous extremities. The right cms is the larger and longer of the two. It takes origin from the bodies of the upper three lumbar vertebrae, and the intervertebral discs which intervene between them. The left crus springs from the left side of the bodies of the first two lumbar vertebrae. It is much smaller, and lies upon a posterior plane to the right crus. Follow the crura upwards; opposite the last dorsal vertebra, they will be observed to be connected across the middle line by a strong fibrous band which arches over the aorta. From the upper border of this fibrous arch fleshy fibres arise which join both crura, and on this account some anatomists are inclined to classify it with the arcuate ligaments, and give it the name of ligamentum arcuatum medium* Above this level the fleshy fibres of the crura . * It may be regarded as a universal law that wherever an artery pierces the origin or insertion of a muscle, and comes to lie between bone and muscular fibres, it is protected by a fibrous arch. Of this nature is the arch in question, and the fibrous arch thrown over the superior profunda artery on the back of the humerus, and the fibrous arches in the adductor magnus for the passage of the perforating arteries, and the femoral artery itself.

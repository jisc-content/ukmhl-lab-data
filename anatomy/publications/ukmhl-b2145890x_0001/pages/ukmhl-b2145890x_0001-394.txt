168 ABDOMEN. Vena Portae.—This is a most remarkable vessel. It arises after the manner of a vein, by gathering, by means of its rootlets, the blood from the capillaries of the entire abdominal portion of the alimentary canal (with the exception of the lower end of the rectum), the spleen, pancreas, and gall-bladder, whilst it ends in the liver after the manner of an artery, by pouring its blood into the hepatic capillaries. The blood which flows in the portal vein, therefore, passes through two series of capillaries before it is returned to the heart, viz.—(i.) the capillaries of the organ from which it is derived ; (2.) the hepatic capillaries. The portal vein is formed behind the pancreas, between it and the vena cava, by the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. From this- it ascends, with an inclination to the right, and ends near the right extremity of the transverse fissure of the liver by dividing into a right and left branch, one for each lobe of this organ. After emerging from under cover of the pancreas, it lies first behind the ascending portion of the duodenum, and then between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum, close to its right free margin. In the latter situation it is placed behind and between the hepatic artery and the bile duct, and is closely surrounded by the hepatic nerves and lymphatics. The vena portae receives the coronary vein and the cystic vein. The latter, however, may join its right branch. The branches of the portal venous system are devoid of valves, and we shall afterwards see that this is a great predisposing cause in the production of hemorrhoids.

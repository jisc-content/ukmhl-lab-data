FRONT OF THE THIGH. 8i demarcation between the cribriform fascia and the .iliacportion of the fascia lata (this is the name given ito that part of the fascia lata which lies external to ithe opening) may be readily made out. Take care mot to injure the subjacent femoral sheath, and note 1 how the superior cornu arches over the femoral vein Ito fuse with Gimbernat's ligament. The oval shape of the opening is now apparent. Its inner boundary is seen to be exceedingly ill-defined, and to be formed by the receding pubic portion of the fascia lata; the crescentic outer boundary is seen to be formed by the iliac portion of the fascia lata. Lastly, bear in mind that the saphenous opening in the undissected state is closed in by the cribriform portion ' of the fascia lata. Reflection of Skin.—The next step in the dissec- tion consists in reflecting the skin from the lower two- thirds of the front of the thigh, and also from the anterior aspect of the knee. This is effected by extending the vertical incision, which has already been made upon the inner aspect of the thigh, downwards to the internal tuberosity of the tibia, and then carry- ing a transverse incision from the lower end of the vertical cut outwards over the front of the leg to its outer aspect. (PI. II.) In raising the skin from the front of the knee take care not to injure the patellar plexus of nerves or the patellar bursa. Cutaneous Nerves.—The cutaneous nerves are now to be looked for in the superficial fascia. They are six in number, and are derived from two G

THORACIC WALL. which occupy the eleven intercostal spaces. In each space there are two strata of muscular fibresâ€”a super- ficial and a deep. The superficial layer of muscular fibres is called the external intercostal muscle, and the deep layer the internal intercostal muscle. The external intercostal muscles are already exposed, and very little cleaning is necessary to bring out their connections. Observe that entering into their consti- tution there is a large admixture of tendinous fibres, and that these, as well as the muscular fibres, are directed from above, obliquely downwards and forwards. They do not extend further forwards in the various spaces than a point corresponding to the union of the bony with the cartilaginous parts of the costal arches. Here the muscular fibres stop short, but the tendinous fibres are prolonged onwards to the sternum in the form of a membrane which may be called the anterior intercostal membrane. The external intercostal mus- cles of the two lower spaces are exceptions to this rule. They extend forwards to the extremities of the spaces. Posteriorly the muscles pass backwards as far as the tubercles of the ribs, but this is a point which can only be satisfactorily demonstrated after the thorax has been opened into. To bring the internal intercostal muscles into view it is necessary to reflect the external intercostal muscles, and also the anterior intercostal membranes. Divide them along the upper borders of the ribs which bound the spaces inferiorly, and throw them upwards. This dissection should be performed in each inter- costal space, and, in effecting it, care must be taken

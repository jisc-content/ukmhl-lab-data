45 DEEP DISSECTION OF PALM. Now divide the annular ligament at its middle, and cutting through the fleshy belly of the flexor sublimis digitorum, raise the tendons from the hollow of the carpus and throw them forwards as far as the roots of the fingers. After examining the four lum- brical muscles, the same course must be followed with the flexor profundus digitorum. The deep palmar arch and its branches and the deep branch of the ulnar nerve must now be carefully dissected out, and at the same time the short muscles of the thumb and little finger cleaned and separated from each other. Short Muscles of the Thumb.—The abductor poinds forms the most prominent and external part of the ball of the thumb. The outer or superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis lies immediately to the inner side of this muscle, and separating the one from the other, the opponents pollicis will be exposed. These three muscles lie to the outer side of the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. To the inner side of this - tendon, and lying deeply in the palm, are the in7ier or deep head of the flexor brevis and the adductor pollicis^ The line of origin of these two muscles is quite con- tinuous, so that at first sight they seem to constitute a single muscle. Short Muscles of the Little Finger. —The abductor minimi digiti lies to the inside, and the flexoi" brevis to the outside. On separating these from each other, the opponens is seen in the interval between them. Deep Palmar Arch is mainly formed by the radial which appears in the palm by coming forward between

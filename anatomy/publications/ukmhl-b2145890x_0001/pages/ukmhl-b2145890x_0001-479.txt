PELVIC VISCERA. in the posterior false vesical ligament at a lower level than the obliterated hypogastric artery. It enters the bladder about two inches behind the prostate, and about the same distance from its fellow of the opposite side. The Prostate.—This is a solid body, partly glandu- lar and partly muscular, which embraces the neck of the bladder and surrounds the first part of the urethra. In shape, it is conical, and somewhat resembles a Spanish chesnut—its base being directed upwards and backwards, and its apex downwards and forwards. In size, it is variable ; but, its average dimensions are commonly stated to be about one and a-quarter inches from base to apex, and one and a-half inches from side to side at its broadest part. The prostate rests upon the anterior aspect of the rectum at the junction of the second and third parts. It is therefore one and a-half inches distant from the anus, whilst its upper surface lies fully three-quarters of an inch below the symphysis pubis. Capsule of the Prostate.—The prostate has already been noticed to be enclosed within a dense capsule derived from the pelvic fascia, and when the con- stitution of this capsule is analysed, it will be seen that the vesical, recto-vesical, and parietal layers of this fascia all enter into its composition. The vesical layer, in which the pubo-prostatic or anterior true ligaments of the bladder are developed, forms the anterior part; the recto-vesical layer closes it behind ; whilst the saine layer and the parietal pelvic fascia complete it below. These points are brought out in a diagrammatic manner in Figs. 42, p. 241; 44, p. 244;

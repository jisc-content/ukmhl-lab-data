The/ri-/ dorsal nerve will be found passing upwards over the neck of the first rib to join the brachial plexus. It gives a small twig to the first intercostal space, but this nerve, although it is disposed after the manner of an intercostal nerve, furnishes no lateral cutaneous branch. The second dorsal or intercostal nerve almost invariably sends a branch upwards over the neck of the second rib to join that portion of the first dorsal nerve which enters the brachial plexus (Fig. i). As a general rule, this communicating twig is exceedingly minute and insignificant, but sometimes it is a large nerve; and, in these cases, the intercosto- humeral nerve, or lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve, is very small or altogether absent. Veins of the Thoracic Wall.—When the dissector has traced the intercostal veins to their various destina- tions, he will find that they differ in their arrangement upon the two sides of the body. On the right side they terminate in three different ways :— (i.) The intercostal vein of the first or highest space joins the right innominate vein (sometimes the vertebral vein). (2.) The intercostal veins of the second and third spaces (and sometimes of the fourth space) unite into a. common trunk, which joins the upper part of the vena azygos major. (3.) The intercostal veins of the eight lower spaces join the vena azygos major. ■

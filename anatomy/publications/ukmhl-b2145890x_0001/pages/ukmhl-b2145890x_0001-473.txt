247 PELVIC FASCIA. pelvic viscera may be obtained. The first step to take is to divide the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia from behind forwards, about half-an-inch from the white line. Next, saw through the pubic bone, half- an-inch external to the symphysis, and divide the great sacro-sciatic ligament close to the sacrum. The further separation of the bone should be effected at the sacro-iliac articulation by means of the saw. In connection with the detached innominate bone, a good view may be obtained of the fascial origin of the levator ani (Fig. 41, p. 240), and also of the origin of the obturator internus. It is better, however, to defer the description of these muscles until the viscera are removed. The dissector should in the next place turn his attention to that portion of the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia which has been left attached to the viscera. Follow it as far as possible in its reflections upon them, but preserve intact the capsule of the prostate. When thoroughly satisfied upon this point, remove what remains of the fascia on the right side, and clean the viscera, taking care not to injurethe blood- vessels and nerves which supply them. This dissection will be much facilitated if the rectum be moderately stufibd with tow, and the bladder partially inflated with air. In the case of the rectum, first cleanse it thoroughly by allowing water from the tap to run freely through it, and in the case of the bladder, first pass a staff into it through the urethra, and having placed a ligature around the penis, introduce the air through a blow-pipe thrust into one of the ureters.

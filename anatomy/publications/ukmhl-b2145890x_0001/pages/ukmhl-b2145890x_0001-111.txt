99 FRONT OF THE THIGH. now be followed backwards. It arises at the upper border of the pectineus and passes back between this muscle and the psoas, then between the adductor brevis and obturator externus, and it appears in the gluteal region in the interval between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris. In every region of the thigh the dissector has met with branches of the femoral artery. It is well now that he should revert to this vessel and study its branches systematically. The following Table may aid him in doing this :—. Superficial inguinal. Femoral. / /Superficial pudic. Superficial epigastric. Superficial circumflex iliac. Inferior external pudic. External circumflex. Internal circumflex. First perforating. Second perforating. {Nutrient. Third perforating. Fourth perforating, or terminal. Profunda or deep femoral. Muscular. \Anastomotica magna. Adductor Brevis and Obturator Nerve.—The adductor brevis muscle should be examined in its relation to this nerve. The anterior portion of the nerve lies upon its superficial surface and dispenses branches to four muscles, viz.—(i.) adductor longus ; (2.) adductor brevis; (3.) gracilis ; (4.) and sometimes the pectineus. In addition to these it gives a filament to the plexus of nerves which lies along the inner

138 LOWER LIMB. aspects of the foot. They are arranged so as to abduct the four outer toes from a line drawn through the second toe. They are inserted, therefore, as follows :— the first upon the tibial side of the second toe; the second upon the fibular side of the same toe ; the third upon the fibular side of the third toe; and the fourth upon the fibular side of the fourth toe. Man stands alone in regard to this arrangement of the interossei muscles. In other mammals the interossei of the pes are arranged in a manner similar to those of the manus—viz., with reference to a line drawn through the middle digit. Before leaving the sole the dissector must determine the precise insertions of the tendons of the tibialis posticus and the peroneus loiigus. The tendon of the tibialis posticus is not merely inserted into the tubercle of the scaphoid. Fibrous slips are seen to spread out from it, and these may be traced to every bone of the tarsus with the exception of the astragalus, and also to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. The tendon of the peroneus longus as it traverses the sole will be seen to be enclosed in a fibrous sheath. Note that this sheath is mainly formed by fibres derived from the long plantar ligament. Open the sheath and its smooth, glistening, internal surface will be displayed. This appearance is due to the synovial membrane which lines it. Anastomoses around the Knee-joint.— The dissector should now study in a connected manner the anastomoses of blood-vessels around the knee and

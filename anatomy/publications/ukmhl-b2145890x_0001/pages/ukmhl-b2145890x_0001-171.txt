THORACIC CAVITY. Phrenic Nerve.—The phrenic nerve has already been observed lying against the side of the pericardium, a short distance in front of the root of the lung. In this position it is retained by the mediastinal pleura. It should now be followed upwards towards the neck, and downwards to the diaphragm. As it enters the thorax it passes behind the subclavian vein and crosses the internal mammary artery from without inwards. Reaching the diaphragm, it breaks up into branches which pierce this structure, and are distributed to it upon its under surface. The nerves of the two sides differ somewhat from each other in certain particulars—(i.) The left phrenic is considerably longer than the same nerve on the right side of the body ; (2.) the left phrenic crosses the arch of the aorta ; (3.) the right phrenic lies in relation to the right side of the right innominate vein and the superior vena cava. Pericardium — Superficial Cardiac Plexus.— The superficial cardiac plexus of nerves should next engage the attention of the dissector. The best plan to adopt in making a dissection of these delicate nervous filaments is to begin by securing the two cardiac nerves which enter the plexus from above, and i trace them downwards. These nerves are—(i.) the cardiac branch from the superior cervical ganglion of the left side; (2.) the inferior cardiac braftch of the left pneumogastric nerve. Look for these nerves upon the arch of the aorta. They will be found crossing it to the left of the phrenic

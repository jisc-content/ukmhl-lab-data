The tributaries of this vein are the intercostal veins of the three lower spaces of the left side. The veins of the thoracic parietes are extremely variable, and the above description of them must be looked upon as merely representing their most usual arrangement.* The student should now complete the dissection of the thorax by an examination of the vertebral and costo-vertebral ligaments. * This description of the intercostal veins will be found to differ materially from that given by other text-books of anatomy. B. G. Morison, by a large number of dissections, has proved the above arrangement to be the one most commonly met with (vide Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, 1879). AND GILLIES, PRINTERS 31 ST.

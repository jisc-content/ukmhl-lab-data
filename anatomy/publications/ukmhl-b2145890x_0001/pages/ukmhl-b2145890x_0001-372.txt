146 ABDOMEN. The inferior pancreatico-duodenal takes origin from the superior mesenteric under cover of the pancreas. It has a curved course round the head of this gland, be- tween it and the duodenum, and gives branches to both. It ends by anastomosing with the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery. The rami intestini tenuis spring from the convexity of the superior mesenteric, and proceed obHquely downwards and to the left, between the layers of the mesentery, to supply the jejunum and ileum. They are very numerous (from fifteen to twenty in number), and, by their mutual inosculations, they form a very remarkable series of arches before they finally reach the bowel. At first they run parallel to one another, but soon they divide into two branches, each of which joins its neighbour, and in this way a succession of arterial arcades is formed. From these smaller twigs proceed, which divide and unite in a similar manner to form a second series of arches, and so on, until three, four, or perhaps even five tiers of arterial arcades are produced. From the lowest arches a multitude of minute twigs pass directly to the wall of the intestine. The colic branches spring from the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery. The ileo-colic artery, the lowest of the three branches which go to the great intestine, proceeds downwards, between the two layers of the mesentery, towards the right iliac fossa, and divides into a descending and an ascending branch. The descending branch joins the

83 FRONT OF THE THIGH. internal saphenous vein. Follow it as it runs over the patella. The iyiner division reaches the surface on the inner side of the knee behind the long saphenous nerve. The long saphenous nerve "becomes cutaneous on the inner side of the knee by perforating the fascia between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis muscles. The ' guide to it is the superficial branch of the anastomotic artery which descends alongside of it. Before it pierces the fascia it gives off a patellar branch, which must also be secured. All these cutaneous nerves must be carefully followed in their wide ramifications in the superficial fascia. Four nerves will be found to send twigs to the skin over the knee-joint—viz., the external cutaneous, the middle cutaneous, the anterior branch of the internal cutaneous, and the long saphenous. These nerves ' communicate with each other, and form the patellar plexus. Fascia Lata.—This is the name which is given to that portion of the general aponeurotic investment of the lower limb which clothes the thigh. It should now be carefully cleaned by removing the remains of the superficial fascia. This being done, the dissector will be struck with the marked difference in strength which it shows at the outer and inner aspects of the thigh. Externally it is so dense and strong that it appears to be more tendinous than aponeurotic in its character. The reason of this is, that the tensor fasciae femoris muscle and the greater portion of the gluteus maximus are inserted into it upon this side of the limb. The strong

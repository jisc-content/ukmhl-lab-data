AZYGOS VEINS. 213 thorax by passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm (p. 201). Azygos Veins.—The right azygos vein or vena azygos major usually takes origin by a small branch from one of the right lumbar veins, but in some cases it arises by a twig from the right renal vein or even from the vena cava. It will be found in the interval between the right crus of the diaphragm and the aorta, upon the right side of the receptaculum chyli, and it will be noticed to enter the thorax by passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm. The vena azygos minor inferior is more difficult to discover. It originates on the left side of the spine, in a small twig from one of the left lumbar veins, or perhaps from the left renal vein, and enters the thorax by piercing the left crus of the diaphragm. Fascia and Muscles on the Posterior Wall of the Abdomen. The muscles on the posterior wall of the abdomen are three in number—viz. (i.) The psoas, an elongated fleshy mass extending downwards on the side of the spme; (2.) The quadratus lumbonim, a quadrate muscle external to the psoas, and stretching between the crest of the ilium and the last rib ; (3.) The iliacus, situated in the iliac fossa. The fascia which covers these muscles must, in the first place, be studied. Quadratus Lumborum Fascia.—Follow this inwards and it will be found to be attached to the anterior aspect of the roots of the transverse processes

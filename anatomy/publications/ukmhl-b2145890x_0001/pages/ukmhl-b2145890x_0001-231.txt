MALE PERINEUM. 7 thus formed, which is bounded in front by the super- ficial fascia, behind by the triangular ligament, laterally by the attachment of these to the sides of the pubic arch, whilst below it is closed by the union of the fascia with the base of the triangular ligament (Fig. 3, p. 12). Within this pouch certain very important parts are placed—viz., the superficial perineal muscles, vessels, and nerves, the bulb and crura of the penis, and the termination of the pudic artery. It is partially divided into two lateral parts by a median septum, which dips backwards from the superficial fascia. This septum is very perfect posteriorly, but becomes incomplete towards the scrotum. The student can verify these facts in two ways—viz., (i.) by inflating the pouch with air, and (2.) by dissec- tion. Make a longitudinal incision, large enough to admit the nozzle of the bellows, into the superficial fascia towards the back part of the pouch and a little to one side of the middle line. This cut must be carried through the fascia until the fibres of the super- ficial perineal muscles are exposed. In using the bellows, the margins of the opening into the pouch must be held tightly around its nozzle. You will notice that the air which is introduced passes forwards, and that it is first confined%o one side of the pouch. Reaching the scrotum, however, where the septum is incomplete, it forces its way across the middle line, and inflates the opposite side of the pouch. The pouch is now rendered prominent, and the attachments of the fascia become very evident. The air cannot pass into the rectal triangle owing to the union of the

I6l THORACIC CAVITY. upon the left side of the tendon. Except at one point, no difficulty will be experienced in separating the fibrous pericardium from the diaphragm. The two are simply bound together by a little intervening areolar tissue. Towards the middle line the fibrous pericardium, however, will be found, over a small area, to be inseparably blended with the central tendon of the diaphragm. The pericardium may now be opened by means of a crucial incision, viz.â€”(i.) a longitudinal incision along the middle line of the body from the point where it blends with the sheath of the aorta downwards to the diaphragm; (2.) a transverse cut extending from the middle of the root of one lung to a similar point on the opposite side. The serous internal layer of the pericardium is now brought under the notice of the student. This layer lines the entire inner surface of the fibrous pericardium and is reflected from this on to the surface of the heart. There is a decided difference, then, in the manner in which the fibrous and serous layers of the pericardium are related to the heart and its great vessels. The great vessels pierce the fibrous pericardium. The serous pericardium reaches the heart by being continued over the surface of these vessels. Each vessel, before it pierces the fibrous layer, is thus enclosed within a short tubular sheath of serous pericardium. In the case of the aorta and pulmonary artery, however, you should mote that both are surrounded by the same sheath. Lastly, separate the left pulmonary artery from the tupper of thetwo left pulmonaiy veins and look into M

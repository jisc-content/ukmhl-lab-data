l8o ABDOMEN. mucous membrane will now be seen to be thick, soft, and pulpy. In the dissecting-rooms the student can- not obtain a proper idea of its natural colour. In infancy it is rosy red, but as life advances it gradually becomes paler, and in old age it always presents a brownish hue from the presence of pigment. When the stomach is empty the mucous membrane is thrown into longitudinal folds or rugae, but these dis- appear when the organ is distended. During life the mucous membrane of the stomach is thickest at the cardiac end, but after death it is always thinned at this point by post-mortem digestion. At the pylorus the mucous membrane is raised into a remarkable circular fold, called the pyloric valve (Fig. 31, p. 169). This fold contains between its two layers the sphincter pylori muscle. Duodenum.—In connection with the duodenum, note that the valvulae conniventes begin about one or two inches beyond the pylorus, about the commence- ment of its second part; that the mucous membrane is covered by villi; and that usually no Peyer's patches are to be seen. Pass a probe along the bile duct, and another along the pancreatic duct. These ducts will then be observed to pierce the coats of the duodenum, side by side, very obliquely, and to open by a common orifice, which is placed on the summit of a papillar>' projection of mucous membrane. Removal of the Liver.—The student has already examined the position and connections of the liver (p. 118). It should now be removed from the abdo-

UPPER LIMB. latter lies upon the supinator brevis muscle. It lies close to the outer side of the radial artery in the middle third of the forearm, and then leaves it by winding round the outer margin of the limb under cover of the tendon of the supinator longus. It gives off no branches until it becomes superficial. The posterior interosseous nerve, the other terminal branch of the musculo-spiral, will be observed to disappear from view by passing backwards through the fibres of the supinator brevis. The median nerve, as its name implies, passes down the middle of the forearm, and, to obtain an unbroken view of it, the dissector must reflect the condylar origin of the pronator teres and the radial origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum. Accom- panying the nerve is an artery, the median branch of the anterior interosseous arteryâ€”usually small, but sometimes it attains a considerable size. The branches which the median gives to the flexor muscles and the pronator teres come ofl" from it shortly after it has entered the forearm. A long slender branch called the anterior interosseous nerve will be seen to sink into the interval between the flexor longus pollicis muscle and the flexor profundus digitorum. It accompanies the anterior interosseous artery, and supplying the muscles between which it lies, it ends in the pronator quadratus. It should be noted that the median gives no branch to the flexor carpi ulnaris, and that those twigs which enter the flexor profundus only supply its outer part, or that part from which the tendons for the index and middle fingers arise.

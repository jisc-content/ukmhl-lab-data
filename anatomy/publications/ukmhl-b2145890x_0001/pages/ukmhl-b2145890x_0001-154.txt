THORAX. 142 C Anterior intercostal membrane. Membranes. -] Posterior intercostal membrane. V Pleural membrane (parietal part). Portions of certain of the muscles of the upper limb and of the abdominal wall will be noticed attached to the thoracic wall. From before, backwards, the dissector will meet with the pectoralis major, the pector- alis minor, and the serratus magnus, whilst towards the lower margin of the chest he will recognise the rectus abdominis in front, and the ohliquus externus and latissimus dorsi upon its lateral aspect. The rounded tendon of the subclavius may also be observed taking origin from the first costal arch, and posteriorly to this the scalenus posticus extends downwards to its insertion into the second rib. With the single excep- tion of the scalenus posticus, these muscles should be removed so as to lay bare the costal arches and the intercostal muscles. In detaching the serratus mag- nus be careful not to injure the lateral ciiianeous nerves which make their appearance in the intervals between its digitations. The anterior cutaneous nerves and the perforating branches of the internal mammary artery must also be preserved ; they pierce the origin of the pectoralis major in the intervals between the costal cartilages, and close to the margin of the sternum. Intercostal Muscles.â€”These are the muscles Nerves and Arteries.

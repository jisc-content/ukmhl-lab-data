182 THORAX. immediately below the point where it is joined by the vena azygos major. By cutting the fibrous ductus arteriosus the transverse part of the arch can be drawn aside. The deep cardiac plexus of nerves lies between the transverse portion of the aortic arch and the lower end of the trachea, at a higher level than the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. It consists of a right and a left portion connected by numerous communicating fila- ments. The right part of the deep cardiac plexus receives the following cardiac nerves :—(^.) the three cervical cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the right side; (^.) all the cardiac nerves of the right vagus; (^.) a few minute twigs from the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. The branches of this portion of the plexus are distri- buted as follows:-(«.) the greater number join with twigs from the superficial cardiac plexus to form the anterior coronary plexus, which is associated with the left coronary artery; (^.) a few supply the right auricle; (^.) some offsets are sent to the right anterior pulmon- ary plexus ; (^.) a few twigs go to the posterior coron- ary plexus. Entering into the formation of the left portion of the plexus, there are—the two lowest cervical cardiac branches of the sympathetic of the left side ; (^.) all the cardiac nerves of the left vagus with the exception of its lowest cervical cardiac branch ; (r.) some offsets of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Its branches have the following distribution :-(^.) the greater num- ber form the posterior coronary plexus, which is asso-

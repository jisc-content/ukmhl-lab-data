EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 211 The External Iliac Artery is the first or abdo- minal portion of the great arterial trunk which carries blood to the lower limb. It begins, as we have seen, opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation, and extends obliquely downwards and outwards along the brim of the true pelvis to Poupart's ligament, behind which it passes into the thigh, and becomes femoral artery. Its course can be indicated on the surface with tolerable accuracy by drawing a line from the left side of the umbilicus to a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Like the common iliac artery, the external iliac is closely covered by peritoneum and overlapped by coils of the small intestine. Towards its termination it is crossed by an artery, a vein, and a minute nerve—viz., the spermatic artery, the deep circumflex iliac vein, and the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve. Posteriorly, it rests upon the inner margin of the psoas muscle, separated from it, however, by the iliac fascia, to which it is bound down by a condensed part of the extra-peritoneal tissue, which passes over it. The genito-crural nerve lies along the outer side of the artery, and the companion vein is placed on its inner side; on the right side, however, the vein, as it passes upwards, gradually comes to lie behind the artery. The external iliac gives off two large branches to the abdominal wall, viz.:— (i.) The deep epigastric. (2.) The deep circumflex iliac. They arise close to Poupart's ligament, and have both

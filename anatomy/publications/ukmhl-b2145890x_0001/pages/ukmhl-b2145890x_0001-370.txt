144 ABDOMEN. The Mesentery Proper.—Throw the great omen- tum and transverse colon upwards over the ribs and examine the mesentery proper. It will be found to be attached to the posterior wall of the abdomen along an oblique line which extends from the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, down- wards and to the right, into the right iliac fossa. This attachment is termed the root of the mesentery, and is comparatively narrow, but as the mesentery approaches the coils of the jejunum and ileum it widens out enormously, so that when it reaches the . gut its width equals the length of these two portions of the small intestine. This great width is not ap- parent, because the mesentery is wrinkled, or thrown into folds like a goffered frill. The coiled condition of the gut is due to this arrangement. The two layers of the mesentery are not in direct apposition with each other. They are separated by certain structures which lie between them, viz.— (i.) The superior mesenteric vessels. (2.) The superior mesenteric nerves. (3.) Great numbers of lymphatic glands and lacteal vessels. These must now be dissected. Remove the anterior layer from the root of the mesentery down to where | it is attached to the gut. Begin at the upper end of the jejunum at the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and gradually travel downwards to the lower end of the ileum, stripping off the peritoneum and cleaning the structures exposed.

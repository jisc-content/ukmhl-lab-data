ABDOMINAL WALL. 57 urethral triangle of the perineum the superficial fascia is attached laterally to the margins of the pubic arch, and posteriorly to the base of the triangular ligament, whilst anteriorly towards the abdomen it is free, he will have little difficulty in understanding the course which urine takes when extravasated from a*i-upture of the urethra in front of the triangular ligament. The effused fluid is directed upwards over the scrotum and penis, and along the spermatic cords to the front of the abdomen. From the abdomen it cannot pass downwards to the front of the thighs, owing to the attachment of the superficial fascia to the fascia lata. Unless vent be given to it by early and free incisions, it will continue to ascend over the abdomen. Cutaneous Nerves.â€”A dissection must now be made of the cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. These are arranged on the same plan as the cutaneous nerves of the chest. We have therefore to look for an anterior and a late^^al series. Anterior cutaneous nerves. (2.) Hypogastric branch of the ilio- hypogastric nerve. (3.) The ilio-inguinal nerve; / (i.) Lateral cutaneous nerves. \ (2.) Lateral or iliac branch of last Lateral series. < dorsal nerve. / (3.) Iliac branch of ilio-hypogastric ^ nerve. The anterior cutaneous nerves are the small terminal twigs of the lower four or five intercostal nerves.

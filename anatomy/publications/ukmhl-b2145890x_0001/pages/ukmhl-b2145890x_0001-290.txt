66 ABDOMEN. cord, and consequently, as we have already seen, the term " intercolumnar" is frequently applied to the latter. Reflection of the Obliquus Externus.'â€”The external oblique muscle should now be reflected. Begin by detaching each digitation from the rib to which it is fixed. Between the last rib and the crest of the ilium the posterior border of the muscle will be found free; sometimes it is slightly overlapped by the latissimus dorsi, but in other cases a small portion of the internal oblique muscle can be observed in a trian- gular interval between them. These points can only be seen by tilting the body slightly over on its op- posite side. Raise the posterior border of the muscle from the subjacent internal oblique, and divide the fleshy fibres which are inserted into the crest of the ilium close to the bone. Next divide the aponeurosis horizontally in a line leading from the anterior supe- rior spine of the ilium to the outer border of the rectus. The entire muscular portion, and the greater part of the aponeurotic portion of the external oblique can now be thrown forward. On approaching the outer border of the rectus, the dissector must proceed with care, because a little beyond this the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique fuses with the deep surface of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. Define the line of union, and notice that it does not extend beyond the lower margin of the thorax. Above this the rectus is simply covered by the aponeurosis of the external oblique; the outer

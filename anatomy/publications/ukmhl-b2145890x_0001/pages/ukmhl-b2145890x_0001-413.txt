187 THE LIVER. stance which connects the Spigelian lobe with the general mass of the right lobe. It extends obliquely forwards and to the right, between the extremity of the transverse fissure and the commencement of the fissure for the vena cava. To the right of these subsidiary lobes the under surface of the right lobe presents two slight hollows, of which the anterior corresponds to the hepatic flexure of the colon and the posterior to the right suprarenal capsule and kidney. Gail-Bladder and Bile Ducts.â€”The gall-bladder is a pyriform membranous bag placed in a depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver. Its form and position can be seen to best advantage by inflating it with air through the bile duct. It lies somewhat obliquely, its great end or fundus free and covered by peritoneum, being directed downwards, forwards, and to the right, so as to project slightly beyond the anterior border of the liver, whilst its narrow extremity or neck ends near the right end of the transverse fissure, by making a double bend like the letter S) and then becoming continuous with the cystic duct. The upper surface is in contact with the liver, to which it is connected by areolar tissue. The under surface is clothed by peritoneum, and is in relation in front to the transverse colon, and behind to the first part of the duodenum. The cystic duct has already been observed to pro- ceed downwards and to the left to join the hepatic duct, and thereby form the common bile duct. The

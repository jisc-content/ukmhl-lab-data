200 ABDOMEN. diverse and ascend to join the posterior border of the central tendon. The innermost fibres of each crus, however, decussate so as to separate the aortic from the oesophageal openings. The decussating fasciculus of the right crus is always the larger of the two, and moreover it usually passes in front of the decussating fasciculus of the left crus. Central Tendon.—The central tendon is exceed- ingly strong. It is composed of strong tendinous bundles running in different directions, and closely woven together so as to give it a plaited appearance. This is well seen by an inspection of its abdominal surface. In shape the central tendon resembles a trefoil leaf, of which the right lobe is the largest, and the left lobe the smallest. Upon all sides it is surrounded by muscular fibres. Those which spring from the sternum are much the shortest. Foramina of the Diaphragm.—The continuity of the diaphragm is broken by three large openings, and by some smaller apertures or fissures for the passage of the splanchnic nerves, and the vena azygos minor. The three main openings receive the names of the most important objects which they transmit. They are:— (i.) The aortic. (2.) The vena caval. (3.) The oesophageal. The aortic opening is in the mesial plane in front of the last dorsal vertebra, and between the crura of the diaphragm. It is bounded in front by the

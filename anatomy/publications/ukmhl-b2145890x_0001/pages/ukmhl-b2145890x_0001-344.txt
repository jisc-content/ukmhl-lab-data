120 ABDOMEN. left hypochondrium, it can readily be discovered and pulled forwards for inspection. It is a solid organ, oval in form, but somewhat com- pressed laterally. It lies obliquely in the abdominal cavity; indeed, it is oblique in two directions—viz., from above downwards and outwards, and from above downwards and forwards. The superior extremity of the spleen is attached to the diaphragm by a peritoneal fold, called thQphreniQO- splenic ligament. The inferior extremity, which is somewhat pointed, is in relation to the splenic flexure of the colon, and rests upon the phrenico-colic ligament, a fold of peritoneum which binds the splenic flexure of the colon to the diaphragm. The external surface is smooth and rounded, and lies upon the diaphragm, which intervenes between it and the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs—to the curvature of which it is adapted. The internal surf ace is concave, and is connected with the posterior aspect of the fundus of the stomach by a peritoneal fold, called the gastro-splenic omentum. This surface shows a longitudinal slit, called the hilus, which gives passage to the vessels and nerves which pass to and from the organ. The stomach overlaps the inner surface of the spleen, and the left crus of the diaphragm and the kidney are in relation to it behind the hilus. The anterior border is usually notched. The posterior border is thicker than the anterior border. Stomach.—The stomach is the most dilated part of the alimentary canal, and constitutes the receptacle

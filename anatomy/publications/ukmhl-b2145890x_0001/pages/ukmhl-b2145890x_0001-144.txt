LOWER LIMB. base of the fifth metatarsal bone, the artery disappears from view by turning inwards under cover of the flexor tendons. At the same point the external plantar nerve divides into its superficial and deep dwisioits, The deep division of the external plantar nerve cannot be dissected at present as it accompanies the external plantar artery. The superficial division, however, should now be traced to its distribution. It ends by dividing into two digital branchesâ€”(^.) to the fibular side of the little toe ; (^.) to the contiguous sides of the fourth toe and little toe. The first or outermost of these digital nerves, if sufficient care be taken in its dissection, will be found to supply twigs to the. flexor brevis minimi digiti and to the muscles m the fourth interosseous space. TV^ flexor brevis digitormn should now be detached from the os calcis and thrown forwards. The origin of the abductor hallucis from the same bone and from the . internal annular ligament should also be divided and the muscle turned inwards. With a little dissection the mode and place of origin of the plantar arteries and nerves will be made manifest. They are the terminal branches of the posterior tibial artery and nerve, and they arise in the hollow of the os calcis under cover of the origin of the abductor hallucis. But further, we are now in a position to trace the external plantar artery and nerve as they pass outwards upon the mus- culus accessorius to the point where they were first seen-viz., in the interval between the abductor mmimi digiti and the flexor brevis digitorum.

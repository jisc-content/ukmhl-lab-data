1/2 THORAX. against the posterior wall; whilst the third lies to the left between the auriculo-ventricular and pulmonary openings. The valve which guards the mouth of the pulmonary artery is composed of three semilunar segments, and is called the semilunar or the sigmoid valve. By look- ing upwards into the lumen of the artery a view of these segments may be obtained, but it is better to defer their examination until the vessel itself has been studied. Pulmonary Artery.—This vessel has an oblique direction upwards, backwards, and to the left, so as to reach the lower aspect of the transverse portion of the aortic arch. It here divides into a rigJit and a left branch. At first it lies upon the root of the aorta, but, before it terminates, it is placed upon the left side of the ascending part of the aortic arch. In relation to each side of the pulmonary artery the dissector will notice the coronary artery and auricular appendix of that side. Up to the point where it bifurcates it is included within the pericardium, the serous layer forming a single tubular sheath for it and the ascend- ing aorta. The right pulmonary artery is somewhat longer than the left. It passes transversely outwards behind the aorta and superior vena cava to reach the root of the right lung, where it has already been dissected. The left pulmonary artery runs outwards in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to gain the root of the left lung. A strong fibrous cord—the obliterated

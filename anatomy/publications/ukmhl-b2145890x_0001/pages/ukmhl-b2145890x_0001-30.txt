UPPER LIMB. i8 Dissection of Axilla from the Front. The axillary space must now be dissected from the front. This is done by reflecting the clavicular part of the pectoralis major. The sternal portion of the muscle is upon no account to be disturbed. Divide the clavicular part close to its origin from the clavicle, and throw it downwards and outwards. This must be done with care, because some twigs from the external anterior thoracic nerve, and also some of the pectoral thoracic branches of the thoracic axis artery, enter its deep surface. All these must be thoroughly cleaned and preserved. • Costo-Ooracoid Membrane.—A space or gap bounded by the clavicle, pectoralis minor, pectoralis major, and coracoid process is now exposed. This gap, however, is closed by the costo-coracoid mem- brane, the connections of which must be studied. Trace it outwards to its coracoid attachment, and inwards to its costal attachment. Above it constitutes the sheath of the subclavius muscle by splitting into an anterior and a posterior layer. These passing upwards enclose the muscle and are attached, the one to the anterior border of the clavicle, and the other to the posterior border of the bone. But how can the two layers be demonstrated? Divide the anterior layer transversely close to the clavicle, and throwing it downwards, pass the handle of the scalpel upwards behind the muscle. The posterior attachment can in this manner be verified, and at the same time the nerve to the subclavius will be seen sinking into

THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. I/I these openings are situated at the base of the ventricle —the large oval auriculo-ventricular orifice lying to the right, close to the sharp right margin of the heart; and the pulmonary aperture being situated to the left and in front of the other at the summit of the conus arteriosus. But, further, both of these openings are guarded by valves, which act so as to give the blood its proper direction through the heart. The auriculo-ventricular valve, also called the tri- cuspid valve, is composed of three triangular pointed membranous segments, termed cusps. These are united by their bases so as to form an annular mem- brane, and through the intermediation of this they are fixed to the fibrous ring which - surrounds the auriculo-ventricular opening. In the intervals between these larger segments three smaller cusps may be detected. Each cusp is composed of two layers of endo- cardium, between which there is a certain amount of fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue is confined to the central portion of the cusp, the margins of which are therefore thin and translucent. Attached to the ventricular surface and margins of each segment are several of the chordae tendineae which have been seen to take origin from the apices of the papillary muscles. In consequence of this, the ventricular surface of the valve is rough, whilst the auricular surface—that sur- face over which the blood flows—is smooth. It is necessary, however, to note the relative posi- tion of these cusps. One is placed in relation to the anterior wall of the ventricle; another is placed

Il6 LOWER LIMB. The insertion of the sartorius, gracilis, and semiten- dinosus into the upper part of the inner surface of the tibia should again be examined. Observe how the sartorius overlaps the tendons of the other two, and how the tendon of the gracilis overlaps the upper part of the tendon of the semitendinosus. Synovial bursae separate these tendons from each other. The internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint will be seen extending downwards for a short distance upon the inner aspect of the shaft of the tibia. Pass- ing forwards under cover of this ligament, so as to gain the anterior aspect of the knee, are the inferior internal articular vessels and nerve. POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. BACK OF THE LEG. The limb must now be placed on its anterior aspect, and the muscles of the calf rendered tense by flexing the foot at the ankle-joint. This position should be maintained by the aid of hooks, fastened on the one hand to the toes and on the other hand to the under surface of the table. The following is a list of the structures which are met with in this dissection :â€” f Internal saphenous, (i.) Superficial veins. ^^^^^^^^ saphenous. (2.) Cutaneous nerves. Deep fascia. I ^ r Gastrocnemius. a ) Superficial muscles of the calf. \ Plantaris. ^ ' \ Soleus.

26 UPPER LIMB. In conjunction with this dissection it is also con- venient to study the triangular space in front of the elbow-joint and its contents. Reflection of Skin.—Two incisions are required : (i.) A vertical incision along the middle of the pro- jection formed by the biceps to a point fully three inches below the bend of the elbow. (2.) A transverse cut at right angles to the lower extremity of this, ex- tending: ridit across the forearm. Now raise the two flaps of skin and throw them outwards and inwards. Cutaneous Nerves. — The internal cutaneous branch of the musailo-spiral, the nerve of Wrisbergy and the twigs from third intercostal nerve and intercosto-humeral, are all to be traced to their terminations upon the inner aspect of the arm. The internal cutaneous nerve will be found piercing the deep fascia, to become superficial, about the middle of the arm on its inner aspect. Following this downwards, it will be found to divide into an anterior and posterior branch. The former passes down in front of the internal condyle, whilst the latter is directed down behind it. On the outer aspect of the arm secure the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral and the cutaneous portion of the musculo-cutaneous. The former will be found a short distance below the insertion of the deltoid, and the margin of the ex- ternal intermuscular septum is the best guide to it. It usually is in the form of two nerves, which become

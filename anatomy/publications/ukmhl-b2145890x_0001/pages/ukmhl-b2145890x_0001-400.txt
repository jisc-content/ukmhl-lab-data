174 ABDOMEN. diaphragm. The left vagus will be found lying upon the anterior aspect of the gullet. Trace it downwards and notice that it breaks up into branches, the great bulk of which spread out upon the anterior wall of the stomach; a few, however, run to the right, along the lesser curvature, and establish communications with the coronary plexus, whilst others ascend between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum to reinforce the hepatic plexus. The right vagus lies upon the posterior aspect of the gullet, and at once breaks up into numerous branches which ramify upon the pos- terior wall of the stomach ; it also sends twigs to the cceliacplexus and to the splenic plexus. The Solar or Epigastric Plexus.—In connection with the sympathetic system three large plexuses are formed in front of the vertebral column—viz., the cardiac plexus in the thorax, the solar plexus in the abdomen proper, and the hypogastric plexus in the pelvis. These collectively receive the name of the prevertebral plexuses. The solar plexus is by far the largest of the three. It is situated behind the stomach, in front of the aorta and the pillars of the diaphragm. Upon each side it extends as far as the suprarenal capsule, whilst inferiorly it is limited by the pancreas. On each side of the body, where it lies upon the crus of the dia- phragm, a large ganglionic mass, called the semi-lunar ganglion, is developed in its midst. Distinctive terms are applied to different parts of the plexus. The portion which connects the semi-lunar

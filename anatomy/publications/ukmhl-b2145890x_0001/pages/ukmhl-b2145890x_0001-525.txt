299 FEMALE PELVIS. it quits the bladder, and is continued round the pelvic wall. A very important point to notice is, that the peritoneal membrane is much more adherent to the wall of the uterus than it is to the wall of the bladder. Broad Ligament of the Uterus.—This is a wide fold of peritoneum which stretches from each lateral border of the uterus to the opposite part of the pelvic wall and iliac fossa. The superior border of the liga- ment is occupied by the Fallopian tube, the fimbriated free outer extremity of which opens into the peritoneal cavity. Here, therefore, a continuity is established between the mucous lining of the tube and the peri- toneal membrane. At a lower level than the Fallopian tube two secondary folds will be observed in connec- tion with the broad ligament. Of these one projects backwards and contains between its layers the ovary and its ligament, whilst the other is directed forwards and contains the roimd ligament of the uterus. From before backwards, then, the student will recognise be- tween the layers of the broad ligament— (i.) The round ligament of the uterus. (2.) The Fallopian tube. (3-) The ovary and its ligament. In addition to these more conspicuous objects, the two layers of the broad ligament include between them other structures, viz.—(i.) the parovarium; (2.) the uterine and ovarian vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. Recto-Vaginal Pouch, or the Pouch of Douglas.—This corresponds with the recto-vesical

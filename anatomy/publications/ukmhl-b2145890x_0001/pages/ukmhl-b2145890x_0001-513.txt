URETHRA. 287 then curves downwards. The urethra, therefore, in the flaccid condition of the penis, takes a course in which there are two curves, like the letter CO reversed. In the erect condition of the penis the curve in the spongy part of the canal is obliterated, and there is now only one curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. Vesiculse Seminales.â€”If the dissector has not already unravelled the vesiculae seminales, he should now do so, and, at the same time, endeavour to make out the composition of their walls. In addition to the recto-vesical fascia which ensheathes them, each vesi- cula has a strong dense fibrous tunic and a certain proportion of transverse and longitudinal non-striated muscular fibres. Open them up and expose the mu^ cous lining. This is remarkable for its honey-comb or reticular appearance. In this respect, therefore, it is not unlike the mucous membrane of the gall- bladder, only the meshes are finer and the pits smaller. Pelvic Articulations. The nerves and blood-vessels of the pelvis must now be removed, and all adhering portions of muscle detached from the left innominate bone and the front and back of the sacrum. When this is done the pelvis should be soaked for some time in warm water Py this proceeding the dissection of the ligaments will* be rendered much easier. The pelvis is fixed to the last lumbar vertebra, and

^8 ABDOMEN. roots of the transverse processes, and the intermediate lamella to the tips and adjacent sides of the transverse processes. Two aponeurotic compartments are thus formed, the posterior of which is occupied by the erector' spinae, whilst in the anterior is placed the quadratus lumborum. These are points which cannot be demonstrated in this dissection, but a reference to Fig. 10 will help the student to understand the arrange- ment. Anteriorly the fibres of the transversalis muscle end in a strong aponeurosis, which is inserted into the linea alba, the pubic crest, and the ilio-pectineal line. Towards this aponeurosis the fleshy fibres for the most part run in a transverse direction. The lower fibres, however, take a curved course downwards and inwards, so that the muscle presents a very distinctly .arched lower margin. The dissector has already seen that the lower portions of the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and the transversalis muscles blend to form the conjoined tendon. It is through the medium of this tendon that the transversalis gains its insertion into the pubic crest and into the ilio-pectineal line. Now â– examine the part which is played by the two factors of the conjoined tendon. You will notice that the aponeurosis of the transversalis constitutes the greater portion of it-indeed, whereas the internal oblique aponeurosis has an attachment to the ilio- pectineal line of little more than half-an-inch, the aponeurosis of the transversalis is fixed to fully an inch of this line.

ABDOMEN. 122 Having examined the form of the stomach, and learned the terms which are appHed to the different parts of it, the dissector is able to study its position within the abdominal cavity. It is placed in the costal zone, partly in the left hypochondrium and partly in the epigastric region. The hypochondriac portion of the stomach comprises fully three-fourths of the organ, and is vertical in direction, the fundus occupying the highest part of the region. The epigastric part of the stomach is transverse in direction, and comprises the remaining one-fourth of the organ. It lies about three-fingers breadth below the ensiform cartilage. It is important to note that the pyloric \ end of the stomach does not, under ordinary circum- stances, extend into the right hypochondrium, but gives place to the duodenum almost immediately after it has crossed the mesial plane.* At this stage it is useful to reflect upon the rela- tions which exist between the abdominal and thoracic organs which lie upon the different aspects of the diaphragm. Braune has made these very clear by a number of dissections performed from above. We have seen that the right lobe of the liver occupies the right vault of the diaphragm, whilst the left lobe of the liver, the fundus of the stomach and the spleen occupy the left vault. The base of the right lung is in relation to the right lobe of the liver. The peri- cardium, in by far the greater part of its extent, lies * A more extended account of the position and connections of the stomach will be found in Prof. Turner's "Introduction to Anatomy, from which the above description has been framed.

THE LIVER. l8l minal cavity, in order that he may study its form and the manner in which the vessels are distributed in its substance. Begin by dividing the ligamentum teres and the falciform ligament. Then drawing it downwards, cut through the lateral ligament on each side and the upper layer of the coronary ligament. Having done this, the bare area on its posterior border can be separated from the diaphragm with the handle of the knife. Observe that this portion of the liver is merely connected to the diaphragm by areolar tissue. Soon the vena cava inferior will be exposed, emerging from the posterior border of the liver, and then piercing the central tendon of the diaphragm. This must be severed. On dividing the lower layer of the coronary ligament, the liver will be free from all the surrounding parts, except the vena cava, at the point where it first comes in contact with the organ. The vena cava must, therefore, be cut a second time, and thus a portion of the vessel is taken away with the gland. Form of the Liver.â€”The liver is so irregular in form, that there is no object with which it can pro- perly be compared. Its transverse diameter measures about 10 to 12 inches, and its antero-posterior diameter from 6 to 7 inches. Its average weight may be stated to be somewhere between 50 to 60 ounces; or, as Bartholin has computed it, about i-36th of the total weight of the body. It is a solid, pliant organ, which readily adapts itself to changes in the bulk or position of the neighbouring viscera, and it has a dull reddish- brown colour.

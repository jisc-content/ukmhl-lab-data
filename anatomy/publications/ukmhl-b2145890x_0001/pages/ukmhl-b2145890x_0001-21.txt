PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 9 the deep surface of the muscle at the inferior angle of the scapula. Lastly, replace the outer portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle and fix it in position by a stitch or two around one or more of the ribs. This is done so as to preserve the posterior fold of the axilla. The dissector of the arm now stops work for two days. He has completed the dissection of all the dorsal structures which are allotted to him, and he has nothing further to do until the body is turned. PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. On resuming work the dissector will find the body lying upon its back. The chest is raised to a con- venient height by means of blocks. A long board is placed under the shoulders for the purpose of supporting the arms when they are abducted from the sides (PI. IV.). In dissecting the axilla and chest it will be found advantageous if the dissectors of the arm and head and neck arrange to work at different hours. The latter at this stage is engaged at the posterior triangle of the neck, and this dissection cannot be well done unless the arm be placed close to the side and the shoulder depressed. For the dissection of the axilla the arm should be stretched out at right angles to the chest. A compromise between these two positions always results in discomfort to both dissectors. In the dissection of the pectoral region and the

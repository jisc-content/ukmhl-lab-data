154 ABDOMEN. tightly upon a block by means of pins, with its mucous surface downwards, in order that its coats may be dissected. The jejunum is chosen because its wall is thicker than the ileum, and consequently the dissection is easier. The small intestine has five coats or strata entering into the formation of its walls, viz.:— (i.) Serous. (2.) Subserous. (3.) Muscular. (4.) Submucous. (5.) Mucous. The serotis coatifig of the jejunum and ileum is complete, except along the line of the mesenteric attachment. It is exceedingly thin—much thinner than the layers of the mesentery, with which it is continuous. Unless great care be taken in stripping it off, some of the subjacent muscular fibres will, be taken away with it. The subserous coat is a scarcely appreciable amount of areolar tissue which intervenes between the peritoneum and the muscular coat. The muscular coat is composed of involuntary non-striated muscular fibres. These are disposed in two layers— viz., an external stratum of longitudinal fibres, and an interfial stratum of circular fibres. Of these the circular layer is the thicker and more distinct of the two. The submucous coat is composed of loose areolar tissue which binds the muscular to the mucous coat. It is more firmly connected with the latter. The mucous coat must be examined throughout the whole length of the jejunum and ileum. The Mucous Membrane of the SmaU Intestine.

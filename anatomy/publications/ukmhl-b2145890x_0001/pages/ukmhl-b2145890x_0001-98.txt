LOWER LIMB. 86 fascia lata, which has been seen to recede behind it. Observe now the funnel-shaped appearance of the sheath—the wide mouth of the membranous tube pointing upwards into the abdomen, and the narrow inferior part gradually closing upon the vessels, and fusing with their coats about the level of the lower limit of the saphenous opening. If the dissection has been successfully performed, the crural branch of \h.^genito- cruralnQVJQ should be seen piercing the outer wall of the sheath, and the internal saphenous vein, and some lym- phatic vessels perforating its anterior and inner walls. Further, if the subject be spare, and the fasciae well ■ marked, the dissector will in all probability notice that the anterior wall of the sheath in its upper part is strengthened by some transverse fibres which pur- sue an arching course across it. To these fibres the name of deep crural airh is given, in contra-distinction to the term superficial crural arch, which is frequently applied to Poupart's ligament. The femoral sheath should now be opened so as to see the arrangement of parts inside. Make three vertical and parallel incisions through the anterior wall—one over the artery, another over the vein, and the third about half-an-inch internal to the second. The first two should begin at the level of Poupart's ligament, and should extend down- wards for an inch and a-half The most internal of the three incisions should commence at the same point, but should only be carried downwards for half-an-inch. The sheath will now be seen to be subdivided by two vertical partitions into three compartments. The

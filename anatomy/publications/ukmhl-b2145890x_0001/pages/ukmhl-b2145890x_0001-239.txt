The posterior layer of the triangular ligament {i.e., the parietal pelvic fascia opposite the pubic arch). Superficial Perineal Vessels and Nerves.— The superficial perineal vessels and nerves must now be followed out There are two arteries and three nerves to be looked for:— Arteries, i Superficial perineal artery. ( (2.) Transverse perineal artery. (i.) Posterior or internal superficial perineal nerve. Nerves. I ^^'^ interior or external superficial perineal (3.) The long pudendal nerve or the nerve of Soemmerring. The superficial perineal artery, a branch of the pudic, first pierces the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, and then the base of the triangular ligament, so as to gain the interior of the perineal pouch of fascia .It now crosses the transversus perinei muscle, and is continued forward in the interval between the acceler- ator urinae and erector penis to the scrotum, to the dartos muscle and integuments of which it is distri- buted in the form of numerous long, slender branches. Before it reaches the scrotum, it supplies twigs to the

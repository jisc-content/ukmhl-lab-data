89 FRONT OF THE THIGH. pectineus muscle. In this part of its course the femoral artery gives off—(i.) The three superficial inguinal vessels, which have already been observed ramifying in the superficial fascia of the groin ; (2.) The inferior externalpudic, which runs inwards over the pectineus ; (3.) The \-dx^& profunda femoris. The profunda femoris comes off from the outer side of the femoral artery about one and a-half inches below Poupart's ligament. It soon leaves the space by passing under cover of the adductor longus. The exter7ial and internal circumflex arteries will be seen to arise from the profunda within Scarpa's triangle. The external circumflex should be traced outwards as it passes amongst the branches of the anterior crural nerve to disappear under cover of the outer boundary of the space. The internal circumflex is lost to view shortly after its origin by sinking backwards between the pectineus and psoas muscles. The veins corre- sponding to these arteries must be cleaned along with them. But certain nerves are also to be found in this space —viz., (i.) the extejnial cutaneous; (2.) and the anterior crural. The external cutaneous will be found passing into the thigh under Poupart's ligament close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. It soon leaves the triangle by piercing the fascia lata, and it has already been traced in its ramifications in the superficial fascia on the outer aspect of the thigh. The anterior crural nerve will be detected lying deeply in the interval between the psoas and iliacus muscles, about a quarter of an inch to the outer side of the femoral artery.

LOWER LIMB. 130 It is customary to look upon the muscles and ten- 'dons which we find in the dissection of the sole as being disposed in four strata, viz.:— ^ Abductor hallucis. First layer, Flexor brevis digitorum. V. Abductor minimi digiti. / Tendon of flexor longus digitorum. , , 1 Musculus accessorius. becond layer. < _ , . , , j Lumbrical muscles. V Tendon of flexor longus hallucis. r Flexor brevis hallucis. Third layer. 3 Adductor hallucis. , I Transversus pedis. V Flexor brevis minimi digiti. I" Interosseous muscles. Fourth layer. < Tendon of the peroneus longus. ' Tendon of tibialis posticus. Superficial Muscles—Plantar Vessels and "Nerves.—The lateral portions of the plantar fascia should now be raised from the subjacent muscles. The three superficial muscles of the sole are then exposed to view and their connections can be studied. The flexor brevis digitorum is placed in the middle, the abductor minimi digiti extends along the outer margin of the sole, and the abductor hallucis along the inner margin of the sole. In the interval between the abductor hallucis and. flexor brevis digitorum the inteimal plantar nerve and \ artery will be found. Follow the nerve towards the: toes and dissect out its various digital branches. These: will be observed to be four in number, and to be.'

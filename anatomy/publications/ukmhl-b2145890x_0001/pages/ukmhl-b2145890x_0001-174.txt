THORAX. l62 the interval between them. You will observe a promi- nent fold of serous pericardium. This is " the vestigial fold of Marshall;' the remnant of the left superior vena cava of the embryo. The branches of the superficial cardiac plexus may now be traced downwards. They descend in the groove between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and being joined by some twigs from the deep cardiac plexus, they are distributed upon the heart in connec- tion with the left coronary artery, and under the name of the anterior coronary plexus. Innominate Veins — Superior Vena Cava.— The imiominate vein of each side is formed behind the sternal extremity of the clavicle by the union of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. A little way below the first costal cartilage of the right side they unite to form the superior vena cava. The right i7inominate vein is short and has a nearly vertical course. Its outer surface is clothed by pleura, and is in relation to the phrenic nerve. Internally it is in contact with the innominate artery. The left innomi- nate vein is much longer, and has an oblique course. In order to bring it into view it is necessary to remove the fatty areolar tissue which, in the adult, is the only representative of the thymus gland. The vein will then be seen to cross the three great arteries which spring from the transverse part of the aortic arch. If care has been taken in cleaning these veins several tributaries will be observed joining each of them, viz.—(I.) the inferior thyroid vein ; (2.) the internal mammary vein ; (3.) the superior intercostal Y^m.

SHOULDER—SCAPULAR REGION. 21 of the saw and bone pliers. This is done so that both dissectors may obtain a connected view of the structures which pass from the side of the neck into the axilla. Removal of the Arm from the Body.—The upper limb may now be removed from the trunk. Tie the axillary vessels and nerves together in a bunch at two points a short distance from each other and at the level of the clavicle, and then divide them between the ligatures. Now draw the arm forcibly from the side and cut through the latissimus dorsi, serratus magnus,* levator anguli scapulae (if it has not been previously divided), and omo-hyoid muscles, and also the suprascapular artery and nerve, and the nerves and vessels which go to the deep surface of the trapezius. The arm will then be found to be free, and it should be carried to one of the tables which are reserved for the dissection of separate parts. SHOULDER-SCAPULAR REGION. This dissection comprises the following parts :— (i.) Cutaneous nerves of the shoulder. (2.) Deltoid muscle. (3.) Subacromial bursa. (4.) Anterior and posterior circumflex arteries. (5.) Circumflex nerve. (6.) Dorsalis scapulae artery. (7.) Subscapularis muscle. * As this is the best time to study the serratus magnus, the dissector should examine it thoroughly before dividing it.

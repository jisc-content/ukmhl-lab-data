FRONT-AND INNER BORDER OF FOREARM. 39 the flexor sublimis digitorum and the flexor carpi ulnaris. It passes from the forearm into the palm by crossing the anterior annular ligament under shelter of the pisiform bone, and here it is bound down, with the ulnar nerve, to the ligament by a strong band of fascia, which is derived from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The student is very apt to mistake these strong fibres for the anterior annular ligament itself. The ulnar artery gives off the following branches:—(i.) The anterior ulnar recurrent^ which runs upwards in front of the internal condyle of the humerus ; (2.) The posterior ulnar recurrent^ which passes deeply under cover of the flexor sublimis and then upwards between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the interval between the olecranon and the internal condyle; (3.) The interosseotis, which passes directly backwards and almost immediately divides into its anterior and posterior branches. These cannot be traced at present; (4.) Muscular bra?iches; (5.) The anteidor and posterior carpal arteries. Nerves.—The ulnar nerve must be followed up- wards to the point at which it enters the forearm between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Its branches of supply to that muscle and to the inner part of the flexor profundus digitorum are given off" high up in the forearm. Its articular twigs come off as it lies in the interval between the olecranon and the internal condyle of the humerus. The radial nerve will be seen springing from the musculo-spiral as the

The anterior tibial artery is one of the two terminal branches of the popliteal, and it gains the front of the leg by passing forwards through the opening in the upper part of the interosseous membrane. It is an exceedingly difficult vessel to display owing to the close manner in which it is embraced by its two vencB comites and the short transverse communicating veins which pass between these both in front and behind the artery. It is not necessary, however, to preserve these small transverse veins. Observe the great depth at which the anterior tibial artery is placed in the upper part of the leg. Here it lies upon the interosseous membrane between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum in the first instance, but afterwards between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus hallucis. As the fleshy bellies of the muscles give place to the tendons which spring from them, the artery will be seen to become more superficial and to lie upon the tibia. Immediately above the ankle-joint it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis, and now passing under cover of the anterior annular ligament it enters the dorsum of the foot, and receives the name of arteria dorsalis pedis. The anterior tibial nerve will be noticed to lie in close re- lation to the artery throughout its whole course in the leg, and, in cleaning the vessel and its branches, care must be taken of the twigs which are given by this nerve to the neighbouring muscles. The anterior tibial artery gives off the following branches:â€” (i.) Numerous muscular branches.

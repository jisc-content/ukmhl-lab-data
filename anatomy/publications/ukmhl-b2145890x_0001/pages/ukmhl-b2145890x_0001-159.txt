THORACIC WALL. ages. Towards the lower margin of the thorax the pleural sac is not prolonged downwards to the lowest limit of the recess between the diaphragm and the costal arches. Indeed, in the axillary line, it will be found to fall short of this by about two or two and a-half inches. Consequently, when the internal inter- costal muscles are removed from this portion of the chest wall, the dissector will come down directly upon the diaphragm, and as the fibres of the diaphragm correspond somewhat in their direction with those of the internal intercostal muscles, it is no uncommon occurrence for the student to remove them, and thus expose the peritoneum, under the impression that he has simply laid bare the pleura. When the dissection has been properly executed, a thin fascia will be observed to pass from the surface of the diaphragm on to the surface of the costal pleura so as to hold it in position. Triangularis Sterni and Internal Mammary- Artery.â€”The triangularis sterni muscle should be studied at this stage of the dissection. A tolerably good idea of its connections can be obtained without dividing costal cartilages, a step which is frequently recommended. Lying on its superficial aspect are the series of intercostal nerves and the internal mammary artery. The i^iternal mammary artery should be followed downwards in the intervals between the cartilages. It lies fully half-an-inch to the outside of the margin of the sternum, and is accompanied by two veins. In

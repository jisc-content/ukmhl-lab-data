MALE PERINEUM. 13 by the junction of the anal fascia with the parietal or obturator layer of the pelvic fascia (Fig. 2, p. 10). Further, if the anal fascia be removed, its entrance into the pelvis is still resisted by the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which at this level passes inwards from the parietal pelvic fascia, and also by the levator ani muscle which lies on the lower surface of the visceral pelvic fascia and takes origin from the line of union between these two layers of fascia. Internal Pudic Vessels and Nerve.—The dis- sector should now pass his finger upwards and down- wards over the surface of the parietal or obturator layer of the pelvic fascia, which covers the obtur- ator internus muscle and forms the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. About an inch and a-half above the lower border of the ischial tuberosity he will feel very distinctly the pudic vessels and nerve as they pass forwards to gain the urethral triangle. In this position they are enclosed in a tube or sheath formed by the parietal pelvic fascia. The student must for the present be satisfied with this partial view of these struc- tures. To expose them would necessitate the division of the parietal pelvic fascia, and this should be kept entire until the pelvic fascia can be studied as a whole. Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Vessels and Nerve.— The inferior or external hcBinorrhoidal arteries are branches of the internal pudic. They are usually two or three in number, and, piercing the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, they pass inwards through the fat of the ischio-rectal fossa to supply the lower end of the

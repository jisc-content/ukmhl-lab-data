ABDOMEN. with the subjacent bone. Make an incision into it with the knife, and one or more bursae will be dis- played intervening between the fascia and bone. These bursal sacs are frequently intersected by strong fibrous bands or cords. In this locality the superficial fascia acts as a cushion on which the tuber ischii rests when the body is in the sitting posture. But, again, if the superficial fascia be now followed forwards over the urethral triangle, another change in its character becomes manifest. The further forwards we proceed, the scarcer becomes the fat which it con- tains in its meshes, and in the scrotum the fat entirely disappears and gives place to a thin layer of involun- tary muscular fibres. These constitute the dartos muscle, and are recognised by their ruddy colour. The rugosity of the scrotal integument is caused by the contraction of these fibres. In the anterior part of the perineum the superficial fascia possesses certain very definite attachments. To elucidate these it is customary for anatomists to consider that it consists of two layersâ€”a superficial fatty stratum and a deep membranaceous stratum. It is very true that towards the skin this fascia is usually fatty, whilst its deeper surface appears more condensed and aponeurotic, still it is ana- tomically one structure, and its separation into layers is more or less artificial. The attachments of the superficial fascia are effected by its deep surface, and are the following (i.) upon each side to the anterior lip of the rami of the pubis and ischium ; (2.) inferiorly to the base of the triangular ligament.

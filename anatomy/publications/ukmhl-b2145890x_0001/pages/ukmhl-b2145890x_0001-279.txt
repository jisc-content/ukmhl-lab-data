ABDOMINAL WALL. the chest Following it downwards, it will be noticed to become more strongly marked, and to acquire a greater density. Towards the lower part of the abdomen it is customary to describe it as being composed of two layersâ€”a fatty superficial stratum and a deep membranaceous stratum ; but we regard this as a useless complication. It is true that the fat is not equally distributed throughout its substance, that it is chiefly found in its superficial meshes, and that consequently its deep surface has a mem- branaceous appearance ; but this is no reason why we we should look upon it as consisting of two separate strata. There is one point, however, in which this fascia differs somewhat from the same fascia in other parts of the body. It is more elastic ; and this elasticity is due to the presence of elastic fibres in its deeper membranaceous part. Over the lower part of the linea alba the elastic tissue is often seen collected in the form of a distinct band. A reference to compara- tive anatomy gives interest to this fact. In the human subject this elastic band is the rudimentary representative of a continuous and distinct layer of yellow elastic tissue {the abdominal tunic), which is present in the horse. But what becomes of the superficial fascia if we follow it downwards from the front of the abdomen ? On each side it is continued over Poupart's ligament and enters the region of the thigh, and opposite the pubes it is carried, over the penis and spermatic cords, to the scrotum and perineum, where it has already

ABDOMEN. downwards and inwards to the neck of the uterus. At th,s point it gives several small branches to the vagina and bladder, and, changing its direction, extends upwards in a tortuous manner along the ateral border of the uterus and between the two- layers of the broad ligament. Reaching the fundus, it sends several twigs outwards into the broad ligament â€¢ ol these, one accompanies the round ligament, another goes w,th the Fallopian tube, and several proceed to the ovaiy, and anastomose with twigs from the ovarian arteo'. Whilst in contact with the lateral border ' of the uterus, the uterine artery gives numerous branches to this organ, and these, from their taking a somewhat spiral course in its substance, are frequently spoken of as the " curling arteries of the uterus." The Vaginal Artery also springs from the anterioft division of the internal iliac, but it is not unusual for It to arise in common with the uterine arteiy. or the middle haemorrhoidal. It is distributed to the vagina and sends twigs to the adjacent rectum and bladder. ' The Ovarian Artery.-The course which this vessel takes within the abdomen proper is described at p. 208. When it arrives at the pelvis, it insinuates Itself between the two layers of the broad ligament of the uterus, and becoming highly tortuous, runs towards the anterior border of the ovary Here, it breaks up into numerous branches, which sink into the substance of this organ. In addition to these It sends a twig to the Fallopian tube, another to the round ligament, and several towards the uterus.

ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 117 small intestine are smooth and uniform, whereas the walls of the great intestine are puckered and sacculated. (3.) The longitudinal muscular fibres in the wall of the great intestine are not disposed uniformly around the tube as in the small intestine, but are collected into three bands, which are separated from each other by intervals, and are distinctly visible to the naked eye. These bands are shorter than the tube itself, and this is the reason of its walls being puckered. (4.) Attached to the great intestine are appendices epiploicce. These are small peritoneal pouches or folds, which hang from the gut and contain fat. On opening the abdominal cavity, the student obtains a very partial view of the contained viscera, so long as they are left undisturbed. On the right side of the costal zone the sharp margin of the liver may be observed projecting slightly below the ribs, whilst opposite the ninth costal cartilage the fundus of the gall-bladder is seen peeping out from under cover of this organ, and projecting slightly beyond Its anterior border. In the same zone, to the left of the liver, a portion of the stomach is visible, whilst extending downwards from the lower border of this viscus is a broad fold of peritoneal membrane, called the o^nentum. This usually contains a quantity ot fat in Its meshes, and is spread out like an apron, so as to hide from view the viscera which occupy the two lower zones. Sometimes, however, the great omentum is narrow and short; or, again, it may be turned more or less completely upwards or tp the side. In either case some of the coils of the small

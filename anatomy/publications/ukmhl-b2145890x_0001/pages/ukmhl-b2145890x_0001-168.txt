With the consent of the dissector of the head and neck, he may introduce the nozzle of the bellows into the cervical portion of the .trachea and inflate them with air. He will, in this way, be able to form a truer conception of these organs than he would by simply examining them in their present collapsed condition.

These structures are held together by an investment of pleura, and thus constitute a pedicle which retains the lung in its place. The pleura should be carefully stripped from around the root of the lung ; but, before undertaking the dis- section of the parts which compose the root, the relation which it bears to neighbouring parts should be determined. In front, there are—(i.) A delicate plexus of nerves, the anterior pulmonary plexus ; and (2.) The phrenic nerve with the arteria comes nervi phrenici.

These are the relations which are common to the root of the lung upon each side of the body, but there are others which belong specially to the side that we are examining. On the right side—(i.)

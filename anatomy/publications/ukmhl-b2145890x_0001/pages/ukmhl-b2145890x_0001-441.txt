FASCIA ILIACA. 215 firmly fixed to the crest of the ilium, whilst internally it sweeps over the psoas, and is attached to the brim of the true pelvis. These attachments can be easily demonstrated by dividing it in the vertical direction, over the iliacus, a short way to the outer side of the psoas. It is very loosely attached to the subjacent muscles, so that the fingers can readily be passed be- hind it, first in an outward and then in an inward direction. Note that no perceptible fascial partition dips backwards from it between the psoas and iliacus. The inferior connections of this fascia have already been studied (p. 108). On the outer side of the iliac vessels it has been seen to become continuous with the fascia transversalis, and, at the same time, to be attached to Poupart's ligament; whilst behind these vessels it is carried downwards into the thigh, to form the posterior wall of the femoral sheath. Dissection.—The muscles should now be cleaned and their attachments defined ; but, in doing this, certain points must be attended to. The inner portion of the fascia iliaca must be carefully preserved, in order that its relation to the pelvic fascia may be afterwards made out. In the case of the psoas muscle^ great care must be taken not to injure—(i.) the sympathetic cord, which lies along its inner margin; (2.) the genito- crural nerve, which runs downwards in front of it; (3.) the ilio-hypogastric, the ilio-inguinal, and the external cutaneous nerves, which appear at its outer border, and the anterior crural nerve, which lies in the interval between it and the iliacus muscle. In the case of the

308 ABDOMEN. above the vagina. In shape, it is pyriform or flask- shaped, flattened from before backwards. In length, it is about three inches; in breadth, at the broadest point, two inches ; and in thickness, nearly an inch. The broader upper end of the uterus is directed upwards and forwards, whilst its narrow lower end looks downwards and backwards, and forms with the vagina an obtuse angle, which is open towards the pubis. The long axis of the organ may be said to correspond with that of the pelvic inlet. It is customary to describe the uterus as being composed of three partsâ€”viz., a fundus, a body, and a neck or cervix. The fundus is the rounded upper end. The Fal- lopian tube enters the organ on each side at its upper angle, and a line drawn transversely between these is arbitrarily fixed upon as the limit between the fundus and the body of the uterus. The body diminishes in breadth as it proceeds downwards towards the neck. In front and behind it is smooth and convex, the convexity of the posterior surface, however, being more marked than that of the anterior surface. Upon each side it is joined imme- diately below the entrance of the Fallopian tube, in front by the round ligament, and behind by the ligament of the ovary. Inferiorly, the body of the uterus is marked off from the neck by a slight con- striction, which is very apparent in the infant, but which becomes less distinct as puberty approaches, and usually disappears altogether after parturition. The neck or cervix, about an inch in length, is

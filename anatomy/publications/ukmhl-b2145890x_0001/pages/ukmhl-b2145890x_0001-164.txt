THORAX. 152 the ribs as far forward as the cartilages. This can best be done by gently insinuating the forefinger between each of the ribs and the pleura, and then running it backwards and forwards. Upon no account detach the pleura from the cartilages. Next divide with the knife the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth costal arches at the junction of the osseous with the cartilaginous portions, and remove these ribs by snipping through them with the bone pliers as far back as possible. The sternum and cartilages, to which the pleura is still adherent, must be left in position until the arrangement of the membrane has been thoroughly investigated. The greater part of the costal pleura now lies flaccid upon the surface of the lung. Make a vertical incision through it, midway between the spine and sternum, from the level of the second costal arch down as far as the seventh rib. From each extremity of this vertical cut carry an incision forwards for two or three inches. A considerable piece of the parietal pleura can now be thrown forwards like a door, and the hand can be introduced into the pleural sac so as to explore its extent and connections. First cany it inwards behind the cartilages. Its passage across the middle line of the body is effectually barred by the reflection of the pleura from the back of the sternum to the front of the pericardium. By separating the pleura from the pericardium with the handle of the knife or with the fingers, the pleura can be traced back- wards upon the lateral aspect of the pericardium

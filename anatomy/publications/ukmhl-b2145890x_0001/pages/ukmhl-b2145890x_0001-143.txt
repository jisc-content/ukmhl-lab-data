SOLE OF THE FOOT. I31 distributedâ€”(a) to the tibial side of the great toe; (b) to the adjacent sides of the great toe and the second toe ; {c^ to the adjacent sides of the second and third toes ; and {d.) to the adjacent margins of the third and fourth toes. In order to trace these nerves forwards to their distribution, it is necessary to remove the integuments from the digits by making an incision along the middle of each and then throwing the skin outwards and inwards. With the exception of the nerve which supplies the third and fourth toes, each of the other three digital trunks gives off a minute muscular twig before it bifurcates, and these must be sought for with care. The first digital nerve supplies an offset to the flexor brevis hallucis, the second digital nerve gives a twig to the first lumbrical muscle, and the third nerve sends a branch to the second lumbrical. Now trace the trunk of the internal plantar nerve backwards by carefully separating the flexor brevis digitorum and the abductor hallucis along the line of the internal intermuscular septum. It will be found to give a branch of supply to each of these muscles. The internal plantar artery which accompanies the nerve of the same name is a small vessel, and may be traced as far as the inner side of the great toe. Turn your attention in the next place to the outer margin of the sole, and carefully separate the contiguous borders of the flexor brevis digitorum and abductor minimi digiti. The external plantar artery and nerve lie for a short portion of their course in the interval between these muscles. Approaching the prominent

52 ABDOMEN. rounded, and protuberant appearance; if, on the other hand, it is spare, the abdominal wall is depressed, and the lower margin of the thorax above, and the pubes, crest of the ilium, and Poupart's ligament below, stand out in marked relief. In the middle line, the student will ■ notice a linear depression extending downwards towards the symphysis. This corresponds with the linea alba or the intei-val between the two recti muscles. It is a most important line to the surgeon, because here the wall of the abdomen is very thin and devoid of blood-vessels, and, in consequence, it is chosen as the site for the incisions in the operations of ovariotomy, Caesarian section, and supra-pubic lithotomy. In the same line the trocar is introduced into the abdomen in the operation of paracentesis abdominis or tapping. In this linear depression, rather nearer the pubes than the ensiform cartilage, is the umbilicus or navel This is a depressed and puckered cicatrix, the floor of which is raised in the form of a little button-like knob. It results from the closure of a foramen in the abdom- inal wall of the foetus, through which passed the con- stituents of the umbilical cord—viz., the umbilical vein, the two umbilical arteries, and the urachus. In powerful well-developed subjects the rectus muscle stands out on each side of the middle line, and its outer margin gives rise to a curved line, the con- cavity of which is directed inwards. This line corre- sponds to the linea semilunaiHs—Le., the line along which the aponeurotic tendon of the internal oblique muscle splits to enclose the rectus.

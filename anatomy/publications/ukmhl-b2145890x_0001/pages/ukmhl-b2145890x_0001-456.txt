230 ABDOMEN. bladder, it is raised in the form of two semi-lunar and horizontal ridges or folds by the obliterated hypo- gastric arteries. These folds extend forwards one on each side of the rectum, and they limit laterally a deep peritoneal pouch or recess between the rectum and bladder, which, from its position, is called the recto-vesical pouch. False Ligaments of the Bladder.—Wherever the peritoneum leaves the bladder to reach the pelvic or abdominal wall, it is termed " a false ligament." Of these,/z;^ are described—viz., two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior false ligaments, or recto-vesical folds, are the two semi-lunar folds which limit the recto- vesical pouch laterally. They are produced, as we have seen, by the peritoneum being stretched over the obliterated hypogastric artery as it passes forwards to reach the bladder. Within each of these folds, future dissection will reveal, in addition to the impervious hypogastric artery, the ureter and the superior vesical artery accompanied by some minute nerves. The lateral false ligament is the name given to the peritoneum as it passes from each side of the bladder to the wall of the pelvis and the iliac fossa. This reflection has been seen to take place along the line of the obliterated hypogastric artery as it lies upon the lateral aspect of the bladder. The superior false ligament is the portion of peritoneum which is continued from the summit of

68 LOWER LIMB. will be seen to be assisted by the small planiaris muscle. In cleaning these muscles there are certain points to be attended to. In the case of the outer head of the gastrocnemius, care must be taken not to remove the nervus communicans fibnlaris nerve, which passes downwards and inwards upon its surface. In the groove between the heads of this muscle will be seen the nervus communicans tibialis. Further, the dissector must not overk>ok the synovial bursa which intervenes between the tendon of the semimembranosus and the inner head of the gastrocnemius. This bursa some- times communicates with a second synovial sac, which will be brought into view by lifting the inner head of the gastrocnemius. It will be obsei-ved to be interposed between this muscle ^and the inner condyle.

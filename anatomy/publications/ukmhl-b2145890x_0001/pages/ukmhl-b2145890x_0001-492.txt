266 ABDOMEN. surface of the levator ani, the connections of which can now be studied. In cleaning the coccygeus, be careful not to injure the fifth sacral nerve and the coccygeal nerve, both of which pierce it near its insertion. Levator Ani.â€”The levator ani is a thin sheet of muscular fibres, and forms the anterior and greater part of the pelvic diaphragm. It has a triple origin. The anterior fibres spring from the back of the body of the pubic bone between the attachments of the visceral and parietal layers of pelvic fascia; the posterior fibres arise from the pelvic surface of the ischial spine ; whilst the intermediate fibres, constituting the greater part of the muscle, take origin from the " white line " of the pelvic fascia, in the angle between the perineal portion of the parietal layer and the visceral layer. The insertion of the levator ani must also be looked at from three points of view. The anterior fibres proceed downwards upon the lateral aspect of the prostate; and from the support which they give to it, they are frequently spoken of under the name oi levator prostates. Behind the prostate they meet, in the mesial plane, with the corresponding fibres of the opposite side, and are inserted into the central point of the perineum. The intermediate and largest portion of the muscle descends upon the side of the rectum, into which it is inserted, some of the fibres mingling with those of the external sphincter. The posterior fibres are inserted into a median raphe

58 LOWER LIMB. direction of the muscular fibres, which in this case corresponds with a line drawn from the sacrum to the great trochanter. (4.) Define very carefully the borders of the muscle. The gluteus maximus is a difficult muscle to clean, the fasciculi are so exceedingly coarse and rough. To do it well, it is not sufficient to remove the fascia which covers the muscle, but it is necessary at the same time to follow, for a short distance, the septa which penetrate between the fasciculi, and to remove them also. The dissector of the left limb, on reaching the anterior margin of the muscle, will observe that the fascia which he holds in his hand is continuous with the strong aponeurosis which covers the gluteus medius; and further, if he now frees the anterior border of the muscle from subjacent parts, he will notice that the layer of fascia upon which the gluteus maximus rests is also continuous with the same aponeurosis. In other words, he will in this manner be able to satisfy himself that the strong fascia which covers the anterior part of the gluteus medius splits into two layers to enclose the gluteus maximus. The small sciatic nerve lies in very close relation to the deep surface of the muscle, not far from the posterior border, and is very apt to be injured in the subsequent steps of the dissection, unless it be secured at once by everting the posterior border of the muscle. Reflection of Gluteus Maximus.â€”This is the next step in the dissection of this region, and it is one which demands the utmost care upon the part of the

41 PALM OF THE HAND. Deep Muscles.—Clean and study the connections of the deep muscles. These are the flexor profundus digitorum on the inside, the flexor longus pollicis to the outer side, and the pronator quadratus muscle which lies over the lower ends of the bones. Lastly, follow the anterior interosseous artery downwards, dissect out the two nutrient branches which it gives to the bones of the forearm, and notice how it sends its perforating branch backwards through the interosseous membrane near the level of the upper border of the pronator quadratus. PALM OF THE HAND. Here we find :— (i.) Palmaris brevis and two cutaneous nerves. (2.) Palmar fascia. (3.) Superficial palmar arch and its branches. (4.) Median and ulnar nerves and their branches. (5.) Anterior annular ligament, the flexor tendons, and the flexor sheaths. (6.) Lumbrical muscles. (7.) Short muscles of the thumb and little finger. (8.) Deep palmar arch and its branches. (9.) Arteria princeps pollicis and arteria radialis indicis. Reflection of Skin.—Incisions.—(i.) A vertical incision along the middle line of the palm. (2.) A transverse cut at the extremity of this from the ulnar to the radial margin of the palm across the roots of the fingers. The skin is tightly bound down to the subjacent deep fascia. The transverse ligament at the roots of the fingers should be noticed as the skin is being reflected.

54 LOWER LIMB. Supposing that two days are allowed for the above dissection, \h<t first day's work should consist—(i.) In the dissection of the parts superficial to the gluteus maximus; (2.) In the cleaning and reflecting of this muscle ; (3.) In tracing and defining the various nerves and blood-vessels which enter its deep surface. On the second day the parts which are exposed by the reflection of the gluteus maximus should be dissected. Reflection of ^^Ti—hicisions.—ii) From the posterior superior spine of the ilium in a curved direction outwards, following the crest of the ilium, as far forwards as the position of the body will permit. (2.) From the posterior extremity of this curved incision obliquely downwards and inwards to the middle line of the sacral region, and then perpendicularly down- wards to the tip of the coccyx. (3.) From the tip of the coccyx obliquely downwards and outwards over the back of the thigh in a direction parallel to, but at a lower level than, the fold of the nates. (PI. III. p. 2, and PI. I.) A large flap of skin is thus marked out, and this must be raised from the subjacent superficial fascia and thrown outwards. On the right side of the body the dissector begins at the crest of the ilium and works downward and forwards, whilst on the left side he commences over the coccyx and works upwards | and forwards. Superficial Fascia.—The superficial fascia is now exposed, and it is seen to partake of the same characters

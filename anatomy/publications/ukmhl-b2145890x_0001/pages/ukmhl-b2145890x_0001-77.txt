POPLITEAL SPACE. 65 between the muscle and the small sciatic notch. We further observe how the little ridges of the cartila- ginous coating of the notch fit into fissures in the deep aspect of the tendon of the muscle. The quadratus femoris should be detached from the tuberosity of the ischium and thrown outwards towards its femoral attachment. This proceeding gives us a more extensive view of the obturator externus muscle. Before the muscles on the back of the thigh are disturbed, it is well to dissect the popliteal space. In this way the boundaries of the space are maintained in position during our examination of the structures which lie within it. The following is a list of the structures which require to be studied :â€” (i.) Superficial fascia. (2.) External saphenous vein. (3.) Small sciatic nerve. (4.) Popliteal fascia. (6.) The internal and external popliteal nerves and their branches. . (7.) The popliteal artery and vein and their branches. (8.) A few lymphatic glands. ' (9.) A slender branch from the obturator nerve. (10.) The popliteus muscle. POPLITEAL SPACE. (5.) Muscles which bound the space. I Biceps. Semitendinosus. Semimembranosus. Gastrocnemius. Plantaris. F

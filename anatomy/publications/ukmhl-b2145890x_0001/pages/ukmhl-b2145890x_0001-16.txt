4 UPPER LIMB. above the level of the prominent spine of the seventh cervical vertebra is the property of the dissector of the head and neck, and must be cleaned by him. Let the two dissectors work in conjunction with each other, and, when the entire muscle is exposed, let each give the other an opportunity of studying it in its entirety. In cleaning the trapezius the limb must be placed in such a position as will render the fibres of the muscle tense. Let us suppose that the dissection is to be made upon the right side of the body. In this case the arm must be placed close to the side, and drawn well downwards whilst the scapula is dragged forwards. A transverse cut is now to be made through the superficial and deep fasciae from the spine of the seventh cei-vical vertebra outwards. This incision will be found to coincide with the direction of the fibres at this level. From this point gradually work downwards, raising both fasciae in a continuous layer from the surface of the muscle. In doing this always keep the knife sweeping in the direction of the muscular fibres, and take care to leave none of the filmy deep fascia behind. If this rule be attended to, it will be found that as the dissection progresses the knife is not, as at first, being carried transversely but obliquely, in accord- ance with the direction of the^fibres of the lower portion of the muscle. And now the position of the arm must be changed, in order that these oblique fibres may be placed on the stretch. The scapula must still be kept as far forward as possible, but the limb must be carried upwards and placed parallel with the neck.

ABDOMINAL AORTA. 205 vein. (4.) The peritoneum and the aortic plexus of nerves. Superficial to these it is covered by the gastro-hepatic omentum and the stomach, the trans- verse colon and its mesentery, and by the great omentum, and the coils of the small intestine. Behind, the abdominal aorta rests upon the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and the intervertebral discs, separated from them, however, by the anterior common ligament and the left lumbar veins. On each side it is related in its upper part to the crus of the diaphragm. On the right side the vena cava lies close to the aorta as high as the second lumbar vertebra, but above this it is separated from it by the fleshy part of the right crus. In the interval between the right crus of the diaphragm and the vessel the student has already noted the receptaculum chyli and the vena azygos major. On the left side, the left )(\ gangliated cord of the sympathetic is in relation to the artery below the level of the left crus. Branches of the Abdominal Aorta.—The branches of the abdominal aorta may be described under two heads, viz.—(i.) Those which come off in pairs. (2.) Those which arise singly. Paired Branches. Single Branches. (1.) Inferior phrenic arteries, (i.) The coeliac axis. (2.) Middle capsular ar- (2.) The superior mesenteric. teries. (3.) Renal arteries. (4.) Spermatic ,or ovarian (3.) The inferior mesenteric. (4.) The middle sacral. arteries. (5.) Lumbar arteries.

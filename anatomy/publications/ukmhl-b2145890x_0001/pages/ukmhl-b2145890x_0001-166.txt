154 THORAX. interpleural space which lies above the pericardium. In front it is bounded by the manubrium sterni, to the upper and posterior aspect of which the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are attached; behind, by the vertebrae ; and laterally, by the pleura.* Introduce the hand a second time into the pleural sac, and pass it upwards. The pleura will be observed to extend upwards into the root of the neck, and to form in this locality a dome-shaped roof for each side of the chest. The height to which the cervical pleura rises above the level of the first rib varies from one inch to one inch and a-half The subclavian artery arches over this cul-de-sac, and the scalenus anticus muscle is in relation to its outer surface. In the next place, enlarge the opening in the pleural sac, and draw the basal portion of the lung outwards and upwards. The pleura will be seen to clothe the upper surface of the diaphragm [diaphragmaticpleura), and a triangular fold of pleural membrane extending from the lower border of the root of the lung to the diaphragm will be brought into view. This fold is called the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The term mediastinal pleura is given to that portion * If this method of description be adopted, the superior mediastinum must be considered to contain the following structures :â€” (I.) The remains of the thymus body. (2.) The two innominate veins, the commencement of the superior vena cava, and the termination of the vena azygos major. (3.) The transverse portion of the aortic arch and the three great arteries which spring from it. (4.) The pneumogastric, phrenic, cardiac, and left recurrent laryngeal nerves for a certain part of their course. (5.) Portions of the trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct.

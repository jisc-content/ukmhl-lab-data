ABDOMINAL AORTA. 20/ of which they sink. On the right side the middle capsular artery passes behind the vena cava. They anastomose freely with the superior and inferior capsular arteries. The right capsular vein opens into the vena cava, whilst the left vein ends in the renal or phrenic vein. The Renal Arteries, when compared with the organs which they supply, are disproportionately large. Only a small part of the blood which they carry to the kidneys is used for the nourishing of the gland substance. The kidneys are the great excretory organs for the waste nitrogenous materials of the body, and it is necessary that the blood should pass to them in large quantity in order that it may be purified. The renal arteries take origin about a quarter of an inch below the superior mesenteric. Each artery proceeds outwards at right angles to the aorta, and, approaching the kidney, breaks up into four or five branches, which enter the hilus. It is overlapped by the accompanying vein. Seeing that the aorta lies a little to the left of the mesial plane, the right renal artery is the longer of the two; the right artery also passes behind the vena cava. Again examine the relation of parts at the hilus. From before backwards we find:— (i.) Veins. (2.) Arteries. (3.) Ureter. The renal artery gives a small twig—//.^ inferior capsular—to the suprarenal body.

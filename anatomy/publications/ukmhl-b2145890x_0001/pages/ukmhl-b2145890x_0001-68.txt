^6 LOWER LIMB. both superficial and deep fasciae, so as to secure them as they emerge from the muscle. The three lumbar nerves are easily found. They cross the crest of the ilium at a point corresponding to the outer limit of the attachment of the erector spinae to the innominate bone. Trace them down- wards as they ramify in the superficial fascia. A few twigs may be followed as far as the great trochanter. The cutaneous t^yigs which come from the anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves may be classified under three headings-(i.) Those which pass down- wards over the crest of the ilium. (2.) Those which pass backwards over the insertion of the gluteus maximus into the fascia lata. (3.) Those which turn upwards around the lower margin of the gluteus maximus. The nerves which cross the crest of the ilium areâ€” (i.) The iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve, and (2.) The iliac branch [i.e., the lateral cutaneous branch) of the last dorsal nerve. The latter lies a very short distance in front of the former, and is the larger of the two. They cross the iliac crest about two and a-half inches behind the anterior superior spine of the ilium. In the superficial fascia they spread out into a great number of fine twigs, some of which reach downwards as far as the level of the great trochanter. The nerves which pass backwards over the insertion of the gluteus maximus are a few small branches of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh. They are found above the level of the great trochanter. The cutaneous twigs which hook round the lower

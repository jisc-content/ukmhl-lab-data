71 POPLITEAL SPACE. of thsse vessels, but their close apposition to the femur should in all cases be sufficient to distinguish them. By separating widely the upper boundaries of the space the internal artery may be traced to the point where it passes under cover of the long tendon of the adductor magnus, and the external to the point where it pierces the external intermuscular septum of the leg. The Inferior Articular Arteries arise from the popliteal as it lies upon the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The external passes outwards in a trans- verse direction. The i?iternal takes an oblique course downwards and inwards along the upper margin of the popliteus muscle, and this is the best guide to the vessel. The Azygos Articular Artery springs from the popliteal as it reaches the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. It pierces this ligament to reach the synovial membrane. In carrying out the dissection of these arteries great care must be taken of the delicate articular nerves which accompany them. Obturator Nerve.—This minute nerve will be found lying upon the popliteal artery. Trace it upwards, and it will be seen to enter the space by piercing the lower fibres of the adductor magnus ; follow it downwards, and perhaps you may be able to see it entering the knee-joint by penetrating the posterior ligament. Floor of the Space.—This must now be cleaned. Scrape the fatty tissue from the popliteal surface of

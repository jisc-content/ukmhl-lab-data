237 PELVIC FASCIA. In carrying out the second or lower section, the dis- sector will meet with no difficulty whatever. The section of bone being successfully performed, the detached portion should be raised from the sub- jacent obturator internus. The fibres of this muscle take origin from the deep surface of the bone, and it will thus be necessary to use the knife in effecting the separation. Lastly, clean the obturator internus, and, grasping its tendon, draw it gently outwards and upwards, as in Fig. 40. The outer aspect of the parietal pelvic fascia comes into view. By this dis- section the student is afforded a striking illustration of the three morphological planes referred to on p. 226, as entering into the composition of the pelvic wall. Description of the Pelvic Fascia.â€”The dis- sector has already taken note of a continuous fascia lining the interior of the abdomen proper, and placed between the muscles on the one hand, and the extra- peritoneal fatty tissue and peritoneum on the other. In relative position the pelvic fascia is identical with the abdominal fascia, and the visceral layer of the former which passes inwards upon the upper surface of the pelvic diaphragm, may be compared with the thin cellular layer which clothes the under surface of the abdomino-thoracic diaphragm ; the one completes the aponeurotic wall of the great abdominal cavity below, whilst the other completes it above. But, whilst this is the case, it must be borne in mind that the abdo- minal and pelvic fascise are only directly continuous

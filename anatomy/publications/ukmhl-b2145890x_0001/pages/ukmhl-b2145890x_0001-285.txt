ABDOMINAL WALL. 6i corresponds in this respect with the external inter- costal muscles; the fibres proceed obliquely down- wards and forwards. Again, the internal oblique resembles the internal intercostal muscles in the direction of its fibres ; they are directed upwards and forwards, and thus the fibres of the two oblique muscles cross each other like the limbs of the letter X- Lastly, the fibres composing the trans- versalis muscle pursue a horizontal or transverse course. This difference of direction in the fibres which compose these three strata is a source of strength to the fleshy part of the abdominal wall, and offers an insurmountable barrier to the protrusion of any of the abdominal contents. The two oblique muscles and the transversalis are prolonged forward to the middle line in the form of aponeuroses. The union of these with the corresponding aponeuroses of the opposite side forms the linea alba—a strong liga- mentous band which extends in the median line from the symphysis pubis to the ensiform cartilage. Obliquus Externus. — Remove the superficial fascia from the front of the abdomen. This will expose the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Towards the thorax this aponeurosis is very thin, and is liable to injury unless the dissection be performed with care. Proceed cautiously also at the lower part of the abdomen, above the inner end of Poupart's ligament. Here the aponeurosis is pierced in the male by the spermatic cord. The lips of the

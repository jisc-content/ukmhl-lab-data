THE KIDNEYS. 191 the upper end of each kidney, or to injure the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles. The kidney is placed opposite the bodies of three and a-half vertebrae. It extends from the upper border of the last dorsal vertebra to the middle of the body of the third lumbar vertebra, and it lies obliquely â€”its upper end being somewhat nearer the mesial plane than its lower end. Its average length is four inches; its breadth two and a-half inches; and its average weight four and a-half ounces in the male, but somewhat less in the female. It is a solid organ, firm in consistence, and of a brownish- red colour. The/^7rM of this kidney is so characteristic that the term "reniform," or "kidney-shaped," has become very common in descriptive language. Th.^ anterior surface, full, rounded, and convex, looks forwards and outwards; whilst the posterior surface is flattened, and directed backwards and inwards. The extremities are round, but the superior end is thicker and more massive than the inferior, which is somewhat pointed. The external border, smooth and convex, is directed outwards and backwards ; whilst the internal border is concave, and looks forwards and inwards. The internal border presents a longitudinal fissure called the hilus, for the admission and egress of the vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and duct. This is bounded anteriorly and posteriorly by a thick lip, and leads into a deep recess in the kidney, which is called the sinus. Clean the ureter and vessels at the hilus. They will

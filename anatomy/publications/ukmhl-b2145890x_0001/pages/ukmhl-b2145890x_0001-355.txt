THE PERITONEUM. 131 meso-rectum, and the occasional meso-co^cum. The term ligament is given to folds which connect viscera which are not parts of the intestinal canal to the walls of the abdomen, or which bind viscera of any kind to the diaphragm. Examples of these are to be found in the ligaments of the liver, bladder, uterus, also in the phrenico-splenic ligament, the phrenico-colic liga- ment, and the gastro-phrenic ligament. Let us now endeavour to follow the peritoneal mem- brane in the vertical direction. The best point to start from is the great omentum, or the large fold which is spread out upon the surface of the small intestines. The great omentum is composed of four layers two anterior and two posterior layers, and these are con- tinuous with each other at the lower free margin of the fold. Trace the two anterior layers upwards. They lead us to the greater curvature of the stomach, and here they separate from each other so as to enclose this viscus between themâ€”one passing in front and the other behind it. The smooth glistening appear- ance presented by the surface of the stomach is due to the peritoneal coating which it thus acquires. At the lesser curvature of the stomach the two layers come together, and are prolonged upwards to the liver as a distinct fold, which receives the name of the gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. Reaching the transverse fissure of the liver, the two layers again separate, this time to enclose the liver. The one layer is directed forwards over the under surface of the organ, round its anterior border, and then backwards over its superior surface. On reaching the point where the

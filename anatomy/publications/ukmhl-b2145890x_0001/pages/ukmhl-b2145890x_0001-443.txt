SYMPATHETIC CORD. 21/ ligament, it is inserted into the small trochanter of the femur.* The Iliacus.—This muscle arises from the iliac fossa, the ilio-lumbar ligament, the base of the sacrum, and the capsule of the hip joint. It is inserted into the tendon of the psoas magnus—it going to be in- serted into the small trochanter. Some of its fibres, however, have a separate insertion into an impression below the small trochanter of the femur. Nerves on the Posterior Wall of the Abdomen. The nerves on the posterior wall of the abdomen are the gangliated cord of the sympathetic and the anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves, with the branches which proceed from them. These should now be dissected. Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic—This enters the abdomen behind the ligamentum arcuatum internum, and extends downwards upon the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae along the inner border of the psoas muscle. Above it is continuous with the thoracic portion of the cord, whilst below it passes behind the common iliac artery and enters the pelvis. In the thorax it is placed upon the heads of the ribs ; * Another muscle, called the psoas parviis, is occasionally present. This springs from the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae and the mtervertebral disc between them, and stretching downwards upon the anterior and inner aspect of the psoas magnus, it ends in a tendon which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and ilio- pectineal line.

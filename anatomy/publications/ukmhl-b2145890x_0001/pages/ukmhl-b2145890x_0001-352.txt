128 ABDOMEN. splenic flexure may rise so high as to occupy a position against the vault of the diaphragm, beside the fundus of the stomach. In such a case it intervenes between the stomach and the thora^cic wall, and would yield a tympanitic note upon pe.-oussion. The descending colon takes a vertical course down- wards through the left lumbar region, and, on gaining the left iliac region, becomes continuous with the sigmoid flexure. Its anterior surface and its sides are covered by peritoneum, but its posterior surface is bare, and rests upon the quadratus lumborum and the left kidney, to which it is connected by loose areolar tissue. It is into the lower part of this division of the colon that the surgeon opens in the operation of Colotomy. The opening is made into the posterior aspect of the tube so as to avoid wounding the peritoneum. It is therefore essential that the posterior rela- tions of the descending colon should be laid down with more than usual precision. Braune, by means of his sections of the frozen body, has rendered material help in this respect. At the level of the third lumbar vertebra, where the colon is in relation to the kidney, it lies along the outer border of the quadratus lumborum. Between the lower end of the kidney and the crest of the ilium (where the operation is performed) the quadratus lumborum is placed behind the colon, and must be divided, or pushed aside, in order to reach it. It may be noted that the outer edge of the erector spins usually corresponds with the bare posterior surface of the colon at this level. The sigmoid flexure is a double bending of the colon like the letter S. It Hes in the left iliac fossa, to which it is bound by a distinct sigmoid meso-colon. It is continuous above with the descending colon, whilst opposite the left sacro-iliac articulation it gives place to the rectum.

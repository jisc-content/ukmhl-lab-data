114 ABDOMEN. muscles, and the aponeuroses of the flat muscles of the abdomen. Laterally, it is bounded above by portions of the seven lower ribs, below by the iliac and ischial portions of the innominate bones, and between by the flat muscles of the abdomen. From this it will be seen that the roof, floor, and by far the greater part of the abdominal wall are com- posed of muscular structures, the contraction of which would diminish the capacity of the cavity, and subject the contained viscera to compression. Subdivision of the Abdominal Cavity.—In dealing with so large a cavity, and one which contains such a diversity of contents, it is absolutely necessary for anatomists to subdivide it into regions, in order that the precise position of each viscus may be accur- ately defined. In making the first subdivision we take advantage of the brim of the true pelvis. That part of the cavity which is situated above this is termed the abdomen proper; whilst that part which lies below it is called the pelvic cavity. A further subdivision is effected in the case of the abdomen proper by means of arbitrary lines. Two hori- zontal lines are drawn around the body, one at the level of the ninth costal cartilages, and the other at the level of the highest points of the iliac crests. The abdomen is thus mapped out into three zonular regions, which are termed from above downwards —(i.) the costal zone; (2.) the lumbar zone; and (3.) the iliac zone. Two vertical lines are now drawn, one upon each'side, from the costal cartilage of the eighth rib to

14 ABDOMEN. rectum and the muscles in connection with it, as well as the skin around the anus. They anastomose with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side, whilst some minute twigs ascend to effect anastomoses with branches of the middle and superior haemorrhoidal arteries. The inferior hcBinorrhoidal veins, when they become varicose, give rise to haemorrhoids. The inferior hcBmorrhoidal nerve accompanies the vessels. It may proceed directly from the sacral plexus, but more frequently it is a branch of the internal pudic nerve. Perforating the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, it enters the ischio-rectal fossa, and then it breaks up into muscular, cutaneous, and communicating branches. The muscular supply the external sphincter; the cutaneous offsets are given to the skin which surrounds the anus, whilst the communicating filaments pass forward to join the long pudendal nerve and the super- ficial perineal nerves. Perineal Branch of Fourth Sacral Nerve.— This small nerve enters the ischio-rectal fossa by piercing the coccygeus muscle at the side of the coccyx. It is distributed to the skin between the anus and coccyx, and to the external sphincter muscle. Urethral Triangle. The superficial fascia in this locality has already been studied. The following is a list of the structures which still require to be examined :— (i.) The superficial perineal vessels and nerves. (2.) The long pudendal nerve. (3.) The root of the penis } The bulb and the crura.

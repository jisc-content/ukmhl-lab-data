98 LOWER LIMB. has satisfied himself regarding its precise bony attach- ments. Divide it close to the round tendon of origin and throw it outwards. In doing this be careful of the anterior division of the obturator nerve, which lies under cover of it, and sends to it its nerve-supply. On approaching the linea aspera it will be found that its tendon is more or less fused with those of the adductor brevis and magnus. Separate them as far as possible, in order that we may obtain a good view of the pro- funda vessels. A little dissection will show the profunda artery and vein lying upon the adductors brevis and magnus, and separated from the femoral vessels by the interposition of the adductor longus. The perforating arteries will be seen to arise in series from the main trunk. The first of these arises at the lower margin of the pectineus, and pierces both the adductor brevis and adductor maenus. The second v^WX be found a little lower down, and it perforates the same muscles. Endeavour to find a small nutrient artery to the femur which springs from this branch. The third and the terminal twig of the artery pierce the adductor magnus alone. Pectineus and Internal Circumflex Artery.â€” The pectineus muscle must in the next place be reflected from its origin and thrown outwards. In separating the muscle from the pubis the dissector must remember that in some cases an accessory obturator nerve descends into the thigh over the brim of the pelvis and under cover of the pectineus. The internal circumflex branch of the profunda may

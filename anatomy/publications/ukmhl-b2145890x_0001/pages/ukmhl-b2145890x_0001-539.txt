FEMALE PELVIS. observed to be attached to the outer end of the ovary. The calibre of the Fallopian tube is by no means uni- form. It is often compared in this respect to a trum- pet. Thus it is narrow and cord-like towards the uterus, but, proceeding outwards, it becomes expanded and flexuous. Round Ligaments of the Uterus.—The round ligaments are two cord-like bands which are attached to the body of the uterus immediately, in front and a little below the entrance of the Fallopian tube—one on each side. From this each ligament is directed outwards and forwards between the layers of the broad ligament and in front of the oviduct, to the internal abdominal ring. It has already been examined within the inguinal canal. In the young subject the peri- toneum is usually prolonged along with it into this canal in the form of a tubular process termed the " Cajial of Nuckr Later on this becomes obliterated. Pelvic Blood-vessels. The manner in which the blood-vessels of the pelvis should be dissected is described at p. 257. In the female, however, three additional arteries will be found, yiz.— (i.) The uterine, ] , , <- , . (2.) The vaginal, / ^^^^^^^s of the internal iliac. (3.) The ovarian, from the abdominal aorta. The Uterine Artery springs from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and proceeds

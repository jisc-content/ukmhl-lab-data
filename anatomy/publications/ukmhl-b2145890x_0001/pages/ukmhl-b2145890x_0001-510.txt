ABDOMEN. 284 when, however, the enlargement is confined to one lobe or part of a lobe, it impinges upon the urethra, and produces an altera- tion in its direction, and a consequent difficulty in micturition. When the middle lobe alone is increased in size, it projects forwards into the bladder so as to close the commencement of the canal. The Membranous Portion of the Urethra.— This is the narrowest and the shoi^test division of the urethra. It extends from the apex of the prostate to the bulb of the penis, and describes a gentle curve from above, downwards and forwards, behind the lower border of the symphysis pubis, from which it is distant about one inch. Its length is fully three quarters of an inch, and its concavity is directed forwards and upwards, and its convexity backwards and downwards. Throughout its entire extent it is enveloped by the fibres of the compressor urethrae muscle, whilst towards its termination Cowper's glands are placed behind it—one on each side. The relation of the membranous part of the urethra to the triangular ligament and the parietal pelvic fascia is very important. As it emerges from the prostate, the parietal pelvic fascia the posterior layer of the triangular ligament) sweeps backwards upon it to take part in the formation of the prostatic capsule. At its termination it pierces the triangular ligament about an inch below the symphysis pubis. It may therefore be looked upon as lying in the interval between these membranes. The Spongy Portion of the Urethra.—This is the longest division of the urethra. It is embedded

ABDOMEN. i88 right and left hepatic ducts issue from the extremities of the transverse fissure, and unite to form the hepatic duct. To see these points, it will be necessary to remove a sheath of areolar tissue which surrounds the hepatic ducts and vessels, and which is termed Glisson's capsule. If the dissector now investigates the composition of the wall of the gall-bladder, he will find that, in addition to its partial serous covering, it has—(i.) a strong coat composed of muscular and white fibrous tissue, and (2.) an internal mucous coat. The first can be seen by stripping off the peritoneum, and the second is best displayed by laying open the gall- bladder with a pair of scissors. The mucous mem- brane will then be seen to be elevated into ridges which join with each other so as to form an alveolar arrangement—the meshes or depressions having a polygonal form. The cystic duct should also be laid open, when the mucous membrane in this will be ob- served to be raised into oblique crescentic folds, which, when viewed collectively, have a spiral appearance. The Vessels of the Liver.—Blood enters the liver—(i.) by the hepatic artery, (2.) by the large portal vein; whilst it is led away from the liver by the hepatic veins. The hepatic artery \s a branch of the cceliac axis, and carries arterial blood for the nourishment of the liver substance. The portal vein carries venous blood, which it has gathered from the entire length of the abdominal portion of the alimentary canal (with the

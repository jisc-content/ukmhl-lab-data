59 ABDOMINAL WALL. It differs from the other members of the series in not dividing into an anterior and posterior branch, and in being destined for the supply of the integument over the gluteal region. It pierces the external oblique muscle in a line with the other lateral nerves, and is then directed downwards over the crest of the ilium. It crosses the iliac crest about two inches behind the anterior superior spine, at a point corresponding to the posterior border of the tensor fasciae femoris. The iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve is also distributed to the skin of the gluteal region. It pierces the external oblique immediately above the iliac crest, which it crosses a little behind its middle point, and posterior to the iliac branch of the last dorsal nerve. Cutaneous Vessels.—Cutaneous arteries are found accompanying the cutaneous nerves. Those which are associated with the lateral cutaneous nerves are branches of the aortic intercostal arteries, whilst those in relation to the anterior cutaneous nerves are derived from the deep and superior epigastric arteries. ' '" ' '' In addition to these, th^ee named branches of the femoral artery ramify in the superficial fascia of the groin. These are— (i.) The superficial pudic. (2.) The superficial epigastric. (3.) The superficial circumflex iliac. They take origin in the thigh a short distance below

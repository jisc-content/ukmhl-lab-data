134 LOWER LIMB. forwards on the toes it is necessary to examine the sheaths which retain them upon the plantar aspect of the phalanges. Open these sheaths by making a longitudinal incision through each. This will reveal the synovial membrane which lines them and also the tendons which they enclose. Two tendons go to each of the four outer toes. The mode of insertion of these tendons and the manner in which the superficial ten- don is pierced by the deep tendon should be studied. In the case of the hallux only one tendon is found inside the flexor sheath—viz., the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. Third Layer of Muscles—To bring the third layer of muscles into view we require to make the following dissection -.—Divide the two heads of the accessorius and draw the muscle forwards from under the external plantar vessels and nerve. Sever also the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and the flexor longus hallucis at the point where they emerge from under cover of the internal annular ligament. Upon cutting the branch which is given by the external plantar nerve to the accessorius these structures can be thrown forwards towards the toes. On raising the lumbrical muscles the twigs which are furnished to the third ^-^^ fourth by the deep division of the external plantar nerve must be looked for. Lastly, cut the internal plantar nerve close to its origin and turn it aside. ' T\v& flexor brevis hallucis lies along the outer side of the abductor hallucis. It arises by a single head of origin, but soon divides into two fleshy parts, which are

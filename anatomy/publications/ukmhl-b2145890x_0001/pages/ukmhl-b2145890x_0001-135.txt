POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 123 into the substance of the flexor longus hallucis at this point, and it is well to study the muscle first. The branches of the posterior tibial nerve should now be examined. They supply the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus hallucis, and the flexor longus digitorum. One or two delicate filaments descend upon the posterior tibial artery, and may be followed to the skin, and the plantar cutaneous or internal calcanear has already been seen piercing the internal annular ligament on the inner aspect of the heel. Deep Muscles.â€”The popliteus muscle will be seen lying upon the posterior aspect of the knee-joint and upon the posterior surface of the tibia above the oblique line. Its tendon of origin lies within the capsule of the knee-joint, and its examination should be deferred until the ligaments of this articulation are dissected. Note the strong fascia which covers the posterior surface of the muscle and trace it upwards and inwards to the inner side of the knee. Here it will be observed to be continuous with the tendon of the semimembranosus, and through it therefore the semimembranosus may be regarded as having an insertion into the oblique line of the tibia. The flexor longus hallucis is placed upon the posterior aspect of the fibula, and its tendon will be noticed to groove deeply the posterior border of the astragalus as it passes forwards to gain the sole of the foot. The flexor longus digitorum lies upon the tibia, and the tibialis posticus rests upon the interosseous mem- brane between the fleshy bellies of the two flexors.

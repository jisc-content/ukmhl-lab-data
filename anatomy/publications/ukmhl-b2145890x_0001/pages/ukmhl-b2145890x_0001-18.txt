6 UPPER LIMB. and also a varying amount of the chest wall—a portion corresponding to the sixth intercostal space. On the second day the dissector should begin by reflecting the trapezius muscle. Reflection of Trapezius.—This should be done, if possible, in conjunction with the dissector of the head and neck. Divide the muscle about half-an-inch from the spines of the vertebrae, and throw it outwards towards its insertion. In doing this, care must be taken not to injure the subjacent rhomboid muscles. The trapezius is very thin at its origin, and the rhom- boids will not escape if the dissector be incautious, A small bursa between the tendon of insertion of the lower part of the trapezius and the root of the scapular spine must not be overlooked. A dissection of the deep surface of the reflected muscle will reveal the following structures :— (rt.) Spinal accessory nerve. (/^.) Some nerves from the cervical plexus, (r.) The superficial cervical artery. These collectively constitute the nervous and vascular supply of the muscle. The branches of the spinal accessory nerve and twigs from the third and fourth cervical nerves spread out upon the deep surface of the muscle, and join with each other so as to form a subtrapezial plexus. The terminal filaments of the former may, with care, be traced nearly to the lower border of the trapezius. The superficial cervical artery must be followed upwards to the anterior border of the muscle, and

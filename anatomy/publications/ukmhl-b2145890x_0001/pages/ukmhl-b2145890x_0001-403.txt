SOLAR PLEXUS. " 17/ derived from the semi-lunar ganglion, but many come from the cceliac plexus. Below, it is directly- continuous with the renal plexus, and above it is connected with the diaphragmatic plexus. The smallest splanchnic nerve usually contributes branches to this plexus, and the point at which they join is marked by a small ganglion. Diaphragmatic Plexus.—The filaments composing this plexus take origin from the upper part of the semi-lunar ganglion, and are distributed with the phrenic artery to the under surface of the diaphragm, but they do not follow rigorously the branches of this vessel. At first they lie subjacent to the peritoneum, but soon they penetrate between the fleshy fibres and establish communications with the phrenic nerve. On the right side a small ganglion is formed on the under surface of the diaphragm at the point of junction be- tween this plexus and the phrenic. In addition to its diaphragmatic branches, it contributes filaments to the suprarenal plexus, and on the right side to the hepatic plexus. Apply two ligatures to the oesophagus, where it enters the stomach, and divide it between them. The stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and spleen may now be removed by dividing the vessels, nerves, and peri- toneal folds which still hold them in position. The Spleen.—A very limited idea of the internal structure of this organ can be obtained in the dissect- ing-rooms. It is'enveloped by two coats—(i.) serous ; (2.) fibro-elastic. The peritoneal investment adheres so PART II.

ABDOMEN. The inferior surface is somewhat concave, and rendered highly irregular, from the presence of fissures and lobes. No less than five fissures are to be seen, viz.:— . . { fissure for umbilical vem. (I.) The longitudmal | ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^3^ (2.) The transverse. (3.) The fissure or fossa for the gall-bladder. (4.) The fissure or fossa for the vena cava. The longitudinal fissure traverses the under surface of the liver, from the anterior to the posterior border, along a line which corresponds with the line of attach- ment of the falciform ligament on the superior surface. It, therefore, is the indication on this aspect of the organ of a subdivision into a right and left lobe. The anterior part of this fissure receives the special name of the umbilical fissure because it holds the ligamentum teres, or the remains of the umbilical vein, whilst the posterior part of the longitudinal fissure is called the ■fissure for the ductus venosus, on account of its being occupied by the fibrous cord, which in the adult represents this vessel. The umbilical fissure is fre- quently bridged over by liver substance, and this link between the right and left lobes is termed the pons hepatis^ The transverse fissure is the deep depression or hilus at which the portal vein and the hepatic artery, * The umbilical vein is the vessel which, during the intra-uterine Hfe of the foetus, returns the purified blood from the placenta. It enters the abdominal cavity at the umbilicus, and ascends to the longitudmal fissure on the under surface of the liver, along the free margin of the falciform ligament. After giving some branches to the right and lett lobes of this organ, it ends by dividing into two branches; of these,

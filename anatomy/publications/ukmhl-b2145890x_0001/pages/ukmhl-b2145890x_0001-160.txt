Note how the internal mammary lies between the costal cartilages and the pleura in the first part of its course, and between the cartilages and triangularis sterni in the lower and greater part of its course. Note further that it is crossed by the intercostal nerves before they turn forwards to gain the surface. perforating arteries ^XiA ^C^^ anterior intercostal arteries of the upper seven spaces are now seen to spring from the internal mammary.

PELVIC ARTICULATIONS. 291 extends downwards from the front of the sacrum to the anterior aspect of the coccyx, and by a posterior liga- ment which, attached above to the border of the lower aperture of the sacral canal, proceeds downwards upon the posterior aspect of the coccyx. The latter liga- ment is much the stronger of the two. In addition, fibrous bands will also be found passing between the cornu^ of the sacrum and the coccyx. As regards the coccygeal joints (when such exist), the union of the different segments of the bone is' effected in the same manner as in the case of the sacrum and coccyx. The student should now saw through the sacrum and coccyx in the mesial plane. By this proceeding he will obtain a view of the structure of the intervertebral discs, and at the same time be enabled to make out to better advantage the attachments of the posterior common vertebral ligament and of the ligamenta subflava. Sacro-iliac Articulation.-The sacrum is wedged m between the two innominate bones, and is held fast in this position by the form of the articular sur- faces and the ligaments which pass between the bones. These ligaments areâ€” (i.) The anterior sacro-iliac. (2.) The posterior sacro-iliac. (3-) The oblique sacro-iliac. (4-) Great sacro-sciatic. (5.) Small sacro-sciatic.

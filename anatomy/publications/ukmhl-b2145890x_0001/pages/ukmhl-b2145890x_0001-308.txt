84 ABDOMEN. observe minute fatty masses protruding. A little below its middle is the umbilicus, but the foramen, of which this is the remains, is now completely closed; indeed, in the adult the linea alba is stronger at this point than elsewhere. Fascia Transversalis.â€”This is a thin layer of fascia which is spread out upon the deep surface of the transversalis muscle. The fascia of one side is directly continuous with the fascia of the opposite side, and it forms a part of an extensive fascial stratum, which lines the entire abdominal wall, and is placed between the abdominal muscles and their aponeuroses on the one hand, and the extra-peritoneal fatty tissue on the other. Traced upwards, the fascia transversalis becomes thin and cellular, and at the margin of the thorax it is directly continuous with the fascia which lines the lower surface of the diaphragm. Towards the inguinal region it plays a most important part as a constituent of the abdominal wall. Here, then, it must be studied with great care. In the present state of the dissection (on the right side of the body), a gap or interval is seen to exist be- tween the lower arched border of the transversalis muscle and Poupart's ligament. The membrane which fills up this interval is the transversalis fascia. At no part of the abdominal wall is the fascia stronger than here, and this accession of strength is obviously for the purpose of compensating for the deficiency in the internal oblique and trans-

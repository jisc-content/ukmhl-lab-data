ABDOMEN. 206 The single branches have already been described with the exception of the middle sacral, which arises from the extremity of the aorta between the two common iliacs. It will be studied in connection with the pelvis. The paired branches may now be ex- amined. The Inferior Phrenic Arteries have already been noticed upon the under surface of the diaphragm. They are two in number, and are the first branches of the abdominal aorta. Diverging from each other, the artery of the right side passes behind the vena cava, whilst the artery of the left side goes behind the oesophagus. At the posterior border of the central tendon of the diaphragm, each divides into an external and internal branch. The external branch proceeds outwards to anastomose with the intercostal arteries, whilst the internal branch curves forwards in front of the central tendon, and ends by anastomosing with its fellow, and with the internal mammary artery. Each phrenic artery, in addition to the branches which it supplies to the diaphragm, gives a twig, called the superior capsular artery, to the suprarenal body. On the left side it also sends a few minute branches to the oesophagus. The phrenic veins open into the vena cava. The Middle Capsular Arteries are two small vessels which arise one from each side of the aorta at the same level as the superior mesenteric. They run outwards and upwards in front of the crura of the diaphragm to the suprarenal bodies, into the substance

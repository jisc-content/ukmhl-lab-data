TRACHEA AND BRONCHI. 183 ciated with the right coronary artery; {b) some supply the left auricle; (c) a few pass forwards to join the superficial cardiac plexus ; {d.) some'are continued into the left anterior pulmonary plexus. Removal of the Heart from the Body.â€”To do this it is only necessary to divide the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins. The other vessels have been already severed. The ascending portion of the aortic arch which is attached to the heart should next be slit open, care being taken to carry the knife between two of the segments of the valve, so as not to injure either. The semilunar valve can now be studied, and the dissector will observe that two of the segments are placed anteriorly and one posteriorly in relation to the aortic orifice. On looking into the sinuses of Val- salva, which correspond to the two anterior segments, the mouths of the coronary arteries will be seen. The last step in the dissection of the heart consists in the removal of the auricles. In effecting this, the student should observe that the muscular fibres of the auricles are not continuous with those of the ventricles. The relative positions of the ventricular openings can now be seen. The auriculo-ventricular openings lie posteriorly and side by side ; the aortic opening lies in front and between them; whilst the pulmonary orifice is placed in front of the aortic opening. Trachea and Bronchi.-Thc thoracic portion of the trachea lies in the middle line of the body in the superior mediastinal space. To expose it more fully separate the two pulmonary arteries with the knife,

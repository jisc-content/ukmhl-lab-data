Observe how the density of the membrane diminishes almost imme- diately below the subclavius, and this so abruptly that a crescentic margin is formed. Its lower connections Fig. 2.

In a good subject, however, it will be seen to join the sheath of the axillary vessels, and also to give a process of fascia to the sheath of the pectoralis minor. Four structures pierce the costo-coracoid membrane and these must be noted. They are: (i.) The thoracic axis arteryâ€”breaking up into (a) pectoral thoracic, {b) clavicular thoracic, (c) acromial thoracic, {d) humeral thoracic branches ; (2.) The thoracic axis vein; (3.) The cephalic vein; and lastly (4.) The external anterior thoracic nerve. Now remove the costo-coracoid membrane. The

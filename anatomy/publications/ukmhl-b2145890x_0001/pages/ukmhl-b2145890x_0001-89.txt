77 FRONT OF THE THIGH. The quadrilateral flap of skin thus traced out must be raised very carefully from the subjacent superficial fascia, and turned outwards. Superficial Fascia.—It is usual for anatomists to complicate the description of this fascia by stating- that it consists of two layers. We do not consider it necessary to make this subdivision. We look upon the superficial fascia in this region as being: essentially the same as in all other localities of the body. We look upon it as being composed of one stratum of fatty areolar tissue—a stratum, however, which an expert dissector will have little difficulty in splitting up into two or more artificial layers. The superficial fascia is firmly attached by its deep surface to the fascia lata below Poupart's ligament.* To demonstrate this attachment satisfactorily, it is necessary that the dissectors of the lower limb and abdomen should work in conjunction with each other. Supposing the skin to be reflected from the surface of the abdomen, a transverse incision should be made through the superficial fascia from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the middle line of the body. On raising the lower edge of the divided fascia, the hand can be easily insinuated between it and the pearly-looking tendon of the external oblique, and it can be carried downwards under the fascia as * According to Dr. Russell, who has made many special dissections of this fascia, the superficial fascia is attached to the deep fascia horizontally across the thigh. Internally it is attached to the inner half of Poupart's ligament, but the line of attachment falls below the outer half of the ligament which curves upwards.

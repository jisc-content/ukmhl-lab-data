91 FRONT OF THE THIGH. Anterior Orural Nerve.—The branches of this 11 nerve should first engage the attention of the dissector. : It will be noticed that they resolve themselves into a i cutaneous and muscular series. The cutaneous branches i are {a) the middle cutaneous, (J?) the internal cutaneous, i and ic) the long saphenous. Be careful of the minute twigs I of supply which enter the sartorius from the first two of 1 these nerves. Trace the internal cutaneous downwards 1 to the point at which it splits into its anterior and inner I divisions. The latter will be noticed to run along the inner margin of the sartorius, and especial care must be exercised in its dissection, because by tracing out its various branches a delicate plexus may be made out, in the formation of which filaments from the long saphenous and obturator nerves also take part. The long sapJienous runs along the outer side of the femoral artery. The muscular branches of the anterior crural are distributed to the extensor muscles, and they must be traced into the muscles which they supply. The small twig to the pectineus has already been noted. I It usually springs from the anterior crural at a point corresponding to the origin of the profunda femoris i artery. The nerves to the vastus externus and internus have a special interest, inasmuch as each sends a 1 delicate filament to the knee-joint. These twigs i descend amidst the muscular fibres, and each is I associated with an artery—the internal with the arti- cular branch of the anastomotic artery, and the external i with the descending branch of the external circumflex artery.

In dissecting these structures care must be taken of the internal cutaneoiLs branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. , Axillary Vessels.—It is the third part of the axil- lary artery that is now exposed. Observe that this is not covered by any muscular structure in its lower part. It will be seen that this is due to the posterior wall of the axilla extending further downwards than the anterior wall. The axillary vein lies to inner side of artery. Three branches are given off by this portion of the artery, but only two of them can be examined in the present stage of the dissection—viz., the subscapular and the posterior circumflex arteries. The anterior circumflex will be studied when the pectoralis major is reflected. Axillary Nerves.—These lie grouped around the artery. To its outer side is the musculo-cutaiteous, which soon leaves it, however, to pierce the sub- stance of the coraco-brachialis muscle. Embracing the artery are the two heads of the median nerve, which at first lies upon and then to the outer side of the vessel. To its inner side are the ulnar, internal cutaneous, and lesser internal cutaneous nerves. The last of these we have already seen effecting a com- munication with the intercosto-humeral nerve. Behind the axillary artery are the circumflex nerve and the large musculo-spii'al nerve. The latter whilst still within the axilla gives off its internal cutaneous nerve, and this must not be overlooked in the dissection. In the last place, the middle subscapular nerve must be

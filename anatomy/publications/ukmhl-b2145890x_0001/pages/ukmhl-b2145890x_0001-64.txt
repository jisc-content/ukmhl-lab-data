INFERIOR EXTREMITY, « LOWERLIMB. On the morning of the second day, after the subject is brought into the Rooms, it is placed upon the table with its face downwaids and its chest and pelvis sup- ported with blocks. (PL III. p. 2). In this position it is allowed to remain for four days, and in this time the dissector of the lower limb has a very extensive dissection to perform. He has to dissect—(i.) The gluteal region ; (2.) The popliteal space ; and (3.) The back of the thigh. With so much work before him, and being limited as to the time in which it must be done, it is very necessary that he should apportion the four days at his disposal so as to be ready for the turning of the body. The first two days he should devote exclusively to the study of the gluteal region ; the third day may be given to the popliteal space; and on the fourth day he should undertake the dis- section of the back of the thigh, and revise the work of the three preceding days.

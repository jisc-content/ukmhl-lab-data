PELVIC ARTICULATIONS. 293 by its apex it is attached to the spine of the ischium.* ^ The ligaments of the sacro-iliac joint should now be divided, and the two bones forcibly wrenched asunder. By this proceeding each articular surface will be seen to be covered with a plate of cartilage, between which a small space lined by synovial membrane may be observed, which partially separates them.f Symphysis Pubis.-This is an example of an am- phiarthrodial joint In addition to the intervening disc of fibro-cartilage which connects the cartilage-covered _ * The two sacro-sciatic ligaments convert the sciatic notches of the innommate bone into foramina. The following are the structures which pass through these :— Great sacro-sciatic foramen. (r.) Gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. (2.) Pyriformis muscle. (3-) Sciatic and pudic vessels.

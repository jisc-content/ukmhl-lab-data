In almost every case a hernial protrusion in passing to the sur- face carries before it a portion of the parietal peritoneum, which constitutes its immediate covering, and is termed by surgeons the sac of the hernia. In oblique inguinal hernia the other cover- ings which the protrusion acquires are identical with those of the spermatic cord. Entering the internal abdominal ring, it receives an investment from the infundibuliform fascia; emerg- ing from the lower border of the internal oblique, it acquires a cremasteric covering; and, coming out through the external Fig. 15.

From the surface, then, to the peritoneal sac, the follow- ing are the coverings of an oblique inguinal hernia :— (l.) Skin and superficial fascia. (2.) Intercolumnar or external spermatic fascia. (3-) Crem'asteric fascia. (4-) Infundibuliform fascia. (5.) Extra-peritoneal fatty tissue. (6.) Parietal peritoneum, constituting the hernial sac.

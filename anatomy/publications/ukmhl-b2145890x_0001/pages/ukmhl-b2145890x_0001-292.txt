ABDOMEN. 68 may be considered as its attachment proper; (2.) through the medium of Gimbernat's Hgament to the ilio-pectineal line. Poupart's hgament does not pursue a straight course between its ihac and pubic attachments. It describes a curve, the convexity of which is directed downwards and outwards towards the thigh. By its lower border it yields attachment to the fascia lata. When this is divided it at once loses its curved direction. Gimbernafs ligament is a triangular process of aponeurotic fascia. Raise the spermatic cord, and place the finger behind the inner end of Poupart's ligament, and press downwards. The structure upon which the finger rests is the ligament in question, and the student should note that at this point it offers a barrier to the passage of the finger into the thigh. With the handle of the knife its shape and connections can be easily defined. Its apex is fixed to the pubic spine; by one margin it is attached to the inner end of Poupart's ligament; by its other margin it is in- serted for the distance of an inch into the ilio-pectineal line. Its base is sharp, crescentic, and free, and is directed outwards towards the femoral sheath. Gim- bernat's ligament occupies an oblique plane, its lower femoral surface looking downwards and slightly for- wards and outwards, whilst its upper abdominal sur- face looks upwards and slightly backwards and inwards. It is of importance that the student should note the precise relation which this ligament bears to the spermatic cord. Taken in conjunction with Poupart's ligament and the aponeurosis of the ex-

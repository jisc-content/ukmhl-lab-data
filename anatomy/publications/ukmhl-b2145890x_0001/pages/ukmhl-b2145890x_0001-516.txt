290 ABDOMEN. ment of the dorsal region. It is triangular in shape, and is fixed by its apex to the tip of the transverse process of the l^st lumbar vertebra. Proceeding hori- zontally outwards, it is inserted into the inner lip of the iliac crest at the posterior part of the iliac fossa. The dissector has already noticed that the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia is attached to the upper border of this ligament, and further, that it affords a surface of origin by its posterior aspect for the quad- ratus lumborum, and by its anterior surface for the iliacus muscle. The amphiarthrodial joint, between the body of the last lumbar vertebra and the base of the sacrum, corre- sponds in every respect with the similar articulations above, between the bodies of the vertebrae. The opposed bony surfaces are each coated by a thin layer of cartilage, and are firmly united by an inter- vening disc of fibro-cartilage, which is dense and laminated externally, soft and pulpy towards the centre, where, indeed, a synovial cavity may in some instances be found. The dissector should observe, however, that this disc is the thickest of the series, and further, that it is thicker in front than behind. Sacro-coccygeal Articulation.â€”This is an am- phiarthrodial joint. The articulating surfaces are each covered by a thin cartilaginous plate, and these are united by a disc of fibro-cartilage. The joint is strengthened in front by an anterior ligament, which

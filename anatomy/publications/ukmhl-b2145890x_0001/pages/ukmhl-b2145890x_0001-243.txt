MALE PERINEUM. 19 shows a slight dilatation or bulging; from this to its I posterior extremity it gradually tapers away. The ^ corpus spongiosum is continued backwards in the middle line of the body to within a short distance of the anus, and it gradually expands so as to form a bulbous posterior extremity. The corpus spongiosum, as it * lies in the interval between the diverging crura, is therefore termed the bulb of the penis. The bulb rests upon the superficial aspect of the triangular ligament, and it is firmly bound down to this by an aponeurotic investment, which is prolonged over it from the ligament. The bulb and the two crura together constitute the 7'oot of the penis, diXid each is provided with a special muscle, which at present hides it from view. Clothing the bulb the student will recognise a bipenniform muscle called the accelerator urincz, whilst moulded upon the surface of each crus is the e7'ector penis muscle. These muscles should now be cleaned and their con- nections examined. Superficial Perineal Muscles.â€”Under this head- ing are included not only the accelerator urinae and erector penis muscles, but also the transversus perinei. The superficial perineal muscles have been seen to lie within the-pouch formed by the superficial fascia and the triangular ligament. When the superficial fascia is removed each will be found to be invested by its own delicate aponeurotic layer. The transversus perinei muscle is a narrow slip of muscular fibres which arises from the inner aspect of

ABDOMINAL CAVITY. the obliterated umbilical vein, will be observed extend- ing from the umbilicus to the under surface of the liver. The obliterated umbilical vein also receives the name of the round ligament, or ligamentum teres, of the liver. As it ascends towards that organ, it gradually recedes from the posterior surface of the abdominal wall, taking with it a fold of peritoneum, termed the falciform ligament of the liver. Shape and Boundaries of the Abdominal Cavity.â€”The abdominal cavity is ovoid in shape, its vertical diameter being the longest. Superiorly, it is roofed by the dome-shaped diaphragm, which presents a deep concavity towards the abdomen. Inferiorly, it is floored by the pelvic diaphragm, which is formed by the levatores ani and the coccygei muscles, and which is also concave towards the abdominal cavity. Neither the roof nor the floor are complete and unbroken. The diaphragm is perforated by certain structures which pass between the thorax and the abdomen. The continuity of the pelvic diaphragm is broken by the passage of certain structures between the pelvic division of the abdominal cavity and the perineum. Posteriorly, the cavity of the abdomen is bounded by the lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum, and on each side of the spine by the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. Anteriorly, it is bounded above by the ensiform car- tilage and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, below by the pubic bones and the symphysis pubis, and be- tween by the linea alba, the recti and pyramidales PART II.

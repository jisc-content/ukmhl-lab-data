27 MALE PERINEUM. bladder to its termination on the glans penis. These areâ€”(i.) the prostatic portion; (2.) the membranous or muscular portion ; and (3.) the spongy portion. Each of these subdivisions has a very definite relation to the triangular ligament; the prostatic part is placed be- hind this ligament; the membranous part is situated between the two layers of the ligament, whilst the spongy portion lies in front of the ligament. Now that the anterior layer of the triangular liga- ment is removed upon one side, the student can readily feel with the point of the finger the staff as it lies within the membranous portion of the urethra. He should examine also its surroundings. It is the short- est subdivision of the urethra, and is distant one inch from the symphysis pubis. Throughout its entire extent it is enveloped by the fibres of the compressor urethrae, and on this account it is sometimes called the muscular part of the urethra. On each side, and at a lower level, are Cowper's glands, whilst midway between it and the symphysis pubis is the dorsal vein of the penis as it extends backwards between the two layers of the triangular ligament. The Compressor or Constrictor Urethrae is a fan-shaped muscle. It has a narrow tendinous origin from the pubic arch close to the junction of the pubic and ischial rami. Expanding as it passes inwards to- wards the urethra, its fibres arrange themselves into two layers, which enclose between them the entire extent of the membranous portion of the urethra. The muscles of opposite sides meet therefore in the

3 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. the cutaneous vessels and nerves in the dorsal and lumbar regions. These are embedded in the substance of the superficial fascia. In searching for a cutaneous nerve cut boldly down through the superficial fascia, in the direction in which the nerve runs, until you come to the plane at which the superficial and deep fasciae blend. It is here that the main trunks are to be found, and in a well- injected subject the cutaneous vessels constitute the best guides. A more rapid way of finding the cutaneous nerves in this region is to reflect both fascise outwards from the vertebral spines. The nerves are seen piercing the muscles. This plan, however, should only be adopted by the senior student. The upper six dorsal cutaneous nei-ves spring from the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves. They become superficial close to the vertebral spines, and are to be sought for close to the middle line. The lozver six dorsal cutaneous nerves and the tJiree lumbar cutaneous nerves proceed from the external branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves, and conse- quently they must be looked for at a short distance from the middle line of the back. They become superficial on a line with the angles of the ribs and the outer margin of the erector spinse muscle. Trapezius Muscle.—The trapezius should now be ■cleaned. This muscle belongs only in part to the dissector of the arm. That portion of it which lies

56 ABDOMEN. been examined. On the anterior aspect of the thigh it has a linear attachment by its deep surface to the fascia lata. This attachment can be readily demon- strated, but, seeing that the dissection required en- croaches somewhat upon the region of the thigh, it must be done in conjunction with the dissector, of the lower limb. Divide the fascia horizontally from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the middle line of the body. Raising the lower cut edge of the fascia from the subjacent pearly tendon of the ex- ternal oblique, insinuate the fingers between them. The hand can now be pushed downwards, behind the superficial fascia,* without meeting any resistance until we reach the neighbourhood of Poupart's liga- ment. Here a very decided obstacle is opposed to the further progress of the hand—viz., the attachment of the fascia by its deep surface to the fascia lata. A little manipulation will show that this attachment stretches almost horizontally across the front of the thigh; that internally it coincides with Poupart's ligament, but that externally it falls below the Hne of this ligament. Towards the pubes the finger can be pushed down- wards behind the superficial fascia and along the spermatic cord into the perineum. No barrier opposes the passage of the finger in this direction. If the dissector now recall the fact that in the * As the superficial fascia is thus raised from the aponeurosis of the external oblique, the hypogastric branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve will be seen piercing the aponeurosis, a little way above the external ■ abdominal ring, and then sinking into the deep surface of the superficial fascia.

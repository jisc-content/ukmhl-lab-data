294 ABDOMEN. opposing surfaces of the two pubic bones, four liga- ments are present, viz.:— (i.) Anterior pubic. (2.) Posterior pubic. (3.) Supra-pubic. (4.) Infra or sub-pubic. The anterior pubic ligament is strongly marked, and consists of two layers of fibres—a superficial and a deep. The superficial fibres are oblique, and cross each other like the limbs of the letter X, mingling with the decussating fibres of the internal pillars of the external abdominal ring. The deep fibres are transverse, and extend across from one bone to the other. The posterior pubic ligament consists of a very few fibres on the posterior aspect of the joint. The supra-pubic ligament, like the preceding, is weak. It is placed upon the upper aspect of the symphysis, and stretches between the crests of the two pubic bones. The infra or sub-pubic ligament, which is situated on the lower aspect of the joint, rounds off the apex of the pubic arch. It is a strong band, somewhat tri- angular in shape, which is attached on each side to the descending ramus of the pubic bone, and above, to the fibro-cartilaginous disc. Inferiorly it gives attach- ment to the triangular ligament of the urethra. The saw should now be used, and a portion sliced off from the front of the joint. The intervening plate of fibro-cartilage can in this way be studied. It will be seen to be thicker and denser in front than behind. As a general rule, a small synovial cavity will be found towards its back part, and nearer its upper than its lower end.

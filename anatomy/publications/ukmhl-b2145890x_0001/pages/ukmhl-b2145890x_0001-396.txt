ABDOMEN. the pancreas. For convenience in description, the duodenum is divided into an ascendiyig or first part, a descending ox second part, and a transverse or third part. The ascending part of the duodenum begins in the epigastric region at the pyloric end of the stomach, and extends from this upwards, backwards, and to the right, into the right hypochondrium. It ends at the neck of the gall-bladder by bending downwards. This portion is completely enveloped by peritoneum, being enclosed like the stomach between the two anterior layers of the great omentum. It is therefore freely moveable. Its relations are—above and in front, the under surface of the liver and the gall bladder; behind, the vena portae, the gastro-duodenal artery, and the bile duct. It is usually found deeply stained from transudation of bile from the gall-bladder. The descending part extends vertically downwards from the right hypochondrium into the right lumbar region as far as the level of the third lumbar vertebra, at which point it ends by turning to the left. It is fixed in position, the peritoneum covering its anterior surface only. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct open into the inner aspect of this portion of the duodenum a little below its middle, and this shows the necessity of its being fixed and immoveable. Its relations are—in front, the colon; behind, the right kidney, to which it is connected by areolar tissue; to the left, the head of the pancreas. The transverse part begins on the right side of the third lumbar vertebra, and extends upwards and to the left, across the spine and through the umbilical region.

PELVIC NERVES. 271 It accompanies the pudic nerve through the great sacro-sciatic foramen into the gluteal region, where it gives a twig to the superior gemellus. It reaches the obturator internus by passing through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, and ends by sinking into the inner aspect of this muscle. The nerve to the quadratus femoris arises from the lower part of the plexus, and enters the gluteal region by passing through the lower part of the great sacro- sciatic foramen. It also supplies the gemellus inferior and a branch to the hip-joint. Sacro-Ooccygeal Plexus.—Thefourth sacral nerve, as we have seen, sends upwards a branch to join the sac- ral plexus; it also sends a twig downwards to unite with the fifth sacral nerve. But in addition to these connect- ing branches, it gives off muscular and visceral branches. The muscular branches are distributed to three muscles—viz., the levator ani, the coccygeus, and the sphincter ani externus. The last of these has already been dissected in the perineum, under the name of the "perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve." ^ The visceral branches are very numerous, and are directed inwards towards the viscera. Here they join with the pelvic plexus of nerves. Some, however, may be found entering the viscera directly. Very frequently the third sacral nerve also gives off visceral branches. The fifth sacral nerve pierces the coccygeus and appears in the pelvis. After being joined by the branch from the fourth sacral nerve, it turns down-

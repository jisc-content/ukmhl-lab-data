TIBIAL REGION. turned aside from its origin in order that the nerve may be followed out. It will be found to give off a small recurrent articular nerve to the knee-joint, and then to divide into the anterior tibial and musculo- cutaneous nerves. The recurrent branch accompanies the recurrent tibial artery. The anterior tibial pierces the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum to reach the front of the leg. The miLsculo-cutaneous should be traced downwards in the substance of the peroneus longus. It then reaches the interval between the two peronei muscles, which it supplies, and lastly it comes to lie between the peroneus brevis and the extensor longus digitorum. It becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the leg where it has been seen piercing the fascia. TIBIAL REaiON. This region corresponds to the subcutaneous or inner surface of the tibia. The deep fascia blends with the periosteum of the bone, and the only struc- tures which have to be examined are :â€” (i.) The internal saphenous vein. (2.) The internal saphenous nerve. (3.) The expanded tendons of insertion of the sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis. (4.) Internal lateralligament of knee-joint. (S-) Inferior internal articular artery and nerve. The interjtal saphenous nerve and vein are found ascending obliquely over the lower third of the inner surface of the tibia as they pass from the anterior to the posterior tibio-fibular region.

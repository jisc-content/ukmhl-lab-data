121 THE STOMACH. for the food after it has been masticated and swallowed. It has a somewhat pyriform shape, and is curved upon itself. Of course, its form and position are greatly influenced by the amount of food which it contains. In all probability, in the subject before you the stomach is empty, and the anterior and posterior walls flattened and in apposition with each other. When the stomach is distended, however, the sur- faces are convex. The anterior surface looks forwards and upwards, and is in relation to the under surface of the diaphragm, the under surface of the liver, and the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall. The posterior surface, on the other hand, looks backwards and downwards, and is related to the diaphragm, aorta, spleen, pancreas, the third part of the duodenum, and the left kidney and suprarenal capsule. The large rounded end of the stomach is called the cardiac extremity or the fundus, and is directed upwards so as to rest on the under surface of the diaphragm. The smaller end is termed the pylorus. It is directed to the right, and is continuous with the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum)â€”a slight constriction and thickening of the walls, mark- ing the point at which the one ends and the other begins. The right or upper border of the stomach is called the lesser curvature. It is concave, and, if it be followed towards the cardiac end of the organ, the oesophagus will be found entering the stomach at its upper extremity to the right of the fundus. The left or lower border, termed the greater curvature, is con- vex, and much longer than the lesser curvature.

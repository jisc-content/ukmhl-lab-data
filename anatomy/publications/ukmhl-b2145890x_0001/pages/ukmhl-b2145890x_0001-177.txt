THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. 165 in the posterior interventricular groove. Lastly, the obliqne vem of Marshall from the back of the left auricle opens into 'the sinus close to the point where it joins the right auricle. The orifice of this vein is devoid of a valve. The great cardiac vei?i (Fig. 10, p. 169) begins upon the anterior aspect of the heart at the apex. It ascends in the anterior interventricular groove to the auriculo- ventricular groove, in which it turns round the left margin of the heart to join the coronary sinus. On its way it is joined by numerous veins from the left ventricle and auricle. The anterior cardiac veins will be seen on the front of the right ventricle. They open directly into the right auricle (Fig. 9, p. 166, and Fig. 10, p. 169). But, in addition to these veins which appear upon the surface of the heart, there are minute vessels in the wall of the right auricle—the vence Thebesii—\hQ orifices of which will be recognised, when the right auricle is opened, as the foramina Thebesii. The cardiac veins, therefore, are very complicated in their arrangement, and do not correspond with the arteries.

60 ABDOMEN. Poupart's ligament, and, piercing the fascia lata, diverge from each other in the superficial fascia. The supei'-ficial pudic is directed inwards over the spermatic cord, and gives branches to the skin of the scrotum and under surface of the penis. TJie supe7'ficial circumflex iliac proceeds outwards and upwards along the line of Poupart's ligament, and ends in the skin in the neighbourhood of the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The superficial epigastric takes a vertical course upwards, and, crossing Poupart's ligament, ramifies in the superficial fascia over the lower part of the abdomen. Its branches extend as high as the level of the umbilicus. The small veins which accompany these arteries open into the internal saphenous vein. The Muscles of the Abdominal Wall.—The abdominal wall is formed anteriorly and laterally by five pairs of muscles, and by the aponeuroses which constitute their tendons. In front are the two recti muscles and the two pyramidales muscles. The recti are placed parallel to the middle line, and extend in a vertical direction from the pubic bones to the lower margin of the thorax. On each side three fleshy and aponeurotic strata are met with as we dissect from the surface towards the abdominal cavity. These strata are—(l.) the external oblique muscle ; (2.) the internal oblique muscle ; (3.) the transversalis muscle. The direction taken by the muscular fibres which compose each of these layers is different. The external oblique

152 ABDOMEN. mesenteric artery. It passes upwards upon the psoas muscle under cover of the peritoneum, to the left of, and at some distance from the artery, and, disappear- ing behind the pancreas, it ends in the splenic vein. The Inferior Mesenteric Plexus of Nerves is an offshoot from the left side of the aortic plexus. It closely surrounds the artery, and sends twigs along the branches of the vessel to supply the left half of the great intestine. Aortic Nervous Plexus.—If the peritoneum has been carefully stripped off the lower part of the aorta, there will be little difficulty in recognising and fol- lowing out the delicate nerves which form this plexus. Raise the third part of the duodenum from the sur- face of the aorta, and trace these nervous twigs upwards. The aortic plexus of nerves is placed upon the aorta between the origins of the two mesenteric arteries. It is more strongly marked upon the sides of the artery than in front of it. Superiorly it will be found to be continuous with the solar and renal plexuses, whilst inferiorly it sends numerous large branches downwards in front of the common iliac arteries to join the hypo- gastric plexus—a plexus which is situated in front of the upper part of the sacrum, and which will be after- wards dissected. Upon each side the aortic plexus will be observed to be reinforced by several small twigs from the gangliated cord of the sympathetic. We have already seen the inferior mesenteric plexus taking origin from it; it also gives off the spermatic (or

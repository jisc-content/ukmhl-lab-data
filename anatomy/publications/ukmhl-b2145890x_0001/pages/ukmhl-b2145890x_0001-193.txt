THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS. l8l occasional artery, may be seen to spring from it in some few cases. Left Common Carotid Artery—This artery ascends to the posterior aspect of the left sterno-clavi- cular articulation. At this point it leaves the thorax and enters the neck. It lies deeply in the thorax at a greater distance from the manubrium sterni than the innominate artery, hi front of this vessel are the remains of the thymus gland, and the left vena innom- inata, which crosses it. Behind, it is in relation to the trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct. To its left side is the left vagus nerve. It gives off no branches. Left Subclavian Artery.—Lies still more deeply within the thorax than the left carotid artery. It ascends almost vertically to the inner margin of the first rib, where it leaves the thorax and enters the root of the neck. In front, it is overlapped by the pleura and left lung, and is crossed by the left innominate vein. Belmid, it rests upon the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and longus colli muscle. To its inner or right side are the trachea, left vagus nerve, and left recurrent laryn- geal nerve. Deep Cardiac Plexus.—In order to dissect this plexus of nerves it is necessary to divide the arch of the aorta at the commencement and termination of its transverse portion. Two ligatures should be applied around the vessel at each of these points and the section made between them. This is done to prevent the escape of the injection with which the artery is filled. It is well also to sever the superior vena cava

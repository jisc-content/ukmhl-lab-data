67 ABDOMINAL WALL. margin of the muscle is bare, and the hand can be freely passed between it and the costal cartilages. On the left side of the body, the parts below the horizontal line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the outer border of the rectus, and along which the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle has been divided, should be preserved intact for the special study of those parts which are related to inguinal hernia. On the right side of the body divide the lower part of the aponeurosis along the outer border of the rectus to the pubes. This incision should pass to the inner side of the internal pillar of the external abdominal ring, so that this opening may be preserved. The triangular flap of aponeurosis may now be thrown downwards and outwards. By this proceeding we can study more successfully Poupart's ligament, the entire extent of the internal oblique muscle, and the cremaster muscle. Poupart's Ligament.* —Poupart's ligament is merely the thickened lower border of the aponeurosis of the external oblique folded backwards upon itself. It thus presents a rounded surface towards the thigh and a grooved surface towards the abdominal cavity. The manner in which it is attached by its outer and inner extremities deserves the close study of the dissector. Externally it is fixed to the anterior superior spine of the ilium ; internally it has a double attachment — viz., (i.) to the pubic spine, which * The term superficial crural arch is frequently applied to this liga- ment.

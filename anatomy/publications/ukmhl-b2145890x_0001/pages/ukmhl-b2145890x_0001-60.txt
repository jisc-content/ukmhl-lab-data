48 UPPER LIMB. the extensor communis and the extensor carpi radiahs brevior in the lower third of the forearm. The next step in the dissection consists in reflecting the extensor communis digitorum and extensor minimi digiti. Do this by cutting through the fleshy belly about its middle, and throwing the parts upwards and downwards. Proceed with caution, so as to avoid injury to the nerve-twigs from the posterior interosseous nerve, which enter them on their deep surface. The Deep Muscles are now exposed, but before cleaning these, trace the nerves and arteries to their distribution. The posterior interosseous nerve will be seen immerging from the substance of the supinator brevis. Follow its branches to the different muscles and also its terminal branch, which will subsequently be seen to end on the posterior aspect of the wrist- joint. The posterior interosseous artery appears in the interval between the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. It exhausts itself in the supply of the muscles and anastomoses with the anterior interosseous. The perforating branch of the anterior interosseous artery enters the extensor aspect of the forearm by piercing the interosseous membrane at the upper border of the pronator quadratus. Follow it downwards to the wrist. The deep muscles must in the next place be examined. From above downwards^he dissector will meet with the supinator brevis, the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the extensor primi internodii

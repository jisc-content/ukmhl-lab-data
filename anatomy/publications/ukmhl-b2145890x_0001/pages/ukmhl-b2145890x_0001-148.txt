Hallux. (2.) Index. (3.) Medius. (4.) Tibial side of annularis. f (i.) Fibular side of annularis. (2.) Minimus. External plantar nerve. Muscles. (i.) Flexor brevis digitorum. (2.) Abductor hallucis. (3.) Flexor brevis hallucis. (4.) First and second lum- brical muscles. (i.) Accessorius. (2.) Abductor minimi digiti. (3.) Flexor brevis minimi di- giti. (4.) Third and fourth lumbri- cal muscles. (5.) Adductor hallucis. (6.) Transversus pedis. (7.) The interossei muscles. The plantar arch and the branches which proceed from it must now be studied. At its inner part it is covered by the adductor hallucis and the flexor brevis hallucis. The former has already been turned aside. The short flexor of the hallux is still in its place, and it is necessary therefore that it should be thrown forward from its origin, A little dissection will show that the arch is completed by the dorsalis pedis arteiy, which enters the sole at the back part of the interosseous space. From this arterial arcade the following branches are given ofl"—{a^ four digital arteries from the con- ' vexity ; {b}) several miiscidar twigs from the concavity ;

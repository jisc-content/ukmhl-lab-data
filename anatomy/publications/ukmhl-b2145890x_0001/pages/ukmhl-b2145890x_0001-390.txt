154 ABDOMEN. The gastro-duodenaUnsQS close to the pyloric artery, and is directed downwards behind the first part of the duodenum, at the lower border of which it ends by dividing into the superior pancreatico-duodenal and the right gastro-epiploic. The superior pancreatico-duodenal takes a curved course round the head of the pancreas, between it and the duodenum, to both of which it gives branches. It ends by inosculating with the inferiorpa7icreatico-duo- denal hronch. of the superior mesenteric artery. ^ The right gastro-epiploic is directed from right to left, along the greater curvature of the stomach, and between the two anterior layers of the great omentum. It gives branches upwards to both surfaces of the stomach, and downwards to the great omentum, and ends by anastomosing with the left gastro-epiploic, a branch of the splenic. The right and left hepatic arteries, the terminal branches of the hepatic, diverge from each other, and sink into the liver at the two extremities of the trans- verse fissure. From the right hepatic a small branch called the cystic is given to the gall-bladder. ^ This divides into two twigs, one of which ramifies in the areolar tissue between the liver and gall-bladder, and the other upon the dependent surface of the gall- bladder. , . The cystic vein joins the vena portse or its rignt branch. The Splenic Artery, the largest branch of the coeliac axis, takes a wavy or tortuous course to the left side,

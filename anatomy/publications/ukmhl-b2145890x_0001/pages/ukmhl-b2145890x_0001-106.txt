94 LOWER LIMB. attached above to the crest of the ilium ; the deep layer can be followed upwards to the capsule of the hip-joint, with the upper and outer part of which it blends. This layer is perforated by the ascending twigs of the external circumflex artery. Now turn the muscle outwards so as to display its deep surface. A little dissection will bring into view its nerve of supply, which comes from the superior gluteal. A few arterial twigs from the external circumflex also sink into its substance at this point. External Circumflex Artery.—The branches of this vessel must now be followed to their terminations. Three sets of branches can be distinguished:—(a.) Ascending, which reach the dorsum ilii by passing under cover of the tensor fasciae femoris. There they anas- tomose with the gluteal artery. ((5.) Descending, which run downwards. Of these one long branch may be traced downwards amid the fibres of the vastus exter- nus to the knee, where it anastomoses with the superior external articular 2s\.QXY. (^.) Transverse, oi v^xy ^.m-dSS. size, which penetrate the substance of the vastus externus to reach the back of the thigh, and there anastomose with the internal circmnflex and first per - forating arteries. Quadriceps Extensor Muscle and the Inter- muscular Septa.—Divide the ilio-tibial band of fascia lata below the point at which it splits to enclose the tensor fascia femoris. We do this so as to obtain a better view of the vastus externus, and in order that we may demonstrate satisfactorily of the ex-

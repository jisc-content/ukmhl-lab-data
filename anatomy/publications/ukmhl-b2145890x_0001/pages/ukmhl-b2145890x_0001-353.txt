THE PERITONEUM. 129 The recULin will be described with the pelvic viscera. Adaptation of the Abdominal Walls to the Viscera, and of the "^iscera to each other.— The abdomen is an air-tight cavity, and the atmo- spheric pressure acts upon its mobile walls so as to keep them constantly in accurate apposition with the viscera, and also the viscera in accurate contact with each other. During life and in the undissected sub- ject no space of any kind is left vacant, and con- sequently some anatomists decline to apply the term "cavity" to the abdomen. The external configura- tion of the solid organs within the abdomen is, to a great extent, determined by this close adapta- tion of walls to contents, and viscus to viscus. The liver is the best example of this—almost every structure with which it is in contact leaves its mark upon it, in the form of a depression, whilst its upper surface presents an exact mould of the under surface of the diaphragm. The Peritoneum.—The peritoneum is the serous membrane which lines the walls of the abdominal cavity, and gives more or less complete coverings to all the viscera within it. In the male it is a closed sac like other serous membranes. In the female, however, there is a small opening at the extremity of the Fallo- pian tube, by means of which the lumen of this tube communicates with the interior of the sac. It differs from other serous sacs in its great size, and also in its many complications. Take, for example, the pleura PART II. ^

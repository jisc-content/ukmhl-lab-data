ig2> ABDOMEN. T/ie Lateral Attachment.—The costal origin consists of six pointed and fleshy slips which spring^ from the deep surfaces of the lower six costal cartilages. These interdigitate with the digitations of the trans- versalis abdominis. The sternal and costal origins of the diaphragm are separated by a small triangular interval, in which the pleural and peritoneal mem- branes are merely separated from each other by some loose areolar tissue. Through this gap the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery descends into the abdominal wall. The Posterior Attachment—The ligamentum arcua- tum externum is a fibrous band which stretches from the last rib to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. It arches in front of the quadratus lumborum, and is merely the thickened upper part of the fascia which covers this muscle-^>., the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. By pressing the rib backwards the arch will be rendered more prominent. The ligamentum arcuatum internum arches over the psoas muscle, and, like the external ligament, is simply a thickening of the fascia which covers it. It is the stronger of the two, and is attached by one extremity to the tip of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and by the other to the body of the second lumbar vertebra and the tendinous part of the crus. Fleshy fibres arise from both of these arcuate bands; those from the internal ligament are more numerous and better marked than those which take origin from the external ligament, and they are continuous with the fleshy fibres of the crus. Very frequently a slight

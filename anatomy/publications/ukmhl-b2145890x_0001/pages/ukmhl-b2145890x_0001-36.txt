24 UPPER LIMB. quadrilateral space is brought strikingly under the notice of the student. Lastly, trace the anterior circumflex artery outwards as it passes under cover of the short head 'of biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. Note how it ends by dividing at the bicipital groove into two branches. Scapular Muscles.—The supraspinatus, infraspin- atus, and teres minor on the dorsum scapulae, and the subscapularis on the venter scapulae must now be examined. The acromion process should be divided with the saw close to its junction with the spine of the scapula, in order that an uninterrupted view of the supraspinatus may be obtained. Reflect these muscles by dividing them at their middle, and dissect the outer portions outwards, so as to display the close connection of these muscles with the capsule of the shoulder-joint. In doing this tike care of the suprascapular artery and nerve and the dorsalis scapulcB artery on the dorsum of the scapula. In the case of the subscapularis, and perhaps also in the case of the infraspinatus, a bursa will be found intervening between the muscle and the capsule of the joint. Open these with the knife and introduce the tip of the finger. The finger will pass directly into the cavity of the joint, demonstrating the fact that these bursae are merely hernial protrusions of the synovial membrane. • The Suprascapular Artery and Nerve.—These have already been partially exposed on the dorsum scapulae, and they must now be cleaned, and their branches followed out.

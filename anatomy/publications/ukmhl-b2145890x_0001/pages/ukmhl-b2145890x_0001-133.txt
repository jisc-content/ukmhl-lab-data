POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 121 of the posterior aspect of the os calcis, and then separate the soleus from its extensive attachments to the tibia and fibula. As these superficial muscles are being thrown downwards, it is necessary to divide the sural arteries, and also the nerves which are given to them by the internal popliteal. Entering the deep surface of the soleus are a number of arterial twigs from the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries which must also be severed after they have been cleaned and defined. The tendo-Achillis should now be drawn forcibly backwards from its attachment to the os calcis. A slight touch of the knife between the tendon and the bone will display the cavity of the synovial sac which intervenes between them at this point. Posterior Tibial Vessels and Nerve.â€”The termination of the popliteal artery is not exposed until the soleus is reflected. It should now be cleaned, and it will be seen to end at the lower margin of the popliteus muscle by dividing into the anteidor and posterior tibial arteries. Further, the venae comites which accompany these vessels will be observed to join at this point to form the large popliteal vein. The anterior tibial artery passes forwards between the two heads of the tibialis posticus muscle, to the front of the leg, where it has already been dissected. Remove the layer of fascia which intervenes between the superficial and deep muscles, and define the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. Do this carefully so as not to injure the branches which proceed from them. The artery is placed between the two venae

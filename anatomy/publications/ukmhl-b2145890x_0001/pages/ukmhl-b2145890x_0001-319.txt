ABDOMINAL WALL. 95 In cases of large herniae of old standing, however, they become thickened, and can easily be separated. From the above description the student will under- stand that there is only one tunic common to both testicles—viz., the integument; that the superficial fascia and dartos, and the investments derived from the abdominal wall, constitute special tunics for each testicle. Spermatic Cord.—The spermatic cord has been seen entering the inguinal canal through the internal abdominal ring; it has been followed as it traverses the canal, and it has been observed to issue from it through the external abdominal ring. It is now seen as it lies within the scrotum suspending the testicle. Before dissecting out the constituent parts of the cord, turn your attention for a little to the extra- peritoneal fatty tissue which lies behind the internal abdominal ring. Note that a process of this tissue is prolonged downwards with the cord. Now with the handle of the knife gently separate the extra-peritoneal fat from the subjacent peritoneum. You will observe that behind the internal abdominal ring the peritoneum shows a slight bulging forwards, and perhaps you may be able to detect a slender fibrous band passing into the cord from the most prominent part of this bulging. This fibrous cord is the remains of the tube of peritoneum, which in the foetus connected the serous investment of the testicle (the tunica vaginalis) with the general peritoneal lining of the

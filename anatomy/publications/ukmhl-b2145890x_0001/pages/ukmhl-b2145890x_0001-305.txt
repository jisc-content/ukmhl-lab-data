ABDOMINAL WALL. 8i arises by two heads; of these, the external and larger is attached to the pubic crest, whilst the in- ternal and smaller is fixed to the ligaments in front of the symphysis pubis. Towards the chest the muscle widens and becomes thinner, and its insertion is effected by three large slips into the anterior aspect of the costal cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seveitth ribs. The rectus muscle is broken up into portions by irregular tendinous intersections — the inscriptiones tendinece or linecB transversce. These are usually three in number, and • are placed, one at the level of the umbilicus, another opposite the ensiform cartilage, and a third midway between. A fourth intersection is sometimes found below the umbilicus. We have seen that these tendinous intersections are closely adherent to the sheath of the rectus in front. Raise the muscle, and you will observe that they have no attachment to the sheath behind. Pyramidalis Muscle.—This is a small triangular muscle—not always present—which springs from the front of the pubes and the ligaments of the symphysis, and is inserted into the linea alba. It lies upon the lower part of the rectus, and is supposed to act as a tensor of the linea alba. Sheath of the Rectus.—The dissector is now in a position to study the manner in which the rectal sheath is formed. An examination of^the relations which the aponeuroses of the three flat muscles of the abdomen bear to the rectus, will show that the PART II. r

i8 ABDOMEN. Other. These are the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum. The corpora cavernosa constitute the chief bulk of the organ. They are placed side by side like the two barrels of a double-barrelled gun. They form the dorsum and sides of the penis, and are partially blended with each other along the middle lineâ€”indeed the only surface indication of the double nature of this portion of the penis are two median longitudinal grooves which run one along its upper and the other along its lower aspect. The corpus spongiosum is slender in comparison with the corpora cavernosa, and is lodged in the groove which extends along the lower aspect of these bodies. To carry out our simile, then, the corpus spongiosum would correspond in position to the ramrod of the double-barrelled gun; and, on account of this, the body of the penis has a somewhat prismatic form. The corpus spongiosum is traversed throughout its whole extent by the urethra. If these three constituents of the penis be traced backwards, the student will observe that opposite the lower part of the symphysis pubis they separate from each other and become attached to parts in the super- ficial area of the urethral triangle. The corpora caver- nosa diverge widely from each other, and now they receive the name of the crura of the penis. Each crus is fixed firmly to the corresponding side of the pubic arch by an attachment which extends from the sub- pubic ligament backwards to the tuberosity of the ischium. Close to the point where it becomes contin- uous with the corresponding corpus cavernosum it

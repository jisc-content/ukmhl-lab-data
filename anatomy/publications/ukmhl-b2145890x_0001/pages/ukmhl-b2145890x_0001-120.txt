io8 LOWER LIMB. continued round the limb to the back of the leg. But as we turn it outwards two strong intermuscular septa will be demonstrated passing towards the fibula, to which they are attached. Of these one is interposed between the peroneal muscles and the extensor longus digitorum (Fig. 7, b), whilst the other is placed between the peroneal muscles and the flexor longus hallucis and soleus muscles (Fig. 7, c). Three osteo-fascial compart- ments are thus formed, and within these are enclosed the structures in the anterior tibio-fibular, peroneal, and posterior tibio-fibular regions respectively. Muscles.â€”The muscles on the front of the leg and the extensor brevis digitorum on the dorsum of the foot should now be cleaned and defined. The tibialis anticus lies in relation to the tibia; the extensor longus digitorum is placed along the fibula ; and, on separating these two muscles from each other, the extensor longus hallucis will be observed lying between them in the lower half of the leg. Theperoneus tertius is simply the lower portion of the extensor longus digitorum. It is in most cases inseparably blended with it at its origin. In the upper third of the leg a strong intermuscular septum from the deep fascia will be seen to dip back- wards between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum, and to afford a surface of origin to both. The two muscles should be separated from each other along the plane of this septum. The tendons of these muscles should now be followed downwards through their respective compartments in the anterior annular ligament to the dorsum of the

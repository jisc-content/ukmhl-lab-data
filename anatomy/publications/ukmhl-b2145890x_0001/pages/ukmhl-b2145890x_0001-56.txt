44 UPPER LIMB. and the other from the nerve which bifurcates at the cleft between the index and middle fingers. The digital branches of the median may be traced to both sides of the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and to the radial margin of the ring finger. Anterior Annular Ligament.â€”This should now be studied. Observe how it stretches across the arch of the carpus so as to form a tunnel, through which pass the tendons of the flexor sublimis, flexor profundus, and flexor longus pollicis, along with the median nerve. Make out its precise connections and relations, and note how it is pierced at its external attachment by the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. The synovial sac which lines the canal and envelopes the tendons and nerve deserves a very careful examination, and if it has not been injured its extent may be strikingly demonstrated by inflating it by means of a blow-pipe. The Plexor Sheaths binding the two tendons to the anterior aspect of the fingers should be cleaned and examined, and then opened by a vertical cut along the middle line of the fingers. The synovial lining, the mode of insertion of the two tendons, and the vincula accessoria can now be made out. DEEP DISSECTION OP PALM. Throw forward the superficial palmar arch and the median and ulnar nerves. To do this the ulnar artery must be severed immediately below the point at which it gives off the profunda branch.

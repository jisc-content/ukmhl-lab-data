ABDOMEN. 142 but it is convenient to describe it with the others. It is a fibrous cord, in fact the obliterated umbiHcal vein, which extends from the umbilicus upwards, back- wards, and to the right, to the anterior part of the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver. Th^ falciform ligament, also called the broad or the suspensory ligament, is a double layer of peritoneum of a triangular shape. By its anterior harder it is attached to the anterior wall of the abdomen, and to the under surface of the diaphragm, whilst by its posterior border it is fixed to the upper surface of the liver so as to mark it off into a right and left lobe. Its lower border or base is free, and contains be- tween its two peritoneal layers the ligamentum teres. At its apex, which is directed backwards, the two layers of peritoneum diverge from each other—the one passing to the right, and the other to the left, so as to form the upper layer of the coronary ligament. The coronary ligament.—To understand this ligament aright it must be borne in mind that an'irregular area on the posterior border of the liver is devoid of peritoneum, and that this area is in direct apposition with the diaphragm, to which it is connected by some loose areolar tissue. The peritoneum covering the upper surface of the liver is reflected at the upper limit of this bare area directly on to the diaphragm ; this reflection constitutes the upper layer of the coron- ary ligament. The low'er layer of the ligament is formed at the lower limit of the bare area by the reflection of the peritoneum from the under surface of the liver on to the diaphragm. The two layers, there-

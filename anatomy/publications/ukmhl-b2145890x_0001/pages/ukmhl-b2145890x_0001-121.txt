ANTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. IO9 foot Here they will be found to diverge so as to reach their various points of insertion—the tendon of the tibialis anticus inclining inwards so as to be inserted into the plantar aspect of the internal cuneiform bone and the base of the first metatarsal; the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis running towards the hallux, into the terminal phalanx of which it is inserted ; the four tendons of the extensor passing one to each of the four outer toes; and the tendon of the peroneus tertius inclining outwards so as to reach its insertion into the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Notice also the manner in which the tendons of the extensor brevis digitorum are inserted. They go to the four inner toes ; the innermost is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three join the corresponding tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. The expansion formed by the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum upon the dorsum of the first phalanx of each of the four outer toes should be examined and preserved. In a subsequent dissection the interossei muscles and the lumbrical muscles will be found to be inserted into its borders. This expansion as we trace it forwards will be found to be marked off into three pronounced slips. The middle slip is in- serted into the base of the middle phalanx and the two lateral slips continue onwards, and are inserted into the ungual phalanx. Anterior Tibial Artery.—The anterior tibial vessels should now be studied. They come from the posterior

46 ABDOMEN. been exposed by the removal of the erector muscles. To obtain a good view of the entire organ, strip the mucous membrane from the body of the clitoris, and clear away the loose tissue which surrounds it. In doing this, however, remember that on its dorsal aspect certain vessels and nerves run forwards to reach the glans, and that suspending it to the front of the pubes there is the suspensory ligament. The body of the clitoris is composed of two cylm- drical erectile bodies called the corpora cavernosa, which correspond with the structures that bear the same name in the male. Along the middle line they are united by their inner surfaces, and the erectile tissue of the one is separated from that of the other by an imperfect pectiniform septum. The body of the clitoris is about an inch and a-half long. Anteriorly it termin- ates in a small rounded tubercle, which bears the name of the glans clitoridis. The glans, however, is not structurally continuous with the corpora cavernosa. It is a little mass of erectile tissue continuous with the pars intermedia, and fitting into a slight con- cavity which is formed for its reception on the extremities of the corpora cavernosa. Posteriorly, opposite the lower part of the symphysis pubis, the corpora cavernosa separate, and diverging widely from each other, form the crura clitoridis. Each crus is attached by its deep surface to the rami of the pubis and ischium, and is covered by its own erector muscle. The clitoris, then, consists of three parts a Hans continuous with the pars intermedia ; {2J) a body composed of two corpora cavernosa lying side by side

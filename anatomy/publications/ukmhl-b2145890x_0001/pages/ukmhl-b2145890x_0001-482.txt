Then passing to the inner side of the ureter, it reaches the base of the viscus, where it becomes dilated and slightly sacculated, and lies upon the inner side of the seminal vesicle. As it proceeds onwards, it gradually inclines towards the mesial plane, and at the base of the prostate it is joined by the narrow end of the vesicula seminalis of its own side.

This line, taken in conjunction with the converging vasa deferentia and vesiculse seminales, maps off a triangular space upon the base of the bladder—the apex of which is at the base of the prostate, whilst the base is formed by the reflection of the peritoneum. Within the limits of this triangle the base of the

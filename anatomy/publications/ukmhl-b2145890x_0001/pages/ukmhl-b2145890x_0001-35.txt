SHOULDER—SCAPULAR REGION. 25 retain it in this position by means of hooks. The fibres of the muscle are in this way kept tense. Circumflex Vessels and Nerve.—The Hmb should now be placed upon its posterior aspect and the posterior circumflex artery, and the circumflex nerve traced backwards through the quadrilateral space— defining at the same time the boundaries of the space. The dorsalis scapulce artery may also be followed into the triangidar space to the point at which it disappears around the axillary margin of the scapula under cover of the teres minor. Reflection of the Deltoid.—This constitutes the next step in the dissection. Divide the muscle close to its origin from the clavicle, acromion process, and spine of the scapula, and throw it downwards. An equally good way of reflecting this muscle is to detach it from its insertion and throw it upwards. A large bursa situated between the deltoid and the superior part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint will now come into view. This should be opened and its extent explored by introducing the finger into its interior. It will be found not merely to intervene between the deltoid and the capsular ligament, but also to extend between the coraco-acromial arch and the ligament. In the latter position it goes under the title of the sub- acromial bursa. The ramifications of the posterior circiLinflex artery and the circumflex upon the deep surface of the deltoid can now be dissected out. The branch of the latter to the tei'es minor and the ganglionic swelling upon it are seen, and the

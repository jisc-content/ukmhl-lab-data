202 ABDOMEN. dorsal vertebra. In some cases its anterior border is tendinous, and formed by the posterior margin of the central tendon. Posteriorly it is separated from the aortic opening by the decussation of the internal fibres, of the crura. The oesophageal opening transmits the gullet and the two pneumogastric nerves. The three large openings of the diaphragm are therefore very different in their features. The aortic opening is a fibrous ring behind the diaphragm, and it can in no way be affected by the contraction of the muscular fibres. The vena caval opening is in the central tendon, and its margins are attached to the wall of the vessel which it transmits ; contraction of the diaphragm must therefore have a tendency to widen this aperture. The (esophageal opening is placed in the muscular part, and consequently it is highly probable that the fibres which surround it may be capable of exercising a constricting influence upon the oesophagus, and in this way help to prevent regurgi- tation of food during the descent of the diaphragm. Little need be said regarding the smaller foramina. Each crus is pierced by the three splanchnic nerves, and the left crus is likewise perforated by the vena azygos minor. Keep in mind also that the superior epigastric artery descends in the interval between the sternal and costal attachments of the diaphragm, and that the musculo-phrenic artery pierces the costal attachment opposite the eighth or ninth rib.

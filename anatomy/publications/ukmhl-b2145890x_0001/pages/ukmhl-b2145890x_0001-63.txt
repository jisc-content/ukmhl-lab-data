DORSAL ASPECT OF THE WRIST AND HAND. 5 I the digits especial care must be taken in cleaning the dorsal expansion on the back of the first phalanx of each finger. The tendons of insertion of the lum- bricales and interossei muscles will be seen joining this. Posterior Interosseous Nerve.—In the forearm the terminal branch of this nerve sinks under cover of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and should now be followed to the back of the wrist, where it ends in a gangliform enlargement, from which articular twigs proceed. Interossei Muscles.—These must be dissected both on the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. The four dorsal will be found one in each intermeta- carpal space. The three palmar lie in relation to the metacarpal bones of the index, ring, and little fingers. The articulations of the upper limb should now be dissected. In doing this follow the method recom- mended in your text-book of Practical Anatomy.

208 ABDOMEN. The renal veins join the vena cava. The vein of the left side crosses in front of the aorta, and is the long-er of the two. Both receive twigs from the supra- renal bodies, and the left vein is also joined by the left spermatic or ovarian vein. The Spermatic Arteries are two long slender vessels which spring from the front of the abdominal aorta a short way below the renal arteries. Diverg- ing from each other, each artery passes obliquely downwards and outwards behind the peritoneum, to the internal abdominal ring where it joins the other factors of the spermatic cord. As it descends it rests upon the psoas, and crosses the ureter and the exter- nal iliac 'artery. On the right side, the spermatic artery passes in front of the vena cava inferior. In the female the corresponding arteries go to the ovaries and uterus, and are consequently termed the ovarian. Within the abdomen proper they have the same relations as the spermatic arteries. In the dissection of the female pelvis they will be followed to their destination. The right spermatic vein joins the vena cava directly, whilst the left vein terminates in the left renal vein. The ovarian veins end in the same manner. The Lumbar Arteries—four in number on each side—spring from the posterior aspect of the abdom- inal aorta, in series with the intercostal arteries. At present they are only seen in a very short part of their course. They proceed outwards upon the bodies

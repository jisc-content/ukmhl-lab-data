75 BACK OF THE THIGH. to the back of the thigh. In a well-injected subject the terminal twig of its middle division will be noticed appearing from amidst the fibres of the vastus externus at its upper part. It may be seen to anas- tomose with the first perforating and the internal ' circumflex. The internal circumflex artery has already been observed in the gluteal region, appearing between the contiguous margins of the adductor magnus and the quadratus femoris muscles. Adductor Magnus.—To bring this muscle more fully into view, and at the same time to facilitate the process of cleaning its radiating fibres, it is well to reflect the hamstring muscles from their origins. First divide the conjoined tendon of the biceps and semi- tendinosus. This displays the precise origin of the semimembranosus, and when the dissector has again looked at this under the present more advantageous circumstances, he should divide it also. Anastomosis on the Posterior Aspect of the Limb.—In a well-injected subject a chain of anasto- mosis, in which every link is complete, can be traced from the gluteal region down the back of the thigh to the popliteal space. The present is the best time to study this. Commencing above, we find the gluteal artery anastomosing with the sciatic and the sciatic with the internal circumflex. In the back of the thigh this chain is carried downwards by the internal cir- cumflex anastomosing with the first perforating, each perforating artery inosculating with the one below it,

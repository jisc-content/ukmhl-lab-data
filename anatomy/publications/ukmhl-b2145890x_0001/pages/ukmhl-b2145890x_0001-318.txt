g4 ABDOMEN. When the skin is removed the superficial fascia is observed to possess certain characters pecuHar to itself. It has a ruddy colour, and is totally devoid of fat. The ruddy tint is due to the presence of involuntary muscular fibres, which take the place of the fat, and constitute what is called the dartos muscle.' The rugosity of the scrotal skin is main- tained by these muscular fibres. But further, the superficial fascia forms in the interior of the scrotum an imperfect septum or partition, which divides it into two chambers-one for each testicle. These points in connection with the construction of the scrotum have all, to a certain degree, been noted in the dissection of the perineum. But these two scrotal tunics are not the only coverings of the testicle. Each constituent of the abdominal wall has been seen to contribute an investment to the spermatic cord, and this in turn is continued down so as to clothe the testicle. Presuming, then, that the skin and superficial fascia are reflected, the testicle and cord within the scrotum will still be found to be invested by— (i.) The external spermatic or intercolumnar fascia from the aponeurosis of the external obHque. (2) The cremasteric fascia—the muscular element of which is partly derived from the internal oblique. (3.) The infundibuliform fascia from the fascia transvers- alis. The dissectors will find it difficult to demonstrate in every case these different investments of the testicle.

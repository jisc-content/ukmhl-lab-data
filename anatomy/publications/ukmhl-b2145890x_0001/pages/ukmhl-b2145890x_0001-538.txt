312 ABDOMEN. and uniform. After this period, however, it becomes scarred and puckered from the breaches which are made by the escape of the ova from the Graafian follicles. Parovarium, or the Organ of RosenmuUer.— This structure is of interest because it is the repre- sentative of the epididymis in the male. It is some- what triangular in form, and will be discovered by an attentive examination of that portion of the broad lis-ament of the uterus which stretches between the ovary and the Fallopian tube. Its apex is directed towards the former, and its base towards the latter; but it is free between the two layers of the ligament, and not connected with either. In structure it will be seen to consist of a number of tubules which radiate from the apex of the body and are joined together by a longitudinal tube (the homologue of the duct of Gsertner in the cow, &c.), which extends along its base. The Fallopian Tubes or Oviducts.—These are two tubes which have as their function the conveyance of the ova or eggs from the ovary to the uterus. Each duct is about three or four inches long, and is con- tained within the superior free border of the broad ligament of the uterus. Its inner extremity pierces the uterus at its superior angle, whilst its outer end is situated about an inch beyond the ovary and opens into the peritoneal cavity by a constricted orifice, sur- rounded by numbers of fringe-like processes, called fimbrice. By one of these fimbriae it has already been

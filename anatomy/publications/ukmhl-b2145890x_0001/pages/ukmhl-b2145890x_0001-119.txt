ANTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 10/ and bridges over the hollow between the external malleolus and the os calcis. The deep fascia must now be removed, but the annular ligaments should be retained and their borders " defined by the knife. In the upper part of the le" it will be found impossible to separate the fascia from the subjacent muscles. At a lower level it can be readily raised, and this should be effected by divid- ing it longitudinally along the middle line. As we a Fig. 7. Diagram to show the osteo-fascial compartments of the leg. t. Tibia ; f. Fibula, both of which are seen in transverse section. The general aponeurotic covering of the leg is represented fusing with the periosteum over the subcutaneous or inner surface of the tibia ; a. Interosseous membrane ; b. The intermuscular septum which intervenes between the peroneal muscles and the extensor longus digitorum ; c, The septum between the peroneal muscles and the flexor longus hallucis and soleus. The three osteo-fascial compartments are mapped out and their contents indicated. The posterior compartment is subdivided into two parts by the deep layer of fascia, d; as is usual in the case of muscles contained within such compartments, each group has its own distinctive nerve-supply. dissect it inwards, its firm attachment to the anterior border of the tibia will be noticed. Externally it is

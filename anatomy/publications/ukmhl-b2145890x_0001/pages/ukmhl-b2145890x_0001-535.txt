FEMALE PELVIS. 309 narrower than the body, and more uniformly rounded. It projects into the upper end of the vagina, the walls of which are attached to the uterus around it. To obtain a satisfactory view of the cervix uteri, it is necessary to slit up the vagina along its lateral aspect and to remove the stuffing. The posterior wall of the vagina will then be seen to ascend to a higher level upon the cervix than the anterior wall; or, in other words, the anterior wall of the vagina will'be observed to be considerably shorter than the posterior wall. On the lower extremity of the cervix there is an aperture called the os uteri externum. In the virgin this opening is circular, but in females that have borne children it is usually transverse and some- what irregular in outline. It is bounded by two full rounded lips. Comparing these it will be noticed that the anterior lip is the thicker of the two, whilst the posterior is the longer. Although the anterior lip is the shorter it should be noted that, on account of the oblique position of the uterus, it is placed at a lower level in the vagina. The greater length of the posterior lip is due to the wall of the vagina passing higher up on that aspect of the uterus. The relations of the uterus should next be studied Posteriorly, it is invested completely by peritoneum and IS separated from the rectum by the recto- vagmal cul-de-sac, and any coils of small intestine which this may chance to contain. Anteriorly, it is â€¢covered m its upper three-fourths by peritoneum below which it is in apposition with the base of the bladder.

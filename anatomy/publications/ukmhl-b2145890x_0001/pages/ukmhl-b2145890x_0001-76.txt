4 64 LOWER LIMB. disappears under cover of the gemelli and obturator internus to reach the quadratus. On its way it gives a small offset to the gemellus inferior. It is accom- panied by a small arterial twig from the sciatic artery. Obturator and Internal Circumflex Arteries.— In the interval between the quadratus femoris and gemellus inferior we find a small branch of the internal circumflex artery, and sometimes a minute arterial twig from tke obturator artery. In the interval between the margins of the quadratus and adductor magnus the termination of the internal circumflex artery will be discovered. Reflection of Gluteus Minimus, Obturator Internus, and Quadratus Femoris.—The last step in the dissection of the gluteal region consists in the reflection of three muscles—viz., the gluteus minimus, the obturator internus, and the quadratus femoris. The gluteus minimus must be detached from its origin and thrown downwards. We have three objects in view in undertaking this dissection—(i.) The display of the posterior surface of the capsular ligament of the hip-joint; (2.) The demonstration of a bursa which intervenes between the tendon of the muscle and the great trochanter; (3.) The exhibition of the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris which arises from the dorsum of the acetabulum. The tendon of the obturator internus should be divided close to its insertion into the upper margin of the great trochanter. On turning it backwards we brina- into view a synovial sac which intervenes

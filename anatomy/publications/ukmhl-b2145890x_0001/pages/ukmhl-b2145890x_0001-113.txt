lOI FRONT OF THE THIGH. it come under his notice at two different points—(i.) In the present dissection, appearing in relation to the obturator externus and anastomosing with the internal circumflex; (2.) In the gluteal region in the interval between the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus. The psoas and iliacus must next be studied and their insertion defined. Removal of the Limb from the Trunk.—The limb should now be removed from the trunk. This dissection involves the study of the hip-joint. The steps by which it may be effected are the following :— Begin by dividing the femoral vessels and the anterior crural nerve about an inch below Poupart's ligament, and having tied them together with twine throw them downwards. Now cut through the sartorius and rectus femoris about two inches from their origin ai;id turn them aside. The common tendon of the psoas and iliacus must next be severed a short way above its insertion and the two muscles raised from the anterior aspect of the capsule of the hip-joint. In doing this an intervening bursal sac will be displayed. Open this and ascertain its extent by introducing the finger. In some cases it may be found to be directly continuous with the synovial membrane of the hip- joint through an aperture in the capsular ligament. The capsular ligament should now be carefully studied, not only in regard to its attachments, the disposition of its fibres, and its relative strength at different points, but also in regard to the various parts

JO ABDOMEN. whilst in front it is pierced by the hypogastric branch of the iHo-hypogastric and by the ilio-inguinal nerve. The former of these appears near the anterior superior iHac spine, and then proceeds forwards under cover of the external oblique aponeurosis, which it soon pierces. The ilio-inguinal nerve will be found perforating the internal oblique a little way in front of the hypo- gastric nerve and at a lower level. It becomes superficial by passing through the external abdominal ring. The internal oblique muscle (Fig. 9) arises—{\:) from | the abdominal grooved surface of Poupart's ligament in its outer half; (2.) from the middle lip of the anterior two-thirds of the iliac crest; (3.) from the lumbar apo- neurosis. From this origin the muscular fibres radiate, but the general direction is from below upwards and forwards. The posterior fibres ascend, and are inserted into the lower borders of the cartilages of the lower four ribs. These fibres occupy the same plane as the i internal intercostal muscles—indeed, they will be ob- ) served to be directly continuous with the fibres of the internal intercostal muscles of the two lower spaces. The lower fibres, or those springing from Poupart's liga- ^ ment, arch downwards and inwards, and join with the , lower fibres of the transversalis in a flat tendon, called the conjoined tendon, which is inserted into the crest of the pubes, and into the ilio-pectineal line, for fully half-an-inch of its extent. The intermediate fibres proceed upwards and forwards, and end in a strong aponeurosis, which extends from the lower margin of the chest to the pubis. By this aponeurosis they gain

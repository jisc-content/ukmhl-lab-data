DISSECTION OF THE BACK. 5 In the case of the left trapezius the student must begin at the lower margin of the muscle and work upwards to the level of the seventh cervical vertebra. He will there be met by the dissector of the head and neck. The limb must in the first instance be extended and then placed by the side as the transverse fibres of the muscle are reached. Latissimus Dorsi Muscle.â€”The same precautions are to be taken in clearing the fascia from the surface of the latissimus dorsi. The muscular fibres are fully stretched by raising the arm and folding it under the neck. The latissimus dorsi is a difficult muscle to clean. Both layers of fascia should be raised together. As the muscle sweeps over the inferior angle of the scapula it usually receives a small accession of fibres from this bone. This fleshy slip may be brought into view by turning the upper margin of the muscle out^- wards. The origin of the latissimus dorsi from the lumbar spines is effected through the medium of the superficial or posterior lamina of the lumbar apon- eurosis, a dense tendinous membrane which covers the erector spinae muscle in the loins. Clean this thoroughly. The attachment of the muscle to the crest of the ilium and its three digitations from the three last ribs must be carefully defined. You will now notice that a triangular space is mapped out by the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and the base of the scapula. Within these limits a small portion of the rhomboideus major muscle will be seen,

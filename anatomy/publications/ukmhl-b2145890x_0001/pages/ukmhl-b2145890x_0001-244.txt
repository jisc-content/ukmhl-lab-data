20 ABDOMEN. the ascending ramus of the ischium close to the tuber- osity. It passes inwards and unites with the corre- sponding muscle of the opposite side in the central % point of the perineum. From this blending of the two muscles in the middle line it has occurred to some anatomists to describe them as together forming one digastric muscle, and certainly this mode of description is calculated to give a better idea of their action. By their simultaneous contraction they steady the central point of the perineum, and give support to the anus during defsecation. T/ie central point of the perineum.—But what is this central point of the perineum ? It is a tendinous point situated in the middle line of the body midway between the anus and the bulb. Towards this point, a number of the perineal muscles converge to obtain attachment. On each side it gives attachment to the transverse perineal muscles, behind to the sphincter ani, in front to the posterior fibres of the accelerator urinae, whilst from above the anterior fibres of the levator ani descend •40 reach its upper aspect. Accelerator urince, or bidbo-cavernosus.—This muscle is spread over the bulb and posterior part of the corpus spongiosum. It is composed of two symmetrical halves, and its fibres take origin from the central point of the perineum and from a fibrous median raphe which is prolonged forwards between the two halves of the muscle. The insertion differs according to the point at which the muscle is examined. The posterior fibres are simply attached to the superficial aspect of the anterior triangular ligament; the middle fibres

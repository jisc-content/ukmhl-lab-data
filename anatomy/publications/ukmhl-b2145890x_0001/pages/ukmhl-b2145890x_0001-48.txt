UPPER LIMB. middle, and the radial side of the ring fingers. In .many cases its area of supply stops short at the radia side of the middle finger, in which case an add.t.onal branch from the ulnar is given for the supply of the ulnar side of the medius and the radial side of the rmg Upon the inner aspect of the forearm the dis- sector must dissect out the anterior and posterior branches of the internal ctitamous and the dorsal branch of the ulnar The latter emerges from under cover of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnans, and will be found passing downwards over the dorsal aspect of the wrist close to the outer side of the styloid process of the ulna. It ends by giving dorsal di-ital twigs to the minimus and to the ulnar margn, of "the ring finger. It likewise sends a commumcatmg branch to the radial nerve on the back of the hand To trace the digital nerves from the ulnar and radial in their course along the fingers, the skin must be reflected from each finger by a vertical incision along its middle. In the/r^Â«^ of the forearm a s^^A palmar cutaneous twig from the ulnar nerve will be found piercing the deep fascia to the outer side of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and about three inches above the wrist A small palmar cutaneous nerve from the medtan must also be sought for in the middle line of the limb about two inches above the wrist. Deep Fascia-The fascia enveloping the forearm should now be cleaned by removing the subcutaneous

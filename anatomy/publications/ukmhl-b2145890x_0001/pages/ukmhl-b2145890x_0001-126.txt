114 LOWER LIMB. they will be seen to be lined by synovial membrane. Lastly, note the position of the anterior tibial vessels and nerve as they pass under cover of the ligament. They lie between the extensor longus hallucis and the extensor longus digitorum. PERONEAL REGION. In this region are comprised :— (i.) The peronei muscles. (2.) The external popliteal nerve. (3.) The musculo-cutaneous nerve. Peronei Muscles.—The peroneus longus and brevis lie upon the outer aspect of the fibula, and their . tendons should be followed downwards under cover of the external annular ligament to the outer margin of the foot. The insertion of the peroneus brevis into the projection of the base of the fifth metatarsal can now be made out, but the tendon of the peroneus longus disappears by passing into the sole in the groove on the under surface of the cuboid bone. Note the rela- tion which these two tendons have to each other as. they lie behind the outer malleolus. The peroneus longus lies upon the peroneus brevis, and both are enveloped by a synovial membrane. External Popliteal Nerve—Musculo - Cutane- ous Nerve.—The external popliteal nerve has already been traced as far as the neck of the fibula. The student will now see that it disappears from view at this point by passing between the peroneus longus and the bone. This muscle must therefore be carefully

FEMALE PELVIS. the mucous lining of the uterus in the triangular cavity of the body and in the fusiform cavity of the cervix. In the former it is smooth and even, and tightly bound down to the subjacent muscular tissue. In the cervix it presents a remarkable disposition, which, from its appearance, has been termed the arbor vitce. This con- sists of a series of prominent folds or rugae arranged in a definite manner. Thus there is an anterior and posterior median fold or raphe, and from this secondary folds branch off and pass obliquely upwards and out- wards. The arbor vitae is more marked upon the anterior than upon the posterior wall. The student should look between the folds of the arbor vitae for ovula Nabothi. These are minute vesi- cles filled with a yellowish liquid. At one time they were thought to be ova, whereas they are merely folli- cles distended with fluid. Fallopian Tubes.—The Fallopian tubes should be opened towards their expanded ovarian extremities, and a probe introduced. It will be found, however, that the canal is too narrow to admit this into the uterus; indeed, the uterine aperture of the tube will barely allow the passage of a bristle. The ovarian orifice of the tube is also much constricted. To obtain a proper idea of the fimbriae which surround this opening, the tube should be immersed in water, when the fringes will float out and separate from each other. Mucous Membrane of the Vagina.—The mucous lining of the vagina should now be examined. It will be observed to present special peculiarities. Two well-

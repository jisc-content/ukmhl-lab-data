GLUTEAL REGION. 63 Sciatic Nerves and Vessels.—In cleaning the ^ great sciatic wQrvQ be careful not to remove a minute artery—the comes nervi ischiadici—which enters its substance and passes downwards amidst its fibres. The small sciatic nerve should also be more fully dissected out. The branches which it gives to the gluteus .►maximus and to the skin over the gluteus maximus liave been divided. A few cutaneous twigs to the skin on the inner aspect of the thigh and its lojtg pudendal branch must now be found. In a well-injected body the anastomosis between the sciatic artery and the internal circumflex as it appears between the contiguous borders of the adduc- tor magnus and quadratus femoris may be made out. Of the three named branches which proceed from the small sciatic artery two have been already observed—viz., the coccygeal and the comes nervi ischiadici; the third, the artery to the quadratus femoris, accompanies the nerve to that muscle, and will be found lying close beside it. Pudic Vessels and Nerves, and the Nerve to i the Obturator Internus.—These will be found upon j the spine of the ischium under cover of the great ' sciatic ligament, and a careful dissector can readily trace a delicate twig to the gemellus superior from the nerve to the obturator internus. ' The Nerve to the Quadratus Femoris lies under cover of the great sciatic nerve. Consequently, the first step to its discovery consists in drawing aside this large nervous trunk. It passes downwards and

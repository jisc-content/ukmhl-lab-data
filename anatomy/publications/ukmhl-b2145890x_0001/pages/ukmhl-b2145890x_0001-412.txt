ABDOMEN. The fossa for the gall-bladder, parallel to the umbilical fissure, extends upon the under surface of the right lobe from the anterior border to a point near the right extremity of the transverse fissure. The fissure for the vena cava begins a little way behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure, and extends obliquely backwards and to the left to the posterior border of the organ, where it ends close to the fissure for the ductus venosus. Not unfre- quently this fissure, like the umbilical fissure, is con- verted into a canal by a bridge of hepatic substance. The hepatic fissures, therefore, with the exception of the longitudinal, which lies between the two primary lobes, are entirely confined to the under surface of the right lobe, and upon this they mark off three sub- sidiary lobes, viz.:â€” (i.) The lobulus quadratus. (2.) The lobulus Spigelii. (3.) The lobulus candatus. The lobulus quadratus, quadrilateral in form, is bounded behind by the transverse fissure, to the right by the fossa for the gall-bladder, and to the left by the umbilical fissure. The lobulus Spigelii is a prominent and irregular portion of liver substance, which projects from the back part of the right lobe behind the transverse fissure. To the left it is limited by the fissure for the ductus venosus; to the right by the fissure for the vena cava. The lobulus candatus is a slight ridge of liver sub-

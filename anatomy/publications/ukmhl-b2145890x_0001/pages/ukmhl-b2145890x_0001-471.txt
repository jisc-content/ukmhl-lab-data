The fascia is not deficient at the bottom of this furrow. It is prolonged from one side to the other over the dorsal vein, so as to hide it from view.

The parietal pelvic fascia (posterior layer of the triangular ligament), as we have seen, sweeps backwards round the anterior margin of the levator ani (Fig. 42, p. 241). It now blends with the recto-vesical layer, and closes the prostatic capsule in front, whilst at a lower level it is joined by the rectal layer.

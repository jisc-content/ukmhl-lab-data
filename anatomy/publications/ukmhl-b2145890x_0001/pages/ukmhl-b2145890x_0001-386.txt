x60 ABDOMEN. transverse slit guarded by a valve which consists of an upper and lower crescentic segment or fold of mucous membrane. At the extremities of the aperture these folds unite and are prolonged round the inner surface of the wall of the great intestine in the form of two ridges which are termed the frcEna or retinacula of the valve. The function of this valve is very obvious. It is so arranged that the free passage of materials from the ileum into the coecum is in no way impeded, but when the coecum becomes distended and there is consequently a tendency to regurgitation, the fr^na of the valve are put upon the stretch, and the free borders of the segments brought into firm contact. In this way reflux of the contents of the coecum into the ileum is effectually prevented. The Ooeliac Axis, the artery which supplies blood to the stomach, duodenum, spleen, and pancreas, should now be dissected. Pull the stomach down- wards and tear through the two layers of peritoneum which form the gastro-hepatic omentum. The artery will be found by dividing the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon along the upper border of the pancreas. This dissection will be facilitated if the liver is first raised and then fixed in this position, by stitching it to the lower margin of the thorax. The cceliac axis is a short wide vessel, which springs from the front of the aorta, between the two crura of the diaphragm, opposite the lower border of the body of the last dorsal vertebra, and in immediate relation to the upper margin of the pancreas. It is directed horizontally forwards, and after a course of little more than half-an-inch divides into three large

54 ABDOMEN. (io.) The superior epigastric and musculo-phrenic arteries, (ii.) The spermatic cord, (i 2.) The inguinal canal. (13.) The extra-peritoneal fat. (14.) The parietal peritoneum. Reflection of Skin.——(I.) Along the middle line of the body from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. At the navel the knife should be carried round so as to surround it with a circular in- cision. (2.) From the ensiform cartilage transversely outwards around the chest, as far back as the knife can be carried. (3.) From the symphysis pubis out- wards along the line of Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and then back- wards along the crest of the ilium (Pis. I. and III.) The large flap thus mapped out should be carefully raised from the subjacent superficial fascia and turned outwards. If the abdominal wall is flaccid, the dissec- tion may be facilitated by inflating the abdomen. Make an incision through the umbilicus large enough to admit the nozzle of the bellows, and, when the walls are quite tense, secure the opening with twine, which has previously been sewed round the lips of the incision. The Superficial Fascia.—The superficial fascia which is now laid bare is seen to present the same appearance, and possess the same characters as in other localities. Above it is thin and weak, and is directly continuous with the corresponding fascia over

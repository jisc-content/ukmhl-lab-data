ABDOMEN. tends across the foramen ; and (3.) from the surface of Coccygeal Body.—This is a minute lobulated body about the size of a small pea, and situated in front of the tip of the coccyx. In structure it is partly vascular and partly nervous, and it is formed in connection with the terminal twigs of the middle sacral artery. It receives minute filaments from the ganglion impar. Removal of the Viscera.—The viscera must now be removed from the pelvic cavity. Begin by dividing the vessels and nerves which enter them, the levator\ni, and the anterior true ligaments of the bladder. Then sever the parts which hold the mem- branous portion of the urethra and the bulb of the penis to the pubic arch. Great care must be taken at this stage not to injure the delicate walls of the urethra, or to lose sight of Cowper's glands. Lastly, separate the rectum from its connections with the coccyx. Laying aside the viscera for a little, the dissector should study the muscles in relation to the pelvic wall—viz., the obturator internus and the pyriformis. Obturator Internus.—This muscle clothes the lateral wall of the pelvis upon its inner aspect. Remove the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, and it will come into view. It is a fan-shaped muscle, and has an extensive origin, viz.—(i.) from the entire circumference of the thyroid foramen, except above, where the obturator vessels and nerve quit the pelvis; (2 ) from the deep surface of the membrane which ex-

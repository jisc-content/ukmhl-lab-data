lg2 ABDOMEN. In Studying the liver, it is necessary to recognise two borders, two extremities, and two surfaces, and to examine each separately. The borders stand out in marked contrast to each other. The anterior is thin, sharp, and free, whereas the posterior is thick, rounded, and attached. Note further, that the sharp anterior border presents two notches, one opposite the ninth costal cartilage for the fundus of the gall-bladder, the other, deeper and better marked, opposite the falciform ligament, m which is lodged the ligamentum teres. The rounded posterior border, on the other hand, is slightly depressed by the spinal column, and also to the right of this it is notched by the vena cava. This border has been seen to be attached to the diaphragm by the lateral and coronary ligaments (p. I43), by areolar tissue, and by the vena cava. The two extremities are also very different from each other. The right is thick and rounded, like the posterior border, whilst the left is thin and attenuated, like the anterior border. The superior surface is smooth and convex, and is moulded upon the under surface of the diaphragm In connection with this surface is the falciform or broad ligament, which marks the subdivision of the organ into two unequal parts-a large right lobe and a small left lobe The convexity of the upper surface of the liver is not by any means uniform. In the right lobe it is high and prominent, so as to fit into the right vault of the diaphragm; in the case of the left lobe, how- ever, the surface is very nearly even.

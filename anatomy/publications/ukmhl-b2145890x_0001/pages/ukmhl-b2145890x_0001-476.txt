250 ABDOMEN. portion of the bladder, however, is in direct apposition with the gut; externally to this, on each side, the vas deferens and the seminal vesicle intervene between them. The third part of the rectum, about one and a-half inches long, bends downwards and backwards to reach the anus. It is totally destitute of peritoneum, but upon each side it is clothed and supported by the rectal layer of the pelvic fascia and the levator ani muscle, whilst its orifice is embraced by the sphincter ani. The prostate is in relation to it anteriorly at its commencement—in fact, at the very point where it takes the bend. The membranous portion of the urethra and the bulb of the penis are also anterior to it, but owing to the backward inclination of the gut they are not in contact with it, but are separated from it by an angular interval. The staff, which has been introduced into the bladder, being held in the middle line, the student should pass the forefinger of the right hand into the rectum, and endeavour to distinguish by touch the parts in relation to the anterior aspect of the gut. Passing beyond the bulb, the staff, as it lies in the membranous part of the urethra, will be felt very distinctly; next, the pros- tate will be encountered; and, immediately behind this, the finger, provided it is carried upwards exactly in the middle line, will rest upon the small triangular surface of the base of the bladder, which is in contact with the rectum—the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia alone intervening. The Bladder.—This is a hollow, musculo-mem- branous viscus which acts as a temporary reservoir for the urine, before it is emitted from the body by the orocess of micturition. As will be readily under-

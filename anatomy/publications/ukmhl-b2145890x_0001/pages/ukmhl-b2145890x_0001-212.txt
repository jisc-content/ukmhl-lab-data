200 THORAX. the superior vena cava. It is situated in the posterior mediastinum, with the aorta lying to the left and the thoracic duct occupying the interval between them. The tributaries of the vena azygos major are as follows:—(I.) the intercostal veins of the ten lower spaces of the right side ; (2.) the vena azygos minor superior ; (3.) the vena azygos minor inferior ; (4.) the bronchial vein from the right lung; (5.) certain of the oesophageal veins. The vena azygos major communicates below with some of the lumbar veins—tributaries of the inferior vena cava; whilst above, it pours its blood into the superior vena cava. In this way it forms a link by which the superior vena cava is brought into connection with the inferior vena cava. Vena Azygos Minor Superior.—This vein is formed on the left side of the body by the union of the intercostal veins of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth spaces. It communicates above with the vein which carries the blood from the second and third intercostal spaces to the left innominate vein. At the level of the eighth dorsal vertebra, it turns inwards behind the aorta and thoracic duct, and crossing the middle line, it ends by joining the vena azygos major. The Vena Azygos Minor Inferior.—This vein takes origin within the abdomen from one of the lumbar veins of the left side. It enters the thorax by piercing the left crus of the diaphragm, and is con- tinued upwards upon the vertebral column as far as the ninth dorsal vertebra. At this point it turns to I

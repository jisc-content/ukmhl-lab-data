FEMALE PELVIS. 305 necessary, therefore, to mention here the points of difference in the female. The relations and extent of the first part are similar in every respect, with one exception—viz., that the peritoneal cul-de-sac in front separates it, not from the bladder, but from the uterus. The second part is also separated, for a short distance, by the recto-vaginal cul-de-sac from the uterus and vagina. Below this, however, it is in apposition with the posterior wall of the vagina—a layer of pelvic fascia (the recto-vaginal) alone inter- vening. The connection between the rectal and vaginal walls is at first very loose, but afterwards much more intimate. This has an important bearing upon the manner in which prolapsus uteri takes place. The third part, at the tip of the coccyx, bends downwards and backwards, so that an angular interval is left between the gut and the vagina—an interval to which the term perineum is restricted by the accoucheur. ^ The Bladder.-The female bladder when distended, is rounder and not so ovoid in shape as in the male. The base, which is directed backwards and slightly downwards, is in relation to the neck of the uterus and the vagina. For further particulars regarding this viscus, the student may refer to p. 250, where the male bladder is described. He must bear in mmd, however, that in the female there is no pro- state surrounding its neck, no vas deferens upon its PART II. ^

4 ABDOMEN. perineum is very limited ; indeed, when the Hmbs are extended and approximated, it merely consists of a narrow groove running forwards between the thighs from the coccyx towards the pubis. In this groove are placed the anus or orifice of the rectum and the roots of the scrotum and penis, whilst in the middle line a cutaneous ridge—the median raphe—m^y be observed. This raphe can be traced from the anus forwards over the scrotum and along the under surface of the penis. The perineal space, then, has a diamond-shaped form, and it is customary to subdivide it arbitrarily into two portions by drawing an imaginary transverse line between the anterior parts of the ischial tuber- osities and immediately in front of the anus. Two triangles are thus mapped out. The anterior of these may be appropriately called the urethral triangle,. because the most important object which it contams is the urethra ; the posterior may be distinguished as the rectal triangle, from its containing the lower end of the rectum. Reflection of Skin.—Two incisions are required:— (PI. II.) (i.) a transverse incision along the line which separates the rectal from the urethral triangle—in front of the tuberosities of the ischium ; (2.) an incision at right angles to this in the line of the median raphe. This incision should begin well forwards on the scrotum and be continued back a little beyond the point of the coccyx. At the anus the knife should be carried round it so as to encircle it.

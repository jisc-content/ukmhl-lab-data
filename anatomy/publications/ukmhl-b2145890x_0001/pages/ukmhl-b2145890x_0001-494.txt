268 ABDOMEN. they can be easily found by following downwards a twig from the fourth to the fifth sacral nerve, and another twig which connects the fifth nerve with the coccygeal. The first and second sacral nerves are very large and almost equal in size; the third sacral nerve is much smaller than these, and the fourth still smaller than the third. Each spinal nerve is joined by two twigs from the sympathetic cord. The first three sacral nerves unite to form the sacral plexus. This is joined above by the lumbosacral cord, and below by a branch from the fourth sacral nerve. The fifth sacral nerve and the coccygeal nerve, with the descending branch of the fourth sacral nerve, unite to form the sacro-coccygealplexus. Superior Gluteal Nerve.—This nerve springs from the lumbo-sacral cord before it enters the sacral plexus. It leaves the pelvis through the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen above the level of the pyriformis muscle and in company with the gluteal artery. Enter- ing the gluteal region, it supplies three muscles—viz., the gluteus medius, the gluteus minimus, and the tensor fasciae femoris. Sacral Plexus.—This differs in appearance from every other plexus in the body, as the nerves which enter it unite to form a single broad flattened band. This proceeds downwards and outwards to the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and here, much reduced in width and increased in thickness, it enters

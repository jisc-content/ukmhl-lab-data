THORAX. i88 in two sets—(I.) a few delicate twigs are given by the pneumogastric before it enters the pulmonaiy plexus to that portion of the oesophagus which lies in the superior mediastinum; (2.) numerous filaments are supplied by the plexus guise to that part of the oeso- phagus which is placed in the posterior mediastinum. CEsophagus.—The thoracic portion of the oeso- phagus should next be studied. It lies partly in the superior mediastinum and partly in the posterior mediastinum. It is the narrowest, but at the same time the most muscular, part of the alimentary canal. It descends in front of the spine, following its antero- posterior curvatures, and leaves the thoracic cavity opposite the ninth dorsal vertebra by passing through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm. The oesophagus does not pursue a straight course through the thorax. It enters somewhat to the left of the middle line, but on tracing it downwards, it will be noticed to incline inwards so as to assume a mesial position opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra. From this it again deviates to the left so as to gain the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm. From above downwards you will notice the following structures in contact with the oesophagus in front: (i.) the trachea; (2.) the left bronchus; (3.) pericardium. Behind, it rests from above down- wards : (i.) upon the longus colli muscle opposite the first two dorsal vertebrae ; (2.) upon the bodies of the vertebrae and the intercostal arteries ; (3.) upon the anterior aspect of the thoracic aorta. Upon the right side it is related to the right pleura and the vena azygos

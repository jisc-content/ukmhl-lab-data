ABDOMEN. be distinguished by the hard, firm, cord-Uke sensation which it gives when the spermatic cord is held between the finger and thumb. It ascends along the posterior part of the cord. At the internal abdommal ring, however, it separates from the spermatic vessels, and' lies to their inner side, and as it enters the abdomen it hooks round the deep epigastric artery. The artery to the vas deferens is a small branch from the superior vesical. It follows the duct to the testicle. The sympathetic filaments extend downwards upon the spermatic artery. They come from the renal and aortic plexuses. The spermatic lymphatics enter the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring, and join the lumbar glands. The Testicle.â€”The testicle should next be examined. First note its position in the scrotum. It lies somewhat obliquely, with its upper end directed forwards and outwards, and its lower end backwards and inwards. The left testicle hangs at a lower level than the right. The spermatic cord should now be dmded, and the testicle removed from the scrotum. When this is done it will be noticed that the organ has still another investment to be considered-viz., the tunica vaginalis. The tunica vaginalis is a serous sac, and conse- quently presents a parietal or scrotal-^ox\Aon, and a visceral or testicular portion. Its extent can be de- monstrated in a striking manner by makmg a small aperture in the parietal part, and then introducmg a

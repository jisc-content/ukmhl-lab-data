199 AZVGOS VEINS. On the left side of the body four modes of termina- tion may be recognised :— (i.) The intercostal vein of the first or highest space has the same termination as the corresponding vein of the right side. It joins the left irmominate vein (sometimes the vertebral vein of its own side). (2.) The intercostal veins of the second and third spaces (and sometimes of the fourth space) converge, and by their union form a single trunk which crosses the arch of the aorta and joins the left innominate vein independently of the superior intercostal vein. (3.) The intercostal veins of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth spaces terminate in the vena azygos minor superior. (4.) The intercostal veins of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh spaces join the vena azygos mi7ior inferior. The azygos veins which thus receive the blood of the great majority of the intercostal veins should now be studied. Vena Azygos Major.—This vein takes origin within the abdomen in some of the ascending branches of the right lumbar veins. It also frequently communi- cates with the right renal vein. It enters the thorax through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, lying upon the right side of the thoracic duct and the aorta^. In the thorax it extends upwards upon the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae and over the right intercostal arteries, until it reaches the level of the upper border of the root of the right lung. At this point it hooks forwards over the right bronchus, and ends by joining

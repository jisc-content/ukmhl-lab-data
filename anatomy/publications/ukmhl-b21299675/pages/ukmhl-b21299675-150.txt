[102 J ccsopljagus is always more or less narrow- ed, and in some cases is almost wholly ob- literated. It is worthy of remark, that these ulcers happen most frequently, either immediately under the pharynx, or near the cardia. Any substance capable of irritating the inner membrane of the oesophagus, by having sharp hard projections, will doubt- less be more likely to affect the oesophagus, where it first enters into it. In an oesopha- gus, therefore, predisj)osed to scirrhus, such an accident may prove an exciting cause, and the disease will more frequently take place at its upper end. At the cardia too, there Is a peculiar arrangement of the muscular fibres, which are capable of act- ing in some degree like a sphincter, and which probably produce on many occasions a narrowness of the canal there. This will render the oesophagus at the cardia more liable to be injured by the passage of any hard substance, and may ultimately lay the foundation of a scirrhous ulcer. This is the

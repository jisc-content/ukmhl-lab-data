C 119 ] rynx or the oesophagus. How this should happen it is very difficult to explain, but it has been observed by Dr. Robertson, the Physician of Greenwich Hospital. When ulcers have taken place in the ca- vity of the larynx, there is a fixed pain in the situation of this organ, difficulty of breathing, and the patient can only speak in a whisper. This state of the larynx is accompanied with more or less of symptQ- matic fever. The symptoms which attend catarrh are too generally known to require being men- tioned. When there is a sense of soreness in this disease, passing down the middle of the chest, it arises from a considerable in- flammation of the inner membrane of the trachea. This inflammation soon goes off", but the increased secretion from the glands of the trachea often remains for a good while afterwards.

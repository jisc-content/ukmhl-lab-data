The trachea I have seen narrowed in its diameter for two or three inches, thickened in its substance, and the inner membrane has been raised into a number of little hard tubercles. This state of the trachea was accompanied with a scirrhous affection of some absorbent glands, which closely ad- hered to it; and it appeared to me that the disease in the glands had spread, so as to affect the trachea.

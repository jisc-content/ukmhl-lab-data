[ 274 ] a young man, a little beyond the age of twenty. He did not conriplain of any fixed pain in the situation of the pancreas, but had a good deal of pain in different parts of the abdomen. This seemed to be con- nected with spasmodic contractions of the intestinal canal, which inclosed portions of wind, and also with spasms of the abdomi- iial muscles. There was sickness and dis- tension of the stomach more especially after eating, and the food likewise sometimes occasioned a sense of weight in that organ. He had a disposition to purging; made but little water; and became at length dropsical. His pulse was commonly about eighty.* In some cases which are related in books, I find that patients with abscesses in the pancreas have commonly complained of pain in the back and loins, but they seem to have had no peculiar symptoms. * For the account of the symptoms in the above case, I am indebted to Dr. Wm. Heberden.

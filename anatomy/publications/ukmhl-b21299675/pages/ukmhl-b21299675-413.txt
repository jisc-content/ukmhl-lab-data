[ 365 ] accumulated in the cells of the cellular membrane, which envelopes the vessels of the spermatic chord. The cellular mem- brane of this part of the body is in consi- derable quantity, and when water is accu- mulated in its cells, a large swelling is formed in the situation of the spermatic chord, which is readily diminished upon pressure. When pressure is used, the swelling is diminished, not only by a part of the water being forced into the cells of the chord within the abdominal ring, but also by its being forced into the cellular membrane under the skin of the lower part of the belly. Many pints have been known to be accumulated in these cells. It has never occurred to myself to see this disease, and therefore I have had no opportunity of examining the nature of the fluid; but I presume it is of the same sort with what is usually found in anasarca.

The scirrhus sometimes extends over a considerable length of the gut, viz. several inches; but generally it is more circum- scribed. It exhibits the same appearances of structure which were described when speaking of scirrhus of the stomach. The peritonjeal, muscular, and internal coats are much thicker and harder than in a na^ tural state. The muscular too is subdivided by membranous septa, and the internal coat is sometimes formed into hard irregu- lar folds. It often happens that the surface of the inner membrane is ulcerated, pro- ducing cancer. Every vestige of the natural structure is occasionally lost, and the gut appears changed into a gristly substance. When scirrhus affects the gut, the passage N

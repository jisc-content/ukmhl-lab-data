They arc at first very small, being not larger than the heads of very small pins, and in this case are fre- quently accumulated in small clusters; The smaller tubercles of a cluster probably grow together, and form one larger tuber- cle. The most ordinary size of tubercles is about that of a garden pea, but they are subject in this respect to much variety.

I 41 J ductus arteriosus. Life must, therefore have been supported for a very coiisicierable length of time with hardly any florid blood distributed over the body. I regret ex- tremely that I have only been able to collect a very imperfect account of the child when alive. The child had a most unusually livid skin, which arose from the very small proportion of the florid blood in the general circulation. The surface of the child's body felt colder than that of a child pro- perly formed and in good health; the res- piration was na;ural. When any similar malformation shall occur, it could be wished that the heat of the surface of the body, and of the internal parts, were mea- sured accurately by a thermometer. The heat of the internal parts will be most con- veniently measured by putting a small, thermometer into the rectum.* * This very singular malformation of the heart was given lo nie by Dr. Wullaslon, of St. Edmundsbury, who look much trouble in endeavouring to collecL inl'or- niation about the child, but wilhouL tiie desired success.

[ 363 ] Diseased Appearafices of the Spermatic Chord. Spermatic Chord scirrhous. The spermatic chord is also liable to dis- eased alterations of structure: one of the most common is that of its becoming scir- rhous. This I believe to be very rarely, if at all, an original disease of the chord, but always, or almost always, spreads to it from the testicle. In the early state of a scirrhous testicle the spermatic chord is perfectly sound; but when the disease has existed for a considerable time, and does not remain stationary, the chord becomes at length affected. Under such circum- stances it is changed into a hard mass, ex- hibiting the same appearance of structure as the testicle itself. During the last stage the disease advances to the loins, so as to affect the absorbent glands there.

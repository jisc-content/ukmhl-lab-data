The most usual situation of a rup- ture in the female is known also to be either under Paupart's ligament, or at the navel. The reason of the frequency of the first si- tuation, is the particular shape of the pelvis in the female, by which there is a larger empty space under Paupart's ligament, than in the male, so that the viscera in that part are less firmly supported. The reason why the second situation of a rupture oc- curs often in the female, is, probably, fre- quent child-bearing. During pregnancy, at its advanced period, the navel opens, or trives way, and where pregnancies have been frequent, it probably never recovers its original strength.

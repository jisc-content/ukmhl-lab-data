[318] is generally formed in to one or more circum- scribed masses, yet it sometimes happens that the whole bladder is hlled with a sub- stance like mortar. OF this I recollect one striking example; the earthy matter in this case could not be entirely removed from the bladder, but a great many small irre- gular portions still adhered to the sides of its cavity. I believe that this matter was of the same nature with the common cal- culus, because it exhibited the same affini- ties with the common acids. Within the last three years 1 have met with another instance in which the matter of calculus put on the appearance and consistence of mortar, but was in small quantity. It was connected with a chronic inflammation of the inner membrane of the bladder, and processes of coagulable lymph attached to the inner membrane were encrusted with the calculous matter. This disease had continued for many years, and was com- bined with stricture of the urethra.

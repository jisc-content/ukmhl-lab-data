The ovaria are then en- larged, are harder than in a natural state, and are highly vascular; very commonly pus is found to have been formed. Scirrhus of the Ovaria. Scirrhus is a disease which sometimes attacks the ovaria, although seldom in com- parison of its attacking the uterus. Under such circumstances the ovaria become en- larged, and are converted into a whitish hard mass, which is more or less inter- sected with membranous septa. These scirrhous masses have sometimes a dispo- sition to be converted into bone; and in this way most frequently, I believe, the ovaria become bony. The bony substance into which they are converted has sometimes a greater admixture of earth than the natural bones of the body.

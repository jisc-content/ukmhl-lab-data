This inflammation is produced by the gut being strongly pressed at the narrowest part of the sack, viz. at that part where the sack immediately passes out of the cavity of the abdomen. This inflam- mation exhibits the different appearances, upon dissection, which we have so often related. The gut too, is frequently found mortified : this is shewn by its dark colour, by its want of proper tenacity, and by the air which is formed within it. When the inflammation of the gut in a sack has not been very violent, and has terminated by resolution, it frequently leaves adhesions behind it, connecting the gut with the inner surface of the sack. It is perhaps possible too, that adhesions may be formed by long close contact, without inflammation. When the sack of a rupture has not been of Jong standing, it consists of a thin, firm, white, opaque, membrane; this is a pro- 1

The cranium is exceedingly large in proportion to thfe size of the face, llie projections are very considerable at the centres of ossification, from whence the frontal, parietal, and oc- cipital bones were originally formed, and the membranous divisions between these several bones are very wide. When the ^calp is removed, so as to give an oppor- tunity of looking immediately upon the cranium, the bones are found to be very "thin, often not thicker fhan a shilling, and "there are frequently broad spots of mem- bi'ane in the bone. The reason of this last appearance is, that ossification takes place "in tnany points of the membrane in sUcIi cases in order to make a quicker progress, - but the water accumulates too rapidly for ' it, so that spots of membrane are left not converted into bone. When such appear- ances take place in hydrocephalus, the

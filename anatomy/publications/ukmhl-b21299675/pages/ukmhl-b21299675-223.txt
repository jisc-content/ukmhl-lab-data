Baron Haller had also observed, that in infants a portion of intestine sometimes falls down into this bag after the testicle, or along with it, produc- ing what he called the hernia congenita. The commiuiication between the bag and the abdomen is commonly closed, some- times a little before, and sometimes soon after birth.

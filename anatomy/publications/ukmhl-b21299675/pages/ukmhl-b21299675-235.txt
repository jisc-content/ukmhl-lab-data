[ IS? ] fissure, situaled on the under surface of a small rounded head. Upon the under sur- face too o!" this worm there is a large semi- lunar fold of skin, into which the head retreats, or out of which it is elongated, which is entirely wanting in the lumbricus. teres. The anus of the lumbricus teres opens upon the under surface of the worm, a little way from its posterior extremity, by a transverse curved fissure; the anus of the earth worm opens by an oval aper- ture at the very extremity of the worm. The outer covering or skin in the lumbricus teres is less fleshy, and less strongly marked by transverse rugae, than in the earth worm. In the latter there is often to be seen a broad yellowish band, surrounding the body of the worm; but in the lumbricus teres, this is entirely wanting. On each side of the lumbricus teres there is a longi- tudinal line very well marked; in the earth worm there are three longitudinal lines upon the upper half of its surface, but these are so faintly marked, as to be hardly ob-

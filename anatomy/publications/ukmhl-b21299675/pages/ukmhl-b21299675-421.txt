[ 373 ] Scirrhous Enlargement of the Uterus- It sometimes happens, although not very often, that the uterus enlarges in its size, and becomes much harder than in its na- tural state. This change corresponds very much to that of scirrhus in other parts of the body, and commonly extends over the whole of the uterus. It is difficult to say to what size the uterus may at length arrive, in the progress of this disease, but I have seen it, in one case, as large as the gravid uterus at the sixth month. If a transverse section be made of the uterus in this state, it is found to consist of a hard substance, intersected by pretty thick membranes. Ulceration is sometimes discovered upon its inner surface, but I believe it is generally wanting. Tubercles are occasionally form- ed in this state of the uterus, being, as it were, imbedded in its substance, and they have a structure very much resembling that of the uterus itself"

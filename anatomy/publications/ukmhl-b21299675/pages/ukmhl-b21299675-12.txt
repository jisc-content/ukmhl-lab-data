IV PREFACE TO THE very much to be regretted that the know- ledge of morbid structure does not lead with certainty to the knowledge of morbid actions, although the one is the effect of the other; yet surely it lays the most solid foundation for prosecuting such inquiries with success. In proportion, therefore, as \We shall become acquainted with the changes produced in the structure of parts from diseased actions, we shall be more likely to make some progress towards a knowledge of the actions themselves, al- though it must be very slowly.

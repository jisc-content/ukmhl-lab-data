I 25 ] instance. The apex of the left ventricle was dilated into a pouch large enough to contain a small orange, was much thinner than in the healthy structure, and was lined with a thick white opaque membrane. There was hardly contained in it.any coa- gulated blood; but the quantity of the coagulated blood, in an aneurysm, depends commonly on the size of the bag. This disease most probably arose from the muscular structure at the apex of the ventricle having become weaker than in any other part, so that when the ventricle contracted upon the blood, it was pushed agaiijst the weakened part, which was not fully able to resist its impetus, and therefore was gradually dilated. Had the strength of the apex of the left ventricle been in due proportion to that of the other parts, it would seem impossible that the aneu- rysmal swelling should ever have taken place.

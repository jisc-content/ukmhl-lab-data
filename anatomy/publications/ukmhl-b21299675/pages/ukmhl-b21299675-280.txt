[ 235 ] Rupture of the Liver. The liver is more liable to be ruptured by external violence than any other gland of the body, which probably arises from two causes: the one is, that in thin persons the liver, more especially when large, lies near the surface of the body, and therefore may be readily affected by a strong external pressure. The other is, that the liver con- sists of a structure, the parts of which are more easily separated from each other by pressure, than those of almost any other organ or structure in the body. Thus, if the thumb or the finger be pressed against the liver with a good deal of force, the liver gives way much in the same manner as a rotten pear would do, although not so readily. In this trial the effect does not depend upon the liver being softened by putrefaction, because it will take place in the liver of a person immediately after death. It depends upon the peculiar structure of the liver, and therefore may

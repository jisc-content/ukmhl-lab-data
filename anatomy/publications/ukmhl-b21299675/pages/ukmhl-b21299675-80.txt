Semi-lunar Valves thick and opaque. It frequently happens that the semi-lunar valves are considerably thickened, and of an opaque white colour; in this case, the coats of the artery in the neighbourhood, I believe, are commonly thickened and diseased. Rupture of the Valves. There is a preparation in Dr. Hunter's collection, shewing one of the semi-lunar valves to have become thickened, and to have been ruptured to a considerable ex- tent. It is very rare that such an occur- rence happens, and in the present instance the rupture was so large, that I believe it must have proved almost immediately fatal.

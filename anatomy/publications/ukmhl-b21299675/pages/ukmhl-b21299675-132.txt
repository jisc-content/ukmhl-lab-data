[ 84 ] to those which attend inflamr^iation o/ t}|p lungs. I am inclined to believp tl^at this appearance of the lungs is produced by an extensive extravasation of coagulable lymph into their substance, during an at- tack of inflammation. When earthy concretions are formed in the lungs, persons are more or less subject to dilEculty of breathing, and a cough. Oc- casionally some of these concretions are coughed up, which circumstance becomes the discriminating mark of this disease. Without it, this disease could not be dis- tinguished from several others which attack the chest. When hydatids are formed in the lungs, they produce a cough, difficulty of breath- ing, and some frequency of the pulse. Tiiey are occasionally forced up by a violent fit of coughing; and this circumstance only can discriminate the disease in the living body.

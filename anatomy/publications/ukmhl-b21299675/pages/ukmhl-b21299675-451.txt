[ 403 ] but its formation as far as it goes is com- monly perfect. When this happens, all vestige of the ovarium is lost, and instead of it there is a bag of some firmness con- contained two small molar horse-teelh, and one incisor tooth, with a portion of bone attached to this tooth resembling the jaw. The remainder of the tumour was ccfmposed of about-two thirds of fat and one-third of hair of a black colour contained in a separate cyst. The molar teeth, which were fortunately divided by the saw longitudinally near the centre, had the same arrange- ment of enamel and bony matter as natural horse's teeth. Two very small blood vessels were observed going from the neck of the tumour into its substance, but they were not attended to, till the section had been made. As the history of the animal from its birth could not be procured, it cannot be ascertained whether both tes- ticles had previously been removed. It is possible that one testicle might have remained in the abdomen, and the form, situation, and size of the tumour, rather favour this supposition. But whether blood vessels were formed from the neighbouring parts to produce this pecuHar organization, or whether the teeth and hair were pro- duced by the spermatic vessels, the process is equally curious and inexplicable. This phoenrimenon, however, fully establishes the opinion of Dr. Baillie, that whea teeth and hair and fat are found in the ovaria, impreg- nation is not necessary to their formation, aud therefore it is highly probable, that in no instance it has been the cause of these extraordinary productions in the ovaria."

[ 73 ] and advancing towards suppuration. It seems to he the same matter with that of the tubercle, but ouly diffused unirornily over a considerable portion of the lungs, while the tubercle is circumscribed. Soft pulpy Tubercle. I have seen another sort of tu!)ercle in the lungs, which I l^elieve to be very rai^. It consists of a soft tumour, formed of a light brown, smooth substance. This is not contained in any proper capsule, but adheres immediately to the common struc- ture of the lungs. In cutting through se- veral of these tumours 1 did not find any of them in a state of suppuration. They were commonly as large as a gooseberry, and were chitfly placed upon the surface of the lungs; some, however, were scat- tered through their substance, of a sn)aller size. These arc very different in their appearance from the common tubercle last described.

It is natural to think that such nuclei are more common in the calculi found in the bladder of women than of men, because their urethra is wider and shorter, so that an extraneous bodv can be much more easily introduced into their bladder. The calculi of the bladder either lie loose in it, or are confined to some fixed situation from particular circumstances. When they are of a small size, they are sometimes lodged in pouches, or sacculi, formed by the protrusion of the inner mem- brane of the bladder between the fasciculi of its muscular fibres. A calculus also is oc- casionally attached to an excrescence of the bladder, so as to be kept in a fixed situation. There is frequently one calculus only in the bladder at a time, and then it is usually of an oval form ; but there are often more, and the calculi by rubbing upon each other ij;^ a narrow space acquire flat sides and angles. Calculi have sometimes a smooth uniform surface, but most frequently the

[ 42 ] Heart enlarged. The heart is sometimes found very much enlarged in its size, but without any appa- rent disease in its structure. The muscular parietes are generally as thin and sometimes even thinner than in a heart of the common size. Its cavities are filled with blood, partly fluid, and partly concreted into a loose coagulum. Hydatids adhering to the Heart. Hydatids* have occasionally been found adhering to the heart; but I have not met myself with any instances of this sort. They do not appear to be of the same kind in every part of the body; but their nature will be explained particularly, when I come to describe the diseased appearances of the liver and kidneys * See Morgagni, Epist. XXV. Art. 15.

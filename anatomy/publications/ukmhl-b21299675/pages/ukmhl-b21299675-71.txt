L 23 ] tliat polypi are commonly formed during life. When polypi are formed, I believe that the coagulation of the blood does not take place very quickly after death. They are without any admixture of the red glo- bules of blood, and therefore the blood has been sufficiently long in coagulalin<j^ to al- low the globules to separate from the other parts, in consequence of their greater spe- cific jjravitv* The ordinary coagulations of the blood, which commonly do not fill uj) very fully the cavities of the heart (although instances occasionally occur of this sort) take place pretty soon after death, because the red * In some instances, a coagulum of blood has been found, of a laminated texture, in such parts of the heart as are most remote from the direct current of the circulation. This laminated texture shews that the coagulation had taken place during life, and in a gra- dual manner. Two cases of this kind have been ob- served by Mr. Brodie, who, although young, is already well known to the public, as an excellent anatomist and physiologist. Such cases, however, are to be considered as different from the coagulations, which have been generally called polypi, and which fill up entirely one or more of the large cavities of the heart.

It is rare that infliimmalion of the gall- bladder advances to ulceration: llie accu- mulation of gall-stones in it, as far as I have observed, rarely produces this effect.* * I have myself only seen one instance of inflam- mation and ulceration of the gall-bladder produced by gall-stones. Dr. Soemnierring, however, has seen a good many instances of ulcers in the inner surface of the gall-bladder, from liie irritation of gall-stones.

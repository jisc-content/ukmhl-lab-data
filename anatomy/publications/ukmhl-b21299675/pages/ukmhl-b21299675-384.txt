A prostate gland, therefore, is never found enlarged to any considerable degree, without the bladder having undergone this change in its muscular coat.

This disease has little or no disposi- tion to run into ulceration, and it is capable of subsid- ing, which would not be the case if it was a true scir- rhus.

It is there- fore probable, that the hydatids which are commonly found in the kidney, depend on a diseased alteration of the structure of this organ, and are not distinct organized simple animals. Sometimes, however, the true hydatid is formed in the kidneys, having exactly the same nature with that which grows in the liver.

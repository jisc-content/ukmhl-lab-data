The lumbricus teres lias nothing . corresponding to feet; whereas the earth worm has on its under surface, but more strongly marked towards it posterior ex- tremity, a quadruple row of processes on ; 6ach side, very sensible both to the eye, and the finger, which manifestly serve the purposes of feet in the locomotion of the animal. The internal structure of these two spe- cies of worms is also extremely different. In the lumbricus teres, there is an intes- tinal canal, nearly usiform and smooth in its appearance, which passes from one ex- tremity of the worm to the other. Near the head of this worm, the canal is nar- rower than it is any where else, and some- what distinct iti its limits: this may be considered as the oesophagus. In the earth worm, there is a large and complex sto- mach, consisting of two cavities; and the intestinal canal in the latter is likewise larger, and more formed into sacculi, than in the former.

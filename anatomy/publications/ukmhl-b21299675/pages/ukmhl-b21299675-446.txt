[ 39S ] sorts of fluid, a circumstance which one would not expect a priori. These cysts, I believe, have been occa- sionally confounded with hydatids, to which they bear some resemblance. They are however really very diflferent They have much firmer and less pulpy coats than hydatids; they contain a different kind of fluid, and they are differently connected among themselves. Hydatids either lie un- connected with each other, or a large hy- datid incloses a number of smaller ones; or smaller hydatids adhere to the coats of those which are larger. Cysts of the ova- rium adhere to each other laterally by pretty broad surfaces; do not inclose each other; and appear to have no power ana- logous to generation as hydatids have, by which smaller cysts are formed, that are attached to those of a larger size. It ap- pears not improbable, that these cysts are formed by a gradual enlargement of the small vesicles which make a part of the natural structure of the ovaria.

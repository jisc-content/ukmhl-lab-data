This may be easily explained by the cartilages of the larynx having lost their flexibility, and therefore being rendered incapable of those finer motions which it is reasonable to ima- gine must have considerable influence upon the voice. In the cases which I have had an opportunity of examining, the ligaments which join the cartilages together were natural in their structure; had they been changed into bone, all the motions of the larynx would have been lost. It would then have been useless as the chief histru- ment of voice; but what would be the exact effect of such a change upon various sounds transmitted through the trachea and the larynx, it is extremely difficult to deter- mine. In some instances where the carti- lages of the larynx have been converted into bone, there has occurred a total inabi- lity of swallowing, which destroyed the pa- tients. Upon examination after death, no disease was observable either in the pha-

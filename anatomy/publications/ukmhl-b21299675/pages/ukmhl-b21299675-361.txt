[513] surface is granulated. These granules are commonly placed very near each other over the whole surface of the calculus, giving it a certain degree of roughness. They are, however, occasionally gathered into clusters on particular parts of the sur- face of a calculus. These granules are some- times of a smaller, and sometimes of a larger size, and in different calculi are more or less elevated. Some calculi have an irregular porous structure upon the surface, instead of being granulated. Calculi when divided by the saw, or broken, exhibit most commonly a lami- nated structure. These laminae are dis- posed in concentric curves, and are applied together with more or less compactness: in some calculi the laminze adhere tosether very slightly. They differ in their thick- ness in different calculi: and the laminated structure sometimes pervades uniformly the whole mass of the calculus; while at? other limes different portions of it are in- terrupted by a coarse porous texture.

They are also sometimes smooth, and some- times a little roughened on their surface. Of the nature of urinary calculi we shall speak afterwards, when we come to ta^ce notice of the diseased appearances of the bladder. When a stone in the pelvis of the ureter has increased to a very consider- able size, it almost entirely prevents the urine from passing into the ureter.

Slridure at the Pylorus. The orifice of the stomach may be al- most, or perhaps entirely, shut up by a permanent contraction of its muscular fibres, either at the cardia or pylorus. This is likely, however, to occur oftenest at the pylorus, because the fibres at this end of the stomach are more circular in their direction, and possess a stronger con- tractile power. Less contraction too, at the pylorus, will produce an obstruction in the canal, than at the cardia. I have seen one instance of this contraction at the pylorus, which, even there, is a very rare disease. The contraction was so great as hardly to admit a common goose quill to

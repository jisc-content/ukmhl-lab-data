'^RST EDITION. Xl ing morbid appearances, which I can have recourse to at any time for examination. Being physician to a large hospital, and engaged in teaching anatomy, I have also very frequent opportunities of examining diseases in dead bodies. This work will therefore chiefly contain an account of the morbid appearances which I have seen my- self; but I shall also take advantage of what has been observed by others. It is intended to comprehend an account of the most common, as well as many of the very rare appearances of disease in the vital and more important parts of the human body. From the nature of this undertaking it is evident, that it must be progressive: some appearances of disease will be observed in future, with which we are at present totally unacquainted, and others which we know very little of now, will afterwards be known perfectly.

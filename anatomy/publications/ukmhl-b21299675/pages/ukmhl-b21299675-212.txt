When this is the case, the mortified part is of a dark livid colour, and has lost its tenacity ; it-is in this state very easily torn through, or the fingers will pass through it as through a rotten pear. The want of the natural tenacity, when attended with the change of colour which we have mentioned, is the only sure criterion of a part being mortified, in examinations after death. A portion of intestine may be of a very dark colour, and yet may not be mortified.

Thus, wc see blood effused into the cellular membrane under the skin, producing a very dark appearance, yet the parts are quite alive. It has often happened too, that a very dark portion of intestine

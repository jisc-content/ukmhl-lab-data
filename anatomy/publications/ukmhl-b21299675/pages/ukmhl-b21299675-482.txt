The falciform process has been said to be occasionally found almost entirely converted into hone; but this last appear- ance is very rare. Very strong Adhesion oj the Dura Mater to the Cranium. There is at all times a strong adhesion between the dura mater and the inside of the cranium. This adhesion is principally formed by small blood vessels which pass from the one to the other, and likewise by a close application of the fibrous structure of the membrane to the bone, hi a natural state, however, the dura mater can be per- fectly separated from the cranium; yet it sometimes happens that the adhesion is so strong,"as to render it impossible to separate the two completely. The dura mater in such an attempt is torn in different parts

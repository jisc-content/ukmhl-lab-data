[ S49 ] but under it, where the fraenum is natu- rally situated; and in such cases there is no fraenum. It consists of a small rounded opening, much less than the natural ter- mination in the glans. I have known an instance in this structure of parts, of a canal being formed besides the urethra, about two inches in length, which termi- nated at one extremity in a cul-de-sac, and at the other opened on the glans, where the urethra commonly does. How far this variety may be frequent, I cannot pretend to determine. This deviation in the struc- ture is not to be considered as a disease, but simply as a malformation of parts, and is not attended with any material inconve- nience, as far as I know. There are some other diseased appear- ances of the penis, such as ulcers, phy- moses, paraphymoses, kc. These are ex- ternal, are very well known, and do not properly fall within my plan; I shall therefore omit them entirely.

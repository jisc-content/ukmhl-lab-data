[ 3^2 ] ment. As the anterior part of the bladder, which has no peritoniEal covering, pro- trudes first, the hernia is not contained in a hernial sack. If the hernia is large, the bladder drags down a portion of perito- naeum, forming a true hernial sack above it, but still the bladder is on the ouiside of the sack.* SYMPTOMS. In inflammation of the bladder, a pain is felt in the perinaeum, or above the piibes, accompanied with a fulness, or a swelling there. There are frequent at- tempts to make water, which is evacuated in small quantity and with great pain; or there is,a total retention of the urine, with a strong desire to void it. The rectum is aflected from its connection with the blad- der, and is exciied to tenesmus. The sto- mach likewise takes a part in the disease, being affected with sickness and vomiting. * See Pott on J?uptures, p. 0,2,6,

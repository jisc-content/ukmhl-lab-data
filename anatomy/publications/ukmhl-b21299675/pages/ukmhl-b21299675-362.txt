They are most frequently of a brown colour, which is sometimes of a lighter, and sometimes of a darker shade- They are also sometimes of a white, and often of a yellowish colour. It is remarkable, that different portions of the same calculus are frequently of a different colour. Some laminae, for instance, are ])erfectly white, while the other laminae are brown. In this sort of mixture, I have most commonly found the while laminae on the oulside, and the brown laminae in the middle; and I do not recollect seeing one instance of laminae of different colours, disposed in alternate strata. The specific gravity of urinary calculi differs very considerably, as they differ a good deal in their compactness; but they are in general nearly twice the specific gra- vity of water. It is only within a few years that the

CHAP. II. dist;ased appearances of the heart. Injlammalion of the Heart. In'plammation of the substance of the heart is a rare disease, and is most com- monly connected with an inflammation of the pericardium. When the pericardium covering its surface is inflamed, the inflam- mation sometimes passes a little way into the substance of the heart. That part of it becomes much more crowded with small vessels tlian in its natural state, and there are sometimes to be seen in it a few spots of extravasated blood. The substance of the heart may however be inflamed, without inflammation of the pericardium. I recol- lect an instance of this sort, where no marks of inflammation could be observed in that membrane, but where there was a little more water than usual in its cavity.

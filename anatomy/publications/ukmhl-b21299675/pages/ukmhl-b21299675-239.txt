[ 191 ] The head of this taenia is somewhat of a square form, with a narrowed projection forwards; in the middle of this projecting part, there is a distinct circular aperture, around the edge of which grow curved sharp processes. Near the angles of the squaie edge of the liead, are situated four round projecting apertures, at equal dis- tances from each other: this head is placed upon a narrow jointed portion of the worm, ofc(msiderable lenoth, and which ";raduallv spreads itself into the broader joints, of which the body of the worm is composed. The bodv of the taenia consists of thin, flat, pretty long joints, on one edge of which there is a projection, with a very obvious aperture. In the same worm some of these joints appear considerably longer than others, which probably depends on one joint being contracted, while another is relaxed.. The apertures which we have jusi ifcniioued are generally placed on the opposiie ' ^ of the contiguous joints; but this is not uuiibrmly the case;.they are

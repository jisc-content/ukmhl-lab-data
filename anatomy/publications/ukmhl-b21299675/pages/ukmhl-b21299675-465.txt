[ ] Inversion of the Vagina, One of the most common diseases of the vagina is its inversion, or prolapsus: this is more apt to happen where the natural for- mation of the pelvis is large, where the external opening at-the vulva is wide, and where the parts are generally relaxed. The prolapsus is more or less in different cases; in some the uterus does not pass out at the external parts, and in others the inversion of the vagina is complete, at the extremity of which is situated the os uteri. The pro- 'trusion has then different shapes; it some- times forms a large rounded mass, and sometimes it is narrower and more elon- gated, extending, perhaps, five inches from the surface of the body.

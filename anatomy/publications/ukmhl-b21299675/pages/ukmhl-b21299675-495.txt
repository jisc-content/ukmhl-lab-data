C ] cranium there is always some irregularity; This consists in numerous ridges and small eminences with depressed surfaces interrfi'^ posed between them. It happens occasion- ally that there is a morbid growth of these eminences and ridges, forming sharp spi- cula and sharp edges of bone. These run into the brain, and irritate very violently the nervous system. Hydrocephalus, One of the most common appearances of disease in the brain, is the accumulation of water in its ventricles ;* this generally takes place when a child is very young, and even sometimes before birth. The water is ac- cumulated in greater or less quantity in different cases. It sometimes amounts only â€¢Mr. H ome has known an instance where water was accumulated in large quantity in the third ventricle, and had forced its way between the fine laininas of the. medullary substance which compose the septum luci- duni, without escaping into either of the lateral ven- tricles. This may be said to be a new situation of hydrocephalus, and is of very rare occurrence.

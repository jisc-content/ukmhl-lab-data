[ 180] Thickened Folds of the Inner Membrane of the great Intestines. I have also seen the internal membrane of the great intestines formed into broad thick folds, in which a considerable quan- tity of blood was accumulated; these folds were perfectly independent of the state of the contraction in the muscular coat, and were very different in their appearance from the irregular puckering which is often seen in the inner membrane of the great intestines. When these folds were exa- mined, they were found to consist of an accumulation of cellular membrane, with the inner coat of the gut reflected over it. Upon the inner surface of the great in- testine, about two inches above the anus, little processes soqoetimes grow from the internal membrane: they generally sur- round the gut at short distances from each other, so as to form a sort of circle.

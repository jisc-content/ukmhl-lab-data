[ 340 ] if the gland should increase very consi- derably in its size, those symptoms must necessarily arise which depend upon its enlargement, and which are just about to be mentioned. When the prostate gland becomes en- larged from scirrhus, there is a difficulty in voiding the urine, and a small quantity only is discharged at a time, so that the bladder is kept always nearly full. There is sometimes a total inability to evacuate the urine. In some cases the faeces are passed with difficulty, and when the operation is over, there is still a feeling of something more to be discharged. The straining which attends the evacuation of the urine and the fasces not unfrequently forces out mucus, which had been secreted by the gland. A bougie or catheter is either passed into the bladder with difficulty, or on some occasions is not capable of being passed at all.

C ' ] inflamed membrane, shooting into the co- agulable lymph. Besides serum, we have mentioned that pus is sometimes found in an inflamed cir- cumscribed cavity. When this is the case, it seems extremely probable that the small arteries, distributed in the layer of the co- agulable lymph, have poured out the pus. This, 1 believe, has not hitherto been thought of; but it is difficult to conceive under these circumstances any other source from whence the pus is derived. If the pus be supposed to be formed by the arte- ries which ramify in the inflamed mem- brane itself, then it must transude through a layer of coagulable lymph, which often is of considerable thickness, before it accu- mulates in the cavity. This, however, is not likely; and as arteries pass from the original membrane into the layer of the co- agulable ]ymph,it becomes more reasonable to suppose that pus is formed by the arte- ries distributed in the coagulable lymph, than in the original membrane itself.

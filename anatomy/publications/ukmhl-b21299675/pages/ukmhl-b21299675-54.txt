The serum is generally in a much larger quantity, than could take place in conse- quence of its mere spontaneous separation from the coagulable lymph which is spread upon thesurface of the inflamed membrane. The blood vessels, therefore, which are distributed in the layer of the coagulable lymph, would seem to pour out some quantity of serum. While the inflamma- tion is receding, and the coagulable lymph is changing into adhesions, the serum is ge- nerally taken up from the cavity; and this effect must be supposed to be produced by the action of absorbent vessels. The mem- brane of adhesions must therefore have absorbent vessels belonging to it, which have probably been formed by the elon- gation or growth of the absorbents of the Â«

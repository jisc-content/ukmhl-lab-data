[ 61 ] sons thus affected shall not be sensible of any disease in the chest. If this supposi- tion be not granted, then coagulable lymph may be thrown out upon the surface of the pleura, and adhesions be formed without inflammation : but this conjecture is not so probable as the other. Where adhesions in the chest are long, so as not to impede the free motion of the lungs, respiration is not sensibly affected by them. But where the adhesions are short, tying as it were the lungs closely to the parietes of the chest, and more especially if they be extended over every part of the cavity, then respiration is difficult, and ac- companied with a cough, but there are np symptoms of fever.

[ 350 ] SYMPTOMS. The symptoms which attend the inflam- mation of the inner membrane of the urethra, are too well known to require being mentioned. In stricture of the urethra there is diffi- culty in making water, which is greater or less, according to the degree of the stric- ture; the stream of urine is small, some- times forked, sometimes scattered, and sometimes the urine passes away in drops only. There is frequently also an increased secretion of mucus from the urethra, re- sembling a gleet. Various other symp- toms may take place, in consequence of the parts in the neighbourhood of the stric- ture being affected ; and even the consti- tution is sometimes much disturbed by this local irritation, exhibiting very different symptoms in different individuals.

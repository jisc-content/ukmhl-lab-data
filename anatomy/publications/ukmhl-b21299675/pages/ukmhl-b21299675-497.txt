[ 449 ] IS found in dropsy of the thorax or abdo* men. It appears, however, to be generally of the same nature with the water that is accumulated in both of those large cavities* In some trials which I have made, it partly coagulated upon the application of the common acids, exactly like the water in hydrothorax and ascites, or like the serum of the blood. But there is much variety in the quantity of the coagulable matter. In some instances the water in hydroce- phalus contains a small proportion of coa- gulable matter, and in others it is almost entirely free from it. When water is accumulated in the ven- tricles to a very large quantity, the sub- stance of the brain, especially upon the sides and at the upper surface, is so thin, and the communication is more or less according to the degree of the elevation. It may be said, that the lateral ventricles still communicate together by means of the third ventricle. This, however, is not properly an im- mediate communication between the two lateral ven- tricles, unless any two cavities which communicate with a third, may be properly said to communicate directly or immediately with each other.

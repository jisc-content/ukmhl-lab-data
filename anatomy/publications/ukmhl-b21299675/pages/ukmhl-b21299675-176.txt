[ 128 ] nasum is less connected with the abdominal muscles than with the intestinal canal, so that the inflammation passes less readily from the peritonaeum to the former than to tlie latter part. Inflammation of the peritonaeum is some- times slight and partial; at other times is great, and spread over the whole membrane. When it is slight, and aflPects that part of the peritonaeum which is connected with the intestinal canah it often forms broad sur- faces of inflammation, which run like bands along the.course of the intestines, and are bounded by the contact of different por- tions of the intestines among themselves. In this case the coats of the intestines are not thicker than usual, the inflammation being slight, and confined to the peritonaeum it- self Where the inflammation is great, the intestines are much thicker, and more massy. This evidently arises from the greater accumulation of blood in the small blood vessels, as well as from the extrava- sation of fluids into the substance of the

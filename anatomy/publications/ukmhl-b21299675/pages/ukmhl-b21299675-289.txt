The coals of the gall-bladder are very rarely inflamed, without inflammation of the membrane which covers the posterior surface of the liver. When inflammation attacks this membrane, it naturally spreads over the outer coat of the gall-bladder, which is a continuation of it, and may affect Uie other coats of the gall bladder* if it should have arisen to a violent degree.

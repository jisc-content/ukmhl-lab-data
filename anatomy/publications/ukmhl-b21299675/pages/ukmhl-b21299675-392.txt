The stone had pro- bably been driven into the cavity of the membranous part of the urethra, by the stream of urine from the bladder, but was too large to pass by the same means th rough the whole length of the urethra; it there- fore stuck in that situation, and was gra- dually increased to the size which we have described, by the contact of the urine, simi- lar to the growth of a stone in the pelvis of the ureters.

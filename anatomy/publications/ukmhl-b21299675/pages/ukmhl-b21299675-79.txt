[ 31 ] Ossificalion of the Coronary Arteries of the Heart. The coronary arteries are occasionally ossified in a greater or less degree. This state of them is, I believe, generally ac- companied with ossified portions of the aorta at its origin, and sometimes with ossi- ficalion of the semi-lunar valves. Ossification of the Semi-lunar Valves. The three semi-lunar valves at the ori- gin of the aorta, or of the pulmonary artery^ are often found diseased. The disease very commonly consists in the deposition of a bony or earthy matter, and would seem to be formed by a morbid action of some very minute vessels which are distributed through the substance of the valves. These vessels are so small, as not to contain, in their natural state, the red globules of the blood.

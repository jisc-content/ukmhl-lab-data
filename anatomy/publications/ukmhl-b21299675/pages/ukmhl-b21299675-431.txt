Of its nature I cannot speak particularly, as I hav» never seen an instance of this disease. I think it probable, however, that the water . accumulated in the cavity of the uterus, resembles in its properties the serum; and that it is poured out by the small curling arteries of the uterus. In cases where water is really accumulated in the cavity of the uterus, one must suppose a stricture of the cervix, otherwise the water would escape gradually into the vagina, as it is formed. I am disposed to believe, however, that where water has been said to be accumulated in the cavity of the uterus, it has frequently been really in one or more large hydatids formed in that cavity."f ♦ Vid. Lieutaud, Tom. I. p. 319, p- 333. f Dr. Denman has had an opportunity of observing a case, where water was accumulated in one large hy- datid of the uterus.

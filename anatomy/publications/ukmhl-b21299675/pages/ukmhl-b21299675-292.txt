[ 2U ] verted in many parts into a sort of bony substance; but this is to be considered as a very rare appearance of disease. Diseased slate of the Biliary Duels.â€”Their Dilatation. The most common diseased appearance of the biliary ducts, is their dilatation. The ductus hepaticus, ductus cysticus, and duc- tus communis choiedoclius, are sometimes dilated to an almost incredible size. I have seen the ductus hepaticus and choledochus so much dilated as to be nearly an inch in the transverse diameter. These dilatations of the biliary ducts take place in conse- quence of the passage of gall-stoniss ; and it is astonishing how large gall-stones some- times are, which have been known to pass into the duodenum. This ought to afford a strong ground of comfort to persons who are labouring under this complaint.

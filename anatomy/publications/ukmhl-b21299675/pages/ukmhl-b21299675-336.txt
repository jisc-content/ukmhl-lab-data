Whatever be the nature of the obstruc- tion, if the pelvis of the ureter be very much enlarged from the accumulation of the urine, the cavity of the kidney is at the same time enlarged. As this i)rocess ad- vances, the substance of the kidney be- comes more and more compressed, is gra- dually absorbed, and its cavity becomes enlarged in proportion.

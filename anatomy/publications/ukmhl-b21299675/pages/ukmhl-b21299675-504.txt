[ 456 ] Aneurysm of the internal Carotid Arteries on the Side of the Sella Turcica, The internal carotid arteries are very apt in persons of an advanced age, to be- come ossified, and the same morbid change may be traced along their branches. It occurs, however, very rarely that they arc distended at any part into an aneurysmal sack, like the arteries in some other parts of the body. I have been informed of arj instance of this kind, where both the in- ternal carotid arteries, on the side of the sella turcia, were distended into a little aneurysm.* One of these aneurysms was about the size of a cherry, and the other was somewhat smaller. It is remarkable that in the only two instances which have come to my knowledge, of aneurysms be- inany instances of it, and a case occurred some years ago to Mr. Wilson, lecturer on anatomy, whose accu- racy is well known, where the cavity which remained was of a very large size. â™¦ I owe my acquaintance with this case to Dr. Blane.

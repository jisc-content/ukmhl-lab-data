C 530 ] hydatids have been found in the brains of sheep, resembling almost exactly those in the human liver, and which have been seen to move, and therefore are certainly known to be animalcules. The hydatids of the human liver indeed, have not as far as I know, been found to move when taken out of the body and put into warm water; had this ever happened, no uncertainty would remain. It is not difficult to see a good reason why there will hardly occur any proper opportunity of making this ex- periment.

The probabi- lity of their being animalcules, however, is very strong; and it appears even more difficult to account for their production according to the common theory of gene- ration, than for that of intestinal worms. We do not get rid of the difficulty by

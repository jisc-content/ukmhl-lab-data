[ 106 ] necessarily acquired a valvular communi- cation with it. In proportion as the bai^^en- larged, this valvular communication would become more and more com[)lete, till at length every kind of food must have rested in the bag, and could not pass into the oesophagus. In this way the person was destroyed. The lower end of the pharynx is, perhaps, the only part of the canal where such an accident can happen. The pha- rynx is not contracted gradually, so as to lose itself insensibly in the oesophagus, but contracts itself rather suddenly at the lower end. Hence a little recess is formed, in Avhich an extraneous body may occasionally rest. This would be most apt to happen at the posterior part; so that if the recess should be enlarged into a cavity, it would generally pass behind the oesophagus. The particulars of this singular case have been published in the Medical Observations,* â€¢ See ihe Medical Observations, Vol. III. p. 85.

C 33 ] Falves between the Auricles and the Ventricles ossified. The valvular apparatus between the au- ricles and ventricles, is liable to the forma- tion of bony and earthy matter in it, in the same manner as the valves which are situ- ated at the origin of the two large arteries, but by no means so frequently. What this depends upon, it is very difficult to deter- mine. These valves may perhaps be con- sidered as belonging more to the venal than the arterial system, and it is certain that ossification takes place very seldom in veins, although very often in arteries. The same Valves thick and opaque. The valvular apparatus between the au- ricles and ventricles is also occasionally thickened, having lost all its transparency, and having an opaque white colour. The chordae tendinese likewise become thicker than natural; and the internal membrane lining the ventricles is frequently at the D

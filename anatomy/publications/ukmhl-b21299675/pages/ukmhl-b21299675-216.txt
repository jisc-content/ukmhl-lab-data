/ [ 168 ] I have had with persons whose Hne of life leads them to give particular attention to this disease, I anm disposed to think that this opinion is ill founded. Ruptures are found to be as frequent in persons who are not cor- pulent, as in those who are.* There is hardly any viscus which has not at some time or other, been found in the sack of a rupture, but most frequently it is either a portion of the omentum, or of the intestines, or of both. The bag formed by the peritonicum m.ay be thrust out almost at any part of the belly; but this happens most frequently at the ring of the extenial oblique muscle, under Paupart's ligament, and at the navel: it also sometimes takes place at other parts of the abdomen. There is another situation where a rupture has been known to happen, although very rarely, viz. through an opening in the dia- phragm into the thorax. The opinion * The umbilical rupture should be considered as aa exception to this remark, for it is much more common in fat people than those of a spare habit.

In this disease the arcli of the aorta is much enlarged beyond its usual size, sometimes forming an unil'orm tumour; at other times smaller aneurysmal swelhngs which rise out of the larger one. This enlargement of the artery, if very considerable, is more or less filled with coagulated blood, which is disposed in concentric laminae. The coats of the di- lated artery are nearly of the same thick- ness with those in its natural state; and therefore in proportion as the swelling in- creases, new matter must be deposited in the coats of the artery. This new matter would seem to be deposited with a view to prevent the artery from being so soon rup- tured as it would be otherwise, and is formed by the action of the vasa vasorum. A portion of the new matter may perhaps

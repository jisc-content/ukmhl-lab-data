The third species consists of the acid of sugar and acid of phosphorus united with lime; together generally with some lithic acid in the interstices. This species is knotted on its outer surface somewhat like a mulberry, and from this circumstance it has commonly been called the mulberry calculus. It is of a dark brown colour, and consists of an irregularly laminated struc- ture. The laminae of which it is compose^ often vary in their colour, some [of them being dark, and others of a white colour. The white laminae are commonly towards the outer part of the calculus, although its colour be dark. The fourth species consists entirely of phosphorated lime, and has been called the bone-earlh calculus. It is of a light brown colour, and its laminae slightly adhere to each other.

The inner membrane is also extremely thick and hard, and not unfrequently somewhat tu- berculated or irregularly elevated to^vards the cavity of the stomach. It frequently happens that this thick- ened mass is ulcerated upon its surface, and then a stomach is said to be cancerous. Sometimes the inner membrane of the stomach throws out a process which ter- minates in a great many smaller processes, and produces what has been commonly called a fungous appearance. It also happens that the stomach at some part loses entirely all vestige of its natural structure, and is changed into a very hard mass, of a v/hitish colour, with some ap- pearance of membrane intersecting it: or it is converted into a gristly substance, like cartilage somewhat softened. The absor- bent glands in the neighbourhood are at the same time commonly enlarged, and have a very hard white structure.

Aneu- rysms hardly ever happen in the pulmo- nary artery, because there is no arch formed by the pulmonary artery, and the blood readily passes by two large branches into the substance of the lungs. Aneurysms in the arch of the aorta, as well as in every other part of the arterial system, happen much more rarely in wo- men than in men. This arises from two causes.

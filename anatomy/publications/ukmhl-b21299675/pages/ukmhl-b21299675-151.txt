[ 103 ] account which the late Dr. Hunter used to give of the frequent situation of ulcers at the upper and lower extnsmities of the oesophagus, and it seems to have great weight. It h'ippens, however, most com- monly that ulcers of the oesophagus arise spontaneously, or in other words, iVom causes within itself which we cannot ascer- tain. When an ulcer takes place at the upper end of the oesophagus, it is apt to spread into the substance of the thyroid gland. In this case the gland becomes hard, enlarged, and ulcerated : but in some instances it has been known to enlarge, where the ulcer of the oesophagus had not spread so far as to reach it. (Esophagus carlilagiiious. A portion of the oesophagus has been ob- served by some anatomists to be converted into cartilage, and to have its diameter at â€¢ that part very much diminished in size.* * Vid. Bonet. Tom 11. p. 32.

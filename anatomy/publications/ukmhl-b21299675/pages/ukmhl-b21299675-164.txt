[ 116 ] Bronchoccle may be distinguished from other swellings of the thyroid gland, by its slow growth, by the size at which it is ca- pable of arriving, by its want of pain, by its commonly occurring at an early period .of life, by the sensation it yields to the touch, which is that of more or less fii mness, but not of great hardness, and by the health being unaffected by it. size, there is a strong proof of a consent or syiiipalliy existing between the superficial and deeper seated ab- sorbent vessels. When, for instance, a swelled tesiicle is reduced to i.ts natural size by rubbing mercurial •oint- ment upon the surface of the scrotum which covers it, it cannot be supposed that any part of the ointment comes in contact with the absorlvnt vessels belonging to the substame of the tesiicle; yet these absorbenls are excited to an increased action by the application ot the ointment, atid the testicle is at length reduced to its natural size. • This effect would seem only capable of being explained upon the principle of a consent or sym- pathy existing between the absorbents of the scrotum and the abse;bents of the substance of the tesiicle, by which, u hen the former nre stimulated, the latter are roused to an increased action.

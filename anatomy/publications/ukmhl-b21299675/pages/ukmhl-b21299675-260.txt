[ ] striking circumstances, with the symptoms which are produced by the common round worm of the intestines. In both diseases there is a tumid belly, and emaciated extre- mities. They are chiefly to be distinguished by worms not being discovered in the one disease, notwithstanding the use of strong purgatives, while they pass off from the bowels in the other. The startings, and the grinding of the teeth, may perhaps also form some ground of distinction between the two diseases: they occur very commonly in worms, but I believe rarely where the glands of the mesentery are scrofulous, Some dis- crimination likewise between the two dis- eases, may sometimes be derived from exa- mining strictly into the nature of the consti- tution. If decided marks of scrofula shew themselves in an external part of the body, they will lead a practitioner more satisfacto- rily to the opinion, that the mesentericglands are also affected with the same disease.

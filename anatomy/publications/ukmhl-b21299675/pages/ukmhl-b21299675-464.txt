C 416 ] Ulcers of the Vagina. Ulcerations are not unusual in the va- gina. They sometimes appear like spots of the internal surface, removed as it were by a knife, and sometimes there is a foul ragged ulcer. When this last is the case in any considerable degree, the ulcer has commonly not originated in the vagina, but has spread to it from the womb. When the ulcer spreads very much, communi- cations are often made with the neighbour- ing parts, producing a most miserable state of existence. Thus communications are sometimes formed between the vagina and the rectum, or the vagina and the bladder. Scirrhous Tumours in the Vagina, Scirrhous tumours occasionally arise in the vagina itself (although, I believe, rarely) when the utems is unaffected. When cut into, they exhibit the usual scirrhous struc- ture which has been often described.

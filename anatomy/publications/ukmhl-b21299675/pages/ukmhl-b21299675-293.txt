[ 24^ ] Oblileralion of the Bilianj Duds. An obliteraLion of any of the biliary ducts happens very rarely, but instances of this disease have been discovered, and they may be traced to the following causes. One cause is a violent inflammation, which has taken place in the inner surface of some of the biliary ducts, and has terminated in an adhesion of its sides. This may be sup- posed to arise most commonly from the irritation of a rough -gall-stone, in its pas- sage towards the duodenum. A similar adhesion has been known to take place in other canals of the body, in consequence of violent inflammation there, as, for instance, in the vagina. Another cause, which may act upon the lower extremity of the ductus communis choledochus, obliterating its ca- vity at that part, is a violent inflammation of the duodenum at the entrance of the duct; the extremity of the duct being in- volved in the inflammation, may have its canal obliterated. To this may be added.

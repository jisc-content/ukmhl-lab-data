[ 379 ] where the soft parts have been very much relaxed by repeated and severe labours. This disease is called prolapsus uteri, and will be explained more particularly when we come to treat of the diseases of the vagina. It is much more frequent than the other disease called the inversio uteri. Stricture in the Cavity of the Uterus, A stricture is, sometimes formed within the cavity of the uterus, so that its cavity at one part is obliterated entirely. This I believe almost always to take place at one part, viz. where the cavity of the fundus uteri terminates, and that of the cervix be- gins, for in this place the cavity of the uterus is narrowest. As the sides of the cavity round this place lie very near each other, and form naturally a small aperture, it is probable that some slight inflamma- tion may unite the parts together, and shut up the aperture; or the parts may gradually approach each other without this cause, as in strictures of the urethra.

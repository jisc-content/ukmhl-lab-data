[ 8S ] size. The viscid fluid, when the gland has been preserved for some time in spirits, is changed into a transparent jelly. From this account of the morbid change of structure which takes place in bronchocele, it seems not unreasonable to suppose that the swell- ing depends upon a vitiated and increased secretion in tbe oland. The secretion be- ing in large quantity, gradually distends the cells, increasing thereby their capacity, and this enlargement of the cells forms the general swelling of the gland. Scirrhiis of the Tliijroid Gland. The thyroid gland sometimes becomes scirrhous, but is not so liable to this disease as some other glands of the body. When it is affected by this disease, it becomes en- larged in its size, but not to any consider- able degree, and is hard to the feeling. When a section is made of it, it is found to consist of a solid substance, with very little of that cellular structure which is so strong- ly marked in bronchocde.

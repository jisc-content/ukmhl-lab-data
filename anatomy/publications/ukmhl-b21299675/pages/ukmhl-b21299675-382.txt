C 334 ] Scirrhus of the Prostate Gland. The most common disease of the pros- tate gland is a scirrhous enlargement of it. The prostate gland, it is well known, is naturally about the size of a large chesnut, but when it is affected with scirrhus, it is often enlarged to the size of the fist. In this enlarged state when cut into it exhibits a very firm, whitish, or brown substance, with membranous septa running through it in various directions, which are often very strongly marked. This is the com- mon appearance of scirrhus in other parts of the body. When the prostate gland is a good deal enlarged, its cavity becomes deeper from the growth of its sides, and the posterior extremity forms a considera- ble projection into the cavity of the blad- der, which interrupts the passage of the urine into the urethra.* According to the * Mr. Home has lately discovered that this posterior projection is owing to the enlargement of a small sepa- rate lobule of the prostate gland^ not hitherto known.

In such cases too the testicle is a good deal compressed, and has sometimes been known to waste in consequence of this compression. The fluid which is accumulated is of a yellow- ish, a greenish, or brown colour, and re- sembles in its properties the serum of the blood. This disease, in persons who are advanced in life, is frequently combined with a scirrhous state of the testicle, which will be afterwards particularly described. In almost all cases of hydrocele the water is contained in one bag, but in a few in- stances it has been known to be contained in several cysts. Of this I recollect a re- markable example which occurred a few years ago. This variety is probably pro- duced by repeated partial inflammations on the inner surface of the tunica vaginalis, and occasioning adhesions, which put on the appearance of cysts.

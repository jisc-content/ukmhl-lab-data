[ 315 ] chemical analysis of urinary calculi has been ascertained with sufficient accuracy, and they have been found to consist of six species very different,from each other. The first species is more common than the others, and consists of a particular acid called lithic acid, mixed with some gela> tinous matter, and in some instances with a very small proportion of lime. Its texture is partly laminated and partly porous. Its colour is brown, varying a good deal in the depth of its shade, and sometimes with a very slight yellowish tinge. The chem- ical properties of this species of urinary calculi were first ascertained by Scheeie and Bergman. The second species consists of crystals which are formed by the combination of phosphoric acid with magnesia and ammo- nia : these are mixed with some phospho- rated lime, and generally som.e lithic acid. It is of a white colour, is more irregular in its shape thdn some of the other species, and consists partly of a laminated and

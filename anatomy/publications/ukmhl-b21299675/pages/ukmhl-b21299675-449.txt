These productions are much more frequent in the ovaria than any where else, probably because the process which forms them bears some analogy to gene- ration, in which the ovaria are materially concerned. I must still therefore, what- ever objections have been made to it, retain my former opinion. These masses in the ovaria are commonly about the size of a large orange.* * I have very lately met with the same kind of fatty substance intermixed with hair, and the body of one tootii covered with enamel, in the ovarium of a young woman about eighteen years of age. In this case the uterus was rather less than its usual size in the adult when unimpregnated, and there was no membrana decidua whatever formed in its cavity.

I have been informed by Mr. Colnian, that a dead Dd

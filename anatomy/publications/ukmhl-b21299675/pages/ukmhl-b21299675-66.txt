It seems to me reasonable to sup- pose, that when scrofulous tumours grow in the pericardium, there will hardly be any inconvenience felt while they are small; but when they enlarge very much in size, they will necessarily prevent the full dila- tation of the heart, and disturb its functions. This, however, will probably be very diffi- cult to be distinguished from the disturb- ance produced by other causes, which must in the same manner impede the free action of the heart; as, for instance, the accumu- lation of water in the pericardium. The symptoms produced by a defect of the lubricating fluid in the pericardium are at present unknown.

[ US ] a real iRTniaplirodile structure has occa- sionally been lound, yet it has hardly ever occurred in the human subject.* When the vagina has been lon^ subject to inver- sion, its inner surface becomes in many parts harder; it is apt to be occasionally inflamed from external irritation, which not uncommonly advances to ulceration. * Although the examples of what have been called herraaphioditcs in the human species have, when strictly examined, been hitherto found to belong to the male or the female sex; jet Dr. Storer of Nottingham has favoured me with an account of a person so strongly marked as a hermaphrodite, that no doubt can, I think, be reasonably entertained of this being the case. The person to whom this singular monstrosity belongs, is still alive, and has been carefully examined by Dr. Storer and other medical gentlemen, very able to judge concerning it; I shall therefore take the liberty of in- serting here, the account which Dr. Storer was so obliging as to send me. The person bears a woman's name, and wears the apparel of a woman. She has a remarkable masculine look, with plain features, but no beard. She had never menstruated; and on this account she was desired by the lady with whom she lived as servant, to become an out patient at the Nottingham Hospital. At this time she was twenty-four years of age, and had not been sen- sible of any bad health, but only came to the hospital in order to comply with the wishes of her mistress.

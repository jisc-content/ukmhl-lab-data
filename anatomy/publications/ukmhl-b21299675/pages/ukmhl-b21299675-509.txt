These are the principal dise?ised changes which take place in the brain and its ap- pendages. I have just to add, that the brain is subject to great variety from ori- ginal monstrous formation. A great part of what is usually called the cerebrum is sometimes wanting, while the cerebellum, and the medulla spinalis are entire; some- times there is hardly any vestige of either the cerebrum or cerebellum, and the me- dulla spinalis is very much diminished in size: at other times there is a total want of the brain, and there is no appearance of the medulla spinalis. In this case, one should expect a want of nerves through u fibrous structure could be observed pretty distinctly^ similar to that of a nerve.

[ us ] to a few ounces, and occasionally to many pints. When the quantity of water is very considerable, the fornix is raised at its anterior extremity in consequence of its accunuilation, and an immediate opening of communication is thereby formed be- tween the lateral ventricles.* From this cause too a part of the water passes very readily into the third ventricle, and from thence into the fourth. The whaler is of a purer colour, and more limpid, than what * A distinguished author has, in a late publication, insisted very strongly upon the existence of an immedi- ate communicntion bf '.ween the two lateral ventricles of the brain^ and has expressed great surprise that it has been denied by several teachers of anatomy in London. Without entering into any dispute about this matter, \vhich in itself is of no great importance, 1 shall briefly raention what appears to me to be the real state of the circumstances. The fornix at its anterior extremity lies loose upon a pari of the lhalami nervoruiii opticorum, and there is a small chink on each side of the fornix leading obliquely downwards from the lateral ventricles to the anterior extremity of the third ventricle. While the fornix is allowed to remain in its natural situation, there seems to me to be no immediate communication between the lateral ventricles. But when the fornix h elevated (which may be very easily done) then the la- teral ventricles communicate directly with each other;

[ 214 ] When inflammation takes place in the membrane of the liver, it exhibits exactly the same appearances, which have been de- scribed when speaking of the inflannnation of the peritonaeum, of which it is a part. It is crowded with a great number of very mi- nute Vessels, which contain florid blood, and is thicker than in its natural state. There is also thrown out upon its surface, a layer ofcoagulable lymph: this layer is thicker on some occasions than others, and often glues the liver, more or less completely to the neighbouring parts. Some quantity of serous fluid is at the same time thrown out. Jdhesions. It is more common to see adhesions form- ed, which are the consequence of a previous inflammation in the membrane of the liver, than to see the membrane in an actual state of iijflarnmaiion. These adhesions are formed from the coagulable lymj)h of the blood which undergoes a gradual progiess of change, as we have formerly described.

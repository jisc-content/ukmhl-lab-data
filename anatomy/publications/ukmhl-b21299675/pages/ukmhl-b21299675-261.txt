[ ^15 3 CHAP. IX. DISEASED APPEARANCES OF THE LIVER. Inflammation of the Membrane of the Liver. The external membrane of the liver is not uncommonly found in a state of in- flammation. This may take place when the perito- naeum generally over the cavity of the ab- domen is inflamed, or the inflammation may be confined to the membrane of the liver itself. When it is confined to the mem- brane of the liver, it is not frequently ex- tended over the whole of it, but more com- monly takes place in that part which covers the anterior, or convex part of the liver. I have also seen inflammation, or at least its efiects, not unfrequently on that side of the liver, which is in contact with the sto- mach and the duodenum.

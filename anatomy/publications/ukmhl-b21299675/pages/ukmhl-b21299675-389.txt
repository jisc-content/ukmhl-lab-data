[ S4l ] Calculi occur so rarely in the prostate gland, that their symptoms have been little taken notice of by authors. When the cal- culi are very small, so as to be confined en- tirely within the ducts of the prostate gland, it is probable that little inconvenience is produced by them. When they are larger, and form a projection into the cavity of the prostate gland, there must necessarily be difficulty in voiding the urine, and there* will be the same feeling when a sound or catheter is attempted to be passed into the bladder, as if an urinary calculus had got fixed or impacted in the neck of the bladder.

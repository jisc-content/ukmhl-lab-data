C 20 ] sometimes oozes out slowly, and the person sinks gradually under its loss. Aneurysms at the arch of the aorta, as well as in every other part of the arterial system, arise from the coats of the artery being previously diseased, which are there- by unable to resist sufficiently the impetus of blood that strikes against them. This is obvious, both from the diseased structure of the coats of an aneurysm itself, and ol the artery in its neighbourhood. I have also found very frequently diseas- ed appearances in the arch of the aorta, which had not advanced far enouiih to produce aneurysm. These consist in little white opaque spots being formed in the inner membrane of the artery, and its coats are in such cases more easily separable from each other than in the healthy state. The reason why aneurysms take place more frequently in the arch of the aorta, than in any other part of the arterial sys- tem, is its curvature, which exposes it to the full impetus of the blood propelled by

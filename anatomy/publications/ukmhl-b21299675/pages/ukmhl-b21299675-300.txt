Gall-stones according to the experiments of Gren, consist of a substance possessing the properties of wax and of lymph.* A gall-stone, consisting of a chocolate co- loured substance on the outside and of white radiated lamelliE upon the inside, was found by Dr. Saunders to consist of a resinous matter, with a small proportion of earth,, apparently the calcareous, and some mineral and volatile alkali.t The gall-stones which Dr. Powell exa- mined were found to consist of resinous matter, carbon, and an animal substance resembling dried mucus.This subject seems still to be imperfectly known, and to require further investigation. * See Johnson's Animal Chemistry, VoJ. 2, p. 3.55. f See Dr. Saunders's Treatise on the Liver, p. 119. first edition. ; X See Dr. Powell's Observations on the Bile and iti Diseases.

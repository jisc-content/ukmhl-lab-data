It is a species of monstrous formation, not very uncommon, that the rectum does not terminate in the anus, but in a cul-de- sac, without reaching the exlerual surface. Sometimes the extremity of the gut lies near the external surface, but more com- monly it is at some distance from il. In these cases there is usually the appearance of an anus, but the oj)ening is more con- tracted than in the natural structure. It seldom happens that this malformation can be effectually remedied by a chirurgical operation. The opening which is made into the extremity of the gut has generally such a disposition to close, that the benefit which might naturally be expected from an operation is frustrated. A few cases however have occurred in which the oper- ation has been successful.

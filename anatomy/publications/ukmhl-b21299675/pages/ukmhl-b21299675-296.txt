[ m 3 when there is a considerable number, they acquire by rubbing upon each other, in a small space, a great many sides and angles. There is great variety in the external appearance of gall-stones with respect to colour: some are whitish, others are black; they are also of a yellowish, a greenish, a light brown, a dark brown, and a reddish- brown colour. These are the principal varieties in colour,but there are many other smaller differences which it is very difficult to express in words. Gall-stones differ also very much in the stale of their surface, some being very smooth, and others a good deal roughened. When cut or broken, gall-stones are commonly found to consist of concentric laminae upon the outside, and in the centreÂ» of a radiated structure. The laminated part bears sometimes a great proportion to the other, and sometimes the contrary happens. The laminated and radiated structures are sometimes compact, and sometimes consist of a more loose matter.

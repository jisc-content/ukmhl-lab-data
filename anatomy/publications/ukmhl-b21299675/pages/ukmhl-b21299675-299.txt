[ 251 ] this oil, and exposed to a sand heat, they are nmuch more readily acted upon. Some are converted into a kind of oil, which sinks to the bottom of the oil of turpentine; others are partly soluble, tinging the oil of turpentine of a brownish colour, and are partly separated into a powder. Most gall-stones appear not to be readily afiected by spirit of wine in the common heat of the atmosphere, but are either partly or entirely soluble in it in a boiling heat.* Such are the general results from a good many trials of my own, but I should rest upon them with little confidence, if they did not in a great measure correspond with those of the experiments of others who ^re * When some biliary calculi are exposed to spirit of wine in a boiling stale, white flaky crystals are soota formed upon its cooling. When they are exposed to gpirit of wine in the common heat of the atmosphere, it is some weeks before crystals begin to be formed, and they appear to be more pointed in their shape than the former. These crystal* were, 1 believe, first observed by M. Poulletier de la Salle. See El^mens d'Histoire Isaturelle et de Chimie, par M. de Fourcroy, Torn. IV. p. 354.

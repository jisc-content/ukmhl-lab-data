OSSIFICATION of the BONES of the THORAX. STERNUM. NORMAL CENTRES - Six. - One in centre of each primitive segment: ~ Manubrium - One, 5th or Cth month. Gladiolus - Four, as follows :- First & Second Segments - One each, 6th or 7th month. Third Segment - One, 9th month. Fourth Segment - One, 1st or 2nd year after birth. EnsifOTHl Appendix - One, between 2nd and 18th years. ADDITIONAL CENTRES - Are not infrequently met with. Thus the Manubrium - May have Two centres one above the other, of which the upper one is the larger; or three, or sometimes six. - It frequently presents Two small Episternal Centres, one on each side of interclavicular notch. Second; Third, & Fourth Segments of Gladiolus - May have Two Lateral Centres Each - The occasionally imperfect union of which centres may give rise to a sternal foramen. The ensiform appendix &= the first segment op the gladiohis have larely more than one centre each. UNION - Takes place between the above pieces as follows :- Gladiolus - (From below upwards): Third & Fourth Segments - Soon after puberty. Second 6° ThirdSegmnits - Between 20th and 25th years. First &= Second Segments-A little later. Gladiolus & Ensiform Appendix - Middle period of life. Manubrium & Gladiolus -■ In very advanced age. RIBS " Three centres each, except in case of two last. Shaft - One, in postericr part, 7th or 8th week. - Ossification extends rapidly, and reaches situation of permanent (costal) cartilage about 4th month. Head ) \ ~ One each; 16th to 20th year; join with shaft about 2vthyear. Tubercle ) The two last ribs, having no tubercles, are ossified, each from t\vo centres only.

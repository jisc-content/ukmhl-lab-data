133 THE PATELLA. Flat, triangular, situated at front of knee-joint. Ts regarded by some as a sesamoid bone developed in tendon of quadriceps extensor femoris, by others as the homologue of the ole- cranon. Presents two surfaces, three borders, & an apex. SURFACES - Are: Anterior - Subcutaneous, convex, marked by rough vertical stria?, & perforated by numerous vascular foramina; is covered by an expansion of tendon of quadriceps, the fibres of which expansion are continuous with superficial fibres of ligamentum patellae. Posterior - Divided into: Upper ok* Articular Portion - Corresponds to upper three-fourths of the surface, and is divided by a prominent vertical ridge into two concave facets, of which the inner one, the smallest & shallowest, is further diminished by a slightly marked vertical ridge, which vertical ridge cuts ofT a nar- row marginal portion corresponding to the inner border of the bone ; this marginal portion comes in contact during flexion of the knee-joint with the inner border ot the intercondyloid notch (Lenoir, Goodsir). - In well marked bones the two concave facets are divided by two transverse ridges into three horizontal bands, which rest in succession upon the femoral trochlea during the movements of flexion & extension of the joint (Goodsir). Lower or Non.articular Portion - The lower fourth; forms a rough transversa groove for attachment of greater part of ligamentum patellae. BORDERS — Are : Superior - Thick, cut obliquely at expense of anterior surface, for tendons of rectus & crureus, Lateral - Thinner, converging inferiorly, for tendons of vasti & capsule of knee-joint. - The inner border is marked posteriorly by the small marginal facet abovo mentioned APEX — Directed downwards; forms part posteriorly of rough groove above mentioned for liga. mentum patellae

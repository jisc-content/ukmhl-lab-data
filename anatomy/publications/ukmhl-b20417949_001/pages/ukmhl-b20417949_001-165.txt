155 processes? Correlated with the view of a second centre for the vertebral bodies generally, is there an additional centre for the body of the axis ? And are there additional centres for the bodies of the five sacral vertebra;? Of two well-known authorities, one gives one view, and the other the other. The point may be put somewhat as follows :— Hinauf and Hinab are editors of German text-books, not uninterested, some say, in recording friendly labours directed, those recorded by Hinauf at over-capping or contradicting those recorded by Hinab, and those recorded by Hinab at over-capping or contradicting those recorded by Hinauf - this in regard to the " zone of strife," where, writes an eminent Professor, " Truth and Error mingle in conflict, and the results of yesterday have power because they are new." — Says Hinauf: Vertebra?, three primary centres. — Fays Hinab, Four. And herewith Hinab proceeds to show, - on paper, - for the vertebral bodies, " two centres, whieh sometimes unite." — Says Hinauf : Vertebra?, five secondary centres. — Says Hinab, Six. And herewith Hinab proceeds to describe for the spinous processes '4 two centres, or .... sometimes one."* What are the authorities of Hinauf and Hinab ? The author confesses that he does not set much store by the details of Bone development, except as regardsjuota few practical points; and that he thinks it a pity that students should be expected (but are they expected?) to " get them all up," merely to forget them again. * The two views are given, one in the text, the other in the figures. It may be explained that Hinauf is the German for up there ; Hinab the German for down there. The supposed names are compounds of the German aiif and in (up and doivn), with the preposition hin indicative of direction

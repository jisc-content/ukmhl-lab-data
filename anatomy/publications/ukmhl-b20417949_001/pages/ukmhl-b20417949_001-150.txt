OSSIFICATION of LONG BONES with TWO EPIPHYSES- 1st Tablet BONES OF UPPER LIMB. HUMERUS - Seven centres, sometimes eight, - for Shaft - 8th week. Head - 1st or 2nd year. Greater Tuberosity - 3rd year. The Lesser Tuberosity is ossified either by extension of osseous tissue from greater tuberosity, or from a separate centre which appears in 5th year. In this same year the centres for the head &= tuberosities are united into] one epiphysis, which is joined to the shatt about 21st year. Capitellum, & Outer Portion of Trochlea - 2nd or 3rd year. Inner Condyle - 5th year. Inner Portion of Trochlea - nth or 12th year. Outer Condyle - 13th or 14th year. The outer condyle &• the two portions of inferior articular stir face unite to form one epiphysis, which is joined to the shaft about 16th or 17th year. The inner condyle forms a separate epiphysis, which is joined to thei shaft about 18th year. RADIUS - Three centres, for Shaft - 8th week, a little after humerus. Lower Epiphysis - 2nd or 3rd year. Upper Epiphysis - 5th year. These epiphyses are joined to the shaft as follows: - Upper Epiphysis - 17th or 18th year. Lower Epiphysis - 20th year. ULNA - Three centre,?, for Shaft - 8th week, a little after radius. Lower Epiphysis - For head & styloid process, 4th or 5th year. Upper Epiphysis - For extremity of olecranon, 10th year. Ooronoid process, and all but extremity of olecranon, is formed by extension of osseous tissue of shaft. These epiphyses are joined to the «haft as follows •. - Upper Epiphysis - 16th year. Lower Epiphysis - 20th year.

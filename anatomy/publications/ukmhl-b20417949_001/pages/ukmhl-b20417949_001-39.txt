31 [Â»HE COSTAL CAKTILAGE S. Twelve. The first seven connect corresponding rib to sternum, the three next are joined to cartilage of rib above, the last two are unattached in front. In breadth, they decrease from the first to the last, as do also the intercostal spaces. /;/ length, they increase lrom the 1st to the 7th, and then diminish from the 8th to the 12th. In direction, the first is slightly oblique downwards, the second horizontal, the third slightly oblique upwards; the two last follow the direction of the corresponding ribs; all the others follow this direction for a short distance, and then ascend more & more obli- quely to the sternum or to the preceding cartilage. They all taper towards their sternal end, excepting the two first; the sixth, seventh, eighth, & ninth are enlarged at their points of articulation with each other. They present: - Anterior Surface - Con res, looks upwards & forwards, - for subclavius, pectoralis major, & rhomboid or costo-clavicular ligament. Posterior Surface - Concave, looks downwards & backwards, - for triangularis si erni, trans- versalis, & diaphragm. Upper Border - Concave. For intercostals. Presents the chondro.chondral interarticular facets in the 7th, 8:h, & 9th cartilages. Lower Border - Convex. For intercostals, internal oblique & rectus abdominis. Presents the chondro.chondral interarticular facets in the 6th, 7th, & 8th cartilages. Costal Extremity - The largest; rough & rounded, implanted into, & continuous with, anterior extremity of corresponding rib. Anterior or Sternal Extremity - The smallest. Smooth & triangular, and fits into sternal articular notch, in the case of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, & 7th cartilages; pointed, and joins with the cartilage above, in the case of the 8th, 9th, & 10th ; pointed & free in the case of the 11th & 12th ; enlarged and directly continuous with the sternum in the case of the 1st

THE VERTEBR33. Present for examination : - Cody - Forms a short column, which presents: Ant. Surface - Convex from side to side, concave from above downwards: presents numerous small vasculnr foramina. I Post. Surface - Concave from side to side, fiat from above downwards; presents j one or more irregular apertures for exit of venae basis vertebrae. | Upper & Under Surfaces - Rough & slightly concave, and surrounded by a pro- minent rim. Pedicles - J0,tl the body to the laminae. They are constricted, and their constriction gives rise to the Notches - Which latter, by the superposition of the vertebrae, form the intervertebral fora- mina. LaniillSe - Broad & flat, rough above & below for the ligamenta subflava; bound posteriorly the Foramen - Which, by the superposition of the vertebrae, forms the spinal canal. Spinous process -Projects backwards from the point of junction of the laminae. Transverse processes - Two. Project outwards from the sides of the arch. Articular processes - Four. Project upwards & downwards from the point of junction of the pedicles with the laminae. The superior ones look backwards, the inferior ones look forwards. N. â€” Bit little, which would be applicable to each of the three groups j of vertebrae, can, it is believed, be added to this description. |

A A, occipital bone in a foetus of 10 weeks ; a, tabular part ; 1 & 2, low er and upper pairs of centres; b, lower part of basilar and condylar portions: ossific centres are seen in the condylar portions. B, occipital bone at birth ; a, tabular part, in which the four centres have become united into one, leaving' fissures between them ; b, b, condylar portions ; c, basilar portion. C, sphenoid bone at an early period, seen from above; 1, V, the greater wings ossified ; 2, 2', the lesser wings, in which the ossification has encircled the optic foramen, and a small suture is distinguishable at its posterior and inner side ; 3, two round granules of bones in the body below the sella turcica, the rest being cartilaginous. D, copied from Meckel (Archiv., vol. i., tab. vi., fig. 23), and stated to be from a foetus of six: months ; 2 , additional nuclei for the lesser wings ; 5, separate lateral processes of the body (lingular). The other indications are the same as in A. E, back part of the bone shown in A ; 4, internal pterygoid plates still separate. F, sphenoid at birth. The great wings are still separate. The presphenoid is now joined to the basisphenoid, and the internal pterygoid plates (not seen in the figure) are united to the external.

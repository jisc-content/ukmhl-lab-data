1 PREFACE. A distinct principle runs through this Edition of the Tablets, not quite manifest, perhaps, in this Part I., but which will be more apparent in Parts II. and III. The Authors have written for the medical student intending to become a practitioner. They have endeavoured to present the anatomy of the medical man* as distinct from, - but along with, - ihe anatomy of the scientist. The anatomy of the medical man the Authors take to be the anatomy that can be "seen and haudled " in the most matter-of-fact sense of the words, and so seen and handled by all. The anatomy the scientist has developed of late years is the anatomy that only the few can see and handle. The two forms of anatomy have been presented separately. No attempt has been made at the impossible and misleading task of fusing modern, or subjective anatomy, with the objective or dissectional anatomy d la Gray, d la Heath. a la Ellis. New facts,-or supposed facts, - not plainly discernible, - statements based upon a theory,-have been presented, not in the Tablets, but iu "Notes." If other avocations had permitted, the morphology of the osseous system would have been introduced in these Notes. It will be, it is hoped, in some subsequent Edition. * " Knife and forceps anatoni}- " (Mitchell Banks).

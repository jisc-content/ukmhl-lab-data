The figure here given embodies the old or classical descriptions of the shaft of the Fibula Up to the time of the last edition but one of " Quain " (1890), writers were endeavouring, under the influence of preconceived views, to describe only three surfaces to the shaft of the fibula, while there really are four; and, as it is natural under the circumstances, some set about the task in one way, and some in another. The Author's description, - published in the Tablets in 1872, - has doubtless been improved by the very correct and elegant figures on page 123, which have been reproduced by kind permission of the Editors of "Morris's Anatomy."

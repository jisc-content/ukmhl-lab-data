156 OSSIFICATION of the SPINE-lst Tablet. VERTEBRAE GENERALLY - Developed in cartilage from three primary centres, and five secondary ones. PRIMARY CENTRES:- TWO Lateral - For Lamtn^e, Processes, & Lateral Part op Body - In transverse processes ; 6th week. One Central*- For Central & Greater Part of Body - Centre of body; 8tl week. Ossification from central centres commences abont 9th or 10th dorsal vertebra, and proceeds along spine in both directions. Ossification from lateral centres commences at upper part of spine, and extends downwards. Portion of body formed from central centres diminishes, and portion formed from lateral centres increases from below upwards: - Bodies of sacral ver- tebrae are formed almost entirely, and bodies of lumbar vertebras to.but a slightly less extent, from central centres. In dorsal region ossification from lateral centres advances to just beyond costal facets. In cervical region the whole lateral portions,—projecting lip at each side of upper surface, & cor- responding concavity at each side of under surface,—are formed from lateral centres. The lamina are joined to each other during 1st year j the arches are joined to the body during 3rd year. SECONDARY CENTRES - For:- Tips of Spinous & Transverse Processes - One each, l6th year. - (The.J of each spinous process has sometimes two centres, but these are generalb more or less united). Upper & Under Surfaces Of Body -Two, - 21st year, - for two thin circular plates thickest at circumference, of which plates the upper one is the thickes These secondary centres join with remainder of the bone about 30th ye * See pp. 154 and 155,

(1, Gray; 2, Quain.) 1 By 4 secondary centres 2 {sometimes 1) for spinous process (16 years) By 2 additional centres for circular plates. A, foetal vertebra, showing the three primary centres ; 1, 2, neural ossifications ; 3, central ossification. B, dorsal vertebra from a child of two years ; 1 & 2 are seen to have encroached upon the body at *, the neuro-central synchondrosis, to have extended into the articular and transverse processes, and to have united behind in the spinous process, leaving- the ends cartilaginous. C, dorsal vertebra at about seventeen years, showing epiphyses on the transverse processes, 4 & 5, and spinous process, 6, and the upper epiphysial plate of the body, 7. D and E, parts of a lumbar vertebra of about the same age, showing, in addition to the foregoing, 8, the lower epiphysial

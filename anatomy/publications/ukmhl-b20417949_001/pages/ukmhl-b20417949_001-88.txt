78 LATERAL REGION of the SKULL. Presents from behind forwards the: Mastoid process ; Ext. auditory meatus ; Zygomatic arch & ramus oft/iejaw, which two latter arch over the temporal, zygomatic & spheno-maxillary fossee. TEMPORAL FOSSA Is formed by the temporal, frontal, & malar bones, the great wing of the sphenoid, & the anterior inferior angle of the parietal, and is deeply excavated below & in front. Is bounded above by the temporal ridge, and opens widely below into the zygomatic fossa, the boundary line between the two being the zygomatic arch & the pterygoid ridge. ZYGOMATIC FOSSA Is an irregular and imperfectly enclosed space, the incomplete walls of which are formed on the anterior, inner, upper & outer aspects respectively by the Tuberosity of the sup. maxillary bone, Ext. pterygoid plate, Under surface of great wing oj sphenoid as far as pterygoid ridge, and squamous portion of temporal bone. Zygomatic arch & ranms of lower jaw. Communicates with temporal fossa beneath the zygoma, and with the orbit & spheno- maxillary fossae through the spheno-maxillary & pterygo-maxillary fissures. SphenO-Maxillary Fissure - Is bounded by superior maxillary, great wing of sphenoid, malar & palate bones, aud joins internally at right angles with pterygo- maxillary fissure. Opens up communications between the orbit and the temporal, zygomatic & spheno-maxillary fossae. Transmits infraorbital artery, superior maxillary nerve & ascending or orbital branches of Meckel's ganglion. PterygO-Maxillary Fissure - Is comprised between pterygoid process & tuberosity of superior maxillary bone. Joins superiorly at right angles with spheno-maxillary fissure. Transmits internal maxillary artery from zygomatic to spheno-maxillary fossa. SPHENO-MAXILLARY FOSSA â€” Is the narrow & vertically elongated space comprised between the pterygoid process & the maxillary tuberosity, and bounded above & internally by the body of the sphenoid & the vertical plate of the palate bone. Its upper part is the point of meeting of the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary & pterygo- id axillary fissures. It communicates with the cranium, orbit, zygomatic & nasal fossae by the foramen rotun- dum & spheno- & pterygo-maxillary fissures & the sphenopalatine foramen, and has, opening into it, the vidian, pterygo-palatine, posterior palatine & accessory posterior palatine canals.

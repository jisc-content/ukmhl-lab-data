145 OSSIFICATION of the LONG BONES with ONE EPI- PHYSIS ONLY. CLAVICLE - Two centres, for Shaft - 5th week, before any other bone. The ossification commences before depo- sition of cartilage, but afterwards progresses in cartilage as well as in fibrous tissue. Sternal End - 18th or 20fch year. Joins with shaft about 25th year. METACARPAL & METATARSAL BONES & PHALANGES-Two centres, for Shaft - 8th or 9th week; a little later in phalanges of toes. Distal Extremity of Four Inner Metacarpals \ & Four Outer Metatabsals f 3rd to 8th year, or a little later Proximal Extremity of Phalanges, & of 1st ?in phalanges of toes. All these epiphyses unite with the shaft from 18th to 21st year. The first metacarpal & the first metatarsal have sometimes an additional epiphysis at their distal extremity (Allen Thomson). Fig. 159.â€”development of the clavicle. (Quain.) a, clavicle of a foetus at birth; osseous in the shaft, and cartilaginous at both ends. b, clavicle of a man about 23 years of age; the shaft (1) fully ossified at the acromial end ; the sternal epiphysis (2) is represented rather thicker than natural.

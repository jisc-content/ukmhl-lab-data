The carpus is entirely cartilaginous. Each of the metacarpal bones and digital phalanges has its shaft ossified. C, at the end of the first year ; the os magnum and unciform have begun to ossify. I), about the third year. Centres of ossification are seen in the pyramidal and in the proximal epiphysis of the first and the distal epiphyses of the other four metacarpal bones, and in the proximal epiphyses of the first row of phalanges. E, at the fifth year. Centres have been formed in the trapezium and later in the semilunar bone, and in the epiphyses of the middle and distal phalanges : (the figure does not show them distinctly in the middle phalanges). F, at about the ninth year. Centres have been formed in the scaphoid and trapezoid bones, and the more developed epiphyses of the metacarpal bones and pha- langes are shown in the first and second digits separately. 1, os magnum; 2, unciform; 3, pyramidal; 4, semilunar: 5, trapezium, 6, scaphoid; 7, trapezoid; 8, metacarpal bones, the principal pieces; 8*, four metacarpal epiphyses; 8', that of the thumb; 9, first phalanges; 9 , their epiphyses; 9', that of tlie thumb ; 10, second phalanges ; 10', epiphysis of terminal phalanx of thumb ; 11, terminal phalanges of the fingers ; 11", their epiphyses.

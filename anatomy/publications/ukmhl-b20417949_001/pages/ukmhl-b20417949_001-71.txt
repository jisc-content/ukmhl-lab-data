6J THE PALATE BONE—2nd Tablet. PTERYGOID PROCESS — Fits into the notch between the two plates of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and presents: Posterior Surface - Triangnlar, concave, forms part of pterygoid fossa. Two Lateral Surfaces - Rough, articulate with the two plates of the pterygoid proce=3 & with the superior maxilla. Under Surface - Forms part of the roof of the mouth, and presents the External & posterior small palatine foramina for external & posterior palatine nerves. ORBITAL PROCESS — Projects upwards & outwards from the anterior part of the upper border of the vertical plate, and presents : Three articular Surfaces - Anterior,posterior & internal, - which join respectively with the superior maxillary bone, the sphenoidal turbinated bone & the lateral mass of the ethmoid. TWO N ON-ARTICULAR SURFACES :- Superior or Orbital - Forms posterior part of floor of orbit; External or Spheno-maxillary - Forms part of inner wall of spheno-maxillary fossa, and is separated from the foregoing by a Rounded border, which forms part of spheno-maxillary fissure. SPHENOIDAL PROCESS — Curves upwards, backwards & inwards, and presents: Upper Surface - Articulates with sphenoid & sphenoidal turbinated bones, and assists in for- ming pterygopalatine canal. Outer Surface - Articulates behind with pterygoid process, and form3 in front that small part of inner wall of spheno-maxillary fossa, which lies behind spheno-palat. foramon Inxer Sub face - Concave, forms part of outer wall of nasal fossa.

160 OSSIFICATION of the SPINE-3rd Tablet. THE SACRUM - Thirty-five centres, which may be grouped as follows:- Fifteen Primary Centres - Namely, three for each of the five vertebrce, as follows: One For Body - 8th or 9th week in the three upper vertebrae, rather later in the two lower ones. Two for Laminae, Spinous, Posterior Transverse, & Articular Processes, and Small Portion of Body - 6th montll Twenty Secondary Centres - winch may be grouped as follows: - For Anterior Transverse Processes of the Three Upper Vertebrae - Three on each side, above & externally to anterior sacral foramina, 7th month. For Upper & Under Surfaces of Bodies - Two for each vertebra, 16th year. For Auricular Surfaces & Borders - Two on each side, 18th or 20th year. The bodies are at first separated by intervertebral discs. These begin to ossify from below upwards about 18th year. The bodies of the two first vertebrae, however, are not united before 25th year, or later. The lamina e° processes are joined to the bodies, and the several lateral masses to each other, also from below upwards, union taking place about 2nd year in the lower vertebrae, about 5th or 6th year in the upper ones. The two lateral plates join with remainder of the bone about 25th year. Sometimes there are separate centres for the anterior transverse processes of the two upper vertebrae only, the total number of centres being then reduced to thirty-three. THE COCCYX - The four coccygeal vertebrae are usually developed each of them from one centre, the first one sometimes from two; ossification commencing in the 1st vertebra - - about the time of birth ; 2nd „ - - from 5th to 10th year; 3rd „ a little before puberty; 4th „ a little after puberty. The three lower vertebrae join together before the middle of life; thi second one joins with the first at a later period ; and ultimately, especially in the male, the first vertebra may join with the sacrum. * Sometimes two in the upper two sacral vertebrae.

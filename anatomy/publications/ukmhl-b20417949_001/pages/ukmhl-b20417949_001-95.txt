Fig. 89.—principal "cranial points and links." (Quain.) CRANIAL TOPOGRAPHY. The first half of the important subject of cranio-cerebral topography may be briefly referred to here ; the brain-levels, and the lines of the cerebral fissures, sinuses, &c, will be taken in Part III. with the study of the brain. 1.—MEDIAN POINTS, FROM FRONT TO BACK. Alveolar Point (A.).—Centre of superior alveolar arch, or interval between central incisor teeth of upper jaw. Sttbnasal Point (S.).—The conjoined anterior nasal spines of the superior maxillae, or inferior mesial point of anterior aperture of nares. Nasion (N.).—Middle of fronto-nasal suture. Glabella (Gl.).—Most prominent point of nasal eminence. Opliryon (Op.).—Middle of line drawn across narrowest part of forehead and separating face from cranium. Bregma (Bg.)—Junction of coronal and sagittal sutures. Obelion (Ob.).—Region between the two parietal foramina, whera sagittal suture is simplest, and where its closure usually commences. Lambda (L.).—Junction of sagittal and lambdoid sutures. Occipital Point (0.).—Mediin point of occipital bone farthest removed from glabella. Inion (I.).—External occipital protuberance. Opisthion.—Middle of posterior margin of foramen magnum. Basion (B.).—Middle of anterior margin of foramen magnum. 2.-BILATERAL POINTS. Pterion (Ft.).—Point of meeting, near anterior part of temporal fossa, of frontal,

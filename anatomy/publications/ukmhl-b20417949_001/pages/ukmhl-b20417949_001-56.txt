46 THE ETHMOID BONE—2nd Tablet. LATERAL MASSES — Cuboid, and enclose a number of irregular cavities, the ethmoid cells, which are divided into an anterior & a posterior set. Their Anterior, Upper & Posterior Surfaces - P; esent numerous half-cells, which are completed respectively by articulation with Lachry?nal bones & nasal processes of superior maxilla, Frontal bone, Sphenoidal turbinated bones & orbital processes of palate bones. - The upper surface also presents two grooves which assist in forming the anterior & posterior ethmoidal foramina. Outer Surface - Presents a thin smooth plate of bone the os planum which forms inner wall of orbit, and articulates with : Lachrymal bone, in front; Orbital plate of frontal, above; Body of sphenoid, behind; Superior maxillary & orbital process of palate bone, below. Under Surface - Presents under surface of middle turbinated process and the projecting Unciform process, which articulates with inferior turbinated bone, and assists in forming inner wall of the antrum of Highmore. Inner Surface - Forms part of outer wall of nasal fossae, and presents from above down- wards the Superior turbinated process, small and corresponding to post, part of nasal fossae; Superior meatus, which communicates with posterior ethmoidal cells ; Middle turbinated process, which extends along whole length of lateral mass; Middle meatus, which communicates with the anterior ethmoidal cells (and through these with the frontal sinus) by means of a wide funnel-shaped , , ... , canal, the Infunaioulum.

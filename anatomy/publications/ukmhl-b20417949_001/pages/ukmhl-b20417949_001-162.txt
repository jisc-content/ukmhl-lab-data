152 OCCIPITAL BONE. At birth this bone consists of four portions, - the expanded tabular portion, whfS is ossified in membrane, the basilar portion, and the two condylar portions, which ? ossified in cartilage. The tabular portion is usually ossified from four centres, which appear about t 8th week and soon unite to form a plate of bone fissured above, below, and either side. The number of centres belonging to this portion varies, however, consider ably : sometimes there is but one centre; sometimes there are as many as ei«iit.' The basilar and the two condylar portions are each developed from alin^-le centn appearing a few days later. The tabular and condylar portions unite about the 4th year; the condylar am basilar portions, about the Gth year. The occipital joins with the sphenoid between the 18th and 20th years. PARIETAL BONE. One centre in parietal eminence, 7th or 8th week ; ossification gradually extends tc the periphery of the bone. The parietal bone is formed in membrane. ETHMOID BONE. Three centres:—One for each lateral mass, in the os planum about 4th or 5th month from which ossification extends into the turbinated processes. One for the perpendicular & horizontalplates-1st year. The three parts of the bone unite about beginning of »1 year. The ethmoid cells are formed about 4th or 5th year fc SPHENOID BONE. the ZT^^TS'~ the P°st-fPhenoi^ which includes the posterior part of the body the great wings, and the pterygoid processes ; - six for the pre-sthenoid which includes the anterior part of the body, the lesser wings, and the spC$ffiin«l Post-Sphenoid. - The eight centres, - four on each side, - are for:— fnv»);l GreferA wm& carnal pterygoid plates, - between foramen ovale & foramen rotundum, - 8th week.

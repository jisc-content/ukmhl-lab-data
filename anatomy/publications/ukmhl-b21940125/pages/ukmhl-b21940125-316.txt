C 27Â° 3 I am not acquainted with the symptoms which are produced by the formation of calculi in the pancreas. If the calculi should happen to be smooth, and few in number, they would probably occasion little pain or inconvenience. But if they should be rough upon their surface, and numerous, they would probably produce a good deal of irritation and pain in the pancreas, but it is not likely that we should be able to guess at the cause of the irritation, unless some of the calculi, having passed into the duodenum, should be evacuated by vomit- ing, or by stool.

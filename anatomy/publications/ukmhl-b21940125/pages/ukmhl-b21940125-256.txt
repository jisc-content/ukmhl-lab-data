This junction may either be general, over one extended surface of the liver, or it may consist of a number of processes of adhe- sion-: the adhesion is sometimes by a mem- brane of considerable length ; and some- times the adhesion is very close, the surface of the liver being immediately applied to the neighbouring parts. The surface of the liver, where these adhesions are most commonly found, is the anterior, by which it is joined to the peritonaeum lining the muscles at the upper part of the cavity of the abdomen. When an abscess is formed in the sub- stance of the liver, and points externally, these adhesions are of great use in prevent- ing the pus from escaping into the general cavity of the abdomen. Adhesions are also frequently found connecting the posterior surface of the liver to the stomach, and the duodenum ; and these may also be useful in

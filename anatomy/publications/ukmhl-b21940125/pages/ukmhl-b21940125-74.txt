r 2s 3 to be absorbed, and the tumour is thereby perceived externally. The absorption of the sternum and ribs goes on very gradual- ly, and is not accompanied with the forma- tion of pus. The tumour gradually in- creases in size, till perhaps it is as large as a child's head at birth ; the skin then be- comes in some measure dead, and cracks from distension at the highest point of the tumour, a portion of the coagulated blood is forced out by the impetus of the circulation, and the person is cut off instantaneously. The blood sometimes oozes out slowly, and the person sinks gradually under its loss. Aneurysms at the arch of the aorta, as well as in every other part of the arterial system, arise from the coats of the artery being previously diseased, which are there- by unable to resist sufficiently the impetus of blood that strikes against them. This is obvious, both from the diseased structure of the coats of an aneurysm itself, and of the artery in its neighbourhood.

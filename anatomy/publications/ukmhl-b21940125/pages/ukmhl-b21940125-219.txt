The peritonasal, muscidar, and internal coats are much thicker and harder than in a natural state. The muscular too is subdivided by membranous septa, and the internal coat is sometimes formed into hard irregular folds. It often happens that the surface of the inner membrane is ulcerated, producing cancer. Every vestige of the natural struc- ture is occasionally lost, and the gut appears changed into a gristly substance. When schirrus affects the gut, the passage at that part is always narrowed, and sometimes so much so as to be almost entirely obliterated. 1 he obliteration, or stricture, would some- times appear to be greater than in propor- tion to the thickness of the sides of the diseased gut: this, most probably, depends upon the contraction of the muscular fibres ot the-gut, which, although diseased, have not altogether lost their natural action. Where the passage is very much obstructed,

C 234 3 domen are thick, and the hydatids/'or their cysts are not distinct, but lie in contact with each other, making an irregular tu- mour, it will hardly be possible to form any accurate opinion by an examination. If the tumour be formed gradually, and the general health be little affected, it is pro- bable that it consists of hydatids. An ac- curate attention to the feeling, which the tumour yields upon pressure, or upon strik- ing it gently with the hand, may also assist in forming a probable conjecture about its nature. Where the tumour consists of hyda- tids, it will generally feel to a certain degree soft; and if the hydatids should be very large, there will probably be an obscure sense of fluctuation upon striking the tumour with one hand, while the other is applied to the opposite side of it. If, moreover, the tu- mour should occupy agreat part of the cavity of the abdomen, and can be clearly traced from the liver, as the source of its growth, there can be little doubt of the existence of hydatids under these circumstances.

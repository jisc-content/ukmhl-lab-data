C 3°° 3 from the bladder itself, it is still difficult, in some instances, to explain why they should be formed at all, and why they should ar- rive at so large a size. The last supposi- tion, however, seems to be the most reason- able, and I am persuaded it will apply to the greater number of cases where such cysts exist. Muscular Coat thickened. One of the most ordinary changes in the bladder, from its natural structure, is the great thickening of its muscular coat. In a natural state, the muscular coat of the blad- der (when it is moderately distended) con- sists of thin layers of muscular fibres, run- ning in different directions. These are pro- bably, altogether, not more than the eighth of an inch in thickness. 1 he muscular coat of the bladder, however, is occasionally found at least half an inch thick. 1 his arises from an additional quantity of muscle be- ing formed in consequence of extraordi- nary efforts being necessary in the bladder.

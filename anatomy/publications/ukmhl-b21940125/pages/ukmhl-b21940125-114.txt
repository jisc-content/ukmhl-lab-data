C 68 3 it is thinner, and resembles very much the pus from a common sore. In cutting into the substance of the lungs, a number of ab- scesses is sometimes found, from pretty large tubercles having advanced to a state of sup- puration. In the interstices between these tubercles, the lungs are frequently of a harder, firmer texture, with the cells in a great measure obliterated. The texture of the lungs on many occasions, however, round the boundaries of an abscess, is per- fectly natural. I have sometimes seen a number of small abscesses interspersed through the lungs, each of which was not larger than a pea. The pus in these is rather thicker than what arises from common inflammation, and re- sembles scrofulous pus. It is probable that these abscesses have been produced by a number of small scattered tubercles taking on the process of suppuration. The lungs immediately surrounding these abscesses are often of a perfectly healthy structure, none of the cells being closed up by adhesions.

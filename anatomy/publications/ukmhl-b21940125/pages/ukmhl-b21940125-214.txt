C iss 3 tenacity, and by the air which is formed. When the inflammation of the gut in a sack has not been very violent, and has ter- minated by resolution, it frequently leaves adhesions behind it, connecting the gut with the inner surface of the sack. It is perhaps possible too, that adhesions may be formed by long close contact, without inflammation. When the sack of a rupture has not been of long standing, it consists of a thin, firm, white, opaque,*membrane ; this is a pro- truded part of the peritonaeum, somewhat thickened by pressure.* When the sack has been of longstanding, it is often very thick, and evidently consists of a number of layers. The sack upon the inside has a very smooth surface, and the membrane which forms this surface can be readily traced into the peritonaeum, lining the cavity of the abdo- * In some cases of umbilical hernia, Dr. Marshall has observed no distinct appearance of peritonzal sack. This must have arisen from the peritonxum having burst, in consequence of distension, and its ruptured edges being lost by adhesion in the neighbouring parts.

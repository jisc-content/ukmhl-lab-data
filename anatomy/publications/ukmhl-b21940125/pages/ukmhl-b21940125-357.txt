Lime-water dissolves the urinary cal- culus, by digestion, in the proportion of four ounces of lime-water to twelve grains of the calculus. 9.

In the neck of the retort there was a brown subli- mate. Upon heating the retort thoroughly red hot, and then leaving it to cool, there was obtained a black coal, weighing twelve grains, which, when put upon red hot iron

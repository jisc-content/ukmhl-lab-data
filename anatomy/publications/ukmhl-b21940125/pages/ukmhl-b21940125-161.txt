[ ‚Äù5 ] fore being rendered incapable of these finer motions which it is reasonable to imagine must have considerable influence upon the voice. In the cases which I have had an opportunity of examining, the ligaments which join the cartilages together were natural in their structure ; had they b?en changed into bone, all the motions of the larynx would have been lost. It would then have been useless as the chief in- strument of voice; but what woukl be the exact effect of such a change upon sound generally, it is extremely difficult to deter- mine. In some instances where the carti- lages of the larynx have been converted into bone, there has occurred a total inabi- lity of swallowing, which destroyed the pa- tients. Upon examination after death, no disease was observable either in the pha- rynx or the oesophagus. How this should happen it is very difficult to explain, but it has been observed by Dr. Robertson, the Physician of Greenwich Hospital.

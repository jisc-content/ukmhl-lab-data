c >o rax and abdomen were entire in both cases, no opening whatever having been made into either, this effect could not arise from evaporation. Were this capable of taking place, the appearance here noticed, would be very usual in examining dead bodies and the internal parts generally would be affected by the influence of the same cause. It must be considered therefore as the effect of a process which was going on during life. The cause of this appearance is pro- bably a defect in the action of the exhalent vessels of the pericardium; so that the fluid which naturally lubricates this part, was not secreted in the proper quantity. There is nothing more difficult to conceive in this, than in a defect in the action of any other part of the body.

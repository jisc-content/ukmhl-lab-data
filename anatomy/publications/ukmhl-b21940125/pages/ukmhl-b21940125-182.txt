1136: an accurate inquiry into the history of the case. In dropsy of the ovarium the swell- ing is first perceived on the side of the lower part of the belly, and gradually in- creases afterwards, so as to occupy a great part of the cavity of the abdomen. As hy- datids most commonly grow from the liver, the swelling in this case will generally be first sensible at the upper part of the belly, and spread downwards. Hydatids, however, may be formed in any part of the abdomen, and therefore were they to begin to be formed at the side of the lower part of the belly, it seems hardly possible to distinguish ' / the one disease from the other.

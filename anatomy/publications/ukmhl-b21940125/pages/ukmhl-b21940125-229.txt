C l83 3 the anus of the earth worm opens by an oval aperture at the very extremity of the worm. The outer covering or skin in the lumbricus teres is less fleshy, and less strongly marked by transverse rugae, than in the earth worm. In the latter there is often to be seen a broad yellowish band, surrounding the body of the worm ; but in the lumbricus teres, this is entirely wanting. On each side of the lumbricus teres there is a longitudinal line very w'ell marked ; in the earth worm there are three longitudinal lines upon the upper half of its surface, but these are so faintly marked, as to be hardly observable. The lumbricus teres has no- thing corresponding to feet; whereas the earth worm has on its under surface, but more strongly marked towards its posterior extremity, a quadruple row of processes on each side, very sensible both to the eye, and the finger, which manifestly serve the pur- poses of feet in the locomotion of the animal. The internal structure of these two spe- cies of worms is also extremely different. .

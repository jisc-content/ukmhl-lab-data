c 186 3 a great many distinct portions, which are connected together so as to put on a jointed appearance ; these joints are commonly of a very white colour, but are occasionally brownish, which depends on a fluid of this colour that is found in their vessels. The worm is usually very long, extending often many yards, and seldom passes entire from the bowels. This circumstance has pre- vented the extremities of the taenia from being often seen. The head of this taenia is somewhat of a square form, with a narrowed projection forwards ; in the middle of this projecting part, there is a distinct circular aperture, around the edge of which grow curved sharp processes. Near the angles of the square edge of the head, are situated four round projecting apertures, at equal dis- tances from each other: this head is placed upon a narrow jointed portion of the worm, of considerable length,and which gradually spreads itself into the broader joints, of which the body of the worm is composed.

The examples of this appear- ance which it has occurred to me to observe, have been chiefly in preparations, and had undoubtedly taken place after death. In order that the circulation may be carried on, it is necessary that the cavities of the heart be free for the transmission of blood; and if any one of its cavities should be plugged up, the circulation would necessarily be stopped altogether. A polypus, however, plugs up the cavity of the heart in which it is form- ed so entirely, as to prevent the circulation. It may be said, perhaps, that polypi are formed gradually, and the circulation is carried on for some time, although very imperfectly. We have no general evidence, however, of coagula of blood being formed in the ordinary circulation, where there is a healthy structure of the parts concerned in this function. When polypi are examined, there is the same sort of appearance through- put their whole substance; which shews that

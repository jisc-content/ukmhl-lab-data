C M2 U there must be added a considerable predis- position of the parts towards this disease. Hence, when there is no previous disposi- tion, the stomach does not become affected with this disease, whatever be the intempe- rance. When, however, there is a previous disposition, there is reason to think that it is encouraged and brought forwards by this kind of excess. Schirrus sometimes extends over almost every part of the stomach, but most com- monly it attacks one part. The part which is affected with schirrus has sometimes no very distinct limit between it and the sound structure of the stomach, but most com- monly the limit is very well marked. When schirrus attacks a portion of the stomach only, it is generally towards the pylorus. The principal reason of this probably is, that there is more of glandular structure in that part of the stomach than in any other: and it would appear that glandular parts of the body are more liable to be affected with schirrus, than parts of the body generally.

C 304 1 chambers by a firm membranous substance, and the aperture of communication was al- most obliterated. There seem to me to be only two ways in which a division of the bladder into two chambers can happen. The one is by a morbid growth of the inner membrane, forming a ridge at some particular part, and at length by a continuation of this process, making a septum more or less complete in the bladder. I have seen the cavity of the oesophagus very much narrowed at one part by a permanent ridge being formed in its inner membrane. Something of the same kind 1 have also seen in a part of the small intestines. We may therefore readily admit the possibility of a similar process taking place in the inner membrane of the bladder. Another way in which the bladder may be supposed capable of being divided into two chambers, is a very strong contraction or its transverse muscular fibres at some particular part. This will be analogous to the hour-glass contraction of the uterus

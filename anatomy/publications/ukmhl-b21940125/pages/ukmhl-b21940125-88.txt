C 42 3 SYMPTOMS. The symptoms which attend inflamma- tion of the heart are very much the same with those which belong to inflammation of the pericardium, viz. the general affec- tion of the system called fever ; pain in the situation of the heart; palpitations; an ir- regular pulse; cough; difficulty of breath- ing; and often syncope. It would seem probable that the last symptom is princi- pally connected with inflammation of the substance of the heart, and perhaps it may not be found in a pure inflammation of the pericardium. The two diseases, however, are very commonly blended together. The symptoms which attend aneurysm of the heart, are the same which belong to aneurysm of the arch of the aorta.

C 349 3 Loose Cartilages in the Tunica Vaginalis Testis. Small cartilages are sometimes found loose in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis, as in some of the joints in the body, more especially the knee joint. They do not however occur in the former so fre- quently as in the latter. They must once have been attached to some part of the in- ner surface of the tunica vaginalis testis, by very small processes or peduncles, and by the motion of this tunic upon the tes- ticle they must have been separated. They afterwards continue to lie loose in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis, and are, I believe, attended with no incon- venience. An example of this kind has been seen by myself, and it has not unfre- quently been observed by others. Adhesions. The tunica vaginalis is frequently found adhering to the surface of the testicle.

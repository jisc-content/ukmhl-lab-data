[ 99 3 mediately under the pharynx, or near the cardia. Any substance capable of irritating the inner membrane of the oesophagus, by hav- ing sharp hard projections, will doubtless be more likely to affect the oesophagus, where it first enters into it. In an oesopha- gus, therefore, predisposed to schirrus, such an accident may prove an exciting cause, and the disease will more frequently take place at its upper end. At the cardia too, there is a peculiar arrangement of the muscular fibres, which are capable of act- ing in some degree like a sphincter, and which probably produce on many occasions a narrowness of the canal there. This will lendei the oesophagus at the cardia more liable to be injured by the passage of any hard substance, and may ultimately lay the foundation of a schirrous ulcer. This is the account which the late Dr. Hunter used to give of the frequent situation of ulcers at the upper and lower extremities of the oeso- phagus, and it seems to have great weight.

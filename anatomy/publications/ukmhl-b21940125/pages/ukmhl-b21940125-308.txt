The symptoms which have been describ- ed as belonging to inflammation of the sub- stance of the spleen, are a fulness and sense of pain in the left hypochondrium. The pain is increased upon pressure, and there is also that general affection of the system, called symptomatic fever. In two cases of inflamed spleen, examined by the late Dr. Hunter, where the inflammation had advanced to suppuration, the patients could not define accurately the seat of their pain, but the pain seemed to travel a good deal over the general cavity of the abdomen. It is worth while to ascertain whether this circumstance is common in inflammation of the spleen; but as the disease occurs rarely, it will be some considerable time before we shall arrive satisfactorily at this knowledge.

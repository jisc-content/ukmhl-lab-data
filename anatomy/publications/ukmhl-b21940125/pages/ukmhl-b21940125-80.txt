L 34. 3 Blood in the Pericardium, without a Rupture of the Heart. Cases have occurred, although very rare- ly, in which a large quantity of blood has been accumulated in the cavity of the peri- cardium, but where no rupture could be dis- covered afterthe most diligent search, either in the heart itself, or in any of its vessels. This appears very wonderful, and not at all what any person would expect a priori. Upon the supposition of there being no rupture, two conjectures only have occurred to me about the possibility of such an effect taking place, and they are both attended with considerable difficulty. The one is, that the vessels upon the sur- face of the heart, may have lost a part of the compactness of their texture, so that the blood may have escaped through their coats by transudation. The other is, that blood may have been thrown out by the extremi- ties of the small vessels opening upon the surface, of that portion chiefly of the peri-

It sometimes amounts only to a few ounces, and occasionally to many pints. When the quantity of water is very considerable, the fornix is raised at its an- terior extremity in consequence of its accu- mulation, and an immediate opening of com- munication is thereby formed between the lateral ventricles.-^ From this cause too a # Mr. Home has known an instance where water was accumulated in large quantity in the third ven- tricle, and had forced its way between the fine laminas of the medullary substance which compose the septum lucidum, without escaping into either of the lateral ventricles. This may be said to be a new situation of hydrocephalus, and is of very rare occurrence. t A distinguished author has, in a late publication, insisted very strongly upon the existence of a communi- cation between the two lateral ventricles of the brain, and has expressed great surprise that it has been denied by several teachers of anatomy in London. Without entering into any dispute about this matter, which in itself is of no great importance, I shall briefly mention

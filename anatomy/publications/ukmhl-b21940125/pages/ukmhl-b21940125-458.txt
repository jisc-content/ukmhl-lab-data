C 4*Â« 3 have known adhesions formed between them and the neighbouring parts. These must have rendered the reduction of the uterus and vagina into their natural situa^- tion very difficult, and perhaps, till the adhesions were a good deal elongated, im-r possible. The Vagina very short. The vagina is sometimes very short. I have seen it, I should believe, shorter than half its natural length. This is an original defect in the formation, can only be ascer- tained by an examination, and is but very little capable of being remedied. The Vagina widened. The vagina is sometimes very much stretched or widened by large tumours which are lodged in it: these are chiefly polypi; and when they have been removed by art, the vagina, if it has not been for a long time stretched, recovers nearly its na^ tural size.

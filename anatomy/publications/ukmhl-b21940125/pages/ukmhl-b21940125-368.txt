C 322 1 The symptoms which attend calculi in the bladder are well known. There is an uneasy sensation at the orifice of the ure- thra after making water, or after exercise. When the calculus is large, a dull pain is generally felt at the neck of the bladder. The attempts to make water are frequent, and it often passes drop by drop, or the stream is suddenly interrupted. T. he urine deposits a large proportion of a mucous sediment, which is produced by the mucous glands at the neck of the bladder being irritated by the calculus to an increased secretion. The urine is also occasionally tinged with blood, from some small blood vessel being ruptured by a rough part of the stone, and this is most apt to happen after some jolting motion. There is tenes- mus, in consequence of the connection of the rectum with the bladder, and the sym- pathy which has been established between their respective functions.

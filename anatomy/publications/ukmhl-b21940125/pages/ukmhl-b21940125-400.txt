C 354 1 Testicle bony. The testicle is sometimes converted into bone. A few instances only of this disease have fallen under my observation, and in them the bony process had not extended over the whole substance of the testicle, but had affected it partially. A Cyst adhering to a Testicle containing a. Vena Medmensis. I have seen a testicle with a small firm cyst adhering to it, which contained a worm of that sort called vena medinensis. This is a worm of considerable length, with a smooth surface, and an uniform appear- ance; at the posterior extremity it termi- nates in a slender hook-like process, and at the anterior, there is a rounded opening or mouth. This testicle had probably be- longed to a man who had visited some of those climates in which the vena medi- nensis is found, and who had brought it over with him to this country.

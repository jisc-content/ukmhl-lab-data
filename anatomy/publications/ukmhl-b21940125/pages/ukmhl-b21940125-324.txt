C 278 3 fallen two or three times under my obser- > vation. Hydatids of the Kidneys. The formation of hydatids is not an un-^ common disease in the kidneys. There are sometimes one or two considerable hyda-? tids on the surface of the kidney, lying be- tween its substance and capsule; at other times, they are much more numerous. These hydatids do not appear to be of the same nature with the hydatids of the liver: they are not inclosed in firm cysts ; theii coats are also thinner, and less pulpy, and not uncommonly they are almost as thin as any membrane of the body. I do not recollect to have seen any instance of small hydatids of this sort attached to the coats of larger hydatids in the kindney, as may be frequently observed in the liver. It is therefore probable, that the hydatids which are commonly found in the kidney, depend on a diseased alteration of the structure of this organ, and are not distinct organized simple animals.

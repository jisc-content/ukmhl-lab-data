C 23 3 the whole coagulum had been formed at the same time. Both of those circumstances seem to contradict very strongly the opi- nion, that polypi are formed during life. When polypi are formed, I believe that the coagulation of the blood does not take place very quickly after death. They are without any admixture of the red globules of blood, and therefore the blood has been sufficient- ly long in coagulating to allow the glo- bules to separate from the other parts, in consequence of their greater specific gra- vity. The ordinary coagulations of the blood, which commonly do not fill up very fully the cavities of the heart (although instances occasionally occur of this sort) take place pretty soon after death, because the red particles of the blood are generally arrested in the coagulum. It may be worth while to remark, that there is sometimes found a portion of a coagulum in one of the ven- tricles of a yellow colour, and with an oily appearance, so as to resemble exactly fat.

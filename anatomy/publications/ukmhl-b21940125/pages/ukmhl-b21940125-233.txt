C l87 3 The body of the taenia consists of thin, flat, pretty long joints, on one edge of whichâ€˜there is a projection, with a very obvious aperture. In the same worm some of these joints appear considerably longer than others ; this probably depends on one joint being contracted, while another is relaxed. The apertures which we have just mentioned are generally placed on the alternate edges of the contiguous joints : but this is not uniformly the case; they are sometimes placed on the same edges of two, or even several contiguous joints. When these joints are examined attentive- ly, there are frequently seen, in each of them, vessels filled with a brownish fluid, pnddisposed in an arborescent form. Around the edges of each joint, there is also a dis- tinct serpentine canal.* The last joint of a taenia resembles very much a common joint * This, as well as the vessels disposed in an arbo- rescent form, is very distinctly seen injected in some preparations which have been made, and given to me by an ingenious young surgeon, Mr. Carlisle.

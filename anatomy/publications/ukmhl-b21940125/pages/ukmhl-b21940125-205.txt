Thus ulcers are very rare in the inner membrane of the trachea or the urethra, but very common in the inner membrane both of the great and the small intestines. It is difficult to assign a satisfactory reason for this difference. It probably, however, depends upon the dif- ferent structures and functions of these parts. I here is a good deal of resemblance between the structure of the inner mem- brane of the trachea and the urethra. The secretion of the one, likewise, is not very different from that of the other. The inner membrane of the intestines has a structure and secretion peculiar to itself. It is pro- bable that upon these circumstances de- pends its greater disposition to ulcerate ; but it is very difficult to explain how this should be the case.

C 3Â°9 3 laminae, for instance, are perfectly white, while the other laminae are brown. In this sort of mixture, I have most commonly found the white laminae on the outside, and the brown laminae in the middle; and I do not recollect seeing one instance of laminae of different colours, disposed in alternate strata. The specific gravity of urinary calculi differs very considerably, as they differ a good deal in their compactness; but they are generally a little more than twice the specific gravity of water. The chemical properties of different uri- nary calculi, I am apt to believe, differ more from each other than has generally been imagined. Any trials which I have made have led me to this opinion; but I am so lit- tle accustomed to chemical experiments that I do not rest upon it with much confidence. 1 he celebrated Scheele made a number of experiments to ascertain the nature of urinary calculi, of which the following are the chief.

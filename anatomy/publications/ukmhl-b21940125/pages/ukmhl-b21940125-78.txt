C 32 U the valves which are situated at the origin of the two large arteries, but by no means so frequently. What this depends upon, it is very difficult to determine. These valves may perhaps be considered as belonging more to the venal than the arterial system, and it is certain that ossification takes place very seldom in veins, although very often in arteries. The same Valves thick and opaque. The valvular apparatus between the au- ricles and ventricles, is also occasionally thickened, having lost all its transparency, and having an opaque white colour. 1 he chordse tendineae likewise become thicker than natural; and the internal membrane lining the ventricles, is frequently at the same time a good deal thickened, appeal- ing like a firm white membrane. Under such circumstances the heart is often found to be considerably enlarged beyond its usual size. I have also seen the valvular appa- ratus between the auricle and the ventricle.

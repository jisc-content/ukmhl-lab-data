C *9 H 1 have also found very frequently, diseas- ed appearances in the arch of the aorta, which were not advanced far enough to produce aneurysm. These consist in little white opaque spots being formed in the inner membrane of the artery, and its coats are more easily separable from each other than in the healthy state. The reason why aneurysms take place more frequently in the arch of the aorta, than in any other part of the arterial sys- tem, is its curvature, which exposes it to the full impetus of the blood propelled by the strength of the left ventricle. Aneurysms hardly ever happen in the pulmonary ar- tery, because there is no arch formed by the pulmonary artery, and the blood readily passes by two large branches into the sub- stance of the lungs. It may be not impro- bable too, that the pulmonary artery may be less liable than the aorta to those diseased alterations of structure, upon which aneu- rysm ultimately depends.

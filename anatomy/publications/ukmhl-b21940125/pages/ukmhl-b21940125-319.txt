C 273 D matter. These abscesses generally first de-* stroy the mamillary portion of the kidney; and when they advance very far, they de- stroy almost the whole structure of the kidney, converting it into capsules which surround a number of imperfect cavities that are lined with this pulpy substance. The capsule into which a kidney is changed by the progress of this disease, is on some occasions thicker than on others, frequently of considerable hardness, and seems sometimes to be slightly laminated. When a kidney is so affected, it is not un- common for the pelvis and ureter to par- take of the disease, and a calculus is often found either in the abscess, or in the pelvis of the ureter.* * In such cases, it is very probable that the calculus is the immediate cause of the other disease, the consti- tution being at the same time disposed to it. By the irritation of the calculus, inflammation and suppuration are produced in the kidney, and these partake of the nature of the constitution. T

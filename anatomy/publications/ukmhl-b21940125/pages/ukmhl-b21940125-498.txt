Mal-jormations of the Brain. These are the principal diseased changes which take place in the brain, and its ap- pendages. I have just to add, that the brain is subject to great variety from ori- ginal monstrous formation. A great part of what is usually called the cerebrum is sometimes wanting, while the cerebellum, and the medulla spinalis are entire ; some- * I have seen an instance of a considerable tumour being formed in a nerve. The tumour was very solid in its texture, of a yellowish white colour, and larger in its size than a goose’s egg. The nerve seemed to be in some measure lost in the tumour, and in one part of it could be observed pretty distinctly a fibrous structure, similar to that of a nerve. This swelling occurred in one of the axillary nerves, and was extirpated by Mr* Home, at St. George’s Hospital.

C 3Â°7 3 X 2 they are of a small size, they are sometimes lodged in pouches, or sacculi, formed by the protrusion of the inner membrane of the bladder between the fasciculi of its muscular fibres. A calculus also is occa- sionally attached to an excrescence of the bladder, so as to be kept in a fixed situation. There is frequently one calculus only in the bladder at a time, and then it is usually of an oval form ; but there are often more, and the calculi by rubbing upon each other acquire flat sides and angles. Calculi have sometimes a smooth uniform surface, but most frequently the surface is granulated. These granules are commonly placed very near each other over the whole surface of the calculus, giving it a certain degree of roughness. They are, however, occasion- ally gathered into clusters on particular parts of the surface of a calculus. These granules are sometimes of a smaller, and sometimes of a larger size, and in different calculi are more or less elevated. Some calculi have an irregular porous structure

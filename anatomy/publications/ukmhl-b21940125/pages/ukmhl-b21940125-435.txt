Schirrus is a disease which sometimes attacks the ovaria, although seldom in com- parison of its attacking the uterus. Un- der such circumstances the ovaria become enlarged, and are converted into a whitish hard mass, which is more or less inter- sected with membranous septa.

The bony substance into which they are converted has some- times a greater admixture of earth than th$ natural bones of the body.

I 441 1 some trials which I have made, it partly coagulated upon the application of the com- mon acids, exactly like the water in hy- drothorax and ascites, or like the serum of the blood. But there is much variety in the quantity of the coagulable matter. I11 some instances the water in hydrocephalus contains a very small proportion of coagu- lable matter, and in others it is almost en- tirely free from it. This variety may pro- bably depend upon some difference in the action of the small blood-vessels which pour the fluid out. When water is accumulated in the ven- tricles to a very large quantity, the sub- stance of the brain, especially upon the sides and at the upper surface, appears almost to be a sort of pulpy bag, containing a fluid. The scull too upon such occasions is very much enlarged in size, and altered in its shape. The cranium is exceedingly large in proportion to the size of the face. The pro- jections are very considerable at the centres of ossification, from whence the frontal, pa-

C 310 ] 1. Diluted vitriolic acid does not act on urinary calculi at all, but the concentrated dissolves them in heat. 2. Marine acid, whether diluted or con- centrated, does not act on urinary calculi, not even when boiled with them.* 3. Nitrous acid diluted, or aqua fortis, act a little on urinary calculi in the cold, but on the application of heat act with efferves- cence and with vapours. 4. This solution tinges the skin with deep red spots within half an hour after being applied, is not precipitated by alkalis, but on the application of lime-water yields a white precipitate. 5. Ponderous earth dissolved in marine acid, does not occasion any precipitate from this solution. 6. Acid of sugar, or salt of sorrel, does not produce any precipitate from this solu- tion. * I have met with an urinary calculus capable of being dissolved in marine acid, even in the common tempera- ture of the atmosphere.

C 356 3 Testicles very small> and wasted. The testicles are sometimes exceedingly small in their size. I have known one case, in a person of middle age, where each of them was not larger than the extremity of the finger of an adult. This, as appeared from its history, arose from a fault in the original formation, and was attended with a total want of the natural propensities. It is much more common for a testicle to waste either spontaneously, or in conse- quence of a former inflammation, or com- pression, so as gradually to disappear en- tirely.* When this takes place in one tes- ticle only, the natural powers are preserved; but when it takes place in both, they must be altogether lost. Sometimes one testicle, and sometimes both, remain in the cavity of the abdomen through life, so that a person appears to have only one testicle, or to be without them * Sec Hunter orv the Venereal Disease, P- *Â°9-

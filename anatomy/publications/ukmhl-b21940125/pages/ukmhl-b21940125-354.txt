C 3Â°8 3 upon the surface, instead of being granu- lated. Calculi when divided by the saw, or bro- ken, exhibit most commonly a laminated structure. These laminae are disposed in concentric curves, and are applied together with more or less compactness: in some calculi the lamina adhere together very slightly. They differ in their thickness in different calculi: and the laminated struc- ture sometimes pervades uniformly the whole mass of the calculus ; while at other times different portions of it are interrupted by a coarse porous texture. In some calculi no laminated structure whatever is obser- vable, but it is entirely porous. The colour of calculi varies considerably. They are most frequently of a brown co- lour, which is sometimes of a lighter, and sometimes of a darker shade, ihey aia also sometimes of a white, and often of a yellowish colour. It is remarkable, that different portions of the same calculus are frequently of a different colour. Some

C 92 3 tion, it appears probable, that the vessels of the inner membrane of the trachea possess a power of separating the coagulable lymph from the blood, and that this disease con- sists in a peculiar action of these vessels. The trachea is sometimes filled with a solid substance, of the same kind witli what we have described. Of this I have only seen one instance, and it occurs, I believe, much more rarely than the other. The tubular substances which are thrown out from the trachea in coughing, and which constitute the most ordinary form of polypus, were considered formerly, by some anato- mists of distinguished reputation, as blood vessels. It is singular that they should have / paid so little attention to the appearance of these tubular substances as to have mistaken them for blood vessels; and it is still more singular, that it should never have occurred to their reflection, that blood vessels of such a size could not be coughed up, without a very large quantity of blood passing up along with them.

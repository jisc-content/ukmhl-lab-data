C 2Â« 3 with a thick white opaque membrane. There was hardly contained in it any coa- gulated blood ; but the quantity of the coa- gulated blood depends commonly on the size of the bag. This disease most probably arose from the muscular structure at the apex of the ventricle becoming weaker than in any other part, so that when the ventricle con- tracted upon the blood, it was pushed against the weakened part, which was not fully able to resist its impetus, and therefore was gradually dilated. Had the strength of the apex of the left ventricle been in due proportion to that of the other parts, it would seem impossible that the aneu- rysmal swelling should ever have taken place. Aneurysm of the Arch of the Aorta. The most frequent situation of aneurysm within the cavity of the thorax, is at the arch of the aorta. In this disease the arch of the aorta is much enlarged beyond its usual size, sometimes forming an uniform

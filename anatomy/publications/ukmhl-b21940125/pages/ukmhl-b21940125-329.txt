C a83 1 the ureter is then enlarged, but the ureter itself. I have seen the ureters of both kid- neys enlarged from this cause to twice or thrice their natural size. Whatever be the nature of the obstruc- tion, if the pelvis of the ureter be very much enlarged from the accumulation of the urine, the cavity of the kidney is at the same time enlarged. As this process advances, the substance of the kidney becomes more and more compressed, and its cavity be- comes enlarged in proportion. The sub- stance of the kidney is, at length, in a great measure lost, and is converted into a cap- sule, containing a great many cells, which communicate with each other. The cap- sule is sometimes very thin, and the whole mass is a great deal larger than the natu- ral size of a healthy kidney. It is worthy of remark, that the urine is secreted even when the natural structure of the kidney is almost entirely lost. This is both seen in the derangement of the kidneys now under consideration, and when they are converted

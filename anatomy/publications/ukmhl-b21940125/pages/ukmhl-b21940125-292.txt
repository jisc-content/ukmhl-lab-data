/ L D Bile. The bile in the gall-bladder is found to differ in different bodies; but this is too common to arise from disease, and must de- pend on natural circumstances. It is some- times of a green, at other times of a brown- ish yellow, or a purer yellow colour. The brownish yellow colour is the most com- mon. It is always more or less viscid, and the variety in this respect is considerable : in man it generally appears a good deal more viscid than in most other classes of animals. In one case, I have seen it as ropy as the mucus which is commonly coughed up from the trachea. I recollect also another case, where the bile in the gall-bladder resembled exactly the white of substance on the outside, and of white radiated lamellx upon the inside, was analyzed some time ago by Dr. Saunders. It was found to consist of a resinous matter, with a small proportion of earth, apparently the calca- reous, and some mineral and volatile alkali.â€”See p. IJQ. first edition.

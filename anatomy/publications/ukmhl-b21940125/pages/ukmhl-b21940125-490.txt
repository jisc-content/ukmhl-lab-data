C 444 3 the effusion is in consequence of external violence. The quantity of blood which is effused from the rupture of vessels in the brain is fre- quently very considerable. It is commonly found in a coagulated state, and the texture of the brain in the neighbourhood is often very much hurt from the pressure. Blood is not equally liable to be effused into every part of the substance of the brain. Where an effusion has taken place without external injury, it is almost constantly found in the medullary part of one of the hemispheres, and often near the lateral ventricles, so that a quantity of blood has at the same time escaped into one or both of these cavities. It sometimes happens that the brain is very soft in its consistence at the place of this effusion, a remark which has been made by Dr. John Hunter. When blood is extravasated within the cavity of the cranium from some external injury, the vascular system is usually sound, except for the rupture which may have

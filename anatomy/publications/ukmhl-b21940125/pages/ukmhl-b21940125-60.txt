C >4 3 upon removing the sternum and the carti- *t * laginous extremities of the ribs. The ex- ternal surface of the different cavities and blood vessels of the heart is seen as dis- tinctly as when the pericardium is laid open in the natural structure of these parts. A close and uniform adhesion of the peri- cardium to the heart has sometimes been mistaken for this malformation, but they are very different from each other. When there is a close adhesion of the pericardium to the heart, the external surface of the dif- ferent cavities and blood vessels of this or- gan does not come into view, upon removing the sternum and a part of the ribs. The whole of this appearance is as completely hid as in the healthy structure. It is only when the adhesion is removed by dissection that the external surface of the heart and its blood vessels comes into view. When there is an adhesion of the pericardium to the heart, this membrane adheres at the same time closely to the tendinous part of the diaphragm ; but when there is an original

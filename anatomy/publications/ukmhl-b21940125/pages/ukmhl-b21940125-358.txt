C 3la 3 in the open air, retained its black colour. The sublimate, which seemed to have been somewhat fused, weighed twenty-eight grains ; and upon being purified by a new sublimation, it grew white. It had no smell, but a somewhat sourish taste, and was easily soluble in boiling water: it also dissolved in spirit of wine, but a larger quantity than of water was requisite for this purpose. Lime- water was not precipitated. The sublimate seemed to agree in some respects with the sal succini. From these and some other experiments Scheele concludes, that urinary calculi are neither gypseous nor calcareous, but consist of an oily, dry, volatile, acid concrete, mix- ed with some gelatinous matter. Bergman, by burning the charcoal of urinary calculi to a white cinder, obtained some calcareous earth, and calculates that the proportion of it in these stones is about lio Part- observations he himself con- siders as supplemental to those of Scheele, and they are well worthy of attention.

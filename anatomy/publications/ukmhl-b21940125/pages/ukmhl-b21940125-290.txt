C 244 H All the gall-stones which I have exa- mined dissolve in the nitrous acid. They are separated into a fine black powder when put into the vitriolic acid, especially if ex- posed to a sand heat. By the marine acid they are not acted upon at all in the com- mon heat of the atmosphere ; and are even but little affected by it when exposed to a sand heat for a considerable time. Most of the gall-stones which I have exa- mined, are either not very soluble in oil of turpentine, in the common heat of the at- mosphere, or the process goes on very slowly : one sort I have found to be in this heat altogether insoluble. When put into this oil, and exposed to a sand heat, they are much more readily acted upon. Some are converted into a kind of oil, which sinks to the bottom of the oil of turpentine; others are partly soluble, tinging the oil of bitter taste, and arc soluble in water. In some trials which I made they did not dissolve in distilled water, either cold or hot; but they are bitter to the taste, and without any regular shape, or appearance ol crys..il ization.

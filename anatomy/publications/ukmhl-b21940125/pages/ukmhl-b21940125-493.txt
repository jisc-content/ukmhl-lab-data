[ 447 ] is not repaired, and a cavity remains after- wards filled with a serous fluid.* Aneurysm of the internal Carotid Arteries or the Side of the Sella Turcica. The internal carotid arteries are very apt, in persons of an advanced age, to become ossified, and the same morbid change may be traced along their branches. It occurs, however, very rarely that they are distended at any part into an aneurysmal sack, like the arteries in some other parts of the body. I have been informed of an instance of this kind, where both the internal carotid arteiies, on the side of the sella turcica, were distended into a little aneurysm.f * I had an opportunity of observing, lately, a well marked case of this sort, in a person who had had se- veral attacks ot apoplexy, and at length was cut off by one of them. Dr. John Hunter has observed a good many instances ot it, and a case occurred some years ago to Mr. Wilson, lecturer on surgery, whose ana- tomical accuracy is well known, where the cavity which remained was of a very large size. + I owe my acquaintance with this case to Dr. Blane.

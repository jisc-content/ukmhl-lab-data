L 43 1 The chief symptom which attends aneu- rysm of the arch of the aorta, in an early stage of the disease, is a strong pulsation to be felt in the chest. The pulsation is com- monly at the same time visible to the eye, when the chest is exposed to view. We are not to conclude, however, from this symp- tom only, that there is certainly an aneu- rysm. I have felt the same kind of pulsa- tion in other cases ; as for instance, where the pericardium was found strongly to ad- here to the heart; where there was a slight inflammation upon the surface of the heart, with a little more water than usual in the pericardium ; and where a morbid enlarge- ment had taken place in the heart without any aneurysmal swelling. But when an aneurysm of the arch of the aorta has ad- vanced to a large size, a tumour begins to be formed externally, accompanied with a strong pulsation. This I believe belongs only to aneurysm, and becomes the most decided characteristic of this disease. The pulse at the wrist in aneurysm of the arch

The origin and real nature of these hy- datids are not fully ascertained ; 'it is ex- tremely probable, however, that they are a sort of imperfect animalcules. There is no doubt at all, that the hydatids in the livers of sheep are animalcules: they have been often seen to move when taken out of the liver, and put into warm water; and they retain this power of motion, for a good many hours after a sheep has been killed. The analogy is great between hydatids in the liver of a sheep, and in that of the hu- man subject.

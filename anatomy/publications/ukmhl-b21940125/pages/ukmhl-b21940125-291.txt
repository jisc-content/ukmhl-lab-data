Most gall-stones appear not to be readily affected by spirit ofwine in the common heat of the atmosphere, but are either partly or entirely soluble in it in a boiling heat.* Such are the general results from a good many trials of my own; but I speak upon this subject with very little confidence. It ought to be taken up by an able chemist, who is much in the-habit of making ex- periments, and his experiments should ex- tend to a great variety of gall-stones, which differ from each other in their appearance.-'!'- * When some biliary calculi are exposed to spirit of wine in a boiling state, white flaky crystals are soon formed upon its cooling. When they are exposed to spirit of wine in the common heat of the atmosphere, it is some weeks before crystals begin to be formed, and they appear to be more pointed in their shape than the former. These crystals were, I believe, first observed by M. Poulletier de la Salle. See Elemens dâ€™Histoire Naturelle et de Chimie, par M. de Fourcroy, Tom.

c ns: When ulcers have taken place in the ca- vity of the larynx, there is a fixed pain in the situation of this organ, difficulty of breathing, and the patient can only speak in a whisper. There is also symptomatic fever. The symptoms which attend catarrh are too generally known to require being men- tioned. When there is a sense of soreness in this disease, passing down the middle of the chest, it arises from a considerable in- flammation of the inner membrane of the trachea. This inflammation soon goes or!, but the increased secretion from the glands of the trachea often remains for a good while afterwards. The inflammation of the inner membrane of the trachea, which is sometimes to be found in consumptive patients, continues I believe for a much longer time than in ca- tarrh, and may be said to be chronic.

C 281 3 Calculi of the Kidneys. The formation of calculi is not peculiar to the kidneys, but it is a more frequent disease in them than in any other part of the body. Small granules of stone are sometimes found in the tubular portion of the kidneys, which may either be attended or not with inflammation. But it is more common to And a calculus of considerable size lodged either in some part of the sub- stance of the kidney, or in the pelvis of the ureter. The last situation is by much the most frequent. When a stone in this situation is so large as not to be capable of passing through the ureter, it is afterwards gradu- ally increased in size, from the contact of the urine. In its growth, it necessarily follows the branches of the pelvis, which are called infundibula, and is therefore of an arborescent form. Such calculi vary in have been obliged for several valuable morbid prepara- tions.

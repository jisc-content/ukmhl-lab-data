I 313 1 Although the world is much obliged to these two celebrated chemists, Scheele and Bergman, for their labours upon this, as well as many other subjects, yet I am in- clined to think that a sufficient number of urinary calculi has not yet been examined, to ascertain all the variety of their consti- tuent parts.* * This conjecture is now verified by Dr. Wm. Hyde Wollaston, who has lately made some valuable experi- ments upon urinary calculi, an account of which will be published in the next volume of the Philosophical Transactions. Besides the kind Vvhich has been analyzed by Scheele, and which has been noticed above, he has ascertained that there are three other kinds of urinary calculi, essentially different from each other in their composition. These three kinds are, TTe fusible calculus, which consists of crystals, formed by phosphoric acid, magnesia, and volatile alkali; these are mixed with some phosphorated lime, and gene- rally some lithic acid. This sort of calculus is fusible by the blow-pipe, and is of a white colour. 2d. The mulberry calculus, which consists of the acid of sugar, and the acid of phosphorus united with lime ; together generally with some lithic acid in the in- terstices. This sort of calculus is of a dark colour,

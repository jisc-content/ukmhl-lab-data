It seems to me reasonable to sup- 9 pose, that when scrofulous tumours grow in the pericardium, there will hardly be any inconvenience felt while they are small. But when they enlarge very much in size, they will necessarily prevent the full dila- tation of the heart, and disturb its functions. This, however, will probably be very diffi- cult to be distinguished from the disturb- ance produced by other causes, which must in the same manner impede the free action of the heart; as, for instance, the accumu- lation of water in the pericardium. The symptoms produced by a want of secretion in the pericardium are at present unknown.

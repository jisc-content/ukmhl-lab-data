C 208 3 CHAP. IX. DISEASED APPEARANCES OF THE LIVER. Inflammation of the Membrane of the Liver. The external membrane of the liver is not uncommonly found in a state of inflamma- tion. This may take place either when the peritonaeum generally over the cavity of the abdomen is inflamed, or the inflamma- tion may be confined to the membrane of the liver itself. When it is confined to the membrane of the liver, it is not frequently extended over the whole of it, but more commonly takes place in that part which covers the anterior, or convex part of the liver. I have also seen inflammation, or at least its effects, not unfrequently on that side of the liver, which is in contact with the stomach and the duodenum.

[ 367 3 Scbirrous Enlargement of the Uterus. It sometimes happens, although not very often, that the uterus enlarges in its size, and becomes much harder than in its na- tural state. I his change corresponds very much to that of schirrus in other parts of the body, and commonly extends over the whole of the uterus. It is difficult to say to what size the uterus may at length arrive, in the progress of this disease, but I have seen it. in one case, as large as the gravid uterus at the sixth month. If a transverse section be made of the uterus in this state, it is found to consist of a hard substance, having a brownish, or a brownish-white colour, and intersected by pretty thick membranes. Ulceration is sometimes dis- covered upon its inner surface, but I believe it is often wanting. Tubercles are occa- sionally formed in this state of the uterus, being, as it were, imbedded in its substance, and they have a structure very much re- sembling that of the uterus itself.

c 288 3 The renal capsules have also been ob- served to be changed into a cartilaginous substance, but this morbid appearance oc- curs very rarely.* Little granules of stone have been found in the substance of the renal capsules.^ SYMPTOMS. When the kidneys are inflamed, more or less pain is felt in the situation of these glands, and the pain often shoots along the course of the ureters. There is a sense of numbness in the thigh, and in the male there is often a retraction of the testicle, or a feeling of pain in it. When one kid- ney is affected, these symptoms are only felt upon that side. The urine is voided frequently, and is sometimes of a pale, but more commonly of a deep red colour. 1 he * Sec Socinmerringâ€™s Germ, translat. p. 173. t Vid. Licutaud, Tom. I. p. 286.

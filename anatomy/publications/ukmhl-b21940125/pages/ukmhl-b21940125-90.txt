C 44 3 of the aorta is sometimes irregular; but \ often no irregularity can be felt in it. Difficulty of breathing upon taking exercise commonly attends this disease, and it is increased in proportion as the disease ad- vances. The symptoms which are produced by a diseased alteration in the structure of the valves of the heart, are not so distinct as to be clearly discriminated in practice. They consist of difficulty of breathing ; of occa- sional palpitations ; of a weak and often an irregular pulse ; and in some cases there has been observed a disposition to fainting. The assemblage of symptoms, which is called angina pectoris, has sometimes been found to attend ossification of the valves. No observations have yet been made by which practitioners may be led to conjec- ture what set of valves is diseased.

C 207 n which are produced by the common round worm of the intestines. In both diseases there is a tumid belly, and emaciated ex- tremities. They are chiefly to be distin- guished by worms not being discovered in the one disease, notwithstanding the use of strong purgatives, while they pass oflf from the bowels in the other. The startings, and the grinding of the teeth, may perhaps also form some ground of distinction be- tween the two diseases : they occur very commonly in worms, but I believe rarely, if at all, in scrofulous glands of the mesen- tery. Some discrimination, likewise, be- tween the two diseases, may sometimes be derived from examining strictly into the nature of the constitution. If decided marks of scrofula shew' themselves in an external part of the body, they will lead a practi- tioner more satisfactorily to the opinion, that the mesenteric glands are also, affected * with the same disease.

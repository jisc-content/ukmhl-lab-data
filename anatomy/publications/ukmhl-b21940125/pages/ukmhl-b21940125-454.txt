C 408 3 Ulcers of the Vagina. Ulcerations are not unusual in the vagina. They sometimes appear like spots of the internal surface, removed as it were by a knife, and sometimes there is a foul ragged ulcer. When this last is the case in any considerable degree, the ulcer has com- monly not originated in the vagina, but has spread to it from the womb. When the ulcer spreads very much, communications aie often made with the neighbouring parts, producing a most miserable state of ex- istence. Thus communications are some- times formed between the vagina and the rectum, or the vagina and the bladder. Schirrous Tumours in the Vagina. Schirrous tumours occasionally arise in the vagina itself (although, I believe, rarely) when the uterus is unaffected. When cut into, they exhibit the schirrous structure which has been often described.

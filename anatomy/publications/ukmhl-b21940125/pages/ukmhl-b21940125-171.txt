The reason of this difference probably is, that the peritonaeum is less con- nected with the abdominal muscles than with the intestinal canal, so that the inflam- mation passes less readily from the perito- naeum to the former than the latter part. The inflammation of the peritonaeum is sometimes slight and partial; at other times is great and universal. When it is slight, and affects that part of the peritonaeum which is connected with the intestinal canal, it often forms broad bands of inflammation, which run along the course of the intestines, and are bounded by the contact of the different portions of the intestines among themselves. In this case the coats of the intestine are not thicker than usual, the inflammation being slight, and confined to the peritonaeum itself. Where the inflammation is great, the intestines are much thicker, and more massy. This evidently arises from the greater accumulation of blood in the small blood vessels, as well as from the extrava- sation of fluids into the substance of the

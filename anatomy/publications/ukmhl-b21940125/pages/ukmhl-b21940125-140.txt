This state of the trachea was ac- companied with a schirrous affection of some absorbent glands, which closely adhered to it; and it appeared to me that the disease in the glands had spread so as to affect the trachea. Rings of the Trachea ossified. The cartilaginous rings of the trachea occasionally become ossified.

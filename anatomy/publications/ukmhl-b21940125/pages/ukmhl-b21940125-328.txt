They are also sometimes smooth, and some- times a little roughened on their surface. Of the nature of urinary calculi we shall speak afterwards, when we come to take notice of the diseased appearances of the bladder. When a stone in the pelvis of the ureter has increased to a very consider- able size, it almost entirely prevents the urine from passing into the ureter. The urine is therefore accumulated in the pelvis, above the stone, and hence enlarges the pelvis very much, as well as the cavity in the kidney itself.

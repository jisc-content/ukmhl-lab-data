Near the head of this worm, the canal is nar- rower than it is any where else, and some- what distinct in its limits, which may be considered as the oesophagus. In the earth worm, there is a large and complex sto- mach, consisting of two cavities ; and the intestinal canal in the latter is likewise i larger, and more formed into sacculi, than the former.

In stricture of the urethra there is difficul- ty in making water, which is more or less according to the degree of the stricture; the stream of urine is small, sometimes forked, sometimes scattered, and sometimes the urine passes away in drops only. There is also an increased secretion of mucus from the urethra, resembling a gleet. Various other symptoms may take place, in conse- quence of the parts in the neighbourhood Of the stricture being affected ; and even the constitution is sometimes much disturb- ed by this local irritation, exhibiting very different symptoms in different individuals. When the urethra is obstructed by the growth of a caruncle, no symptoms are known by which it may be distinguished from a case of common stricture.

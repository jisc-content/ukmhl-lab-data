t 34i D Morgagni mentions one of them being converted into a ligamentous substance ;* and the excretory duct of one in another instance being obliterated.-f Inner Membrane of the Urethra inflamed. The inner membrane of the urethra is very liable to be inflamed, particularly at its anterior extremity, and the inflamma- tion occasionally spreads over the whole extent of the canal. This exhibits no ap- pearance different from the inflammation of membranes lining secretory canals which open externally. The membrane is much more crowded with small blood vessels than in a natural state, and there is an in- creased secretion of the glands which open upon it. The inflammation is often not confined to the inner membrane of the urethra, but spreads into the substance of the corpus spongiosum, affecting both its cellular structure and its glands.

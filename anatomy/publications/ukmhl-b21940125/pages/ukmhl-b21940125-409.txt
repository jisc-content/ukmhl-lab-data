A schirrous testicle may be ascertain- ed in the living body, by its great hard- ness, and by the pain that is often felt in it, which darts along the spermatic chord to the loins. Its progress is commonly slow, the spermatic chord becomes ulti- mately diseased, and the general health at length much impaired. When it throws out a fungus, or forms an ill-condition- ed ulcer, these become additional external marks of the nature of the disease. The encysted tumour of the spermatic chord containing water, resembles, in some appearances, hydrocele. It may, however, be distinguished from it by the testicle being felt separate and entire under the tumour, which in hydrocele is never the case.

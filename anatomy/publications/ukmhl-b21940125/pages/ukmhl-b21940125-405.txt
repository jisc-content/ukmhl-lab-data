In this state of the spermatic chord, the testicle is sometimes wasted. Water accumulated in the Cellular Membrane of the Spermatic Chord, Water has sometimes been known to be accumulated in the cells of the cellular membrane, which envelopes the vessels of the spermatic chord. The cellular mem- brane of this part of the body is in con- siderable quantity, and when water is ac- cumulated in its cells, there is a large swelling formed in the situation of the spermatic chord, which is readily diminish- ed upon pressure.

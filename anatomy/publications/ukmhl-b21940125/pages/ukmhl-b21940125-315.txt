c 269: scesses in the pancreas have commonly complained of pain in the back and loins, but they seem to have had no peculiar symptoms. When the pancreas becomes harder than in its healthy state, it is often, I believe, not attended with any painful sensations to the patient which are strongly marked. But it sometimes happens, although rarely, that the pancreas becomes much enlarged in its size, as well as hard in its structure, under- going these changes which belong to schir- rus. In such cases, a long continued pain has been remarked to exist in the epigastric region, and the stomach has been affected with sickness. In one instance, of which I have heard an account, besides the symp- toms already mentioned, there was a pain in the hips, and a sense of numbness in one thigh and leg.

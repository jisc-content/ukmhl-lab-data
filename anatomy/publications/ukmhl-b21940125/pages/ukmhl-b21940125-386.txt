This stone had probably been driven into the cavity of the membranous part of the urethra, by the stream of urine from the bladder, l^ut was too large to pass by the same means through the whole length of the urethra ; it there- fore stuck in that situation, and was gra- dually increased to the size which we have described, by the contact of the urine, si- milar to the growth of a stone in the pelvis of the ureters. Cowper’s Glands seldom observed to be dis- eased. I do not recollect to have seen Cowper’s glands diseased, which are situated near this part of the urethra. They are doubt- less liable to changes from disease, like other parts of the body; but they are small and difficult of access, so that they have very seldom become an object of exa- mination.

c 4^ n. of the earth to the animal part is larger than in common bone. There is often one of these ossifications only; but sometimes there are more of them. The falciform process has been said to be occasionally found almost entirely converted into bone ; but this last appear- ance is very rare. Very strong Adhesion of the Dura Mater to the Cranium. There is at all times a strong adhesion between the dura mater and the inside of the cranium. This adhesion is principally formed by small blood vessels which pass from the one to the other, and likewise by a close application of the fibrous structure of the membrane to the bone. In a natural state, however, the dura mater can be per- fectly separated from the cranium ; yet it sometimes happens that the adhesion is so strong, as to render it impossible to separate the two completely. 1 he dura matci in such an attempt is torn in different parts

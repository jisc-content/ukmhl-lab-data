C &> 3 well as in every other part of the arterial system, happen much more rarely in women than in men. This arises from two causes. The one is, that women, from their sedenta- ry life, are less liable to an increased im- petus of the blood, occasioned by excited circulation ; the other is, that the arteries in this sex appear to be less liable to diseased alterations of structure. This is not at all pe- culiar to aneurysm; some other diseases pre- vail in the one sex, from which the other is in a great measure exempt. Ossification of the Semi-lunar Valves. The three semi-lunar valves at the origin of the aorta, or of the pulmonary artery, are often found diseased. This very commonly consists in the deposition of a bony or earthy matter, and would seem to be formed by a morbid action of some very minute vessels which aredistributed through the substance of the valves. These vessels are so small, as not to contain, in their natural state, the red globules of the blood.

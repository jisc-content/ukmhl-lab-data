[ 65 D are deeply seated in the substance of the lungs, the pleura is commonly not affected; but when abscesses are formed near the sur- face, it is almost constantly inflamed. The lungs round the boundaries of an abscess, when it has arisen from common inflamma- tion, are more solid in their texture, in con- sequence of coagulable lymph being thrown out during the progress of the inflammation. When the abscesses are scrofulous, the tex- ture of the lungs in the neighbourhood is sometimes not firmer than usual, but pre- sents the common natural appearance. This I believe to be principally the case when the abscesses are small, and placed at a con- siderable distance from each other.

When blood vessels are traced into an ab- scess of the lungs, I have found them, upon examination, very much contracied, just before they reach the abscess, so that the F

C 36 3 mi nates in the left branch of the pulmonary artery. The right auricle is larger than its natural size, from the frequent accumulation of blood in it; and the communication be- tween the two auricles, by means of the fo- ramen ovale, is much larger than usual. The child in whom this malformation was found, had its skin of a very dark colour, had very laborious respiration, and violent action of the heart. It lived only thirteen days. In another case related by Dr. Hunter, the pulmonary artery was very small, espe- cially at its origin, and there was a defi- ciency in the septum cordis, at the basis of the heart, large enough to allow a small thumb to pass through it. The person in whom this malformation of the heart was found, lived about thirteen years. He never had a fresh complexion, but it was always dark, or tending to black. He was often seized with fits, especially when there was any hurry upon his spirits, or there had been any brisk motion of his body.

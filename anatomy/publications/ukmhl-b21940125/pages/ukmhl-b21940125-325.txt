Â£ 279 3 Sometimes, however, the true hydatid is formed in the kidneys, having exactly the same nature with that which grows in the liver. It has occurred to me to be able to examine particularly a case of this kind after death, and I shall describe at some length what came under my observation. The right kidney, in a soldier, was con- verted into a bag capable of containing at least three pints of fluid, and only a very small part of the kidney at the lower end retained its natural structure. The bag was of considerable thickness, was obscure- ly laminated, and had a cartilaginous hard- ness upon its inner surface. It was full of hydatids, which differed very much from each other in their size, some of them being as large as a small orange, and others not larger than the head of a pin. Some of the small hydatids were lodged in little cavities formed in the inner surface of the bag. Their coats were in general easily separable into two laminae, and varied good deal in thickness in different hydatids.

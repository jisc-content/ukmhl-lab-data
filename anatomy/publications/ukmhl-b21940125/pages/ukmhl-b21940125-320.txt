C 374 3 Scrofulous Tubercles in the Kidneys. It is not unusual (as we have stated above) for scrofulous abscesses to take place in the kidneys, but it occurs very rarely that scrofulous tubercles are formed in them. I have seen, however, an instance of this kind, and the tubercles resembled most exactly the common tubercles of the lungs. None of them were in a state of suppuration. * Kidney schirrous. The kidney I have once seen converted into a firm, brown, uniform substance, somewhat intersected by membrane, in which the natural structure of this gland was entirely lost. The kidney was at the same time very much enlarged in size. This alteration of structure 1 should call schirrus, because it exactly resembles schir- rus in other parts of the body : it is, I am persuaded, very rare in the kidneys.

The pha- rynx is not contracted gradually, so as to . lose itself insensibly in the oesophagus, but contracts itself rather suddenly at the lower end. Hencea little recess is formed, in which an extraneous body may occasionally rest. This is necessarily at the posterior part; so that if the recess should be enlarged into a cavity, it must pass behind the oesophagus. The particulars of this singular case have been published in the Medical Observa- tions.* The descending Aorta. There is hardly any other disease of the descending aorta within the posterior me- diastinum, than aneurysm. This consists in the aorta being a good deal enlarged be- yond its natural size, in its coats being ir- regularly thickened, and more readily divi- * See the Medical Observations, Vol. III. p. 85.

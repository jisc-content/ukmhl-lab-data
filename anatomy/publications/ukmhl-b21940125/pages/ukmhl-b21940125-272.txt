C 2°-6 3 is allowed to remain for so long a time after death before it is examined, that the hyda- tids must have lost their living principle, even if they were animalcules. The pro- bability of their being animalcules, how- ever, is very strong; and it appears even more difficult to account for their produc- tion according to the common theory of ge- neration, than for that of intestinal worms. We do not get rid of the difficulty by as- serting, that hydatids in the human liver are not living animals, because in sheep they are certainly such, where the difficulty of accounting for their production is pre- cisely the same. I have mentioned, how- ever, already every thing I had to say upon this subject, when speaking of intestinal worms. If any person should wish to con- sider hydatids more minutely, he will find an excellent account of them published by Dr. John Hunter in the Medical and Chi- rurgical Transactions.* ♦ See Medical and Chirurgical Transactions, p. 34-

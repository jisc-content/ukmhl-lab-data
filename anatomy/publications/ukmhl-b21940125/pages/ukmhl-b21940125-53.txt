C 7 3 circumscribed cavity. When this is the case, it seems extremely probable that the small arteries, distributed in the layer of the coa- gulable lymph, have poured out the pus. This, I believe, has not hitherto been thought of; but it is difficult to conceive under these circumstances any other source from whence the pus is derived. If the pus be supposed to be formed by the arteries which ramify in the inflamed membrane itself, then it must transude through a layer of coagulable lymph, which often is of considerable thick- ness before it accumulates in the cavity. This, however, is not likely; and as arteries pass from the original membrane into the layer of the coagulable lymph, it becomes much more natural to suppose that pus is formed by the arteries distributed in the coagulable lymph, than in the original membrane itself.

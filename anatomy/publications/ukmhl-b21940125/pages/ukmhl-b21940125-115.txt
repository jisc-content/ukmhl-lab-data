c: 69 3 When tubercles are converted into ab- scesses, pthisis pulmonalis is produced, one of the most destructive diseases in this island. Tubercles are sometimes found in lungs of children at a very early age, viz. two or three years old ; but they most fre- quently occur before the completion of the growth. They are apt, likewise, to be form- ed at rather an advanced age. In cutting into the lungs, a considerable portion of their structure sometimes appears to be changed into a whitish soft matter, somewhat intermediate between a solid and a fluid, like a scrofulous gland just begin- ning to suppurate. This appearance I be- lieve is produced by scrofulous matter being deposited in the cellular substance of a cer- tain portion of the lungs, and advancing to- wards suppuration. It seems to be the same matter with that of the tubercle, but only diffused uniformly over a considerable por- tion of the lungs, while the tubercle is cir- cumscribed.

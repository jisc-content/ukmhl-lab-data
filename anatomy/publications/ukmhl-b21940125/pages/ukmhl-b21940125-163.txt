C â€™<7 3 The symptoms of the croup are, the ge- neral affection of the system called fever, difficulty of breathing, a wheezing noise in inspiration, a hoarse voice, and a sort of ringing sound during coughing : portions of a whitish membrane and pus are at the same time occasionally coughed up. It may perhaps be not unreasonable to suppose that the whitish membrane is formed by some peculiar action of the blood vessels of the inner surface of the larynx and the trachea, which is superadded to inflammation. In common inflammation of the inner surface of the larynx and trachea, there is merely an increased secretion of mucus, or some- times of pus ; but in the croup an adven- titious membrane is always formed. This gives some probability to the supposition which we have made ; and it may perhaps serve to explain why the croup is so rarely cured by the means which are known to re- move common inflammation.

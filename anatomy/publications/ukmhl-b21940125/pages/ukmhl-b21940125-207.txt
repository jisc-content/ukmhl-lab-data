C >6i 3 could never have happened if the hlack por- tion of the intestine had really been morti- fied. Under such circumstances, the mor- tified part would have separated from the living, and the function of the gut must have been destroyed. When a portion of gut has been for some time mortified, a consider- able quantity of air is formed, which is accumulated "in its cavity. This is a part of the natural process which takes place in all dead animal substances. I have known an instance where a large portion of the great intestine (viz. above a yard of it), had lost its living principle, and was ex- pelled through the anus. The person lived about three weeks afterwards* Intus-Susceptio. This is not a very uncommon disease, and is frequently fatal. It consists in a portion of gut passing for some length within an- other portion, and dragging along with it * This very singular case will be described in the next volume of the Med and Chirurg.

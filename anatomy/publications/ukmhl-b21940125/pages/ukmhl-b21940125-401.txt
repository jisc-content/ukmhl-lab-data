C 355 J The Epidydimis ending in a Cul-de-Sac. The testicles have sometimes this sort of malformation, that the epidydimis does not terminate in a vas deferens, but in a cul-de-sac. In these cases it is evident that the semen cannot be evacuated by the ure- thra, and the person must therefore be in- capable of procreation. In Dr. Hunter's collection, a preparation of this sort is pre- served ; and Mr. Hunter has given a re- presentation of it in his Animal Economy.* Stricture of the J as Deferens. I have also seen a portion of the canal of the vas deferens obliterated by stricture. Ibis had not been an original fault, but was the effect of a diseased process, similar probably to that which produces stricture in the urethra, and must have prevented the semen of one of the testicles from reach- ing the cavity of the prostate gland. * See page 47, plate V.

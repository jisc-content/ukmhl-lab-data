C if 3 region of the heart, which is often, but not always attended with palpitations, and with an irregular pulse ; cough ; difficul- ty of breathing; and sometimes syncope. The symptoms attending adhesions of the pericardium to the heart are not so clearly marked as to be well distinguished in practice. When the adhesions are partial and long, so that the heart can enjoy a free play within the pericardium, probably little or no inconvenience is felt. But when the adhesions are close, and extend gene- rally over the surface of the heart, the fol- lowing symptoms have been observed, viz. a sense of oppression, and sometimes of pain, in the situation of the heart ; a pulse which is often irregular and intermittent; difficulty of breathing, and sometimes a dry cough. *

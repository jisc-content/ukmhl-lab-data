C 3Â°2 ] fibres, little pouches are formed by the in- ner membrane. This arises from the pres- sure of the urine against the inner mem- brane of the bladder, which is impelled by the strong powers of the muscular coat. These pouches are often large enough to admit the end of the finger, and contain occasionally small calculi. The bladder in this state admits of very little distension, so that it is capable of containing little water; hence the inclination to make water is fre- quent, and frequent efforts of the muscular coat are required, which increase more and more its thickness. It is much more com- mon to find this appearance of the bladder in the male than in the female, because in the latter there are fewer causes to produce it: since in that sex there is a want of the prostate gland altogether, and the urethra being short and wide, obstructions seldom take place in it. When the muscular coat of the bladder has been thickened, I believe that it has been sometimes mistaken for schirrus.

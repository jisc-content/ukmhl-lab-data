n j72 3 t an advanced period of life, schirrus is not uncommon ; every portion of this intestine is not equally liable to be affected by it, but it is to be found much more frequently at the sigmoid flexure of the colon, or in the rectu n, than any where else ; the rea- son of this it is, perhaps, difficult to deter- mine. There is certainly more of glandu- lar structure in the inner membrane of the great intestine towards its lower extremity, than in any other part of it, and this sort of structure has a greater tendency to be affected with schirrus, than the ordinary structures of the body : the gut, too, is narrower at the sigmoid flexure than at any other part, and therefore must be more liable to be injured by the passage of hard bodies; these by their irritation, may ex- cite the disease of schirrus in a part which was pre-disposed to it. What we have now said, however, is merely conjectural. The schirrus sometimes extends over a considerable length of the gut, viz. several inches; but generally it is more circum- t

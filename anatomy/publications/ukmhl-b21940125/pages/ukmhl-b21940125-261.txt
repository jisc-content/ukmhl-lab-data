C 215 D is often smaller. If a section of the liver be made in this state, its vessels seem to have a smaller diameter than they have naturally. It very frequently happens that in this state the liver is of a yellow colour, arising from the bile accumulated in its substance ; and there is also water in the cavity of the ab- domen, which is yellow, from the mixture of bile. The gall-bladder is generally much contracted, and of a white colour, from its being empty. The bile, from the pressure of the hard liver upon the pori biliarii, does not reach the ductus hepaticus, and there- fore cannot pass into the gall-bladder. The colour of the skin in such cases is jaundiced, and it remains permanently so, as it depends on a state of liver not liable to change. This is the common appearance of what is gene- rally called a schirrous liver : but it bears only a remote resemblance to schirrus, as it shews itself in other parts of the body. I should therefore be disposed to consider it % as a peculiar disease affecting this viscus.

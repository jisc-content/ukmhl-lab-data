C 74 3 which ramify upon the vesicles, have the power of secreting the air.* Lungs changed into a substance like Live?'. The lungs are sometimes converted into a solid substance very much resembling the liver. It has nearly the same solidity, and the same general appearance. I have only seen an example of this change in a prepa- ration, and I am inclined to believe that it had been produced by a wide extended in- flammation, in which a large quantity of coagulable lymph had been extravasated into the substance of the lungs. The ex- travasation would necessarily render the texture of the lungs very solid ; and the his- tory of the symptoms which have been ob- served to attend similar morbid changes, supports this opinion. The symptoms are those which are produced by an inflamma- tion of the lungs. * See Hunterâ€™s Animal Economy, p. 165.

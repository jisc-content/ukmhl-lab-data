C 399 3 Bat when it has made considerable pro- gress, so as to have formed a swelling at the lower part of the belly, it may com- monly be ascertained by an accurate exa- mination, and attention to the history of its growth. The tumour is generally on one side of the abdomen more than the other, according as the right or left ova- rium is affected. There is often an inequa- lity in the surface of the swelling, and an obscure kind of fluctuation is felt upon striking with the hand the parietes of the abdomen, which cover the swelling. The health is commonly very little affected by this disease, and it is slow in its progress, so that life will often be continued with toleiable comfoit under it for many years. J he quantity of the urine is often but little diminished below what is usual in health, and the absorbents of the ovarium are hard- ly capable of being excited to-a vigorous action by medicine. There have been few instances, therefore, of a dropsy of the ova- rium being cured.

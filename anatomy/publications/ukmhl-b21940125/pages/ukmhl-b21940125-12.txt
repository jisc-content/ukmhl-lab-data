11 PREFACE TO THE very much to be regretted that the know- ledge of morbid structure does not lead with certainty to the knowledge of morbid ac- tions, although the one is the effect of the other; yet surely it lays the most solid foundation for prosecuting such inquiries with success. In proportion, therefore, as we shall become acquainted with the changes produced in the structure of parts from diseased actions, we shall be more likely to make some progress towards a knowledge of the actions themselves, although it must be very slowly. The subject in itself is extremely difficult, because morbid actions are going on in the minute parts of an animal body excluded from observation ; but still the examination of morbid struc- ture seems to be one of the most probable means of throwing light upon it.

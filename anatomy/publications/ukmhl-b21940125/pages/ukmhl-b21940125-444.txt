t 398 ] ovaria. Inflammation of the ovaria can- not at present be distinguished, by its symp- toms, from inflammation of the uterus. A schirrous state of the ovaria, is with difficulty determined in the living body. When a schirrous ovarium has increased to a large size, and lies upon the side of the pelvis, and the person is at the same time of a spare habit, it may in some measure be ascertained by an accurate examination of the tumour through the parietes of the ab- domen. It will feel much harder than where an ovarium is enlarged by dropsy, or filled with hydatids. When the ovarium is not capable of being accurately examined, the opinion about the existence of this dis- ease must rest much more upon probable evidence than upon any clear proof. Dropsy of the ovarium cannot be ascer- tained in a very early stage of this disease.

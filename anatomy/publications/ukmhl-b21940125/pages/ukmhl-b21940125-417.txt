Another sort of polypus takes place in the uterus, which consists of an irregu- lar, bloody substance, with a number of tattered processes hanging from it. This when cut into exhibits two different ap- pearances of structure : the one appear- ance is that of a spongy mass, consisting of laminae, with small interstitial cavities between them; the other is that of a very loose texture, consisting of large irregular cavities. These are the different varieties in polypi, which I have observed ; but per- haps there may be others, which have not come under my notice. It is very obvious, that in proportion as a polypus grows, the cavity of the uterus must be enlarged, and the same change must take place in the vagina, when a polypus protrudes from the uterus into this canal.

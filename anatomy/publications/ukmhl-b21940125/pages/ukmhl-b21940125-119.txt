C 73 1 not allowed the common free egress from the lungs, and therefore accumulating in them. It is not improbable also, that this accumulation may sometimes break down two or three contiguous cells into one, and thereby form a cell of a very large size. Air Viesicles attached to the Edge of the Lungs. Vesicles containing air have occasionally been seen attached to the edge of the lungs. They do not communicate, however, with the structure of this organ, but are com- plete in themselves. Upon the first view, it might be thought probable that they were merely some ol the air cells enlarged ; but as they do not communicate with any of the air cells, this opinion would not seem to be well founded. It is most likely that they are a morbid structure, formed in the same manner as the air vesicles attached to the intestines and mesentery of some quadru- peds, and that the very minute blood vessels

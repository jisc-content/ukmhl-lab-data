C 440 3 part of the water passes very readily into the third ventricle, and from thence into the fourth. The water is of a purer co- lour, and more limpid, than what is found in dropsy of the thorax or abdomen. It appears, however, to be generally of the same nature with the water that is accu- mulated in both of those large cavities. In what appears to me to be the real state of the circum- stances. The fornix at its anterior extremity lies loose upon a part of the thalami nervorum opticorum, and there is a small chink on each side of the fornix leading obliquely downwards from the lateral ventricles to the anterior extremity of the third ventricle. While the fornix is allowed to remain in its natural situation, there seems to me to be no immediate communication between the lateral ventricles. But when the fornix is elevated (which may be very easily done) then the la- teral ventricles communicate with each other ; and the communication is more or less according to the degree of the elevation. It may be said, that the lateral ven- tricles still communicate together by means of the third ventricle. This, however, does not seem to me to be properly a communication between the two lateral ven- tricles, unless any two cavities which communicate with a third, may be properly said to communicate with each other.

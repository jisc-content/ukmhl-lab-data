C 41 1 Hydatids adhering to the Heart. Hydatids* have occasionally been found adhering to the heart ; but I have myself met with no instances of this sort. They do not appear to be of the same kind in every part of the body; but their nature will be explained particularly, when I come to describe the diseased appearances of the liver and kidneys. A Portion of the Heart bony, or earthy. A portion of the heart has been observed to be converted into bone.-f Earthy matter has also been found deposited in the muscu- lar substance of the heart.* None of these appearances have come under my own ob- servation, and they are to be looked upon as very uncommon. * See Morgagni, Epist.

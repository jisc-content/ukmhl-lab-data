When the excrescence is very near the neck ol the bladder, the disease may be ascertain- ed by the introduction of the sound into the urethra. The extremity of the sound will come in contact with the excrescence, and will give the sensation of its pressing against a soft tumour. It may be said, that this case will with difficulty be dis- tinguished by such an examination, from an enlargement of the prostate gland. By examining, however, into the state of the prostate gland in the usual way through the rectum, the one case may be sufficiently distinguished from the other. The symptoms which belong to a poly- pus formed in the bladder, are unknown to me ; but they are probably much the same with those which attend fungous excres- cences in the bladder, as above described.

In this case, one should expect a want of nerves through the whole body. It is, however, not so; nerves are found distributed in the com- mon way, through the limbs, and the dor- sal nerves can be seen arising from a mem- brane somewhat resembling the dura mater in the canal behind the vertebra.

This is generally divided into distinct protuberant masses, and is covered with a fine skin, capable of being rendered very vascular by injection. When cut into, the spongy ex'

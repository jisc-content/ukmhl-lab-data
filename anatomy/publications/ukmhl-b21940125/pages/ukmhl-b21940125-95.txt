Hence what- ever may act upon these external vessels, so as to excite contraction in them, may be supposed capable of producing an accumu- lation of blood, as well as an increased ac- tion in the inner branches of the iutercos- tals, many of which are distributed upon the pleura. Perhaps, too, there may be a greater consent between the action of the external and internal vessels of the chest, than in the body generally. If these ob- servations be just, they would account for the very frequent inflammation of the pleu- ra ; but they are only to be considered in the light of a conjecture.

C 26 3 tumour, and at other times there are smaller aneurysmalswellings rising out of thelarger one. This enlargement of the artery, if very considerable, is more or less filled with coagulated blood, which is disposed in concentric laminae. The coats of the dilat- ed artery, are nearly of the same thickness with those in its natural state, and therefore in proportion as the swelling increases, new matter must be deposited in the coats of the artery. This new matter would seem to be deposited with a view to prevent the artery from being so soon ruptured as it would be otherwise, and is formed by the action of the vasa vasorum. A portion of the new matter may perhaps also be formed by the action of the parts immediately in contact with the artery. The coats of the artery, both at the place where the aneurysm is formed, and near it, are considerably altered from their natural structure. They are more readily divisible into different layers, and have often formed in them spots of bony matter. These spots are frequently of a yellowish colour, and are

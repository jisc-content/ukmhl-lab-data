JPaet II.] OF BIRDS. ,215 I cidum. The Corpora Striata are of uniform colour in- ternally. The Thalami are two roundish Tubercles lying un- der the Hemispheres, without being inclosed by them. Between the Thalami and Corpora Striata are com- .monly four Eminences, which do not appear in Man. The Lateral Ventricles do not turn down behind to form the inferior Cornua ; of course, the Cornua Ammonis are absent. The Lateral Ventricles, in Birds, are distin- guished from those of all other Animals, by the radiated partition which separates them from each other. They communicate with each other, and with the Third Ven- •triole. The Third Ventricle is situated between the Thalami, and communicates with the Infundibulum, and also with the Fourth Ventricle; but the passage into this last is only covered by a thin Lamina, the Tubercula Quadrigemina being either absent or indistinct, though the Pineal Gland is present. In each of the Optic Thalami, there is an additional % Ventricle, which opens into the passage leading from the Third to the Fourth Ventricle. The Cerebellum is only a simple Lobe; it has, how- ever, transverse Striae, somewhat similar to those in Mammalia. The Fourth Ventricle has also, as in that class, a Calamus Scriptorius, and an Arbor Vitae; but the latter is more simple than in Mammiferous Ani- mals. The Pons VaroUi is wanting. The Medulla Oblon- gata has no Eminences, such as are seen in the former class of Animals. O 4 Nerves. — ' T"" - • r- - .- •

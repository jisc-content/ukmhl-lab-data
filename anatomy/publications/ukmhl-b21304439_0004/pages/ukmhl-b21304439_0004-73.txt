In Ruminants, there is an Extensor Proprius analo- gous to the Extensor Pollicis; but in Solipeds, it is wanting. In Monkeys, the Aponeurosis of the Sole, continued from the Plantaris, must affect the Metatarsal Bones, into which it is inserted. The long and short Flexors of the Toes are confusedly connected to each other, and to the Bones of the Foot and Toes. The Massa Carnea is attached not only to the Flexor Longus Digitorum, but to the Flexor Longus Pollicis. In other Quadrupeds, the Flexor Brevis Digitorum is wanting, but its place is supplied by the Plantaris, which is proportionally strong, and has its Tendons perforated by those of the Flexor Longus, the number of which is equal to the number of the Toes. Though the Great Toe is wanting in these Animals, they have a Muscle analogous to the Flexor Longus Pollicis, the Tendon of which is united to that of the Flexor Profundus. OF

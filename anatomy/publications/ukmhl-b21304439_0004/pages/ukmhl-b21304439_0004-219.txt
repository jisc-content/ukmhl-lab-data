2i9 OF BIRDS. Part II.] After the Membrane lias been drawn to the outer corner of the Eye, it is returned by its own elasticity. The Lacrymal Gland, in Birds, is commonly small. It is situated at the outer angle, and sends out the Tears in some, as the Common Ford, by one, and in others, by two or three small Canals, through the Up- per Eye-lid. The Glandula Harderi is also found here ; it is of a fleshy colour, and considerably larger than the Lacry- pial Gland. It is commonly placed between the Le- vator and Adductor Oculi, and discharges, by a single Duct, a yellowish fluid upon the inner surface of "the third Palpebra. In the Duck tribe and the Water Birds, there is a large Glandular Body in the upper part of the Orbit, which seems to supply the place of the Lacrymal Gland, yet no Duct has been traced from it. All Birds have two Puncta Lacrymalia, but no Ca- runcula Lacrymalis. The passages from the Puncta terminate in the Nasal Sac, situated in the Palate, at the base of the Nose. The Sclerotic Coat forms little more than a hemi- sphere in this class, and to its anterior flat part is at- tached the Cornea, making a section of a smaller globe. In consequence of the flatness of the anterior part of the Eye, it is prevented from being injured when the Animal is scrambling among bushes, or taking a rapid flight through the air. The fore part of the Sclcrotis divides into two Lami- na?, between which there are numerous Osseous Plates, which overlap each other, and form a Ring, commonly flat.

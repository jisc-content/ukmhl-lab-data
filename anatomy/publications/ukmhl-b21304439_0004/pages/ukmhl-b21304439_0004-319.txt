OP FISHES. 319 Part IV.] In the Raja, Squalus, &c. among the Cartilaginous kind, the Nostrils communicate with the Mouth by a Chink of considerable magnitude. In Osseous Fishes, instead of turbinated Bones, there are numerous Membranous Laminae, running in a ra- diated manner from a Tubercle at the bottom of the Nose; but in the Raja, Squalus, and several others, there is an elegant plaited Membrane, in place of Ossa Spongiosa. This is disposed in crescentic folds, some- what in a parallel direction to each other, and placed on each side of a principal Lamina, which extends from one end of the Nostril to the other. There is no Foramen IncisiVum in Fishes, there be- ing, strictly speaking, no Nasal Cavity here. Upon the Laminae above mentioned in the Nose, the Branches of the Olfactory Nerves are expanded, sup- plying the whole internal surface of that Cavity, and there forming a Retina, as in the Eye; but the Fila- ments are more distinct. OF THE TONGUE. ^ - The Tongue, in Fishes, is in general of such a firm Cartilaginous nature, that some have doubted how far it is to be considered as an Organ of Taste. The Skin covering it is commonly very thick, like that of the rest of the Mouth. It exhibits no distinct Pa- pi 11m-

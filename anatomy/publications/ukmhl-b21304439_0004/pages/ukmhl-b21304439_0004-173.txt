173 OF MAMMALIA. Fart I.] two substances, and in the number and absence of Papillae and Infundibula. The situation differs from that in the Human Body, in the right being commonly higher, or, strictly speak- ing, farther forward than the left. The form is most frequently like that in Man, but sometimes Globu- lar, as in the Dogâ€¢; triangular, as in the Horse ; and long, as in the Hog; but the greatest difference is in their division into Lobes. In many of the Glires, and in the different Ferae, they are simple, each having a Cortical and a Medullary part, with only one Papilla. In many individuals of the class, they form tfhat are termed Conglomerated Kidneys, being divided, not only in the Foetus, as in the Human Subject, but during life, into a collection of smaller Kidneys. In the Ox and Elephant, the Kidneys are separated into Lobes, of which there are in the former between twenty and thirty, and in the latter four; but they are deeply di- vided in the Bear, Otter, and other Amphibia, and in the Cetacea, so much so, as to appear like a bunch of grapes, and are connected only by their Sanguiferous and Urinary Vessels. These Lobes are for the most part numerous, being in the Bear fifty or sixty, and in some of the Cetacea, the number is still greater; but the cause of this division is not ascertained. It has been supposed that, they are peculiar to Animals which live in Water, or frequent that fluid ; but the Brorcn or Land Bear has the Lobular Kidney, as well as the Polar one, which inhabits the coasts and water. The limits of the two substances are commonly dis- tinct.

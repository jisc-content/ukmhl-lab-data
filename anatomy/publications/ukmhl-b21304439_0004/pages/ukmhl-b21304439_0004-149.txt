149 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. OF THE STOMACH. The shape, proportional size, and general appearance of the Stomach, vary considerably in different Mamma- lia. In most Carnivorous Quadrupeds, it bears a strik- ing resemblance to that in Man. In some, however, it O is long; in others, of a roundish form. In many, it is simple; in several, it is divided into different apart- ments. It is termed complicated, when the Cavities within it have the same appearance; and compound, when they are of a different nature, particularly within. The number of the Coats of the Stomach is the same as in Man, but the Muscular and inner Coat vary much in appearance. In Carnivora, the Muscular Coat is proportionally strong, to enable the Stomach to act more powerfully on its contents. The inner surface, as in the Human Species, appears to be destitute of Glands, though they are observed in a few about the Cardia and Pylorus. In the Carnivorous Quadrupeds, the Cardia and Py- lorus are more directly on the extremities of the Sto- mach, than in the Herbivorous; in consequence of which the Food has a readier passage into the Intestines.

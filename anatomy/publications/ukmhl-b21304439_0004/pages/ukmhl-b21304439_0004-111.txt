The Blood-vessels are from similar Trunks with those in Man. The Nerves arise from the first and fifth pairs also, as in the Human Body. The Olfactory Nerves penetrate the Ethmoid Bone by Fibrillae, corresponding in number and size to the Foramina in the Cribriform Plate, and are dispersed upon the Mucous Membrane covering the Cells and Anterior Conchae of this Bone, and upon the parti- tion of the Nose. Some of these are soft and pulpy; others, as in the Ox and Sheep, can be readily traced. The Branches of the fifth pair belonging to the Nose, are from the Ophthalmic and Superior Maxillary Portions. Of the first, some minute Branches penetrate the Superior Orbitar Plate, to be dispersed upon the Membrane lining the Frontal Sinuses; others go to the Nose, re-enter the Cranium, and return to the Pituitary Membrane, as in Man. The Superior Maxillary Nerve supplies the inferior-posterior parts of the Nose, and sends Twigs to the Maxillary Sinuses much after the same manner as in the Human Species, allowance always be- ing made for the size and form of the organ in different Animals. Trunk and Proboscis of the Elephan t.â€”This very sin- gular Organ is extended into a long Fleshy substance of a conical form, fixed by its base to the Frontal and Intermaxillary Bones. It contains two Tubes a little before its axis, which form M

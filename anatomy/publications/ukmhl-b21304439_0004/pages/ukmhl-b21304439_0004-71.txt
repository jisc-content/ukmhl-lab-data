Part I.] 71 OF MAMMALIA. Aponeurotic. The IVIedius in that Animal is the iVIus- cle principally used in kicking. In the Bear, however, the Gluteus Maximus is so large, compared with the other Muscles, as to enable the Animal frequently to put itself into the upright posture. The Iliaeus Internus and Psoas Magnus are general- ly in proportion much longer than in Man, correspond- ing with the greater length of the Pelvis. The Pecti- neus, in the Dog, is peculiar for extending to the bot- tom of the Os Femoris. In the Cetacea, the Muscles of the Thigh are entirely wanting. Muscles of the Leg.â€”In Apes, the Muscles here are similar to those in Man, except that corresponding to the Biceps, which has only a single Head. In the Ro- dentia and Carnivora, the Extensors of the Knee are smaller than in Man, while the Flexors are stronger, corresponding with their purposes of walking. The Sartorius and Gracilis form the anterior edge of the Thigh. In all Quadrupeds, the short head of the Muscle analogous to the Biceps is wanting; but the single head not only covers a great part of the outer side of the Thigh, and is inserted into the Fibula, but gives Fibres to' the whole length of the Fascia Lata, and performs the office of an Exten- sor of the Thigh. In all Quadrupeds, the Gracilis is large ; the Semimembranosus and Semitendinosus, which are never wanting, are inserted so much farther down the Tibia than in Man, as to keep the Limb in a state of semi exion. This is found to be a principal cause in preventing Quadrupeds from walking in an E 4 erect

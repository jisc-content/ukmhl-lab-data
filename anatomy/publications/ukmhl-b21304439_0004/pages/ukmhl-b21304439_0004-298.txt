[Part IV. 2!)R 01'' THE BONES er, and turned back, and covered by the Gums, but come forward when any of the front row are lost, so as to supply their place. The situation of the Teeth is very variable. . They are placed in the Jaws,—or in the Palate,—or in the back part of the Septum Narium,—or in the Bone which supports the Tongue,—or in that which supports the Branchiae,—or at the beginning of the Esophagus ; and named, from their situation, Alandibular, Pala- tine,, SiC. Some, as theSalmon and Pike, have Teeth in all parts of their Mouth. The Squalus Pristis, or Saw-fish, has Teeth in both sides of the sword-shaped Bone in front of the Head. In some, the Teeth are only wanting in cer- tain parts of the Mouth. The Perch has them in eveiy part of the Mouth, excepting the Tongue. The Stur- geon has no Teeth. The number of the Vertebrae is also very variable in this class. In Osseous Fishes the Vertebrae of the Neck are wanting, or there are not more than three or four. In the Skate kind, they are united into one piece. The Vertebrae of the rest of the Spine varies extremely, being from about 20 to upwards of 100. Some Sharks have above 200. In some, they are cylindrical; in others, angular ; in others, flattened. They are articulated by their Bodies, having no oblique Processes. The Bodies of the Vertebrae are hollowed out into conical cups, containing a glairy matter. 1 he edges of the cups are joined to those of the contiguous Vertebrae through the whole length of the Spine, by Cartilages composed of concentric Fibres. The last Vertebra is generally

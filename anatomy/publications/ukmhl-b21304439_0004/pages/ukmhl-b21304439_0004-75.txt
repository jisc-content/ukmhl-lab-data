7o Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. *â€¢> Animals, and sometimes in different parts of the same individual. In the Cetacea, it is thicker than in any other Animal. The colour of this substance is also very variable. In some Apes, it is white on the Cheeks ; in others, it is of a violet or carmine colour on the Nose and Buttocks. On the Belly of the Whale, it is of a silver white. A connexion also is observed to subsist between the colour of this substance and that of the Palate and Iris. The Cutis is more variable in its thickness than the Cuticle. In the Wing of the Bat, it is remarkably thin. In most of the Bettuce, as the Elephant and Rhinoceros, it is of great thickness, but much more so on the Back than the Belly. In these Animals, it is deeply fissured. The Cuticle, here also very thick, fol- lows the fissures to their bottom. The Nervous Papillae of the Skin are nearly of a si- milar nature in all the Mammalia to those in Man, and are also most distinct in parts most susceptible of touch. Their figures vary considerably, but their structure is nearly the same, as may be seen by macerating them for some time in water. They are very apparent in the Snout of the Mole, Hog, Elephant, &c. and on the Fingers of the Monkey tribe. They have a thread-like form on the Paws of the Bear, and some of the other digitated Animals. They have an elegant appearance at the Teats of the Balcna, or true Whale; and are very dis- tinct on the Tongue of the Solipeds and Ruminants, and in the Wings of the Bat. A sixth sense has of late been ascribed to the Nervous Papilla? in the Skin of the Bat, which is found to pre- vent

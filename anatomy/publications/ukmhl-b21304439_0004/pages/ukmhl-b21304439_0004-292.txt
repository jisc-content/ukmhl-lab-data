292 OF THE MALE ORGANS [Part III. the Epididymis is a large Canal, which forms the \ as Deferens, that runs in a flexuous manner to open in the Cloaca at the base of the Penis. In Lizards, the Epi- didymis is detached from the Testicle, and forms a py- ramidal Body longer than it. From this the Vas Defe- rens goes along the edge of the Testicle, in a waving direction, to the Cloaca. In Frogs, the Vas Deferens terminates in a Papilla. The Vesiculae Seminales, and Prostate Gland, are not found in Reptiles in general. The Frog, however, has two large Vesiculae Seminales. In the Turtle kind, there is but one Penis. In most Lizards and Serpents, there are two. In the Frog kind, the Penis is entirely wanting. In the Turtle, it is very large, and in the relaxed state, is retracted within the Cloaca. It is composed of two Corpora Cavernosa, and has a Groove in its upper surface, instead of an Urethra, the margins of which come so close together when the part is distended, as to form a complete Canal. The Penis has two Retractor Muscles, which run from the Pelvis to the under side of the Gians. In Lizards and Serpents, the Pcnises are short and cylindrical, and commonly surrounded with bristles. In the relaxed state, they commonly he in a Pouch under the Skin of the Tail. They are erected by the power of the Muscles of the Tail, and appear at the sides of the Cloaca. Two Retractors from the first Vertebra of the Tail return them to their natural situa- tion in the Pouch. The Rattlesnake and Viper have also double Fames, each of which is bifid, and beset with bristles. In

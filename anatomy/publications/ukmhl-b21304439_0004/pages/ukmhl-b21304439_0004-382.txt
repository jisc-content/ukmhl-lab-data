582 OF ZOOPHYTES. [Part IX. The different Organs of the Senses are not demon- strable here, though, as in the Vermes, Zoophytes are to be considered as possessing Senses adapted to their manner of living. Vascular System.â€”In the Echinus, two Vessels run along the Intestines, one considered as an Aorta, the other a Vena Cava, but without any visible Heart. From these a Plexus runs off, to be distributed upon the Intestines and Mesentery. Something of the same kind is to be observed in the Asterias. I In the Echinus, there is a set of Tubes, considered by Dr Monro as Absorbents, which have a visible Muscular structure, and without Valves. The outer end of each of the Tubes has a flat plate, by which the Ani- mal adheres when it fixes upon any object. In the middle of the plate is an orifice, which imbibes the sea-water, that is conducted to Vessels in the inner part of the Shell. Each of the Ducts perforates the Shell by two Foramina; and the different Foramina are pla- ced in five pairs of parallel lines, called by Naturalists Ambulacra, from their similarity to alleys in a garden. Upon the inner side of the Shell, they run to two ranges of Laminae, composed of Plexus of Vessels, from each of which a Duct runs to a large Tube, which receives all the Absorbents of one of the double ranges. The large l ube terminates in Reservoirs over the Sockets of the Teeth, through which it is supposed, that after a se- cretion has been made, the fluid absorbed is returned to the sea.

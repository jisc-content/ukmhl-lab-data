OF THE BRAIN, he. [Part 1\ 304 as the Tail Fin. Upon the Head, the Duct divides into Branches, which spread out upon the two Jaws. From this Duct a number of short Tubes arise, and terminate by openings upon the surface of the Skin, Cuvier describes these Ducts as arising from two Glands placed on the Head, above each Orbit. OF THE BRAIN, 'l he appearance ot the Evciin differs much in the dif- ferent Species. It is always remarkably small in pro- portion to the size of the Body, though the Nerves aic as large, when compared with the parts on which they are distributed, as in the former'classes. The Brain here never fills the Cranium, there being always a large space occupied by a salt fluid, contained in loose Cellular substance, which surrounds the Brain, and supplies the place of the T. umca Arachnoidea. The Brain, in Fishes, somewhat resembles that in Birds, only the posterior bear a greater proportion to- the anterior parts, and there is often a Tubercle behind, forming a kind of second Cerebellum, and which is pe- culiar to Fishes. The Brain, in general, is divided into Cerebrum and Cerebellum, and these have their Ventricles somewhat us in Mammalia. The Lobes are more numerous than

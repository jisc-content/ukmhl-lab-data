These are found under the Skin of the crop; but the greater part of this substance is discharged, by one or more orifices, from a Gland si- tuated upon the ltump. With the contents of this, the Duelâ€™, by means of the Bill, frequently besmears the Feathers. The Feathers are wanting in young Birds. When they first leave the Egg, they are covered with hair, formed into Fasciculi, each of which grows from a common Bulb, that gives origin to the future Feathers. The Hair is soon succeeded by Sheaths, giving pas- sage to the Feathers, the inner ends of which are sup- plied with Blood-vessels, that form first the Barrel, then the Stalk of the Quill.

The Stalk is convex on one side, and concave, and furrowed in the middle, on the other.

OF THE LARYNX, kc. (Part I. (44 Ligaments there is a large passage in each side, some- thing in the form of a Ventricle, leading to a great Sac, most, part of which is covered by the Thyroid and Ary- tenoid Muscles. Behind the Base of the Epiglottis there is also a Foramen, leading to a cavity situated under the anterior edge of the Thyroid Cartilage, but having no1 communication with the Lateral Sacs. â€˜ The Ass has the same kind of Falciform Membrane with the Horse, and the same number of Touches or Sacs, but their Mouths are smaller; while the middle Pouch in the Ass is sensibly larger than in the Horse, and is the part from which the sound is considered to come in braying.

The Anterior Sac in the Mule is larger than in the Ass. Ruminants have a simple Larynx. The Arytenoid Cartilages are cun ed back, and form more than half of the Glottis. Their inner surfaces touch each other. There are neither Anterior Ligaments nor Ventricles in some of the individuals of this order, as the Ox and Sheep. In some of the Deer kind, a passage is found at the Base of the Epiglottis, which leads to a Sac similar to that of the Ape tribe, and is in them situated between the Epiglottis and Thyroid Cartilage. The Pio- has two Bags situated above or before the Ligaments of the Glottis, which occasion the grunting Of the Animal. In the Elephant the Epiglottis reaches behind the Posterior'

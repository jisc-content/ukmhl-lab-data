Omnivorous Animals, also, as the Monkey, Rat, and Hog, have generally a large Caecum tacked up into Cells Man, the Ourang-outang, and the Pliascolome, (a New Holland Rat), are the only Animals yet found with a Caecum and Appendix Vermiformis distinct. In most others, there is a Caecum without an Appendix. in some Ant-eaters, two small Caeca: in other Animals, only an Appendix ; and many have neither the one nor the other. In Animals without a Caecum,' the Intestines are every where nearly equal in diameter, contracting only in a small degree towards the extremity of the Rec- tum. The number of the Coats in the Intestines, in Mam- malia, are the same as in the Stomach, varying in thickness and strength according to the size of the Ca- nal, and the manner of living of the Animal. The Mus- cular Coat is generally stronger. The Valvulae Conniventes of the small Intestines are much less distinct in most of the Animals of this class, particularly the Carnivora, than in Man and the Monkey tribe. In some, however, even of the Herbivorous kind, they are entirely wanting. The Villi are always present, and generally more evi- dent than in Man. The Papillae are very distinct upon the inner side of the Intestines in many Mammalia. In the Seal, they are remarkably conspicuous, and are found

OF REPTILES. 291 Part III.] projections in each side, one pierced by the Ureter, the other by the Vas Deferens. From the above it appears the Bladder exists in the Turtle; in many Lizards, though not in all; in Serpents; and that, in Frogs, there are receptacles considered by some as a Bladder, and by others as of a different nature. Near the Kidneys, but unconnected with them, are two small Bodies, considered by some as Renal Glands, by others, as connected with the Organs of Generation. Cuvier looks upon them as a kind of Omentum. In the Turtle, they are attached to the Renal Veins. In Lizards and Serpents, they are in a ply of the Perito- neum, connecting the Ova and Oviducts. In the Frog, they are fringed Bodies, like the Testes or Ovaria, and fixed to the Emulgent Veins. OF THE MALE ORGANS OF GENE- RATION The situation of the Testes in the different orders of this class, is very analogous to that in Birds, being con- stantly m the Abdomen, in the vicinity of the Kidneys. In the Turtles, Lizards, and Serpents, they are variable in their form, and are fasciculated. In Frogs, they are like Granulag closely connected. The Epididymis varies in figure and size in the diffe- rent tribes. As in Birds, the Vas Deferens, coming- out from it, terminates in the Cloaca.' In the Turtle, T 2 the

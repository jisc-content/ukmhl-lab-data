281 Part III.] OF REPTILES. OF Here, as in Birds, the Lymphatics of the Viscera of Digestion and Generation, and those of the Posterior Extremities, join in a Plexus, into which all the other Lymphatics of the Body pass. From this Plexus a short Canal goes out, on each side, which terminates in the Jugular Veins, or in the angles they form with the Subclavian s. In the Pur tie, the Absorbents of the posterior parts of the Body go to a Plexus, which surrounds the Right Aorta, and then into a Reservoir situated more for- wards, under the Left Aorta. From this, two Thoracic Ducts, or rather several principal Branches, arise, which advance to those under the Clavicles. Here they join with the Lymphatics of the Anterior Extremi- ties, anti o 1 the Head and Neck, and form two very in- tricate Plexus. From the Plexus of the right side, two Branches go out, which terminate in the Jugular Vein, near the angle it forms with the Subclavian. The Left sends out but a single Duct, that opens into the angle of the two \ eins. The Absorbents under the Perito- neal Coat of the Intestines, run in straight parallel Branches, according to the length of the Bowel; and a good injection shews them to cover almost the whole surface of the Gut. The inner surface is no less plen- tifully supplied with them, though here they have more the appearance of small Cells. from the Intestines, they go in company with the Mesenteric Blood-vessels, and form frequent Plexus and communications. At length they anastomose with the Absorbents of the other parts of the Abdomen, and discharge their contents into the Thoracic Ducts.

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 123 are t The Front Teeth of the Upper Jaw are fixed in the Intermaxillary Bone, which includes also the Tusks of the Elephant, Walrus, and Normal. The number and form of the Teeth varies considera- bly in different Mammalia. In the Glires, the cutting edges of the Incisores are in the form of a Chizel. The Teeth of some Animals, as the Glires, are co- vered with Enamel only on their anterior surface, but this is continued along the roots; hence, as the Osseous part wears down sooner than the Enamel, the Animal is still capable of gnawing hard substances. The Teeth of the Glires, the Tusks of th Elephant and Hippopotamus, and others of a similar nature, are in a constant state of growth, in consequence of a Pulpy Vascular Substance within them, upon which the Os- seous part of the Tooth is formed ; so that the interior part of the Tooth advances to supply the portion worn down. The Teeth of the Lower Jaw of some of the Ani- mals of this order, as the Squirrel, Rat, and Beaver, are remarkable for the length of their roots, which nearly equals that of the Jaw itself, though a small por- tion only appears beyond the Gums. They are curved back under the roots of the Grinders, and sometimes go as far as the Coronoid Processes. The Tusk of the Normal occupies the place of an Incisor, and is almost constantly found single, the other one being either early destroyed, or lurking in the Jaw.

OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Fart T. 12Q In the Cetacea, the Velum is changed into a Canal, by which the Posterior Nares are prolonged about the pyramid ot the Larynx, and their posterior part conti- nued with the Pharynx. Pharynx.—The Pharynx, in Mammalia in general, has nearly the same structure as in Man, but stronger on account of the necessary force required in their ho- rizontal situation. It exists in all Vertebral Animals, but particularly in Mammalia. In many, as the Ele- pliant, Bear, &c. there is a proper Pharyngeal Muscle, which is merely a continuation of the Muscular Coat of tlie Esophagus. Burscc Faucium.—Many Species of the Ape, and also of the Marmot, are provided with Glandular Sacs, or Cheek Pouches, termed Burscc Faucium, placed behind the Palate, and serving as a temporary reservoir for the Food. The Camel has this structure also, which is supposed lo he intended for containing fluids to lubricate the Throat in the sandy deserts. The Ormthorrynchus is also found to have Check Pouches. In the Cetacea, the Pharynx is separated into two by the Larynx, which forms a pyramid that can rise as high as the Posterior Nares, and, by entering these, can allow the aliment to pass by each side of it to the Esophagus. There is also a particular Canal which rises from the Pharynx, and is attached to the margin of the Posterior Nares, or Blowing Holes. The cir- cular Fibres of this Canal form a Sphincter, which, by contracting round the Pyramid, cuts off the communi- cation

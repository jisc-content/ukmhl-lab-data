308 OF THE BRAIN, &c. [Paiit IV. There is no Diaphragmatic Nerve, though one of the first Vertebral Nerves is spent upon the partition between the Cavity of the Branchiae and that of the Abdomen. The Dorsal and Lumbar Nerves are all distributed in the Intercostal spaces. The Sacral and Caudal Nerves are not very distinct; they are lost in the posterior part of the Body and the Tail Fin. Besides the Nerves mentioned above, it is here thought proper to take notice of those which belong, in certain Electrical Fishes, to that curious apparatus which performs the office of a Leyden Jar, or Electrical Battery. The Raja Torpedo, Gymnotus Electricus, and Silurm Electricus, are the only Fishes in which Electri- cal Organs have been discovered ; though one Species of the Tctraodon, and one of the Trichinrus, possess the same electric property. In the three first-named Ani- mals, the Electric Organ consists of Aponeurotic Cells, filled with a fluid like the Claire of an Lgg. Upon this substance large Nerves are distributed ; but the proportional size and the structure of the Cells, the ori- gin, number, and relative magnitude of the Nerves, vary in the three'different Species. The Electrical Organ of the Torpedo bears a large proportion to the Body of the Animal, and is situated between the Head, the Branchiae, and great Cartilage of the Pectoral Fin in each side; or in that part from whence the Mucous Ducts issue as from a centre, pn the Back of the Skate. It extends in a perpendicular direction from the Dorsal to the Abdominal Skin. When the Integuments are raised, the Organ appears, consisting 1

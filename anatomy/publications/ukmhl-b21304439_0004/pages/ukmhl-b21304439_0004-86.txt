OF THE BRAIN [Faux I. so The .The proportional breadth of the Brain to that of the Medulla Oblongata, is, with few exceptions, greater in Man than in other Mammalia. In Man, it is as 7 to I ; in Apes, from as 4 to 1 to as 5 to 1 ; in the Dog, as II to 6; in the Cat, as 11 to 4; in the Horse, as 21 to 8; in the Ox, as 13 to 5 ; in the Deer, as 5 to 2^ in the Dolphin, as 13 to 1. The Falx of the Dura Mater, in Mammalia, is smaller in proportion than in Man; the Hemispheres being less in danger of injuring each other. It Is of different breadths in different Animals. In a few individuals of the class, as the Ornithorrynchus and Porpoise, it is partly Osseous. The Tento- rium in Quadrupeds is proportionally broader than in Man ; and in many, particularly the Carnivora, it contains in its substance a plate of Bone. In the Cat and Bear kind, this plate is in one piece; in the Horse, Dog, and Seal, in three. The Osseous Tento- rium is commonly considered as obviating the effects of concussion, though it is found in some Animals of slow, as well as in those of quick motion. The Falx Minor is wanting in Quadrupeds. rlhe other two Membranes of the Brain are similar to those in the Human Spe- cies. The form of the Brain varies in different Animals. In the Ape tribe, it is oval, as in Man ; in Carnivora, and some others, as the Hare and Babbit, it is narrower anteriorly ; others have the Cerebrum almost round. In the Dolphin, it is remarkable, in being twice as broad from one side to the other, as from before back- wards.

195 OF MAMMALIA, Part I.] The Umbilical Cord is observed to be proportionally shorter in Quadrupeds than in the Human Species, in most of them, there are two Umbilical Veins, united into a Trunk near, or within the Body of the Foetus. In the Foal, the Cord has only a single Vein. Of thf F<etus, and Organs which nourish it for SOME TIME AFTER DELIVERY. The peculiarities of the Foetal Quadruped, with re- spect to structure, are not much different from those in the Child at the end of pregnancy. The number of young produced, at a time, varies ac- cording to the kind, and is observed to be greater in tame than in wild Animals, as in the Sow and Cat. The Whale produces only a single Foetus, and once in two years. In suckling, she turns almost on her back, on the rim of the water. The nourishment of the Foetus, in Mammalia, is derived from the Motherâ€™s Milk, which is secreted from the Mamma, and is peculiar to the Animals of this class. The situation and structure of the Mamma vary ac- cording to the number of Foetuses which the Animal pro- duces at a time. In Uniparous Animals, they are generally situated between the Hind Legs. In the Multiparous, they extend, in some, along the Abdomen, and in others, also along the l horax. The Mamma is sur- rounded with less Fat in proportion than in Women ; hence not bulky, till distended with Milk. T. he situation and number of the Teats projecting N 2 from

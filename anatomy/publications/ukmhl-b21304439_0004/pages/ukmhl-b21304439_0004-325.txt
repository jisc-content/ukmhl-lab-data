One, deep-seated, belongs to the parts about the Spine and upper portion of the Head, and receives Branches from the Dorsal tins and parts of the Back ; and a large Vessel, or Plexus of Vessels, belongs to the Gills, Mouth, Brain, and Organs of the Senses. The principal Lacteals run in the Mesentery, near the Arteries, communicating there by innumerable trans- verse Canals, but are smaller in proportion to the Blood-vessels than in the former tribe of Fishes. At the Anterior part of the Abdomen, the Lympha- tics of the Stomach and Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera are added to the Lacteals. The conjoined Vessels pass to a large Reservoir at the right side of the posterior extremity of the Esophagus. From this Reservoir, large Absorbents, sometimes considered as analogous to Tho- racic Ducts, go forwards, receiving, in their course, the Lymphatics of the Organs of Urine and Generation, and run into a large Cellular Receptacle on each side, situated chiefly between the Cartilage analogous to the Clavicle, and the undermost Gill. These Receptacles receive also the Lymph from the five principal Vessels mentioned above, and from the various other parts of the Body. The two Receptacles communicate together by cross Canals, which run principally behind the Heart and Esophagus. In the Salmon, each Receptacle sends out a Duct, which terminates in the anterior extremity of the Pos- terior Cava of that side, at the fore and outer part of the Internal Jugular Vein. X 3 At

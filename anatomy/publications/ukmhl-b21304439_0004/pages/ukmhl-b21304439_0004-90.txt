90 [Part I. OF THE BRAIN, &c. after the Medullary Substance is dissolved by macera- tion, the remaining parts, by being inflated, appear like so many distinct Canals. The Third Pair goes through a hole appropriated to it, when there is no Sphenoid Fissure, either singly, or in company with some of the other Nerves of the Eye, and is distributed as in Man. The Fourth, also, is as in Man. The Fifth, as in the Human Species, is also divided into three Branches, and these are larger or smaller, according to the form of the different parts of the Face. In Carnivorous Animals, as the Tiger, the second and third portions of this Nerve appear to be uncommonly large. The Sixth Pair, as in the Human Body, is bathed in Blood; and, while in the Cavernous Sinus, it is con- nected by one, two, or more Branches with the Great Sympathetic. The Seventh, as in Man, divides into the Portio Dura and Portio Mollis. The former differs according to the form and extent of the different parts of the Face upon which it is dispersed. The Portio Mollis, as in Man, is entirely spent in the Labyrinth of the Ear. The Eighth and Ninth are dispersed nearly as in Man. The Great Sympathetic Nerve has nearly the same connexion in the Cranium with the Fifth and Sixth Pairs,—the same connexion in its course with the Nerves near it,—and forms the same kind of Ganglia, as in Man; only varying a little in the number ol •Filaments sent off", or in the form of the Ganglia.

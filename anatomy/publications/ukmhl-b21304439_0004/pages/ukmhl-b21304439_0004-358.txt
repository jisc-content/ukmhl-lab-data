The Stomach is situated in the Thorax above the Mouth, and, from its particular structure, is prevented from contracting and dilating like the Stomach of other Animals. The small Intestine is straight and cylindri- cal, but, towards its middle, it has a strong Valve and , a long Caecum. Liver, c$*c.—The greater part of this class have no proper Liver. The Bile is derived from a collection of Intestinula Caeca, similar to those which supply the place of Pancreas in Osseous Fishes. They are of a yellow colour, and contain a bitter brown fluid, which they discharge into the beginning of the Intestine. These, together with the Stomach, fill almost the whole of the Thorax, the former composing the high-flavour- ed substance in the Crab and Lobster. Shrimps have a Liver of a different nature from that of other Crustacea ; being a solid Conglomerate Gland, arranged along the two sides o£ the Intestines, through their whole length. Organs of Generation.—Here the Testes in the Male, and Ovaria in the Female, are in some united together, and their External Organs are double. In the Crab, Lobster, &c. the Male has two Penises, and the Female two Vulvae. In the Male, the Testes are two Glandular-like Bo- dies, separate in the Crab, but united in the Lobster, and here placed under the Heart. From the flestes, two convoluted Vasa Deferentia pass out, which end in k. corresponding Penis behind the Fifth Pair of beet. Each

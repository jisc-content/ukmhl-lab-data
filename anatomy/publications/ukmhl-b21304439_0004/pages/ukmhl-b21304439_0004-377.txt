Hydatids immersed in warm water, immediately after being obtained from a living Animal, are observed to have a contractile power, but they have no external opening. They are of different sizes and kinds; most commonly there is either one or more Hydatids floating in the same Cyst. Each con- sists of two Coats, the inner of which is extremely de- licate. Neither of them possesses any visible Blood-ves- sels, though the Sac containing them has abundance of Vessels, Nerves, Szc. derived from those of the Organ with which it is connected. Hydatids ought not to be con- founded with watery Vesicles, connected occasionally with the Kidney, &c. which ar not inclosed in Cysts, have no small Hydatids adhering to their inner surface, and want contractility. In other Animals, a Hydatid is found, with a Head and Mouth, by which it adheres to the inner surface of the Sac which incloses it. In the Leech, the Sexes are double in each individual, and they have reciprocal copulation. The Male parts consist of two Testes, each formed of a convoluted Duct. A short Vas Deferens, ending in a kind of Pe- nis, is observed at the under side, near the anterior ex- tremity. In the vicinity of this there is a Vagina, which seems to receive the Penis of the other individual. The Lunbrici Intcstinorum have distinct Sexes. In the Male, a thread-likeâ€¢'Vessel, four or five times the length of the Animal, much convoluted, but easily un- ravelled, composes the Testes. This forms a Vesicula Seminalis, which is equal to upwards of a third part of the length of the Body, and is sometimes nearly as large as a crow-quill, full of a milky liquor. The Vesicula ends

The Skin of the Hedge-liog possesses a curious com- plex Muscle. It is of an oval form, and is placed along the Back, adhering closely to the Skin, and even to the roots of the Prickles or Spines. It sends slips to the Face, to the under parts of the Throat, Thorax, and Abdo- men, and to the lateral parts of the Tail. By the con- traction of these slips, assisted by the Flexor Muscles of the Head and Trunk of the Body, the Animal, when in danger, can coil itself up as in a Sac. It re- turns to its ordinary posture, by acting with the middle part of the Cutaneous Muscle, the other parts becom- ing relaxed, so as to leave the lower parts of the Body, the Hands, and the Feet free.

Muscles of the Eye and Ear.—They will be noticed afterwards in the description of these Organs. Muscles of the Nose and Mouth.—In Apes, the Nose is affected by a continuation of the Panniculus Carno- sus. In Carnivora, as the Dog, the Nose is moved by the Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi, that covers the Cheek, and the Depressor Ala; Nasi, which is small. In Animals with projecting moveable Snouts, as the Bear and the Mole, the Cartilaginous Tube of the Nose is moveable in every direction on the end of the Osseous

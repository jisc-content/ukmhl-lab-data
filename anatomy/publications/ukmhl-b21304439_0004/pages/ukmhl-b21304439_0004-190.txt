190 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Faux f. of In a few, as the Hyena, Dolphin, and Porpoise, the Rugae run transversely, but exist only at the outer half of the Canal. In large Animals, the walls of the Va- gina, according to Cuvier, possess Muscular Fibres, which run both in a longitudinal and in a transverse di- rection. In the Omithorrynchus, there is no Vagina. Vulva.â€”This, in some Animals, as the Rat, forms a longitudinal slit; in others, as the Hyena, it passes transversely. In some of the Glires, it is of a circular form, and sometimes, especially in Animals with a Pouch, it is inclosed with the Anus in a circle. The existence of a Hymen in Quadrupeds, resem- bling in form and situation that of the Human Subject, is asserted by some late Authors of the first eminence, and denied by others of equal celebrity. In the Dog, Cat, Ruminants, &c. the Vagina is se- parated from the Vulva, by a contracted circle, and in other Animals, by one or more Plicae, which are found to be effaced by coition, or by one or more litters. In the Rear, Hyena, Mare, and Ass, never yet covered, a strong Semilunar Fold appears in the under part of the orifice of the Vagina, which has been considered by some as analogous to a Hymen, though this is no very strict resemblance to that in the Human Female. At the under end of the Vulva, the Urethra is com- monly situated, and appears at the outer orifice of the Vagina, though, in many Animals, the orifice of the Urethra is a considerable way in from the Vulva. The Nymphee are wanting in Mammalia; but the want of them is supplied, in coition, by the quantity of Blood which distends the Vessels at this time. In place

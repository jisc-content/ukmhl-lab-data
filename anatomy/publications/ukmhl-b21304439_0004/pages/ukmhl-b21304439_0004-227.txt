Some Predaceous and Swimming Birds, and most of the Parrot kind, have a soft Tongue, covered with Pa- pillae, and moistened with Mucus, to enable them to select proper Aliment. In the Parroquet, it is fleshy, very thick, and rounded before. Nocturnal Birds of Prey have it also fleshy, with soft Papillae turned back- ward. In the Gallinacea, the Tongue is triangular, pointed, smooth, Cartilaginous, and destitute of Papillae, except- ing at its root; its firmness preventing it from being in- juied by the hard and pointed substances upon which they live. In the Duclc kind, it is fleshy and large, but in seve- ral of these, it is furnished with ranges of Osseous La- mina ; and almost all the kinds have rigid Hairs upon the sides. In the Swan, it is covered with stiff Hairs, Osseous Plates, and Fleshy Papilla; and some of these substan- ces are directed backward. In many, as the Toucan, the Tongue is of a Horny consistence, like a piece of Whale-bone; in the Pie, it is forked, or divided into two parts; in the Ostrich, of a semilunar form, and remarkably short; in the Pelican, so short, that its ex- istence has been by many denied. Ihe nature of the Tongue is more remarkable in the Mood-cod: and Wood-pecker, than in many other Animals cof this class. In the Wood-cock, the Tongue, and also the Larynx, are placed deep in the Esophagus, and the ^former can be elevated by Muscles peculiar to it, P 2

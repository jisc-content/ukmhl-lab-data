The Tail is a strong moveable substance, employed particularly in swimming and leaping, and has power- ful Muscles for moving it in various directions. The Feet vary in number and form in the different Genera. In the Genus Cancer, as an example, there are commonly five Feet on each side, with six joints to each Foot. The anterior is the largest, and forms the Pincer, or Claw. The first of the pieces of the anterior Foot, is the Coxa, which is connected to the Thorax ; the second the Femur, which is nearly of a square form, and moves as a hinge on the Coxa; the third is the Tibia, which, at the under extremity, becomes broad and Spinous; the fourth is connected to the Tibia; the fifth is the Pincer, strictly so called, which is the largest of the whole, and has opposed to it the sixth, which forms a moveable Pollex or Thumb. The other Feet are like the Pincer, but differ in this, that the two last pieces are nearly of equal size. The two Posterior Feet terminate each in a single Claw. Each articulation of the Feet has two Muscles, an Extensor and a Flexor, the strength varying according to the force required. Nervous System.â€”This varies according to the form and nature of the Animal. In the Lobster, there is a Nervous Cord, which has a knotted appearance, and extends from one end of the Body to the other. The short-tailed Cancer, or Crab, has a Medullary Circle in the middle of the Abdomen, from which the nerves of the Body go off like Radii. In the Cray Fish, the Z 2 Brain

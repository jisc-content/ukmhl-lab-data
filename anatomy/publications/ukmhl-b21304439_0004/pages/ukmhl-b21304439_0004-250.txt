250 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part II. closed by a Process of the Peritoneum, which attaches it to the Spine. It consists of a cluster of Ova, resem- bling' a bunch of grapes, but varying in size, from the full-grown yoke to that of a grain of mustard-seed. rpÂ£jg largest are yellow, the smallest white, and in a Hen beginning for the first time to lay, the number is about 500. The Ovaria have Blood-vessels similar to those of Mammalia, which also assist in fixing them in their place. The largest of the Yolks are always found at the outer side. Each is inclosed in a Calyx, or Membrane, and supported on a Pedicle, or Foot-stalk, which is fixed to the Ovariurti. When the Yolk is ripe, it bursts the Membrane, and is then received by the Infundibulum, which conveys it to the Oviduct. The Infundibulum has a plaited or folded margin, like the Fimbriae of the Fallopian Tube, and is connected behind by a round Ligament. I lie Oviduct is at first straight, but afterwards so convolut- ed, as frequently to exceed the length of the Bird, and gradually increases in thickness and strength, till it reaches the Cloaca. Externally, it is covered by the Peritoneum, within which are some Muscular fibres. The inner side is formed by a Membrane covered with Follicles, which secrete the white of the Egg. It has a number of broad longitudinal folds, and is connected to the Spine by a kind of Mesentery. The Oviduct terminates, and deposites the Egg, in the Uterus, which is full of wrinkles internally, and irav he considered as merely a dilated part ol the Or i , duct. I

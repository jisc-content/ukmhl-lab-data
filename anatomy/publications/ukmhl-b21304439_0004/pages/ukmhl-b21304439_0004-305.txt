Part IV.] OF FISHES. 30-5 in the former class, but there is great variety in different Fishes. The Cerebrum constantly forms two Lobes or Hemi- spheres, which are laid by the sides of each other, and are smooth and without convolutions. The Cerebellum is in one Lobe, and larger in proportion than the Hemi- spheres, often surpassing them in size. Each of the Hemispheres has a Ventricle, with a kind of Corpus Striatum ; and there is also something like a Third and Fourth Ventricle, as in Mammalia. The Thalami Optici are constantly situated, as in Birds, under the Hemispheres, and, as in them also, each contains a Ventricle. There are no distinct Tubercula Quadrigemina, unless ri ubercles situated under the Hemispheres, in some Fishes, are taken for such. The Nerves, as already noticed, do not bear proportion to the size of the Brain, but to that of the parts to which they are destined. They differ from the Nerves of the Animals of the former classes, in having no Ganglia, though in the Genera Oyprinus and Gailus, something like Ganglia are found in the Olfactory Nerves. In certain Fishes of the Genus Gadus, as Cod, Had- dock, and Whiting, there are numerous small roundish Bodies, contained in little Vesicles on the surface of the Brain, on the anterior extremity of the Spinal Mar- low, and on some of the principal Nerves, and within the Skin covering the Fins. These are described by Dr Monro in his Work on Fishes, but their use is un- known. Voi.IV. IT The

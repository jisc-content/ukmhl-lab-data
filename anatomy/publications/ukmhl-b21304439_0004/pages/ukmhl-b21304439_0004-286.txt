The 28G OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part III. the former class of Animals. In some of the Turtle kind, it is about five times the length of the Animal; but in some other Reptiles, as the Frog, it is scarcely twice ; and in some of the Serpent tribe, as the Coluber Matrix, it is not equal to the length of the Creature. The Small Intestines are generally much contracted in their diameter, while the large are as much dilated, though sometimes the reverse, as in the Hazck's-bill Turtle. In Turtles, in Lizards, in the Frog tribe, and Snakes, there is a Vermiform Process, but rarely any Caecum. Almost the whole of this class have a Circu- lar Fold or Valve between the small and great Intes- tines. The inner part of the Canal has Plicae, varying in the different kinds, and is lined with a large quantity of Mucus. Injthe Tortoise, there are no Cells in the great In- testines ; but the Canal in this, and some other Ani- mals of the class, is full of Fossulae. In Lizards, and in the Frog and Toad, the Colon is cylindrical, and much larger than the small Intestines In some of the Lizards, as the Crocodile of the Nile, the Plicae of the small Intestines have a zig-zag appearance. In the Chameleon, the small Guts equal the size of the Colon ; and in the Crocodile, the Colon little exceeds the small Intestines. In Snakes, the small Intestines are serpentine, and nearly equal in size with the Colon. I hey have longi- tudinal Plicae, while the Colon has irregular Rugae. The Intestinal Canal, in Reptiles, terminates in a Cloaca, which is nearly of the same nature as in Birds.

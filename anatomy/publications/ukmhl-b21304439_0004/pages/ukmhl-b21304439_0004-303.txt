They are shut at their origin, have no visible Glands, nor have they any evident communication with each other. Each has an opening of considerable size upon the surface of the Body, where they pour out clear slime in large quantities, to defend the Skin, which, in Animals of this kind, is less scaly than in others. Upon the beginning of these Canals, where they issue from a centre, a large Nerve, the third Branch of the fifth pair, is dispersed in radiated Branches, which become suddenly transparent, and vanish in the Coats of the Ducts. Upon the under surface of these same kind of Fishes, there are also Mucous Ducts, of a similar nature with the former, but more irregular in their course. Besides the Ducts mentioned above, there are others, much larger, upon the inferior or ventral surface, which like- wise discharge Mucus for the defence of the Skin. They are situated at the sides of the Mouth, and upon the La- teral Fins, and take a serpentine direction. In the Torpedo, the Mucous Ducts are less in number than in the Skate, See. and they only receive part of the numerous Filaments of Nerves which go to the former Ducts, the larger portion being spent upon the Electric Organ of this Animal. In Osseous Fishes, as the Cod, Haddock, Sec. the Mucus comes from a Linea Lateralis, or Duct on each side of the Body and Head, and extending as far back

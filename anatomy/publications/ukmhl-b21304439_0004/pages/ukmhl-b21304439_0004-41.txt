41 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. / Ossa Malarum not being articulated with the Os Fron- tis, nor Os Sphenoides, but only contributing to form the Zygomatic Arches and the inferior edges of the Or- bits; in the Orbits not being inclosed below and be- hind, but communicating with the Temporal Fossae; in the Ossa Palati forming a considerable proportion of the inner part of the Orbits, and supplying the want of an Os Planum of the Ethmoid Bone. The Lower Jaw of Quadrupeds deviates particularly from that of man, in being destitute of a Clnn, and is also longer in proportion to the Cranium. The Con- dyles are found to vary according to the nature ot the Food the Animal has to manducate, and the strength of the Muscles fixed to the Jaw. In the Ferae, they are so locked in by the fore and back parts of their Articu- lar Cavities, that rotatory motion is entirely prevented ; the Jaw moving only in a vertical direction, which is all that is necessary for the tearing and cutting of Animal Substances. In many Herbivorous Animals they are rounded, for admitting motion in every direction, so as to adapt them for grinding the Food. In many of the Glircs they are parallel to each other, and placed in a longitudinal direction, by which the Incisores of the Lower Jaw can move horizontally, and advance or re- cede upon those of the Upper Jaw, so as to break the hard substances upon which these Animals frequently live. In many of the Mammalia, as the Feres, &c. the lateral portions of the Jaw are connected by Cartilage for life; but in the Ape tribe, Horned Cattle, &c. they are united into one piece. The most singular form of this

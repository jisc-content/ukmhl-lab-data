The Os Hyoides varies much in this and the other orders of the class, though in general it approaches, in its appearance, to that of Birds. Seven Vertebra? enter into the composition of the Neck. The Trunk is formed of two great portions, the Dorsal and Abdominal Shells. The Dorsal, Lum- bar, and Sacral Vertebrae, are all united into one piece, but the \ ertebrae of the Tail are free and moveable. The Dorsal Shell consists oi a great number of Os- seous Plates, regular in their position, and approaching to a quadrangular form. They are connected to each other by Suture, and joined to the Abdominal Shell by a thick and very tough Skin. The Abdominal Shell, like the Dorsal, is also com- posed ot many plates joined together by Suture, and forming a kind of Sternum, which covers almost the whole inferior part of the Body of the Animal.

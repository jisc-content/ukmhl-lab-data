[Taut II. OF THE LIVER, &c. ,'246 plies of the Mesentery, as in the former class. As in Mammalia, it is destitute of an Excretory Duct, and as in that class of Animals also, it sends its Blood to the Liver, by which part of the Bile is secreted from it.

It commonly sends one, two, or three Ducts, which arc more visible than in other Animals; and these, with few exceptions, termi- nate distinct from the Biliary Vessels. Of the Insertion of the Biliary and Pancreatic Ducts there is great variety; but from many comparisons it appears, that the Pancreatic Duct opens first into the Intestine, that the Hepatic is inserted a little farther on, and that at a little distance farther is the termination of the Ductus Câ€™ysticus. Kidneys. / % The Kidneys, which are proportionally large in this class, are placed in the Cavities of the Ossa Innommata, at the sides of the Lumbar Vertebrae, with a few excep- tions.

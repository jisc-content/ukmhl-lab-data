OF BIRDS. 221 Part II.] Of number in different Birds, and is of a conical form, very Vascular, and covered with a black paint. In the Ostrich and Cassowary, it forms a kind of conical purse, whence the French term it Bourse Noire. It is sup- posed to absorb rays of light when too strong, or when the Animal attempts to look at near objects. And. some have considered it as serving to move the Lens; but Muscular Fibres have not been detected in it, and its oblique situation is also unfavourable to this. The Humours of the Eye are analogous to those in the former class. The Lens is flatter or rounder, in an inverse ratio to that of the Cornea. In Land Birds* it is flat, as in Mammalia; in the Aquatic, it is more of a globular form. The Muscles of the Eye, in Birds, are the same in number as in the Human Body ; but both the Obliqui come from the fore part of the Orbit, near each other. One is inserted below, the other above, without going through a pulley, as in Mammalia. The whole Muscles of the Ball are fixed to the soft part of the Sclerotic* behind the Osseous Laminae, and are shorter in pro- portion than in the former class. This, together with the flat shape of the Ball, allows very little motion. The Suspensory Muscle existing in Quadrupeds, is wanting in Birds.

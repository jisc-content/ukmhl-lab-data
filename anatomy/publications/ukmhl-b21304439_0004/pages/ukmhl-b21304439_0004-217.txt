Part II.] OF BIRDS. 217 the Nerves are generally sent off from it by anterior and posterior bundles of Fibres, as in Mammalia. The Cervicals are analogous to those of the former class of Animals, but the number corresponds with that of the Vertebrae. They go chiefly to the Neck, only one or two of the last assisting in the formation of the Brachial Plexus. The Diaphragmatic Nerves, like the Diaphragm it- self, are wanting. The Dorsals and Lumbars correspond with those in Mammalia, and the number with that of the Verte- brae. The Brachial Plexus is chiefly formed by the last Cervical and two first Dorsals, and is large, having to supply the Pectoral Muscles of great size, which, are inserted into the Wings. The Nerves of the Abdominal or Inferior Extremities are nearly as in Mammalia. 1 he Anterior Crural is sent off from the three last Lumb: rs, from which also the Obturator comes. The Sciatic is chiefly formed by the four Superior or Anterior Pelvic Pairs, and divided somewhat as in Mammalia, the last Branches dividing into others according to the number of the Toes. OF TIIE EYE. The Eyes are larger in the individuals of this class, in proportion to the size of the Scull, than in Mammalia, and

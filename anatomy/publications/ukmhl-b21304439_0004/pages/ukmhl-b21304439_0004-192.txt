Vdi or THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part I. internal and external parts, and prevents the lips of the' Womb from growing together. The Corpora Lutea are found after impregnation/ and, in the Coxa in particular, are large and of a yellow colour; but in other Animals, the colour varies accord- ing to the kind. The Muscular Fibres in the Gravid Uterus become less distinct than in the unimpregnated state. The changes of the simple Uterus without Horns, or that belonging to the Ape tribe, &c. considerably resemble those in Woman. In the Uterus with Horns, the changes are accord- ing to the number of Foetuses the Mother carries. In Uniparous Animals, as the Mare, the Foetus is confined to the Uterus. I'n the Coxo, it extends from the Uterus to one of the Cornua. In Multiparous A- riimals, one or more Foetuses are contained in each Horn; in which last case, the Cornua, by their alter- nate contractions and dilatations, are formed into Cells. The Uterus Anfractuosus has the thinnest Coats of any, and suffers the least change by Impregnation. In the Kangaroo after Impregnation, the communication be- tween the Vagina and Lateral Canals is completely shut up by inspissated Mucus. A minute orifice is describ- ed as being now close to the Urethra, and communicat- ing with the Uterus, though no opening is found here in the Virgin state. 1 his, dilating at the time of par- turition, is found to discharge the Foetus into the Pouch or False Belly ; the parts, after delivery, re- turning to their original state. In the Opossum, the changes by Impregnation are not yet ascertained. The connection between the impregnated Uterus and surface

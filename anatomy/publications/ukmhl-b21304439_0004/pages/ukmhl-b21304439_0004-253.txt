The influence of the Male Semen is supposed to af- fect the Ovum either in the Uterus, or to pass through the Tube, and fecundate the Ova in the V olk-bag, but in what manner is not yet understood. During Incubation, the Folliculus Aeris is gradually expanded, air being now secreted from surrounding Vessels, which prevents the Chick from being too much moved about in the Shell. The Albumen becomes thinner and more turbid, part of it escapes through the Shell by evaporation, the rest of it is by degrees con- sumed by the Chick, till at last there remains but a white Cretaceous Substance at the small end of the Shell. The white of a fecundated Egg is somewhat coagu- lable, and perfectly fresh, during the whole period of hatching. The Yolk becomes paler and more fluid for some time, on account of being mixed with the white. Its Membranes become firmer and stronger. By de- grees it becomes depressed in the middle, and forms an Arch about the Chick. It remains quite free from cor- ruption, is coagulable all the time of Incubation, and, during this period, is entirely taken into the Abdomen. The Chalazae degenerate into a chalky-like substance towards the end of Incubation, The Cicatricula, by enlarging, forms the Amnios, which contains the Colli- quamentum, or liquor in which the Chick is immersed at the earlier part of Incubation, but which is consumed by the end of it. Bv degrees. Umbilical Vessels are formed upon the Amnios,

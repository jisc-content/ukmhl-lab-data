Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 93 form, is placed at the inner corner of the Eye, and va- ries in size as circumstances may require. In many, it is only a partial covering. In the Lion and Cat tribe, Elephant, Seal, &c. it goes over the whole anterior part of the Eye. In Man and Apes, there is only a Rudi- ment of it. In the Cetacea, it is wanting. The Caruncuia Lacrymalis is observed in some, as the hooved Animals; but in others it appears to be wanting. The Lacrymal Gland exists in almost all the Animals of the class, and has nearly the same situation as in Man. In some, as the Ruminants, it is divided into Lobes. In the Hare and Rabbit, it is so large as to cover a great part .of the Eye. The Ducts of this Gland ai'e numerous, and, in larger Quadrupeds, can be readily seen passing through the upper Eye-lid. Besides the Lacrymal Gland, several Quadrupeds have an additional substance, termed Glandula Harderi. It exists in some of the Glires, in the Carnivora, Rumi- nants,i and Belluoe. In Ruminants, it is situated at the inner angle, and discharges a whitish humour, which passes by an orifice under the Palpebra Tertia. The Puncta Lacrymalia are in general the same as in Man. In the Hare, Rabbit, and some others, in place of Puncta, there is a slit under the Palpebra Tertia, opening into the Lacrymal Duct. In Sheep, the Puncta join into a long Nasal Duct, which terminates near the bottom of the Nose. Some of the Ruminunts, as the Deer and Antelope, are remarkable for the Larmiers, or Fossa; Lacrymales, which are small Cavities upon the Cheek under the Eye- lids,

OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 169 a second reservoir. In some Animals, as the Horse, which are destitute of a Gall-bladder, the dilatation of the Hepatic Duct, at its origin, is so large as to form a sort of reservoir for the Bile. In the Equas Quagga, however, an Animal lately introduced into this country from the Cape, though the Gall-bladder is wanting, there is no dilatation in the Hepatic Duct. The Ductus Com- munis, in the Cat tribe, after perforating the Muscular Coat of the Intestine, forms an Ampulla with two a- partmcnts, previous to its termination. In the Pig, the Ductus Communis is of great size, and terminates very near the Pylorus. In the Elephant, nine or ten Biliary Ducts unite into a Trunk, which forms an oval Sac in the substance of the Duodenum. This divides into Cells, one of which terminates in the Intestine by a small orifice. In the Dolphin and Porpoise, the Hepa- tic Duct terminates in the last of the Stomachs. Besides the Biliary Canals mentioned above, there are in some Animals, as the Hare, Dog, Ox, and Sheep, others, termed Hcpato-cystic, which terminate in the Body or Neck of the Gall-bladder, and thus convey the Bile directly into it from the Liver. Pancreas. The form, proportional size, 'and colour of the Pan- creas, vary a little in different Quadrupeds; but the structure of this Conglomerate Gland is the same as in Man. In most Mammalia, it is separated into Branch- es, which extend in different directions, its principal part being always placed transversely behind the Sto- mach, and between the Spleen and Duodenum. in

Paht IV.] OF FISHES. 307 In the Skate, the third Branch vanishes suddenly upon the Mucous Ducts which issue, as from a ceâ€™ntre, at the outer and back part of the Eye. The Sixth Pair is distri- buted as in other red-blooded Animals. Of the Seventh Pair, the Portio Dura is large in Cartilaginous Fishes, and comes off from the Brain quite distinct from the Au- ditory Nerve. J he Portio Mollis lies so near the Fifth Pair, as to appear to be a Branch of that Nerve. In Car- tilaginous Fishes, as the Skate, it passes into the Ear by a single Foramen; in the Osseous kind, as the Cod, where the Ear is in the same Cavity with the Brain, the Nerve is dispersed directly upon that Organ. The Eighth Pair is remarkable on account of its great size, and its distribution. It is divided into three portions, one of which runs directly to the Branchim. The se- cond goes to the Muscles of the Tongue, and to the E- sophagus. The third is a large Nerve, which extends under the Skin as far as the Tail Fin, upon which it terminates. The Ninth Pair appears to be wanting. T. he Great Sympathetic Nerve is also found here, but extremely slender. It unites with the Vertebral Nerves, but tins, like the other Nerves of Fishes, has no visible Ganglia, excepting those in the Olfactory Pair in certain Fishes, as the Gadus, See. ' l 1 he Spinal Marrow, in the Animals of this class, is re- markable for its great size when compared with the Brain, I he Cervical Nerves are few in number, and in some Animals there are none, the Vertebras of the Neck, in such Fishes, being wanting. When present, they are chiefly dispersed about the Throat and Pectoral Fin. U 2 f There

[Paut II. OF T11E BRAIN, &c. 216 Neuves, The Cerebral Nerves are the same in number as in Mammalia. The Olfactory, after leaving the Brain, goes in a distinct Canal to the Cavity of the Nose. The Second crosses its fellow, and goes to the Eye of the op- posite side. The Third, either by a hole peculiar to it, or by a Sphenoid Fissure, passes to the Muscles, as in Mammalia. The Fourth is also as in the former class. The Fifth divides as in Mammalia. The Branches to the Beak correspond with those about the Jaws in Mam- miferous Animals ; but those to the inner side of the Nose are of great magnitude, and run to the extremity of the Bill, in Birds which search for their food in water, mud, &c. The Sixth are as in Mammalia. Of the Seventh, the Portio Dura is proportionally small, the Lips being absent, and much of their Bill being Horny and Cal- lous, and not requiring a great supply of Nerves. The Portio Mollis, of great size, goes to the Labyrinth by many Branches. The Eighth and Ninth pairs are dis- persed as in Mammalia. The Great Sympathetic has origins, connexions, and terminations, which bear a considerable analogy to those of the Animals of the former class, varying only in some particulars. It passes through the same Foramen with the Pars Vaga and Glosso-pharyngeus. It unites with Nerves near it, has Ganglia in its course through the Body, and can be traced as far as the Vertebrae of the Tail. The Spinal Marrow is nearly of the same nature, and â€¢ * the

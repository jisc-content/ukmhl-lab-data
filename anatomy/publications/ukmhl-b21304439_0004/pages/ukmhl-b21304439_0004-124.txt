124 [Part I. OF THE MOUTH, &c. the are placed close to the Intermaxillary Bones, and differ more in the different Genera than either the Incisorcs or Molarcs. In many of the Ape kind, and more espe- cially in the larger Carnivorous Animals, as the Lion or Tiger, the Canine Teeth are of great size; and in some of the Swine tribe, as the Babiroussa, they ap- proach so near to a circle, as to render them ill adapted to the purposes to which they are applied at an early time of life. The Molares exist in every Animal possessing Teeth, the Narwal excepted, which has only the long Tusk. The situation and appearance of the Grinding Teeth vary considerably in this class of Animals. In the Ferae, the Bodies of these Teeth are entirely covered with Enamel; and the same thing takes place in the Animal called Mammoth, or Carnivorous Elephant; while the Grinders of Quadrupeds living chiefly on vegetables, and the Incisores of the Horse, have plates of Enamel extending into the Substance of the Tooth, and mixed in a tortuous manner with the Osseous part. These Animals have, besides, an additional substance in their Molar Teeth, differing in its nature from the two others, being like Tartar, and termed by Dr Blake, Crusta Petrosa, and by Cuvier, Cement. This may be readily seen cither in a longitudinal or transverse sec- tion of the Tooth of a Horse or Ox, but still better in the Tooth of an Elephant, where it forms a large pro- portion of the mass. It is then distinguished by the greater degree of yel- lowness and opacity of its colour, and is considered by

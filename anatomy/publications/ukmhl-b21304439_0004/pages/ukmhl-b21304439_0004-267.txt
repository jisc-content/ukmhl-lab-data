267 Part III.] OF REPTILES. of Animal, lurking in the earth, acquires the colour of the substance which surrounds it. Reptiles have likewise their Papilla: Nervosa?, but these are found chiefly in the Feet. The Glands of the Skin are more visible in this than in some of the preceding classes. In the Lizard, there is a range of Follicles under each Buttock, which dis- charge a viscid humour. In the Toad, Glands are ir- regularly dispersed over the Skin; and in the Salaman- der, along the Back, which throw out an acrid matter, especially when the Animals are irritated; yet these Reptiles are olten handled with impunity. The Pannicukis Carnosus exists in the Neck of the Turtle, and some appearance of it is observed in the Neck of the Frog ; but in the Body of the Animal, it is wanting. Ihe Clares on the Digits of the individuals of this class, are wanting wherever the Animal does not use its feet for seizing its prey, or for walking, as in the Tortoise, Frog, &c. * > â€¢ OF THE BRAIN. The Brain of Reptiles, consisting, as in the former classes of Animals, of Cerebrum and Cerebellum, is extremely small in proportion to the size of the Cra- nium.

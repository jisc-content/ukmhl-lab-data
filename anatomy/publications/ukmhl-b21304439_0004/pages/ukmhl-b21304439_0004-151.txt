In the Dos, the Rugae go length-ways between the Cardia and the Pylorus; the Esophagus opens so freely into the Stomach, as to enable the Animal to vomit readily. In the Bear, Lion, &c. the Stomach is divided by a slight contraction at its middle, into two portions. In the former, the Esophagus enters directly at the end of the Stomach. The Cat has a single Pyramidal Sto- mach. Among Amphibious Animals, as the Seal, some have a single Stomach, with the Esophagus entering directly at its extremity. In others again, as the T> i- checus, or Sea-coze, it is complicated, and is remarkable, according to Cuvier, for having a Gland as large as a personâ€™s head, in which a fluid, like that of the Pan- creas, flows into the Stomach by numerous pores. Some Herbivorous animals, as the Ilorsc, ha\e the Stomach simple, and uniform in its appearance exter- nally ; but the inner surface has the left portion covered with Cuticle, as in the Esophagus, and the right Vil- lous. The Muscular Coat has several Layers running in different directions. In Herbivorous Animals in general, the Esophagus terminates in such a manner in the Stomach, as to pic- vent the ready return of the Food; and this is consi- dered as one of the causes of these creatuies not having the power of vomiting, like the Carnivora, excepting in extraordinary cases; in Ruminants, however, which do not vomit, the passage into the Stomach is free. The inner part of the Stomach, in some other Animals, as the Hare, Rabbit, and several of the Mouse or Rat kind, has the left portion Cuticular, K I while

§61 ‘OF REPTILES. Part III.] ll 3 The last Vertebra of the Tail in the Rattle-snake sup- ports the Rattle. The Sternum is wanting, and, there being- no Limbs, the Bones of the Extremities of course are absent. OF THE MUSCLES. The two principal divisions of the Animals of this class, viz. those with, and those without Feet, have a remarkable difference in tire form and number of their Muscles. In the former, viz. the Turtle, Frog, &c where the Trunk of the Body possesses proportionally a small degree of mobility, a number of Muscles are wanting, though the others are strong. In the Animals of this class without Feet, namely, the Serpents, the Muscles are slender, but extremely numerous, on ac- count of the number of the Vertebra1, and the want of Anterior and Posterior Extremities. In the Turtle, the Spine possesses no motion but in the parts belonging to the Neck and Tail. The Back and Loins, being ossifieu together, have no Muscles. The Diaphragm, and also the Muscles of the Abdo- men, are wanting; but the other Muscles are remark- ably strong. The Neck possesses chiefly Muscles for elongation and retraction; the Neck being bent, when retracted into the Shell, somewhat like a Z, though it can be moved in various directions when it protrudes from the Shell, The Muscles for these motions are nu- merous.

Part II.] 201 OF BIRDS. Arches, they can shorten or lengthen the Neck readily. The Atlas has the shape of a ring, and is only connect- ed with the Head by a single articulation in the form of ball and socket. From the whole of this structure, such motion is allowed, that Birds have the peculiar power of placing the Bill under the Wing when they rest. The Dorsal Vertebrae have the Spinous Processes tied together by strong Ligaments, and they are often united into a solid mass. The Transverse Processes send off two points, one forwards, the other backwards, which join those of the other Vertebras, and the parts here are sometimes also anchylosed; but in Birds that cannot fly, as the Ostrich and Cassowary, the Vertebras remain moveable. The Lumbar Vertebrae are commonly ossified toge~ ther, and also to the Bones of the Sacrum and Pelvis, so as to give the appearance of a single Bone. The two lateral parts of the Pelvis do not close before, to form a Symphysis Pubis, excepting in the Ostrich. There is generally a Foramen Thyroideum, and the Ischiatic Notch is formed into a complete Foramen. The Caudal Vertebrae are found in greatest number in Birds which move their Tail most freely, as the Magpie and Swallow. The last Vertebra of the Tail is the largest, and is often in form of a plough-share, for the attachment of the Quills. In the Peacock, it is of an oval form, and situated horizontally. The Thorax, in Birds, is commonly remarkably large in proportion, "x he Ribs have several peculiari- ties in their form and attachments. Their \ ertebral Extremity

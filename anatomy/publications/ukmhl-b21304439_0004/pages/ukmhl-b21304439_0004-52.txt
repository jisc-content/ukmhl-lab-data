OF THE BONES [Part 1. In Carnivora, the Olecranon is extended farther back than in Man. In the Pig, Elephant, and some other Animals of similar shape, the Radius is placed entirely before the Ulna; they move on a single pulley. In Solipeds and Pecora, the Ulna is only an Appen- dix of the Radius. In the latter it is anchylosed with the Radius almost its whole length. In Solipeds, there is a Furrow, with a slit on the top. Hooved Animals have the Inferior Head of the Radius compressed, and the back of the Carpus turned forward. In the Ceta- cea, the Radius and Ulna have a flattened form. Hand.—The Carpus in Apes has one Bone more than in man. The Os Pisiformc is so prominent as to serve as a sort of Heel; and the same thing happens in the Carnivora. In the Mole, besides nine Bones, as in the Monkey, there is a Falciform Bone, which gives the shovel-like form to the Hand. In Carnivora, the Scaphoid and Lunar Bones are joined into one piece. Ruminants have four Bones in the first range. Most have two in the second. Solipeds have four in the first range, and three in the second. In Cetacea, the Bones of the Carpus are flattened, and joined together in the form of a pavement. Metacarpus.—The number ot the Tones heic is in general equal to that of the Fore Toes, except in Soli- peds and Ruminants, where, in the former, the Meta- carpal Bone consisted originally of two pieces, and, in the latter, the two Metacarpal Bones are at an early age united into one piece. In both these orders, this single piece is termed Canon or Shank Bone. In the Horse, the Canon Bone has a pair of much shorter

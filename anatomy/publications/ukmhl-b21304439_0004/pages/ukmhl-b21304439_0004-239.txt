1 \ Part IT.] OF BIRDS. 259 The Crop, in the Gallinaceous Birds, is of a globu- lar form, and placed at the fore part of the Chest. The Esophagus terminates at the upper or fore part of this Sac, and proceeds again from its opposite extremity, the Crop forming a sort of Cul-dc-Sac between these two orifices. Upon the inner side of the Crop are numerous Glands, with very distinct orifices, in larga Birds which throw out a liquor to assist in the solution of the Food. In many, the Glands are in irregular rows. In the Pigeon, &c. which nourish the young from the Crop, the Glands swell remarkably at that time. The Pigeon has a spherical Bag on each side of the Esophagus, and these, in the Poulting Pigeon, are fill- ed with air, so as to give the appearance constantly ob- served. 'lhe Crop is peculiar to Granivorous Birds, but i6 wanting in the Ostrich. To the Crop succeeds another Cavity, in the shape of a Funnel, called Ventriculus Succenturiatus, Infundi- bulum, or Second Stomach. This is situated in the Ab- domen, and is commonly smaller than the former. It is more general among Birds than the Crop, and va- ries much in size in the different Species. It has a covering from the Peritoneum, and is generally thicker than the Esophagus, owing to its numerous Glands, from which a fluid is discharged. In the Ostrich, this Stomach, from its size and form, has the appearance of a Crop. The Mucous Glands here are about the size of Garden-Peas, and have ori- fices uncommonly distinct. It dilates into a Bao- ca- Â© pable

The Clives have the Thumb short, but otherwise perfect. In the Ferae, the Toe, resembling the Human Thumb, is on the same plane with the other Moes ; of course they have not the power of grasping any thing.

In Ruminants, the single Metacarpal Bone supports the two Toes which form the part termed Cloven Foot. Several species have besides two little Bones, frequently covered with Nails, Avhich represent two other Toes; but these are so short as not to touch the ground.

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 57 Solipeds have only two Cuneiform Bones in the Tar- sus. In Ruminants, the Scaphoid and Cuboid Bones are united together, except in the Camel, which has them distinct. The Tarsus of the three-toed Sloth has only four Bones, viz. the Os Calcis, the Astragalus, and two Cu- neiform Bones. The Astragalus is articulated with the Fibula, with the Os Calcis, and the Great Cuneiform Bone, in such a manner, that the Foot possesses only lateral motion, but which is perfectly adapted to the re- quisite purposes of embracing and climbing the Trunks and Branches of Trees. Metatarsus.—The structure of the Metatarsus is in ge- neral the same with that of the Metacarpus. The Ape tribe have the Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe only about half the length of the others, but it can be readi- ly separated to some distance from them. Solipeds and Ruminants have a single Metatarsal or Canon Bone of the Hind Leg, which, in the former Genus, and some- times in the latter, has a small Styloid Bone on each side. Toes.—In Apes, the smaller Toes are longer than in Man. The Phalanges are much of the same nature with the corresponding parts of the Anterior Extre- mities. The Great Toe is shorter than the rest, but the Me- tatarsal Bone can move like the Thumb, in opposing the other Toes when the Animal is climbing trees, &c. The same thing takes place in the Genus Opossum, but this structure is only in the Posterior Extremity. In Carnivora in general, the Great Toe is united with, and

Round the Mouth are Sacs, which open into it, and are supposed to dis- charge a kind of Saliva. The Monadcs, and other Microscopical Animals, ap- pear to be extremely simple, having neither any appa- rent Mouth nor Stomach. They seem to be Gelatinous masses, nourishing themselves by imbibing from their surface. Nervous System.—No distinct Nervous System has yet befen found in this class of Animals.

There is a soft white circle, from which Filaments run to each of the Branches of the Animal, and also to the Stomach. Something of a similar nature is seen in the Holotliuria. Between the different pairs of longitudinal Muscles, a white cord appears, marked with the zig-zag • lines seen in the Nerves of other Animals, and seeming also to encircle the Esophagus. No appearance of Nerves has been detected either in the Medusa or the Actinia. In the Hydra, or Polypus ioilh Arfhs, and also in Animals the productions of infusion, there is nothing like Nerves, yet they are sensible of heat.

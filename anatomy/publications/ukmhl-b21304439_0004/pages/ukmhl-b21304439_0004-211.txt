211 Part II.] OF BIRDS. Feet, is generally formed of Horny Scales, which fall off in moulting-time. The Corpus Mucosum is not very distinct. It vanesâ€™ in colour in different parts of the Body. In the Legs and Feet, almost all the different colours are to be ob- served in the different individuals of the class. 1 he Cutis is much thinner than in Quadrupeds, but has considerable thickness in Birds of prey. The Pa- pillae Nervosae, and sense of feeling in the Integuments of Birds, reside only in the Feet and Toes, the Supe- rior Extremities being generally covered with Feathers. Even in the Lower Extremities of some, the Legs and Toes are frequently covered with Scales or Feathers, so as to blunt the sense of Feeling also in this part of the Animal. The Cellular Substance immediately under the Skin, adheres loosely to the parts directly above and below it, but particularly at the Axillae. In certain Birds, as the Swallow, the Subcutaneous Cellular Substance is deprived of Fat, though the Pe- ritoneum is charged with it in the winter-season. F rom the surface of the Skin, Excretions take place, as in the former class of Animals, as appears in moult- ing, and from a quantity of mealy dust being separated in pairing-time. Besides the Layers of the Skin mentioned above, Birds have a Panniculus Carnosus, which is more dis- tinct in certain kinds, as those which raise their Fea- thers in particular parts of the Body. Besides one broad Muscle, there are Slips which run in different O ^ directions.

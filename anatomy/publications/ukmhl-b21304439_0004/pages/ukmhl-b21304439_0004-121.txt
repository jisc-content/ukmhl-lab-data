Esophagus.â€”In all the class, the Esophagus is nearly cylindrical, and is continued from the Pharynx to the Stomach. It is long in all, except in the Cetacea. It is narrow in most, but wide in Animals which swallow * voraciously. In the generality of Quadrupeds, the Esophagus is distinguished from that in Man, by two rows of Mus- cular Fibres decussating each other, and running in a spiral but opposite direction. On this, Rumination is commonly explained, though the same structure exists in different Carnivorous Animals which do not rumi- nate, as the Dog, Cat, Bear, &c. ; but in ruminating Animals, the Coats of the Esophagus are remarkably strong. Many Plica; are formed upon the inner surface of the Esophagus, which, as in Man, are most evident when it is most contracted. There are also many Fol- licles here, from which a Humour is plentifully sup- plied. Of the Teeth. All Mammiferous Animals have Teeth in their Jaws, with a few exceptions, as the American Ant- eaters, Scaly Lizards, and the proper Whales. Be- sides the Teeth proper for mastication, some, as the Dog, Lion, Tiger, &c. have Canine Teeth, serving partly as offensive weapons, and partly to enable the Animal to lay hold of and lacerate its prey. Others, as the Elephant, Hippopotamus, and Walrus, have Tusks, /

262 [Part III. OF THE MUSCLES merous. Some pass from the under and fore part of the Back Shell to the Vertebrae of the Neck, and others from one set of Vertebrae to another. One Muscle is peculiar to this Animal, which arises from the first Dorsal Vertebra, and is fixed to the sixth and seventh Cervical Vertebrae. It begins the extension of the Neck, when the Head is concealed in the Shell. About half a dozen pairs of Muscles lie on the back part of the Neck, chiefly for raising the Head, 01 pull- ing it laterally. A few Muscles also appear below, par- ticularly one supplying the place of the Stei no-mastoi- deus, for bending the Head, and producing a slight donation of the Shoulder. •The Muscles of the Shoulder arc only three in num- ber, and are analogous to the Trapezius, Levator Sca- pxdfe, and Subclavius. rlhe Muscles ol the Humerus are more numerous- than in other Animals, to give the necessary motions in swimming. They arise from the Bones of the Shoulder, and from the inner side of the Dorsal and Abdominal Shells. The Tectoralis Major is composed of several portions. There are something like two Deltoids. I he other Muscles are analogous to the Latissimus Dorsi, Levator Brachii, Teres Major, and Biceps. The Muscles of the Fore-arm, and remaining part of the Anterior Extremity, are in a great measure A- poneurotic, the Member being in the form of a Fin, as in the Cetacea. '\ his is particularly the case in the Sea Tortoise, where the Muscles are Aponeurotic Bands, which strengthen the Articulations. Muscles of the Posterior Extremity.—There is a Muscle, 4

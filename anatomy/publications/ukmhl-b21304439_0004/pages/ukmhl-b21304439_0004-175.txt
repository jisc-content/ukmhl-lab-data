OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 175 part of the Kidney,- and varies in proportional size almost in every Species; but it appears to change with age much less than in Man. Its use here, as in the Human Body, has not been discovered, though it is considered as subservient to the Kidney. Among the Glires, it is proportionally large, being from a 12th to a 4th jxai't of the bulk, of the Kidney ; -while, in the Force, it is in general not more than a 20th or a 50th part. The form, also, of this substance is very various. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is often round, or cylindri- cal, or conical. In many Animals, its external appear- ance is very similar to that of the Kidney. In the Ce- tacea, it is divided into numerous Lobules, which have generally two distinct substances, the outer yellowish, the inner deep brown, and softer than the outer. The external is often more than half the thickness of the Gland ; but the colour and distinction of substance vary much in different Animals. In some, as the Ele- phant, this is scarcely observed; in others, as in some of the Glires, three or more substances of different co- lours have been found. Bladder. All Mammalia have a Bladder of Urine, but it is more loose than in Man, and is completely covered by the Peritoneum. The shape is also different; the bot- tom, or Fundus, on account of the horizontal situa- tion of the Animal, being most dependent, becomes the widest part. In Herbivorous Animals, particularly in

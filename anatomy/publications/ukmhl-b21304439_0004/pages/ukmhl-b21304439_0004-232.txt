ORGANS OF VOICE, Sic. [Part II. SS2 The, OF THE ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRA TION The Organs of \ oice and Respiration in Birds diffei extremely from those of other Animals. The Larynx is peculiar in being double, or in there being one at each end ol the 1 rachea. The Superior Larynx is situated at the root of the Tongue and top of the Trachea, and is composed of several osseous Pieces, the largest of which is analogous to the Cricoid Cartilage. There are neither Thyroid nor Arytenoid Cartilages, nor Epiglottis, in Biids. The Kim a Glottidis is a simple Chink or Slit, with Muscular sides, which can merely open and close the passage, having no connection with the formation of Voice. In place of the Epiglottis, there are, in many Birds, Cartilaginous Papillae upon the edge of the Glottis, to prevent the Aliment from going into the Lungs. In the Ostrich, there is a slight elevation, which some have considered as an Epiglottis. The Trachea is composed of Cartilages or of Bone, which form complete rings, and these overlap each other at their edges in such a manner, that the diame- ter of the Tube is not affected by any twisting of the Neck. Its form is commonly cylindrical, sometimes co- nical, at other times it has dilatations and contractions, as in some of the Swimming' Knds.

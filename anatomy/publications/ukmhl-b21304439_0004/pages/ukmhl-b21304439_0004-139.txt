OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 139 seen to greater advantage than in the Human Body. In the Sheep, Goat, be. the Lacteals run in Trunks of considerable size, and are readily detected in the Car- nivora, as the Dog', by feeding the Animal with Milk, or other nourishing substances, and a few hours after- wards laying open the Abdomen. 'J'ljg Absorbent, or Conglobate Glands, are fewer m number, in this class of Animals, but larger, and more collected together, than in the Human Species. The Glands of the Mesentery, in many of the Mammalia, particularly in Carnivora, are united into a mass, term- ed Pancreas Aselii, in consequence of the Discoverer mistaking them for that Organ. In a few Animals, they form two groups, or in some one group, and an accessory one. In Ruminants, they are dispersed over the Mesentery, corresponding seem- ingly with the great size and length of the Intestines in Herbivorous Animals. The connexion between the Absorbents and their Glands is observed to be less general in Quadrupeds than in Man, there being few instances where Branches reach the Thoracic Duct in the Human Body, without previously entering one or more of them ; whereas, in Quadrupeds, it appears that many Absorbents go di- rectly to the Common Trunk, without the intervention of Glands. The internal structure of the Absorbent Glands has been observed in some of the larger Animals of the class, and in a few, as Solipeds and Cetacea, they have been found to have more of a Cellular than \ ascular ap- pearance ;

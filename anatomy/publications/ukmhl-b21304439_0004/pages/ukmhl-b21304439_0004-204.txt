204 OF THE RONES [Part II. The Bones in the Wings of the Penguins are remark- able for their flattened appearance, and form a sort of medium between the Wing of the Bird and the Fin of the Fish. In the Lower Extremities, there is an Os Femoris, a Tibia, and a Fibula, which is soon anchylosed to the Tibia, and does not reach its Lower Extremity; a liotula, the place of which is often supplied by a Process of the Tibia, as in Diving Birds; one Bone supplying the place of Tarsus and Metatarsus; and the ioes, the Bones of which are more numerous, the more exterior- ly they are placed. The Toes are articulated upon a Pulley, formed by the lower end of the Metatarsal Bone. The inner side has a small Bone, that supports the Pos- terior Toe or Pollex. There are two Bones to the Pollex, three to the Second 1 oe, four to the lhird loe, and five to the Fourth. In Birds with only three Toes, the First Toe has three, the Second four, and the Third 'I'oe five Bones. The Cassowary has only three Toes, and the Ostrich two. The Birds with four Toes have commonly three before, and one behind. Some, as the Parrot, Cuckoo, Sec. have two before and two behind. Swimming Birds, as the Penguin, have the Pollex obliterated. In wading and other long-limbed Birds, the length of the Leg is produced by the Tibia, and the Bone which supplies the place of '1 arsus and Metatarsus; and is often in proportion to that of the Neck, though there ave many exceptions. rI he Lower Extremities of Birds in general, are placed so much behind the common centre of gravity, as to make the Animal ap- pear

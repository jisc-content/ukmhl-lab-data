36 OF THE RONES [Part I. The Cetacea and Seal have no cavities even in their long Bones. The Horns of some Animals, as the Stag, are of the same nature with the Bones, but internally have neither Cavities nor Marrow. The component parts of the Bones of all Mammalia correspond in a great measure with those of the Human Body ; but their relative proportions are found to differ, not only in the various Genera and Species, but in the different Bones of the same individual. The Horn of the Stag is similar to Bone, not only in its texture, but also in its component parts, in which there is a large proportion of Gelatine. OF THE SKELETON. The Skeleton of Mammalia is divided into Head, Trunk, and Extremities ; the last of which, in Quadru- peds, owing to the horizontal situation of the Animal, are denominated Anterior and Posterior, the former corresponding to the Superior, the latter to the Inferior Extremities of the Human Body.

Part III.] 263 OF REPTILES. Muscle, analogous to the Quadratus Lumborum, lying under the Dorsal Shell, and moving the Os Ilium ; and another, supplying the place of a Rectus Abdominis, arising from the posterior extremity of the Abdominal Shell, and fixed to the Pubes. Of the Muscles of the Thigh, there are different Adductors. A Muscle from the Pubes is fixed to the small Trochanter, and holds the place of the Iliacus and 'Psoas. One Muscle arises from the Spine, and two from the Pubes, which corre- spond to the Glutei. A Muscle analogous to the Ob- turator Internus arises from the Ilium, and is fixed to the great Trochanter. The Muscles of the Leg are analogous to the Semi-membranosus, Semi-tendinosus, and Sartorius. There is an Extensor, a Rectus, and two Bieipites. One remarkably thin Muscle arises from the Coccyx, and passes under the Skin of the Extre- mity to its insertion, nearly opposite the Ileel. It bends the Leg, and extends the Foot. In the Sea Tortoise, the Muscles of the Foot, and also of die 'Foes, are chiefly Aponeurotic. In the Frog, few Muscles belong to the Spine. A Muscle analogous to the Coccygeus draws the Coccyx into the same direction with the Spine. There is a sort of Sapro-lumbalis, which is fixed to the Transverse Processes of the Vertebra?, and extends as far as the Head ; an Obliquus Superior, a Rectus Anterior, and I ntertransversales. 1 he Abdominal Muscles, on account of the want of Ribs, are inserted into the Sternum. There are few Muscles belonging to the Head ; most of those inserted R 4 intp

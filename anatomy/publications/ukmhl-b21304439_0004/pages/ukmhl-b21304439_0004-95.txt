95 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. oblong. In the Cut kind, it foi'ms an oval, placed in a vertical direction, and, in a strong light, is contracted almost to a line. The size of the Pupil is in propor- tion to the quantity of light wanted. Night-watching Animals, as the Cat tribe, have it contracted through the day, and dilated through the night, to receive a sufficient quantity of light. In the Foetus, at an early period of Gestation, the Pupil is covered with a Mem- brana Pupillaris, as in the Human Species. The Sclerotis, in most of the Mammalia, corresponds in texture with that in Man, and, as in the Human Eye, is thinner at the anterior than posterior part. In the Seal it is thick and firm, except at its middle, where it is so thin and flexible, as to influence what are termed the Internal Changes of the Eye. In a Whale of or- dinary size, where the Eye is only equal to the bulk of an Orange, the Sclerotis is fully an inch thick at its back part, but thinner and more yielding anteriorly, which may in some measure answer the same purpose with the flexibility in the middle of the Sclerotica of the Seal. The Cornea, in the Whale, is received into a Groove of the Sclerotic; but in the other animals of this class, there is considerable variety in the attachment of these Coats; though in all, it appears they can be separated from each other by maceration. The Choroid Coat and Ciliary Processes exist in all the Animals of the class; and both of these parts, as well as the back of the Iris, are generally lined with a Pigment, which, in the Ape kind, is brown or black, as in Man. I he Ciliary Processes, and their Vascu- larity, are very conspicuous in some of the larger Ani- mals

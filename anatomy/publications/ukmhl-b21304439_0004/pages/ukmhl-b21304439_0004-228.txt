OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Part II. 22S The Tongue of the Wood-pecker is a sharp Horny substance with barbed edges, and fixed at its root to a Cartilaginous Os Hyoides, consisting of a Body and two pairs of very long Crura. The Body, when in a state of rest, is placed in a fleshy sheath of the Bill. Two of the Crura lie in the Neck, the other two are connected to the former, then proceed completely over the Cranium, running under the Integuments, and are fixed to the Upper Jaw. By means of this apparatus acting like a spring, the Tongue can be thrust some inches out of the Mouth. The Salivary Glands, in Birds, exist only un- der the Tongue, where they occupy the place of the Sublingual in Mammalia. They form a mass of small Granulous Bodies, from which a liquor, somewhat Vis- cid, flows into the Mouth by numerous orifices. In the Gallindcea, they are of considerable size. Two pairs are found in the Turkey, the first lying con- cealed immediately under the Skin, the second on the posterior portion of the first. Their colour is yellowish, like the humour which they secrete. In the Parro^rf, the liquor of these Glands is viscid and grey. In the Wood- pecker, the Salivary Gland extends as far as the Occi- put, is of a white colour, and sends out a single Duct, which terminates under the point of the Tongue, dis- charging a white Fluid into the Mouth. Water Birds in general have but one pair of Glands, which secrete a white and viscid humour, discharged by many orifices; but in some of the Birds of this order, as the Cull, the Salivary Glands have only a single Duct. ~

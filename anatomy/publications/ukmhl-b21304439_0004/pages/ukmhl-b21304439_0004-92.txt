[Part I. OF TIIE EVE <)2 f OF THE EYE. All Mammalia have two Eyes. They are largest in proportion in small Animals, excepting in such as live much under ground, as the Mole and Shrew, in which -they are quite diminutive. In the Ape kind, their direction is forward as in Man, but they are closer together. In other Quadrupeds, they arc placed laterally, and proportionally more dis- tant from each other. In Man, and in the Ape tribe, the axis and diameter are nearly equal to each other. In the greater number of Quadrupeds, the axis is rather less than the dia- meter. In the Cetacea, it is found to be nearly as two to three. Eye-lids are common to all the Animals of the class, but the under one, in most Quadrupeds, wants Cilia. In most of the Ape tribe, in the Elephant, See. they are present in both Eye-lids. The Sebaceous Follicles are very distinct in the larger Mammalia, as the Ox, See.

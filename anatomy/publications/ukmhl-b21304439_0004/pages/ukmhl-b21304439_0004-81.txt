$1 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] In such Animals as frequently dive or swim, the Toes are inclosed in Membranes. In the'Cetacea, they are concealed under the Skin, and form the Fins. All Ruminants, and many of the Belluce, have two Toes inclosed in triangular Hooves, forming a mould on which they walk. Solipeds have but one Toe, the last Bone of which is inclosed in a semicircular Hoof, which supports them in walking. This is com- posed of a horny covering, similar in its structure and formation to the Hooves of Ruminants; but it. incloses the whole Bone. The internal surface is formed into numerous Lamina?, which have intermediate Layers of Vascular matter for their nourishment. In the inferior- part of the Hoof, there is a soft matter full of Nerves, and very sensible when punctured. Besides the parts mentioned above, there are others connected with the Common Integuments, destined for the secretions of peculiar fluids. These occur in cer- tain Genera and Species belonging to particular classes of Animals. In the Temple of the Elephant is a Gland, from which a duct runs downwards and forwards, and ter- minates half way between the Eye and the Ear ; through this, in both sexes, but more especially in the Male, a brownish liquor is discharged upon the Skin at rutting- time. In the Deer, Antelope, and Hare, are Membranous Sacs, with Follicles opening into them, placed in a Sub- orbitar Fossa of the superior Maxillary Bone. From these a Viscid, Adipose, dark Fluid is discharged through Vol. IV. F a

[Paiit II. OF THE EYE Â£13 I and are placed so much in a lateral direction, that the .Animal, in viewing objects particularly, turns towards them one side of the Head, and examines them with a single Eye. The Orbits are more shallow here than in Quadru- peds, of course, the cushion of Fat surrounding the back part of the Eye is thinner. In most Birds, as Fowl, Duck, Turkey, &c. the Eye- lids are closed by the Orbicularis elevating the Inferior Palpebra, which is the largest, and has a small Lamina of Cartilage. There is a peculiar Muscle arising from the bottom of the Orbit, for depressing this Eye-lid. In a few, as the Parrot, Owl, .Goatsucker, Ostrich, kc. the Upper Eye-lids are most moveable. Cilia are found in a few Birds only, as some Parrots and Ilawks, the Ostrich, kc. Besides the two ordinary or horizontal Eye-lids, Birds have a third one [laced at the Nasal Angle, and termed Mcmbrana Nictitans, which is a semi-transpa- rent Membrane, capable of covering the whole Eye. In a state of rest, it is scarcely observed, but can be drawn out by the action of two Muscles, so as to cover the whole front of the Globe. 1 he Muscles performing this motion, arise from the back of the Sclerotic. Ihe one, termed Quadratus, has its origin from above ; the other, called Pyramidalis, comes from below, and forms a Tendinous Cord, that runs through an Aponeurotic Sheath formed by the first, then in Cellular Substance? at the under part of the Sclerotica, to be fixed to the inferior and exterior edge of the Mcmbrana Nictitans.

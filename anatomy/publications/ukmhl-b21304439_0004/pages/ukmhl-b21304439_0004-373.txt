Part VIII. OF WORMS. 373 above, and two below their Body, which they move ac- cording to the direction or situation of the Fibres. These form the principal part of the Body of the Ani- mal. Another set of Muscles are appropriated to the Hairs, Bristles, &c. and consist of short Fibres, some of which are for pushing them outwards, others for drawing them inwards. By these Muscles, and the Spines, &c. on which they act, the Animal is enabled to perform its locomotion. One set of Worms want these Spines or Bristles, of course move in a different manner from the former. Their progression is accomplished by applying the two extremities of their Body alternately to the surface of the parts on which they move. These consist of Leeches, which have the extremities of their Bodies formed into contractile fleshy Disks or Suckers; or sopie have Anterior Extremities provided with Hooks ; the outer parts of their Body being a fleshy Sac, com- posed of longitudinal and circular Fibres. By fixing- one end, and contracting tbe circular Fibres, the Body can be so elongated, as to allow the other extremity to reach the place intended. The Animal now fixes this extremity, and, by contracting the longitudinal Fibres, draws the other end forwards. Nervous System.â€”No Nerves have been discovered in several of the internal Worms, but in the external Worms the Nervous System has.been considered as ana- logous to that of Crustacea and Insects. A Cord generally runs through the whole length of the Animal, and has Ganglia reg ularly dispersed, from which numerousNerves proceed to the different parts of the Body. In the Aphro- dita Aculenta, the Nervous System is similar to that of A a 3 the

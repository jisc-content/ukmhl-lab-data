I OF Part II.] OF BIRDS. 237 possessing little mobility on account of their attachment above to the Thorax, which has little motion where they are fixed to it. The rest of the Thorax, however, admits of considerable dilatation, so as to determine the air to the Cells ; and the double articulation of the Ribs likewise favours this. Inspiration, in Birds, is owing to'a dilatation of the Air-Cells from Muscles acting upon the Thorax ; or upon the Lungs, as is observed in such large Birds as the Ostrich and Cassowary. Expiration is produced by a relaxation of the Muscles employed in Inspiration ; by the action of Muscles si- tuated over the Air-Cells; and more particularly about the Abdomen, bringing the posterior part of the Ster- num nearer the Vertebrae; and, according to some Authors, by the power of the Lungs themselves, as is observed in the larger Birds. The strength of the Voice is in proportion to that of the Aerial Cavities. This facility of modulating it, de- pends upon the mobility of the Muscles which contract the Lungs. The difference of voice in different Birds depends upon the proportional length, form, consistence, and mobility of the Rings of the Trachea. The cause of the loss of voice in some Birds, as the Quail, Cuckoo, &c. at certain seasons, is not understood.

251 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Pailt IT. Amnio?, Yolk, and Membranes of the Albumen, in which last substance the greater part of the Branches are expanded. The lining of the Shell is now cover- ed with Blood-vessels, expanded upon a Membrane which forms, the Chorion. Near the end of Incubation, the Umbilical Vessels begin to shrivel, and, at the.ex- clusion of the Chick, are quite diminutive. Production of the Chick.â€”At the end of the first day, a small white spot, the Nidus Pulli, sen Colliquamentum, is discerned near the Cicatricula. On the second day, the Chick is ooserved in the form of a Gelatinous Filament, and the Cicatricula soon afterwards vanishes. At the end of the second day, Blood-vessels appear upon the sur- face of the Yolk, and these soon become connected to the Chick. The Vascular part is termed Figura Vcno- sa, or Area Vasculosa. The Arteries arise from the Mesenteric ; the principal Vein goes to the Porta. Be- sides the Blood-vessels, a Canal is formed in the course of Incubation, which joins the Membrane of the Yolk to the Intestinum Ilium of the Chick, under the name of Ductus Vvtello-%nicstinalis. Third day, the Punctum Sadicns, or Heart, appears, and is distinguished by its motion. The Spine is seen in a curved state, with pro- minences, which are the Brain and Eyes, the lattci of which are remarkable for their great proportional size. Fourth day, the Abdominal Viscera appear, after which the Extremities sprout out. A \ ascular Mcmbiune, the Chorion, or Membrana Umbilicalis, begins to form about the Navel, which, increasing by degrees, lines almost the whole inner surface of the Membrana Albu- minis during the latter half of the period of Incuba- tion.

It is somewhat cylindrical in the Ape kind and Glires, slender in the Boar and Ruminants, cylindrical in the Horse and Ele- phant, large and conical in the Porpoise, and large, co- nical, and flat in the Dolphin. The Crura Penis, in Mammalia, are proportionally short. They adhere to the Bones as intimately as in Man. In the Dog and some Apes, there are two Corpora Cavernosa, with a Septum Penis; in others of this last tribe, the Septum is wanting or incomplete. It is ab- sent in Solipeds, Ruminants, and Cetacea, and in most Bclluoe ; in which case, there is only a single Corpus Ca- vernosum. In the Elephant, there is a complete Septum. The Ornithorrjnchus and Kangaroo are remarkable for having four Crura Penis, and the Urethra in the axis of the Corpora Cavernosa, which form a cylindrical ring, with a Septum both above and below it. In several Mammalia, there is a Bone in the Penis, for conducting it into the Vagina. This is found more frequently in such Animals as have no Vesiculae Semi- nales; in these the copulation being tedious, they turn averse from each other during the emission of the Se- men. But it is found also in some where these Bodies are present. It exists in most of the Ape tribe, though here it is small; in Bats, and in several Rats; in the Badger, Bear, Weasel, Dog and Cat kind ; in the Seal, and in the Balena among the Cetacea. It is wanting in the Opossum, Hyena, Solipeds, Ruminants, and Bel- luce. When present, it makes part of the walls of the Penis,

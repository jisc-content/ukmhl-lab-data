OF THE LIVER, &c. [Part I. 168 The Biliary Ducts, in the Ape kind, are furnished with Cells in the Cystic Duct, the same as in Man. In other Mammalia, they have a smooth appearance; the Kangaroo Giant, however, has numerous Glands and Cells in the Hepatic Duct. They vary much, in Mammalia, in their number, manner of uniting, and in their termination. When a Gall-bladder is present, the Hepatic Ducts commonly unite into one Trunk, which communicates with the Cystic ; in other cases, they join it in succession. The Ducts terminate in the Duodenum, after piercing the Gut obliquely, much after the same manner as in the Human Body. The distance of the termination varies jn different Animals. L9 the Glires, it is found tu be the least; and in the Kangaroo Giant, among the Force, it is the greatest, though some Authors have supposed, that the Biliary Ducts terminated nearest the Pylorus in voracious Animals. In the Ornithorrynch'us, two Branches of the Hepatic Duct unite with the Cystic near the Neck of the Gall- Bladder. In some of the Bat kind, in Rats, and in the Porcupine and Hedge-hog, many Hepatic Ducts join the Cystic near each other, or in succession. The Mole has two Hepatic Ducts, one of which receives the Cystic, then unites with the other to form the common Duct. In the Seal, one Branch of the Hepatic Duct joins the Cystic near the Neck of the Gall-bladder; the second unites with the Cystic near the insertion in the Intes- tine, and the Cystic Duct appears to form the common one. The Martin kind have the common Duct dilated into a

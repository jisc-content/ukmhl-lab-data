18 OF THE BONES [Part I. The Ferae have the Abdominal Surface of the Ossa Ilia turned towards the Spine. They are nearly as broad behind as before, and are hollow externally. In the Mole, the Ossa Innominata are almost cylindrical, and so close together, that the Parts of Generation are situated on the Abdominal side of the Brim of the Pel- vis. The Bear, which rests much on its Buttocks, lias the Pelvis more similar to that in man, than in many others. In the Otter and Seal, it is similar to that of other Carnivora. In the Solipeds, the Ossa Ilia are large, and the Ossa Ischia short. The Acetabula, as in many other Quadrupeds, correspond with the posterior third part of the length of the Ossa Innominata. The Symphysis Pubis is remarkable for its length; and, in old Animals, is frequently Anchylosed. In the larger Ruminants, as the Ox, the Ilia are of great breadth. In the more diminutive species, they are proportionally smaller. The external surface is con- cave. Among the Belluce, the Pelvis of the Fig is similar to that of the Ferae, but the Ossa Ischia go farther back, and the Notches of the Ilia extend farther into the Bones. The Elephant and Rhinoceros ha\ e bi oad Ossa Ilia; the Abdominal Surface is concave, the Pel- vis is of enormous size, and the Symphysis Pubis of great length. The Cetacea have no Pelvis, except two thm flat Bones, suspended in the flesh of the back pai t of the Belly, and side of the Anus, and somewhat analogous to the Ossa Pubis. . The

[Part VII. 364 OF INSECTS. The the Body, forming, in its course, ten or twelve Gan- glia, from which, and from the Brain, Nerves go off to the different parts of the Animal. In perfect Insects, the Brain has generally two Lobes, and is also situated above the Esophagus.- The Nerves and Ganglia, in some Insects, are similar in number, general appearance, and distribution, to those of Larvae; in others, they vary considerably in all these respects. Eye. There are two kinds of Eyes in this tribe of Animals, some small and simple, and termed Stemmata, varying from two to eight in number, others arc large, appearing like a collection of smaller Lyes, but are only two in number. These are divided, in some Insects, into many hundred hexagonal convex surfaces, which appear like so many different Cornea? or Lenses. The simple Eyes are found in most of the Aptera, and in the Larvae of many winged Insects, but are too small for examination. When the Larva? change into complete Insects, they change also their simple for compound Eyes. Several Genera of winged Insects and Aptera, are observed to have simple besides compound Eyes; many Insects, on the other hand, have no Eyes. The Eyes of Insects have no Eye-lids, are commonly im- moveable, and, according to Swammerdam, do not con- tain the same Humours which are found in the higher classes of Animals. The appearances of the Eyes of Insects are so diffe- rent from those in other classes, that experience alone shews them to be Eyes. When they arc covered or cut out, the Animal can no longer find its way.

In the Turtle, the} terminate in the beginning of the Urethra, from whence the Urine goes into the Bladder. In many of the Li- zard tribe, the Ureters terminate in a Bladder, which is of considerable extent, and the Urethra opens into a Cloaca. In the Crocodile, the Ureters end in a Cloaca, there being no Bladder. In Serpents, each Ureter di- lates into a Vesicle, which terminates in a Cloaca. In general, they end in a Bladder or a Cloaca, as the Oi- gan happens to exist. The Bladder, when present, re- ceives the Urine at its Neck, or at the beginning of the Urethra, and opens directly into the Cloaca. In the Genus liana, viz. the Frog and Toad, there are two Bags, taken notice of by Blumenbach and Cu- vier, as Urinary Bladders. Townson, however, describes the Ureters in these \nimals as terminating at the posterior part ol the Rec- tum, as in Birds, while the Receptacles here mentioned, and which are of great size,. terminate at its anterior part; and is of opinion, that the fluid they contain is pure water, which he has frequently tasted. He thinks this fluid is absorbed from the surface of the Skin, anc serves the same purpose to these Animals, as fluids do to those which take them into the Stomach by the Mouth ; that the fluid they eject prevents an inconve- nience in leaping. , n In the Turtle tribe, the bottom of the Bladder di- vides into two Cornua.

On the upper side of the Valves are two Membranous Sacs, lined with a black Mucous Skin, which is the continuation of the Common Integuments, and covered externally by a strong Muscular Expansion that arises from the Cranium. They have a common opening ex- ternally, by a narrow chink in form of a crescent. The water taken in by the Mouth, and which, in Fishes, is thrown out at the openings of the Gills, is here pre- vented from being swallowed, by the contraction of the Pharynx. This elevates the Valves, and distends the Sacs, from which the fluid is forcibly discharged to a great height by the surrounding Muscular Fibres. Vol IV. OF ' / \

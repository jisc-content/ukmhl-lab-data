366 OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part III. Lizards, both of the water and land kind, frequently change their Skin, which is pulled off chiefly by the assistance of the Feet.

In those with naked Skins, as the Frog and Salamander, it is moist, being covered with a viscid fluid. In Serpents, there is a strong Skin under the Scales, intimately connected with the Muscles. The Cellular Substance, more or less loose in Rep- tiles, connects the Skin to the parts underneath. In the Frog and Toad, the Integuments arc remark- able in adhering to the Body at certain points only, and there, chiefly by Vessels and Nerves, viz. about the Mouth, Linea Mediana of the Body, Arm-pits, and Groins. In other parts, the Animal lies loose in the Skin, as in a Bag. Between the Epidermis and Skin, and under t ic Scales, the Corpus Mucosum is situated, which vanes in colour, having all the different tints in the different in- dividuals of the class. In the Camcleon, some Frogs, &c. the colour changes occasionally, in consequence of light, heat, effects of pas- sion, fee. * In a Toad kept constantly in the light the colour changes to a pale green ; while the same kind P1

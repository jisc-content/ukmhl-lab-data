I Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 181 ferentia, or separately. They are like the \esiculae Se- minales in structure, and increase like them at rutting- time. They are observed also to be filled, apparently with the same kind of liquor. They exist in most of the Glires, as the Rat, and in the Hedge-hog■ and Mole among the Carnivora, but ap- pear to be wanting in the other Mammalia, the Horse excepted, in which there is a cylindrical Vesicle placed between the Vasa Deferentia, and terminating in the Urethra, before the openings of the Vesicular Seminales and Vasa Deferentia. Prostate Gland— The Prostate Gland, or something analogous to it, appears to exist in all the Mammalia, but varies exceedingly in its appearance in the different Species. In some, as the Dog and Cat tribe, it is single : in others, as Ruminants, it is double. In a small number, as the Horse and Elephant, it is qua- druple ; and in the Bat, it is lobulated. In most of the Animals of the class, the structure is as in Man. In others, as the Horse, Ruminants, and the Elephant, it has Cavities within. In the Cetacea, it is Cellular, and of great proportional size. It gene- rally surrounds the beginning of the Urethra, and ter- minates in that Canal, by one or more openings, at the side of the Verumontanum, though sometimes consi- derably farther forwards. In the Horse and Elephant, die Prostates are covered by Muscular Fibres, which proceed from the sides of the Bladder. In most of the Glires, and in the Hedge-hog and M 3 Mole?

In Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, they gra- dually become shorter, till at last they scarcely equal the length of the Body. The proportional length varies exceedingly in different Quadrupeds. In some, as the Ram, it is very great; in others, on the contrary, as in certain Species of Bats, the Intestines are only twice as long as the Body. The length of the Canal corresponds with the Food upon which the Animal is accustomed to live. It is ge- nerally shorter in Carnivorous than in Herbivorous Animals j but to this rule there are exceptions. The Seal, which is a Carnivorous Animal, has a very long Intestinal Canal; the Sloth, on the contrary, has a very short one, though it feeds upon vegetables. In Omnivorous Animals, as the Rat and Pig, the length of the Canal forms a medium between those which feed upon Flesh, and others living upon vege- table substances. A difference of length has also been observed between the Intestines of wild and tame Animals, some of the former

Muscles of the Lower Jaw.â€”The Temporal Muscle in the Ape kind differs but little from that in the Human Body. In the Ferae, it is much thicker and stronger in proportion to the size of the Animal, cor- responding with the hard substances the Teeth have to divide. In the Glires, the Muscle is less extensive than in the former ; but in some of the Rat kind, the Muscle is so extensive, as almost to meet its fellow on the op- posite side of the Head. The Masseter agrees with the Temporal Muscle in being thick and strong, corresponding with the force required in bringing the Jaws together. Besides the Muscles mentioned above, and which are common to Quadrupeds in genentl, many of the Glires, as the Squirrel, Rat, &c. have a fifth pair, for assisting in the elevation of the Under Jaw. Each takes its origin from the Upper Jaw, near the Infra-Orbitar Foramen, and is fixed to the Lower jaw near the Pterygoideus Externus. 'J he Pterygoid Muscles only vary in size and length, and in the obliquity of their Fibres, corresponding with the size and form of the Jaw. 'I he Digastric, in the Ape tribe only, possesses two distinct Fleshy Bellies, and a middle Tendon, perfo- ratin'.; CD

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 167 more distinctly separated from each other, than in Man. In the Ferae, in particular, as the Dog, Cat, Lion, &c. the Fissures are very deep, and run through the whole mass. The Lobes divided in this manner, have been considered by some Authors, as allowing the parts to slide on each other, in Animals with very flexible Spines ; while others are of a different opinion. In the orders Solipeda, Pecora, Belluce, and Cetacea, the Lobes are less numerous than in Man. The Hog has four, but the Hone, Ruminants, Ele- phant, and Cetacea, have only two, and these not more separated than in the Human Subject. In the Horse, Ox, &c. with rigid Spines, the Liver is in one piece, and has no Ligamentum Latum, being sufficiently sup- ported by the Muscles of the Abdomen. Hall-Bladder.â€”The Gall-bladder exists in all the Ape tribe ; in the Bradypoda, excepting the Sloths ; in most of the Ferae, as the Weasels, the Dog and Cat kind ; and in most Ruminants ; but it is wanting in many of the Clires, particularly in several of the Rat tribe ; in Soli- jwls; in the Camel, Goat, and Deer, among the Rumi- nants ; in the Elephant and Rhinoceros among the Bel- lucc; and in the Trichccus, Porpoise, and Dolphin, a- mong the Cetacea. All the Mammalia that want a Gall-bladder are vege- table eaters, excepting the Porpoise and Dolphin. Its situation is constantly under the right Lobe of the Liver, when there are two, and under the middle Lobe, when there are more than two. It has com- monly a Pyriform appearance, as in the Human Body; but in many it is round or cylindrical.

[Part I. 104. OF THE INTESTINES The Peritoneum and Mesentery exist in all Vertebral Animals, of course in the different Animals of this class, and are nearly of the same nature as in the Hu- man Body, the Mesentery being longer or shorter, and running in a straight, or an oblique, or in a circular direction, according to the length and course of the Intestines. In many Quadrupeds, it is longer than in Man, partly owing to the depth and length of the Ab- domen. Of the Amts and its Muscles.—In Mammalia and Birds, the Anus is placed at the posterior extremity of the Trunk of the Body, directly under the origin of the Tail, and generally in a direction opposite to the Mouth. In almost all Mammalia, it is a simple ori- fice, which only gives passage to the Faeces. In the Sloth and Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. In the Ornithorrynchus, the end of the Rectum is remarkable, for dilating into a Bag, which receives the Faeces, Urine, and the Sexual evacua- tions. The following numbers represent nearly the propor- tional length of the Intestinal Canal to that of the Body, in a few of the Mammiferous Animals mentioned in this work, the measurement being in a straight line from the Nose to the Anus. Taking the length of the Body as 1, that of the Intestines is as follows :—In the Ape tribe, varying from 6 to 8 ; in the Sloth, 3 to 1; Ant-eater, 3 ; Armadillo, 3; Ornithorrijnchus, 5 ; Bat, 3; Squirrel, 12; Bat, 8; Guinea Pig, 16; Wild Rab- bit, 11; Tame Rabbit, 9; Beaver, 9 ; Hedge-hog, 6 ; Mole,

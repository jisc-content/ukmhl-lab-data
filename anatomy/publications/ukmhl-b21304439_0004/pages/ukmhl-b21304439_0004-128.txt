According in he observa- tion of Farriers and others, the Milk J neisors appear at the beginning of the third week after birth. The four middle of these, termed the Pincers, fall in the 00th month, the four following in the 43d, and the four external, or Corner Teeth, in the 54th.

In the Corner Teeth it remains longer, in consequence of which the Animalâ€™s age can generally be known with considerable accuracy. After this period, the age is only judged of by the length of the Incisors, which are in a constant state of growth. Of the Molares, the two first in each Jaw appear at the end of the first week, the following at the end of the third, and the small Anterior Molaris between the fifth and sixth week. The first back Molaris appears near the end of the first year, the second near that of the second year. Be" tween the second and third year, the first Milk Molares fall, the third drops in three years; and it is not till five or six years that the last Molaris appears. The Temporary Molares are distinguished by being longer from before backwards than the permanent set. In Rumina/nts, there arc three Milk Molares, which

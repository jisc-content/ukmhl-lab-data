â€¢V Part II.] OF BIRDS. 229 OF THE HEART AND BLOOD- VESSELS. i The Heart corresponds in its principal parts with that in Mammalia. It has four cavities, which have the same general appearance, and transmit the Blood in the same manner. It is of a conical form, but the cone varies in length or in roundness in different Birds. The situation is nearly the same as in Mammalia, but nearer the an- terior part of the Thorax. The Pericardium is covered by the Membrane formed by the Pleura and Peritoneum. The Auricles have no Appendices externally. The Ventricles have Columnae Carneae in proportion to their thickness and strength. The Valve corresponding with the Tricuspid in Mammalia, is peculiar, in being formed of a strong fleshy flap, while the other Valves resemble those in the former class. The Pulmonary Artery is proportionally small, the Lungs occupying less space. The Aorta divides near its origin into three smaller Aortas. The right forms the Posterior or Descending Aorta, the other two form the Subclavian Arteries. The Subclavians give off the Carotids, Vertebrals, Branches to the Neck and Thorax, then divide into Radial and Ulnar, which are dispersed on the Wings. P 3 The

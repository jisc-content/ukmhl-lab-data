The matter secreted in these Bags may be exeremen- titious in some Animals; but in others, it appears to lubricate the Skin, and defend it from being injured by the Fceces. i The Badger, Opossum, and other Marsupial Animals, have Pouches on the Abdomen, lined with fine Hair, and discharging; from their surface secretions of a Seba- ceous nature, which, when recent, have a disagreeable odour, but are found, after being dried, like the Scent Bags in many other Animals, to acquire an agreeable musky smell. Over, the Sacrum of the Aper Moscifer, or Mexican Hog, there is a Gland termed Dorsal, some inches in length, and lobulated, from which a Duct opens on the Skin, and pours' out a liquor which also has a musky smell. In the Feet of several Ruminants, especially in Sheep, are Glandular Cavities, lined with Hair, and sending out an Excretory Duct, which opens at the junction of the Hooves.

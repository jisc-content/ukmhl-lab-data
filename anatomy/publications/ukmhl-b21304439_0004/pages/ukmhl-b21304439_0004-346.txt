The Muscles which affect them arise from the edges of the Foot of the Animal, and ex- tend as far as the Eyes. By these the Tentacula arc drawn to the Head, something after the manner of an inverted Finger of a Glove. By a set of Circular Fibres contracting in succession, the Eye is restored to its for- mer external appearance. The Organ of Hearing in the Cuttle-Fish is a simple Bag, concealed in the Annular Cartilage at the base of the great Tentacula. In the Sepia Officinalis, the Sac lias a Bone suspended in the Fluid which it contains. In the Sepia Octopus, there is only a chalky substance. The Organ of Smell is supposed to belong to many of the Mollusca, but the situation is unknown. The Lips, in the Animals of this class, are in some short or real Lips; in others, elongated into a Tube or Proboscis. In the Cephalopoda, they are in form of a fleshy circle; in the Gasteropoda, they are merely a lon- gitudinal Slit. The Proboscis in many Mollusca, as the Whelk, &c. is a fleshy Tube for seizing the Food at a distance. It forms a kind of double cylinder, which can move in every direction, and retract within the Body. The Tongue varies much in length in some of this class, as the‚Äù Limpet, where it is almost as long as the Body ; but in such cases there is no Proboscis. In the Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda, the Tongue is covered with Spines directed backwards. The Sepia, Snails, and greater part of the Gasteropoda, have a Cartilagi- nous

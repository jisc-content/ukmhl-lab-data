Muscles of the Foot.—The Gastrocnemius is always present, but the Soleus is smaller than in Man, and is remarkably slender in Solipeds and Ruminants. In Monkeys, the Plantaris is continued over the Os Calcis, to the Aponeurosis Plantaris. The Tibialis Anticus, in Animals which have no Great Toe, as the Dog and Rabbit, is inserted into the first of their Toes. In So- lipeds and Ruminants, it is inserted into the Base of the Canon Bone.

Other digitated Animals have the same number as in the Human Body. The Extensor Pollicis is wanting in Animals destitute of a Great Toe, as the Dog and Rabbit. In the Solipeds and Ruminants, the Fleshy Fibres arise from the Canon Bone, and are inserted into the Tendon of the Exten-

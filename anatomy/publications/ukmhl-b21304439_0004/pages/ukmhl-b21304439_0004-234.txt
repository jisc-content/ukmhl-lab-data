!*3 l ORGANS OF VOICE, See. [Pakt II. The Vocal Organ is furnished with Muscles Irom the surrounding parts* and these vary in number m diffe- rent Species. The strength of the Muscles of the Inferior Larynx, was found, by Mr Hunter, to be in proportion to that of the Voice. They appeared stronger in the Common Code, but weaker in the Capon ; and here the Animal has not the power of crowing. The Muscles of the Larynx of the Nightingale were found stronger than in any other Animal of the same size. At the Inferior Larynx the Voice of the Animal is chiefly formed, as may be observed by cutting the I ra- cliea across below the Superior Larynx, in a living Bird ; or in a dead one, after performing the same ope- ration, blowing in air till it distends the Body, then suddenly forcing it out again ; or by cutting out t e under end, with part of the Bronchi, and blowing air from the Pulmonary Extremity. 'I he Inferior Glottis is compared to the reed at the mouth of the wind instruments, ns the Clarionet, &c. the Superior Glottis to the holes, and the Traehea to the Body of the instrument. â– 1 he Bronchi are formed of two Tubes, winch, hke the Trachea, are commonly cylindrical, hut sometimes have dilatations and contractions, and are composed ol Cartilaginous or Osseous Arches, the curves varytng occasionally by the action of the Muscles. 'J he Bronchi proceed in angles more or less acute, but are never subdivided, till they enter the Lungs, after which they lay aside their Cartdagtnous struc- ture, and become entirely Membranous; hut the

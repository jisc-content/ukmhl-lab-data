They have neither moveable Cartilages nor Muscles, but are formed of Laminae covered by the Skin, which is expanded over the Beak. There is no proper Ethmoid Bone in Birds, though they have distinct Ossa Spongiosa, which divide the Cavity of the Nose into different Meatus. The Membrana Pituitaria is plentifully supplied with Vessels, which furnish abundance of Mucus. The Internal Nares commonly open by one chink upon the Palate, which is beset with soft pointed Pa; pill*, turned backward, and furnished with Muscles, by which it can be shut at pleasure. The Palatum Molle is wan tins-. O â€¢ The Foramina Jncisiva vary in number, size, and situation, iu different Birds In some, there is but a single opening, which is large; in others, there are more, but small. In some, it is placed near the point, in others, at the base of the Bill. The Nose, as in the former class of Animals, is co- piously furnished with Nerves; the Olfactory come from the fore part of the Anterior Lobe of the Brain, and pass along a Canal, after which they form innumerable Fibrilla?, dispersed upon the Membrana Mucosa. In Water Fowls, particularly in the Duck tribe, the Nerves of the Nose, viz. the Olfactory, and a Branch ol the Fifth Pair, are uncommonly large, and can be easily traced to the end of their Bills; in consequence of which, they-are enabled to search for their Food in water, mud, See.

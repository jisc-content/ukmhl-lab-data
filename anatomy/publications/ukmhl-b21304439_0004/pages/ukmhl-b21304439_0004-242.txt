t>42 OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part II. tinal Canal is much shorter than in Mammalia. It varies from twice to five times the length of the Animal. In the Ostrich, on the contrary, it is found to be between twenty and thirty times the length. 'I he Canal is also shorter and narrower in Carnivorous Birds than in those living on vegetable Food,, yet many Fish-eaters have it equally extensive. In all Birds, there is a distinction into small and great Intestines, though, to external appearance, the .difference is very inconsiderable. The small Intestines are commonly longer than the great, as in Mammalia; but sometimes shorter, as in the Ostrich. The situation, form, and structure of the Intestines, is nearly the same in the greater number of Birds. The Duodenum begins near the termination of the Eso- phagus, but there is a prominence, in some, as the com- mon Fowl, between the two openings, which may prevent the Food from escaping till properly digested. The Gut hangs loose, in the common Fowl, towards the right side of the Abdomen, the rest of the small In- testines making turns, and uniting themselves to each other. The Intestines are destitute of \ alvuhe Conm- ventes in Birds in general; but in many, there is a Villous appearance in them. There are commonly two Intestina Ctrca m Birds, a few of the Aquatic kind excepted, which have only one. The Gcca are inserted at the sides of the termination of the Ilium. They are generally smaller at their base, and enlarge towards their shut extrenut.es. They he parallel to the small Guts, and contain the same kind ot Aliment with them. In Granivorous and Omnivorous

160 OF THE INTESTINES [Part t found through the whole length of the posterior extre- mity of the small Intestine. Oftty Intestines in particular In the Ape kind, the Intestinal Canal bears a strong resemblance to that of Man, but the whole of them, except the Ouvungs^ want the Appendix Vermiformis. I lie Rradypdda have tire Canal of a moderate length, most ot the Animals of this class beino1 of the O Carnivorous kind. The Sloth, on the contrary, living on vegetables, is remarkable for the shortness of the Intestines. In the Ornithorrynchus, the structure of the Intestines differs from that in other Mammalia. There are many transverse Plicae resembling those in Fishes; the Cae- cum is in form of an Appendix Vermiformis; the Co- lon enlarges towards its outer extremity, forming a Cloaca, as in Birds. It has many Sinuosities in the right Ilypochondrium ; and upon the inner Membrane,- Plicae run in a longitudinal direction. lhc Bat tribe, though Carnivorous, has a Cellular Colon and a large Caecum. They have the Intestinal Canal the shortest of any of the Quadrupeds, being only once and a half, or twice the length of the Body. In the Vespertilio Vampyrus, on the contrary, or Rousette, which lives on vegetables, it is proportionally longer than in the Human Body. Among the Glires or Rodentia, which feed upon ve- getables, the Intestines are from six to sixteen times the length of the Body; but their diameter is not very con- siderable, though there is generally a very large Caecum.

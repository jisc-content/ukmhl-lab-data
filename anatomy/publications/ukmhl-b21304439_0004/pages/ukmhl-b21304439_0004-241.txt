In the Hawk kind, the Esophagus is so wide, as to be considered by some a kind of Crop; and so large is this passage in some Fish-eaters, that whole Animals aie contained in it till the Stomach can receive them. The structure of the Stomach of these Birds differs much from that of the plurality of Stomachs in the former kinds, being merely a Musculo-membranous Sac. i he Food, too, is here more easily digested. But there are many intermediate links in the diversified structure of Stomachs in the Animals of this class. Most Piscivorous Birds want the Crop; when this is the case, the Infundibulum is larger, as if to supply its place. AThe Pylorus, in Birds, has no Sphincter. The lutes-

Part I.] 1G1 OF MAMMALIA. Vol. IV. L The In the Rat, Hare, Castor, and Porcupine, the Caecum is so large as to fill a great part of the Abdomen. In the Rat tribe, which are Omnivorous, the Canal is shorter than in the other Glires; but the Caecum surpasses the size of the Stomach, though it varies much in the different kinds. The Appendix Vermi- formis, as already noticed, is found only in the Phas- colome. In the Hare and Rabbit$ the CaCciim is longer than the whole Animal, and is furnished internally with a pe- culiar Spiral Valve. The Colon is also dilated. In the Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. Of the Force, the Iledge-Hog has neither a proper Colon nor a Caecum. The Badger, which is not strict- ly a Carnivorous Animal, and the Glis Esculentus, or Rell-mouse, have no distinction between small and great Intestines. The Hedge-Hog, Bear, and some other Animals of this kind, that walk upon the soles of their feet, and are Omnivorous, have a long but narrow Canal, and no Caecum, rtor distinction of large Intestines. In the Opossum, there is a long Colon, and a large Caecum. The Kangaroos have no Cells in the Canal, but have a large Caecum. In the Dog, the Duodenum is fixed at the Pylorus to the Liver, but afterwards a large portion hangs loose in the Abdomen. The inner side of the Intestine has rcction. The Caecum makes turns upon the Ilium.

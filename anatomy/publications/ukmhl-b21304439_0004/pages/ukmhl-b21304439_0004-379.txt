PART IX. The OF ZOOPHYTES. Zoophytes have, like Worms, a Cuticle, though in some not very distinct, but no part analogous to the Cutis. The Corpus Mucosum is seen only in a few. The Echinus is covered with a Calcareous Skin, upon which are Tubercles regularly disposed ; and innume- rable Spines, by which the Animal can move in what- ever position it happens to be placed. Among the Spines are a set of smaller Bodies, of different forms, which have been sometimes considered as a sort of An- tennae, supplying the place of the Organs of the Senses in the higher classes of Animals. In the Asterias, the covering is of a firm fibrous tex- ture, and has the interstices of the Fibres filled with Calcareous Granules. The Body is divided into Radii or Branches, of which there are commonly five, though sometimes A smaller, at other times a greater number. Throughout the whole length of the Branches, several rows of Feet are attached, which give the Animal a certain degree of motion.

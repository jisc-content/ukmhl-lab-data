OF MAMMALIA K 2 Number PartJI.]; OF THE LUNGS. The Lungs agree in form, connexion, and structure, with those in Man, but the left bears a greater propor- tion to the right. Here, also, they are closely applied to the walls of the Thorax. In the Amphibious Quadrupeds and Cetacea, they are of a firmer texture, and have more of an elongated and flattened appearance. For the most part there is a division into Lobes, and these are rather more deeply divided than in the Hu- man Body. The greater number is in the Right Side. In many, as the Dog, one of the Lobes goes behind the Heart, and between it and the Right Side of the Mediastinum; in consequence of which a Bulla of air is frequently observed upon opening the cavity of the Thorax, which has been mistaken by some for air confined, during life, between the Lungs and their Pa- rietes.

OF THE BRAIN 81. [Part I. OF THE BRAIN. The Brain in Mammalia completely fills the Craniumy and has nearly the same parts as in the Human Bo- dy ; but there are certain peculiarities which distin- guish the Brain of all other Animals from that of Man. These consist chiefly in its being much smaller in proportion to the Body, and also to the Cerebellum and Spinal Marrow, but more particularly to the Nerves arising from it. To this last circumstance there are no exceptions, though there are several to the others. Some of the Ape and Mouse kind equal Man in the proportion of the size of the Brain, and certain Birds surpass him ; but, according to Soemmerrinc and Elbe, the size of the Brain, to the Nerves arising from it, bears an exact ratio to the faculties of the Ani- malâ€™s Mind; and though, in some small Animals, the Brain is proportionally larger to the size of the Body than in Man, yet all, even the Monkey tribe, are far inferior to him in respect to the proportion between the Brain and Nerves. It is difficult to ascertain the exact proportion the Brain bears to the rest of the Body, on account of the diffe- rent

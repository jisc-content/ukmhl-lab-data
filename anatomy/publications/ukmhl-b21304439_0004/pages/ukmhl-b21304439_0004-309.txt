OF FISHES. 309 Part IV.] \ consisting of some hundred pentagonal or hexagonal co- lumns, closely compacted, and giving somewhat the appearance of a Honeycomb. The Columns are form- ed of transparent Laminae, and are connected together by transverse Tendinous Fibres. They are divided by .a great number of thin partitions placed over each other, but leaving small spaces between them, which are full of a glairy liquor. Minute Blood-vessels are dispersed upon this Organ. Its Nerves are ot extra- ordinary size, and are furnished by four principal Branches. The first is the Inferior Maxillary, or third portion of the Fifth Pair, and corresponds with that which, in the Back of the Skate, sends a very large Nerve to the origin of the Mucous Ducts. The other Nerves are from the Eighth Pair, and come to the E- lectrical Organ after supplying the Gills. The whole of this remarkable substance is found to correspond in its elfects with those of an Electrical Ma- chine. The upper and under surfaces of the Animal are in the plus and minus states of Electricity, and the shock is given at the will of the Creature; but differs from that coming from an Electrical Apparatus, in pro- ducing neither light nor sound. The Electrical Organ, in the Gymnotus, is more de- veloped than that of the Torpedo. It composes a great part of the thickness of the very large Tail, and ex- tends from within a little distance of the Head to the posterior extremity of the Animal. It is divided into four portions, called by Mu Hunter, Great and Small Organs. The Great Organs are placed above the Small U 3 at I

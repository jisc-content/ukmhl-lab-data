The Skeleton of Birds lias a considerable uniformity in the whole class, and bears a strong analogy to that of the Mammalia; but the large Bones, in Birds of whatever shape, are destitute of Marrow in their inter- nal Cavities, in place of which they contain air, and communicate with the Lungs by considerable apertures. Foetal Birds, however, or such as have just quitted the Shell, have their Bones filled with Bloody Marrow, which, in general, is soon absorbed, and, in Aquatic Birds, the greater part disappears. The Scull, in this class of Animals, has no Sutures, at least in the Adult state, but is in a manner consoli- dated into one piece.

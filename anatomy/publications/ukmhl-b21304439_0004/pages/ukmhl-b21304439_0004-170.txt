OF THE PANCREAS 170 [Part I. In the Ourang-outang, it is of the same figure as in Man. In the other Quadrupeds, it is Jess or more di- vided. There is commonly but one Pancreatic Duct; it seldom happens that any Branch goes off from it to terminate separately in the Duodenum. For the most part, the Pancreatic and Biliary Ducts have a common opening. 01 the Apes, some liave the Ducts united ; in others, and also in the IIarcPorcu- pine, and Hog, they terminate at a distance. In the Dog, one Pancreatic Duct goes into the Ductus Communis, and another into the Intestine. In the Cut, it termi- nates in one of the Cells of the Ampulla in the Ductus Communis. In most of the other Carnivora, the Pan- creatic and Biliary Ducts arc generally united. In the Horse, they terminate separately, though near each other. In Ruminants, they commonly unite at their termination. In the Pig> the Pancreatic Duct ends at a great distance from the Ductus Communis. In the Elephant, as in the Cat, it opens into one of the Cells of the Ampulla in the Ductus Communis, Spleen. Tiie Spleen is found not only in all Mammalia, but in most Vertebral Animals, and is observed to diminish in the proportional size from Quadrupeds down to Fishes. There is only one Spleen in Quadrupeds, but in the Dolphin and Porpoise, there are several of unequal magnitude, but so small, that if taken collectively, they would

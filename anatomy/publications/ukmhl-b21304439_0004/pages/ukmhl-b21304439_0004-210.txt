OF THE MUSCLES [Part II. 21 CP Digitorilm. The Extensor Longus Pollicis is want- ing ; four small Muscles supply the place of the Extensor Brevis; a Flexor Brevis Pollicis is situat- ed in the back part of the Tarsus. There are long Flexors of the Toes, which are divided into three masses; these come partly from the Os Femoris, and partly from the Bones of the Leg. They have connect- ed to them an Accessory Flexor, which comes from the Pubes, and sends a Tendon over the Knee. The diffe- rent Tendons run under the Heel, and are united by Fibres to each other ; and one set of Tendons perforate another, and are fixed to the different Phalanges of the Toes. By this mechanism, the Bird is supported, or can lay hold of Branches of Trees, &c. when roosting; the weight of the Body giving that degree of flexion to the Knee and Heel, which produces the necessary con- traction of the "Poes. By this contrivance, also, Ra- pacious Birds seize their prey while pouncing on it. When they wish to disengage themselves, they do it readily by raising the Body, after which the 'lâ€™oes are expanded. , OF THE INTEGUMENTS. The Integuments consist of the same parts as in Mam- malia. The Cuticle is very thin, and. in the Legs and Feet.

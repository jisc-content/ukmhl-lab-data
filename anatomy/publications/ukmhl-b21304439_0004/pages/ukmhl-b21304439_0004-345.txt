Part V.] OF MOLLUSCA. 345 l perforate the Sclerotis, and swell out into large Ganglia, from which Fibrillae go through the Choroides to form the Retina. A pair of Nerves belong to the Muscles of the Sac, and another to the Organ of Hearing. A pair near the Heart forms a Plexus, which supplies the dif- ferent Viscera. In the Sepia Loligo, the Brain consists of a small round Body, behind which are two little Lobes analogous to the Cerebellum. These send off* a mere Filament in place of a Spinal Marrow. On each side of the Brain is a large mass, which sends off the Optic Nerve. In the N??m/and Slug, the Brain is situated, in the former over, and in the latter behind, the Esopha- gus, and sends off a Process on each side of it, both u- niting below into a large Ganglion, from which and the Brain, Nerves are sent to the different parts of the Body. Eye.â€”The Sepia alone of this class of Animals possess- es true Eyes. Here we observe their great size, and the Skin covering them loosely as in Serpents; a transpa- rent Membrane underneath, which supplies the place of a Cornea, and to which the Lens is closely connected without the intervention of an Aqueous Humour; the Iris intimately connected to the Sclerotica, and a Semi- lunar Process projecting at the edge of the Pupil; the Ciliary Processes large, and forming a Zone about the Lens; between the Sclerotic and Choroid Coats, Glan- dular Bodies and the Ganglion of the Optic Nerve, which separate these two Coats from each other; the inner sur- face of the Choroides of a deep purple colour, and only two Muscles belonging to the Ball of the Eve. The parts considered as the Eye of Mollusca with 1 enfacula, or Horns, as the Snail and Slug, are pla- ced

OF MOLLUSCA. I 348 [Part V. yem returns bv tbc other. The Branchul ^ ein termi- nates in the Aortic Ventricle, from the opposite ends of which the Aortas go out, sending Branches to the different parts of the Body, from the extremities of which the Veins return by the Yen* Cavae. The other Mollusca have a simple Heart, consisting of an Auricle and a Ventricle. The Gasteropoda, as the Slug, Snail, Limpet, &c. have each also one Auricle and one Ventricle. The Veins of the Body, upon approaching the Lung, change into a Pulmonary Artery, in the manner the Vena Portae Abdominalis changes into the Porta Hepa- tica; the Pulmonary Veins go to the Auricle, and this to the Ventricle, which sends, by an Aorta, Branches to the different parts of the Body. The Pulmonary System here is situated in the vicinity of the Rectum, by which the Vessels receive more readily the Veins of the Intestines. The Acephalous Mollusca, as the Muscle, and diffe- rent Concha: Bivalves Equivalves, have the Heart near the Rectum. The Auricle receives the Blood from the Branchiae, and sends it to the Ventricle, whence it is transmitted to the Body. Organs of Respiration.â€”'These consist of Branchiae, which are either concealed or exposed. The Cephalo- poda and Accpliala have them shut; the Gasteropoda, have them in different situations. In the Cuttle-Fish, the Lungs form two Conical Bodies, lying on each side of the Sheath, which incloses the Viscera of the Abdo- men. The Slug and Snail, among the Gasteropoda, have

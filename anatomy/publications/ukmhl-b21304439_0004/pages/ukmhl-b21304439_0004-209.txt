The Ad- ductor Externus Phalangis Secundas, which is analo- gous to the Flexor Proprius Indicis, arises from the External Condyle, having its Tendon fixed to the back of the Metacarpus and second Phalanx of the Great Finger. Muscles of the Pelvis and Inferior Extremity.â€”The Psoas Parvus and Magnus, the Uiacus Interims, and Quadratus Luinborum, are wanting. There are two Ad- > ductor Muscles of the Thigh, situated as in Mammalia, and a Muscle analogous to the Pectineus, which is conti- nued to join the Flexor Perforatus of the second and fifth Toes. The three Glutei have the same proportions as in Quadrupeds. The Pvriformis and Gemini are wanting. The Muscle analogous to the Quadratus Femoris is re- markable for its great size. The Obturator Internus goes over the Hole analogous to the Foramen Thyroi- deum. The Extensors of the Leg are nearly as in Quadrupeds. Of the Flexors, there are two somewhat analogous to the Biceps and Semi-membranosus; a third which is intermediate, but is sometimes wanting, particularly in Birds of prey ; and a fourth, which forms the anterior part of the Thigh, and is similar to the Sartorius. The Tendons of the Gastrocnemii remain separate to near the Heel. The Soleus is fixed to a Linea Aspera, which belongs to the Tibia. There is a Peroneus Brevis, and a Muscle analogous to the Pe- roneus Tertius in Man. 1 here is an Extensor Longus of the three Ante- rior loes, corresponding to the Extensor Longus A ol. IV.

[Part 1 OF THE BONES 50 of this family, the Bones of the Leg and Thigh are much shorter than those of the Fore-arm and Hu- merus. In the Rat and Mole, the Tibia and Fibula form one continued Bone for a considerable part of their length. In the Rodentia, the Fibula is placed entirely behind the Tibia; also in the Dog, where the two Bones are attached through their whole length. In the Horse, the Fibula is only a Rudiment anehy- losed by age to the upper part of the Tibia. In Ru- minants, it is wanting. In the Pig and Elephant, the Fibula is anchylosed through its whole length to the Tibia. Tarsus.â€”In Quadrupeds with Toes, the Tarsal Bones have a near resemblance to those in Man; they differ only in a few particular circumstances. In Mon- keys, strictly so called, the Os Calcis generally wants the Tuberosity of the Heel, at its Posterior Extremity ; and the Tarsus is articulated with the Leg Bones, in such an oblique manner, that the Foot rests more on its outer edge than on the Sole. In some of the Lemurs, the Os Calcis and Os Scaphoidcs are so long, as to give the Foot the appearance of a Hand. In Carnivora, the Ginglymus at the lower end of the Tibia is more complete than in Man. I he Heel is longer, and quite straight, in those that walk only on the Toes. In tjie Mole, the Tibia alone is articulated with the Tarsus. Rodentia have the Os Calcis much elongated. In some Animals, as the Opossum and O Beaver, the Tarsus has a Supernumerary Bone on its inner side. / SoTipcds

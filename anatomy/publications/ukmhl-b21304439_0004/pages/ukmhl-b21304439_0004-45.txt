In such Apes as want Tails, this Bone is found to have at most three pieces; but these are per- forated for the passage of the Spinal Marrow and Nerves. In other Quadrupeds, the Vertebrae of the Tail near- est the Sacrum are perforated for the Spinal Marrow, and have Articular, Transverse, and Spinous Processes, while the other, diminishing gradually in size to the end of the Tail, have only small Processes for the inser- tion of the Muscles.

In the Beaver, where the Tail is used as a Trowel, the Caudal Vertebrae are remarkable for the size of the Transverse Processes. The following Table gives the number of the Verte- brae found in a few of the Species of this Class,

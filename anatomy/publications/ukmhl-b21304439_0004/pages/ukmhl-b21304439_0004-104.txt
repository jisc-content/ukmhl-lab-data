OF THE EAR [Part I. 10* in others, as the Ant-eater, both the Foramina are oval, and nearly equal in size. In Carnivora, Solipeds, Ra- min ants, and Cetacea, the Oochlear Foramen is the largest; in some it is double or triple the size. In the Hare and Opossum, the Vestibular Opening is by much the largest. In all Mammalia, the two Foramina are filled, the Cochlear with Membrane, and the Vestibular with Bone. The Labyrinth is nearly similar to that in Man, but the proportional size varies much among the different Species. As in the Human Subject, also, it is com- monly hollowed out in the Pars Petrosa ; but in some, as the Bat and Mole, it is visible in the Cranium with- out any preparation. In some it is large; in others, small. The Cochlea is almost always turbinated, and the number of turns are commonly the same in the dif- ferent individuals, excepting a few, as the Guinea Pig, Porcupine, and Indian Hog, where there is a turn more, and the Cetacea, where there is a turn less, than in Man. In most Carnivora, and in the Horse, Hog, and Elephant, the Cochlea is larger in proportion to the semicircular Canals than in Man. In Bats, it is re- markably large, compared with the Canals. The size of the two Canals of the Cochlea is in general nearly equal; but in some, as the Dog, Horse, and Elephant, the Scala Tympani is the larger. In the Cetacea, the \ semicircular Canals are proportionally so small, that by some they have been overlooked, and by others, as Dr Camper, their existence has been denied. The

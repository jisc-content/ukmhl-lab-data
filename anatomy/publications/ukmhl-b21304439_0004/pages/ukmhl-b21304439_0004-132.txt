l:J2 [Part I OF T11K HEART, &c. The OF THE HEART AND BLOOD- VESSELS. The Heart has the same general appearance in all Mammalia as in the Human Body, varying only a little in some particulars. A Pericardium belongs to every individual in the class, but, on account of the manner in which the Heart is situated, it has less connexion with the Dia- phragm. The form of the Heart in the Ape, Ilorsc, and Ox, is that of an obtuse Cone ; in other Quadrupeds, it is either rounded, or short and wide, or long and narrow, or notched at the point. In the Ourang-outang, the Heart possesses nearly the same obliquity, and rests on the Diaphragm nearly in the same manner as in Man. The rest of the Monkey tribe have the point only touching the Diaphragm, and turn- ing a little to the left. In other Quadrupeds, the Heart is placed in a longitudinal direction, and rests upon the Sternum, the point touching the Diaphragm in some, and placed at a distance from it. in others. At the meet- ing of the Venae Cavae in the Right Auricle, a fleshy projection is found, termed Tubcrculum Loweri, which is not found in the Human Body.

At the posterior extremity of the last Joint, the Vessels are found to be impervious. The Ascaricles have a simple Canal, and nearly equal throughout, running in a longitudinal direction. The anterior portion has a slight dilatation, considered as a sort of Stomach. The Lumbricus Ilumanus, or Ascaris Lumbricoides, has a simple Canal, extending through the Body, and ending near the posterior extremity of the Animal. In the Trichuris Hominis, (a Worm about two inches long, ending in a filiform Tail), the Intesti- nal Canal extends through the whole length of the Body. The Liver is wanting in all Worms.

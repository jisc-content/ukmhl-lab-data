OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part II. in a warm atmosphere. The outer Glaire, which is more fluid and transparent than the inner, can be readi- ly separated from it after being boded, or otherwise hardened into a coagulum. The inner Glaire incloses the Yolk, which is contain- ed in a Membrane termed Yolk-bag. The Yolk is pro- portionally heavier than the Glaire, and has attached to the Membrane which covers it, two white Bodies like coagulated Glaire, termed Chalazte or Grandines. The other extremities of these Bodies, considerably expand- ed, penetrate and float in the Albumen. The Chalazae form two ends of an axis, being placed at the opposite sides of the Yolk, but at a little distance from its centre, in consequence of which the large por- tion preponderates. On the surface of the Yolk-bag is the Cicalricnla or Macula, termed also the Tread of the Code, which is surrounded by concentric circles, the Halemes or Cir- coli, the use of which, and of the Chalazae, is not yet fully ascertained. The Cicatricula, being placed upon the smaller portion of the sphere of the Yolk, is found uppermost in whatever position the Egg happens to be ^Changes produced upon, the Egg in time of Hatching. -This process is effected by the assistance of Atmo- spheric Air, and a certain degree of heat, both of w nc . circumstances are produced by Incubation, or by the Egg being kept for a sufficient length of time â– " air heated to'an equal degree with that produced by the Animal. But varnishing an Egg all over stops t ie pio- gress of Incubation, by obstructing the access of the ^,

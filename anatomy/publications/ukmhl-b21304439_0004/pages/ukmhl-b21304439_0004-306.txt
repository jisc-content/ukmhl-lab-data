/ :50() OF THE BRAIN, kc. [Part IV. Tlie Olfactory Nerves, in certain Fishes, as the Skate and Shark, are so large at their origin, as by some to have been considered the proper Brain, or at least its An- terior Lobes. At their roots, each forms a large Bulb, from which the Nerve passes towards the Nares. In some, the Nerve is at first slender, and afterwards Â« forms a large Ganglion; in others, it is thick and shoit, and surrounded with Cortical Substance. It terminates by a Ganglion, which is separated from the Nostril by a Cribriform Membrane, which gives passage to the Nerves into the Nose. In Osseous Fishes, the Olfactory Nerves are long and slender, in some surrounded by Cartilage, in others by Membrane. The Genera Cyprinus and Gadus have, at the Nasal extremity of the Nerve, a spherical Ganglion, composed in part of Cineritious Substance. The Optic Nerves, in the generality of Fishes, par- ticularly in those of the Osseous kind, cross each other without being incorporated. Ihey are attached merely by Cellular Substance, the Right Nerve going to the Left Eye, and the Left Nerve to the Right Eye. In some Fishes, they are Fibrous ; in others, they have a laminated or plaited appearance. The Third and Fourth Pairs arc dispersed nearly as in the former classes of Animals. The Fifth comes of! from Tubercles behind the Cerebellum, which, in the Raja, are remarkable for their great size. Each di- vides into three Branches, as well as in the Human Body ; and these go to the outer part of the Nose, to the sides of the Mouth, and to the Face in general. In

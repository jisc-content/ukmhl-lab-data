356 OF CRUSTACEA. [Part VI Brain is divided above into four Lobes, from which a pair of Optic Nerves are sent off. Four Nerves pass to the four Antennae and adjacent parts. From the pos- terior part of the Brain Nerves go off, which form a Collar round the Esophagus. The different Nerves form Ganglia, which supply more particularly the seve- ral Muscles. In the Lobster kind in general, the Eye is placed on a moveable Tubercle, and is somewhat conical. When magnified, it presents different Facets, which are hard and transparent, representing so many Corneae. Lin- ing these, there is an opaque Pigment, which appears to leave no aperture for the passage of the light. At a little distance from the Corneae, is a dark-coloured Membrane, considered as the Choroides, which has a production of the Optic Nerve on its posterior, as well as its anterior surface, and therefore forming a sort of double Retina. But how the light can act upon the bottom of the Eye through the opaque lining of the Cornea,—and whether these Animals, from the com- pound nature of their Eyes, see objects multiplied or single,—are circumstances not understood. The jEar, in the Lobster, is a small Sac inclosed in a scaly cylinder. At the base of the Antennae, the Nerves pass through this cylinder into the Sac, the opposite ex- tremity of which is inclosed by an elastic Membiane analogous to the Membrana Tympani, or the fenestra Ovalis, and is observed at the bottom of the large An- tennae.

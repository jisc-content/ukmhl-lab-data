They are commonly of an oval, but sometimes of a roundish form, and vary much in size in the different Genera and Species. They increase considerably in bulk in the season of their sexual intercourse, and are proportionally larger than in Mammalia. 1 hey are co- vered, and fixed in the Body, by a Process of the Pe- ritoneum, and consist of a Congeries of delicate Semi- nal Ducts, which are less distinct than in the former class of Animals. The Epididymis here is closely connected to the Tes- tis, and sends out the Vas Deferens, which runs in a flexuous manner near the corresponding Ureter. It becomes larger by degrees, and terminates in the Cloa- ca, distinct from the Ureter ; but frequently, before its termination, it dilates into an oval Sac, that is consi- dered by some authors as supplying the place of a Ve- sicula Seminalis. The Duct is commonly full of an opaque white fluid, and its outer extremity, in some Birds, as the Duck, is situated between two Erector Muscles, which, by compression, can discharge its con- tents. The Prostate Gland, in this class of Animals, is wanting. In general, each Vas Deferens terminates in a Penis peculiar to itself, which is a mere Papilla, placed at the side of the common Clcaca, and pointing outwards, as in the Cock, Turkey, Pigeon, and large Birds of prey. In some, as the Duck, Swan, &c. the Vasa Defe- rentia terminate in a single Penis, which is of con- siderable size, and in the relaxed situation, is a simple

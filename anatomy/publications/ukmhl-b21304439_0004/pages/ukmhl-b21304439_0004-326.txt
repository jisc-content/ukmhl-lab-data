There arc, in most Fishes, four Gills in each side, resting on an equal number of arched portions of Car- tilage or Bone, connected to the Os Hyoides; and these arc fixed to the Head, or to the first \ ertebrne. Each of the Gills consists of two ranges of Cartila- ginous Lamina', and aie joined together for two-thirds of their inner edge. i he Laminae issue like rays, and have the Branches of the Pulmonary Artery minutely dispersed upon them. In many Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Raja, Squalus, &c. there are five Gills on each side. In the lumpi ey there are seven. In a small Animal, the Hippocampus, eight. In the first set of Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Skate. &c. there aie, on the inferior suiface of the Ani- mal, Holes equal to the number of the Gills, and on the Dorsal side, an opening behind each Eye; but in the other kinds, there is only a single opening exter- nally

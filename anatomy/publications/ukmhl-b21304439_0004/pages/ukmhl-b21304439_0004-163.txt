Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. ' 1G3 The L 2 small Intestines have many large Yalvula? Conniventes. The Colon forms two transverse convolutions, like Pouches, which cover most of the Intestines. It is tacked up externally by longitudinal Muscular Bands, and has large Cells also internally. I he Valvula Coli is of a circular form. The Caecum is proportionally short, but very large, and, like the Colon, is formed into Cells; The inner side of the Canal has no Villi, but numerous short Papillae. In the Rhinoceros, the small Intestines are remarka- bly short, but the surface internally is increased in its extent by numerous Processes of an oblong form, co- vered with conspicuous Villi, and appearing to supply the place of Valvulae Conniventes in Man. The Cae- cum of this Animal is still larger than that of the Horse, and adds much to the bulk of the Abdomen. The Intestines, in the Hippopotamus, have nearly same width for about two-thirds of their length, but after- wards become almost double the diameter throughout. In the Cetacea, the Whales are observed to have their Intestines proportionally longer than the other Carnivora. There is no great difference in their size; they diminish gradually from the Pylorus to the Anus. They have no Caecum nor Cells, but are furnished with longitudinal Plica? of a zig-zag appearance, and are covered with Villi. In the Porpoise, the Guts are long, and, as in the other Cetacea, are all nearly of the same size, diminishing a little from the Pylorus to the Anus. There is no Caecum, nor Valvulae Conniventes, in any part of the Canal.

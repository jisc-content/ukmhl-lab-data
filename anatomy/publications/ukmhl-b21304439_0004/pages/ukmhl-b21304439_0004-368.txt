[Part VII. MU OF INSECTS. / In Insects, as in other Animals, the same propor- tional size k preserved in the Animal and Vegetable caters, the Canal being always short in the former, and long in the latter. In the Dragon Fly, which is a Car- nivorous Insect, the Canal is short, and the Stomach Musculur. In the locust, which feeds upon Vegetables, the Canal is long and complicated, the Stomach Mem- branous, and there is a true Gizzard. In some the Sto- mach is single, ill some double, in others manifold. The greater number of Insects have a single Stomach, which is sometimes Membranous, sometimes Muscular, at other times there is no perceptible dilatation. The Stomach of the Bee is a Membranous Bag, in which the Nectar of the Flowers is converted into \ * Honey, which it afterwards vomits, and deposites in the Hive. In several instances, the Esophagus and J&cctum are surrounded by a turn of the Spinal Mar- row. The Mesentery is wanting in Insects. The Stomach, in the Larva, commonly differs from that of the perfect Insect. In the former, it is for the most part of great size; while in the latter, which take* litttle nourishment, it is remarkably small. Some In- sects, as the Grasshopper, Cricket, &c. which have a plurality of Stomachs, have the power of throwing the Food to the Mouth to be chewed again, and are there- fore sometimes termed Ruminating Insects. The Anus, in Insects, not only affords a passage for the Faeces, but incloses the extremities of the Parts of Generation.

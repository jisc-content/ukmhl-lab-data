This and the other four-footed Reptiles have two BonCs in the Fore-Arm, though the division into two is not very distinct. - In the Tortoise, the Feet are proportionally small, in consequence of which the Animal is observed to he slow in its motions. There are three Ranges of Bones in the Carpus, the pieces varying in number in the different ranges.

The Frog and Toad have no motion in the tipper Jaw, and they are destitute' of real Teeth, though they have pointed Bodies serving as a substitute, and placed in the Palate ; the Frog has them also in the Upper Jaw.

The Dorsal Vertebras have broad Transverse Pro- cesses, that may somewhat supply the place of Ribs, which are wanting here. The Os Sacrum consists of one Ion- Bone.

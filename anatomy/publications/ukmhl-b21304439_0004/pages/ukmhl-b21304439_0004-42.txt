45 OF THE BONES [Part I. The this Bone is that of the Duck-bill appearance which it has in the Ornithorrynchus. Os Hyoides. The Os Hyoides has the same parts in general as in Man. It can be divided into Body and Cornua; but in many Animals, the long Cornua are so united with the Body, as not to be distinguished from it. Those corresponding to the small Appendices in Man are here larger than the other Cornua, and, being articulated be- fore them, arc distinguished by the name of Anterior, the other being called the Posterior. The first are fixed, on each side, to the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone, or to a slender Bone supplying its place. In the Ourang-oulang, the Os Hyoides is nearly as in Man. It varies in the other Apes. In the Carni- vora, it is generally long and slender. In the Solipccls, the Posterior Cornua and Body form an Arch, from which a long Process descends; the Anterior Cornua are short, and arc directed forward to be articulated with the Styloid Processes. In Ruminants, the Posterior Cornua unite with the Body into an Arch, which has a Tuberosity in the middle of its inferior part; the Anterior Cornua have each two pieces of unequal length, the short one being articulated with the Styloid Process. In Amphibious Quadrupeds, as the Seal, the Body of the Os Plyoides is slender ; the Posterior Cornua are continued in an Arch with the Body ; the Anterior are formed of three Bones.

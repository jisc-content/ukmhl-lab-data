186 URINARY AND MALE ORGANS [Part I. in every Genus. In some, as the Ape tribe and Horse, it is dilated somewhat, as in the Human Species. In others, as the Boar, and many Ruminants, it is conical and pointed, and in some turned to one side. Many others, as the Carnivora, have it also conical, but with the addition of the Os Penis, which commonly projects to the extremity of the Gians. In the Elephant, it is cylindrical like the Penis, and then contracts at the ex- tremity. In many, the Gians has a Tendinous appearance.

O In the Badger, Dog, &c. or such as have the copula- tion tedious, there is a double Gians, or two Cavernous Prominences, one in the Eody of the Penis, the other near its extremity. Behind the Prominences are two Veins, which are compressed by Muscles in the time of coition ; in consequence of which, the return of the Blood is prevented, and the double Gians kept in a state of distension. Something of a similar nature is produced at this time in the Female ; the Vagina and its Corpus Cavernosum are contracted, by which the Animals are held together, and often, contrary to their inclination, till the Semen is evacuated, and the parts relaxed. In the Opossums, the Gians is divided into two parts, each of which is perforated for the transmission of the Semen. At the division of the Gians, is the passage for the Urine. In the Echidna and the Ornithorrynchus Paradoxus, the

[PartV such strength, that the Animal masticates other Testa- cea, upon which it lives, The Anus, in the Mollusca, varies considerably in situation among the different Ge- nera or Species. In the Cuttle-Fish, it is at the fore » part of the Neck; in the Slug and Snail, close to the Air-hole ; in the Limpet, it is upon the top of the Head ; and in the Aeephala in general, opposed to the Mouth. The Liver, in the different Mollusca, is commonly large in proportion ; it has no Vena Portae ; it receives its Blood from the Aorta, and returns it by Veins to the Cava. In the Cephalopoda, the Liver is a brown mass, situated near the Head, and extending into the Abdomen. In the Sepia Loligo, the Bag which pro- duces the ink is situated on the Liver, and sends out a’ Duct, which terminates near the end of the Rectum. In the Sepia Officinalis, the Ink-bag js situated between the Lobes of the Liver, and in the Sepia Octopus, at a distance from them. In these Animals, according to Cuviek, the Liver sends Bile of an orange colour, by two Ducts, into the Gizzard. The contents of the Ink- bag arc supposed to be discharged by the action of the large Muscular Sheath of the Body of the A nimal, and serve to render the surrounding element bitter, when the Creature is in danger of being attacked by an ene- my. The Gasteropoda have a large Liver, divided into Lobes, which send out a number of Ducts that sur- round the Alimentary Canal, and terminate in the In- testines. In the Slug, the transparent Blood-vessels form a border, which is conspicuous on the dafk-co- loured Liver. In many of the Snail kind, the Livery with

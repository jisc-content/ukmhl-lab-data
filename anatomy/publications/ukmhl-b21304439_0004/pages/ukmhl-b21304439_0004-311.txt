Part IV.] 311 OF FISHES. and supplying the place of the convexity of this part of the Eye. In some Fishes, as the Skate and Shark tribe, the Eye rests upon a stalk of Cartilage, or expands behind into a kind of Tubercle, which allows the Muscles to act with more advantage upon it. In other Fishes, it rests upon Gelatinous Matter.in form of a Cone, contained in loose Cellular Substance. Fishes are destitute of Eye-lids ; but, to defend this Organ from injury, the Tunica Adnata is stronger than in Mammalia and Pi ids, and passes immediately over it without forming any doubling. It may be separated readily from the Tunica Sclerotica and the Cornea. Upon the inner,or back part of the Cornea is a delicate Membrane, termed Tunica Aquea, which incloses the Aqueous Humour at the fore part of the Eye ; this can also be easily separated. In some, as the Eel, the Tunica Adnata allows the Cornea to move behind it, in the manner it does in Serpents, Src. The Cornea is not so firmly connected to the Sclero- tic as in Mammalia; iL is easily separated from the Sclerotis, which appears then open at the fore part of the Iris. Most Osseous Fishes, as the Salmon, Mackerel, &c. have, at each corner of the Orbit, a Vertical Veil, which covers a small part of the Eye. The Tunica Sclerotica is Cartilaginous', semi-trans- parent, and lined with a delicate Membrane, which is commonly of a black colour. Fishes have no Tapetum on the Choroid Coat, the U 4 inner

1G2 fPART I. OF THE INTESTINES The Colon, furnished with a circular Valve, is small and short, as in other Carnivora, and, without making any circuitous turn, goes directly across the Abdomen to form the Rectum. The Cat has the great Intestines considerably dilated, hut the Caecum is remarkably short. Of the Amphibious Mammalia, the Seal has the Colon about double the size of the small Intestines, and the Caecum is short and rounded. In the Manatus, or Sea C07C, the Intestines are scarcely six times the length of the Body, though the Animal is of the Herbivorous kind. Solipeds have a much shorter Canal than the other Hcrbivora, but the great Intestines are enormously di- lated. The Colon begins by a Cul-de-Sac, and its Ca- vity is divided into Cells by three strong Muscular Bands. The Caecum is of a conical form, and so large as to equal the size of the Stomach. Pecora, of all other Quadrupeds, have in general the Canal of greatest length, and the liam has the longest ot anv. A great part of the Intestines, in this order, form concentric turns, and there is little difference with respect to their size. The Duodenum is large, and forms a kind of Pouch; but the Colon and Caecum arc of mo- derate bulk. They are uniform on their surface, and have no Ligaments tacking them up into Cells. Of the order Belluce.â€”In the Hog, the small Intes- tines are united, and have conspicuous Papillae. The Caecum and Colon arc of considerable size. In the jElephant, the Canal is short, but very large. The small

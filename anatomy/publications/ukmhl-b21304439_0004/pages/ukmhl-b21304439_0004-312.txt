312 [Part IV. OF THE EYE inner Layer of which, or Tunica Ruyschiana, is black, but in the Skate, Shark, &c. the bottom of the Eve is of a silver colour, from the Choroid Coat appearing through its inner lining, which is here transparent. The outer Layer of the Choroidcs, or proper Cho- roid Coat, is white or argent, and Vascular. From the inner Layer, a Vascular Funnel-shaped Membrane arises, the Campanula of Haller, which goes to the Lens, and has been considered as analogous to the Mar- supium of Birds. Between the two Layers of the Choroid Coat, in the Osseous Fishes, but not in the Skate and Shark kind, there is a Body, termed Corpus Glundulosum, or Glati- dula Chproidca, of a brilliant red colour. It is in form of a Horse-shoe, oiy in some, approaches to a circle. It is considered either as Muscular, and serving to make the Eye accommodate itself to objects at different dis- tances, or Glandular, and secreting some of the Hu- mours. The Corpus Ciliare is indistinct, and Ciliary Pro- cesses are generally wanting in Fishes. 'I he Iris is intimately connected with the (horoid Coat, and possesses brilliant colours in different Fishes. In the Skate, the upper part of the Iris has a palmated Process or Curtain, termed Operculum Pupillare, which ihe Animal occasionally lets down to cover the Pupil. Of the Humours of the Eye, the Aqueous is so small in quantity, as to be seen with difficulty, the deficiency being supplied by a spherical Lens, and the denser ele- ment in which the Animal lives. J he Lens is, besides, 'observed to be not only rounder, but also more dense than

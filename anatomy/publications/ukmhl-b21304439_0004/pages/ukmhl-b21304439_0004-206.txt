I he Neck is furnished with a number of Muscles, corresponding with the number of the Cervical Vertebrae. The Tail has Muscles for raising, depressing, and turning it to either side. They arise chiefly from the posterior part of the Trunk of the Body, and are fixed to the Os Coccygis. The Lateral Muscles in particular, acting together, expand the feathers in the Tail, so as to pro- duce that beautiful fan-like appearance, so remarkable in the Turkey, Peacock, and Pheasant. Of the Muscles of the Ribs, the Scalenus is analo- gous to the Levatores Costarum, which extend from the transverse processes of the Vertebrae, to the anterior edges of the Ribs. The Intercostales and Triangu- lares bear a considerable resemblance to those in Man. Birds have no Diaphragm. There are three Layers of Abdominal Muscles, the two outer of which run more in a transverse direction than in the Human Species. The Recti and Pyramidales are wanting.

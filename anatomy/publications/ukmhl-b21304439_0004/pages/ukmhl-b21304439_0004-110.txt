OF THE NOSE [Part f. 110 Ferae,, as the Zion, there is only a double roll some- th ng 1 ke that in Pecora. ( m til ages. 1 lie Cartilages of the Nose vary con- siderably in different Quadrupeds. Those in the Ape tribe differ from the analogous parts in Man chiefly in their diminutive size. The Muscles affecting the Nose, in these Animals, appear to be part of the Panniculus Carnosus. In Carnivorous Animals, as the Dog', in which the Nose does not project beyond the Mouth, the Carti- lages also bear a considerable resemblance to those in the Human Species. In Carnivorous Animals with move- able Snouts, as the Mole and Rear, the Cartilages form a complete Tube, which is connected to the edge of the Osseous part of the Nose. I he Snout ol the Hog bears a considerable resem- blance to that of the Mole, but its Cartilages are shorter in proportion. The Nose of Carnivorous Animals has distinct lono-i_ â€¢ & tudinal Muscles, the ends of which, and the Snout it- self, are covered with circular Fibres, continued from the Orbicular Muscles of the Lips, as already observed. In Solipeds and Ruminants, the Osseous Nares are large, and have a Notch in their lateral parts. The soft portion of the Nose, connected to the Bones, forms the Nostrils, strictly so called, the edges of which, in the Horse, inclose a Cartilage, called Semilunar. The rest of the external part is merely a fold of the Skin, and forms a Cavity termed False Naris, which has the same common opening with the Nostril. The Muscles of the Nose are noticed in a former part of the Volume. The Pituitary Membrane agrees in its general struc- ture

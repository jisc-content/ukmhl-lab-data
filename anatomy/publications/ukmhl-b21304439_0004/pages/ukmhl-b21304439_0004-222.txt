OF THE EAR 222 [Pakt IT. OF THE EAlt. There is no Cartilaginous External Ear in any of the class, but. instead of it, especially in Rapacious Birds, there is a Tuft of Feathers regularly arranged round the External Meatus, which excludes dust, insects, &c. but allows sound to enter readilv. a/ In the Oiel kind, and several others, chiefly Birds of prey, there is a Merribrano-muscular Valve over the pas- sage, which has been compared to the Concha of the Human Ear. The edges of this have a number of slen- der Feathers placed in a circle, which gives a singular appearance to the Animal. The Meatus Externus is little else than a simple hole in the surface of the Scull. It has a liquor secreted in it, which may answer the same purpose as the wax of the Ear of Mammalia. The Mcmbrana Tympani, contrary to what happens in the former class, is convex outwardly, and of an oval form, with the long diameter placed downwards and forwards. The Tympanum is of considerable size, and has with- in it only one Ossiculum Auditus, which is rather of a Cartilaginous consistence, and termed from its shape. It is composed of two Branches, which form, a kind of Elbow. One is attached along the infe- rior half of the Membrana Tympani, the other goes from the superior part of the former, at the middle of the Membrana Tympani, and divides into slender Crura,

In the Ape tribe, there are scarcely any Mastoid Cells to communicate with the Tympanum, the Pro- cess containing these in the Human Body, being in this race of Animals almost obliterated ; but, in place of Mastoid Cells, there are others which extend a consi- derable way into the Temporal Bone. In the greater part ol digitated Mammalia, instead of a Mastoid Process, there is a Bony Organ, commu- nicating with the proper Tympanum, which, in the greater part of the Glires and Carnivora, forms a large Cavity, or Bulla Ossea, that makes the principal part of the Tympanum. This, in the Dog, Cat, Lion, Ti- ger, &c. is globose; in Ruminants, it is angular; in the Bear, it is wanting. In the Solipeds, Ruminants, Pigs, &c. the Cavity is divided into Cells, and there is behind this a long Process, like the Mastoid, or in some like the Styloid, but belonging to the Occipital Bone. In some Animals, as the Indian Hog, Marmot, and Porcupine, the walls of the Tympanum shew vestiges of Cells; but the Cellular appearance is more distinct in the Elephant, where this Cavity is of great size. The Tympanum, with its Bulla Ossea, in the Ceta- cea, is formed of a Bony Lamina, rolled on itself like a Concha; but there is no spiral Cavity in it, the sub- stance being quite solid and hard like a rock. This lias been frequently mistaken for the Labyrinth in these Animals. The Internal Parts of the Ear, in the Whale tribe,

OF TIIE LARYNX, &c. [Part I. 140 are connected by a cross Slip ; in others they are at a distance from each other, and without any connexion. In the Cctacca Mu Hunter did not find the Thyroid Gland. Cuvier, however, detected it in the Dolphin, where it was divided into two portions, which were at a distance from the Larynx, and near the anterior ex- tremity of the Sternum. Trachea.—This presents, in general, the same struct ture as in the Human Body ; but the number of the Bronchi varies with that ot the Lobes of the Lungs. There is great variety in the number, form, and ex- tent of the Cartilaginous Rings of the Trachea. They approach nearer to a circle in Quadrupeds than in Man; the opening behind, therefore, is proportionally smaller. Many of the Glires have rings almost complete. In some of the Ferae, as the Bear, Lion, &c. they form about three-fourths of a circle. Among other Animals, as the Ox, the extremities of the Cartilages meet behind in an acute angle. In a few, as the Lama, Seal, Lamantin, Dolphin, and Porpoise, the Cartilages of the Trachea, and of the beginnings of the Bronchi, are observed to form a com- plete circle. / • OF

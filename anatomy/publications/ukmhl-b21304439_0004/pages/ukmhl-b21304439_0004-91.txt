OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 91 Spinal Marrow and Vertebral Nerves. Th Spinal Marrow is covered by the same Mem- branes, and divided into two Lateral Cords in the same manner, as in the Human Body. The division into two Lateral Portions is still more distinctly marked than in Man. The number of the Nerves coming off from the Spinal Marrow is equal to that of the holes between the Vertebrae ; and they arise in a similar manner as in the Human Subject. The Cervical Nerves are seven in number on each side in Mammalia in general, besides the Occipital and Accessory Nerves. The size and extent of the Branches of these Nerves vary according to the nature of the parts which they supply. The Brachial Plexus is produced by the three last Nerves of the Neck, and first of the Back. hey consist, as in Man, of a num- ber of large Trunks, variously disposed, according to the shape and size of the anterior extremity. The Dia- phragmatic Nerve is quite similar to that in Man. The Dorsal and Lumbar differ only in number from those in the Human Body, and they may be known by attending to the number of the Vertebrae. Of the Pelvic and Caudal Nerves, the former is as in Man, the latter go from the Vertebral Canal, by the Foramina between the first pieces of the Caudal \ erte- brae, to be dispersed upon parts at the root of the Tail, and upon the continuation of that substance. The Nerves of the Posterior or Abdominal Extremi- ties form a Plexus, of which the Cords, and their dis- tribution, are nearly as in the Human Species. OF \ 1

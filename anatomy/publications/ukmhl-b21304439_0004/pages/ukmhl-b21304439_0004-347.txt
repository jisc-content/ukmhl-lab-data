In the former there are two pairs, each having a Duct, which unites with its fellow, and opens into the Mouth near the Tongue ; the latter have commonly but one pair, which lies near the Mouth. Circulating System.â€”In the Cephalopoda, the Circu- lating Organs are more complicated than in other Ani- mals. In the Cuttle-Fish, there are three Hearts, two Pulmonary, and one Aortic. Each of the Pulmonary Hearts consists of an Auricle and Ventricle. The Aortic Heart has only a Ventricle. There are two Pulmonary Arteries, one on each Gill, and the same number of corresponding Veins; an anterior and a posterior Aor- ta ; and an anterior and two posterior Venae Cavae. At the openings of the Veins into the Hearts, of the Auricles into the Ventricles, and of these into the Ar- teries, Valves are placed to prevent the retrograde di- rection of the Blood. The Ventricles have also ColumT nas Carneae, as in the former classes of Animals. The anterior Cava separates behind into two parts? each of which receives a posterior Cava, and terminates in an Auricle. Where the Veins meet at the Pulmona- ry Hearts, there is an intricate net-work of Column* Carneae and Foveas. The Auricle opens into the Ven- tricle, which is placed at the root of a corresponding Gill. From the Ventricle the Branchia1 Artery is sent put, which runs along one side of the Gill, while the Vein

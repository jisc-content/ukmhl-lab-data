The form and relative size of the Epididymis varies much in different Animals. In most Mammalia, it is „ fixed to the Testicle, as in Man ; but in many of the Glires, as the Rat, and in Animals with a Pouch, it is connected to the Testicle only by two thin Cords. 'J he Vasa Deferentia, as in Man, are thick and firm, but thinner when the Testes lie constantly in the Ab- domen. As in the Human Species, also, the Vasa Deferentia, in many Animals, are enlarged, and are Cellular internally, for some space previous to their termination. The Cells, in the Horse, and also in the Ram, have small orifices internally, from which a thick white fluid can be pressed into them. In the Elephant, the dilatation is of a Globular form. Most Mammalia possess Vesiculcc Seminales, which, in many, as in some Apes, but particularly in the Hedge-hoare greatly enlarged, like the Testicle, when these Animals are in season. The Vesicuke exist in Apes, in Bats, in the Glires, in the Hedge-liog and Ra- coon, in Solipeds, and in the Belluce. They are wanting in the Ornithorrynchus, in Car- nivora, in Ruminants, unless two small Glandular Cap- sules, considered by some as Prostate Glands, be taken for such,—and in the Cetacea. There is no rule yet known with respect to the presence or the absence of these. Their form and structure vary exceedingly in differ- ent Mammalia. They are commonly Membranous and Cellular, but in many cases they have a Glandular M 2 appearance

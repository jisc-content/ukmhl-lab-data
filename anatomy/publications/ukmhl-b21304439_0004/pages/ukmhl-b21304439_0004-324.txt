304, OF THE HEART, &c. [Part IV. In the Skate kind, the Absorbents are proportionally much larger, compared with their Blood-vessels, than in the former classes. They have frequent communications with each other, and often by transverse Canals; but in place ol form- ing Thoracic Ducts, they unite into Right and Left Plexus, which go to the corresponding sides of the Body. The principal Absorbents of the Chylopoietic Viscera run near the large Branches of the Ccehac and Mesen- teric Blood-vessels, and the principal Lymphatics of the Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera attend the larger V es- sels belonging to these parts. Besides the Plexus which these form, there is one of a singular nature on theCurvature of the Stomach ; it has a Cellular or Cavernous appearance, which does not occur in any other part ol the Body. Into the Visceral Plexus all the other Absorbents of the Body pass; the Lymphatics of the inferior parts, and of the Organs of Urine and Generation, run up to them. Those of the Trunk go inwards, and those ol the Head, Heart, and Gills, form chiefly a single Trunk, which descends. From these Plexus, a Trunk in each side ol the Body ends in the Subclavian Vein at the joining \'ith the Internal Jugular, where the fluids are prevented from returning by a pair of \ alves. In the Cod, Salmon, and other Osseous Fishes, there are live principal Vessels, which are more conspicuous than the rest; one runs directly along the middle o the Belly, from the Anus to the Head, and receives the Lvmphatics from the parts of the Body near it; another â€˜ along;

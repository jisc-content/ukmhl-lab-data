Or THE BRAIN, fee. [Part IV. 310 at each side of the Tail, of which they form about two inferior thirds of the thickness, the Caudal Muscles composing the principal parts of the remaining third. Each of the Columns is intercepted by a great number of Laminae, forming the whole into so many Cells, which are here of a rhomboidal form. They receive their principal Nerves from the Spinal Marrow ; some of less consideration coming from the Sympathetic Pair. Of the Silurus, the Organ covers the greater part of the Body. It begins at the Head, and extends to near the Tail, and forms a thick Stratum anteriorly, but be- comes thinner as it approaches the Caudal extremity. It receives its Nerves from those portions of the Eighth Pair which extend, in other Fishes, along the lateral parts of the Body ; but these are much smaller in proportion than in the Torpedo. . OF THE EYE. The Eye of the Animals of this class is proportionally larger than in the two former, that of the Cod greatly exceeding the size of the Human Eye. In Fishes, as in the Cetacea, while the posterior part of the Ball is convex, the anterior is quite flat, the water in which they live refracting the rays of light, and

In many Animals, each Vas Deferens unites with the Vesicula of its side; in others, the Vasa De- ferentia and Ducts from the Vesicula? terminate by a common opening in the Verumontanum. In the Ape tribe, the appearance of the Vesiculae Se- minales is nearly the same as in the Human Body. In most of the Glires they are remarkable for their great size. Hie Vesiculae of the Squirrel are particu- lar, in being placed upon the inner side of the Vasa Deferentia. In the Rat, they are so large as to be partly without the Pelvis. The Guinea Pig has them of a long cylindrical form, and containing a cheesy-like substance. In the Hare, their place is sup- plied by a rectangular Sac, which has in one part a Glandular appearance, and opens into the Verumonta- lium along with the Vas Deferens. In the Hedge-hog, they exceed the size of the Testes, forming on each side four or five Fasciculi, each of which is composed of a Tube wonderfully convoluted. The different Tubes join into one Canal, that opens into the Veru- montanum along with the Vas Deterens. In the Horse, Boar, Elephant, and Rhinoceros, the Vesiculae are of oreat size, and form on each side a common Duct with the Vas Deferens.

They terminate by one or more Excretory Ducts, ki common with the Vesiculae Seminales and A asa De- ferentia,

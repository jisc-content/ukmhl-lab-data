TO OF THE MUSCLES [Part I. In Ruminants, this Muscle extends the Outer r,Toej and the Extensor Jndicis the Inner Toe. The Extensor Indicis Proprius, or Indicator, in Mqnkeys, sends a Tendon to the fore, and another to the middle Finger. In Dogs and Cats, it is situated as in Man. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is wanting. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis is similar, in Apes and many other clawed Animals, to that in Alan. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is fixed to the base of the Metacarpal Bone, and forms the Oblique Extensor of the Canon Bone. The Extensor Primi Internodii is present in Apes, Dogs, Cats, &c. The Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis is indistinct in Apes, and wanting in the Dog, Cat, &c. In Solipeds and Ruminants, the two last- named Muscles are wanting. The Flexors of the Thumb, in clawed Quadrupeds, are somewhat similar to those in Alan. In Ruminants, the Flexor Sublimis and Flexor Profundus of the Fin- gers send each two Tendons to the Toes. In Solipeds, there are two similar Aluscles, but only a single Tendon to each, the one also perforating the other. MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR EXTRE- MITIES. Muscles of the Thigh.—In the generality of Quadru- peds, the Gluteus Aledius and Minimus are large. In the Horse, the Muscle corresponding to the Alaxi- mus in Man is the smallest of the three, and is almost • J A ** Aponeurotic.

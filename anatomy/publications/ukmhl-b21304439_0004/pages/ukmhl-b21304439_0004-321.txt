OF FISHES. 321 Pabt IV.] I Frogs, consists of a single Auricle and a Ventricle, which correspond with the right side of the Heart of warm-blooded Animals. The Auricle is commonly larger than the Ventricle, but thinner in its walls. It receives the Blood from the Body, and sends it to the Ventricle, in the Mouth of which there are Valves, which vary in number in different Fishes. The Ventricle is sometimes round, at other times triangular, but more frequently of a tetragonal form. Its sides are generally thick, and have Columnae Carneae running in different directions. It opens first into a Bulb or Pedicle, which is very conspicuous in the Cod and Salmon, where it is of a pyramidal form. In the Skate, it has a cylindrical appearance. In this Animal and the Sturgeon, there are Valves at the entry, and also at the further extre- mity Lof the Pedicle. In the Cod, Salmon, &c. the Valves are only at its origin. Principal Blood-vessels.â€”The distribution of the Blood-vessels differs considerably from that of the Animals of the preceding classes. They have a smaller proportion of red, but a much greater number of colourless Vessels. The Branchial Artery is conti- nued from the Pedicle, and is entirely spent upon the Gills. In the Skate, it advances under the Car- tilage which unites the inferior extremities of the Branchial Arches, and soon gives off a Branch to each side, that subdivides into three others, to be dispersed upon a corresponding number of Posterior Branchiae. The Trunk afterwards proceeds till it gets opposite to the two Anterior Branchiae, and then divides into a ^ ol. IV. X couple

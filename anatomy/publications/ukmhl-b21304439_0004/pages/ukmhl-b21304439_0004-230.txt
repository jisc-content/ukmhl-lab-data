230 OF THE HEART, 8zc. [Part II. The Radial is proportionally small; the Ulnar very large, runs along the external edge of the Wing. The Posterior Aorta sends off the Cceliac to the Sto- mach, Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, and part of the Intes- tines ; then the two Mesenteries. It gives also the Spcr- â– matics to the Testes and Ovaria, and Anterior Lobes of the Kidneys ; the Intercostals and Lumbars to the con- taining parts of the Body ; continued farther, it fur- nishes Branches to the Kidneys and Pelvis, and at last to the Inferior Extremities. The Veins correspond with those in Mammalia; but there are two anterior Cava?, both opening into the up- per part of the Auricle. In the larger Birds, as the Ostrich, Muscular Fibres are seen in the Cavae, particularly in the posterior one. In Diving Birds, the Cava Posterior dilates at the Liver into a sort of Reservoir, somewhat similar to that in the Seal. f OF THE ABSORBENT SYSTEM. Till of late years, Anatomists have been unacquaint- ed with the Absorbents of Birds, chiefly owing to the transparency of the Chyle, and the want of Mesenteiic Glands. The Lymphatics are now demonstrated in Birds, as well as in Man and Quadrupeds, and the struc- ture

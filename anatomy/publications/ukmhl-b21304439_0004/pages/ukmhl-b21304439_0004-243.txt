From the end of the Ilium, and also from the Cmca, "hen piesent, the Colon is sent off, winch is proportion- ally short, and differs from that in many of the Indivi- duals of the former class, in not being formed into Cells. In the Ostrich, however, the Colon, as it advances, becomes tacked up into Cells, and gradually increases in diameter, contrary to what happens in other. Animals.

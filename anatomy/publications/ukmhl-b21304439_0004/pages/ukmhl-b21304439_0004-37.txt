Part I.] 37 OF MAMMALIA. BONES OF THE HEAD. Cranium.—Next to the Human Species, the Ape tribe is found to have the largest Cranium in proportion to the Face; but the Cranium is small here when compared with that of the Human Body. While, in a European Man, the Area of a longitudinal vertical section of the Cranium is almost four times larger than that of the Face, (the Lower Jaw excluded) ; in the Monkey it is little more than double. In most of the Fera; it is nearly equal. The Glires, Solipcds, Pecora, and Bel- luce, have it less. It is only about a half in Pecora, and little more than a fourth in the Horse; and in propor- tion as the Cranium becomes less than the Face, the Animal is observed to become more stupid or ferocious ; though to this rule there are many exceptions. The Facial Angle assists likewise in discovering the proportion between the Cranium and Face. It is more obtuse in the Human Species, and more acute as we descend in the scale from Man, till in the lower classes of Vertebral Animals it disappears. In the Human Adult European, the angle is 85° ; in the Ourang-out- ang 67w ; in some of the other Monkeys, it goes as low as 110° ; and among the other Genera of Quadrupeds, it is in some only 20°. The Temporal and Occipital Ridges, or Cristas, vary considerably in different Quadrupeds. They serve chiefly for the attachment of the strong Temporal and Cervical Muscles attached to them, and are most con- C 3 siderable

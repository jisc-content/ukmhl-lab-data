Fart I.] OF MAMMALIA. 393 surface of the Ovum is effected, in Mammalia, in three different ways. 1. In some, as in the Mare and Sow, the whole ex- ternal surface of the Ovum adheres to the Uterus firm- ly, or a bag-like Placenta is formed. 2. There is a simple Placenta, Orbicular in some, as in the Ape tribe and most of the digitated Mammalia, or forming a Zone or Belt, as in the Dog and Cat kind, &c. In several of the digitated Mammalia, the external surface of the Placenta has a white Glandular-like Body, or Corpus Glandulosum, inclosed in it, which admits of tile easier separation of parts towards the latter period of Gestation. 3. A third kind of connection is found in Ruminants, where there are numerous Placentulce, or Cotyledons, upon the surface of the Ovum. These adhere to Glands, produced from the inner side of the Uterus. The Glandulae Uterinas have many Papillae and Ca- verns, corresponding to Caverns and Papillse or Pro- cesses of the Placentulae. They are very Vascular, and possess a milky-like Liquor, which can be readily squeezed out from them; but no injection can be made to pass from the Vessels of the Placentulae to those of the Glandulae. The Cotyledons and Glandulae adhere to each other, the former inclosing the latter, from which comes their name; but they can be readily separated from each other at the latter period of gestation. The Cotyledons are discharged with the After-birth, the Glandulae gradually diminishing in size after the contents of the Uterus have come away, but exist in the Uterus both in the gravid and unimpregnated state.

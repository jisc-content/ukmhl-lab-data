IIS OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Part I. Â« and in the Dog, appears little more than a prolongation of the Maxillary. The Amphibious Quadrupeds which are of the Car- nivorous kind, have the Salivary Glands proportionally very small. In the Seal, as already noticed, there are no Parotids nor Sublinguals ; but there are two Maxil- laries, a great and a small, the common Duct of which opens in the ordinary place. In Solipeds, the Salivary Glands are of great size, and have a lobulated appearance. In the Horse, the Parotids are very large, and, extending above and behind the Concha, go beyond the angle of the Jaw; the Duct runs by the under part of the Masseter, and opens upon a Papilla opposite to the Fourth Molaris of the Upper Jaw. The Maxillary Gland extends along the side of the Larynx and Pharynx, having also a Papilla where the Duct opens at the side of the Fraenum Linguae. The Sublingual Gland opens by many small orifices arranged along the under part of the side of the Tongue. In Ruminants, also, the Salivary Glands are of great size. In the Ox and Sheep, the Parotid Duct passes by the inferior part of the Masseter, and perforates the Cheek opposite to the second and third Superior Mo- lares. The Maxillary is remarkably long here, and extends, as in the Horse, along the Larynx and Pharynx, hav- ing a Papillary Valve at its termination. The Sublin- gual is very long in these Animals, has a single Duct which /

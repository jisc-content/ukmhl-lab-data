In the Cetacea, the connecting medium is so soft, that the parts can be rea- dily removed from each other. In the order Glires or Rodentla, the Temporal Bone has no Carotic Canal, the Artery entering between the Temporal and Sphenoid Bones. There is a considerable variety, also, among the other Foramina at the base ot the Cranium; those of the Cribriform Plate of the Eth- moid Bone being, in number and size, in proportion to the acuteness of smell. In the Cetacea, the Cribriform Plate of this Bone is wanting. The three large Fossae at the inside ot the Base ot the Cranium in Quadrupeds, are more superficial as the Animal is removed from Man. In many Carnivorous Animals, the Cavity for the Cerebellum is separated from that of the Cerebrum by a broad Osseous Lami- na, projecting from the inner side of the Cranium. The Scull of the Elephant presents a remarkable ap- pearance ; the two Tables are separated from each other to a considerable distance, and the space is occupied by numerous Osseous Plates, that form large Cells, com- municating with each other, and then with the Eusta- chian Tube, which leads into the Throat. These Cells are filled with air, which, without adding to the weight of the Head, allows it to be increased in size, for the attachment of the strong Muscles necessary for the mo- tion of the Lower Jaw and Proboscis. In the Cetacea, .the Scull is very globular, and the C 4 . Face

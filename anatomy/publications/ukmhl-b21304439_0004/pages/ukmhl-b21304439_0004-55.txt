Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 55 fin Bone has a piece connected to it, under the name oi Shuttle Bone. The Elephant has five perfect Toes, but they are al- most entirely concealed by the Skin of the Foot. In the web-footed Quadrupeds, as the Otter and Seal, and in the Pectoral Fins of the Cetacea, the Bones analogous to those of the Hand, are in a flattened form, and, in the latter kind of Animals, are often in a state of Cartilage. The Anterior Extremities of the Seal, &c. form a sort of medium between those of other Mam- malia and the Cetacea, being more confined than the former, but less so than the latter. POSTERIOR EXTREMITIES. Os Femoris.â€”In every class of Animals, the Os Fe- moris, like the Os Humeri, is single. It varies in length according to that of the Metatarsus. In most Quadru- peds it is so short, that it scarcely projects beyond the Abdomen, in consequence of which the Leg, properly so called, is commonly termed the Tlngh. The Cervix of the Thigh-bone here is remarkably short, but the Great Trochanter rises considerably a- bove the head of the Bone. In some Animals, as the Horse, there is an Unciform Process. This, in the Rhinoceros, forms, with the Trochanter Major, a Fo- ramen between them and the body of the Bone. The Leg Bones are nearly as in Man, but the Tibia, in general, is considerably longer than the Os Femoris. In the Ape tribe, they are more nearly equal. In some D 4 of

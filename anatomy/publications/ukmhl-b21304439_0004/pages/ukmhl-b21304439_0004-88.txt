OF THE BRAIN 88 [Part I. In the Horse, Ox, Sheep, &c. the third Ventricle forms a sort of circular passage, which surrounds the Commissura Mollis of the Optic Thalami. The fourth Ventricle has nothing remarkable about it; the Arbor Vitas, in the substance of the Cerebellum, lias a consi- derable resemblance to that in the Human Brain. The Tubercula Quadrigemina are larger, hence bet- ter named Nates and Testes in the Quadruped, espe- cially in Herbivora, than in Man, though they are more nearly of the same size in the Ape. The Nates are Cortical, and the Testes Medullary externally, as in Man. In Carnivorous Animals, the Testes are gene- rally larger than the Nates. In the Dolphin, they are triple the size. In Herbivora, the Nates, on the con- * 4 trary, are much larger than the Testes, and are of a round form. The Pineal Gland, in Quadrupeds, is si- milar to that in Man, but is generally more conical and pointed. The Acervulus Cerebri, so frequently occur- ring in, or near, the Pineal Gland in the Human Brain, is seldom met with here. It has been seen in some of the Pecora, as the Fallow Deer and Goat. The inequalities at the Base of the Brain are much less considerable than in Man. The Tuber Annulare is less prominent. In Carnivora, there are two Cor- pora Albicantia; in Herbivora, there is only one of these r bodies. The Corpora Pyramidalia are considerably longer than in the Human Species. Or

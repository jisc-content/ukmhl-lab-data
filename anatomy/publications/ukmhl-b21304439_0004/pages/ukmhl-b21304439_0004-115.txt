In some Animals, as the Ant-eater, Armadillo, and Orni- thomjnchus, the Tongue is the longest in all the Mam- malia, for seizing their prey. In the Cetacea, on the contrary, it is almost entirely fixed down to the Jaw; but in Quadrupeds in general, it is nearly as loose as in the Human Body. In some Animals, it serves as an Organ of taste; in others it is also employed for taking in the Food. In most Quadrupeds, it is proportionally longer and narrower than in Man, and possesses the same kind of Papillae, the chief difference being in their form. In the generality of Hcrbivora, especially the Pecora, the Tongue is covered with a firm Cuticle, forming in- numerable sharp-pointed Papillae, directed towards the Throat. These, like so many tenter-hooks, assist in laying hold of the grass, and other kinds of Food, ancf serve, at the same time, to increase the Organ of taste. In some of the Monkey tribe, the Papillae Maximae are fewer in number, and differently disposed from those in Man. In the Ferae, the Tongue differs little from that in the Human Body. In the Cat kind, besides many round and conical Papillae, there is a horny or prickly set covering the Tongue, which render it rougher, and enable it to take a firmer hold of the prey. The Dog has upon the Mouth and root of the longue, many Papillae, placed obliquely backwards, ■which assist in preventing the Food from escaping. There is likewise, in this Animal, a Tendinous Cord, termed Worm, in the under part of the substance of H 2 th«

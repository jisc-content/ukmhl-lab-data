[Part I. OF THE HEART, &c. 134 in the subdivision of its principal Branches, which cor- respond with the number of the Lobes of the Lungs. According to the observations of Cuvier, the sides of the Pulmonary Artery, in the Dolphin and Porpoise, and probably in the other Cetacea, are as thick as those of the Aorta, as if the Pulmonary Circulation here differed from that in other Animals. In a great, number of the individuals of this class, the principal Arteries are quite similar to those in Man the Branches varying in their distribution according to the variety existing in the parts on which they are dis- persed ; but in others the Aorta, as in Solipcds, Rumi- nants, the Hoc;, &c. divides, near its origin, into two Trunks of unequal size. The smaller passes forwards, and sends off the Arteries which, in other Animals, come from the Arch of the Aorta; the other, twice as large as the former, goes backwards, and supplies the place of the Descending Aorta; hence the names of Anterior and Posterior Aorta are applied to these Ar- teries. In some Animals one, and in others two, common Trunks arise from the Anterior Aorta. This Artery sends offâ€™ Vessels corresponding with the Subclavians and Carotids, which, in some Animals, arise as in Man ; in others, they are sent off equally in the two sides. In old Ruminants, and in some other Quadrupeds, as the Hog, two flat Bones are frequently found at the beginning of the Aorta, known by the name of Bone of the Heart. The Posterior Aorta differs from the descending Aorta in

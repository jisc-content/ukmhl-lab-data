I Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES. 385 of the latter- Each Polypus has a Stomach, from which Tubes run into the Stalk which supports all the Polypi; hpre they form a net-work, which occupies the whole of this substance. The Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera, viz. Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas, are entirely wanting in this class.

Sometimes they are observed to be bathed in a milky liquor, which is supposed to be the Semen. The Echinus has five Lobes in the Ovarium or Roe.

In the Asterias, the Ovaria form also five Lobes, one for each Branch of the Body, and these are composed of the Ova, which have a reddish colour. In the Holothuria, there is a collection of slender Tubes, which greatly extend at particular seasons, and are considered as the Ova; but thefe is, besides, near the Anus, numerous white spiral Filaments, but whe- ther belonging: to the Male Sex is uncertain. The Zoophytes properly so called, have no Genera- tive Organs ; they propagate by Buds and Slips, some- thing after the manner of the growth in Branches of Trees. , In the Actinia and Polypi, the young sprout out from any part of the external surface of the Parent.

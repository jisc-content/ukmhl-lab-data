[Part II. 208 OF THE MUSCLES other from the Humerus. There is also an Anconeus. The Supinator Longus is wanting. There is a kind of Supinator Brevis, but it is considered as bending the Fore-arm. Two Muscles occupy the place of the Pro- nator Teres, though seemingly acting as Flexors. The Metacarpus possesses only the motions of adduc- tion and abduction. The Muscles for performing these motions are the following: TheUlnaris Interims, which arises as in Man, and is fixed to the wedge-like Bone of the Carpus; another Muscle lying under this, and sending off a long Fendon, which gives slips to the se- condary Quills, and is inserted to the back ol the Me- tacarpus ; the Ulnar is Externus, which is placed on the posterior surface of the Ulna; its lendon, passing between the last Primary Quill, and first Secondary one, and fixed to the inner edge of the base of the Meta- carpus; a Radial Muscle, which arises by different portions from the External Condyle, and one from the Radius, their common Tendon being fixed to the Tu- bercle of the Metacarpal Bone of the 1 humb. The Digital Muscles, also, can only perform ad- duction and abduction. Of the Adductors or Ex- tensors, there is the Adductor Phalangis Primae, which corresponds with the Flexor Sublimis, arises from the Internal Condyle, and is fixed to the base of the first Bone of the Great Finger. The Ad- ductor Interims Phalangis Secundae, which corresponds with the Flexor Profundus, and goes along the inner side of the Radius, and is inserted into the base of the second Phalanx. The Adductor Follicis, which cor- responds to the Flexor Follicis, is situated between /

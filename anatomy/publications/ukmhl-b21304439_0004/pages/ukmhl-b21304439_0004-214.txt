Claws are wanting in the Wings of Birds, where they could not be used, either for w'alking, or seizing the prey. OF THE BRAIN, <Â§c. The Membranes of the Brain correspond, in number and general appearance, with those of the former class. In some Birds, there is even a Falx, and this, in the Woodcock and Ornithorrynchus, is of an Osseous na- ture. The proportional size of the Brain of the Animals of this class varies extremely ; but it is found, that the Brain of the smaller Birds bears a greater proportion to the size of the Body, than that of the larger kinds. While, in the Sparrow, it is a 25th, and in the Gold finch, a 14th of the weight of their Body ; in thqEagle, it is only a 160th, and in the Goose, a <160th. The Brain consists of two large masses, which form the Hemispheres, the two rl halami Optici, the Cere- bellum, and Medulla Oblongata. The Hemispheres are in form of a Heart, with the base turned backward. There are no Convolutions, nor Corpus Callosum, nor Fornix, nor Septum Lu- , cidum. \

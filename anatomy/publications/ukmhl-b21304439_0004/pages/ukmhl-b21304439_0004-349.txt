349 Part V.] OF MOLLUSCA. have a Cavity in the Neck, which supplies the place of a Lung, and has the Pulmonary Vessels dispersed upon its surface. The Lung, in these Animals, terminates by a small orifice on the surface of the Body, which can be opened or shut at pleasure, and the Lung dilat- • ing or contracting, can admit or expel the air. In the rest of the Gasteropoda, the orifice varies considerably in its situation, being in the back in some, in the breast in others. Some of the Acephalous Mollusca, as the Oyster, have their Lungs in form of Gills, which repre- sent leaves, each with a double Lamina, and a double Series of Vessels. Alimentary Canal.—The Alimentary Canal, in Mol- lusca, consists, as in more perfect Animals, of an Eso- phagus, Stomach, and Intestines, but the beginning and termination of the Canal varies considerably in si- tuation in different individuals. In the Sepia Octopus of the Mollusca Cephalopoda, the Esophagus, having passed the Cartilaginous Ring of the Neck, dilates into first, second, and third Stomachs, which somewhat re- semble those of Granivorous Birds. In the Sepias Offi- cinalis and Loligo, there is only a single Stomach or Gizzard. In the Gasteropoda in general, the Canal is in form of a Funnel; the most simple is in the Slug and Snail. The Stomach, in these, is of considerable size, and the Intestines make a couple of turns in their- course through the Body. In many of the Mollusca, particularly among the Acephala, the Esophagus ex- pands into a Crop, which is covered internally by small Teeth. The Bulla Lignaria contains three Teeth of such

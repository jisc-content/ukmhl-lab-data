In the Silk-worm, the change from the Chrysalis to the Fly happens in ten or more days, according to the season. The Copulation of these Animals is exceed- ingly tedious, the Male heating his Wings upwards of a hundred times before he separates from the Female. The Ova are soon afterwards produced, to the amount of several hundred, through a short Tube from the end of the Abdomen. The Fly dies a few days there- after. * In some Insects, besides Male and Female, there is a third set, termed Neuter, not having the distinguish- ing characters of either sex. They are a kind of Eu- nuchs, or Infertile Animals, and are peculiar to this class. They are found only in those that form into societies, as Bees, 1 Vasps, and Ants. There are no Hermaphrodites among Insects.

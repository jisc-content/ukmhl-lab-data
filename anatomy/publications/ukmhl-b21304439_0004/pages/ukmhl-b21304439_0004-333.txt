OF FISHES. 338 Part IV.] OF THE LIVER, %c. Tiif. Liver, in many of the Animals of this class, is remarkably large in proportion. It lies chiefly in the left side, and in some, as the Skate and Cod, contains a great quantity of Oil, though these Animals, as well as Fishes in general, are destitute of Fat. The Colour is a whitish yellow, or rather grey. It varies in the number of its Lobes, often in different Species of the same Genus, and is extremely tender in its consistence. There is frequently, as in the Lamprey, only one Lobe; sometimes two, as in the Sturgeon ; or two or three, as in the Cod, and here they are of great length. The Skate has three, and these extend to near the posterior extremity of the Abdomen. The situation of the Gall-Bladder is more variable in Fishes than in the Animals of the former classes. In some, it adheres to the surface of the Liver; in others, as the Skate kind, a great part of it is concealed in the substance of this Organ. In some, as the Cod, it is at a distance from it. It is wanting in several Fishes, as the Lamprey, the Lump, and certain Species of Perch. In some it is placed horizontally, in others obliquely, and in some it has a transverse direction. Thc Biliary Ducts, in Fishes, as in Fowls, open sepa- rately into the Intestine, and here also there are distinct â€¢* Hepato-Cystic Ducts. These go commonly in succes- sion

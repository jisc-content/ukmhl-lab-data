Part III.] 277 OF REPTILES. The Ventricles have Cavities small in proportion to their external appearance, owing to the great thickness of their walls. Internally they have, in the three lirst or- ders or tribes, numerous ColumnÂ® Carnes*. In the Turtle kind, there is a strong Pericardium, united to the Peritoneum, in the manner the Diaphragm is united to the Pericardium in the Human Body. The two Auricles are separated by a complete parti- tion. The two Cavae terminate in the Right Auricle, where there are two Valves, and the Pulmonary Veins in the Left, where there are also a pair of Valves. Each Auricle communicates with a corresponding Ven- tricle. The two Ventricles communicate by a large opening. In the Right Ventricle, there is a hollow Muscular Valve, which prevents the return of the Blood to the Left. The Arteries arise from the Right Ventricle only. They come off in three large Trunks, or there are three Aorta?, two of which go to the Abdomen. The Right is the proper Abdominal Aorta; the Left, the Ductus, Communieutivus of Mery ; and Third, the Pulmonary Artery. In consequence of this structure, the Aortic Circula- tion can proceed without interruption while the Animal is under water, which is different from what happens in the two former classes. In the Lizard tribe, the Pericardium adheres, as in the Tortoise, to the Peritoneum, which covers the con- vexity of the Liver. The Auricles are in general simi- lar to those of the Tortoise, but the Ventricle is observ- ed to vary much in certain Genera and Species of this S 3 order.

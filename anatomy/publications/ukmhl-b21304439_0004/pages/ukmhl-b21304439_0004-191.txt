191 Part L] OF MAMMALIA. of Labia Pudendi, there is generally a thin border of the Integuments. A Clitoris is found in Quadrupeds in general, but placed in the lower part of the Vulva, corresponding with their horizontal situation. In the Ape ti'ibe, it is larger than in Women, and is also of considerable size in most of the Glires, and in the Carnivora. The Pre- puce covering it forms, in some, as the Bear, a Pouch ; in others, as the Bitch, a Cul-de-Sac. In Animals where the Male has an Os Penis, the Fe- male has a small Bone in the Clitoris, as in the Gliresy the Bear, Cat, Lioness, &c.; but it is not found in the Dog kind. In the Rat tribe, the Clitoris and orifice of the Ure- thra are placed in front of the Vagina, appearing like the parts of a Hermaphrodite. In the Opossum, the Clitoris has a Bifid Gians, cor- responding with that in the Penis of the Male. In the Lemur Tardigradus, belonging to the order Quadrama- na, the Urethra runs through the Clitoris, and termi- nates upon its extremity. Gravid Uterus. The changes which the Uterus undergoes by Impreg- nation, vary according to the nature of the Animal to which it belongs. The Os Tincce, in all the different Mammalia, is closed soon after Impregnation, by a Gluti- nous Mucilaginous Matter, secreted by Glands or Fol- licles, which cuts off all communication between the internal

OF THE BONES z oo [P-MIT II. All Birds have a Bone termed Os Qiiadratum, by which the Lower Jaw is articulated with the Cranium I on both sides. Another small Bone is connected with it, and rests by its opposite end against the Palate, in such a manner as to elevate the Upper Jaw when the Square Bone is carried forwards by its Muscles. The Os Hyoides is divided, as in Mammalia, into a Body and two Cornua, which are of a round and slen- der form. 'i he number of the Vertebrae is as variable as in Qua- drupeds. In the Neck, they are numerous, and vary more than in the other parts of the Spine, the number depending upon the length of the Neck. The smallest number of Cervical Vertebra? is found in the Sparrow, and the Greatest in the Swan, the one having only nine, while the other has twenty-three. The Dorsal Verte- brae are fewest in the Bull-finch, being only six in num- ber, and most numerous in the Swan, which has eleven. The Lumbar Vertebrae arc united into one piece. The smallest number of Sacral Ve: tebra? exists in the Coot, there being only seven, while the Ostrich has twenty, which is the greatest. I he Turkey and Pheasant pos- sess the smallest number of Caudal Vertebrae, viz. five. The Greatest number is found in the Starling, Swallow, and Ostrich, which have nine. Each of the Bodies of the Cervical Vertebrae forms a part of a Cylinder, in consequence of which, they are allowed free motion. The three or four uppermost Vertebrae can only move forward, and the rest backward, the whole giving the form of an f; but by contracting or widening the two Arches,

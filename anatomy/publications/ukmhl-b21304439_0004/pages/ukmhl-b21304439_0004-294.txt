The Ova increase so much in some, as Frogs and Toads, towards spawning-time, as to dis- tend the Abdomen. The Ovaria are fixed by two long prolongations of the Peritoneum, to each side of the Spine, as far as the Pelvis. Along the loose edge of the Ligament are arranged the Ova, in some like rows of Beads, in others they are in clusters. The Oviducts are Membranous Tubes fixed by the Peritoneum to the sides of the Spine. At their origin, they are delicate ; in their course, they become thicker, and. in general, are much longer in proportion than in Birds. In the Turtle kind, there are two Ovaria, two Oviducts, and two Uteri. The Oviducts are thin and delicate, theJJteri thick and fleshy. Each has an opening into the Cloaca, in which, according to Blumenbach, there is an evident Clitoris. In Serpents, the Ovaria are like rows of Beads, and are composed of yellow Vesicles. Fhe Oviducts aie much convoluted, and are connected with double exter- nal openings of Genitals, which receive the double Oi- gans of the Male. Many of this class, as the Rattlesnake and Viper, are Viviparous, the Ova being hatched in the Cavity of the Oviduct. 'I he Rattlesnakes are known to couple in August, when they are frequently observed to make a noise with their Rattle, a substance peculiar to this Ani- mal, and consisting of a number of hollow, horny substan- ces, each linked into the one succeeding it, the first co- vering the last Vertebra of the Tail.

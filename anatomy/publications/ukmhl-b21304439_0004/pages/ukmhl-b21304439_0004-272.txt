OF THE EAR [Part III. 272 It is wanting, also, in the generality of Scr- ibe Skin. pents. A Tympanum, Eustachian Tube, and. Semicircular Canals, are present in the Turtle, Frog, and in most Lizards. In the Turtle, the Tympanum is in some measure divided into two parts by a contraction, which is more distinct in the Crocodile, where the inner apart- ment has Cells, somewhat like those in the Mastoid Pro- cess in the Human Species, but larger. In Lizards, the Frog, Toad, ike. the Tympanum is Membranous be- hind, and has a short but large Eustachian Tube, which communicates with the Mouth. . is neither 1 ympanum nor Eustachian i ubc m Serpents, and a few others ; but a rudiment of a Carti- laginous Ossiculum exists in some, which is inclosed in Muscular matter, the inner extremity occupying the Fenestra Ovalis. In the Turtle and Lizards, as in Birds, there is a simple Ossiculum Auditus, with a small Cartilaginous Stalk, which is joined to the Membrana Tympani. 'I he Frog and Toad have two Cartilaginous Ossicula, one joined to the Membrana Tympani, the other articulated with it, and with the Fenestra Ovalis. In Serpents, there is a rudiment of an Ossiculum, the outer end of which touches the Skin, the inner the Fe. nestra Ovalis. Of the Muscles of the Ossicula, little is known in Reptiles. The Semicircular Canals, in many of the individuals of this class, approach to a circle; each has an Am- pulla, and there is a Sac in place of a Vcstiblc; but the Fenestra Rotunda, and a complete Cochlea, are wanting, though

M OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part IV. on cadi other like tiles on a house, and exist less or more in Fishes in general. The Scales are found to cover the Cuticle, as the Hair, &c. does in other Ani- mals, but are not, like these substances, frequently changed ; instead of which, they are found to be perma- nent, and are said to increase in number as the Ani- mal becomes older. x / # The Cutis is very thick and strong in the Sturgeon, and in some of the Skate and Shark kind ; but in Fishes with large Scales, as the Cyprinus and Sparus, it is of a thin and delicate texture. In certain Vertebral Fishes, as the Carp, there are some Muscular Fibres attached to the Skin of the Back, forming; a kind of Panniculus Carnosus. In Fishes, as well as in other cold-blooded Animals, there is no Fat under the skin. In some, as the Sal- mon, there is an oily fluid ; in others, as the Moon-Jish, a substance of great thickness, like Lard, under the Skin, but it is found to be of the nature of Albumen. The Integuments of Fishes have no vessels carrying red Blood, and but very small Nerves; of course, are well fitted for protecting the tender parts within. Upon the surface of Fishes', particularly in such as live in salt water, there are Ducts, varying in number according to the kind, which pour out a Mucus to de- fend the Skin from the penetrating effects of the water. Those destitute of distinct scales, as the Skate tribe, have this Mucus in greatest abundance. In the Raja and Squulus, a set of transparent Ducts originate from a point on each side of the Animal, di- rectly over the angle of the Jaw, and a little to theoutei and

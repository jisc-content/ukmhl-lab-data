One or two Oviducts end at the Anus, or at the sides of the Branchiae, in the same place as the Penis does in the Male. This, as well as the other Species, has two large Glands, which are supposed to furnish a Gelatinous fluid, to surround the Ova. In the Gasteropodom Hermaphrodites, there is one set, as the Snail, and several others, where the Organs of the Sexes have a common outlet, and another, as the Aplysia, where they have a separate exit. The first set have a Testicle, a Vas Deferens, a Penis, and a Ve- sicle with a long Neck.

The Ova- rium is composed of a cluster of Ova, situated between the Liver and Intestines. From the Ovarium an Ovi- duct goes out, which, about the season of sexual inter- course, makes zig-zag turns, and is so connected to the Testicle, as to appear to receive liquor from it. It ter- minates in the common Cavity of Generation. In time of copulation, the Snail tribe turn out the common Cavity, which then presents the three openings of the Penis, Oviduct, and Vesicle. The Penis pene- trates the Oviduct of the other individual. The Eggs are observed to be produced a few days afterwards. The same circumstances, in general, take place among the other individuals. Of the Gasterojioda with Sexes separate, the Male of the Buccinum Undatuvi is observed to have a Testicle, which, with the Liver, fills half of the deepest part of the

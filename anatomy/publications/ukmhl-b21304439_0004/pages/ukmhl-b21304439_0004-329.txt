Part IV.] 329 OF FISHES. In being larger than the under portion of the Canal. Sometimes the Coats of the upper are thicker than those of the under part of the Gut. In the greater number of Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Rcija and Squalus, where the Canal is remarkably short, but is considerably dilated near the Stomach, the surface of the Gut internally is extended by longi- tudinal Spiral Valves. In the Sturgeon, the inner side of the Intestine forms a curious laminated Plexus and Fossula;, which are co- vered with small Glands. In the Frog-fish and Sea- Wolf, there is a lozenged appearance. In the Turbot, the inner side of the Gut has many fringed Lamina?. In the Skate tribe, there is a kind of Caecum, or Ap- pendix Vermiformis, between the small and great In- testines, but none in Fishes with Osseous Skeletons. In these the Gut is surrounded, at its origin, by small blind Appendices, or Intestinula Caeca, which open into it. They are sometimes long and slender, at other times thick and short, or simple, or ramified ; the number varying from 1 to 150 and upwards, and even in different Species of the same Genus. They are found in all the Osseous Fishes, with few exceptions, as the Pike, and secrete a fluid useful in digestion. In Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Skate, in place of these, there is a Glandular Body, which has been com- pared to the Pancreas of warm-blooded Animals. The Intestines, in Fishes strictly so called, terminate in a common Cloaca, situated near the middle of the inferior part of the Belly, or before the Anal Fin.

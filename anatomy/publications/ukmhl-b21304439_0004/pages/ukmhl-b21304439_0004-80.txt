\ SO OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part I root of the Antler. The growth is commonly finished before the end of the third month. When it is completely formed, it loses its covering of Skin and Periosteum, in consequence of the Vessels at its root being obstructed, and remains afterwards quite bare; and no distinction can now be observed, but an irregular projection of a circular form at its base. When it drops from the Head, the Integuments close over the Bone with which it was connected, till the period of its renewal returns, when a Process pro- jccts, and forms the succeeding Antler, which is always found to be longer than the preceding one. It is also observed, that the Branches of the Carotid Artery, which supply this substance, are dilated during its growth, but return to their former dimensions when it has acquired its full size. The Nails and Claws cover the last Phalanx of the Toes of Quadrupeds, and are of the same nature, and formed after the same manner, as Horns. They grow from the base to which the Integuments are fixed, and commonly cover the upper part of the Toes; but in some, as the Squirrel, Rat, &c. they entirely surround them. They belong to Quadrupeds in general, and are orginally formed before the birth of the AmmaJ. Their colour, as in the Horns, depends upon that of the Corpus Mucosum. They serve for rubbing, scraping, and for catching the prey, and, in general, for protecting the extremities of the Toes. They have no sensibility but at their roots. They are wanting in those Animals which do not use the Toes for walking, or for laying hold of the food. I tv

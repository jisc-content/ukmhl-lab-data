87 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] The Lobes of the Brain, particularly the Lateral, are not so prominent in other Animals as in Man, though there is considerable variety here among diffe- rent individuals. In the Ape, there are Posterior Lobes, and these lie over the Cerebellum, as in the Hu- man Body; but in other true Quadrupeds, the Poste- rior Lobes, strictly so called, are wanting; the Cere- bellum lying exposed behind the Cerebrum. In the Dolphin, the Cerebellum is covered by the Cerebrum. The circumvolutions of the Brain are not so deep in other Mammalia as in Man, and they are generally less numerous. In the Ape, they are much fewer. In the Rodentia, as the Mouse, &c. there are, in general, no distinctly marked convolutions ; though they are nume- rous in Carnivora, Solipeds, and Ruminants. In all Mammalia, the Cerebellum is marked nearly as in Man, with Transverse Fissures, which, in Carni- vora, Solipeds, and Ruminants, divide it into Lobules, forming Convolutions somewhat as in the Cerebrum ; but these vary much in different Animals. The middle Lobes of it are proportionally larger than in the corre- sponding parts of the Human Body. The Cortical and Medullary parts of the Brain are similar to those in Man. The Corpus Callosum, Cor- pora Striata, and Fornix, vary only a little in their breadth, the last frequently covering a considerable por- tion of the Optic Thalami. The Lateral Ventricles have no Digital Cavities, in consequence of the absence of the Posterior Lobes. The Cornua Ammonis are, in general, larger in pro- portion, but they are not so prominent on the surface, F 4 In

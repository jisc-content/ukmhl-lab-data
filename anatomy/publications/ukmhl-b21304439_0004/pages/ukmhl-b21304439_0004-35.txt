C 2 The OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. The Bones of all the Mammalia are nearly of the same colour and general appearance as those of the Human Body. In some, however, as the Dentes Mo- lares of the Elephant, and the larger Herbivorous Ani- mals, the colour is observed to vary in different parts of the same Bone. They are covered with a Periosteum, and contain Marrow, which in the Whale tribe is fluid. Ossification varies in rapidity in different Animals, and in different Bones of the same Animal. In the Internal Ear, it is complete sooner than in any other part, and the Bones of this Organ surpass all others in density. Bones acquire their complete formationâ€™ sooner or later, according to the length of time at which the Animal at- tains its full growth. Tlie Bones of some of the larger species are of a coarser texture than in the Human Body, especially those of the Whale tribe, in which the Fibrous Struc- ture is rendered very distinct by steeping them in water.

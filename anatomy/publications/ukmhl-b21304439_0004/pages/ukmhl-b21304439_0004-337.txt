337 Fart IV.] OF FISHES. nected together, and covered by a delicate Membrane. The other portion is formed of a uniform Glandular Substance, something like the soft Row or Milt of Os- seous Fishes. The Epididymis, here, is also of great size, and formed of a large Canal making innumerable convolu- tions. From this goes out a Vas Deferens, which runs along the edge of the corresponding Kidney in a zig-zag manner; increasing in size till it terminates in a Vesi- cula Seminalis near the Anus. At the outer side of the Vesicula Seininalis, is a Bag filled with a greenish matter, which is discharged into the Sac for receiving the Semen. By some Authors, this Bag is considered as a Vesicula Seminalis ; by Dr Montro, as supplying the place of a Prostate Gland. In some other Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Torpedo, the Vas Deferens and the Vesicula open into the Cloaca by means of a Papilla, the Penis being absent here, as well as in all the other Animals of the Class. In the other kind, or Roe Fishes, the Testes hold nearly the same situation as in the Raja and Squatus, and are large Glandulo-membranous Sacs; in some Cylindrical, in others Conical, &c. The size increases greatly at the spawning season; at other times, they can scarcely be distinguished from the Roe. They are filled with a white Milky-like matter, the Semen, which appears to be deposited in cells. Through the middle oi each Testicle passes a Vas Deferens, which unites with its fellow at the posterior part of the Abdomen, and opens by an orifice, com- ' Y monly

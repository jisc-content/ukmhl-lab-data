199 Part II.] OF BIRDS. and may be considered as enlargements of the Orbitar Portions. The Cavity of the Cranium is divided into two prin- cipal Fossa?, one for the Cerebrum, the other for the Thalami Optici, Cerebellum, and Medulla Oblongata. The number of the Bones of the Cranium is neaily the same, originally, as in the Human Body. The Orbits are of great size. In some, they are separated by a Membrane; in others, by a partition more or less Os- seous. The Temporal Bones have no Zygomatic Pro- cesses. The Cranium, in the whole of the class, is joined to the Bones of the Neck, by a single hemispherical Con- dyle, placed at the fore part of the Foramen Magnum. The relative magnitude of the Cranium and Jaws varies much in Birds. In some, as the Orel, the Bill bears a small proportion to the large Cranium; in others, as the Rhinoceros Bird, it is ol an extraordinary size. The Nasal and Palatine Openings also vary much in different Birds; in the Stork, they are small; in the Crane, remarkably large. The Upper Jaw, or Mandible, in niosf Birds, is more or less moveable. It either constitutes a particular Bone articulated with the Cranium, as in the Parrot kind, or is united with it into one piece, by means of elastic Bony Plates, as in Birds in general. It is immoveable in a few, as in the Cock of the Wood, and the Rhinoceros Bird. The Teeth are wanting in the different individuals of this class, the Bill supplying their place, yet acting like the Fore-teeth of those Animals that use them for seiz- ing their prey. N 4 All

In others, particularly in the Crocodile, it is more complex, being formed into three apartments, which have numerous orifices in their partitions, and these receive the Blood from the Right and Left Au- ricles, as in the Tortoise, where also Valves are placed to prevent its return. From the different apaitments the three great Arteries go out, viz. the Right and Left Aorta, and Pulmonary Artery. In the Serpents, the Heart is more simple than in the Crocodile ; there are two Auricles and a Ventricle, with two apartments, and a large communication, or the Heart here resembles, in structure, that of the Tor- toise ; there are, within the V entricle, also two Auricular Valves, and many ColumnÂ® Carneae; the former pre- venting the return of the Blood to the Auricle, thelattei mixing the Blood from the Lungs, and that from the rest of the Body, intimately together. In the Frog and Salamander Aquatica, the Heart has only one Auricle and one Ventricle, with some Colunr nse Carnese, but these not detached from the sides of the Ventricle. The Ventricle opens into the common Trunk of the Artery by a single orifice. Principal Blood-Vessels. Tortoise.-From the Right Ventricle two or three large Arteries arise, which are joined together for a short space. The Pulmonary Artery arises on the left side, and soon divides into right and left Branches which go to the corresponding Lungs. The Trunk of the Aorta commences at the right side of the bast ot

112 OF THE NOSE [Part I form the prolongations and external openings of the Nose. These are nearly cylindrical, but contracted at their extremities, particularly next the Head, where they are twice inflected upon the Intermaxillary Hones, and fixed round tire Osseous Nares. This part, is pro- tected by the Cartilage of the Nose, which is of an oval form, and so much more convex in the Male than the Female, that by this it is said the sex can be distin- guished. The Tubes are covered with a strong Tendinous Membrane, and perforated by many Mucous Follicles,- which open into their Cavities. They are separated from each other, and are both surrounded by a quanti- ty of white Adipose Substance, which also extends be- tween the different Muscles that occupy the space be- tween the Tubes and the Skin, and which have been already described. The outer part is covered by the Common Integuments, which are lined with a Tendi- nous Membrane and Cellular Substance. The Proboscis serves to pump up the drink which the Animal takes in 5 but, according to Cuvikb, the Tubes want that deli- cate structure internally, which is necessary for the Or- gan of smell; so that, in his opinion, this sense in the Elephant is confined to that part of the Nostrils con- tained in the Bones of the Head. In the Cetacea, the Nares and Spiracula differ much from the Organ of smell in other Mammalia, being placed on the summit of the Head, and serving as pas- sages of respiration, and for the rejection of the water which enters the mouth along with their Food. The two Osseous Nares are placed so high on the Head, â€¢ that

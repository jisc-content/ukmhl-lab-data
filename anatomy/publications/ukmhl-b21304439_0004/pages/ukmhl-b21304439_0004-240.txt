The Infundibulum, in Birds, ends in the Ventrkulus Callosus, Gizzard, or Third Stomach, which, in Galli- naceous Birds, is much larger than the Infundibulum ; but in others, it is the reverse. In the Pie, the Third Stomach is only about half the size of the Second, and in the Ostrich, several times less. It is generally situa- ted in the upper part of the Abdomen, close to the Spine, and resting upon the Intestines; though, in some few Birds, it is covered by these. It is commonly of a globular figure, and a little com- pressed, and is composed of four Alusiles, remarkable for their great thickness and strength. Two of these are situated laterally, and have Fibres running in a ra- diated manner about two Tendons placed at the sides of this Organ. The other two Muscles are much smaller than the former, and are situated at the extre- mities of the Stomach. The Gizzard is covered externally with a Tendinous Expansion, and lined within by a thick, strong, cal- lous Coat, considered by some as a continuation of the Cuticle. Jn the Chick, it is only a thin Pellicle, and becomes thick from attrition. This Layer forms irregularities in the inner side, which are adapted to each other on the opposite sur- faces. T he Cavity of this Stomach is proportionally small, when compared with its external surface, and its two orifices are remarkably near each othei. Its thickness is supposed to compensate for the want of Teeth. So great is the strength of this Organ, that pieces i

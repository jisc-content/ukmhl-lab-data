ORGANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part III. 284 OF formed of Polygonal Cells, containing still smaller Cells. Posteriorly, they appear to terminate in a simple bag. Serpents have, for the most part, a single Lung, and here the Trachea terminates directly into it, without dividing into Bronchi. In the young of some Reptiles, as the Tadpole, which are produced in the water, and metamorphose in their first state, in place of Lungs, there are two Bodies, the Appendices Fimbriates, like Branchiae or Gills, hanging loose by the sides of the Neck. These are gradually taken into the Thorax, in which they afterwards disappear. The Siren Lacertina, and the Proteus Anguinus, are supposed to possess both during life. In Reptiles, part of the Blood only goes to the Lungs, the rest of the mass going to the other parts of the Body, a circumstance different from what happens in the two former classes. The Pulmonary Blood-vessels ramify on the Lungs, and serve also as Bronchial Vessels, which are not found here. In Reptiles in general, where the Ribs are either confounded with the other parts of the Thorax, or are so deficient as to be unable to contribute to Respiration, this process is observed to be effected by the Animal shutting the mouth, dilating the Throat, and produc- ing a void, in consequence of which, the air enters by the Nostrils. The Throat is next contracted, so that it forces the air into the Lungs. Expiration is owin to the action of the Muscles of the Belly. In openin the Thorax of the Turtle or Frog, the Lungs remain distended for some time, owing to the parts about the Throat acting as a Valve. bfi be

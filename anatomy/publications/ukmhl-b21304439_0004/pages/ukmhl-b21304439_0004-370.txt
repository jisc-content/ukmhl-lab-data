OF INSECTS. 370 [Paut VII. res. The Male Organs in general have a Spermatic Vessel something analogous to Testes, two V esiculaj Seminales, and a Penis inclosed in a Sheath. The Testes and Vesiculae vary extremely in different Genera, being in some simple, in others complicated, and diffe- rently contorted and collected into F asciculi. The Female Organs arc more uniform than the Male. In the whole class they consist of Tubes or Ovaria, containing the Ova. The Tubes unite into two Canals, and these into an Oviduct, which terminates in a com- mon opening, the Vulva. These parts are even seen in the Chrysalis a little before the Metamorphosis. All Insects are Oviparous ; their Ova change first into Lar- va:, Caterpillars, or Maggots. The Maggot changes into the Chrysalis, Pupa, Nympho, or Aurelia. This forms the Irhago, Fly, or perfect Insect. The parts of the future Animal are observed not only in the Caterpillar, but also in the Chrysalis, though mqre distinct in the former. Before the Caterpillars change to the Chrysalis state, each spins to itself a covering. The Secretory Organ which forms this is found to be the same m Insects in general, and is well exemplified in the Silk-worm. It consists of two long tortuous Tubes, which enlarge by degrees, and form a Sac or Reservoir, from which a Duct goes out, and terminates below the Under Lip. In working the Silk, the Animal fixes its Mouth to some point of a solid substance, from which it carries out a Thread as yet glutinous; this, spun to some length, is fastened to another point, from which a second Thread ;. is

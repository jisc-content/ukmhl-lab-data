I GA OF THE MUSCLES [Paex I. rating the Stylo-hyoid Muscle. Among the Ferae, there is only one Belly, and it runs forward to be fixed to the Base of the Lower Jaw, most frequently a little beyond the Masseter. Among the Rodcntia, it is continued to the Chin, to which it is fixed. In other Mammalia, if varies a little in its general appearance and attachment, according to the nature of the Jaw, and of the motions it has to perform. Muscles about the Neele and Throat.â€”The place oi the Flatysma Myoides is supplied by the Panniculus Carnosus. The Sterno-mastoideus is nearly as in Man, but is blended in various ways with the Trapezius and Del- toides. The Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid Muscles arise in common from the Cartilaginous Extremity of the first Rib; but in the Lion, the origin of the former extends in the Thorax, along the three anterior Bones of the Sternum. In the Seal, where the Anterior Extremity of the Sternum is slender, the Sterno-hyoidcus arises from the first Rib. The Stylo-hyoideus is perforated by the Digastricus in the Ape, but not in other Quadrupeds. In Quadrupeds possessing a Styloid Process, there, is a Muscle peculiar to them, termed Stylo-mastoideus, which arises from the outer surface of the Mastoid Pro- cess, and is fixed to the Styloid, which it raises out- wards. Some Carnivora have also a small Muscle fill- ing the space between the Cornua of the Os Hyoides. The I

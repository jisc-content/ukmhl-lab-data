!220 OF THE EYE [Fart II. flat, but sometimes convex,, at other times, as in the Owl, concave. Tii Choroid Coat has no Tapetum, such as is found in many Quadrupeds. The inner side is uniformly blackish, and lined with Mucus, which prevents Birds from seeing distinctly in the dark. All Birds have Ciliary Processes, but they project so little, that they appear rather like Striae than loose Folds, and are connected to the Crystalline Lens. The boundary between the Choroides and Iris is dis- tinctly defined in this class. The Iris varies in appearance according to the Spe- cies. It is blue, red, or yellow, and commonly pos- sesses great brilliancy. In some, as the Parrot, the motions of the Iris are voluntary. The Animal can dilate or contract the Pu- pil at pleasure. A Membrana Papillaris is not observed in Foetal Birds. The Optic Nerves run here in such a manner, that it js difficult to distinguish any union in them. Upon reaching the Ball, each goes through a Sheath of the Sclerotic Coat, and then forms a round white line, from which grows the Retina. In the internal part of the Eye, there is a Membrane of a most delicate texture, somewhat resembling the Choroid Coat, and termed Marsupium Nigrum, Pecten, or Membrana Plicata, from its colour and plaited ap- pearance. It arises in the bottom of the Eye, at the entrance of the Optic Nerve, passes obliquely through the Retina, and terminates at or near the edge of the Crystalline Lens. It is formed of Plicae, varying in numbef

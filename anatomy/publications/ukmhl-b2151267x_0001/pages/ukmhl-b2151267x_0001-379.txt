Tumours, 39-40 SECTION L THE AIR PASSAGES. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. 18.1. Cleft Palate in a "Foetus at Three Months." Hunterian. GG. 56. The head of a foetus, showing a cleft of the soft palate, which might later in the natural course of development have united. As William Hunter says in the old catalogue, " it shows that the soft, as well as the hard, palate is originally fissured, and that the two halves gi'ow together afterwards. Accounts for the frequency of harelip." 18.2. Cleft of Soft Palate and Uvula. Hunterian. GG. 59. The face of a child injected red, the upper part of the head removed so as to show the roof of the mouth and pharynx, from above and behind. The soft palate is cleft up to the septum nasi, and the uvula is double, that on the right being slightly the larger. 18.3. Cleft of Soft Palate and Uvula. Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. Similar condition to the preceding, seen from behind. The two halves of the uvula fall together, so that it appears as if there were simply a perforation of the soft palate in front of them. 18.4. Incomplete Cleft Palate. Hunterian. GG. 60. The face of a child injected red, the cheeks cut away and the mouth widely opened, to show a cleft of the soft and part of the hard palate. There is only one uvulaâ€”on the right side. About

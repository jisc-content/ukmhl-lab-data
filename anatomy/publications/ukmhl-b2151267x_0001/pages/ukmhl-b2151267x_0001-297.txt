PERICARDITIS. 213 in fine vessels. The cut edges also show the injection to extend pretty well all through the crust. At the same time, some of the red colour of the free surface may be due to loose vermilion, which might readily be extravasated from the delicate new-formed vessels. The cardiac muscle is beautifully injected, and appears highly vascular. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. I., fig. 3.) 11.15. Old Acute Pericarditis, Fibrous Adhesions. Thick- ening and Opacity of the Pericardium. Hunterian. S. 67. " A heart turned out of its pericardium; there was imiversal adhesion from inflammation, as appears by the ragged surfaces of both heart and pericardium, which naturally are smooth." The rough honeycombed appearance seen in the preceding specimens is visible only at one or two points; the pericardium, both visceral and parietal, is left thickened and opaque, and studded with fibrous tags, which were adhesions between the two surfaces. 11.16. Old Pericardial Adhesion. Phthisis Pulmonalis with Excavation, Sloughing of the Pleura, Pleurisy, probably Pneumothorax. Hunterian. S. 59. " The apex of the heart adhering to the pericardium, and this last to the pleura lining the chest, by a broad adhesion which admitted of the heart's motion. A portion of the lung adjoining shows the patient to have been phthisical. Their outer surface is much covered with coagulated lymph." Over the seat of the pericardial adhesion there is a very thick loose mass of fibrin on the pleura. Below, the fibrinous exudation gets thinner and finally ceases, and below the fibrin-covered area the pleura has been perforated in two placesâ€”the upper perforation measures 2 cm. long by 6 mm. broad; of the lower, only part remains. The perforations lead directly into phthisical cavities, and probably their formation gave rise to pneumo- thorax ; the pericarditis possibly was tubercular. Microscopic examination failed to give anv information. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 57.)

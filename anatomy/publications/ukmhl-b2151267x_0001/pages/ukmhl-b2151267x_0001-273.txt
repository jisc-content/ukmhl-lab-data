"Portion of the belly of gastrocnemius from an adult male sub- ject. The other muscles of that leg and of the other leg were perfectly red. This was as white as it now appears, i.e. as white as the muscular fibres of a skate. The great veins running through the muscle had their cavities plugged with coagulated laminated blood as in varicose veins. This disease was supposed palsy of the muscles ; cause not known, perhaps frequent cramps, some blow, or accidental destruction of the nerves leading to it, though no external marks appeared."

351 THE MEMBRANA PUPILLARIS. Also, on looking through the iris at the light, the serpentine radial arteries and the lesser arterial circle near the pupillary edge show very clearly. A beautiful preparation of these vessels. 23.34. The Choroid and Iris Inverted. Ciliary Processes. Hunterian. FF. 42. The whole choroid and iris finely injected and inverted, showing the ciliary processes projecting outwards and slightly separated from one another. Rather crushed. (6) Structures which exist in the Foetus but disappear later. 23.35. The Capsulo-pupillary Membrane. Hunterian. FF. 49. The eye " of a foetus about seven months," injected red; the cornea is removed, showing a fine vascular membrane occupying the pupil, called also "membrana pupillaris." This is the anterior layer of the capsule of the crystalline lens. It receives blood- vessels from the iris and from a branch of the central artery of the retina, which runs forward to the back of the lens in the axis of the globe. The whole tunic along with its vessels usually disappears before birth. 23.36. The Capsulo-pupillary Membrane. Hunterian. FF. 49a. Iris " with membrana pupillae from a human foetus," injected red, dried and mounted in turpentine on green paper, showing the vessels of the iris passing into the membrana, and forming a rich plexus converging towards the centre. 23.37. The Capsulo-pupillary Membrane. Hunterian. FF. 51, The anterior part of a choroid, with the iris and the membrana pupillae, injected red. "The membrana pupillaris (capsulo-pupillary membrane) is very distinct, and also a little torn in the centre." On holding it between the light and the eye, the fine plexus of blood-vessels in it appears very distinct and beautiful.

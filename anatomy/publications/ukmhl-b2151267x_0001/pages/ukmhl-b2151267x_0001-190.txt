100 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. from the immediate vicinity of the fracture. The portion has been sawn off about 10 cm. above the break, probably amputation. So far as can be judged from the appearances of the bone, the case would have done very well had nature been allowed to go on with the separation of the necrosed fragments and the ordinary processes of repair after they had been got rid of. 5.93. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Necrosis. Hunterian. Upper half of an ulna macerated and dried, showing the above. A small annular sequestrum is in process of separation by rarefying osteitis above it. The amount of the disease is slight. There is a little periosteal new-formation on the shaft for about 3 cm. above the end. 5.94. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Necrosis. Hunterian. Portion of a femur macerated and dried, showing the above. There is a small annular sequestrum of dense bone in process of separation from the end of the stump. The line of separation is well marked. There is a little new bone-formation above it. Perhaps a re-amputation. 5.95. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Necrosis and Septic Caries. Hunterian. About 7 cm. of the middle of the diaphysis of a femur macerated, dried, and divided longitudinally, showing the above. The front of the solid wall of the bone is rarefied, and considerably erodedâ€” septic caries. Round the rest of the circumference of the bone a large sequestrum seems to be separating. Superficially there is a groove of separation, above which, on the front and one side, there is a portion of living bone with periosteal new-formation on its surface; but the other side is all sequestrum, and neither ex- ternally nor in the cut surface is the limit of the necrosis visible. Probably this specimen was from a re-amputation, which, it is evident, cannot have got rid of all the disease.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 230 about 1 cm. in diameter, springing from the lower surface of the innominate just about its bifurcation. The sac is fairly thick, and is lined with firm laminated thrombus. 11.62. Stratified Coagulum from the preceding Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. \Qh. Aneurisms of the Arteries of the Limbs. 11.63. Aneurism of the Femoral Artery. Hunterian. KK. 32. An aneurism apparently in the femoral artery, which appears to have been opened rather irregularly. The cavity has been filled with rather soft blood-clot, and there is a good deal of blood-clot outside it, as if there had been rupture and extravasation into the tissues. Two bougies have been put into the artery, above and below the aneurism. There is a smaller aneurism about the size of a hazel-nut, almost 4 inches below, which is filled with blood-clot. 11.64. Aneurism of the Femoral Artery. Hunterian. KK. 20. "A very large aneurism in the thigh, in the middle of the femoral artery; the artery above and below the orifice slit open to show that everywhere else it is sound." The transverse markings are too prominent, as if calcareous infiltration were present in the middle coat. The orifice is oval, 2'6 by 3 cm., and leads into an aneurism of the whole calibre of the artery, as big as a walnut; the sac of the large aneurism has been cut away, all except a small piece to the right of the orifice, but the succeeding specimen shows it to have been very large. The artery is quite as sound close to the aneurism as it is at some distance from it.' 11.65. Large Coagulum from the preceding Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 2L A section of a firm stratified thrombus, formed in concentric lamellae, and much larger than a child's head at birth, showing the size of the preceding aneurism.

218 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 11.28. Atheroma of the Aorta with Calcareous Infiltration of the Patches. Hunterian. B. 25. Portions of the abdominal aorta slit open to show the above. The brown patches indicate the calcareous plates. The vessel is generally atheromatous. 11.29. Atheroma of the Aorta with Calcareous Infiltration. Hunterian. B. 26. More advanced. The tunica intima has given way over and around many of the calcareous plates, which project bare into cavity of the vessel. They are most numerous around the mouths of the branches—coeliac axis, renal arteries, etc.—and at the bifurcation into the iliac arteries. 11.30. Atheroma of the Aorta with Calcareous Infiltration. Hunterian. B. 27. The calcareous plates are larger and thicker, and seemingly naked towards the cavity of the artery. 11.31. Advanced Atheroma of the Aorta and Iliac Arteries. Thickening and Deformity of the Vessels. Hunterian. B. 15 (1). The aorta is highly atheromatous. The iliac arteries are also highly atheromatous—their walls irregular and thickened. They have been very roughly and irregularly laid open, and the different coats a good deal torn from each other. 11.32. Atheroma. Separation of the Tunica Intima. Hunterian. B. 30&. "A portion of diseased artery, there appearing in some places to be small ossifications, and a separation of the internal coat." 11.33. Atheroma with Calcareous Infiltration. The Intima dissected down. Hunterian. B. 29. " A section of an ossified calcareous aorta slit open, showing a thin membrane turned down between the bony calcareous matter and the cavity of the vessel." At the upper part of the specimen the whole

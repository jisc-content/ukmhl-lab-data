ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. 161 of the cartilage round the edges. The creamy rough appearance, so different from the normal transparency and brightness of the cartilages, is very striking. 6. 49. Gouty Arthritis. Hunterian, LL. 44tf. Some joints of the tarsus opened, similar to the preceding. The chalky deposit thicker and apparently deeper in the cartilage. {d) Arthritis Deformans. (Synonyms: Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Chronic Osteo-arthritis.) The knee-joint is taken first, as of it alone are there specimens showing the early stages of the disease. 6.50. Arthritis Deformans of the Knee-joint. Early Stage. Hunterian. LL. 23a. Right knee-joint laid open, showing the above. There is slight osseous new-formation around the edges of the articular surfaces. This presents the typical appearanceâ€”thin lips of bone covered by what seem to be extensions of the articular cartilage ; the new surface, however, has not the same smoothness and regularity as the old; Billroth's description, "like tallow drippings," hits off their appearance exactly. The cartilage itself over several consider- able areas is opened out as if by maceration and teasing, showing its vertical fibres separated from one another, and appearing like the pile of velvet. This in some parts has been decidedly rubbed down, but not to the extent of exposing the bone. 6.51. Arthritis Deformans (?) of the Knee-joint. Erosion of Cartilage. Wearing down of the Exposed Bone. Right knee-joint opened, showing the above. There are none of the characteristic osseous outgrowths in this specimen; the cartilage is very widely eroded and destroyed, and there is con- siderable ulceration of the synovial membranes round about, so that the specimen is possibly not the result of arthritis deformans, but of some more acute process. On the other hand, the bone is worn down in the usual way, and scored in the direction of the move- L

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 19 1.88. "Spine, Ribs, and Sternum of a Foetus just 3 months old." Hunterian. N. 52. A careful dissection of the above, showing the commencement of ossification. It has commenced in the usual three centres of the vertebrae. It has not begun in the sternum, or heads of ribs. The shafts of the ribs are ossified. With the exception of the first (the joint between the manubrium and the gladiolus) the lines of seg- mentation of the sternum are not marked. 1. 89. "Skeleton of the Thorax of a Foetus between 3 and 4 months old." Hunterian. N. 53. " Divided into two equal parts, and on blue paper : everything in the spine, except the spinal processes, seems completely ossified ; the ossifications are at three different points in each vertebra, viz. in the bodj^ of the vertebra, and on each side of the foramen medullae spinalis." Having been dried, the still cartilaginous parts between the ossific centres do not appear clearly. 1.90. " Sternum and Ribs of a Foetus about 3 months old." Hunterian. N. 59. Dissected. No trace of ossification in the sternum, though the shafts of the ribs are bone. 1.91. Sternum from a Foetus of "about 4 months." Hunterian. N. 60a. Shows the usual mode of ossification just begun. The four upper centres like pin-heads are quite distinct, the place where the fifth is to be is just suggested, the sixth, that for the xiphoid process, ippears much later. In turpentine. 1.92. Sternum of a Foetus at 8 months. Hunterian. N. 61c. Divided into two thin slices, and mounted on mica. Showing five .arge centres of ossification, the usual number. I. 93. Typical Ossification of Sternum. Hunterian. N. 64. " Sternum with cartilages of the ribs and intercostal muscles, the perichondrium also left on; shows five globular ossifications in a ine under each other; the whole very vascular, injected red." In urpentine.

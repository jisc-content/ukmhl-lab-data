HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. vi The merits of the Catalogue are Dr. Teacher's. If any errors are found, I must take the censure of overlooking them during the passage of the work through the press. The microscopic specimens are preserved in the Museum, and are available for study by those desirous of learning all that may be knoiun regarding the preparations from which they were taken. A word is due to W. Kinghorn for the admirable manner in which, under Dr. Teacher's directions, he has done the work of remounting. The Bellahouston Trustees have earned the gratitude of the University, and will, I hope and believe, have reason to be satisfied with the out- come of their wise liberality. J. YOUNG, Keeper. Hunterian Museum, Deceviber, 1899.

83 OSTEOMALACIA. suffer pain in the bones, which was greatly increased when he was moved. His appetite remained good. "His nrine for the first two years generally deposited a whitish sediment, which, upon evapora- tion, became like mortar." He grew gradually weaker, and died on the 18th of February, 1775. On sectio, by Mr. Thomson assisted by Dr. Hunter, every bone in the body was found to have lost its hardness, being easily cut with a scalpel. The internal organs all appeared healthy. The articular cartilages preserved their normal colour and smoothness. The muscles, especially in the lower extremities, were exceedingly pale, " and it would scarcely have been possible to have traced them by dissection, from their contortion and adhesion to each other." In the old catalogue the specimen was described as follows : " The cavity of the bone is much enlarged, and was full of oil mixed Avith blood ; no ajjpearance of cancellae, but cross-bridges or septa here and there. The two extremities are less altered than the other parts ; the cortical part thin as paper and as soft as bees-wax almost." 5.32. Osteomalacia of the Femur. Hunterkm. LL. 2. Posterior section of the left femur. From the same case as the preceding. The middle of the shaft is soft and limp as if nothing were left but periosteum. 5.33. Osteomalacia of the Tibia and Fibula. Hwnterian. LL. 3. Posterior(?) section of the left tibia and fibula from the same case. 5.34. Osteomalacia of the Ilium. Hunterian. LL. 5. A portion of the ilium from the same case filled with the altered marrow. Obscured by a deposit of fatty matter. 5. 35. Osteomalacia of the Humerus. Hunterian. Posterior section of the right humerus, probably from the same case, macerated and dried, showing the above. The shell of the bone is extremely porous and thin. Here and there are plates of bone which are still of a solid texture. The cancellous tissue has nearly all disappeared.

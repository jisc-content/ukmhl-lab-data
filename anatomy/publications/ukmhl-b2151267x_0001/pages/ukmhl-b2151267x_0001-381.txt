297 INJURIES OF THE AIR PASSAGES. 18.9. Double Harelip and Cleft Palate. Hunterian. GG. 63. The anterior half of the head of a child, the brain removed, and the mouth slit towards each ear. The uvula is double, and the hard palate has failed to unite with the vomer on both sides; the premaxilla has united with the maxillary processes, but only by a narrow strip of soft tissue, and it projects considerably, and is turned upwards. The harelip is double and extends into the nostril on either side of the prenvaxilla. 18.10, Double Harelip and Cleft Palate. Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The head of a child, the mouth slit back to the ears to show the above. An extreme degree of the condition, there being hardly any palate. The base of the vomer, considerably expanded, forms a sort of roof to the mouth. The premaxilla, carried on the end of the vomer, projects in the usual way below the point of the nose. II. Injuries of the Air Passages. 18.11. Wound of the Air Passages. Cut Throat. Hunterian. GG. 50a. "The hyoid bone, larynx, and portion of trachea with pharynx, from a man who cut his own throat, and was recovering, but died from some other accident (Bengal)." The wound has cut across the th3'ro-hyoid membrane, dividing the epiglottis about its middle. The relations of the parts are very much altered. The skin has grown deeply in, and has united with the mucous membrane, so that a permanent opening into the trachea would probably have remained. Two bristles mark the outer corners of the wound. Two other bristles show the halves of the hyoid bone, which has been divided to show the interior of the larynx. The upper part of the epiglottis is drawn up to one side, and is attached to the left half of the bone. The glottis seems to be swollen and narrowed. A wound in this position readily opens the larynx, but it is not, as a rule, immediately fatal, as it fails to reach the great vessels.

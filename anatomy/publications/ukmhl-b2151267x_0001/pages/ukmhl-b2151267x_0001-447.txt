The External Ear or Pinna. Hunterian. HH. 3. Uninjected, showing the shape of the pinna and its various eminences and fossae as follows : First, the large central hollow or concha from which the external auditor}^ meatus opens. In front and overhanging this is a conical prominence—the tragus— below and behind which, and separated from it by a little hollow, is another eminence—the antitragus—with the lobule hanging below. The larger upper part of the ear is bounded by a ridge called helix, inside which is the fossa of the helix, separating it from a broader rounded eminence called antihelix, which spreads out above into two limbs, enclosing a space called fossa of the anti- helix or triangular fossa. 25.2, The External Ear or Pinna. Hunterian. HH. 4. Injected red and the cuticle removed. 25.3. The External Ear or Pinna. Hunterian. HH. 4a. Similar to the preceding.

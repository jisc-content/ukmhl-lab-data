147 TUBERCULAR ARTHRITIS. history; consequently, not quite certainly tubercular. The knee- joint has been taken first, as it was the one least badly represented; also because specimens of it are most rÂ«adily obtained ; and because, from its size and structure, it serves particularly well to illustrate the effects of the disease upon the joints generally. (a) where destructive changes were in progress. 6.7. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Hunterian. LL. 49. Lower end of right femur dissected out, illustrating the above. The articular cartilage is thick and opaque, and in several places raised from the bone ; apparently sloughing. At one point of the outer condyle it is quite destroyed, and the bone laid bare. 6.8. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Hunterian. LL. 235. A slice of the head of the tibia injected red, and the superficial soft parts dissected off". The greater part of the articular cartilage is quite destroyed, and its place taken by granulations. The bone in parts is bare and carious. An advanced stage in the destruction of the joint by tubercular disease. 6.9. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Hunterian. LL. 23c. A patella dissected out, showing the above. The cartilage is eroded, and the bone on the articular surface and round the edges is carious. 6.10. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Jeffray Collection. Right knee-joint, probably tubercular, laid open, and all the soft parts dissected off down to the periosteum, to show the articular surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella. Illustrates chiefly the destruction of the articular cartilages. Dry Specimens illustrating the Changes in the Bones. 6.11. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Changes in the Bones. Hunterian. Head of tibia macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The cartilage has been removed by disease or maceration, revealing in

PREFACE. xix The remounting has greatly improved the appearance of the pre- parations, and accidents, even of the most trifling description, were very few indeed. Experiments were made on specimens which there was reason to fear were spoilt beyond redemption, but it was mar- vellous how some dim and dirty specimens revived in the fresh spirit, and proved to be beautiful injections well worth exhibition. Besides the additions from the old collections already mentioned, a immber of valuable and interesting preparations have been received from practitioners, which help to fill the gaps in the series. These are acknowledged by the donor's name being set down beside the title of the specimen. Not the least valuable feature of these new specimens is that the donors have kindly furnished histories of them. It is to be hoped that the good practice of presenting interesting preparations (both anatomical and pathological) to the museum will be continued; gaps are shown here and there in the catalogue which invite contributions of this kind. The compilation of the whole catalogue was supervised by Pro- fessor Young. In the earlier part of the work the late Professor Coats was frequently consulted about specimens, but his illness unfortunately deprived the latter parts of the catalogue of this assistance.

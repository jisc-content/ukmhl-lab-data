HUNTER,!AN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 244 12.30. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Eunterian. QQ. 9. A testicle with one side removed; there is no mercury among the tubules; in the cord there are a number of lymphatics, filled with mercury, gradually uniting into two fairly large vessels. 12.31. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Hunterian. QQ. 6. The epididymis injected with mercury, which has passed through the testicle by rupturing some of the tubules and filled a large lymphatic on the spermatic cord. At several points slices have been taken off the cord, allowing the mercury to escape, and parts of the vessel are now seen as empty spaces. 12.32. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Bear. Hunterian. QQ: 8. Like the preceding specimens, it has been prepared by injecting the vas deferens till rupture of some tubules occurred, and the mercury, extravasated within the tunica albuginea, found its way out by the lymphatics. The pampiniform plexus of veins has been dilated with air before drying. In turpentine on mica. 12.33. The Lymphatics of the Uterus in the Gravid Condition. Hunterian. D. 25. " A section of the gravid uterus at the ninth month." The lymphatics of the uterus run down along the course of the hypo- gastric artery to about the level of the cervix, pass out by the broad ligament to the glands on the internal iliac artery, and up to the lumbar glands. In the unimpregnated uterus they are very small, but in the gravid state, as the specimen shows, they become very large; they are probablj' overdistended with mercury in this specimen. 12.34. The Lymphatics of the Uterus. Superficial Set. Jeffray Collection C?). There is neither history nor description of the specimen ; but, from its shape and by microscopic examination, it has been determined to be uterus. There is a plexus of vessels, of various sizes, but mostly small, running just under the peritoneum, and converging

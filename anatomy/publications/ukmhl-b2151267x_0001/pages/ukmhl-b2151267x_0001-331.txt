The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lungs. Porpoise. Hunterian. QQ. 69. The arteries are injected red, the lymphatics with mercury. There is not a network as in the human subject, but long vessels run towards the root of the lung, anastomosing freely in the earlier part of their course. In turpentine on white paper. 12.44. The Lymphatics of the Lungs. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 70. The lymphatics, injected with mercury, are seen forming a very regular network in the subpleural tissue. In turpentine on red paper. 12.45. The Lymphatics of the Lungs. Turtle. Hunterian. D. 12. A large slice of the exterior of the lung injected with mercury, the superficial lymphatics, as in the previous specimen, forming a fairly regular network; only the larger vessels injected. In turpentine, supported by a sheet of very thin wood. Not described in the old catalogue, but on the foot of the jar is cut, "Lymphatics Lungs Turtle." (/) The Lymphatics of the Liver. 12.46. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Liver. Hunterian. D. 20. A portion of the upper surface of the liver injected red by the arteries, showing the superficial lymphatics injected with mercury, forming a close arborescent plexus below the peritoneal covering of the organ. The larger trunks are seen running off into one of the ligaments on their way to the lymphatic glands. " The preparation appears natural, as the vessels are not dried."

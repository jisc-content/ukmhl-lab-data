210 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. SECTION I. THE HEART. I. Congenital Malformations. 11.1. Increased Number of the Semi-lunar Valves. Hunterian. B. 7. " The beginning of the pulmonary artery sHt open, showing four sigmoid valves instead of three." II. Injuries of the Heart. 11.2. Wound of the Heart. Hunterian. S. 68 " The carpenter's heart, who, in dovetaihng a piece of wood, ran the chisel through the septum ventriculorum, and died suddenly." The chisel has entered the heart near the apex of the right ventricle close to the interventricular sulcus, and run through the edge of the cavity of the right into the cavity of the left ventricle, transfixing one of the musculi papillares. A piece of wood indicates the course of the tool, and a second smaller piece is passed into the right vtotricle to show that it also had been entered. III. Changes due to Conditions affecting the Nutrition of the Heart. (a) Aneurism and Spontaneous Rupture of the Heart. 11.3. Localized Dilatation or Aneurism of the Left Ven- tricle. Fibrous Transformation of Muscle. Hunterian. KK. 31 " A portion of the left ventricle of the heart dilated at the apex into a bag large enough to hold a common pear. From the dissecting room." At the seat of dilatation the wall of the ven tricle is very much thinned, and scarcely a trace of muscular fibre is to be seen in the cut. surfaceâ€”clearly a case of fibrous transformation. The condition of the coronary arteries could not l)e made out. There is a pericardial adhesion at the apex of the bag, which has probably had something to do with the production of the aneurism.

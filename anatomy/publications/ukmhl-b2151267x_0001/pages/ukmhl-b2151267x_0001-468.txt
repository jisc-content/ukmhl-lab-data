HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 384 27. 36. Epidermis Stretched by a Tumour, Hunterian. II'. 3la. "A portion of the cuticle from an exostosis of the thigh in which the limb was become as thick as the trunk of the body ; the intention was to discover pores open at both ends, but they were not visible this way; the hairs in consequence of the dis- tension are removed at a greater distance (from one another) than they were originally." Vide Cruikshank, "Experiments on the Insensible Perspiration of the Human Body," 8vo. (pamphlet), London, 1795. Epidermal Appendages. 27.37. Epidermal Appendages. Nails and Hairs. Hunterian. II. ?>\h. A portion of the cuticle from the upper side of the foot, showing the relation of the nails and roots of the hairs to the epidermis ; also the short processes of epidermis which dip into the pores and between the papillae of the cutis vera. The cuticle is desquamating in large scales. Compare next specimen. 27. 38. Epidermal Appendages. Hairs. Desquamation of the Cuticle. Hunterian. II. 31c. A portion of the skin of the back of the foot, showing the roots of a number of hairs and the cuticle desquamating in large scales. The cuticle is normally shed in very fine, almost invisible, dust; the condition here resembles that which is seen on a limb that has been covered by a dressing or bandage for a long timeâ€”the epidermis being protected is able to form flakes of considerable size, which become loose, and are shed as such. 27.39. Epidermal Appendages. Nails. Hunterian. II. 35. The cuticle of the great toe with the nail, inverted, showing the nail continuous with the cuticle as if only a continuation of it. The root of the nail runs under it loose for about 6 mm. The root of the nail is white, and the papillae of the cutis vera project into it irregularly; in front, the body of the nail is yellow and horny, and marked with regular longitudinal ridges,

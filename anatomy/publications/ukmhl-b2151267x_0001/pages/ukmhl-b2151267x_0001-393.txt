Malignant Adenoma of the Thyroid Gland. Second- ary Infection of Lymphatic Glands. Hunterian. GG. 52a. The larynx and trachea and the thyroid gland much enlarged. The enlargement is rather irregular and lobulated, and affects the left side more than the right. There are also a number of greatly enlarged lymphatic glands. In section the tumour presents a mixed appear- ance, parts having the structure of the thyroid gland undergoing cystic change, while the other parts are of a lighter colour and homogeneous without any cystic development. Parts also appear to be breaking down. Microscopic examinationâ€”the structure is that of normal thyroid gland, but in the homogeneous areas the acini are mostly of small size, lined with a few cells of typical thyroid epithelium, and with a very small lumen; here and there they are dilated and filled with colloid material. The section of an affected lymphatic gland shows a structure similar to this last; the loculi are regular, mostly small, but some dilated and filled with colloid material; it is as if the gland were being infiltrated with young thyroid gland tissue.

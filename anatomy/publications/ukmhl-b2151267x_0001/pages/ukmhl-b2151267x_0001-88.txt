HUNTER!AN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 4 series of Gothic arches extending to the top of the shaft. From the lower j^art of the convexity of the upper arch and lower wall of the neck rises a distinct series of strong plates, which run obliquely to the base of the head and neighbouring part of the upper wall of the neck. Crossing those obliquely is a second set of fibres running nearly parallel to the upper border of the neck. The epiphysial line is well marked. Osseous plates run from it in more or less regular lines perpendicular to the articular surface. In the great trochanter the cancellous tissue is irre- gular. Dry. 1.9. Structure of a Short Bone. Hunterian. N. I33a. A portion of one of the tarsal bones showing that it is composed, like the heads of the long bones, of a mass of cancellous tissue enclosed in a thin shell of compact bone. Injected red and macerated. 1.10. Structure of a Flat Bone. /. H. T. 1897. Section of the occipital bone, macerated and dried, showing the inner and outer tables of compact bone and the intervening layer of cancellous bone,â€”^the diploe. Dry. The Bones of the Skull. 1.11. The Occipital Bone. Hunterian. I. 13. An occipital bone " made transparent in an acid," dried and varnished, showing the distribution and extent of the diploe. The tables of solid bone are clear like horn; the spaces of the diploe, being filled with air, appear by reflected light as a network of coarse white lines. By transmitted light they can be very well seen in the thinner parts of the bone as clear streaks. Dry. 1.12. The Parietal Bone. Hunterian. I. 11a. A similar preparation of the parietal bone showing the distri- bution of the diploe. There are also seen several large vascular channels rising out of the cancellous areas and running towards the sutures, where they are usually connected through foramina with the vessels of the dura mater.

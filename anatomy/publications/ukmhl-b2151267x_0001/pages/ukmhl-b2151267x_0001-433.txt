349 THE CHOROID AND IRIS 23.22. The Arteries of the Choroid and Iris. Hunterian. FF. 26. A section of the optic nerve and eyeball, the vitreous humour, lens, and retina removed, shovping the ciliary arteries in the above very minutely injected. 23.23. The Arteries of the Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 27a. Posterior half of an eyeball injected red, showing the above making a fine network. The entrance of the optic nerve is dis- tinguished by the absence of vessels. 23.24. The Choroid and Iris. Hunterian. FF. 27c. Half of the above from an injected eye, hung by the optic nerve, showing the arteries injected red, the veins white. 23.25. The Veins of the Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 28. "An eyeball, sclerotica partly removed, to look on the choroid from without. The veins are the principal objects, injected white and forming the vasa vorticosa of Steno. The arteries are injected red, but less successfully. A very fine preparation." The arrange- ment of the veins, coming to the choroid about the transverse equator of the eyeball, and being immediately distributed on it in vortices of small branches, is very beautifully displayed. 23.26. The Arteries and Veins of the Choroid and Iris. Hunterian. FF. 29. An eyeball, with the sclerotic and cornea completely rem.oved, showing the above; arteries injected red, veins white. The former are seen running in nearly parallel wavy lines from behind forwards. The latter as described in the preceding. 23.27. The Arteries of the Iris. Hunterian. FF. 30. An eyeball, the anterior part of the sclerotic and the cornea removed, showing the choroid and iris finely injected red, " and very vascular."

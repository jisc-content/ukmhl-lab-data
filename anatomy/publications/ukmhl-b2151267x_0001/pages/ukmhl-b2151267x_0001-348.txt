264 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 12.114. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turbot. Hunterian. D. 32. A portion of the intestine laid open, the arteries injected red, the lymphatics with mercury. A number of very large vessels, having a twisted varicose appearance, are seen running in the ridges, which take the place of villi. Some of these vessels probably belong to the deep set in the submucous tissue; others, however, seem to lie in the mucous membrane itself. Compare next specimen. 12.115. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turbot. Hunterian. QQ. 46. A portion of the intestine laid open, the lymphatics of the villi, or rather folds which represent the villi in this animal, finely injected with mercury. They form a fine network of vessels running in the very edges of the villi. These vessels were injected by inverting the intestine after the deep lymphatics had been filled in the usual way, and pressing it, whereby the mercury is forced into them. (Hewson's Works, p. 15.5.) 12.116. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turbot. Hunterian. QQ. 48. Similar to the preceding. 12.117. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turbot. Hunterian. QQ. 42. " A piece of the opened intestine of the turbot, the arteries injected to great minuteness with size and vermilion." A few lymphatics, filled with mercury, are seen in the edges of the villi and in the subperitoneal connective tissue. 12.118. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Cod. Hunterian. QQ. 43. A piece of intestine laid open, the arteries injected red, the lymphatics with mercury. The mucous membrane has no ridges like those of the turbot's intestine, but is smooth, and, with a

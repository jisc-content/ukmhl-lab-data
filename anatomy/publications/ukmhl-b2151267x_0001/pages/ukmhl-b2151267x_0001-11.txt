Whe7i the Bellahouston Trustees offered a liberal contribution towards the better arrangevient and cataloguing of the Hunterian Anatomical and Pathological Preparations, the University were fortunate in having one of its own graduates ivell qualified and willing to undertake the task. Dr. J. H. Teacher entered zealously on the work, and, carefully instructing himself as to the methods pursued in the Roycd Colleges of Surgeons in Edinburgh and London, began the re-arrangement of the series. U'nder his direction the preparations were remounted, and the bones carefully exhibited in glass jars. It was not a light task, as will be seen from the numbers given in his Introduction; for he had not only to verify the brief description given in the earlier Catalogue, but he had to search for the many scattered references to the prepara- tions in William Hunter's published writings and unpublished manu- scripts. How he has accomplished the work will be judged by those ivho visit the collection and compare it ivith the Catalogue. But I may be permitted to say that, having followed the work closely, I can bear testimony to the extreme care and scrupulous accuracy with which every specimen has been studied and shown to the best advantage. The chctpters introductory to the various sections are a valuable contribution to the history of opinion, and a vindication of William Hunter's claims, too long neglected or misunderstood, to rank as an observer of high merit and a physiologist of remarkable perspicacity, as a leader in ana- tomical speculation, as he had been a pioneer in anatomical teaching. The price at which the Catalogue is available to the students permits all to possess it, and thus to extend their anatomical and pathological knowledge by the study of the finest specimens illustrating the progress of Hunter's researches.

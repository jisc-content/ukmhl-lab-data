INFLAMMATION OF BONE DUE TO SYPHILIS. 123 but very porous. A little below the middle of the inner surface and crest of the tibia is a node-like swelling with distinct raised borders, which probably underlay an ulcer. Its surface is slightly more porous than the surrounding bone, but not ulcerated. Pro- bably syphilitic. 5.151. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. A fibula macerated and dried. The middle two-thirds of the shaft is covered with a thin crust of periosteal new bone. Probably syphilitic. 5.152. Syphilitic (Ulcer ?) Enlargement of Fibula. Hunterian. Portion of a fibula macerated, dried, and divided longitudinally. It is considerably thickened from end to end. The periosteal new bone has been formed very irregularly, giving to most of its surface a rough tuberculated appearance, but leaving almost un- altered patches of the old surface here and there. It is an old standing condition; the new bone is mostly dense. In the cut surface the old shell is, for the most part, distinguishable from the new bone. Here and there it has been considerably eroded from within. The condition was probably of syphilitic origin, compli- cated by ulcers, the irritation from which would increase the inflam- mation and new-formation of bone. 5.153. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. Fibula from a very tall person, macerated and dried, showing considerably enlargement. Probably syphilitic. 5.154. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. Fibula from a tall person, macerated and dried, showing the lower half of its shaft about doubled in diameter in consequence of periostitis. Probably syphilitic. 5.155. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. A fibula macerated and dried, showing a great enlargement of the lower part of its shaft similar to that in the preceding, but in an

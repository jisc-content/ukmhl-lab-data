196 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. seems to have been slightly oblique from before and above down- wards and backwards. 9.16. Bone from an Old Stump. Hunterian. A portion of the shaft of a femur macerated and dried. The end of the bone is quite smooth and rather narrower than the shaft higher up. There is a slight extension of it backwards by new bone. The medullary cavity is closed with dense bone. The saw-cut has been oblique. Compare No. 9.14. 9.17. Bones from an Old Stump of the Leg. Atrophy, probably from Disuse. Hunterian, Upper portion, about one-third, of right tibia and fibula, probably from a grave. The edges of the bones are bevelled off all round. They are capped by some new-formed bone, which ankyloses them to one another. The shape of the extremity is conical. The bones are extremely thin and light. Evidently from a very old amputa- tion. There is a little periosteal new bone on the shaft of the tibia ; also a pick mark. 9.18. Bone from an Ulcerated Stump. Hunterian. Portion, about 7 cm. long, of tibia and fibula, macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The bones are ankylosed in the same way as the preceding. The ends are slightly expanded, and present a flat eroded surface, which appears to have formed the base of an ulcer. The shafts of the bones above are roughened by periosteal new- formation. They are also extremely porous and light. Apparently a re-amputation from an ulcerating inflamed stump. The saw-cut has passed in a direction from before backwards and slightly down- wards. Compare the preceding specimens, which nearly all show an oblique direction of the saw-cut.

TUBERCULAR ARTHRITIS. 157 disease having destroyed the joint very extensively, and i^erhaps to long-standing septic osteitis about it before ankylosis and healing- resulted. 6.38. Tubercular Arthritis. Elbow-joint. Natural Cure by Ankylosis. Good Position. Hunterian. Humerus and ulna, probably from a grave. The position is very much the same as in the two preceding specimens. Evidently a very old ankylosis. A portion of the bone has been sawn off on the inner side to show the nature of the ankylosis. The line of the edge of the olecranon is traceable on the exterior, but internally there is not a sign that the bones were ever distinctâ€”the cancellous tissue of the two is absolutely continuous. 6.39. Tubercular Arthritis. Elbow. Natural Cure by Ankylosis. Bad Position. Hunterian. Humerus and ulna, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. They are united at slightly less than a right angle. The radius has been free, but probably fixed by fibrous adhesion, as the articular facet for it is very imperfectly formed. A very old ankylosis. 6.40. Tubercular Arthritis. Elbow. Natural Cure by Ankylosis. Bad Position. Hunterian. Humerus and portion of an ulna, from a grave, illustrating the above. The ulna is almost at right angles to the humerus, but turned outwards, and also dislocated to its outside, and fused with the internal condyle and epicondyle. The radius seems to have been ankylosed to the ulna, but it has been broken away. An old ankylosis, the lines of union hardly traceable. (c) Ankyloses of Doubtful Origin. 6.41. Ankylosis of Tarsal and Metatarsal Bones. Hunterian. The specimen, which has probably been obtained from a grave, consists of all the tarsal bones and the first metatarsal and bases of the other four, the shafts having been broken off. They are all fused

The Symphysis Pubis. Hunterian. M. 4. "A perpendicular section of the superior ends of the ossa pubis so as to look upon the symphysis; this joint consists of two fibro- cartilaginous surfaces, and transverse ligamentous fibres passing from one to the other; about the middle there is sometimes a discon- tinuation of these transverse fibres, and a kind of cartilaginous pulp only, as between the vertebrae, and sometimes a cavity with syn- ovia."

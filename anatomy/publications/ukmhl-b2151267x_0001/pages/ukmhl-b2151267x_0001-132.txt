HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48 might be a separation of the epiphysis. In the absence of a history, a rather unsatisfactory specimen. Tlie description in the MSS., which certainly does not apply to the specimen in the jar now, was : " Diseased joint: foot from Battersea : looks like a fracture. (Case Mr. Hewson's)." 3.29. United Fracture of the Humerus about the Surgical Neck. Hunterian. Left humerus macerated and dried, showing the above. The fracture has passed rather below the surgical neck. The lower end of the upper fragment has been thrown forward, and the lower fragment drawn upwards, inwards, and forwards. Union has been accomplished with very little thickening, but with a considerable bend forwards at the seat of the injury. 3.30. Very old United Fracture in the Upper Third of the Humerus, above the Insertion of the Deltoid. Hunterian. Left humerus minus the head, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. The fracture has passed 2 or 3 cm. lower than in the last. It is of such old standing that its line cannot now be traced. There is a considerable bend outwards and forwards, the upper fragment having been abducted by the muscles inserted into the great tuberosity, while the teres major and latissimus dorsi have not been able to draw the lower fragment inwards, and it has been drawn upwards and forwards by the deltoid, biceps, and coraco- brachialis. Consequently the fracture has united with the bone curved as if by too big a pad in the axilla. 3.31. United Fracture below the Insertion of the Deltoid. Hunterian. Left humerus macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has passed from above and inside, downwards, outwards, and forwards. It has healed with a moderate amount of thickening and only slight deformity, due to abduction of the upper fragment by the deltoid, and slight overlapping of the oblique ends. Short- ening must have been very slight, and there is no interference with the musculo-spiral groove. A very good union.

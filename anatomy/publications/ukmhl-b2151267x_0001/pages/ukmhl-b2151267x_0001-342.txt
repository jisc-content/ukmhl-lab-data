258 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. anastomose freely. The colours are rather faded. The bowel is filled with plaster of Paris. 12.94. The Lymphatics of the Small Intestine. Lacteals. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 24. A portion of the intestine laid open, with the arteries injected red, the veins black, and the Ij'mphatics with mercury. As in the last specimen, the lymphatics are seen accompanying the blood-vesselsâ€”the artery in the middle, two venae comites, one on each side, and outside these a lymphatic vessel on each side. Inside the intestine a few lymphatics are also visible in the villi of the mucous membrane. 12.95. The Lymphatics of the Intestine and Mesentery. Lacteals. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 25. A portion of the intestine with mesentery, injected like the preceding, but not opened. The bowel in this and the five succeeding specimens is filled with plaster of Paris. 12.96. The Lymphatics of the Intestine and Mesentery. Lacteals. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 26. A portion of the intestine with mesentery, the arteries injected red, the veins black, and the lymphatics with mercury. The latter are very well injected, by Hewson's method of forcing the valves (see under No. 12.106); and the superficial set is seen running, chiefly in a longitudinal direction, in the sub- peritoneal connective tissue, and between the fibres of the outer (longitudinal) layer of muscle. " In the middle of the mesentery the smaller absorbents form a very intricate plexus or network resembling a sort of gland, and probably doing the same office as absorbent (lymphatic) glands in the mesenteries of other animals." There are no lymphatic glands in reptiles and fish, and the spleen is very small. 12.97. The Lymphatics of the Intestine and Mesentery. Lacteals. Turtle, Hunterian. QQ. 26a. This specimen was not numbered, but it is very similar to the preceding, and is probably QQ. 26a, which was supposed to be amissing.

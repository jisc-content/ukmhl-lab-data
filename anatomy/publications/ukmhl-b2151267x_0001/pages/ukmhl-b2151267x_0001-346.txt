HUNTER!AN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 262 description shall be given in the next chapter), so that I have now no doubt but that those cells are parts of the lymphatic system, and that the small absorbent vessels of the internal coat pour their fluid into this network, from which it is conveyed by the larger lacteals." Compare No. 12.112, Lacteals of Turbot. 12.107. Lymphatics of the Intestine. Superficial and Deep. Turtle. Hunterian. D. Uft. A similar preparation to the preceding. The intestine is dis- tended, and the lymphatics are even more finely injected, the mercury in the spaces of the submucosa making a glittering sheet of metal intersected by dark lines, which are the remains of the areolar tissue compressed by the mercury and shrunk by drying. In turpentine. For mode of preparation, see No. 12.106. 12.108. The Superficial and Deep Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 29. A portion of the small intestine injected like the preceding by forcing the valves with mercury. The lymphatic spaces be- tween the muscular and mucous coats are not so much distended as in the two preceding specimens. See No. 12.106. 12.109. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Superficial and Deep. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 30. A portion of the small intestine prepared in the same way as No. 12.106, both sets of lymphatic vessels of the intestine and those of the mesentery very finely injected. Veins and arteries injected black. In turpentine. 12.110. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. The Deep Set from within. Turtle. Hunterian. QQ. 31. A piece of small intestine prepared in the same way as No. 12.106, and inverted, showing the lymph spaces between the muscular and mucous coats distended in a manner which suggests extravasation, but is not, the vessels not being ruptured. See under No. 12.106. In turpentine.

THE CUTIS VERA. 387 down and floating. This is the pajjillary layer of the cutis vera separated by dissection, and the surface left is rough and irregular, there being no natural separation like that between the cuticle and cutis, which yields to maceration or scalding. The preparation shows the vascularity of the papillary layer to be greater than that of the subjacent laj^er of the cutis vera. Oruikshank believed this to be another naturally distinct layer of the skin, though not so distinct as epidermis and cutis vera. Vide " Experiments on the Insensible Perspiration," London, 1795. 27.51. The Papillary Layer of the Cutis Vera. Hunterian. II. 53. A similar preparation but uninjected, from a negro. 27, 52. The Cutis Vera. Hunterian. II. 54. Portion of the skin of a negro to show the cutis vera after the papillary layer has been dissected away; it is rough and fibrous like the cut surface of leather—it is raw human leather. 27.53. The Cutis Vera. Hunterian. II. 56. A portion of the skin showing the cutis vera torn without maceration into three layers, the outer the most dense. The separation is quite artificial. Comparative Anatomy of the Integuments. 27.54. Skin of Elephant. Tanned. Hunterian. II. 47. A small portion of the above, the epidermis turned down and now fallen away entirely. It is seen to send prolongations into the sweat ducts, which are of considerable size, and marked with bristles which are passed in a considerable distance. The cutis vera is about 2*2 cm. thick, and is raised into small papillae, which fit into corresponding hollows of the cuticle; a magnifying glass is almost necessary to see them. 27.55. Skin of Elephant. Tanned. Hunterian. II. 48. Another portion of the same—elephant leather. 2b2

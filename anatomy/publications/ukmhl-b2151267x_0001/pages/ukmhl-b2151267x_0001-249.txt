165 ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. tibial surface has also not been in contact with its opponent. Perhaps not arthritis deformans, but an old fracture of the tip of the fibula and dislocation outwards. Both bones show traces of periostitis about the middle of their shafts, which has an appear- ance very suggestive of syphilis. 6.60. Arthritis Deformans of the Ankle. Hunterian. Kight tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. The lower end of the bone shows some periostitic new-formation on the sides, and also characteristic outgrowths round the articular surface, which is also very rough, irregular, slightly eburnated, and full of small holes. 6.61. Arthritis Deformans of the Ankle. Early Stage. Hunterian. LL. 16. Lower end of tibia and fibula, soft parts dissected away, showing the articular surfaces covered with cartilage, which is very much worn down, and scored in the direction of flexion and extension. It seems also to be opened out into fibrillae set perpendicular to the articular plate. For examples of changes similar to Arthritis Deformans of the Ankle-joint associated with Fracture, see specimens Nos. 3. 80, 3. 83, 3. 91, and 3. 95. 6.62. Arthritis Deformans of the Hip-joint. Hunterian. Portion of left femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The head of the femur is rendered somewhat conical in shape by an overgrowth of bone of the usual type around the edges, forming, as it were, an extension of the articular surface, and making a sort of collar round the neck, in places fully 1 cm. wide. There is a similar outgrowth around the fossa for the insertion of the ligamentum teres. On its upper surface the head is decidedly worn down, slightly ebur- nated, and scored with numerous fine lines, from the direction of which it would appear that the movements on the pelvis have been limited and were chiefly abduction and adduction.

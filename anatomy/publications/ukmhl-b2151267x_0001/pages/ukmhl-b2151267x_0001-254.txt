HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 170 The head of the radius presents a wide, slightly convex quadrilateral surface looking inwards and backwards. It is porous and eburnated, and plays on a slightly concave, eburnated surface on the front of the lower end of the humerus. The surface for the ulna on the latter bone is carried up the shaft over the coronoid depression, corresponding with the wide shallow surface on the ulna. Move- ment must have been very limited, with the joint pretty nearly fixed at a right angle. 6.74. Arthritis Deformans of the Elbow. Hunterian. Left humerus macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The ulnar surface of the articular end is carried up the front over the coronoid depression. The radial is very rough. There is a good deal of osteophytic extension round the edges. 6.75. Arthritis Deformans of the Elbow. Hunterian. Left ulna and radius macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces of the ulna are irregular and greatly increased in area. The head of the radius is still fairly circular; on its inner surface it is deepened by a collar of bone corresponding with the enlarged lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna.

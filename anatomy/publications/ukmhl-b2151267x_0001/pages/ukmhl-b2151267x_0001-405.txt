321 TEE CEREBELLUM. 21.44. The Cerebellum. Hunterian. E. 13a. A similar portion of cerebellum, slightly macerated to separate the convolutions. 21.45. The Corpus Dentatum of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 16a. "A section of the cerebellum of a man who had long been mad, and died so. The appearance in the centre of the medullary part, which resembles the section of a supra-renal capsule, was thought to be at first peculiar, but by comparing it with others, it appears to be common though unnoticed." It is the central grey mass of the cerebellum called corpus dentatum. 21.46. The Corpus Dentatum of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 165. Another portion of the same. 21.47. The Nutrient Vessels of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 19. A section of the cerebellum of a very young child, finely injected red. The vessels entering the cerebellar tissue, like those entering the cerebral tissue, are very small. The centre appears very vascular. 21.48. The Nutrient Vessels of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. E. 14. A similar specimen dried and mounted in spirit. 21.49. Sagittal Section of the Head of a Young Woman. Hunterian. EE. 33. The right half of the head, the section slightly oblique, and passing just to the left of the falx cerebri and nasal septum, showing the layers of the scalp, bones of cranium, contents of cranial cavity, and the cavities of the nose, mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, and trachea. The structures shown are indicated in detail in the accompanying diagram. The mode of preparation of the specimen is unknown, but some means, such X

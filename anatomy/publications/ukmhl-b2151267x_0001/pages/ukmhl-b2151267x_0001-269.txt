185 MUSCLE AND TENDON. 7.5. The Blood-vessels and the Relations of Muscle and Tendon. Hunterian. H. 5. "Diaphragm from a child of larger size, injected red, but with coarse injection; is of course less minute, but more distinct:" i.e. it shows more clearly the arrangement of the blood-vessels. Compare next specimen. The supply of blood to the muscle is much richer than to the tendon. Mounted in turpentine. 7.6. The Blood-vessels of Muscle. Hunterian. H. 6. "A longitudinal section of a rectilineal muscle very minutely injected; the arteries run chiefly in the direction of the muscular fibres." Compare the preceding. Mounted in turpentine. 7.7. The Blood-vessels and the Relations of Muscle and Tendon. Hunterian. H. 7. Gastrocnemius and tendo Achillis "from a child," injected red, dried, and mounted in turpentine, showing the above. 7.8. The Structure of Tendon. Hunterian. H. 8. " A tendo Achillis to show the white silvery appearance of tendon. The fibres are all longitudinal, and parallel to one another." 7. 9. Arrangement of the Flexor Tendons in the Fingers. Hunterian. H. 9. A finger dissected and the tendon-sheath opened in its whole length, showing the splitting of the flexor sublimis digitorum {perforatus), and the passage through it of the tendon of the flexor profundus (perforans). 7.10. The Tendon Sheath in the Fingers. Hunterian. H. 10. A finger dissected, showing the above. "The ligamentary sheath removed only where thinnest." Note the broad strong bands opposite the first and second phalanges, and the narrow strong band opposite the interphalangeal joint with the thin areas above â€¢and below it, corresponding to the folds of the skin.

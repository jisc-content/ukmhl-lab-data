HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 188 7.20. The Blood-vessels of the Skin and Subcutaneous Areolar Tissue. Hunterian. F. 4. " A portion of the cutis injected red; its inside, as well as the cut edges, shows the cellular and adipose membrane exceedingly vascular." Dried and mounted in turpentine. 7.21. Deposition of Fat in the Omentum. Hunterian. F. 12. " The stomach, omentum, a portion of the transverse arch of the colon with the mesocolon, the spleen, and pancreas of a child, injected red. The transverse arch of the colon, etc., are allowed to fall lower than their natural situation, in order to stretch the omentum, and then show the first depositions of the fat along the sides of the blood-vessels of the omentum." 7.22. Deposition of Fat in the Omentum. Hunterian. F. 13. Portion of the omentum of a child, injected red, stretched on blue paper, showing the deposition of fat along the course of the blood-vessels. 7.23. Adipose Tissue from the Sperm Whale. Hunterian. F. 15. "A large portion of adipose membrane from the spermaceti whale. The oil does not appear globular, but seems to be contained in large fluid portions in irregular cells, like those of cellular membrane." William Hunter recognized that the cells in which fat Avas lodged were special cavities into which it was secreted, not merel)' the interstices of the areolar tissue, as many of his contemporaries supposed. Vide Introductory Note, before No. 7.16. 7.24. Adipose Tissue from the Sperm Whale. Hunterian. F. 15Â«. Similar to the preceding.

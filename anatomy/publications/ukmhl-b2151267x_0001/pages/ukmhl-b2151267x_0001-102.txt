HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 18 Also the centre in the anterior arch of the atlas just beginning to be visible. The bodies of the vertebrae are almost completely osseous. Shows also the intervertebral articulations. Compare Series 2, Joints. 1.83. Left Half of the Vertebral Column "of a Child of 7 or 8 months." Hunterian. N. 58a.d. The other half of the preceding. 1.84. The Vertebral Column "of a Child of 7 or 8 months." Hunterian. N. 58a.b. Carefully dissected. 1.85. The Vertebral Column of a Child "at 1 year old." Hunterian. N. 5Sb. Considerably larger than at birth. The centre for the anterior arch of the atlas is now quite distinct; ossification more advanced but still limited to the same centres; and the union of the laminae of the two sides to one another much firmer than at birth; it seems to be still cartilaginous in most. 1.86. The Vertebral Column of a " Child at 2 years old." Hunterian. N. 58c. Ossification has advanced very much further. The centres of the bodies and laminae much more extensive. The epiphyses of the transverse and spinous processes are cartilaginous. The cartilage at the line of junction of the body and the laminae is narrower. The arches of the laminae are completed by bone. A number of the epiphyses of the transverse processes have been broken ofi". The neural arches of the sacrum are mostly incomplete. Beautifully dissected, every scrap of periosteum and the capsules of the articula- tions removed. 1.87. Os Sacrum of a Child " between 2 and 3 years old." Hunterian. N. 145. Beautifully dissected. " Showing the progress of ossification and especially that the spinous processes of the os sacrum are not yet formed." The centre of ossification of the lateral mass of the first vertebra is large and separated from the body only by a thin plate of cartilage. '

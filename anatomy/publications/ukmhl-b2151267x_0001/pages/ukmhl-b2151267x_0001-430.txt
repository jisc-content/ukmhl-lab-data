346 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 23.8. The Conjunctiva, Puncta Lachrymalia, and Mei- bomian Glands. Hunterian. FF. 15. The left eyebrow and eyelids injected red. The secretion of the Meibomian glands is coagulated in the orifices of their ducts in little droplets; " the puncta lachrymalia very well seen towards the inner angle, with bristles in them." 23.9. The Conjunctiva and Puncta Lachrymalia. Hunterian. FF. 16. "The left eyelids beautifully injected from a young subject." The eyelids and conjunctiva complete over the cornea; the outer canthus divided, and the eyelids half inverted, to enable the inner canthus, with the puncta lachrymaha or orifices of the lachrymal ducts, to be shown. 23.10. The Conjunctiva and Puncta Lachrymalia. Hunterian. FF. 17. A similar preparation stretched on a glass globe the size of the eyeball, dried and mounted in turpentine. II. The Eyeball. (a) The Cornea, Sclerotic, Choroid, and Iris. 23.11. Horizontal Section of the Eyeball. Hunterian. FF. 18a. One half of an eyeball coarsely injected, and the humours and retina removed, showing the shape of the eyeball and its two outer coats. The external, consisting of the sclerotic and cornea, is thick and firm to maintain the shape of the organ and to protect the delicate structures within; the latter also modified in the way of transparency for purposes of vision. Lining the interior of this is the middle or vascular coat—the choroid, con- tinued in front as the iris, which hangs like a diaphragm in the anterior chamber, corresponding in size with the cornea. From the point of entrance of the optic nerve hangs the central artery of the inner coat or retina—the proper visual layer of the eyeball.

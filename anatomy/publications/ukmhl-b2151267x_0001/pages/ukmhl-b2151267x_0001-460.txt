376 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. carotid canal, and another bristle close to it indicates the tensor tympani muscle. The Eustachian tube could not be made out, but a little below the canal of the tensor tympani is seen a process of tumour tissue which is probably occupying it. On microscopic examination the tumour presents the structure of an epithelioma, consisting of irregular processes of epithelial cells, with numerous epithelial nests (laminated capsules) in them. The specimen gives no clear indication of the source from which the growth has sprung; but the condition of the inner part of the meatus externus, and the fact that it belongs to a class of tumour which grows from stratified epithelium, point to its having arisen from the inner part of the meatus externus, and to have burrowed inwards.

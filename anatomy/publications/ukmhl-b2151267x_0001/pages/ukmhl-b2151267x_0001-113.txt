DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOWER LIMB8. 29 1.151. Ossification of the Patella. Hunterian. N. 22. An ossifying patella about 2'3 cm. in diameter divided from side to side. There is a considerable amount of cartilage round the bony- centre, which is about 2 cm. across. In structure it is cancellated bone, slightly denser where it borders on the cartilage. 1.152. Ossification of the Patella. Hunterian. N. 20. A patella nearly fully ossified, about 2-7 cm. in diameter. In- jected red and in turpentine. It is split from back to front, and resembles the previous specimen but there is less cartilage. 1.153. Patella from an Adult; fully Ossified. Hunterian. iV. 21. Injected red and in turpentine. The articular cartilage is not perfectlj' cleared. 1.154. Ossification of Head of Tibia. Hunterian. N. 40. The head of the tibia, injected red and sliced horizontally into three sections, showing the ossification in the centre of the cartilage. Compare No. 1. 45. 1.155. Tibia and Fibula at about 2 years. Hunterian. N. 43. Injected red, broken almost in two, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing the centres of ossification in the epiphyses of the tibia, but none in those of the fibula. 1.156. Tibia and Fibula at about 2 years. Hunterian. N. 42. Similar to the preceding. Not broken. Injected red and in tur- pentine. 1.157. Ossification in Heads of Tibia and Fibula. Hunterian. iV^. 41. Heads of tibia and fibula from a considerably older subject, show- ing the epiphyses nearly all bone. Injected red and in turpentine.

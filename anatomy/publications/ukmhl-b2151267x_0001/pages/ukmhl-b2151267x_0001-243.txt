159 GOUTY ARTHRITIS. been ossified, is shown ; also to contrast it with the specimens Nos. 6.101-103 and 6.111, where the disease has been of the chronic inflammatory and senile degenerative type, and the ankylosis of the vertebrae is due chiefly to ossification of the ligaments. Its history is unknown, and so also is the cause of the disease. From what has been mentioned above, it appears most probable that it was some acute process of arthritis and osteitis, such as tubercular or septic disease, or a combination of the two. 6.42. Ankylosis of Radius, Carpus, and Metacarpals. H'unterian. Left radius, carpal bones, and metacarpals of the four fingers, probably from a grave, showing the above. The pisiform bone alone of the carpals is absent. They are fused together into a solid mass of cancellated bone with a fairly dense smooth outer shell, in which the lines of junctions of the several bones are not traceable, showing that the condition has been of very old standing. The ulna, first metacarpal, and pisiform have not shared in the ankylosis. The articular surfaces for them are fairly smooth, but, especially the second, distinctly increased in extent by osseous new- formation round their edges, after the manner of arthritis deformans. The surfaces of the distal ends of the metacarpals show slight traces of a similar condition. The hand has been fixed in a position of over-extension, to an angle of almost 40 degrees behind the straight line of the arm, and the carpus is decidedly displaced forwards. {d) Gouty Arthritis. 6.43. Gouty Arthritis. Hunterian. LL. 26. " A finger from a gouty hand ; a joint opened and bent on itself, to show the cartilages eroded a little." There is a slight degree of erosion and thinning around their edges. 6.44. Gouty Arthritis. Chalky Deposit. Hunterian. LL. 27a. A similar finger, showing " the joint invested everywhere with a thin layer of chalk." The cartilage has a dull creamy appearance,

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE EAR. 373 corresponding to the semicircular canals in man, and a fourth corresponding to the cochlea. That this last is meant to be cochlea is evident from its having a different entrance, which however is also ovalis, and not rotunda as in men." The cartilage alluded to as resting on the membrana tympani represents the incus and malleus. (C) RKPTILES. 25.34. The Vestibule and Semicircular Canals of a Turtle. Hunterian. HE. 26. The auditory nerve is attached to the vestibule. 25.35. Head of Lizard, showing the Ear. Hunterian. HH. 36. The membrana tympani is seen almost Hush with the skin, there being a very short external auditory meatus. It is situated very far back on the head, and almost in the same line as the mouth. 25.36. Head of Lizard, showing the Ear. Hunterian. HH. 37. The cranium laid open and the brain removed, showing the cavity of the ear and the Eustachian tubes. 25.37. Head of Lizard, showing the Ear. Hunterian. HH. 38. Similar to the preceding, from a different kind of lizard. (d) fish. 25.38. The Semicircular Canals. Codfish. Hunterian. HH. 33. The left auditory organ of a codfish dissected, showing the labyrinth, consisting of a very large vestibule containing a large white boat-shaped otolith, and three semicircular canals—one hori- zontal, the other two vertical—and set at about right angles to one another. They are bulbed at one end like in the mammal. The auditory nerve is visible on the inner side and ramifying over the vestibule and canals.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 70 B. Gunshot Injuries of Bone. 3.101. Encapsulation of Bullet in Bone and Fibrous Tissue. HunUrian. A round leaden musket-ball enclosed in a thin capsule of bone and fibrous tissue, cut in two, showing the above. The bone is a circular disc of rather larger diameter than the ball, covering one side (about a fourth) of it, and is continued at its edges into the fibrous capsule which envelops the remainder. The bone is from 2 to 4 mm. thick, porous and rather rough on the outside as if it had been attached to some osseous surface, which, however, could not be found in the collection. C. Comparative Pathology Specimens. 3.102. United Fracture at the Middle of the Femur of a Gorilla. Skeleton presented by Jolm White, M.D., 1865. Articulated skeleton in case in large hall of the Museum. The fracture has passed obliquely from without downwards, inwards, and rather forwards. The lower fragment is bent and rotated slightly inwards. The bones ride very little, and strong union has occurred with very little osseous formation and com- paratively little shortening and deformity. Contrast this with the Succeeding specimens. The animal was not full-grown, as the epiphyses are all quite distinct; the lower one of the fractured bone is amissing. 3.103. United Fracture of Radius and Ulna, "from a Sow." Ankylosis of the two Bones. Hunterian. Left radius and ulna macerated and dried, illustrating the above. Union has been effected by a huge mass of dense-looking bone, which has fused the four fragments of the two bones into a single piece. The line of the limb has been fairly well maintained. 3.104. Old Fracture of the Pelvis and Neck of the Femur in a Quadruped. Hunterian. Pelvis and several vertebrae macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The symphysis pubis has been broken away, and the

263 THE LYMPHATICS OF THE INTESTINES. 12.111. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Superficial and Deep. Turtle. Eunterian. QQ. 35. A portion of the intestine prepared in the same way as No. 12.106, and opened, showing the deep lymph spaces from the inside; the arteries injected red, the veins black, and the absorbents with mercury. In turpentine. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE INTESTINES IN FISHES. 12.112. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Turbot. Hunterian. QQ. 38. A portion of the intestine of the turbot injected with mercury, as described by Hewson, from branch to trunk; " these vessels in fish either have no valves or the valves readily give way, for it is an easy matter to fill them contrary to the course of the lymph." The deep plexus of vessels is seen in the lower part of the specimen. " The lacteals of the cod (and I presume in most other fish) are remarkable for having a beautiful network of vessels between the muscular and villous coat of the intestines. This network may be filled from the lacteals on the mesentery with the least force imaginable. If mercury be injected into this network at one part, it spreads over the intestine, the com- munications in the network being very numerous; if the intestine be inverted and the mercury squeezed, it is easily driven into the small vessels of the villi of the internal coat." As to this network, " it is made up of cylindrical vessels, and is not cellular as in the turtle, and therefore not in the least like an extra- vasation ; and in fish the vessels on the internal coat are larger than in the turtle." Compare No. 12.106. (Hewson's Warhs, p. 155.) 12.113. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Cod. Eunterian. QQ. 39. A small portion of the intestine and mesentery, the arteries injected red, the lymphatics with mercury. In turpentine. Most of the mercury has fallen out. As in the reptiles and amphibia, there are no lymphatic glands. (Hewson's Works, p. 154.)

THE VALVES OF THE HEART 203 10.25. Columna Carnea, "from a Bullock." Hunterian. S. 36. The columnae carneae are muscular processes passing from point to point of the inside of the ventricle, and giving it the fasciculated appearance mentioned in the description of No. 10.18. This one passed "between the two sides of the right ventricle." "The foramina Thebesii on the column injected with mercury, and communicating with the coronary veins." 10.26. The Aortic and Pulmonic Valves. Hunterian. £. Q. "The beginning of the aorta and pulmonary artery hardened in spirit in their distended state, whilst the blood is supposed to be attempting to get back into the heart. The preparation shows the loose edges of the sigmoid valves (semi-lunar) when in contact with another, almost totally shutting up the passage." The orifices of the coronary arteries are seen just above the valves of the aorta. 10.27. The Aortic and Pulmonic Valves, from below. Jeffray Collection. Roots of the above filled with injection, and the auriculo-ven- tricular septum. The edges of the three semi-lunar valves are tightly pressed together, forming a thoroughly competent valve. The sinuses of Valsalva above the valves are well brought out by the distention with the injecting fluid. 10.28. The Aortic Valve, from below. Hunterian. B. 6«. The root of the aorta distended with spirit till hard and dis- sected, showing the meeting of the three semi-lunar valves. It is known to be the aorta by the origins of the two coronary arteries. 10.29. Semi-lunar Valves of the Aorta. Hunterian. B. U. The root of the aorta, with part of the wall removed to show the semi-lunar valve opposite ind the small fibrous nodule in the middle of its edge, called globulus Arantianus or corpus Arantii.

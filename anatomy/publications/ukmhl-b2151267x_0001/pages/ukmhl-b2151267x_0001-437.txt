THE OPTIC NERVE AND RETINA. 353 23.42. The Eye of a Negro. Pigmentation. Hunterian. FF. 64rt. The eye of a negro divided longitudinally, and the vitreous humour, lens, and retina removed to show the depth of the pig- mentation both within and without the choroid. {d) The Optic Nerve, Retina, and Humours of the Eye. 23.43. The Optic Nerve and Retina. Hunterian. FF. 66. A longitudinal section of the eye, the vitreous humour removed, showing the optic nerve continuous with the retina ; the latter, a good deal torn, can be traced forward as a thin yellowish membrane nearly to the ciliary processes, where it becomes thin and indistinct. 23.44. The Retina. The Optic Disc. Hunterian. FF. 67. The posterior part of an ej'eball which has been divided trans versely, the vitreous humour removed, showing the retina with the optic nerve entrance a little to the inside of the eye, making a little cup (the optic disc) of a somewhat yellower colour than the surrounding parts. About 2 mm. to the outside (to the right, looking at the specimen as it hangs), on the same level, is seen a faint yellowish spot, which is the macula luteaâ€”the visual centre of the eye. 23.45. The Retina and Humours of the Eye. Hunterian. FF. 68. An eyeball, with the sclerotic, choroid, and pigmented layer removed, showing the retina enclosing the vitreous humour. The ciliary processes and cornea are also preserved. There is great distortion from shrinking of the vitreous humour by the spirit, and considerable tearing of the retina. 23.46. The Central Artery of the Retina. Hunterian. FF. 73. The posterior portion of an eyeball and the optic nerve finely injected ced, the vitreous humour removed. The branches of the central artery with the remains of the retina hang from the point of entrance of the optic nerve. The choroid is very finely injected. z

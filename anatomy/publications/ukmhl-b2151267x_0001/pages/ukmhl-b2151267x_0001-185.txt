101 INFLAMMATION OF BONE. 5.75. Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Sequestrum of almost the whole Diaphysis of Femur. Hunterian. Dried. The upper end and most of the surface is irregularly eroded. The lower end is rarefied as if there had been inflammation for some time prior to necrosis. The sequestrum must have ex- tended almost from epiphysis to epiphysis, and at nearly all points it includes practically the whole circumference of the bone. The medullary cavity is quite devoid of cancellous tissue. From a young subject. 5.76. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Hunterian. A considerable portion of the solid shell of the tibia with a little cancellous tissue inside. Dried. The front and inner aspect shows the natural surface of the bone charred in places, probably by application of the actual cautery with the intention of assisting the process of exfoliation. " As far as the power of caustic reaches so far do the parts become dead, and then the sound parts ad- joining to them inflame, suppurate, and cast them off as a slough." {Lectures, p. 253, MS. R.C.S.Eng., 42, c. 28.) Compare No. 5. 57. 5.77. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Hunterian. A large portion of the internal and external surfaces and anterior edge of a tibia, showing the usual characters of a sequestrum. Also blackened, probably by the application of the actual cautery. 5.78. Sequestra after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Hunterian. Two specimens of the above, showing the usual characters of sequestra of dense bone. The larger includes the whole circumference of the shaft of a femur. The other is small and blackened, probably by application of the actual cautery. 5.79. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis of the Clavicle. Hunterian. A sequestrum of the dense wall of the clavicle of a young subject, comprising in the middle the whole circumference of the bone and the long irregular tapered ends extending almost its whole length.

350 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 23.28. The Arteries of the Ciliary Processes and Iris. Huntericm. FF. 30a. Part of the choroid and the iris injected red, dried and mounted on a card in turpentine, showing the vessels of the choroid continued into the iris. Round the junction of choroid and iris is seen the greater vascular circle of the iris. On right and left it is joined by a larger vessel, the long ciliary arteries, which enter the back of the globe and run forwards along each side between the sclerotic and the choroid, and pass directly into the vascular circle by an upper and a lower branch. 23.29. The Arteries of the Choroid and Iris. Hunterian. FF. 31. Similar to No. 23.27. The injection has turned brown. 23.30. The Arteries of the Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 34. A portion of the posterior part of the eye ; also a choroid and iris, the sclerotic completely removed, finely injected red. 23.31. The Iris. Hunterian. FF. 37. An eyeball with the optic nerve of a child, the cornea removed, showing the iris finely injected red. With a lens the arteries can be seen running from the outer border inwards and forming a very close anastomosis round the pupillary edge of the irisâ€”lesser arterial circle of the iris. It appears very vascular. Compare No. 23.28. 23.32. The Choroid and Ciliary Processes. Hunterian. FF. 40. An eyeball coarsely injected red and divided transversely, the vitreous humour and lens removed and the outer coats inverted, showing the arteries of the choroid injected, but the injection not reaching the ciliary processes, which are seen as a circle of triangular folds of the choroid projecting inwards at its junction with the iris. 23.33. The Choroid and Ciliary Processes, and Arteries of the Iris. Hunterian. FF. 41. A similar preparation, but the halves not inverted. The injection is finer, and shows the ciliary processes to be exceedingly vascular.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 66 3.85. United Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula in the Lower Third. Ankylosis. Hunterian. Tibia and part of fibula, from a grave, showing the above. Evidently a very old fracture, and strongly mended, with ankylosis of the bones, and the foot somewhat displaced in an outward direction. 3.86. Fracture of Tibia and Fibula at the Junction of the Middle and Lower Thirds. United in bad position. Hunterian. Eight tibia with a splinter of the fibula, from a grave, showing the above. Both ends are imperfect. There is an extremely bad projection of the lower fragment in front of the upper. The medullary cavities have been closed by bone. The fibula, with the exception of a small detached splinter ankylosed to the upper fragment, is absent. 3.87. United Fracture of the Tibia at the Junction of the Lower and Middle Thirds. Process of Repair. Hunterian. Section of the lower half of the tibia, macerated and dried, showing the above. The fracture has been an oblique one, with overlapping of the ends. The medullary cavities are closed by cancellous tissue, but a new one is apparently being opened up by re-absorption of the internal new bone. 3.88. Old United Fracture of the Tibia in the Lower Third. Hunterian. Right tibia macerated and dried, perhaps from a graveyard, showing the above. A strong union in good position. 3.89. United Fracture of the Tibia in the Lower Third. Hunterian. Left tibia, probably from a grave, showing the above. A very good union, but with a considerable lump on the front of the shin. There is a square hole very like a pick mark on the head of the bone.

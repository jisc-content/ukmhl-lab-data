OSTEITIS IN GENERAL. 87 layers of the old dense shaft, which in the lower third of its length is quite thin, and, getting still thinner, finally disappears near the lower end, where the rarefying osteitis has passed clean through it and invaded the new-formed dense bone outside. The history of the bone is unknown. The cause of the condition was probably a very chronic suppurative osteomyelitis. 5. 43a. Chronic Osteomyelitis of Femur. Hunterian. Anterior section of the preceding bone. (2) Changes of Bone due to Inflammation of the neighbouring Soft Parts. 5.44. Osseous Outgrowths on Fibula associated with Chronic Ulcer. Hunterian. Head of right fibula macerated aud dried, illustrating the above. The history of the specimen is unknown ; but it is covered with bony outgrowths, especially along the lines of attachment of the interosseous membranes and muscles, very similar to what is seen in cases of chronic ulcer of the leg. It has been catalogued accordingly after comparison with specimens of known antecedents in other collections. (3) Inflammation of Bone'produced hy Pus-forming Organisms. (a) where the organisms have reached the bone through THE circulation : ACUTE SUPPURATIVE (INFECTIVE) OSTEO- MYELITIS AND PERIOSTITIS. {a) Where the Destructive Process is advancing. 5.45. Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis of Upper End of the Tibia. Rarefaction. Hunterian. Left tibia macerated and dried. An example of juxta-epiphysial osteomyelitis, the chief seat of the disease being in the neighbour- hood of the epiphysis, which is absent, possibly having been detached in maceration, but very probably by the disease. The disease has

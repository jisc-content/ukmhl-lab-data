DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOWER LIMBS. 27 cartilages have shrunk considerably. A single centre of ossification is seen in both epiphyses, that in the lower being the larger. Comparing it with the preceding, note how the bone of the shaft has extended up into the neck and the position of the centre of ossification in the articular head. Compare No. 1. 44. 1.140. Femur of a Child about 2 years old. Hunterian. N. 34. Injected red, broken almost in two, dried and mounted in turpen- tine, showing a centre of ossification in the epiphysis at each end of the bone. 1.141. Femur of a Child about 2 years old. Hunterian. N. 35. A similar femur showing the centre of ossification in the upper epiphysis. In turpentine. 1.142. Ossification of Upper End of Femur. Hunterian. N. 37a. The upper end of the femur " from a young person " (over 6 years old at least). Injected red and in turpentine. The head of the bone is divided vertically and one half removed, showing the epiphysis forming the articular head only. The bone of the shaft has formed the whole of the neck and intertrochanteric region. There is a distinct centre of ossification for the great trochanter, which is enclosed in a thin cartilage. The bone is sawn nearly through at the level of the lesser trochanter and bent to show its internal cancellated structi;re. The bone composing the head is seen to be of similar structure. Compare No. 1. 8. 1.143. Lower End of the Femur at about 6 years. Hunterian. N. 36. Shows the lower epiphysis almost entirely osseous, but covered all over by cartilage and with the epiphysial line well marked. The cancellated structure of the end of the shaft is seen in the section. 1.144. Lower End of Femur of a Young Adult. Hunterian. N. 37. The posterior half of the above, divided longitudinally. The epiphysial line well marked and the head covered with cartilage all round, showing that growth was not complete. Injected red.

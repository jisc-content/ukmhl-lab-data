251 THE LYMPHATICS OF THE STOMACH. across them here and there. In addition, there is visible, through the transparent muscular wall, a system of lymphatic spaces con- nected with one another by finer channels; some of these are in the mucous coat, as they appear plainly from the inside ; others, which are as indistinct from the one side as from the other, probably in the submucous areolar tissue. A beautiful preparation. 12.60. The Lymphatics of the Stomach. Skate. Hunterian. QQ. 53. The lymphatics on the stomach itself are not injected, but the fringe of omentum hanging from the lower curvature is traversed by numerous lymphatic vessels injected with mercury. 12.61. The Lymphatics of the Stomach. Skate. Hunterian. QQ. 54. The specimen consists of a portion of the wall of the stomach near one of its orifices, the serous surface outwards. The tur- pentine in which it is mounted gives it a transparency like horn, rendering visible two plexuses of lymphaticsâ€”(1) superficial, running in the subserous connective tissue; and (2) deep, visible from the mucous as well as from the serous surface, running in the sub- mucous connective tissue and communicating with the former. In the wall of the viscus are also to be seen numbers of parasitic nematodes lying in the submucous connective tissue (as was determined when the specimen was being remounted). 12.62. The Lymphatics of the Stomach. Skate. Hunterian. QQ. 55. The whole stomach injected, the arteries red, the lymphatics with mercury, dried, and varnished. It is very black, and a great deal of mercury has escaped, and is sweating out at all points still. Shows that the lymphatics run round the viscus like the arteries and veins. 12.63. The Lymphatics of the Stomach. Skate. Hunterian. QQ. 56. Similar to No. 12.61, but includes the whole girth of the organ (a small one). There is an abundant network of super-

217 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. bend of the elbow due to wounding the brachial artery in the opera- tion of blood-letting. It consisted in cutting down on the vessel, passing a hare-lip pin through the lips of the wound in it, and bringing them together with a ligature twisted round the ends of the pin, as for hare-lip. {Med. Obs. and Inq., Vol. II., p. 360.) III. and IV. Changes associated with Conditions affecting THE Nutrition, and with Inflammatory and Degenera- tive Disease of the Arteries. William Hunter recognized two diseases of the arteries : a soften- ing and opacity of the inner coat and an " ossification," which two â– conditions he regarded as closely allied. It is clear from his descriptions and specimens, that these diseases included atheroma, calcareous infiltration of atheromatous patches, and also calcareous infiltration of the middle coats of the arteries, but he did not recognize the difference between the two last-named conditions. The following specimens were formerly described as ossification of arteries; but, to avoid confusion, they are now all described as atheroma, showing its different stages, or as calcareous infiltra- tion of the middle coat. (a) Atheroma. 11.26. Atheroma of the Aorta. Slight. Opacity and Thickening of the Intima. Hunterian. B. 20. " The three coats of a section of the aorta. The inner coat is in most places opaque, and, as it were, clouded, showing the beginning of ossification." The outer coat is dissected upwards, the middle downwards. The intima, with some fibres of the media in the middle, shows the above conditions. See note on Dr. Hunter's views of diseases of the arteries. 11.27. Slight Atheroma of the Aorta. Hunterian. B. 37. The beginning of the aorta, with the inner coat of the artery a little thickened above the valves.

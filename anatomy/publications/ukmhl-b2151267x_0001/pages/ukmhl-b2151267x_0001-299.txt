215 ENDOCARDITIS. mitral valve is quite disorganized, and must have been incom- petent. There are a few calcareous patches in the semi-lunar valves of the aorta. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. 11., No. 4.) 11.21. Chronic Endocarditis. Funnel-shaped Deformity of the Mitral Valve. Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The mitral curtains and chordae tendineae are fused together into a funnel-like diaphragm, and the orifice contracted to a small oval hole less than 1 cm. in its largest diameter; there are also one or two minute holes beside the main passage. From above, several projecting vegetations are seen on the surface of the valve. SECTION II. THE ARTERIES. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. Specimens wanted. See Nos. 10.36 to 38. II. Changes resulting from Injuries of Arteries. (a) The Results of Ligature. 11.22. " The Femoral Artery after Amputation." Oblitera- tion by Ligature. Hunterian. A. 13&, Both artery and vein are tied in the old styleâ€”with several threads of ordinary twine, which were probably waxed, though no trace of wax remains now. The artery is laid open, and is seen to be filled with blood-clot up to the first branch. It is also somewhat contracted. Compare No. 11.51, Aneurism showing Obstruction of Artery by Atheroma. 11.23.

The ligatures have separated, doubtless by suppuration, and have been removed, leaving the ends of the vessels matted to- gether and completely occluded by fibrous tissue. The clot, as

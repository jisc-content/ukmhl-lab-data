183 ANKYLOSIS OF THE SPINE. Comparative Pathology. 6. 111. Ankylosis of the Spine of an Old Horse. Presented by Professor Young. Ten vertebrae, lumbar and dorsal, of an old horse, macerated and dried. They are welded together into one rigid mass, in a manner similar to the preceding human vertebrae, 6.101, seq. As in those there are plates rising from the edges of the bodies and bridging over the intervertebral spaces, and ossification of the anterior common ligaments. The laminae are also extensively fused together by ossification of the ligaments between them. There does not appear to be ankylosis across the articulations between the vertebral bodies. The spinous processes are imperfect. The animal was a quarry horse at Luss, Dumbartonshire, N.B., and had for years carried heavy loads of stone on its back. 6.112. Ankylosis of the Spine of an Old Horse. Presented by Professor Young. Four lumbar vertebrae from the same horse. They are united by ossification around the articular processes and between the arches, and by three thick, rather narrow plates of dense bone, each uniting two of the bodies; these last are situated alternately on either side of the spine close to the transverse processes. 6.113. Ankylosis of the Spine of an Old Horse. Presented by Professor Young. Two dorsal vertebrae from the same animal, united only by a bridge of bone on the side of one of the joints of the articular processes.

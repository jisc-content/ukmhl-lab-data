284 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 17.16. The Rima Glottidis. Hunterian. GG. 48. The larynx hung horizontally, so that it can be looked into from either end. From above (considering it in the natural position) the false cords, with the openings of the sacculi laryngis, appear somewhat indistinctly; below them the true cords, whiter and less dull, form the boundaries of the narrow chink—the rima glottidis. From below is seen the wide round cavity of the trachea narrow- ing to the rima glottidis. The cords are in about the middle position—between that of full separation, as in free breathing, and that of approximation, as for phonation. 17.17. The Framework of the Vocal and Respiratory Passages. Hunterian. T. 12. The liyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid car- tilages, and the trachea and bronchi for a little way into the lungs, partly macerated and cleaned. " A beautiful preparation : the branches of the bronchial artery are seen on the lower part; before, the trachea is principally cartilaginous; behind, mem- branous." 17.18. The Vocal and Respiratory Passages and the Oesophagus. Hunterian. T. 13. A dissection of the same parts not so completely cleaned, " with the oesophagus and pharynx hardened in spirits in its natural situation." 17.19. The Hyoid Bone and Cartilages of the Larynx. Hunterian. T. 15. " The larynx from an adult, with the os hyoides: in a fore view are seen the epiglottis above, next the os hyoides, then the thyroid cartilage, and lowest the narrow part of the cricoid. Behind the principal objects are the arytenoid cartilages standing on the basis of the cricoid," with the minute cartilages of Santorini on their apices. The epiglottis is deeply pitted for the reception of mucous glands. 17.20. The Hyoid Bone and Thyroid and Cricoid Carti- lages. Hunterian. T. 16 Similar to the preceding, "from a child," the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages wanting.

182 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 6.106. Ankylosis of Vertebrae and Costo-vertebral Articu- lation. Hunterian. Four upper dorsal vertebrae and part of a rib, from a grave, showing the above. The fragment is very rotten, doubtless long buried. The vertebrae are ankylosed, partly by plates between the edges of the bodies, partly by fusion of the cancellous tissues by ossification through the intervertebral discs. The bond of union is all cancellous bone. A section has been made of the rib into the transverse process and body of the vertebra. The cancellous tissues of the three are continuous, a thin line of slightly denser tissue marking the seats of the obliterated joints. 6.107. Ankylosis of Sacro-iliac Articulation. Hunterian. An entire male pelvis, probably from a grave, showing firm ankylosis between the left ilium and the sacrum by a thick plate of dense new bone bridging over the whole upper border of the joint for a width of 6 cm. There are also bony outgrowths from the edges of the upper surface of the body of the sacrum and along the iliac crests, and ossifications of the cotyloid ligaments of the hip- joints. 6.108. Ankylosis of Sacro iliac Articulation. Hunterian. Sacrum and left innominate bone from a grave, showing the above; similar to the preceding. The right joint has also been ankylosed by a thick bridge of new bone over the top. 6.109. Ankylosis of Sacro iliac Articulation. Hunterian. Sacrum and right ilium, a very rotten graveyard fragment, show- ing ankylosis by a plate of new bone across the front and part of the top of the sacro-iliac joint. 6.110. Ankylosis of Sacro iliac Articulation. Hunterian. Right innominate bone and part of the lateral mass of the sacrum, from a grave, united by plates of new bone all round the articular surface, and by fusion, not quite complete, of the cancellous tissues across the joint.

290 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 17.54. The Bronchial Artery. Calf. Hunterian. T. 34. The lungs of a foetal calf macerated and cleaned till only the bronchi and its branches remain. The bronchial artery was injected red, and its branches are now visible running on the walls of the bronchi. 17.55. The Bronchial Artery. Calf. Hunterian. T. 34e. "A portion of the bronchi near the surface of the lungs in a slink calf, after maceration; the branches of the bronchial artery curling along those of the trachea are extremely beautiful." 17.56. The Bronchial Artery and Nerves of the Lungs. Calf. Hunterian. T. Md. A similar preparation, with the nerves preserved and indicated by bristles. They are seen accompanying the branches of the bronchial artery. 17.57. The Bronchi and Bronchial Artery Mammal. Hunterian. A portion of the lung of some mammal, injected red bj' the pulmonary artery, slightly macerated, and the bronchus and its branches partly cleared. Branches of the bronchial artery, also injected red, are seen running on the bronchus. 17.58. The Ultimate Air Vesicles. Antelope. Hunterian. On the jar is scratched "T. 31, antelope," but there is no description corresponding. The specimen consists of a small piece of lung into which mercury has been run through the trachea^ then dried and mounted in turpentine. The mercury has flowed into the ultimate air vesicles rather overdistending them. Where the edge of the lung is thin and transparent, the relation of the air vesicles to the bronchioles can be seen, each bronchiole ter- minating in a little cluster of vesicles.

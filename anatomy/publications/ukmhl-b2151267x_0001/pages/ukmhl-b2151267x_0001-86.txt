HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 2 The new order, it is expected, will be found more convenient, and further, it accords much better with that of William Hunter's Anatomy Lectures than did the old order. Both series are rather incomplete. There were several adult skeletons and a collection of bones from a young adult to show the fully formed epiphyses, but they are no longer in the museum. These, and the numerous preparations of joints which might with advantage be added, it is hoped to supply in the future. A. Structure of Bones in General. Structure and Varieties of Bones. 1.1. The Inorganic Portion of Bone. J. H. T. 1897. Lower end and parts of the shaft of a human femur from which the organic portions have been burnt away. Where the roasting has been complete the bone is white like a piece of limestone; where it has been incomplete the charred remains of organic matter give it a black colour. The compact outer layer of the bone has split in various directions, showing the internal cancellous tissue. The removal of the organic matter renders the porosity of every part of the bone clearly visible. Dry. 1.2. Organic Portion of Bone. Hunterian. N. 133. Two ribs injected red and decalcified by steeping in dilute acid. The result is to leave the organic matrix—a flexible porous tissue preserving the shape of the original bone—what Dr. Hunter terms in his Lectures (MS. RC.S.Eng., 42. c. 28, p. 196) "the skeleton of a bone; that is, the vascular part of a bone deprived of its earthy matter." The one is split and partly teased to show its fibrous structure, and the other is tied in a knot to show its tough- ness and flexibility. This specimen corresponds to I, No. 9, of the original MS. cata- logue. It was supposed to be amissing, and is therefore not described in the 1840 catalogue. 1. 3. Shaft of a Long Bone. Hunterian. I. 3. Portion of the shaft of a femur, divided longitudinally, macerated by being "long exposed to the weather." Shows the hollow

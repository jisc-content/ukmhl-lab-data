INJURIES OF BONE. 69 3.97. Recent Fracture of the Tibia. Process of Repair. Hunterian. LL. 53. Inner section of the left tibia showing the above. Shows the ends of the fragments enclosed in a thick mass of soft tissue—pro- visional callus—of periosteal origin. There is similar soft tissue between the ends of the fragments. 3. 98. Comparatively Recent Fracture of the Fibula. Pro- cess of Repair. Hunterian. LL. 39. Longitudinal section of fibula illustrating the above. The frac- ture, which has been transverse, was probably between two and three weeks old when the specimen was obtained. The ends are in close apposition, with the line of fracture quite distinct; the edges are sharp, but the surfaces of the shaft are not very distinct, owing to the presence of the bony callus on the outside. This is about 3 mm. thick at its thickest point (opposite the fracture), making a spindle-shaped swelling, which acts hke a splint to the fragments. The medullary cavity is occupied by a plug of fairly dense osseous callus, extending only about 1 cm. up and down. 3.99. United Fractures of the Fibula. Hunterian. A group of seven fibulae macerated and dried, illustrating the different seats of fractures of this bone, ranging from just below the head down to 6 or 7 cm. from the lower end, which is the usual seat in a Pott's fracture. 3.100. Comparatively Recent United Fracture of the Fibula about the Middle. Riding of the Frag- ments. Hunterian. Portion of left fibula macerated and dried, showing the above. The fracture has passed nearly transversely. The fragments meet at an angle of about 10° off the straight, the upper end of the lower fragment lying in front and outside of the upper, and overlapping it about 2 cm. The medullary' cavity is not closed.

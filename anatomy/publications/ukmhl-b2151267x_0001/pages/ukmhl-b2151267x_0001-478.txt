394 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 28.16. Sarcoma of the Back. Hunterian. II. 63. A tumour, about 7 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. thick, of irregu- larly round shape, and somewhat lobulated, with an oval piece of skin, which has been excised with it. On section, the tumour looks like gland, with a good deal of fibrous tissue, and on micro- scopic examination is found to be a sarcoma, with a very well developed stroma. The cells have to a very large extent atrophied. Formerly described as " a tumour, which Dr. Hunter formerly extirpated from between the scapulae in a man; it looks glandular; the disease recurred, proved cancerous, and killed." (MS. Notes, J.H.T., J). 41.) END OF VOL. I.

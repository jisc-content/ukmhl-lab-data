THE SPINAL CORD. 313 and bristles put under the upper and lower ends of the filum terminale. 21.6. The Spinal Cord, Membranes, and Blood-vessels. Hunterian. E. 16a. The vertebral column " of a child," the bodies and spinous pro- cesses removed, and the lateral masses drawn somewhat apart to show the above. The arteries are injected red. The dura mater is left behind and removed in front, and its cavity is seen to extend down to the top of the sacrum. The cervical and lumbar enlarge- ments, the anterior roots of the nerves and their passage through the dura mater to the intervertebral foramina, the termination of the cord about the level of the tirst lumbar vertebra, and the Cauda equina are well displayed. The anterior spinal artery is seen running a serpentine course along the pia mater opposite the anterior median fissure. Rising above from the vertebral arteries, and reinforced by branches from the intercostals and lumbars, especially those of the left side, it forms an anastomosis the whole length of the cord. 21.7. The Pia Mater and Arteries of the Spinal Cord. Hunterian. E. 166. The spinal cord "of a child," the dura mater removed, the arteries injected red. At the top are seen the vertebral arteries uniting to form the basilar, and from one of these rises the upper part of the anterior spinal. In turpentine. 21.8. The Blood-vessels of the Spinal Cord. Hunterian. E. 17. The spinal cord " of a child," age not stated, the dura mater removed before and behind, but not at the sides. The arteries are injected red, the veins blue. The plexus of veins which lies between the dura mater and the periosteum of the vertebrae is seen on the dura mater about the roots of the nerves. On the cord the veins accompany the arteries. 21.9. The Arteries of the Spinal Cord. Hunterian. E. 18. The spinal cord " of a child," the arteries alone injected, the dura mater opened before and behind to show the above.

195 STUMPS AFTER AMPUTATIONS. V. Results of Operation. Stumps after Amputations. 9.11. Section of Bone from a Stump. Hunterian. LL. 9. Decalcified, dried, and mounted in turpentine. Formerly de- scribed as " a longitudinal section of callus injected very red." The lower end is swollen out into a rounded knob of cancellous bone new formed around the sawn end. There is a considerable number of blood-vessels in it. At one side there is a whitish, nearly avascular portion, apparently a sequestrum. The ampu- tating saw-cut in this specimen has been transverse. Contrast specimens Nos. 9.15 to 9.18, in which it has been oblique. 9.12. Section of Bone from a Stump. Hunterian. LL. 11. Another section of the same. 9.13. Bone from a Stump, Hunterian. A portion of the shaft of a femur macerated and dried. The end of the old shaft is rounded off and covered with a mass of new- formed bone, which materially increases its breadth. The medul- lary cavity is not well closed. Probably the limb was not properly healed. 9.14. Bone from an Old Healed Stump of the Leg. Hunterian. The head and a small portion of the shaft of a tibia, from a stump, after amputation a little below the knee. The saw-cut has been transverse. The corners are well rounded off. There is a little irregularity of the new bone over the end. Macerated and dried. 9.15. Bone from an Old Stump. Hunterian. A portion of the shaft of a long bone, femur apparently, mace- rated and dried. The edges are bevelled off, especially in front, and the medullary cavity sealed with a thin plate of bone. This plate is dense as if old, but it is incomplete, there being a small perforation in the centre. The end is not appreciably enlarged. The saw-cut

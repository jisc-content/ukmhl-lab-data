SERIES 4. INJURIES OF JOINTS. 4.1. Old Unreduced Subcoracoid Dislocation of the Hume- rus. Formation of False Joint. Ilunteriau. Right scapula and humerus macerated and dried, illustrating the above. There is a cord from the humerus to the acromion, which allows the bones to come into apposition with the back of the head of the humerus, resting on a facet formed by new bony outgrowth on the neck of the scapula below the coracoid process. The articular surface of the humerus is increased by bony outgrowth round the posterior edge of the head, in a manner which adapts it to the new facet on the scapula. The edges of the glenoid facet are rounded as if by atrophy, and the anterior edge is ground down by the movements of the displaced bone. The dislocation must have been of very long duration, and the new joint must have allowed a fair amount of movement. From a subject which was being used for operations on the dead body. Vide Med. Obs. and Inq., Vol. II., p. 351, Plate III., fig. 3. 4.2. Humerus from an Old Unreduced Dislocation back- wards. Hunterian. Right humerus macerated and dried, showing the face of the head, which looks forwards and inwards, worn down to a flat eburnated surface, which was probably a new articular facet corresponding to the dorsum of the scapula. 4.3. Unreduced Dislocation of the Thumb at the Meta- carpo-phalangeal Joint. Hunterian. LL. 35. Dissection of "a thumb, dislocated from its first bone, which had never been reduced, but allowed to remain.

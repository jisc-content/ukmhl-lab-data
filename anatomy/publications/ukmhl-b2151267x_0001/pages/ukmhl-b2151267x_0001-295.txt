211 PERICARDITIS. 11.4. Rupture of the Heart. Spontaneous. H'unterian. S. 55. "A portion of the right ventricle of the heart of an old man who married his maid, and died suddenly the first night after; the ventricle appears ruptured large enough to admit one's thumb." The seat of the rupture is just at the apex. The heart is loaded with fat on the outside; the muscle is extremely brittle, which may, however, be the result of the long immersion in spirit. Microscopic examination for the same reason gives no definite information. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 36.) The muscle at the point of rupture is fairly thick for a right ventricle. 11.5. Acute Pericarditis. Fibrinous Exudation on the " The right ventricle of the heart of an adult who died in Westminster Hospital, covered externally with a very thick crust of coagulated lymph." The shaggy appearance of the fibrinous crust is very characteristic. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. I., fig. 2.) 11.6. Acute Pericarditis. Fibrinous Exudation on the IV.

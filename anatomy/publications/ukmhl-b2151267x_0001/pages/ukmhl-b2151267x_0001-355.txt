GLANDS. 271 14.3. The Vascularity of Glands. Kidney. Malpighian Bodies. Hunterian. G. 7. " A slice of the surface of a kidney so minutely injected (red)^ that the coloured size thrown in by the artery returned by the ureter. The cryptae (Malpighian bodies) of anatomists here appear to be either convolutions of the extreme branches of the artery, or if they are bags to be entirely covered with the convolutions of the artery. The small branches are broken, but the cr3q5tae {Malpighian bodies) are very evident." Mounted on mica in tur pentine. 14.4. The Vascularity of Glands. Kidney. Hunterian. X. 28. Section of the cortex of a kidney injected red to illustrate the high vascularity of secretory organs. (6) Ducts. 14. 5. Excretory Ducts. Tubuli Uriniferi. Kidney. Horse. Htmterian. G. 10, A portion of the kidney of the horse, with the uriniferous tubules injected red from the pelvis; as an example "of the most simple kind of excretory duct." " They are exceedingly distinct at their terminations, and two or three of them are seen uniting to form a larger one before they reach the pelvis. This sufficiently distinguishes them from arteries and veins. The injection has not run far enough to fill the cryptae." A magnifying glass is almost necessary for the appreciation of these points. 14.6. Excretory Duct. Submaxillary Gland. Hunterian. GG. 14a. The excretory duct of the submaxillary gland, its whole length preserved, injected with mercury, showing its branches and the lobulated structure of the gland. In turpentine. 14.7. Excretory Duct. Submaxillary Gland. Hunterian, G. 21. Similar to the preceding. In turpentine.

187 THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES. of increase and decay in every part"; (2) that the fat was lodged in vesicles of its own, not in the interstices of the areolar tissue; (3) demonstration of the sweat ducts, proving that sweating is not a mere filtration of fluid through the interstices of the skin, but a proper secretion. The views expressed there, so far as they go, show his usual accuracy. 7.16. Structure of Areolar Tissue, Hunterian. F. 2. Portion of the areolar tissue of the scrotum inflated, dried, and mounted in turpentine. 7.17. Structure of Areolar (Connective) Tissues. Hunterian. F. 3. "One-half of the scrotum of a child; the cellular membrane (areolar or connective tissue) was distended from oedema; in this state it was hardened in spirits and then divided. There is no appearance in any of the foregoing preparations of regular cells; the tissue seems rather to consist of very fine laminae of a white cotton-like colour, interwoven so as to form a kind of sponge, all the parts of which are seen to communicate with one another from tlie enlarged size of the parts thus distended. The cellular membrane appears very ductile, and of course must allow of parts moving easily on one another." 7.18. The Interstices of the Areolar Tissues. Hunterian. F. â€”. A portion of areolar tissue, probably scrotum, which has had its interstices distended with mercury, and, after hardening, been split open. The size of the spaces is exaggerated by the mode of preparation. 7.19. The Septum of the Scrotum and its Blood-vessels. Hunterian. F. 17. Part of the scrotum of a child, injected red, dried, and mounted in turpentine, showing the above.

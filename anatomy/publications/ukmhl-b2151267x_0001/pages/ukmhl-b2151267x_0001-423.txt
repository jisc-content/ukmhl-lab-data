339 DISEASES OF THE SPINAL CORD. 22.24. Spina Bifida. Syringocele. Hunferian. EE. 52. The right half of the lower part of the trunk of a foetus, injected red, showing the above. The spina bifida has been divided into two fairly equal portions (see also next specimen.) From behind there is very little tumour; only a somewhat elevated ring of skin surrounding a diamond-shaped area about 2 cm. long by 1'5 cm. wide, the floor of which, considerably below the level of the ring of skin, consists of soft vascular membrane. In section, this soft membrane is seen to be the outer wall of a cavity, which, before the section was made, was enclosed all round by a similar soft tissue. The cavity in this, and perhaps more distinctly in the succeeding, is traceable up the centre of the spinal cord— clearly a syringocele. The anterior wall of the syringocele is separated from the bodies of the vertebrae by a space—a slight distension of the subdural (arachnoid) space—across which the nerves are seen passing from the cord to the intervertebral foramina. The lumbar and sacral plexuses are dissected, and are seen to be fully developed, and arranged quite in the normal manner. There is a tuft of hair at the lower edge of the raised ring of skin. 22.25. Spina Bifida. Syringocele. Eunterian. EE. 53. The other half of the preceding. The anterior wall of the sac of the syringocele is pushed back by bristles to show the nerve roots. II. Injuries of the Spinal Cord. Specimens wanted. III. Changes due to Conditions Affecting the Nutrition AND Various Local Causes : Haemorrhage, etc. Specimens wanted. IV. Changes due to Inflammatory Disease. Specimens wanted.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 374 25.39. The Auditory Organ of the Codfish. Hunterian. HH. 34. The labyrinth full}' dissected out, showing the vestibule and semicircular canals. In front of the vestibule is a small bulb, which is the representative of the cochlea. 25.40. The Auditory Organ of the "Kingston" or Angel- fish. Htmterian. HH. 28. Part of the cranium, which is cartilaginous, dissected, showing the large vestibule opened and containing some "black sand"â€” otoliths; there are three semicircular canals bulbed at one end, and bristles indicate a pair of nerves entering two of these bulbs. Inside the cranial cavity the corresponding nerve roots are visible. (Squalus Squatina. Monk-fish.) 25.41. The Auditory Organ of the Angel-fish. Hunterian. HH. 27 (?). Labelled IIH.25, but does not correspond to description; prob- ably HH.27, which is amissing. It resembles the preceding. A bristle is placed in the meatus auditorius externus. 25.42. The Auditory Organ of the "Kingston" or Angel- fish. Hunterian. HH. 29. Similar to No. 25.40, but smaller. 25.43. The Auditory Nerve of the " Kingston " or Angel- fish. Hunterian. HH. 30. "Before it enters the vestibulum, like a diverging cone of rays." 25.44. The Auditory Organ of the Thornback Skate. Hunterian. HH. 32. " The entrance of the nerves into the bulbs of the canals is remarkably distinct; vestibulum is filled with a tremulous jelly, which coagulates like the crystalline of the eye in spirits. The canals are accidentally demonstrated to be tubes, from some particles of the coagulable jelly having got into them in inflating the vesti- bulum." The organ as a whole is very similar to the preceding.

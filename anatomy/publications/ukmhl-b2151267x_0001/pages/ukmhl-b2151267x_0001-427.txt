" The popliteal artery with sciatic nerve, both eroded from an ulcer after amputation (suppuration), in which there was constant pain. The nerve is more than three parts of its thickness eroded. The artery had bled a little, but above the place where it burst is seen plugged with an exceedingly firm coagulum of blood." Illustrates the converse of the preceding, viz. that when sup- puration does get into a nerve from a wound of the sheath, it affects it in much the same way as other parts. The artery is split, and one part turned down showing its interior. V. Tumours of Nerves.

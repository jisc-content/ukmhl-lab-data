122 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. cavity in the neighbourhood of the node is filled up with widely cancellous bone, which is decidedly vascular. " The node resembles much the callus of bone (about a fracture), and is also evidently vascular." 5.147. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. Lower portion of the tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. Its surface nearly all over is composed of rough new bone, dense but with abundant channels for blood-vessels. It has been sawn longitudinally to show, as in the preceding, the new bone formed on the exterior of the old ; chiefly over the crest and on the inner and outer surfaces. There has also been new-formation of can- cellous, bone internally, narrowing the medullary cavity. Where the new bone is thickest, there has been a rarefying osteitis of the old dense shell, converting it into cancellous bone. The old shell is traceable in front only, about the upper and lower ends. Probably syphilitic. 5.148. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. A large tibia macerated and dried, showing considerable thicken- ing of the shaft, mostly on the back, by old chronic periostitis. Pro- bably syphilitic. Near the lower end behind there is also a patch of recently-formed new bone. 5.149. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Htmterian. A large tibia and fibula macerated and dried. A very good pair for the preceding, and showing a very similar enlargementâ€”on the, tibia, mostly behind and in the lower half; on the fibula, pretty well all round its lower two thirds. A patch near the lower end is of more recent date. Probably syphilitic. 5.150. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia and Fibula. Hunterian. A tibia and fibula macerated and dried, showing a condition very similar to the preceding, but the enlargement is considerably greater and also more general. The new bone is firm and smooth,.

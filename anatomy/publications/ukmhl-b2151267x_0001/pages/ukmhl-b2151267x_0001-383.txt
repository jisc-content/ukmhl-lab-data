299 DISEASES OF THE AIR PASSAGES. terior half is turned down to show the coagulable lymph (diphtheritic exudation), plugging up the trachea entirely," and extending even into the bronchi. 18.16. Diphtheritic Exudation from the Trachea. Ex- pectorated. Hunterian. T. 72. " Two pieces of coagulable lymph putting on the appearance of tubes coughed up from the lungs" â€” two pieces of false membrane forming tubular casts of the trachea and beginning of the bronchi. Compare No. 18.24, Fibrinous Casts of the Bronchi. Figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. II., PI. II., fig. 2. V. Tumours of the Respiratory Passages. 18.17. Mucous Polypi of the Nose. Hunterian. GG. 55a. "The right side of the face, cavity of the nose seen on the one side, and antrum of Highmore laid open on the other. Two polypi are seen hanging in the cavity of the nose, under os turbinatum superius (middle turbinate bone), and covering the passage into the antrum. The membrane of the antrum is thickened into a similar substance, as if the polypous disposition had spread over its whole extent." The mucous membrane of the lower turbinate is also thickened and oedematous. 18.18. Carcinoma of the Larynx. Jeffray Collection, 104. A note on the jar says, "Larynx, destroyed by ulceration. The voice was rendered hoarse and deglutition difficult, leading to a suspicion of stricture of the oesophagus." The specimen hangs by the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue. The ulcera- tion is confined to the inside of the larynx; the epiglottis is completely, and the false cords partly destroyed; the true cords are unajBfected except at their posterior ends, where there is some thickening of the mucous membrane. Microscopic examination unsatisfactory : appears to be a carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 59.)

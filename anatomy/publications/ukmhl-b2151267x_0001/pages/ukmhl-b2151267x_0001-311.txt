227 ANEURISM. the top of the arch an aneurism, about the size of a tangerine orange, rises and projects upwards and outwards into the upper lobe of the left lung, which is considerably compressed. The lung containing the sac and the bronchus of the lobe are laid open, and a black rod passed from the sac through one of the smaller bronchi into the main bronchus shows the manner in which the case terminated. The branch of the bronchus actually opened is quite a small one. Beside this aneurism, and communi- cating with it by a hole in the partition between them, rises another aneurism which separates the two carotids and presses on their origins; it communicates freely with the aorta. This aneurism is partly filled with firm coagulum; the one which burst contains only a few flakes of soft fibrin. 11.54. Aneurism of the Descending Aorta. Hunterian. KK. 8. " A section of the superior portion of the aorta from its origin out of the heart to its passage through the diaphragm. Just as it passes the root of the lungs it dilates into an aneurismal sac â– capable of containing one's fist. The orifice leading from the aorta into this cavity is about one half inch (12 mm.) long and one inch (25 mm.) broad, making an oval; it had formed a bed for itself in the posterior side of both lobes of the lungs, and was at first sight mistaken for a vomica (phthisical cavity) by the pupils (case unknown)." 11.55. Aneurism of the Descending Aorta. Hunterian. KK. 9. The other half of the preceding specimen, with a portion of the lungs still adhering. It contains a thin lining of fibrin. 11.56. Portion of a Dissecting Aneurism of the Abdominal Aorta. Hunterian. KK. 14. "The whole aorta descendens aneurismal, and divided into two longitudinal portions ; its diameter every way about three inches {about 7'5 cm.), especially about the middle; it became less going downwards. From the dissecting room." The specimen <!onsists of the lesser portion of the aneurism. The tunica intima

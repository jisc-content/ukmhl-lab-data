GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 13 1.56. Ossification in Membrane. Hunterian. A parietal and the two halves of a frontal bone of a foetus, injected red, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing the radial arrange- ment of the osseous fibres, and the high vascularity of developing bone. 1.57. First appearance of Ossification. Hunterian. BR. 298. An embryo about 32 mm. long from the top of the head to the end of the buttocks, probably early in the third month, showing a very early stage of ossification. Mounted as usual in spirit, it is remark- ably transparent, and shows the ossifications clearly. There are centres in the clavicles (where they are largest, and extend fully, half of the length of the bones), humerus, radius, and ulna, femur, tibia, upper and lower jaw. The vertebral column is unossified, except for two narrow streaks in the lumbar region, which look like the commencement. There is also a faint trace of ossification in the occipital bone. B. Development of the Skeleton and Particular Bones. The Whole Skeleton. 1.58. Skeleton of a "Foetus at 3 months." Hunterian. N. 135. Cleaned, dried, and mounted in turpentine. Very imperfect. 1.59. Skeleton of a "Foetus at 3| months." Hunterian. N. 136. A very small skeleton for three and a half months. It is beautifully dissected, and shows the amount of osseous material laid down at this period. The shafts of all the long bones are osseous, the epiphyses apparently all entirely cartilaginous. In most of the vertebrae there are three centres of ossification : one in the body and one in each lamina. Vault of skull and lower jaw absent. 1.60. Skeleton of a Foetus at about 6 months. Hunterian. N. 141. (Not described.) Injected red, the soft parts, except the liga- ments, carefully removed, dried, and mounted in turpentine.

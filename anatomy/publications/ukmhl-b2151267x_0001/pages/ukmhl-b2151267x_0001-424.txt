340 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. V. Tumours of the Spinal Cord and its Meninges. 22.26. Sarcoma Infiltrating the Dura Mater of the Spinal Cord. Haemorrhage. Hunterian. EE. 46. "A portion of adult spinal marrow, with a tumour, size of a large filbert, adhering: the cause of palsy of the lower extremities (Dr. Knox)." The reference could not be traced. The tumour is outside the dura mater and adhering to it. It is encapsuled in fibrous tissue (derived apparently from the connective tissue between the dura mater and the periosteum). It is very ragged, and probably most of the proper tumour tissue has been washed away in the preparation of the specimen. On microscopic examina- tion of a slice taken from the outer surface of the growth, it is found to have a distinct fibrous capsule (just inside which a large haemorrhage has occurred), and to consist of masses of round and oval nuclei with very little trace of cell protoplasm or intercellular tissue, separated by strands of fibrous tissue similar to the capsule. It is a sarcoma infiltrating the dura mater of the spinal cord. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 43.) SECTION III THE NER VES. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. Specimens wanted. II.

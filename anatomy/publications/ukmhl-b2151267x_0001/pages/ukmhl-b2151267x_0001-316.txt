â€¢232 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 11.69. Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Partly dis- sected. Hunkrian. KK. 18. The clot is firmer than the last, but the laminae are easily separable. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. IV., fig. 1.) 11.70. Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 19. 11.71. Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 30. Dense and firm, but has been partly dissected into its original laminae. 11.72. Old Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 23. Very dense and fleshy, but showing distinctly that it has been formed in concentric lamellae. 11.73. Old Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 22. 11.74. Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 26. The outer layers are very dense, but inside some of the clot has a more recent appearance. Besides the usual white thrombus there are some brown streaks, which indicate that the red corpuscles have been included in the coagulation. 11.75. Laminated Coagulum from an Aneurism. Hunterian. KK. 25. Part of the sac is included in the specimen, and at the lower part of the section the thrombus is very intimately united with it, as if organization were proceeding in its outer layers.

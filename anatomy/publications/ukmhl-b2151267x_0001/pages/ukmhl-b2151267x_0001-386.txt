302 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. scattered through the lung, which have nowhere undergone caseation. They are recognized from the surrounding tissue, which appears to be consolidated by some process of the nature of pneumonia, by their more homogeneous and solid appearance and slightly deeper brown colour. In the lower part of the specimen there is a haemorrhage. There are a few minute flakes of fibrin on the pleura. The larger blood-vessels are injected red. 18.28. Tuberculosis of the Lungs. Phthisis Pulmonalis. Stage of Caseation. Hunterian. T. 81. A section of lung crowded from top to bottom with caseating tubercles, here and there showing signs of breaking down, and a few small cavities. The pleura is covered with fibrinâ€”a secondary pleurisy. 18.29. Tuberculosis of the Lungs. Phthisis Pulmonalis. Formation of Cavity. Hunteriav. T. 81a. A small portion of lung with numerous caseous tubercles, and breaking down into a large ragged cavity. 18.30. Tuberculosis of the Lungs. Phthisis Pulmonalis. Hunterian. T. 78b. " A large branch of the trachea cut open, which communicated with a collection of pus near the lower part of the lungs." A mass of caseating tubercles is also seen near the root of the lung. Most of the surrounding pulmonary tissue appears healthy. 18.31. Tuberculosis of the Lungs. Cavities. "Empyema." Hunterian. T. 76. A portion of the outer surface of one of the lungs, with parts of the adjacent ribs, injected red, showing the above. There are a number of cavities, mostly very near the surface of the lung. Slough- ing of the pleura had occurred over two of these, leaving oval perforations (about 10 mm. by 5 mm.), and leading to empyema, probably with pneumothorax. The lower part of the lung is covered by a thick exudation, which had become partly organized (as is shown by the presence of injected blood-vessels), and firmly united

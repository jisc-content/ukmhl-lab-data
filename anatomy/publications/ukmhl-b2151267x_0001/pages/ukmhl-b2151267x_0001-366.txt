The Nasal Fossae and Adjacent Structures. Hmderian. GG. 43. A similar section, a little higher up, and with the lateral masses remaining. The cavity of the nose is clearer than in the preceding, and the mucous membrane smoother. The antra are opened from below, and bristles placed in their nasal orifices. The nasal ducts can be clearly seen opening into the inferior meatus well forward. Two other bristles occupy the Eustachian tubes. From above, the anterior ethmoid cells being opened, a bristle is passed by the orifice of the right one into the middle meatus, appearing at the front of the nose. Another bristle passed from the left frontal sinus by the infundibulum into the middle meatus appears at the back of the nose. The pharyngeal tonsil is smaller, and presents a foliated appearance. 17.10. The Cavities of the Nose. Hunterian. GG. 7. A transverse vertical section of the nose in the line of the anterior bicuspid teeth, showing sections of the middle and inferior turbinate bones and the nasal passages. Bristles passed from before show how high the cavity of the nose extends. Shows also the thickness of the mucous membrane. Injected red. 17.11. The Cavities of the Nose. Hunterian. GG. 10. A similar section showing the same structures; the mucous membrane over both turbinates and the lower part of the septum on the right side is considerably thickened. Bristles indicate the openings of the nasal ducts into the inferior meatus, and of the infundibula into the middle meatus. The frontal sinuses are opened from above. Injected red. 17.12.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 76 In the Hunterian MSS. and old printed Catalogue there is no particular description of the dry diseased bones. The following descriptions, and also those of dry specimens in the next Series, are therefore, for the most j)art, entirely new. See Preface. I. Abnormalities in Growth or Development. 5.1. Bones of the Leg and Foot of a Dwarf. Hunterian. Macerated, dried, and articulated. The history of the bones is not known. From the fact that there is no trace remaining of the epiphysial lines it is evident that they were taken from an adult, though the tibia is only 17'5 cm. long. The foot is large in pro- portion to the leg bones. The normal curves and ridges are exaggerated, but not in a manner suggestive of rickets. The long bones are dense and polished on the surface. II. Changes Produced by Conditions Affecting the Nutrition of Bone. (1) Atrophies of Bone. 5. 2. Atrophy of Bone. Hunterian. A tibia macerated, dried, and divided longitudinally, showing the above. The Haversian canals of the dense wall of the shaft are increased in size till they resemble the spaces of the cancellous tissue. This has occurred especially inside, producing the appear- ance of an increase in the cancellated bone and consequent thinning of the outer dense shell. The cancellous tissue of the ends also appears unduly porous. Compare Rarefying Osteitis, Nos. 5. 40 and 5.45 to 5.51. 5.3. Normal Structure of a Long Bone. Hunterian. A femur macerated, dried, and divided longitudinally, showing the appearance and the relative amount of the dense and cancellous tissue in a normal bone; for comparison with the preceding and other diseased bones.

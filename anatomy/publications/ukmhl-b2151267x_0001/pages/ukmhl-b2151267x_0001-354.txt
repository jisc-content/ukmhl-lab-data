SERIES 14. ANATOMY OF GLANDS. Vascularitij of Glands, ...... 1-4 Duds, 5-9 Intestinal Glands, ....... 10 Shape of Glands, . . . . . . .11-14 Tlie specimens in this series were intended by William Hunter to illustrate some of the characters of glands in generalâ€”their various shapes, their ducts, and their high vascularity. Glands are also illustrated more fully in various of the other series. William Hunter's views regarding secretion are alluded to in the Historical Introduction. (a) Specimens illustrating their Vascularity. 14.1. The Vascularity of Glands. Human Liver. Hunterian. G. 4. A slice of the liver injected red so highly as to appear as if entirely made up of vessels; illustrating the high vascularity of glands. 14.2. The Vascularity of the Spleen. Hunterian. G. 5. The structure and functions of the spleen being quite unknown in William Hunter's time, it was classed with the glands simply because its flesh ("parenchyma") was soft and highly vascular. The specimen is injected red and teased to show "the extremities of the arteries terminating in groups of very minute short branches named penicilli."

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 26 1.135. Ossification of the Innominate Bone "at Birth." Huntericm. TV. 67. An innominate bune, finely injected red, and sliced in various directions to show the interior of the flattened spongy bones which form the os innominatum. The spicules of bone in the ilium radiate from a centre near the neck of the bone. Portions of the sacrum are also present. 1.136. Innominate Bone and Femur "at 12 months." Huntenan. N. 110. Beautifully cleaned and injected red. 1.137. Innominate Bones "between 2 and 3 years." Hunterian. N. lib. The two innominate bones corresponding to the sacrum No. 87, beautifully cleansed of the soft tissues, showing the three primary ossifications considerably developed. That of the ischium appears in the floor of the acetabulum in a considerable area corresponding with the cotyloid notch and depression for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. That of the ilium has also appeared in the floor of the acetabulum. The cartilage separating the three ossifications as seen from the outside is now reduced to a Y-shaped piece with fairly thick limbs. 1.138. The Innominate Bone and Femur "at 12 months." Hunterian. N. llOtt. Similar to the preceding, but not injected. The upper and lower epiphyses of the femur are split longitudinally showing their shape and extent and that there is as yet no centre of ossification in the former, but a small one in the latter. From the condition of the epiphyses and size of the bones the "12 months" probably means the third month of extra-uterine life. Compare the next specimen. 1.139. Ossification of the Epiphyses of the Femur. Hunterian. N. 32a. Femur of a child of about a year, injected red, divided longitudinally and the anterior portion dried and mounted in turpentine. Tlie

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 17 1.79. Centres of Ossification in the Vertebrae. Hwnterian. N. 57. "The longitudinal half of four vertebrae of the neck." "The ossified body of one of the vertebrae is half turned out of its bed of cartilage, like a kernel from a nutshell, in another it is entirely removed, and in a third it remains in situ." 1.80. Ossification of Sacrum in a "Child of 1 month." Hwnterian. N. 58. A longitudinal section of the bodies of the sacrum, last lumbar vertebrae, and coccyx, showing the development of the first- mentioned from five distinct centres of ossification, representing five vertebral bodies, which afterwards become fused into one bone. The five masses of cartilage containing the centres of ossification are separated by distinct interarticular fibro-cartilages, similar to those of other articulations of the spine, but narrower and with less of a central soft pulp. The cartilage at the anterior and posterior edges of the articulations also appears to have more of the hyaline and less of the fibrous character than that at the corresponding point in the joint between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. The coccyx is composed of three cartilaginous vertebral bodies in which no ossification has yet appeared. Compare No. 1. 87. It is finely injected red. 1.81. Vertebral Column from a "Child at Birth." Hunterian. N. 58a. Carefully dissected. The bodies are ossified to a considerable extent; the centres in the laminae have extended forwards into the bodies and backwards into the arches till they almost meet. The anterior centre of the atlas is not visible. The first and second sacral vertebrae present five centres, one for the body, one for each lamina, and one for each lateral mass. 1.82. Right Half of the Vertebral Column " of a Child of 7 or 8 months." Hunterian. N. 58a.c. Dissected and divided longitudinally. Shows the centre in the body of the axis, and the separate centre for the odontoid process. B

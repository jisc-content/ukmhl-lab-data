255 THE LYMPHATICS OF THE INTESTINES. 12.79. The Lymphatics of the Intestines. Hunterian. QQ. 11. A portion of the intestine with the mesentery, showing several lacteals injected with mercury, terminating in mesenteric (lym- phatic) glands. The lymphatics divide and reunite on the mesentery. The mercury has escaped from several of the lacteals on the intestine. In turpentine. 12.80. The Lymphatics of the Intestines. Lacteals. Hunterian. QQ. 16. " Absorbent rising out of the human intestine, filled with mercury and exceeding small: the mesentery was cancerous; and the obstruction made, perhaps, the smallest vessels visible." The Comparative Anatomy of the Lacteals. 12.81. The Lymphatics of the Intestines. Antelope. Hunterian. D. 2. " A portion of the small intestines and mesentery of an antelope, in which the absorbents are still preserved in the state they were found in the dead body, i.e. full of their own chyle. The arteries and veins both injected red." The lymphatics are seen to end in a large lymphatic gland in the centre of the specimen. 12.82. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Antelope. Hunterian. QQ. 21. The arteries not injected, otherwise similar to the preceding, the lacteals appearing to be injected white from being filled with coagulated chyle. 12.83. The Lymphatics of the Intestine and Mesenteric Glands. Kitten. Hunterian. D. 5%. " A portion of intestine and mesentery from the kitten, showing, in the course of the arteries and veins, small lacteal vessels and small oval bodies, most probably absorbent glands." On blue paper.

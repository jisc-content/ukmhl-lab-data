212 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 11.10. Acute Pericarditis. Hunterian. S. 72. Similar to the preceding. 11.11. Acute Pericarditis. Commencing Organization in the Fibrinous Exudation. Hunterian. S. 75. The fibrinous crust has been peeled up from the surface of the left ventricle of the heart. The specimen has been injected blue, and innumerable blue points on the deep surface of the crust show where blood-vessels and other organizing elements had begun to sprout into the fibrin from the pericardial tissues. " The coronary arteries were injected, and the inflammatory crust afterwards peeled off' and turned up, in which vessels injected are distinctly seen in many places, proving the living principle of this lymph or blood." (Description of S. 73 in. MS. Catalogue.) 11.12. Acute Pericarditis. Commencing Organization in the Fibrinous Exudation. Hunterian. S. 74. A portion of the auricle of the same heart as the preceding. 11.13. Acute Pericarditis. Commencing Organization in the Fibrinous Exudation. Hunterian. S. 76. Injected red; similar to No. 11.11. The deep layer of the crust shows red pointsâ€”the new-formed blood-vessels. Some of the injection also appears on the free surface of the fibrinous crust; on examination with a lens, this appears to be in small blood-vessels, although this part of the crust must have been of very recent formation. 11.14. Acute Pericarditis. Organization proceeding in the Crust. Hunterian. S. 63 The heart is highly injected red; and where the fibrinous crust is turned down, its deeper layer, still adhering to the ventricle, and also the deep surface of the freed layer show areas of injec- tion and even distinct blood-vessels in one or two places. There is a distinct reddish colour on the face of the crust, which, as in previous specimen, is due to the presence of the vermilion injection

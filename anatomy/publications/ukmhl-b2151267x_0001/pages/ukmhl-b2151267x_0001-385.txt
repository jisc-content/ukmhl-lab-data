Fibrous Adhesions of the Pleura. Himterian. F. 8. "Portions of two distinct lobes of the lungs, united by an adhesion in consequence of inflammation." The lobes, as the result of a pleurisy, have been glued together by fibrin, which has been organ- ized and replaced by a band of vascular fibrous tissue. The blood- vessels are rendered visible by injection with vermilion. 18.23. Fibrous Adhesions of the Pleura. Huntenan. F. l\. Similar to the preceding, stretched on a piece of lead. 18.24. Fibrinous Casts of the Bronchi. Expectorated. Hunterian. T. 69. " Coughed up from the lungs." The origin of such casts is obscure. Tuberculosis of the Lungs: Phthisis Pulmonalis. 18.25. Miliary Tubercles in the Lungs. Hunterian. T. 78a. "A portion of the lungs, on the surface of which the small beginnings of tubercles are seen ; some of them are certainly cheesy, like the scrofulous absorbent glands." (Compare Nos. 13.2 to 13.4, Tuberculosis of Lymphatic Glands.) The pleura has been cut away over the tubercles, which are very small and few in number. 18.26. Miliary Tubercles in the Lungs. Hunterian. T. 79. " A small slice of lung, showing abundance of small tubercles. The lymphatics on the outside of the lung injected with mercury." 18.27. Miliary Tubercles in the Lungs. Pneumonic Con- solidation. Hunterian. T. 80. " A large portion of tubercles, universal, and making the lungs as solid as a piece of liver." There are numerous minute tubercles

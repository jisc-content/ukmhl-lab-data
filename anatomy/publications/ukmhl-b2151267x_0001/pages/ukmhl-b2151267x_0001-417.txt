DISEASES OF THE BRAIN. 333 22. 6. " Diseased Brain." Huntericm. EE. 29. " A portion of diseased brain to show inflammation of the cortical substance. (Case unknown, dissecting-room.)" (6) Tuberculosis and Syphilis of the Brain. 22.7. Tubercular Nodules of the Brain. Huntericm. EE. 26a. " Five tubercules strung upon a tliread; they are hard and of the scrofulous kind; found in the brain of a child injected for blood-vesselsâ€”the largest as big as a walnut, the smallest like a very large pea." Microscopic examination shows that, like most of the specimens described as " scrofulous " in the former catalogue, they are tubercular neoplasms, and consist of tubercles and caseous material, with a good deal of firm fibrous tissue. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 48.) 22.8. Tubercular Growth in the Pons Varolii. Huntericm. EE. 30. Part of the medulla, crura cerebelli, and crura cerebri, and the pons Varolii, which has been sliced parallel to the medulla, and the under portion turned up. The whole of the pons is occupied by the new growth, consisting of strands of firm tissue, with friable breaking-down material between, and a capsule similar in texture to the firm strands. On microscopic examination the supposed capsule is found to be the remains of the lower layers of the pons; the rest consists of bands of recent tubercles, with caseous material between them. Formerly described as " Sup- puration of the tuberculum annulare, producing palsy of the upper extremities with some hydrocephalic symptoms, and killing in about two months." ("Dr. Cooper's case wrote out and drawn.") (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 49.) 22.9. Gumma of the Pia Mater. Huntericm. EE. 25a. The new growth consists of a sort of membrane adherent to the dura mater, and replacing the pia mater, with a number of nodules of irregular size and shape, which must have lain in hollows on the surface of the brain. It is injected red, and the vessels of the dura mater and fringes of pia mater are seen to

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 10 1.39. Vascularity of Cranial Bone. Hmterian. I. 13. Occipital bone injected red, stripped of periosteum, decalcified and cleared in turpentine. Blood-vessels visible in all parts of it, but most abundant where the diploe is abundant, and in the cancellous basilar and articular processes. These parts by reflected light are of a bright vermilion colour, which shows the richness of their blood supply. 1.40. Vascularity of the Vault of the Cranium. Hunterian. I. 26. " The upper part of the cranium injected red to considerable minuteness with the pericranium, which is at one part reflected upwards : from an adult." Most of the vessels are in the peri- cranium. Decalcified and cleared in turpentine. 1.41. Vascularity of the Vault of the Skull. Jeffrmj Collection. Upper part of the cranium of a child, with the dura mater and pericranium, finely injected red, showing the richness of the blood supply of these parts. 1.42. The Bone Marrow. Hunterian. I. 20. Longitudinal section of the upper half of the tibia of an adolescent subject, finely injected red, showing the disposition of the marrow in the medullary cavity and cancellous tissue. Also the vascularity of it and of the cancellous and compact bone. " We are certain that the compact substance of bones has not only vessels going in every part from its external surface, but we also know that in most bones there is a pretty large branch of a vessel" (the nutrient artery) " enters at one hole, which goes chiefly to the cancelli and marrow, but also gives branches to the compact substance of bone ramifying from withinwards." (Lectures, p. 192, MS. R.C.S.Eng., 42. c. 28.) Growth and Development of Bone. 1.43. Epiphysis of Long Bones. Hunterian. N. 24. "The tibia of a child from which the epiphysis at each end is half pulled off", to give an idea of epiphysis."

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 74 ends are quite covered over with a membranous substance, which, however, is loose, as it covers the central parts." Dislocation has been backwards and outwards. 4.4. Unreduced Dislocation of the Femur; Facet for New Joint. Hunterian. Right ilium (femur absent) macerated and dried. Appears to have been a case of dislocation of the head of the femur on to the dorsum of the ilium, where a new osseous socket has been in process of formation. The acetabulum is partly filled up, and its edges atrophied. A-. 5. Atrophy and Filling"-up of the Acetabulum consequent on Absence of the Head of the Femur. Hunterian. There is no history of the case, and there is no sign of the head of the bone having rested elsewhere on the ilium; but the filling- up and atrophy of the edges of the acetabulum resemble what is seen in the previous specimen. Possibly the sequel of amputation at the hip.

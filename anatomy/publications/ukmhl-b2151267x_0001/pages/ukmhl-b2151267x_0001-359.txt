275 THE SPLEEN. in bunches (penicilli) of fine vessels which open into the sinuses of the pulp. Compare Nos. 15.5 and 15.10. 15.5. The Trabeculae and Blood-vessels of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 4. 'â–  The spleen of an adult (rather small), the arteries injected red, and the capsule removed, macerated in water." The pulp has been pressed out and washed away, leaving only the tough fibrous sponge-like framework and the blood-vessels, which are seen dividing into bunches (penicilli) of fine arterioles floating free in the spirit. 15.6. The Blood-vessels of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 4a. The spleen "of a child," highly injected red, macerated; the trabeculae and the blood-vessels in them finely unravelled; the branching of the arteries beautifully displayed. A magnifying glass is required to see it properly. Comparative Anatomy Specimens. 15.7. The Trabecular Framework and Blood-vessels of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 6. The spleen of a calf, with the capsule removed off' one side, macerated in water so as to remove all the pulp. It shows the trabeculae and the course and distribution of the larger blood- vessels. A few Malpighian bodies can be seen on the arteries. 15.8. The Trabecular Framework and Blood-vessels of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 7. A similar specimen, but injected red bj^ the artery, which enables the trabeculae to be distinguished from the blood-vessels, and shows the tufts (penicilli or pencils) of fine vessels into which each artery divides. The Malpighian bodies on the arteries can occasionally be detected. 15.9. The Trabeculae, Arteries, and Malpighian Bodies of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 8. A similar preparation, but with the whole capsule removed. The masses of adenoid tissue in the sheaths of the arteries, called

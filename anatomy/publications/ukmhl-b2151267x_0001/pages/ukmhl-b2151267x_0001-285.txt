THE ANATOMY OF TEE HEART. 201 (c) The Anatomy of the Heart. 10.18. Heart dissected to show the Cavities and Valves, Huntcrian. S". 12. The heart of an adult man (" Hoquet") injected red, hardened in spirit, and afterwards dissected, to show the above. The auricles have been removed at the auriculo-ventricular groove, and the aorta and pulmonary artery cut off short to exhibit the four valves of the heart, viz. : the tricuspid and mitral preventing the return of the blood from the ventricles into the right and left auricles respectively; a,nd the sigmoid or semi-lunar valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery preventing the return of the blood from the arteries into the ventricles. The walls of the ventricles have also been cut away to show their internal fasciculated structure and the chordae tendineae and musculi papillares of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The left ventricle is recognized by the greater thickness of its muscular wall. The coronary arteries, supplying blood to the heart, are seen rising from the aorta a little way above the semi-lunar valves. 10.19. Dissection of the Heart "of a Boy about Twelve Years old." Hunterian. S. 13. " Filled with size, hardened in spirit, and then cut open and the size removed to show the internal structure of the auricles and ventricles with the exit of the great vessels." 10.20. The Heart of an Adult Man: Dissected. Hunterian. S. I3a. Similar to No. 15 ; but the auricles have been very carefully dis- sected, and only part cut away, so as to preserve their outlines and their relations to the great vessels. The cavities of the ventricles are exhibited as in the preceding specimen. Comparative Anatomy Specimens. 10.21. Heart of Bird. Hunterian. No description. It is of a type similar to the mammalian heart, having two auricles and two completely separate ventricular cavities. The ventricles are laid open, and bristles placed in the aorta and pulmonary artery. The auricles are intact.

102 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 5.80. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis of the Inferior Maxilla. Hunterian. A large sequestrum of almost one half of the above, including the articular head. For the most part the bone shows the charac- teristic pitted or eroded appearance, but here and there on the body and over the articular process the original surface of the bone is present. There are also one or two rarefied areas, as if inflammation had produced some changes in that way before the necrosis occurred. Most of the teeth had been absent, and their sockets filled up. 5.81. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Trephine Holes. Hunterian. A considerable sequestrum of the front of the tibia, showing two trephine holes and a smaller drilled hole. One of the former had reached the medullary cavity. Compare 5. 69 and 5. 70. 5.82. Sequestrum after Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis. Trephine Marks. Hunterian. A considerable sequestrum, 14 cm. long, of almost the entire circumference of the tibia for part of its length, showing on the inner anterior surface several superficial trephine marks and other cuts. (b) inflammation of bone due to pus-forming organisms which have reached it through wounds of the adjacent soft parts. (a) Disease of Bone Secondary to Ulcers. 5.83. Osteitis due to an Ulcer invading the Bone. New- Formation followed by Rarefaction. Hunterian. Lower two-thirds of tibia and fibula macerated and dried. The inner surface of the lower third of the tibia and the outer surface of the corresponding part of the fibula are covered with a flat sharply-defined crust of porous bone. These crusts are fully 5 mm. thick. They are slightly hollowed on the surface; the raised edges are of roughly circular outline and slightly overhang the adjacent sound bone and interosseous space. In position and shape these

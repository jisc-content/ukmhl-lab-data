326 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. the system of Willis), the 7th and 8th being marked together as the 7th, and the 9th, 10th, and 11th as the 8th. The carotid arteries are seen beside the optic chiasma. 21.53. The Cranial Nerves at their Exits through the Dura Mater. Hunterian. EE. 15. The greater part of the base of the skull of a child, injected red, showing the above. The optic chiasma has been removed, showing the infundibulum in the centre and the ends of the carotid arteries giving off the ophthalmic arteries, which pass into the optic foramina below and to the outside of the nerves— seen best on the right side. 21.54. The Olfactory Nerves—the First Pair. Hunterian. E. 23c. The mucous membrane of the outer and inner walls of the right fossa of the nose, the branches of the olfactory nerve dissected to show their passage through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and their distribution in the mucous mem- brane of the nose. (The shape of the inferior turbinate bone, preserved in its mucous membrane, gives the key to the relations of the different parts of the specimen.) Probably this is the original specimen alluded to in John Hunter's paper " On the Nerves of the Organ of Smelling," published in Animal Oeconomy, as being "shown by Dr. Hunter in his courses of anatomy." 21.55. The Olfactory Nerves—the First Pair. Hunterian. E. 23e. Part of the mucous membrane of the upper region of the nasal fossae, the branches of the olfactory nerves dissected to show their distribution. 21.56. The Optic Nerves. Decussation. Hunterian. E. 30. The optic chiasma, the nerves partially dissected, showing their fibres, some of which appear to decussate. The union of the two nerves in the chiasma is connected with the performance of co-ordinated actions of the two eyes.

ATROPHIES OF BONE. 77 5.4. Senile Changes in the Femur. Eunferian. Eight femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The bone is very light; externally more porous than normal. Compare the preceding. The natural curve forwards of the shaft is exaggerated. The head of the bone reaches above the level of the top of the great trochanter, the neck being set at a decidedly less open angle to the shaft, and being also shorter than in the normal bone. (2) Alterations due to Conditions apparently Constitutional, but more or less Obscure. (a) rickets. 5.5. Distortion of the Sternum due to Rickets. Hunterian. Sternum macerated and dried, showing the above. The body of the sternum is convex forwards and considerably wider than normal. From an old subject. 5.6. Distortion of the Sternum due to Rickets. Hunterian.^ Sternum macerated and dried, showing the above. Similar to the preceding. 5.7. Distortion of the Sternum due to Rickets. Hunterian. Sternum and costal cartilages cleaned, dried, and varnished, showing the above. There is slight anterior convexity of the body, and the manubrium and the xiphoid process are both bent strongly backwards. 5.8. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Hunterian. Eight femur of a young subject macerated and dried, showing the above. The chief deformity is a curve markedly forwards and slightly outwards in the upper and middle thirds. The ends show little or no thickening. The bone is unduly porous. There has been a great increase of the bony ridge of the linea aspera, so as to fill up the concavity of the curve. The shaft accordingly appears flattened from side to side, measuring only 1-2 cm. in that diameter, but 2-5 in the direction of the curve; it is doubtful if there is anj^ actual flattening.

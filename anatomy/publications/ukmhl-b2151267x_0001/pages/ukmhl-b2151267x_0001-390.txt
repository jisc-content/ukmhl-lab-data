SERIES 19. THE THYROID AND THYMUS GLANDS AND SUPRARENAL CAPSULE. Thyroid Gland, 1-3 Thymus Gland, ........ 4 Suprarenal Capsule, ....... 5-14 19.1. The Thyroid Gland. Hunterian. GG. 52. Dissection of the thyroid gland and larynx " of a woman," to show the former in situ. The two lobes lie on the sides of the thyroid cartilage and trachea, united by the isthmus, which crosses the trachea just below the cricoid cartilage. The narrow process of gland running up from the isthmus towards the hyoid bone is a remnant of the diverticulum of the pharynx, from which the gland was developed. Its other end is seen at the root of the tongue as the foramen caecum (see Series 31). The remains of this structure occasionally give rise to cysts in the middle line of the neck. It is usually described as the obliterated duct of the thyroid gland. 19.2. The Thyroid Gland of a Child. Hunterian. GG. 53. Similar to the preceding. Also shows the median process ex- tending upwards from the isthmus. Injected red. Appears to be extremely vascular. 19. 3. The Thyroid Gland. Adult. Hunterian. GG. 53a. Similar to the preceding, but larger; injected red. No trace of the obliterated duct.

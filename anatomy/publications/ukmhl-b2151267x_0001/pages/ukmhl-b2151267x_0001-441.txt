COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE EYE. 357 23. 65. Eye of Sea Cow (Sirenia). Hunterian. FF. -lie. A similar specimen, but the pigment is almost completely wanting. 23.66. Eye of "Neel Ghaw" (Nylgau). Hunterian. FF. 79. Divided transversely, and the humours and retina removed. The internal surface of the choroid is of an iridescent white colour—a structure called tapetum lucidum, which collects the light and enables animals to see in the dark. There is pigment in the outer layers of the choroid and in the ciliary processes and iris. 23.67. Eye of Bullock. Hunterian. FF. 48. Injected red, and the anterior part of the sclerotic and the cornea removed, showing the arteries of the choroid and iris beautifully injected. The ciliary nerves are also displayed on the outside of the choroid. The shape of the pupil is a long oblong rounded at the corners. 23.68. Eye of Bullock. The Choroid and Ciliary Pro- cesses. Hunterian. FF. 43. The anterior half of the eye, vitreous and lens removed, showing the arteries of the choroid and ciliary processes finely injected. 23.69. The Choroid, Ciliary Processes, and Iris. Bullock. Hunterian. FF. 4G. The sclerotic, choroid, and iris of a bullock's eye inverted, and hanging by the optic nerve ; the arteries injected red. The ciliary processes appear to be highly vascular. 23. 70. Eye of Calf. Hunterian. FF. 69«. The outer coats dissected from one another, showing the ciliary processes, the iridescent tapetum lucidum, and the remains of the retina and retinal vessels hanging from the optic nerve.

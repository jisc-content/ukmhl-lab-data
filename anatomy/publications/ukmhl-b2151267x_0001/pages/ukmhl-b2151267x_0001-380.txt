296 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 1 cm. of the base of the vomer can be seen in the median line, showing the extent to which the hard palate had failed to unite with it. 18. 5. Incomplete Cleft Palate. Hunterian. GG. 61. A similar preparation from an older child. The failure to unite is more extensive, including about half of the hard as well as the soft palate. The septum nasi also appears defective, only a ridge on the roof of the naso-pharynx being seen through the cleft. The tongue has almost got behind the palate. 18.6. Cleft Palate and Single Harelip. Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The head of a very young foetus, showing the above. The defect is on the left side entirely, the right half of the palate and the vomer having united completely. The cleft involves lip and palate from back to front. 18.7. Single Harelip and Cleft Palate. â€” The head of a child injected red, showing a very wide single harelip, extending into the right nostril. There is a cleft palate, but it is not well shown, the parts being all in their natural position. 18.8. Harelip and Cleft Palate. Anencephalia. Hunterian. GG. 62. The head of an anencephalic foetus, injected red, opened behind to show the cavity of the cranium, and the cheeks split from the corners of the mouth to show the palate. The cleft extends from the back to the front, where the two sides seem to meet, and the harelip does not extend quite into the nose; the exact condition is, however, obscured by disease or decomposition having partly destroyed the nose and the edges of the lips and gums. In the roof of the mouth the edge of the palate is seen on either side separated from a well-formed septum nasi by only a narrow fissure. The uvula is double.

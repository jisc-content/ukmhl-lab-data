207 ARTERIES AND VEINS. 10.46. Aorta of Elephant. Hunierian. S. 13. A section of the aorta of an elephant to give an idea of its size and the thickness of its walls—about 1 cm. 10.47. Arch of Aorta and Great Vessels. Elephant. Hunterian. B. 1. The specimen, which is not described in the old catalogue, consists of a portion of the aorta and origins of the great vessels of a large animal—from the resemblance of the specimen in size and texture to the preceding probably an elephant. 10.48. Aorta of Turtle. Hunterian. B. 16. Portion of the above slit open to show the fasciculated inter- nal layer of the muscular coat. ABNORMAL ORIGIN OF ARTERIES. 10.49. The Coeliac Axis and Superior Mesenteric arising by a Common Trunk. Hunterian. B. 34. 10.50. The Coeliac Axis and Superior Mesenteric arising by a Common Trunk. Hunterian. B. 35. (e) Anatomy of the Veins. 10.51. The Three Coats of Veins. Vena Cava Inverted. Hunterian. C. 9. Preparation of the vena cava to show that the veins have three coats like the arteries, only thinner. The internal coat very much resembles that of an artery; the middle coat is muscular, but the arrangement of its fibres is not so regular as in the arteries; the external, in contact with the glass tube on which it is stretched, is coarser than the middle and entirely fibrous. The fibrous element predominates, there being less need of contractility than in the arteries.

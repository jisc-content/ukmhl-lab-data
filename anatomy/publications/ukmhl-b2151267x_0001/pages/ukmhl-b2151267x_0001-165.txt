81 RICKETS. 5. 25. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Right tibia macerated and dried, showing a slight curvature forwards and inwards with lateral flattening. 5.26. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. In this and the two following there is a bending inwards and a very striking antero-posterior flattening, most marked in the upper third. 5.27. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. Similar to the foregoing, but more striking. The flattening extends nearly the whole length of the shaft. There is a small projecting bony spine on the inner edge of the head, which is probably an ossification of part of the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. 5.28. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left tibia, probably from a grave, showing the above. Similar to the preceding. The greatest curve is about the middle. There is also a slight bend backwards. 5.29. Distortion of the Fibula due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left fibula macerated and dried, showing the above. A very long bone. The deformity of the subject must have been very slight. 5.30. Distortion of the Fibula due to Rickets. Hunterian. Right fibula macerated and dried. A very good example of the "boomerang-like" distortion. Compare No. 5. 2L The bone takes a decided bend inwards about the middle, while the ends above and below are nearly straight. At the bend, and for some distance above and below, it is broad and flat like a boomerang. F

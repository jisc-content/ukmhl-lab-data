276 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. Malpighian bodies, appear as small grey granules, like mustard seeds; they are especially numerous in the lower part of the specimen. The injection is not so bright as in the preceding, and there is a deposit from the spirit, in fine white granules, on the points of some of the arteries, which spoils its appearance. 15.10. Spleen Inflated by the Vein and Dried. Hunterian. V. 10. "Spleen of the antelope, inflated from the veins." "To show that the trunk of the veins opens into cells, like the trachea in the lungs." This specimen gives a very rough demonstration of the sinuses of the spleen pulp, in which the blood, circulating very slowly, is brought into intimate relation with the cellular pulp. The sinuses are, of course, of microscopic size; they are enormously exaggerated by the mode of preparation. They are irregular spaces intervening between the properly formed arteries and veins; the blood is not extravasated; the sinuses have no communication with the lymphatics, which are never filled by injection of the arteries or veins unless rupture of some vessel occur. 15.11. The Splenic Artery and Vein. Turtle. Hunterian. V. 12. The spleen of a turtle injected, the arteries red, the veins yellow; the former are much smaller than the latter. 15.12. The Vascularity of the Spleen. Turtle. Hunterian. V. 13. A section of the spleen of a turtle, "injected red by both arteries and veins; the injection has got amongst the reticular substance, and makes it appear one uniform mass of injection," i.e. the sinuses of the pulp have been filled from the blood- vessels. 15.13. The Vascularity of the Spleen. Turtle. Hunterian. V. 13a. Similar to the preceding.

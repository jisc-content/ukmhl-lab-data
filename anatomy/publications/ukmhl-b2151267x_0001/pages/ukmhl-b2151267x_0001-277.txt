CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF THE LIMBS. 193 9.7. Lizard with Double Ended Tail. A large lizard showing the above. One of the points continues the line of the tail; the other strikes off to the left at an angle of about 45 degrees. The former is thicker but shorter, being only 2-5 cm. long, while the latter is fully 3'5 cm. 9.8. Talipes Varus. Hunterian. MM. 46. Left leg and foot " of a child at birth, injected red and stripped of its cuticle to show the club foot." The foot is inverted and turned up, so that the inner edge looks directly upwards and the sole inwards and backwards, the plane of it being parallel to the long axis of the leg. The next specimen shows the condition of the bones in a similar case. 9.9. Talipes Varus. Hunterian. MM. 47. " The skeleton of a similar foot." Right foot and leg of a child at birth, the soft parts carefully removed from the bones. Probably the neighbour of the preceding. The foot, as in it, is turned upon its own axis and strongly inverted, so that the inner edge looks directly upwards, and the sole inwards and backwards. The tarsal bones, as a whole, have an abnormal shape, there being a general twisting of them inwards. The astragalus is the one most affected ; its upper articular surface bears the normal relation to the tibia and fibula, but the neck and head are bent and also twisted inwards, with elongation of the outer edge and slight shortening of the inner edge. The lower end of the fibula is carried forwards slightly. The anterior part of the tarsus is also bent, apparently with compression of the scaphoid and cuneiform bones, and an increase of the normal slope (backwards from within out) of the line of the heads of the metatarsals. All these alterations have their share in the production of the deformity, which is of congenital origin. II. Deformities which are not Congenital, e.g. Contractions AFTER Burns, Flat Foot, etc. Specimens wanted. N

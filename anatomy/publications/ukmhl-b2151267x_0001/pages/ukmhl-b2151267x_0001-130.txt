46 HUNTER!AN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 3.22. United Fracture of the Clavicle near the Acromial End. Hunterian. Right clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has been just internal to the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. There is little thickening, the curve is considerably increased in a backward direction, and the outer fragment lies a little below the level of the inner. 3.23. Normal Right Scapula. Hunterian. For comparison with the succeeding fractures; macerated and -dried. 3.24. United Fracture of the Body of the Scapula. Hunterian. Left scapula macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has passed from just below the glenoid facet horizontally across the bone a little below the spine. Being very old and well healed, it cannot be traced to the posterior border, but a little hollow in that edge indicates about where it passed. Union has resulted with a deep fossa between the lower fragment and the spine, and a knob of bone projecting below the glenoid facet as if it had been detached by the accident. The glenoid facet is not involved. The detached lower part of the body has been slightly rotated, carrying the lower angle forward. 3.25. United Comminuted Fracture of the Body of the Scapula. Hunterian. Left scapula macerated and dried, illustrating the above. There lias been comminution of the whole of the bone below the spine, and union has occurred with marked deformity and with several holes in the infra-spinous fossa. The fracture, rising from just below the glenoid facet, runs across about 2 cm. below the spine, then upwards, splitting the base of the sjjine at the posterior edge. The whole lower fragment has been carried upwards and forwards, and rotated in the same direction. There is a sharp prominence Just below the neck, where the lower fragment has overlapped the upper, and the posterior edge dips into a deep bay below the spine, and then trends much farther forward than in the normal bone.

110 HUNTERIAN ANA TOMICAL CA TALOGUE. which effected its separation from the living tissues. Its upper part has a sawn surface as if an amputation had been performed, the saw cut passing below the upper limit of the necrosis. No history. 5.107. Sequestra from Septic Osteomyelitis after Compound Fracture. Hunterian. Three sequestra of dense bone, dried, similar to the preceding. 5.108. Sequestrum from Septic Osteomyelitis after Ampu- tation. Hunterian. A large portion of a long bone, including the greater part of the cancellous head, but not the epiphysis, dried. There is only a small portion of the old surface of the shaft preserved ; the rest is eroded in the usual manner, the cancellous tissue, which seems to have undergone considerable sclerosis before its death, in like fashion to the dense bone. 5.109. Sequestrum from Septic Osteomyelitis after Ampu- tation. Hunterian. A portion of the dense shell of a long bone dried. The sawn surface has necrosed in its entirety. Above, the sequestrum tapers away, getting thinner and more scooped out by the granulations till it ends in a thin jagged edge. As usual it is considerably longer on the one side than on the other. 5.110. Sequestrum from Septic Osteomyelitis after Ampu- tation. Hunterian. A sequestrum, apparently of the fibula, dried, similar to the preceding. 5. 111. Sequestrum from Septic Osteomyelitis after Ampu- tation. Hunterian. A sequestrum, probably from the tibia, dried. It consists of about 6 cm. of nearly the whole circumference of the shaft of the bone and about half of the dense wall where it is expanding into the head, â– with a considerable amount of the cancellous tissue inside it.

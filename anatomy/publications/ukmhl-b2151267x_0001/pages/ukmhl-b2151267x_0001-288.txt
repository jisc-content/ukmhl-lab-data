204 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 10. 30. The Vena Cava Inferior and Right Auricle. Hunterian. S. 25. About 10 cm. of the vena cava inferior and the right auricle dissected to show the orifices of the hepatic veins and the valve of Eustachius, which is a sharj^ crescentic ridge forming the lower margin of the entrance to the auricle; also the fasciculated inner surface of the auricle. FOETAL AND INFANTILE HEARTS, ILLUSTRATING THE PECULIARITIES OF THE ORGAN DURING INTRA-UTERINE LIFE. 10.31. The Eustachian Valve, from a Child. Hunterian. S. 27. A portion of the right auricle and inferior vena cava, showing the size and prominence of the above valve, which, in the foetus, directs the blood through the foramen ovale into the left auricle— " putting on the appearance of Brussels lace as delineated by Eustachius." 10.32. Foetal Heart showing the Foramen Ovale. Hunterian. S. 29. "The heart of a child injected red, both auricles removed, the septum remaining, and the foramen ovale seen from either side; the ventricles also opened to show the septum thin at one place"—the undefended area of the interventricular septum. Com- pare No. 10.33. From the right ventricle, recognizable by its thin walls, rises the pulmonary artery dividing into two branches; the lower passes on and divides again to supply the two lungs. The upper, running into the arch of the aorta, is called the ductus arteriosus; it carries into the general circulation, in the foetus, part of the blood which, in the adult, goes to the lungs. The innominate and right carotid and subclavian arteries are seen rising from the arch of the aorta before it receives the ductus arteriosus, so that the the blood from that passage is all sent into the descending aorta, and thus to the lower limbs and placenta. 10.33. The Heart of a "Foetus at Seven Months." Hunterian. S. 29a. The auricles and ventricles partly dissected away to show the interior of all the cavities, and "the foramen ovale covered with

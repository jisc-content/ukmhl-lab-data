245 THE LYMPHATICS OF THE HEART. towards some larger vessels about tlie cervix (upper end of the specimen as it hangs). The direction in which the vessels run can be made out by examination of the valves, even without the aid of a magnifying glass. {cl) The Lymphatics of the Heart. 12.35. The Lymphatics of the Heart. Himterian. QQ. 73. A small portion of the human heart; the lymphatics running in the subpericardial areolar tissue minutely injected with mercury. The main vessel to which they are seen to converge accompanies the coronary artery, of which the cut end is seen in the upper edge of the specimen. 12.36. The Lymphatics of the Heart. Himterian. QQ. 71. " The human heart, with the absorbents of the right and left ventricles injected with quicksilver ; the trunk from the right ventricle goes over the arch of the aorta on the forepart, passes between the two carotids, and gets into glands between the trachea and the arch of the aorta; the trunk of the left ventricle passes under the pulmonary artery, behind the arch of the aorta, to the same glands, and thence large vessels go either to the right or left subclavians, having joined the absorbents of the lungs." The main lymphatic of the left ventricle is cut away after passing between the branches of the pulmonary artery, the glands having been removed. The lymphatics of the ventricles are seen to converge to the courses of the coronary arteries. (This specimen is marked QQ. 75 on the jar, but there is another 75 to which the description corresponds; this specimen corresponds exactly with the description ofQQ. 71.) In turpentine. (e) The Lymphatics of the Lungs. 12.37. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lungs. Hunterian. D. 21. A thin slice of the outside of one of the lungs, showing the subpleural lymphatics injected with quicksilver. They form a fairly regular network, the course of the large vessels correspond- ing with the interlobular connective tissue underlying the pleura.

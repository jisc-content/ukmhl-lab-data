COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 329 21.72. Brain of Codfish. Hunterian. E. 31a. Dissection of the above, with the base of the skull and part of the spinal cord, to show "that the optic nerves do not blend, as in the human subject, but actually decussate each other." The ear is also opened, showing the ossicle. 21.73. The Olfactory Organ of a Skate, Hunterian. E. 23b. Dissection of the "olfactory nerve from a thornback," showing the large olfactory bulb, with the nerves rising from it " like the feet of a caterpillar," and being distributed on a mucous membrane, plicated into a vast number of lamellae, "resembling in some degree the gills of a fish," which may be compared to the redupli- cations of the turbinate bones in the mammaliaâ€”"corresponding to the human turbinated bones of the nose." 21.74. The Olfactory Organ of the Skate. Hunterian. GG. 64. The same part as the preceding, but more fully dissected, so as to show the sac in which lie the lamellae, and their arrangement inside it. 21.75. The Vertebral Column and Spinal Nerves of a Skate. Hunterian. E. 166. A portion of the spine of a skate, dissected to show that it is cartilaginous ; and that the anterior and posterior nerve-roots leave by different apertures, and have no ganglia, and unite outside the canal. 21.76. The Nervous System of a Snail. Himterian. E. 37. Dissection showing the above.

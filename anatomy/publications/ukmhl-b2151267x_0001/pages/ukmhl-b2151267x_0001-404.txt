320 HUNTEIilAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 21.39. The Sulci of the Cerebrum. Hunterian. E. 11. A portion of the cerebrum, showing the processes of pia mater dipping down into the sulci; injected, the arteries red, the veins Wue. 21.40. The Blood-vessels of the Cerebral Cortex. Hunterian. E. 12. A portion of the cerebrum with its pia mater; the arteries injected red, the veins white with the returning injection, showing the small size and abundance of the nutrient arteries of the cortex. "Shows it exceedingly vascular." I 21.41. The Base of the Brain. Hunterian. EE. 60. The base of the brain cleared of membranes to show the origins of the cranial nerves. The pituitary body hangs by the infundibulum, just behind and below the optic chiasma. On the right side the olfactory bulb and the root of the fourth (pathetic), and conjoined roots of the seventh (facial) and eighth (auditory) nerves are indicated by bristles, and on the left, the root of the fifth (trifacial), and the roots of the ninth (glosso-pharyngeal), tenth (pneumogastric), and eleventh (spinal accessory) all three together, and (anterior to the last) that of the twelfth (hypoglossal) are marked with knotted threads. The greater part of the cerebral hemisphere has been removed, laying open the lateral ventricles. 21.42. A Section of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 16. The specimen hangs by one of the peduncles or crura, and is intended to show the arrangement of the grey and white matter. The sulci are deeper and more regular than in the cerebrum. Beneath the crus, and to its outer side, is seen a small lobule called the flocculus, with a shred of pia mater adhering. The upper surface is readily distinguished by its flatness. 21.43. A Section of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. E. 13. Similar to the preceding, but the plane of section a little further from the median surface, so as to show the central mass of grey matter called corpus dentatum.

THE LYMPHATICS OF THE INTESTINES. 265 lens, shows a finely honey-combed appearance. The deep lym- phatics shine dimly through from the submucous connective tissue, and on the surface of the mucous membrane ramifies a plexus of very fine vessels, which probably are the ultimate lacteals of the villi, distended by the injection. 12.119. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Cod. Hunterian. QQ. 44. A piece of intestine laid open, similar to the preceding, but dried, and mounted in turpentine. 12.120. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Cod. Hunterian. QQ. 45. Similar to No. 12.118, but the lymphatics not so well injected; it shows the pitted surface of the intestine very well. 12.121. The Lymphatics of the Spiral Intestine of the Skate. Hunterian. QQ. 51. The intestine of the skate, with a window cut in the wall at three places to show the spiral valve; injected, the arteries red, the veins black, and the lymphatics with mercury, from trunk to branch by forcing the valves. The lymphatics of the superficial set are most clearly seen, forming a fine plexus ramifying along with the larger blood-vessels. Some deep lymphatics of large size, and running a circular course along with the blood-vessels, shine out less distinctly from the inner muscular, or from the submucous coatâ€”it is impossible from the examination of the specimen to say exactly which. 12.122. The Lymphatic System of a Fish, demonstrated in a Haddock. Hunterian. QQ. 53a. The anterior two-thirds of a haddock dissected so as to show the base of the skull, orbits, and viscera. The arteries are injected red, the lymphatics yellow, but the yellow has faded. The two large lateral lymphatics, and a few small ones among the viscera, and the receptaculum chyli (seen near the stomach) still show

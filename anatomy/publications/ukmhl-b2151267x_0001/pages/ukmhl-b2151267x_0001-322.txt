HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 238 upper end, through a window cat in the side of the vessel, is seen the crescentic free edge of a valve. The duct is about 1 cm. in diameter. "It was injected with spirit of wine, in consequence of which it now retains its rounded figure." 12.10. Valves of the Lymphatics. Thoracic Duct of Horse. Hunterian. D. 45a. " The thoracic duct of a horse inverted, and then filled with red injection "; a single pair of valves near its lower end indicated by bristles. They appear as thin crescentic membranes stretched out on the inner coat of the vessel, the concave edge of the crescent representing the free edge of the valve. The attachment runs up about 1 cm. above the bottom of the cavity of the valve, which is «hown by the bristle introduced into it. Compare Nos. 10.52 to 10.54, Valves of Veins. 12.11. Lymphatic Gland. Hunterian. D. 47. " An absorbent (lymphatic) gland from a child's neck"; the arteries are injected red. The gland has been laid open; in the section it appears fleshy and exceedingly vascular. 12.12. Lymphatic Gland. The Lymph Spaces exaggerated by Injection with Mercury and Drying. Horse. Hunterian. D. 58. "An absorbent gland from near the spleen of a horse." "The ^ibsorbents (lymphatics) entering the gland and the absorbents which pass out were all filled with quicksilver by one injection. After the gland had been dried' a year, it was divided longi- •tudinally, and the mercury escaped." Intended to show the cells of the gland. The adenoid tissue has all dried up, and the gland now •consists of spaces, separated by • thin partitions, freely inter- communicating. Gives a very rough demonstration of the cells or lymph spaces, which lie between the trabeculae and the adenoid tissue. 12.13. Lymphatic Vessel and Glands. Hunterian. D. 51. A large Ij^mphatic ("absorbent") vessel injected with mercury, ■entering and leaving a gland. The gland substance has almost

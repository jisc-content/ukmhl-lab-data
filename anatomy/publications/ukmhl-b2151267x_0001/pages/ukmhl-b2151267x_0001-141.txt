57 INJURIES OP BONE. and obliquely across the lower fragment, cutting three thick walls of dense bone—two external and the third between the fragments. The lines of fracture are not traceable, all the irregularity being smoothed over by the new bone. The ends of the medullary cavity are closed. The new bone is not dis- tinguishable from the old, and there is no appearance of an ab- normal number of blood-vessels in it. An advanced stage of repair. 3.57. United Fracture of the Middle of the Femur. Hunterian. Left femur, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. The shaft is bent inwards, and there is slight riding of the ends. From a young subject. The cancellous ends are full of adipocere. 3.58. United Complex Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Marked Bending outwards of the Shaft. Hunterian. Left femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The upper fragment has been splintered, one or possibly more chips being detached and lying obliquely between it and the lower. The fracture has evidently been of very old date ; and whatever amount of callus may have been thrown out at the time, there is now very little thickening—little more than filling up of the angles between the fragments. All the corners are smoothly rounded off, and the medullary cavity closed with dense bone. 3.59. Badly United Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Outward Distortion of the Shaft. Inver- sion of Lower End. Hunterian. Left femur, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. The bone is very light, and its articular ends are broken. The fragments are strongly united, but with great deformity. The ends ride considerably, and there must have been a good deal of shortening. 3.60. United Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Marked Eversion. Hunterian. Left femur macerated and dried, showing the above. There has been slight riding, probably due to obliquity of the fracture, and a little bending outwards of the shaft. The union is firm, and

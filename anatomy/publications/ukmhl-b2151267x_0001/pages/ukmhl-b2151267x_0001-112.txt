The Patella "of a Child at 4 or 5 years." Htmterian. N. 3. A similar preparation with part of the femur also, injected red and in turpentine. The patella is still entirel}^ cartilaginous.

The Patella at about 7 years. Hunterian. N. 14.

Hunterian. N. 14. The ends of the femur and tibia with the knee-joint opened, from a child of about 7 or 8 years, injected red and in turpentine.

Patella at about 9 years. Hunterian. N. 9a. A similar preparation in which the ends of the femur and tibia are much smaller, but the centre of ossification in the patella is con- siderably larger. In turpentine. 1.150. Ossification of the Patella at 10 years. Hunterian. N. 9b. A similar preparation considerably larger, perhaps at ten years, the centre of ossification about half the size of the patella.

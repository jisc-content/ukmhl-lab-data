214 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 11.17. Ossification (Calcification?) of the Pericardium. Presented by Professor Young, 1897.. The root of the aorta and the auriculo-ventricular septa, with the circle of pericardium around them, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing the above. There is a ring, varying in breadth from 1 cm. to 4 cm., of calcareous plates surrounding the heart about the line of junction of the auricles with the ventricles. "Adherent pericardium of nine years' standing." (6) Endocarditis. 11.18. Acute Endocarditis. Aneurism and Rupture of the Aortic Valves. Hunterian. S. 56. "A portion of the left ventricle of the heart, with the aorta slit open to show one of the semi-lunar valves ruptured." The posterior semi-lunar valve is thickened, and bulged in the direction of the ventricle. A ragged gap with irregular edges,, coated with fibrin, traverses the middle of the aneurismal bulging, only the free edge of the valve being left intact. The disease is limited to this one curtain. The edge which has escaped rupture appears to be sound, as if the disease had stopped short of the narrow strip which is beyond the line of contact of the three curtains in closure of the valve. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. II., fig. 2.) 11.19. Chronic Endocarditis. Shortening and Calcification of the Mitral Valve. Hunterian. S. 65. A small piece of the left ventricle and mitral valve. The valve is crumpled up, and there is an irregular calcareous mass in its under surface, which is exposed by turning up the chordae tendineae. 11.20. Chronic Endocarditis. Very Large Calcareous Nodule in the Mitral Valve. Shortening of the Curtains. Hunterian. S. 66. "A very large ossification in the substance of the heart round the mouth of the left ventricle; from a fat woman, in whom the arteries of the uterus and brain were also ossified." The

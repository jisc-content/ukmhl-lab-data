See under No. 6. 48. 6.45. Gouty Arthritis. Ulceration of Bone and Cartilage. Hiinterian. LL. 29a. A similar finger. The cartilages are extensively ulcerated. In addition, an ulcerative process has very considerably eroded the cancellous bone around the edges and underneath the articular plates. 6.46. Gouty Arthritis, Urate of Soda Deposit. Hunterian. LL. 295. A gouty thumb, where there has been an advanced condition of destruction of the cartilages and excavation of the bone below the articular head at the base of the first phalanx. As a result there has been ankylosis; and when the joint was opened, the eroded bone has broken. Between the remains of the cartilages and in the granulations in the fracture is seen " the chalk accumulated about the joint in considerable quantity." 6.47. Gouty Arthritis. Ankle-joint. Hunterian. LL. 43. " The ankle-joint covered with a stratum of chalk in many places ; the cartilage may be seen shining through." There is quite a thick layer over the cartilage of what microscopic examination of a portion of the next specimen shows to be fine crystals of urate of soda. There is some ulceration of the cartilages around the edges. 6.48. Gouty Arthritis. Urate of Soda Deposit. Hunterian. LL. 44. " Some of the joints of the tarsus, the chalky stratum not being so thick." Some thin slices cut from one of the surfaces showed the cartilage to be covered with a layer of bunches of minute acicular crystals of urate of soda having a very slight yellowish tinge. They seemed to be entangled with the superficial layer of the carti- lage. In a second slice taken from below the first there were none. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 11.) There is some thinning and ulceration

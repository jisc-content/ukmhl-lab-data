The bond of union is a mass of cancellous bone, fully 6 cm. in diameter, fairly smooth on the outside, and evidently very old. The cancellated bone of the femur and os innominatum are continuous into one another without a trace re- maining of the line of union. The specimen is figured, but without the wedge cut out of it, in Cheselden's Osieographia, Plate XLVII., fig. 1, as an "Ankylosis of the os innominatum and os femoris ; as communicated to me by Mr. Westbrook." No further history. 6.29. Tubercular Arthritis. Hip-joint. Cure by Anky- losis. Hunterian. Portion of the innominate bone and femur, from a grave, illus- trating the above. Like the preceding specimen, a wedge has been removed so as to show the interior of the ankylosis. The fusion of the cancellated tissues is complete. A thin line of denser bone marks the line of union. In the midst of the cancellous bone is a cavity, probably medullary. Clearly the disease had been long extinct. ANKLP>JOINT. 6.30. Tubercular Arthritis. Ankle-joint. Caries of the Astragalus. Presented by Dr. Rankine of Carluke. Lower end of tibia and fibula and the astragalus macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The ends of the bones show an eroded carious condition. The astragalus is particularly light and spongy. There is some periosteal new-formation on the sides of the bones, probably indicative of septic complications. The fibula shows an old healed fracture near the lower end. UPPER LIMB—SHOULDER-JOINT. 6.31. Caries of the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula. Tuber- cular (?). Hunterian. LL. 31. Portion of the right scapula cleaned and in spirit, stained greenish. " Glenoid cavity of scapula—carious." The greater part of the articular surface is covered by dense fibrous tissue cut across as if there had been fibrous ankylosis. The disease was still

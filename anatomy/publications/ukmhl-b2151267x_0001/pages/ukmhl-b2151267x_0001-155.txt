INJURIES OF BONE. 71 ends are rounded off, showing that this is not an accident of preparation. The right ischium has also been broken across, and has united again. The right acetabulum is filled up by an irregular mass of bone, part of the outer surface of which is eburnated and polished by friction of another fragment; probably a case of intra-capsular fracture of the neck of the femur with non-union and formation of a false joint. 3.105. Old United Fracture of the Femur of a Quadruped. H^lntenan. Left femur macerated, dried, and divided longitudinally, showing the above. The fracture is old, and the bone is smooth and polished. The fragments have overlapped to such a degree that the bone must have been shortened by about a third. Union has been effected by coalescence of the opposed outer surfaces, and by the masses of bone closing the medullary cavities. The medullary cavities of the two fragments are quite distinct; they are very wide, and the walls of the bones very thin. Half of the upper epiphysis is absent, the bones being from a young animal. 3.106. Old United Fracture of the Femur of a Quadruped. Hunterian. Right femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The fracture has passed from above and in front obliquely downwards and backwards, and the upper fragment is tilted forwards, meeting the lower at an open angle. The two ends are firmly united in a thick mass of bone, which gives evidence on its sides of a slight degree of overlapping of the fragments. 3.107. Recent Fracture of the Femur in a Quadruped. Not united. Hunterian. The two fragments of the femur of some quadruped, macerated, dried, and mounted together on a piece of wood. They have been riding over one another, and were probably united by recent callus, which, being not fully developed, has allowed them to separate in maceration, just as the upper epiphysis has separated through the animal having been young. There has been extensive irregular

DISEASES OF THE 8K1N. 393 28.11. The Skin in Small-pox. Hunterian. II. 41. A small portion of skin injected red, " the heads (of the pustules) removed to show the bottom extremely vascular and red, the slough having just thrown off." 28.12, The Skin in Small-pox. Hunterian. II. 50. Similar to the preceding. V. Tumours of the Skin and its Appendages. 28.13. Dermoid Cyst from the Leg of a Sheep. Hunterian. II 39. "A cyst from a sheep's leg." A long spindle-shaped cyst, v.'ith fairly thick walls, covered internally with fine hair. It is filled with balls of tightly compressed hair, "which had grown from its surface, shed, and accumulated gradually." 28.14. Tumour at the Edge of the Nail of the Great Toe. Hunterian. II. 35b. A left great toe, the. cuticle and nail removed, showing a tumour " about the size of a shelled almond," growing out from the inner edge of the bed of the nail. No history. On microscopic exami- nation of a small slice from the under part of the side next the nail, nothing was found but normal skin and subcutaneous tissue. A section of the base would be necessary to determine its nature. It is not malignant. Probably it is an ungual exostosis, covered by a good deal of soft tissue. See next specimen for the nail and cuticle. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 78.) 28.15. The Cuticle and Nail from the preceding Tumour. Hunterian. II 35a. The nail is thickened, deformed, and has lost its natural shining surface. A mass of thick irregular epidermis, which covered the tumour, has fallen away, and is hung to the lower end of the cuticular sheath.

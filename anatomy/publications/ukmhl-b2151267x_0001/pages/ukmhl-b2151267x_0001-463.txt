379 THE SKIN. 27.9. The Blood-vessels of the Skin. Hunteriav. II. 7. " The left hand of a young woman, minutely injected red and stripped of its cuticle." It is of a beautiful red colour, and appears highly vascular, but not so vascular as the preceding specimens of the face. The palm of the hand, especially near the tip of the fingers, and the beds of the nails are redder than the back. The tissues of the wrist are seen in section beautifully injected. 27.10. The Blood-vessels of the Skin. Hunterian. II. 7a. Another left hand (much larger) injected red, showing the same as the preceding. 27.11. The Blood-vessels of the Skin. Hunterian. II. 8. " The foot of the same subject " (left) injected red, and the cuticle removed ; similar to the preceding, and apparently equally vas- cular. The cut surface at the ankle shows the relative vascularity of the internal tissues ; the cartilage and tendons appear quite avascular. 27.12. The Blood-vessels of the Skin. Hunterian. II. 8a. Right foot injected red, similar to the preceding. The Epidermis or Cuticle. 27.13. The Epidermis or Cuticle. Hunterian. II 9. A portion of the cuticle of the sole of the foot nearly an eighth of an inch (3 mm.) thick. It is marked by parallel ridges running across the foot, crossed at fairly regular intervals by minute fur- rows. These ridges, after running a short distance, bend and join one another at an acute angle. The outer surface is covered with a horny layer which is desquamating, but shows the ridges very distinctly. In the centre of each ridge is a dotted line due to the mouths of the sweat ducts, which open all along the crests of the ridges in the transverse furrows. The inner surface shows furrows corresponding to the ridges, separated by narrow ridges corresponding to the furrows of the outer surface, and in each furrow a slight line broken at regular intervals by transverse ridges and dots which, as in the outer surface, represent sweat ducts.

256 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 12.84. The Lymphatics of the Intestines and Mesenteric Glands. Kitten. Huntcrian. D. 59c. A portion of the intestine and mesentery, stretched on blue glass, similar to the preceding. There is a good deal of fat along the course of the vessels, which hides the lymphatics, but at numerous points little yellowish bodies stand out from the fat, which are the lymphatic glands. They are very small, in proportion to the viscera, compared with the same structures in the human subject. 12.85. The Mesenteric Glands. Kitten. Eunterian. QQ. 22. A portion of the mesentery of the kitten, showing the lacteals terminating in a mass of glands at the root, called the "Pancreas Aselli." Injected with mercury and mounted in turpentine. 12.86. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Lacteals. Por- poise. Eunterian. D. 22. A portion of the intestine and mesentery of the porpoise, the arteries injected red, the lymphatics with mercury. The arteries run across the mesentery in large trunks, branching only near the intestine; there are lymphatics accompanying these arteries, and also others running separate courses across the spaces between the blood-vessels to some large lymphatic glands about the root of the mesentery. 12.87. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Lacteals. Por- poise. Eunterian. QQ. 36. A portion of the intestine and mesentery injected, the arteries red, the lymphatics with mercury, dried and mounted on blue paper. 12.88. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Lacteals. Horse. Eunterian. QQ. 18. A small portion of the intestine of the horse, with the super- ficial and a few deep lymphatics very finely injected with mercury. In turpentine.

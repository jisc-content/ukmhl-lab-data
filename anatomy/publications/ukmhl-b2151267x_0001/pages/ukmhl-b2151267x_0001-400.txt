HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 516 shining; tlie inner, prolonged into fringes which dip into the sulci of the brain, is shaggy with the ends of inouraerable blood- vessels, which enter the substance of the brain. 21.21. The Vascularity of the Pia Mater. Hunterian. EE. 5. A portion of the pia mater from the upper surface of the cerebrum, "the pia mater injected red; the injection has returned by the veins colourless: the processes on its under surface, which pass between the convolutions of the brain, are seen exceedingly vascular." This specimen is figured in Professor Macewen's Pyogenic Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord, fig. 24, p. 48, to illustrate "the vascularity of the pia mater and its intimate connections with the cerebral tissue." 21.22. The Vascularity of the Pia Mater. Hunterian. E. 8. Similar to the preceding, but paler in colour. The particles of vermilion have been too coarse to pass the finer vessels, the injection basis (tallow) accordingly appears white in the veins. 21.23. The Vascularity of the Pia Mater. Hunterian. EE. 6. Similar to No. 20. 21.24. The Vascularity of the Pia Mater. Hunterian. E. 8a. A similar portion of the pia mater, less finely injected red by the arteries; the vermilion has been dropped in the capillaries, and the tallow which formed the basis of the injection has returned by the veins, which appear injected white. 21.25. The Pia Mater. Hunterian. E. 9, A portion of the above, the arteries and veins both injected white, showing the vascular fringes. 21.26. The Pia Mater of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. E. 18. The vertebral and basilar arteries, and the pia mater of the medulla oblongata and inferior surface of the cerebellum, injected

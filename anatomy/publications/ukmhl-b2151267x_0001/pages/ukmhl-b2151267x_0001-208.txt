HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 124 earlier stage. The new bone is rough and very porous, and there are a number of holes in its surface, as if there had been small necroses. Probably syphilitic. 5.156. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. Fibula macerated and dried, showing the above. The new-formed bone is so old and dense that it is not distinguishable from the old. The enlargement is general and pretty considerable. Probably syphilitic. Compare No. 5. 152, which this bone decidedly re- sembles. 5.157. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Rickets (?). Hunterian. A fibula macerated and dried, greatly thickened by periosteal new bone about the middle, where it is also bent forwards into a shape similar to the rickety fibulae. See Nos. 5. 21, 23, 29, and 30. Probably a syphilitic thickening of a bone deformed by a previous, perhaps very old, attack of rickets. 5.158. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula. Hunterian. Portion of a fibula macerated and dried, showing the above; of old standing. At the lower end there has also been an osteitis of a later date, and in the rarefying stage, destroying the lower end. The articular surface is eroded to a considerable extent. Above this there is a thin crust of recent periosteal new bone. The nature of this cannot be made out now ; possibly septic inflammation from a wound or ulcer. 5.159. Syphilitic (?) Enlargement of the Tibia and Fibula. Hunterian. Lower portion of the tibia and fibula, probably from a grave, showing a very great enlargement of the latter, with very little alteration of the former. The fibula is almost as large as the tibia. The new-formed bone is smooth over most of the outer surface; rough elsewhere, especially along the lines of attachment of fasciae and ligaments. Possibly syphilitic, but possibly due to an ulcer or even elephantiasis.

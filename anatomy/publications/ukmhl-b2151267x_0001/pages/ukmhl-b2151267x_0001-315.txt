231 ANEURISM. 11.66, Aneurism of the " Posterior Tibial Artery." Hunterian. KK. 24. " An aneurism in the opposite leg of the same man to whom the preceding aneurism of the femoral belonged." (No. 11.65.) The posterior tibial nerve is seen stretched over the sac. The sac is fully 10 cm. in diameter, filled with laminated coagulum, and it is pushing through between the tibia and fibula, which do not seem to have been pressed apart, though it is impossible now to deter- mine this point. Both are eroded ; the sac is very loosely adherent and thin round the edges of the erosion. The tibia has grown out into a ridge in front of the erosion on its inner surface. A portion of the femoral artery slit open is stitched to the tibia; the manner in which the vessels communicated with the aneurism cannot now be seen, but the anterior tibial rises just above the sac, and passes through between the bones, which proves this to be an aneurism of the posterior tibial. 11.67. Aneurism of the Popliteal Artery. Hunterian. KK. 24a. The lower end of the femur and upper ends of the tibia and fibula, with an aneurism of the popliteal artery, seated just above the knee-joint, and pressing between the condyles of the femur. The sac, which is thick and fibrous, and contains some stratified blood-clot, has been split open laterally, and the posterior half, with the artery, turned inwards. The artery, in which a bougie has been placed, communicates with the aneurism by an oval orifice, measuring 15 by 5 mm. On the other side the artery is seen to be dilated in a fusiform manner, and it has been opened behind to show the interior of this dilatation. " Case amputated, Bartholomew's Hospital; Mr. Pott's; died." Laminated Goagula from Aneurisms. 11.68. Laminated Coagulum from Aneurism. Dissected. Hunterian. KK. 16. Formed in distinct broad laminae easily separated from one another.

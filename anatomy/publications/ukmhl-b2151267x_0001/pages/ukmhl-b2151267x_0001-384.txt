HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 300 SECTION IL LUNGS. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. Specimens wanted. II. Injuries to the Lungs. Specimens wanted. III. Changes due to Alterations of Nutrition and Various Local Causes. 18.19. Consolidated Lung. Hunterian.

Dr. Allen Thom.sonIs Collection. This specimen, of which there is no history, consists of a portion of a lobe of the lung, showing a large haemorrhagic infarction. It is of a deep brown colour, of triangular shape, its base at the surface of the lung corresponding with the area of distribution of a branch of the pulmonary artery. At its apex the artery is seen laid open; it is filled with soft blood-clot, and white thrombus adhering firmly to its walls and completely obstructing it. IV. Alterations due to Inflammatory Diseases. 18.21. Fibrinous Exudation of Pleurisy. Hunterian. T. 75a. " A portion of the lungs from a patient who had general inflam- mation of the thorax, the lungs are encrusted both on the side

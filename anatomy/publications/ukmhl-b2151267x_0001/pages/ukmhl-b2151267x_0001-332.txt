248 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 12.47. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Liver. Uunterian. D. 26. A portion of the upper surface of the liver, showing a number of minute lymphatics in the subperitoneal connective tissue ending in a very large vessel. Injected with mercury. 12.48. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Liver passing through the Diaphragm. Hunterian. QQ. 59. A portion of the left lobe of the liver, from a boy 12 years old, injected red by the arteries. The lymphatics of the upper surface, injected with mercury and very numerous, are passing along to the left lateral ligament to perforate the diaphragm, by a portion of which the preparation hangs on one side. The trunks then either pass forwards along the pericardium to the anterior mediastinal glands, or backwards along the crus of the diaphragm to the thoracic duct. (While the wording has been altered for the sake of clearness, this description is, in substance, exactly the same as the original in the old catalogue.) 12. 49. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Liver. Upper Surface. Hunterian. QQ. 61. A portion of the upper surface of the right lobe of the liver of the same subject as the preceding. The lymphatics (forming a very fine plexus) run in two diverging sets, each of which converges into two or three vessels of moderate size which pass through the diaphragm, and joining with those from the left lobe pass forwards along the pericardium to the anterior mediastinal glands, or backwards along the crus of the diaphragm to the thoracic duct. (Slightly altered from the old catalogue for the sake of clearness.) 12.50. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Upper Surface of the Liver. Hunterian. QQ. 62. Another portion of the upper surface of the right lobe, show- ing numerous lymphatic vessels running over the suspensory (falciform or longitudinal) ligament to join the vessels described in the last two specimens.

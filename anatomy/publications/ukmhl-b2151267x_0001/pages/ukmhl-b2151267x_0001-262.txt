17b HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. the eighth, ninth, and tenth, these outgrowths are of considerable size, fully 3 cm. wide, projecting about 1 cm., and interlock- ing by their sinuous edges. The tenth and eleventh are ankylosed by a thick plate of bone, evidently formed of outgrowths of the same nature, which have fused with one another. The facets for the ribs on the sides of the bodies and on the transverse processes are lipped round their edges. The articular processes here and there show slight traces of the same lesion. Compare Nos. 6.77 to 6.82, under Lateral Curvature of the Spine. 6.95. Arthritis Deformans of the Spine. Hunterian. Six lower dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae macerated, dried, and articulated, showing the above. The specimen shows processes of dense bone projecting from the edges of the vertebral bodies, and interlocking with one another. The articular processes and facets for the ribs are slightly affected also. 6.96. Arthritis Deformans of the Spine. Hunterian. Four dorsal and two lumbar vertebrae macerated, dried, and articulated, showing abundant outgrowths from the edges of the bodies, as in the preceding. 6.97. Arthritis Deformans of the Spine. Section of Anky- losed Vertebrae. Hunterian. Two dorsal vertebrae macerated and dried, showing the above. They are ankylosed by a bridge of bone about 1 -5 cm. wide, which has grown across the space for the intervertebral disc on the right side. The bodies have been sawn in two vertically to show the structure of the bridge of new bone, which is of ivory-like density and hardness. 6.98. Arthritis Deformans of Spine associated with Lateral Curvature. Hunterian. Ten dorsal vertebrae, probably from a grave, showing the above. There is slight lateral curvature. On the concavity at the point of greatest curvature there are considerable osseous out growths similar to those seen in the preceding. In one case thej' have produced ankylosis.

SARCOMATA OF BONE. 133 (b) periosteal sarcojviata of bone. 5.177. Periosteal Sarcoma (?) of Femur. Hnnterian. Section of the lower two-thirds of a femur, from an adolescent subject, partly macerated and dried. A spindle-shaped thickening, consisting principally of radiating spicules of bone, extends from the middle of the shaft down into the condyle. The old dense shell is considerably eroded and rarefied. The medullary cavity is filled with a fine cancellous bone, which was probably tumour tissue. Histological evidence is of course wanting, but from the naked-eye appearances it is probable that it was a periosteal sarcoma. 5.178. Periosteal Sarcoma (Osteosarcoma ?) of the Fibula. Hunterian. Fibula of a young adult, macerated and dried. Tlie upper third, 11 cm., of the shaft and the head to the edge of the articular surface is enveloped in a mass of irregular spongy bone, about 10 cm. in its largest diameter. Probably the skeleton of an ossifying periosteal sarcoma, possibly, however, of an osteoma (ossifying chondroma), like No. 5. 166. The fibula below the growth is thickened as if by chronic periostitis. 5.179. Periosteal Sarcoma (?) of Femur. Hunterian. Lower portion of a femur, probably from a grave. The lower part of the shaft is considerably expanded. Its surface consists of a mass of irregularly radiate coarse fibres and plates of bone. The lower end is broken away, showing the medullary cavity considerably enlarged at the expense of the old shell, of which no trace remains. Probably the skeleton of a periosteal sarcoma which has also been growing inside the bone. 5.180. Periosteal Sarcoma (?) of the Tibia. Hunterian. A tibia from a young adult, macerated and dried (mounted upside down). The upper half of the diaphysis and the sides of the epi- physis, and also a smaller completely distinct area of the former near the lower end, are enveloped in fusiform masses of fine asbestos-like

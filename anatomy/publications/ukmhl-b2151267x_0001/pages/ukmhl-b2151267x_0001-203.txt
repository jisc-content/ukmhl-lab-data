INFLAMMATION OF BONE DUE TO SYPHILIS. 119 longitudinally. The cut surfaces show the medullary cavity filled with a rather dense cancellous tissue. The old dense shell is traceable, though mostly removed by a process of rarefaction which has extended from within through it even out into the dense new bone, so that the compact outer shell is not much thicker than it would be in a normal radius. The bone is very much increased in weight as well as size. 5.133. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Ulna. Hunterian. An ulna macerated and dried. Thickened and condensed in like fashion to No. 5, 130 by chronic inflammation. Probably syphilitic. The new bone is fairly porous. 5.134. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Ulna. Hunterian. An ulna macerated and dried. Enlarged in the same manner as the preceding, and very much condensed, having a white smooth surface like that of No. 5.131. Very heavy. 5.135. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur. Hunterian. Right femur, probably from a grave, showing a slight thickening of the lower two-thirds of the diaphysis by a thin layer of porous periosteal new bone. The crust has been broken in front, where it happens to be thickest, showing the underlying dense shell slightly rarefied. The new-formation is rather patchy in its dis- tribution in the upper parts. The result of a fairly recent peri- ostitis, which was very probably of syphilitic origin. 5.136. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur. Hunterian. Left femur macerated and dried. About one-third of the shaft in the upper part of the lower half is encased nearly all round in a thin crust of periosteal new bone, which is fairly dense, showing that it is a formation of rather old standing. Very like the pre- ceding, and probably also of syphilitic origin. 5.137. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. Right tibia macerated and dried. Nearly the whole bone is covered with a thin and very patchily distributed crust of porous

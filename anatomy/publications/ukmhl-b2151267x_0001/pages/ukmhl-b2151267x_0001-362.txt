278 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 16.3. Chronic Hypertrophy of the Spleen. Hunterian. RR. 381. A much enlarged spleen, history unknown, of very dense con- sistence, tough, and with the capsule somewhat wrinkled, illustrating an advanced state of the above. Probably malarial. 16.4. Fibroma of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 15a. This specimen is figured in Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. VI., PI. I., fig. 1, as an example of a soft "cartilaginous" change in the coat of the spleen, which is often met in old people. It is also somewhat shrunken, being from an old man. Microscopic examination of one of the nodules shows it to consist of very dense fibrous tissue ; the cut surface to the naked eye is exactly like cartilage. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 4.3.) IV. Changes due to Inflammatory Diseases. 16.5. Tuberculosis of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 16. "A portion of the spleen from a consumptive child, in which there is the same appearance of tubercles as in the lungs." 16.6. Tuberculosis of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 17. "Ditto from an adult, injected red, in which the tubercles are still larger; they seem to be scrophulous suppurations of the cellular part." V. Tumours of the Spleen. Specimens wanted.

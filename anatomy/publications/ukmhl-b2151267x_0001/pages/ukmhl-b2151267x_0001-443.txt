COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE EYE. 359 and the same membrane, as a portion of the membrana pupillaris is here left on "; together they form the capsule of the lens. 23.77. The Iris and Crystalline Lens. Lamb. Hunierian. FF. 101. The crystalline lens, iris, and cornea dissected out. Shows also a portion of the membrana pupillae. 23.78. The Crystalline Lens. Elephant. Hunterian. FF. 90. " Not nearly so large as in the Neel Ghaw or Ox." (b) birds. 23.79. The Eyelids and Eye. Turkey. Huntericm. FF. 80a. Opened transversely, the posterior parts turned down and the vitreous removed, showing the internal structure. The remains of the retina are seen as a thick whitish membrane attached to the optic nerve. From the optic nerve downwards and forwards, for about a quarter of the circumference, stretches a line of straight processes, of unequal lengths, peculiar to birds, called the pecten ("musculus serratus "). The fissure through which they enter the eye is the remains of the choroidal fold, which sometimes persists in part, giving rise to the condition called coloboma iridis. The specimen also shows the vascular choroid coat, the ciliary processes, lens, sclerotic, and eyelids, which have no eyelashes. 23.80. Eye of Turkey. Hunterian. FF. 80b. A similar preparation without the eyelids, the lens removed to show the iris and pupil. The pecten is well displayed. (C) REPTILES. 23.81. Eye of Chameleon. Hunterian. FF. 72c. Divided transversely, and the sclerotic and humours removed. The cornea is very convex and small in proportion to the size of the globe.

INJURIES OF BONE. 43 3.8. United Fractures of the Ribs at the Anterior Angle. Hunterian. Two lower ribs macerated and dried, illustrating the above, rhere is almost no displacement of the fragments, but a consider- ible mass of callus shows the seat of fracture. What displacement ;here is has been of the end of the posterior fragment inwards. From the appearance of the callus the fractures are very old, and jrobably a certain amount of distortion has been rectified in the latural processes of repair. 3.9. United Fracture of the Ribs at the Anterior Angle. Hunterian. A lower rib macerated, illustrating the above. The fracture must lave been of very old standing. The continuity of the fragments :s perfectly restored. Only a slight thickening without distortion jhows the seat of fracture. 3.10. Recent United Fracture of the Ribs. Hunterian. A tenth rib macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The Tacture is at the posterior angle, and on the outer surface the callus las been partly dissected away showing the projecting edge of the posterior fragment. On the upper and inner surface is a mass of spongy sub-periosteal new bone, in some parts fully 5 mm. thick, md extending 2 cm. along the length of the bone. Several large 'oramina for blood-vessels appear in the mass of callus. Anterior to this is another swelling as if from a former fracture. 3.11. United Fracture of Two Ribs with Ankylosis between them. Hunterian. Two lower ribs macerated and dried, illustrating the above. Both ribs have been fractured about the middle and at the anterior angles, and have united with slight deformity. In addition, a bridge of bone 3 cm. broad by 5 mm. thick has formed at the posterior fracture, firmly uniting the bones to one another. The bridge of new bone is tunnelled on the outside for the intercostal artery and nerve of the upper rib. The intercostal space is about the normal width. The part of the lower rib anterior to the fracture at the angle is wanting.

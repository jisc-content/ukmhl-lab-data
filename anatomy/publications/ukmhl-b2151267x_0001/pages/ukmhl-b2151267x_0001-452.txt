3G8 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. front and to the outside of it. The sigmoid sinus, partly opened, is indicated in the lower by a long white bristle. 25.17. The Membrana Tympani. Hunterian. EE. 14. The whole organ of hearing, except the external ear and meatus, " of a foetus," injected red, showing principally the membrana tympani concave externally, with the handle of the malleus shining through it. The incus is also seen, but less distinctly. From the inner side the three ossicles are visible, the articulation between the incus and the stapes is unfortunately broken. Dried and mounted in turpentine. 25.18. The Membrana Tympani. Eunterian. EE. 16. The tympanic ring, ossicles, and adjacent 23arts of the temporal bone injected red; the ring divided and the membrana tympani split into two layers continuous respectively with the skin and the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity. Both layers are evidently vascular. The specimen hangs by the very much shrivelled-up external ear. Mounted in turpentine. 25.19. The Ossicles of the Ear. Eunterian. A complete set mounted dry on a black card, the incus above, the stapes in the middle, and the malleus below. 25.20. The Ossicles of the Ear. Eunterian. Several sets of ossicles mounted in different positions on blue paper to show the shape of the bones. Only one of the mallei is complete, the long process (processus gracilis) of the others having been broken. (HH. 22 ?) 25.21. The Auditory Ossicles in situ. Eunterian. EE. 17. The middle and internal ear " of a child at birth " dissected, the membrana tympani removed to show the above, and also the " musculus externus mallei" (laxator tympani of Soemmering or anterior ligament of the malleus) sticking out above the tympanic ring; the cochlea, vestibule, and vertical semicircular canal also displayed.

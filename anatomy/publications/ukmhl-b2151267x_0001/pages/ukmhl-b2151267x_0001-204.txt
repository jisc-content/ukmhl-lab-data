120 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. bone of fairly open texture. The result of a not very recent periostitis; probably of syphilitic origin. 5.138. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. Left tibia, probably from a grave. The lower half, more particu- larly on its inner subcutaneous side and towards the lower end, covered with an irregular fairly thick crust of porous periosteal new bone. Probably the result of a syphilitic periostitis. 5.139. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. Portion of a right tibia, probably from a grave. The lower half of the inner subcutaneous surface covered with a thin crust of porous periosteal new bone. This is broken away in places, showing the old shell somewhat rarefied. Probably syphilitic. 5.140. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. Portion of a left tibia macerated and dried. The inner surface of the lower third is covered by a node-like enlargement in the form of a crust of very spongy bone. Most of this is broken away, showing the rarefied surface of the old shell. 5.141. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. A right tibia, probably from a grave, showing in the middle third of the shaft a spindle-shaped thickening composed of periosteal new- formed bone. This extends all round the shaft, but is much thicker and more extensive on the outer and posterior than on the inner subcutaneous side. Its surface is irregular. Its texture is fairly close, showing that it was not of recent formation. Probably syphilitic. 5.142. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Hunterian. A large right tibia, probably from a grave, showing an old peri- osteal node of the middle of the shaft. The thickening is mostly on the posterior and inner surfaces. The new bone is considerably condensed, and its surface fairly smooth. Probably syphilitic.

THE RELATIONS OF THE VISCERA. 199 to show the viscera of both cavities in their situation, from before." The succeeding specimens show the relations and relative sizes of the viscera at earlier dates. In this specimen the thymus and heart are considerably overlapped by the lungs, although these have not been expanded by respiration. The heart is enveloped in the peri- cardium. The liver is larger in proportion than it is in the adult, but much less so than at an earlier period. The testicles are in the scrotum. 10.9. The Viscera in a Female Child "at Birth," from behind. Hunterian. S. 2. The posterior parietes have been removed to give a back view of the contents of both cavities. The relations of the aorta and its great branches to the oesophagus and trachea above and the rectum below are very well displayed. Injected with vermilion. 10.10. The Viscera in a Male Foetus "at Seven Months," from before. Hunterian. S. 3. Similar to No. 10.9. The appearance of the lungs suggests that the foetus had breathed. The bladder is seen opened from above, and oh each side of it are the testicles, not yet descended into the scrotum. 10.11. The Viscera of a Child, from before. Hunterian. S. 3 c. Similar to the preceding. The thymus gland is very large and distinct. Behind is seen the sac of a spina bifida laid open. 10.12. The Thoracic Viscera and the Liver of a Child at Birth. Hunterian. S. 6. The child was probably still-born. The lungs are injected with tallow, the systemic arteries red. The spine is left to preserve the relations of the parts, and a portion of the right lung has been removed to show the thymus gland and right auricle of the heart. 10.13. "The Contents of the Thorax of a Child at Birth: Still-born." Hunterian. S. 7. The spine has been removed to show the descending aorta em- bedded in the areolar tissue of the posterior mediastinum; the

HUNTERIAN ANA TOMICAL CA TA LOG UE. 44 3.12. United Fracture of Two Ribs with Ankylosis. Hunterian. Parts of two lower ribs macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has been about the anterior angle, and there is very little thickening or deformity; but between the bones is developed an osseous bridge, 1 cm. wide and 4 mm. thick, firmly uniting them. 3.13. United Fracture of Rib at the Middle. Hunterian. Lower rib macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The bone has healed with considerable thickening, but no deformity. 3.14. Normal Clavicle for Comparison with the succeeding Fractures. Hunterian. Right clavicle macerated and dried. 3.15. United Fracture of the Sternal End of the Clavicle. Hunterian. Left clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has been about an inch from the sternal end of the bone, and has apparently passed obliquely from above and behind, down- wards, forwards, and inwards, implicating the sterno-clavicular articulation, and that with the first costal cartilage. There is very little callus on the upper and posterior surfaces, and there is almost no elevation or depression of either fragment, but there has been considerable displacement in the antero-posterior direction, so that the curve of the inner half of the bone is almost abolished. In front and below there is a large irregular mass of new bone, from which a section has been sawn out about the middle, showing its cancellous structure. The old shaft appears in the bottom of the cut. 3.16. United Fracture of the Clavicle near the Sternal End, Hunterian. Left clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has occurred in the inner half of the clavicle, running in a very oblique direction from near the middle of the bone forwards and inwards to about 2 cm. from the sterno-clavicular articulation. There has been considerable forward displacement of the inner

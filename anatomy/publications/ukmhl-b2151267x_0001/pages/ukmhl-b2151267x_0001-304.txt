220 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. (b) Gcdcareoiis Infiltration of Arteries. 11.36. Calcareous Infiltration of Arteries. Hunterian. B. 2\. " An artery slit open, showing a number of ossifications (calcifica- tions) of a purple colour." The vessel is about the size of the femoral. The calcareous plates involve the whole thickness of the vessel wall, and there are no definite atheromatous patches. It is the other condition, viz. calcareous infiltration of the middle coat, and the plates extend from the loose tunica externa to the tunica intima, and even project naked into the lumen of the vessel. 11.37. Calcareous Infiltration of Arteries. Hunterian. B. 22a. A similar specimen dried and mounted in turpentine. (c) Aneurism. 11.38. "Aneurismal Dilatation of the Aorta." Atheroma. Contraction of the Valves. Hunterian. B. 36. A portion of the aorta slightly dilated and atheromatous. The patches present a cicatricial appearance. The aortic valves are thickened and contracted, so that in life the valve was probably incompetent. 11.39. Dilatation of the Abdominal Aorta. Atheroma. Cicatricial Appearance. Hunterian. KK. 11. " A portion of the descending aorta slit open to show the inner surface becoming aneurismal, irregular, and fasciculated." (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. I., PI. IV., fig. 3.) 11.40. Dilatation of the Aorta and Innominate Artery. Atheroma with Calcareous Infiltration. Jeffray Collection. The arch of the aorta laid open, showing atheroma very general and advanced in the first part and less marked beyond the origin of the left subclavian. There are two or three atheromatous ulcers and numerous calcified patches, some of the plates projecting through

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 348 is the ciliary muscle, behind which are seen the ciliary processes of the choroid, deeply pigmented, their serrated posterior edge corresponding with the anterior border of the retina. A number of the ciliary nerves are seen running in the choroid to be distributed to the ciliary body and iris. 23.17. The Choroid, Iris, Ciliary Body and Lens, in situ. Hunterian. FF. 236. An eyeball dissected like the preceding. " One half of sclerotica turned up, in an otherwise entire eyeball, to show choroid in its uninjected state continued into iris; the former appears of a dark brown from the nigrum pigmentum underneath, the latter of a blue and white intermixed; the vessels of the choroid are evidently continued into the iris." 23.18. The Choroid, Iris, Ciliary Body and Lens, in situ. Hunterian. FF. '23d. Similar to the preceding. 23.19. The Sclerotic, Choroid, and Ciliary Processes from behind. Hunterian. FF. 23aa. An eyeball divided transversely, and the vitreous humour and lens removed, showing the above. There is unusually little pigment about the ciliary processes and iris of this specimen. 23.20. The Greater Arterial Circle of the Iris. Hunterian. FF. 24. " The anterior half of sclerotica with cornea from an injected eye; extravasation frequently takes place where the choroid ends and the iris begins; the red circle seen on this inverted coat shows that boundary." 23. 21. The Arteries of the Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 25. A similar preparation, the posterior half inverted, showing the arteries of the choroid coarsely injected red.

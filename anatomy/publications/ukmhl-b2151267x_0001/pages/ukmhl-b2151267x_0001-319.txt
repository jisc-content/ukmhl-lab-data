Absorbent System, and QQ. Absorbents Particularly. In the old catalogue the specimens were not arranged in any definite order in either series.

A large proportion of the specimens is taken from the lower animals; these have been placed, according to the particular part of the body from which they came, along with those from the same part of the human body, this arrangement being considered more instructive than making separate human and comparative series would be.

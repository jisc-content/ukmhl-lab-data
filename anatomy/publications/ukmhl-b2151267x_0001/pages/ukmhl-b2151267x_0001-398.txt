HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 314 21.10. The Arteries of the Spinal Cord. Huntei ian. EE. 39a. The pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and upper part of the spinal cord, the arteries injected red, showing the vertebral arteries giving ofi' the anterior spinal arteries, which ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with branches of the intercostals entering along the anterior roots of the nerves; showing also the origins of the posterior meningeal and cerebellar arteries. 21.11. The Arteries of the Spinal Cord. Hunterian. EE. 44. "A foetal medulla spinalis, finely injected red, dura matral coat removed except on the sides." The spinal cord is propor- tionately longer, and the cauda equina shorter than in the specimens from older subjects. (6) The Brain and its Membranes. (a) the membranes. 21.12. The Dura Mater of the Upper Surface of the Brain. Hunterian. E. 4. The dura mater of the upper surface of the brain injected red, showing the branches of the middle meningeal artery. The dura mater of the brain differs from that of the spinal cord in being also the periosteum of the neighbouring bone. It is much more vascular than that of the spinal cord, but most of its vessels go to the bones of the cranium. It is also split to form venous sinuses, which carry off the blood from the brain, and communicate with the veins of the diploe. See Nos. 21.14 to 21.16. 21.13. The Dura Mater of the Upper Surface of the Brain. The Falx Cerebri. Hunterian. E. 4a. A similar preparation, but better spread out, to show also the internal surface and the falx cerebri. 21.14. The Dura Mater and Longitudinal Sinus. Hunterian. E. 46. The upper half of the dura mater dried and varnished, and the superior longitudinal sinus and a number of veins entering it

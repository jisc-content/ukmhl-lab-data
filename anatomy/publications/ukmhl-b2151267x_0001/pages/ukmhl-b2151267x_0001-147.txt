INJURIES OF BONE. G3 3.75. Comminuted Fracture of Head of Tibia and Fibula. Suppuration. Penetration of Anterior Tibial Artery. Jeffraij Collection. Parts of right tibia and fibula, with adjoining soft parts injected and dissected. No history. This would seem to be a case of compound fracture, possibly gun-shot, of the leg about 5 cm. below the knee. About 2-5 cm. of the shaft of the fibula just below the head is wanting : about 7-5 cm. of the bone below the gap is bare and eroded. The tibia can be seen to have been considerably comminuted; the lower fragment is displaced forwards, and on its outer side the periosteum is thickened and raised from the bone. Between the tibia and fibula is a space, from the smoothness of its walls resembling an abscess cavity, at the upper part of which is seen the anterior tibial artery opened for about 1 cm. just after it leaves the popliteal. The hole in the artery is marked by a piece of wood. Shows a fracture complicated by injury of a large blood- vessel. 3.76. Badly United Fracture of Tibia. Upper Third. Hunterian. Right tibia, head absent, macerated and dried, showing the above. The upper fragment sticks out badly to the inner side. It has been fairly recent, probably compound, and followed by osteitis extending up and down the whole length of the bone. There does not appear to have been any necrosis. The osteitis was in the stage of rarefaction of bone : the callus uniting the fragments is very pprous. 3.77. Old Fracture at Junction of Upper and Middle Thirds of Tibia. Hunterian. Right tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. There is a very marked bend backwards at the junction of the upper and middle thirds with a certain amount of irregularity behind, which suggests an old fracture with backward projection of the upper fragment. The line of the anterior edge of the tibia is absol- utely unbroken, and the grain of the bone suggests bending rather than breaking; possibly an incomplete fracture; very old standing.

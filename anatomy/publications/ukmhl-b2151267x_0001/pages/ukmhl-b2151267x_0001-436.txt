HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 352 23.38. The Capsulo-pupillary Membrane. Hmiterian. FF. 58. The anterior part of the choroid and iris injected red, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing the above very beautifully. Quite perfect. (Not described in the old catalogue.) (c) The Pigmented Tissues of the Eye. 23.39. The Pigmented Layers of the Sclerotic and Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 64. An eyeball, the sclerotic divided all round—part removed, part inverted—showing the membrana fusca lining its inner surface, and on the choroid the membrana suprachoroidea (with which it is intimately connected), being the pigmented layers of the sclerotic and choroid respectively. There is more pigment than usual. The veins of the choroid are injected white. 23.40. Section of the Eye showing the Pigment Layers. Hunterian. FF. 62. An eyeball divided longitudinally, showing the above. The pigmentation is not so deep as in the preceding. There is very little in the sclerotic and exterior of the choroid. On the inside of the choroid is a layer of pigment belonging to the pigmented hexagonal-celled layer of the retina, which usually, as in this specimen, adheres to the choroid in a dissection, but belongs developmentally and physiologically to the retina. The optic nerve in section is seen to be continuous with the retina; the relation of the inner parts is distorted by the shrinking of the vitreous humour. 23.41. The Pigment of the Ciliary Processes and Iris. Hunterian. FF. 65. Anterior portion of an eye, showing the above. The pigment has been removed from the greater part of the iris. The pig- ment lining the back of the iris is seen continuous with that of the ciliary processes and retina.

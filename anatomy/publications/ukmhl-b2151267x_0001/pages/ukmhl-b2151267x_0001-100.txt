16 HUNTERIAN ANA TOMICAL CATALOGUE. Hyoid Bone. 1.73. Five Hyoid Bones "at different ages." Hunterian. N. 131. Showing the centres of ossification in each, which are injected black. The black has faded, but the osseous portions are readily distinguishable. The smallest is entirely cartilaginous. 1.74. "Hyoid Bone, and Laryngeal Cartilages of a Child." Hunterian. N. 77. Showing three centres of ossification, one for the bod)' and one for each greater cornu. The lesser cornua are only small pieces of cartilage. Development of the Vertebral Column. 1.75. Vertebral Column of a Foetus at about 4 months. Hunterian. N. 54. There is a centre of ossification in the body and in each lamina of the vertebrae. The spine and transverse processes and most of the body are of cartilage. The last sacral and all the coccygeal vertebrae are entirely cartilage. 1.76. The Vertebral Column of a Foetus at "about 4 months." Hunterian. N. 54a. A little older and larger than the preceding. Ossification is in much the same stage. The centres are much better shown, the bone being coloured black, " by some solution of a metal, probably." 1.77. Longitudinal Section of the Bodies of a Vertebral Column at about 5 months. Hunterian. N. 55. Injected red. The centres of ossification and the points at which the nutrient vessels enter the vertebrae are picked out by the injection. The section shows mostly the centres for the bodies, here and there also portions of the centres for the laminae. 1.78. The Vertebral Column of a Foetus of about 6 months. Hunterian. N. 56. The ossifications are coloured green. The lateral centres are seen to have extended to the corners of the bodies of the vertebrae.

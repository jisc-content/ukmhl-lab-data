INFLAMMATION OF BONE DUE TO SYPHILIS. 117 (1) Changes in the form of Periostitic Newformation of Bone w a more or less general Enlargement and Condensation. 5.125. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus. Hunterian. A rather small right humerus macerated and dried, showing slight thickening of the lower third by a thin rather patchy crust of perio- steal new bone. The old solid shell under the crust slightly more porous than normally. Probably syphilitic. 5.126. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus. Hunterian. A small left humerus macerated and dried, showing a node of fairly dense periosteal bone about the middle. Probably syphilitic. 5.127. General Enlargement of the Humerus. Probably Syphilitic. Hunterian. A large humerus macerated and dried, showing the above. The whole bone is considerably enlarged and heavier than normal, and its surface from end to end is rough and irregular, its appearance suggesting periostitic thickening of old standing. It is more porous than a normal shaft. Probably syphilitic. 5.128. Syphilitic Node on Radius. Hunterian. A radius macerated and dried. For about 6 cm. the inner half of the circumference of the middle of the shaft is covered with a fairly thick crust of porous periosteal new bone, making a spindle- shaped swelling. Probably a syphilitic node. 5.129. Syphilitic Enlargement of Radius and Ulna. Early Stage. Hunterian. Right radius and ulna macerated and dried, showing the above. The middle of the radius is enclosed in a sheath of porous new bone, making a spindle shaped swelling extending about two-thirds of its length. Part of the new crust and the underlying old dense shell seems to be undergoing rarefaction and re-absorption. The ulna is covered from the lower third up to the end of the olecranon with a similar crust of bone, thickest above the middle and on the posterior surface. The articular surfaces of the head of the

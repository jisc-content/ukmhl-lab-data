IIUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 58 there is not much thickening of the bone, but the lower end is everted to an extent which must have very seriously interfered with locomotion. 3.61. United Complex Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Very Bad Eversion. Hunkrian. Right femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. There has been considerable splintering of the bone in various directions, mostly oblique. The fracture has united very strongly, the frag- ments being all soldered solidly together by the callus. The lower end of the bone is so much everted as to look almost directly outwards, which must have greatly impaired the usefulness of the limb. 3.62. United Oblique Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Slight Inversion. Hvntermn. Right femur macerated and dried, showing the above. A grave- yard specimen. Good firm union with little deformity. 3.63. Badly United Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Marked Riding- and Shortening. Hunterian. Left femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The frag- ments overlap about 3 inches, and the upper has been displaced very much in front of the lower. They are united firmly by a large mass of callus. There is slight inversion of the lower end. There must have been 14 or 15 cm. of shortening, and great lameness resulting therefrom. 3.64. Badly United Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Marked Shortening and Inversion. Hunterian. Right femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The deformity is like that in the last specimen, but not so bad. There is a large hole in the callus, but the union is quite firm and strong.

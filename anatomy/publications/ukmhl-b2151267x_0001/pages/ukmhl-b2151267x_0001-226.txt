The right condyle is rotated inwards, so that its longitudinal axis (produced forwards) meets the corresponding axis of the left condyle fully â€¢8 mm. to the left of the median line. The elevation extends back on the right almost to the inferior curved line, at which region the displaced and the normal portions of bone make an angle so sharp as to suggest that there had once been a fracture. On the left there is only a slight increase of the natural curve of the bone. The petrous bones appear to be bent and the apices raised, and also to be rotated on their axes so as to raise the posterior borders. The alterations probably occurred while the bones were young, growing, and partly cartilaginous. There is also osseous ankylosis of the bodies, articular processes, and laminae of the axis and third cervical vertebra to one another.

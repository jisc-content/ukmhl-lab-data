5 THE BONES OF THE SKULL. 1.13. The Frontal Bone. Hunterian. I. 14. Lower part of the frontal bone, injected red, cleared with acid, dried and mounted in turpentine. Shows a large amount of highly vascular diploe in the thick supra-orbital ridges and external angular process, and a small amount in the thin orbital plates. From the abundance of blood-vessels it is of a fine red colour; a beautiful preparation. 1.14. The Sutures of the Skull Bones. H\mterian. I. 15. Half calvarium, "injected red, made transparent in an acid, dried and varnished," showing the spaces of the diploe of the different bones continuous at the sutures. 1.15. The Sphenoid Bone. Hunterian. I. 10. " The sphenoid bone, injected red, and semi-transparent from having been steeped in an acid." The soft parts, including the medulla of its cancellous basilar portion, have also been very perfectly removed. It is mounted in the usual way, in spirit, which does not clear it to anything like the extent that turpentine does. Shows the various surfaces for articulation with the surrounding bones. 1.16. The Ethmoid Bone. Hunterian. /. 11. A similar preparation of the ethmoid bone. It hangs by the crista galli, on either side of which are seen the horizontal or cribriform plates, perforated for the passage of the olfactory nerves. On either side are the lateral masses built up of thin plates of bone enclosing air cells. Below are seen the middle turbinate bones, the curled continuations of the internal plates of the lateral masses, and the perpendicular plate which forms the upper part of the nasal septum. Bones of Face. See Series 29, Teeth; and 17, Nose and Mouth. The Periosteum, Blood-vessels, and Marrow of Bones. 1.17. The Periosteum. Hunterian. K. 1. " The half of a tibia, sawn lengthways, from a young lad : the periosteum is turned off on one side from top to bottom, and is

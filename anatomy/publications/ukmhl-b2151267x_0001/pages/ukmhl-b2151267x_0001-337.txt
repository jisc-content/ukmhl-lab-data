THE LYMPHATICS OF THE INTESTINES. 253 vessels. The glands are arranged, as in the preceding, in an inner and an outer circle, between the branches of the artery " to the number of 50 or 60," and the edge is greatly plicated to increase its circumference. 12.68. The Lymphatics of the Intestine. Lacteals. Hunterian. D. 2b, A portion of the small intestine slit open along its mesenteric attachment, stripped of peritoneum, and mounted on blue glass. " The veins are injected black," " and the lacteals, filled with coagulated chyle," which is of a white colour, are seen accom- panying them, frequently two to each vein. 12.69. The Lymphatics of the Intestines. Lacteals. Hunterian. D. 2c. A portion of the intestines with part of its mesentery, treated in the same way as the preceding, but the blood-vessels not injected. A number of the lacteals, filled with coagulated chyle, are particularly well seen crossing the mesentery to enter a small lymphatic gland. The column of white chyle presents interrup- tions due to the valves, but the absence of distension prevents the beaded appearance which is seen in those injected with mercuryâ€”the appearance here is more natural. 12.70. Lacteals and Mesenteric Glands. Hunterian. B. 4:7a. A portion of the intestine and mesentery, the arteries injected red. Numerous lymphatic vessels filled with coagulated chyle are seen, running in the course of the blood-vessels, to enter lymphatic glands; they show the characteristic interruptions where the valves intersect the column of chyle. 12.71. The Lymphatics of the Intestine and Lymphatic Glands. Hunterian. D. 9. A similar preparation, but the lacteals injected with mercury, the valves showing very well. "A piece of jejunum, the arteries and veins injected red, from a lady."

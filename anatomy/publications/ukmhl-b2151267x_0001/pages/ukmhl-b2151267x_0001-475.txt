MEALING OF WOUNDS IN THE SKIN. 391 highly vascular appearance ; here and there the granulating surface appears bright red also. The deep surface of the specimen is highly injected and of a bright red colour. 28.2. Cicatrix of an Ulcer. Negro. Eunterian.^II. 25. " A portion of skin with a large cicatrix, from a negro." The cuticle is turned down, showing the cicatricial contracted new skin, which is wrinkled, but is whiter, thinner, and of smoother apjiearance than the old skin from the absence of hairs and the pores connected with the sweat glands. The cuticle corresponding to the cicatrix is distinctly thinner and lighter in colour than the normal cuticle, owing to the rete mucosum, which contains the greater part of the pigment, not being regenerated over the surface of a wound. Compare next specimen. 28.3. Cicatrix of an Ulcer. Negro. Huntenan. II. 25ft. " A portion of the skin from the top of the shoulder of a negro," showing the above. It is a dull white mark, much lighter than the surrounding tissue, " as if the rete mucosum had not been regenerated, or were no longer of a black colour." Compare the preceding. 28.4. Cicatrix of an Ulcer. White Man. Hmterian. II. 26. A portion of skin injected red, showing a healed ulcer. The cuticle, which is very thin, is raised in part, showing the new-formed cicatricial tissue fairly vascular. 28.5. Cicatricial Condition of the Skin from Over- distension. Hunterian. II. 43. " A portion of skin from the belly of a woman who had borne children; it is full of marks like cicatrices, as if in the dis- tension some new skin had been inserted or formed in different parts, which is whiter and thinner than the originally formed skin."

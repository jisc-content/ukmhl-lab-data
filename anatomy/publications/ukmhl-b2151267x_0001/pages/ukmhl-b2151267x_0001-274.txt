190 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 8.3. Hyaline Degeneration of Muscle. Hunterian. H. 17. Another portion of gastrocnemius from the same case as the preceding. "The muscular fibres as white as those of the covering tendon, and at some little distance not to be distinguished." 8.4. Hyaline Degeneration of Muscle. Hunterian. H. 17a. Another portion of the same. " The coagulated blood in the veins well seen." Partly macerated to separate the fibres. 8.5. Ossifications in Muscles. Hunterian. H. 20. " Small portions of muscles with very large ossifications in them, a circumstance universal in this body (dissecting room)." 8.6. Ossification of Tendon of Adductor Magnus. Hunterian, Right femur macerated and dried, showing a spine of bone, 3'5 cm. long and 6 mm. in diameter, rising from the top of the inner tuberosity of the femur in the position of the adductor tubercle. It is composed of cancellous tissue, with a thin outer shell of dense smooth bone. Its upper end is broken, so that it does not include all of the original outgrowth. Compare Nos. 5.168 and 5.169, Exostoses. 8.7. Ossification of the Tendinous Arch of the Adductor Magnus. Himterian. Left femur macerated and dried, showing on the posterior surface, just internal to the inner ridge of the linea aspera, a process of bone about 1 "5 cm. long by about 1 cm. broad at its base in the vertical line and about 5 mm. in the transverse, of triangular shape, with an elongated rather hooked apex. It projects inwards, and is curved with its concavity on the anterior surface and the hooked end pointing downwards. From its base a flat outgrowth of bone, about 1 cm. wide by from 2 to 4 mm. high, extends about 3 cm. down the shaft. The hooked process is rather higher up on the shaft than the arch for the femoral vessels usually is, but very near their line, and its shape certainly suggests that it was formed in the arch through which they pass from the inside of the thigh to the popliteal jspace.

23 DEVELOPMENT OF THE UPPER LIMBS. 1.115. Lower End of Humerus at about 5 years. Hwderian. N. 27. Shows the large centre for the radial head and a small one for the internal condyle, which usually appears just about this age. 1.116. The Lower End of the Humerus at 5 or 6 years. Hnnterian. N. 28. Injected red; showing ossification rather further advanced. The epiphysis for the internal epicondyle absent. Four cm. above the internal condyle there is a little curved bony process five mm. long projecting from the internal border of the shaft downwards and inwards and slightly forwards. It is a fairly common anomaly, and is analogous to the supra-condyloid foramen of certain lower animals. 1.117. Bones of Forearm and Hand of a Child "at 12 months." Hnnterian. N. 9G. 1.118. Upper Ends of Ulna and Radius about 5th year. Hnnterian. N. 30. A large centre of ossification in the head of the radius, l^ut none in the olecranon. In turpentine. 1.119. The Lower Ends of the Ulna and Radius about the 5th year. Hunterian. iV. 31. A large ossification in the epiphysis of the radius, a very small one in that of the ulna. In turpentine. 1.120. Scaphoid, Semilunar, and Cuneiform Bones "from a subject about 4 years old." Hunterian. N. 49. Injected red and in turpentine. Shows each bone ossifying from a single centre, that in the scaphoid being very small. 1.121. Bones of Hand from a Foetus "at 6i months." Hunterian. N. 90. Cleaned, dried, and mounted on blue paper.

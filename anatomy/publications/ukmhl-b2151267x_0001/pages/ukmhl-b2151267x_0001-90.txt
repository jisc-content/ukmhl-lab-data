Also shows the epiphyses and epiphysial layers of cartilage. 1.18. Periosteum and Ligaments of Sternum and Ribs. Hunterian. K. 2. " The fibres of the ligaments between the ends of the ribs and sternum, diffusing themselves over the sternum, and forming periosteum." This and the four succeeding specimens were in- tended by Dr. Hunter to show the continuity of ligaments and tendons with the periosteum, and their similarity in structure; the chief difference being the superior vascularity of periosteum, which has, " besides its own proper vessels, a vast number of vessels going to the bones distributed upon it." (Lectures, p. 198, MS. KC.S.Eng., 42. c. 28). 1.19. Periosteum and Interosseous Ligament. Hunterian. K.S. " The periosteum investing the radius and ulna in a young subject, continued to form the interosseous ligament." 1.20. Periosteum and Interosseous Ligament. Hunterian. K. 3a. " A similar preparation as regards the interosseous ligament between tibia and fibula." 1.21. Blood-vessels of Periosteum. Hunterian. K. 5. "Tibia and fibula of a young subject; shows the vessels of periosteum injected red; shows periosteum forming also the in- terosseous ligament, and a portion of it turned down about the middle of the tibia shows its thickness." 1.22. Blood-vessels of the Periosteum. Hunterian. K. 5. " The middle or body of the thigh bone in a child. Periosteum, removed through nearly its whole length on the forepart, shows it of nearly equal thickness, adhering very firmly to the bone; and the arteries injected red show it very vascular." Part of it is dissected so as to appear to be "made up of several laminae."

HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 318 21.30. The Medulla Oblongata, Pons Varolii, and Fourth Ventricle. Hunterian. EE. 24. Similar to the preceding, but more dissected. There is not so much of the medulla; the olivary bodies are clearer. 21.31. The Medulla Oblongata, Pons Varolii, and Fourth Ventricle. Hunterian EE. 20a. Similar to No. 21.27, but including also the crura cerebri. In front of the pons are seen the two corpora albicantia, formed by the doubling of the anterior crura of the fornix. On the floor of the fourth ventricle bristles are placed under the striae acusticaeâ€” bundles of fibres vi^hich join the aixditory nerves. A cut has also been made between the corpora quadrigemina opening the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum or aqueduct of Sylvius. 21. 32. The Medulla Oblongata. Hunterian. EE. 23. A portion of the above, to show the olivary bodies and anterior pyramids. 21.33. The Medulla Oblongata of a Child. Hunterian. EE. 23a. Similar to No. 21.27, from a child of five months, showing the olivary bodies and columns of the cord very distinctly. 21.34. The Medulla Oblongata, Pons Varolii, and Crura Cerebri. Hunterian. EE. 22. The above, with the pia mater, basilar artery, and nerve roots in situ, showing their general relations; the fourth ventricle, aqueduct of Sylvius, and third ventricle laid open. The basilar artery lies on the pons Varolii. A little above the pons are seen the corpora albicantia, indicated by a bristle. 21.35. The Medulla Oblongata and Crura of the Cerebrum and Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 20. Dissection showing the above. Part of the cerebellum is left, but the cerebrum is cut away in front of the corpora quadrigemina, which are also cut away on the right side. A bristle is passed
